THE festival at old Dinah's had been attended by an unex- pected, and certainly very unwelcome guest; but of his pre- sence as yet, no one of the party had been conscious. He camne just after the others were assembled, - with a slow and noiseless step, and stationing himself outside the window, did not hesitate to take every advantage  of acquainting him- self with what was doing in the cottage, which the raised sash and widely opened blinds afforded. Not a person moved, or a word was spoken, but he saw and heard all, and there, throughlout the evening he remained, as if rooted to the spot, I until signs of the breaking up of the company warned him it Iwas time for him to be gone. Slowly and stealthily he again moved away, nor even Nep, though he lay crouched, just in- side of the cotta(ge door, gave one note of warning. :Mr. Roogers did not forget, that we should be thankful for i the pleasant things in life--and among the pleasantest of I these, according to his social humor--was the ' assembling of a few friends.' Before breaking up, he had, therefore, request- ed the company to unite with him in prayer, and it must be confessed, that had the petition offered, been less rambling, and  &#xD;<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC7089-00000003"/> 4          CHESTNUT 'WOOD. a little more suited to the occasion, quite as many would have gone away 'edifiecd7. As it was, M3rs. Rogers, as she always made it a point of duty to do, made two or three rather futile attempts to follow him, and came with his 'Amen,' to the con- clusion that he certainly was gifted beyond the ordinary stand- rd of ministerial talent - and Dinah, with bowed head, and clasped hands--fervently joined in every verse of scripture which he quoted, and even audibly repeated with him, the clos- ing sentence,' Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and forget not all his benefits'--and late that night, long after every other person present was asleep - Dinah lay repeating to herself, over and over again, these precious words. Jerry had quite pertinaciously insisted on bringing the car- riage from Chestnut Wood to take the city party home, but they were equally obstinate in their determination to walk. The night was clear and cloudless, the air so soft and balmy, that it seemed to them, as they contrasted it with the close and already heated air of their city home, as if they were inhabit- ing some new world. When fairly out from the house, Mattie, much to her mother's chagrin, forgot all the proprieties of life, and danced and sung as wildly, as when five years old - quite as wildly as if she had not known how to play 'Ascension!' Again and again her mother called her, but it was of no use. Mattie was now, and was to be for loinc years to come, very little more than a child. She had not grown dignified, she was not one whit more erect or lady-like than when she left Chestnut Wood. Her faither rwas rather pleased, that there was no change which made him feel uncomfortable, but her mother could hardly repress her disappointment, at the -total absence of the much coveted city ai'. She hoped Mattie would have brought home at least, something a little distingue, and she glanced from her to Sybil with feelings, which she would not have dared to confess to her- self, much less to others. r   CHESTN'UT WvOOD. Sybil walked quietly down to the borders of' the pond. There it lay, just as still and clear, and beautiful, as when Charles and herself launched out their fairy boat, and came so near sleeping   e mermaids in their deep cavern homes : nately fo. then,1,1L thei alkt1 ic lie ve beforea- S"bil recalled each incident of that time; never before, and never since, had she been so near death, and probably that was one great reason why its memory obliterated all others. Nep, too, seemed not to have forgotten it; for coming between her, and the water's edge, he watched he with a jealous, anxious eye. It was not until after repeated calls fioom those of the party who were more fatigued, or less in love with the scene than herself-- that she could be persuaded to lose sight of the briht gleaming waves; and even then she found so much in the soft murmurin g of the trees--in the glimpses of the stars down through their tangled limbs, and in the hum and buzz of the almost living air---that she walked on silent and abstract- ed. Aunt Mary could sympathize with her--so slipping her arm within Sybil's, they were considered by the country peo- ple by whom they were surrounded - as having been injured by their stay in the city--for their silence was certainly no- thing more, than one of Mrs. Roers's famous cty ars. Fortu- nately for them, their walk did not lie for a long time in the same direction, and as Mattie was to spend the night at the par- sonage,- and Jerry must see that' no errant knight took cap- tive Miss Palmy- they were left to finish their walk with no other companion than Nep. It was well for them that they could not see the dark  figure that dogged their steps-,now peeping at them from behind the trunk of some large tree and now loitering, until they were most out of sight, lest some slight noise might arouse the suspicion of the dog. As it w  as, they reached home in safety, and when they  were repeat- ing to Mr.  Atherton, the pleasures of the evening, they did not forget to mention the walk under the soft June sky. M r. Atherton was quite as happy as any one of his family 1.  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7089-00000004"/> 6         Ci{;K 'TNUT WOOD. to be at home again. He was not conscious how great the sa- crifice was to him, until he had been months shut up again in city walls. Indeed, had it not been for the life which the young girls brought with them, he would have found the daily routine more insupportable, than ever before - or he- had now no business; calls to occupy his time ; and all his associa- tions of literary leisure clustered around the Library at Chest- nut Wood. To be once more there, to sit in that old arm- chair, to be surroundedby those choice and beautiful books and paintings which he had gleaned with so much care for years, it was far pleasanter to him than he had anticipated, and as he had been sitting alone, through the evening, he had made up his mind to prolong his stay until he must return to the city. Well, well," he said, as Sybil, seated at his feet and looking up into his face, told him "how beautiful a world it was they had come home to, and how hard it would be to go away again." "I shall have to lay an embargo upon your tongue, or before I know it myself, you will make me forget all the drawing *and music masters, and persuade me to let you waste your time, trying to sketch Pomp's Pond by moonlight, or per- haps drawing the very young and lovely face of old Dinah in black crayon." It was an unusual thing for Mr. Atherton to utter a joke; and Sybil knew, that he must be very happy, so she prattled on to him until he swung before her eyes, his large gold re- peater -a signal for dismissal, to which she was well accus- tomed. What a sweet night's sleep she had in her own room! She did not even miss Mattie, and when with the very earliest morning light the birds wakened her, and she rose and sat down by her open window, everything looked so temptingly abroad, that she determined to go to the parsonage and break- fast with Mattie.   CHESTNUT WOOD.          7 Noiselessly she stole down stairs - no one was as yet up, but Maggy -so having cautioned her not to wait breakfast a moment for her, she called Nep, and started for Hymeswold. If she had been delighted with the softness and beauty of even- ing, she foundl more in the freshness and life of morning, that was consonant with her feelings. Every step she took, the won- der grew stronger that anything could have tempted her away from such a home, and so Jerry wondered too, as, starting for his morning work, he came suddenly in sight of Sybil, with hei! straw hat thrown off, and her hand on Nep's head. Tripping along, like some fairy whom Queen Mab had early deputed to distribute a whole bevy of blessings upon her favorite ,hil- dren.                      H "Where away now!" he shouted, as he came near her- "any meeting of the fairies afore sunrise?" "Yes - a meeting at Parson Rogers's, to which being duly  summoned at twelve last night, I am hastening, answered Sy- bil; but who is this mortal, who dares to cross my path." "Jerry Goldsmith, by your leave;" and Jerry made a low, and by no means ungraceful bow. "Ready to do you service, whatever it may be." "Then, turn around, Mr. Jerry, and accompany me to the parsonage." With another bow, and a face of awful solemnity, Jerry dropped his farming tools and drawing himself up to his full size, with the air and mien of a soldier, stepped a few paces be- hind, and began to whistle in a slow, drawling manner, "Yan- kee Doodle." "You ha'ant heard no music like that, I take it, Miss Sybil  - since you went away," he asked at length -after having gone t through the tune several times, without any interruption from Sybil. "No -none -it is quite a fairy's march. Pray from what opera is it?      A. ,.. A;: ^  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7089-00000005"/> 8         CHESTNUT WOOD. "Now, none of your poking fun at me, Miss Sybil --'cause that aint fair--it's more than I bargained for, and I'll be off, about my business, afore you can say Jack Robinson." "Pray don't, Jerry" - said Sybil, speaking in her natural tone--and dropping back to where Jerry was-"I really want to have a little talk with you all alone, and as I don't know how soon grandpapa may go back, I am not going to lose this opportunity." "Certain not- a bird in the hand 's worth two in the bush; so here now, we are ready. Pray what important matter has the little lady on hand this morning?" "Very important, indeed, Jerry. Mr. Rogers looked poorly dressed last night, so did Mrs. Rogers; now I want you to go around among the people, and collect a plenty of money, and buy them both new suits of clothes. Grandpapa will give , some; so will I, for you know I always have money, and a great many people will 'give beside." "Such as- who?" asked Jerry, with a knowing wink of his eye. "4 Oh, Deacon Jones and Miss Palmy." "There now!" said Jerry, lifting up both hands, "You may as well stop there jist where you are, for if you were to say names all the morning, you would be apt to hit just about as near right. Deacon Jones will give prayers and set the tune at meetings, free gratis, for nothing - a lot of those things, any quantity you want - you may have them, any time, jist for the asking; but when you come to the money, that is ano- ther thing. And then, there is Palmy. Lor' child! you make me laugh! I have lived with Palmy nigh fifteen years, and never in all that time, knowed of her giving away but one -thing, - that was an old red cloak and hood to Dinah, and be- tween you and I, that was like taking her eye teeth, only just like the doctor, when lie is pulling them out, I went right at it, and wouldn't see or know nothing about the faces she made   CHESTNUT WOOD.          9 up. If you can believe it," and here Jerry bent his head down so as to whisper into Sybil's ear, ', all she gave to the spree last night was - a plate of fried dough-nuts! little bits of ones too - not your big twisted things - that look as if a feller might get a bite at them, but so leetle, that he could put in a dozen, and then his mouthl wouldn't be full," she said--and Jerry showed the capacity of his mouth, as he grinned from ear to ear, '" she said, they were more genteel!" Sybil could not help laughing, but somewhere she had read of' "donation visits to the minister," and she was disappointed to meet with an obstacle, in her first attempt to interest herself as a young lady for the good of others - so she went on, to re- peat a number of names, to all of which, Jerry had some equally encouraging answer to return. It was wonderful, that he did not see, how much regret he was occasioning, but he did not, though usually the shades of feeling of those with whom he .came in contact, were known to -him, almost as soon as to themselves, so when at last he took breath, and looked into Sybil's face for her approving smile, he was surprised to see tears standing in her eyes. "La now! what on 'arth is to pay. Are you sick, Miss Sybil?" !  "No, only foolish," answered Sybil, "I thought every body would be so glad to give to our good minister." "Bless your heart, child! Well, when you have lived as long as I have, you will know that nobody- or only a few i angels love to give anything- or anything but the cup of cold water; and as the Bible has blessed that once, you know, why I a great many folks seems to consider it gospel sartain, that they shall march right straight in when the question comes, Have i you clothed the naked, and fed the hungry?"But that ant nothing at all to do with the matter, if you want a darnation visit." "Donation - it means givi'nyg, Jerry," interrupted Sybil.  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7089-00000006"/> 10         CHESTNUT WOOD. "Well, if you want a donation visit-one you shall have, and even Palmy shall give something -but I had rather you would tell me to mow that whole meadow off in one day. It wouldn't make me sweat half so bad-" With his usual tact, now he was awakened to the knowledge of having been giving pain, he began to see everything in a favor- able light, and soon,if the good people of Hymeswold had heard his description of them, they would hardly have known them- selves- but it answered his purpose finely--he transferred the cloud from Sybil's heart to his own, and by the time he reached the gate of the parsonage, Sybil was as pleased, as if she were carrying the proceeds of the whole donation visit under her arm. She tried the back door carefully. It had not yet been unlocked, .so she sat down upon the steps to wait its opening. But the dissipation of the last night-for after their re- turn they had many questions to ask, and much news to hear from Mattie, and the clock striking a later hour than usual before they retired, prevented their awakening in their usual season; and after sitting a half hour, until she was entirely rested, Sybil determined to stroll on to the church. Very few persons were moving.  Miss Palmy Fitch was sweeping off her back steps. Sybil nodded to her pleasantly, but the memory of the little doughnuts was too fresh, to allow of any more -cordial state of feeling. She passed the Rising Sun, and noticed as she did so, a man start out from the door. of the bar-room, and walk a step or two towards her. Nep gave an angry growl, and leapt forward, and the man turned back. "For shame, Nep!" said Sybil, patting his head gently - "that is bad manners to bark at a stranger; you ought to know better by this time." Nep growled again, lower, but still very menacingly. "Hush! you are a naughty dog! I shall send you home."   CHESTNUT WOOD.          " At this moment, the man came out again, and Nep, breaking away, sprang toward him. In vain Sybil called him back; the man was obliged to make a speedy retreat, shutting the door behind him, and even then, Nep remained a moment uttering most expressive marks of disappointment, and Sybil quickened her pace, to remove him as soon as she could, from the possibility of doing any harm. Nep came slowly after her, turning often and looking back, and always growling, whenever he did so. Sybil's nerves had received so great a shock when she was a child, that any uncommon occurrence, however slight, was apt to excite her, and she found she could with difficulty prevent herself now from running to gain the security of the parson- age, so that when she was once more there, instead of waiting to try the door gently, on finding it still locked, she most reso- lutely lifted the knocker to demand admission. It was immediately answered by Mrs. Rogers, who cautiously opened the door and peeped out. "It is only I," said Sybil's sweet voice, and in a moment more opening it just wide enough to admit her, she was pulled in, and kissed, over and over again. No wonder that the door was so cautiously treated, for Mrs. Rogers was in that peculiar morning dishabille, in which no- thing would induce her to be seen by a parishioner. She ::: still retained part of her night habiliments, which, though snowy white, and neatly patched, certainly were intended for no other apartment in the house, beside the sleeping one, but these she forgot, so soon as Sybil was drawn from out of sight of the dreaded parish, and was, in truth, as glad to see her, as if she had been in the parlor, dressed in her only silk TS, ddress. "There, now," she said, as soon as the kissing was fairly through, only to see what an example you are to Mattie, and how little she profits by it. Go up to her room, I dare : ".  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7089-00000007"/> 12         CCHESTNUT WOOD. say, you will find her as sound asleep, as if she had only just gone to bed; and here you look as sweet, and smell as sweet (here followed another kiss) as the sweetest rosebud that has bloomed out this morning. Sure enough, Mattie was far away in the land of dreams, without half so much of an idea of its being morning as she had of the existence of those shadowy inhabitants of that dream world; so when Sybil recalled her to a sense of who and WIhat she was, she stared at her with such a ludicrous look, that Sybil's silvery laugh rang merrily over the house, until even Mattie herself was obliged to join. It seemed to the two girls as if they had been separated some time, and so any one else would have thought, had they heard the constant stream of conversation, which was only interrupted by the ringing of the breakfast bell; but as they went down stairs, Sybil felt that there were two things, of her knowledge of which, she had not made Mattie a partaker One, the donation visit; the other, Nep's conduct during their walk that morning. But the first of these, of course, must remain a secret from the minister's daughter, and upon the other, a reluctance to be laughed at, for the fear she felt kept her silent. A very pleasant breakfast they had. It was so delightful, after the still dull days and weeks they had passed, to both MAr. and Mrs. Rogers, to have young life in the house. Mrs. Ro- gers laughed, and cried over her joy   any times, while -they were sitting at table, and her frequent outhurst of- "Only hear that, husband! Did you ever see such children! 7What would the people say "--at last brought a word of re- proof from the husband - which, as usual, acted as a charm, and quieted her. Then, there- came the family prayers, during which, the min- ister had an opportunity, to show in his usual way, that lihe too, had known what it was to be excited.   CH ST NUrT WOODs.         1 As Sybil bustled about, with Mattie to help Mrs. Rogers "put the house to rights," she very adroitly drew from her, a list of her most pressing necessities. She heard with aston- ishment, how many, many years, that silk dress had been worn--lhow carefully ir. Rogers's best coat had been turned and wras just as good as new; how Mrs. Jones had congra- tulated her on the first Sabbath he wore it, upon its beauty, and said, she was glad to see her minister felt able to have a :  new coat, and how well the old hat looked, when it was new pressed, on the new block, and how she had learned, that she could take a barrel, and make up a fire of brimstone and some- thing else, she would tell Sybil all about it when she wanted to ift try and whiten her hat, so that it would look just as well done as those for which Miss Derrance charged fifty cents; and how many times the old ribbon, with which it was trimmed, had been taken for new. There was the first time, when it was really new;  it was ten years ago. She wole it so three sum- mers; then it had fadled, and so she turned it. Some people thought it was handsomer than it was the first time. She :  oreit two years so, then laid it away two years, then colored it a  beautiful color --very easily made - with lining and cap ribbon to match, and a nec k tie. The color was a very good one to wear; it was next to impossible to fade it, but still she tho  ught she should let Mattie buy  her a new one for another ar, before she came home from New York. Perhaps it ; would be a  good time this fall -for then the season was over and goods were always cheaper out  of season." So   Mrs.  Rogers rambled on, as happy as a child, to have some one with   whom she could speak freely, and discussthe value of a   ribbon, and Sybil ingeniously drew from her the complete history of that world, upon which she was generally so silent, the world of her w  ants and economies. A  s it  came time for Sybil to return home, she found herself often lthinsiilg of the man whose appearance elicited such de- w  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7089-00000008"/> "i        CiIESTNUT PROOD. cided mnarks of disapprobation from Nep, and without giving any reason for it, she begged Mattie to accompany her. But this, Mattie seemed very disinclined to do. She wished to visit many of her young friends in the village; she had, though she did not know it herself, quite a desire to be " shown off,' in her mother's sense of the term, and where a better place than a minister's daughter in a little country town just home from the city. Sybil was not a person to urge against the sliglitest un- willingness, so she called Nep, and started alone for home, but with many quick glances up and down the street, and a secret fear, -which was quite inexplicable to her. If a leaf rustled suddenly across her path, she started forward, like a fi'ightened fawn, and she felt almost inclined to stop, and cry for joy, when she saw Aunt Mary coming slowly along the road to- woard her. YWhen she came up to Sybil, Miss Rogers wondered at her heightened color, and the excitement which her welcome of her indicated, but she asked no questions, it being rather her habit, to allow her young charges to give their confidence unasked, so she only said quietly, C You are a little runaway, Sybil; if you don't take care, we shall have to put a bell about your neck, as they do about the cows in the country; so we nay tell where you go." "Oh! what a ringing, merry noise I -should make," said Sybil, dancing like a fairy, as if to try the music, and then suddenly chancing her tone- "I wish you would, dear Aunt Mary-a bell or anything that will insure my never being lost again. Do you know, all this morning, though it is so perfectly quiet and beautiful, I have been haunted with a fear, no, it is not a fear - but I have thought often of that time when I was carried away to New York."

She did not like that any one should be call- ed upon to give, and refuse. She knew bow deeply any such thing would wound the good man himself. Slle felt more - for him, perhaps, than she would have, had he been conscious what was taking place.                     ' Then, and itwas pretty nearlythe only point of resemblance, X between her brother and herself; her fear of consequences was great. If there should be any disaffected among the parish,  - what better opportunity than the present for maling it known. How easy it Would be to refuse to give; and to male objec-  tions to the thing qwhich, after all, would be meant morefor the recipient, than for the occasion. Many a conflagration  might be stayed, if some unlucky breath of wind, had not just fanned in the slightest manner possible, the half-buried and dying spark; and so - and here, Aunt Mary could not forbear a smile, at tihe fiure which her fears had called forth; many { unpleasant feelings and little dissatisfactions might be forever  forgotten, if they remained buried from siht ; therefore, Sybil  was destined again to have the first words which were uttered  about her plan, those of discouragement.           I, She was not accustomed to disappointment, and perhaps bore  it less well, in her plans for others' happiness, than she would, in those for her own; yet she offered no word of persuasion,  and the conversation passed to the beautiful summer life with  which they were surrounded, and by the time they had reached  Chestnut Wood, the sharp edge of Sybil's regret was gone. 1low could there be room for anything but happiness on such a - b lovely day. Hardly a moment of it all, was spent in the  house, even by M{r. Atherton. He must ride over the whole of his large farm. Jerry was a man to be trusted, he knew; but he had always been accustomed to have his eye upon every part of his business himself, and woe, this morning, to any : evidence of neglect or waste! He w ould surely have discern-   = /             He   CIISTNLNU'l' \T WOODI I  ed it, and visited the punishment with peculiar severity upon the offender, for he always considered it doubly culpable, to be unfaithful to a trust reposed, when left to attend to it without supervision. But no such violation was to be met with. Jer- ry's eye was no less keen than his master's, and being neither indolent nor careless himself, he soon found means to be rid of any workman who proved himself so. Today, he encountered Mr. Atherton, as he Nwas standing looking over a large, very fine field of potatoes. " Pretty nice ! I call that ere, sir," he said, touching his hat, ' ain't another like it in the state, I'll bet. I've hoed every hill on 'um myself; and I'll give the feller a fourpence that can find a weed." " Don't be too confident, Jerry. Unless I am mistaken, there is one so high, that it is peeping way off over the top of the potatoes." " I say for 't, I believe I see it myself; now I wouldn't touch that for nothing; I should be afeard of it. I do think it must be the bean that Jack planted, and some body that ain't got hands must have put it down there. It's sort of mysterious-like to me; I don't understand it." Jerry, in spite of the face which he attempted to put upon the matter, really felt mortified. He had taken special pains with that same field, and considered the carefully cultivated, thriving appearance, as a conclusive proof of his growing skill as a farmer. Mr. Atherton saw this, and said kindly: " Notwithstanding the weed, I do think I never saw a promise of a finer crop, and, take it for all in all, a better kept farm; so I have determined, as I rode along, to raise your wages, and when you get ready to settle down in life, build you ". house, just behind the gar- den in that clump of trees, and then you may cultivate around you, at your pleasure." "You are always kind, very kind, too kind to me, Mr. Ather- 2*  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7089-00000010"/> 8         CHCESTNUT WOOD. ton," said Jerry, his voice trembling and his eyes filling with tears; and I should lbe the meanest dog alive, if I let youL go on thinking so well of me, without telling you what perhaps will make you turn me right off; withoutl a romllnt's warning, and I shouldn't blame you either. I'll tell you right out, and then I shall feel better, let come what may. I lied, sir, the other day. I told a real genuine one; I told it, and I stuck to it, and that, you know, was as bad as lying over again every day, and you ha'nt heard the worst on't yet," and here Jerry's face assumed an expression of great scorn. "I told it to women folks." In spite of his exertions, Mr. Atlherton could not look sober. Jerry was somewhat reassured by the smile, which lie saw playing around his mouth; but still his expression was most woe-begone, and he stood in the attitude of one, who is expect- ing every moment to hear his doom. Well, Jerry," at last said ir. Atherton, having made a suc- cessful attempt to command his voice, " what have you to say in justification of yourself?" "9 Not the first word, sir. It was a lie, and there ain't no mak- ing any thing else out of it." "Then, Jerry Goldsmith," said Mr. Atherton speaking quicly and sternly, " firom this moment I pronounce you - Jerry looked up, but with an unfaltering eye, fully forgiven. Go! and sin no more." "That verse is from the Bible, and so are your feelings, sir" said Jerry, his whole face lighting up with joy, "There say here, about town I mean, that you don't believe in religion, and such things; but I am always reardy to knock a man down when I hear him say so; for if there ever was a Christian in action, you're the man, sir 1 and to heaven you'll have to go, whether or no.' "Perhaps, perhaps, Jerry, there's many doubts about any   ( CIEnSTNUT ArOOD.        19 of us ever getting there; but old Dinalh, she is 'bound for the kingdom,' as she often tells me, and now, what about the wages?" Any way  you please, sir. I am content now; and if you give me more, shall some day be a rich man; that's all." N No special harlm in that, Jerry, if you earn your money hon- estly; so, fr'om to-day we will double your wages, and you may grow rich as fast as you can." Jerry had no word of thanks s; he only said, "As you please, sir'; " but when Mr. Atherton was out of sight, he commenced a series of capers, alike undignified and expressive. After all, there was a good deal of the yankee left about him yet; but his antics were rather suddenly brought to a close, by the appear- ance of a man who started up from behind one of the large trees that bordered the road, as if he had risen from the ground. "Well now!" said Jerry, half aloud, knocking his hat to the side, "that's a freak! Where in natur did that fellow come from? I say, stranger!" he called in a loud tone, stranger! Did you grow up out of the ground? or drop down from the sky? or where did you come from? The man turned quickly, and for a moment seemed inclined to make a speedy retreat; but seeing no one but Jerry, he stopped, pulled his hat a little farther over lIis eyes, and said gruffly, "It's manners in the part of the world where I came from, to mind your own business, and let other people's alone." 'And pray," said Jerry, not at all abashed, "from where may that be?" "From "- The man was ready to utter a profane word; but Jerry interrupted him. "No reason to tell me; I suspected as much when I saw you come up so suddenly.  Can I be of any service to you?'  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7089-00000011"/> 2 O        cIxHESTNUT YWOOD. "No; none, or, yes, since you are so civil, will you tell me who lives now in that large white house, down about two miles here toward the east?" "The same man who has always lived there," said Jerry evasively, for he had employed his time in attentively study- ing the appearance of his companion, and was not pleased with it. "Very civil; has he a family?" "Perhaps he has, and perhaps he has not. If you want to 4 know much about him, you had better go and ask him yourself; or, there he is coming back this way ; if you will stop a moment, it will save the trouble of going to his house." The sound of horses' feet were lheard in the distance, but the man showed no inclination to seek the interview, for instead of' awaiting his approach, he struck off across the fields in the direction of Hymeswold. "There goes as big a rogue as ever trod shoe leather," soliloquized Jerry, as he saw him fast disappearing. "I'll have my eye upon that man, so long as he remains in these parts." Mr. Atherton passed Jerry without stopping this time, to have any further conversation with him, but Jerry was very much tempted to call after him; and give a word of warning, lest he should ride to some unfrequented place, and evil befal him. But before he could quite resolve that he had sufficient grounds for such a step, horse and rider were both out of sight, and Jerry turned whistling to pull up the tall weed, which had proved such an unfortunate comment upon his self- praise. Hardly lad he succeeded in starting it from the ground, when the loud report,of a pistol was echoed and re-echoed from -the surrounding woods. ' I knowed it," he almost shouted, " what a fool I was," and sprang up the road.   CHESTINUT WOOD. Hardly had the horse borne its rider along faster than le flew now; it seemed almost incredible to him that Mr. Ath er, ton could have gone so far, before he heard the sound of the pistol, but there was no trace of him, excepting the fresh print of the horse's hoofs. Jerry began to doubt, wheter , after all he might not have been mistaken, and to slacken his pace as he as mounting a steep hill, when suddenly he heard a groan, not like that of a human being, but still filled with mortal aony. A little thicket of woods was on     d  th oa  a t"P of the hill, anid Jerryl   ther slde of the road at the top ofss the field, at Jerry's quick eye sawt that by the short cut across the fields, the man could have reached and stationed him- self here, before Mr. Atherton could come around by the road; therefore, no lon er doubting , what had happened, he tried to  preiare himself for the worst.

Chestnut Wood was fully two i: niles away, and -Hyrneswold, as far in an opposite direction, 1? q1nd the road upon which they were, was one of the most un- ; frequented near the village; but not a moment was to be lost, : and Jerry was fertile in expedients. He first climbed upon one H,' of the tallest trees, fromn which he could command a view of i the road in eitler direction; no one was in sight. Then he ; descended, and making as soft a bed as he could scrape together a of dead leaves, and grass, between some low ucderbrush, he ;:- almost dragged Mr. Atherton there, and removing carefully all I traces of what he had done, once more climbed the tree for a ::i survey, and started for Hymeswold. ;L 31'r.

This gentleman, fortunately for Mr. Atherton, was truly a man of science, and though he had probably never dressed a pistol wound in his life, understood the-principles of surgery sufficiently to apply them with success. To this Mr. Atherton owed his life. As they came in sight of the house, it first occurred to Jerry, that some intelligence of what had happened, should be com- municated to Miss Rogers and Sybil before they saw Mr. Ather- ton; therefore, very reluctantly leaving the side of the waggon, he strode on with his long, quick steps toward the house. Nep came out, in his usual slow and dignified manner, to meet him, but shrank back quite offended when he found he was not to receive even the usual marks of welcome. But Jerry was glad to see him, fbr he knew Sybil must be at home if he was; therefore he pushed open the hall door, and without having prepared himself with the manner to communicate the intelligence, called:-               ' "Sybil!,Miss Rogers! Sybil! I say, some of you! don't you hear me?" "What is it, Jerry," said Miss Rogers, coming at once to the top of the stairs. "They have shot him, and we are fetching him home." "Shot who, Jerry," and both Sybil and Miss Rogers turned pale as death. "It is not very bad," answered Jerry, first becoming aware from their looks of the abruptness of his communication. "It is only throlugh the legr, it ain't no killing matter, but I thought you had better know before he came, so not to take on any." But who, what are you talking about, Jerry?" "Mr. Atherton, to be sure, and there they are coming lip the drive now."   OH1ESTNAUJT WOO3.         25 Not a word escaped Sybil's lips. Silently sle ,ided downl the stairs, and when Jerry reached the waggon, she was there leaning over it also. Her grandlfatlher's eyes were closed, and his Lreath came so faintly, that   he had no appearance of life. Sybil gave one searching look in Jerry's face; lie understood it and said-- "N To, he ain't lead, he is faintt; see how le bleeds."  "Grandpaa!" said Sybil, in a low, but thrilling voice a step behind satisled that he was still li vingr. By the time they had reaclled the hall door all the servants had assembled, and such a picture of affright is seldom seen. Mrs. Giles trembled so visibly that Aunt Mary wlhispered to her to go away, until she should be calmer; and Maggy stood wringing her haneds, utterin ever and anon, as usual when ex- cited, short ejaculatory prayers, to every saint in the calendar.

It was fortunate howeve:   CHESTNUT  WOOD.         27 her, that the physician now arrived, and she must go, for in spite of all her efforts at self control, her feelings were rapidly gaining the mastery.

It yoolr (grandflather should ask For you," she said at last, "you \would be in no condition to go; what should I say to him?" Tle Words acted like magic. Sybil's tears ceased to flow, and with three or four convulsive heavings of the chest, as if ? the effort were costing her her life, she stood before Aunt AMary : calm and quiet, but with suchl a face of grief, that it almost ;b 'roke her heart to look upon her. The tears were far easier to ; be borne.   The time before they could be again admitted to the room, seemed very lolng to both, particularly, as after every thing  necessary for dressing the wound had been supplied, no one : came out, and hardly a sound was to be heard. A;:i Mr. Atherton had always taught his hlousehold to do every X thng in a quiet and orderly manner, and so fixed had the habit ' become, that even now there was no noise or confusion.

At length the door was softly opened by Jerry, whose face J became at once, the index to matters within.

So Jerry related with less circumlocution than usual, the events of the morning; but before he had finished, a messencger summoned him back to Mr. Atherton's roonm, and Sybil had the inexpressible joy to lear her grandfather's voice, faint anud low to be sure; 'but still he was actually able to speak, and that was happiness enough. In a few minutes, Jerry came out again. "The room was darkened; a nLarcotic admlinistered, strict silence and quiet en- joined; and Sybil could go in and sit by her grandfather while he slept, if she desired." Very noiselessly she stole in, and seated herself by the bed side. Nep got up slowly, and crouching down beside her, laid his head upon her feet. Miiss Rogers looked in, and saw that all was righ ththen went to take fartler, and explicit directions from the doctor, leaving fMr. Atherton to go to sleep, under the charge of his two nurses. When they were alone, Mr. Atherton raised his hand feebly, anld held it towards Sybil. She took it between both of hers, kissed it over and over again, then laid it gently back. But as she was doing so, Nep raised himself up, laid his cold nose for an instant against it, and then lay down again, withl every mark of satisfaction. A smile stole over Mr. Atherton's pale face, and he was about to speak, but Sybil laid her finger upon her lips, and moved away. The anodyne administered nmust have been very powerful, for sleep so immiediately overpowered her grandfather, that Sybil often leaned forward, and listened intently, to assure herself that lie still breathed, and it was quite a relief to her, when tte heavy measured sound of-deep slumber gave her no farther occasion for stuch anxiety.   CHAPTER II. THE long beautiful summer day passed quietly on to its close, as though nothing had happened to disturb its repose at Chest- nut Wood.  The blue sky lay stretched out above the house withlout a cloud, and the green earth around smiled back as joyously as if in ungrateful mockery of the silence and gloom of the house within. Throughout its hours Mr. Atherton lay upon the rack of pain. The forced sleep lasted but a short time, and then the fever, caused by pain and loss of blood, became almost intolerable. "Water! water! were the only words his parched lips attempted to articulate, and the strong man in those few hours, had become weak and helpless as a child. Before night, he was delirious; he said but little, and that little seemed to have reference only to days long past.  The name of Sybil's mother was often upon his lips, but always mingled With words of gentle expostulation and affection. Sybil sat by him, with her eyes fixed upon him, her lips firmly compressed; and at the mention of her mother, her whole frame  trembled visibly. Once she looked at Jerry, as if she rished he were not present; but Aunt Mary, who seemed always by some, magic to discern her thoughts, whis. "Have no fear, Sybil; he will not understand."

The fever rapidly increased; and-at the close of twenty-four hours, .e lie explressed serious doubts as to Mr. Atherton's recovery, and :! advised prompt measures to be set on foot, for the arres of the 1 murdeerere.                            ; The care of this also necessarily devolved upon Jerry, and  ' it was strantg e to see his two natures as the circumstances now -  developed themn. When he could steal a short time from Mr. Atherton's roomn, h1e mounted the fleetest hlorse the stable affbrded, and without drawing rein, galloped to Hymeswold, to ascertain how far his  E orders for the day before had been put in execution, and vith what result.

Wore away the first week of Mr. Atherton's illness, and close of it, the struggle between life and death seemed equal.

A few days now, he felt, must decide the )n, and so he informed the family. ig, anxious, and very wearing were these days to them Kir. Atherton never uttered one word of complaint; but, rational, a deep gloom hung over him, which was )ainful to witness.

Mrs. Rogers had been profuse in her offers of assistance and condolence; but the assistance had been grate- fully declined, and the messages of' regret, never reached be- yond the door of the room, where they were uttered. Aunt Mary had, perhaps, a nervous dread, of having her rather ec- centric relations come into too close contact with the stern and recluse Mr. Atherton; and so far, during her whole stay at Chestnut Wood, she had had rather a difficult part to enact; but she had gone straight forward with principle, good sense, and kind feeling; and certainly she could have no better or surer guides. Mattie was very impatient to bear her share in the fatigues of the sick room; and one day, when Mr. Atherton seemed  better, less gloomy, and less weakened than usual, she was al- lowed to carry in for him a dish of soup. He had changed so much since she had seen him, and was so sick, that instead of doing as she was bid, she put down the  dish on the first table she passed, and covering her face With her hands, burst into tears.  Whly Mattie," said Mr. Atherton kindly, "I thought you  had more nerve than that. Am I -so very much changed?  "Nolo sir; yes sir " faltered Mattie, trying to regain her composure; "I am so glad to see you after so long a time. HOow do you do, sir?" She looked and spoke now, so like her miother when she was struggling with her tears, that Aunt Mary, in spite of all  her efforts, could not suppress a smile, which, perhaps, reassur- ed Mattie more than words, for she sawsshe had done no great  harm; so, catching up the soup, with as hasty a movement, as that witl which she had put it down, she carried it to Mr.  Atherton.               - "How much of a nurse has nature made you, Mattie?'  Ai;    CHESTNUT WOOD.          33 sked Mr. Atherton, for he could not help comparing her by, awkward movements, with the ready ease and grace of ybil. "Not much, I am afraid, sir; but I am sure, I wish to do ell." "And after you have become a little accustomed to my cada- e'ous face, I have no doubt you will be quite perfect. There )w, hold the dish still. My appetite is not very great; I shall )t trouble you long." Mattie's hands trembled so, that Sybil, who had been care- lly watching her, now gently pushed her aside, and supplying *r place, said, "Grandpapa! you must make haste to get well; you ghten us all, when we have been away from you, you look so "You are foolish children!" said Mr. Atherton, fondly," and ist become accustomed, now I am growing old, to seeing me th pale and sick, and some time to living without me." It Was the first time through all his dangerous sickness, that had in the slightest way alluded to the possibility of his ith, and it was quite a relief to Aunt Mary to hear him; for Lny an anxious hour had she passed by his bed side; hours silent prayer that the immortal soul apparently so soon to called into eternity, might not be summoned wholly unpre- red. Christians, Aunt Mary firmly believed, never were call- from time into eternity, without warning of the change which before them, a glimpse of the purity and rest of heaven, nLnering through the twilight of fading life, inciting them, n while here, to free themselves as much as possible from impurities of earth. But it was an awful thing to stand beside what she feared 'ht be the death bed of a man, with whom she had long I daily communion, and to feel that he thought that other id a mockery and a delusion. To see the curtain lift-  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7089-00000018"/> 34         CHESTNUT WOOD. ing that veiled the future, and yet to have him refuse to look with- in. To know that the hand of God was laid upon him, and to have it recognized, as only the blind efforts of a Fate, which could be struggled against, but never wholly resisted. Mr. Atherton had had the good sense as well as the good feel- ing, never to be obtrusive in his religious beliefs; but Aunt Mary was too warm, too much in earnest a Christian herself, not to feel the want which nothing else can supply. She hoped much from Sybil's influence when she should grow to womanhood. But there were years of trial before Sybil yet, ere she should develop into the proper symmetry of a Chris- tian character. Thoughts passed quickly through Aunt Mary's mind, after Mr. Atherton's last remark; at last she ventured to say:-- "c; Were you ever so sick as you have been now? Mr. Ather- ton!!" ("' Never was shot before, certainly," rather coldly answered Mr. Atherton. Life and I are not too strongly attached to each other, we have often been willing to dissolve partner- ship before; but the tie holds stronger than I could have be- lieved; and I must say, it would be harder for me to die now, than it would have been a few years ago. For the child's sake," and heo looked fondly at Sybil, c"I would lengthen out the span. Let me see, how long, Miss Rogers, does the Bible allow us. Three score and ten years, is it not?" ' Yes sir,"' answered Aunt nMary, briefly. .  "Longr enough, quite long enough," continued Mr. Atherton, "and  tlhen, there is something about labor and weakness after that, is there not?" "Do let me bring my Bible, and read it to you, grandpapa," . said Sybil, eagerly. "I can find it in a minute." : "Do as you please, child, I shall not dislike to hear it."  "But you will like to, grandpapa, I am sure." So without ; another word, Sybil brought her little Bible, and for the first " " '               '. j   CHESTNUT 3 WOOD.         35 tilme. for many, and many a long year, Mr. Atherton listened to the words of God. They fell upon his ear, with a strange and startling sound. Long buried memories of the past sprang into life. Back in those younger days, when the future was but in prospect, a form as fair, had sat beside his first sick bed, and a voice as peculiar for its rich beauty, had read to him, those self- salme words. The time between now and then, faded away, vith all the unreality of a dream, and then came the years fvhich had made him what he then was, and at last, the event ,vhich had brought to him so much suffering and danger. There- ore -when Sybil had finished the chapter, he neither looked nor poke, like a man who had received the gentle influences which he good book disseminates, for an angry scowl was on his brow, ind his words were short and inappropriate. "Enough, Sybil, send Jerry to me.*" Jerry was away, but no one hesitated to call him when he vas desired; therefore a messenger was despatched to bring im back as soon as possible. Perhaps it was well for Mr. ltherton that a little time must elapse, before he could come, )r he was evidently struggling with roused and angry feelings, lch as he had not exhibited before since his sickness. By ie time Jerry came in, he was quieted, and enabled to say more )mposedly, thoug-h even now his voice faltered:-  "-Jerry! what has been done about the man who shot me." When Mr. Atherton first recovered sufficient consciousness, be asked what should be done, he had given orders, that a lict and untiring search should be kept up, until the perpetra- Xi r of the deed was found, and that nothing more should be said him about it, until something had been accomplished. But time passed without bringing any result, Jerry had both shed and been ashamed to consult with his master upon the bject. HHe feared he would think him either idle, or aimless; tl charges he thought he could prove to him were equally folnded. Therefore now, he was ready with the account  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7089-00000019"/> 86         CHESTNUT WOOID,  of what hiad been (one and his own vindication ficr his vanlt o. success. Mr. Atherton listened wit'hout once offering an interruption, until he had done; then, much to Jerry's surprise said :- "Very well! Jerry. I do not see but you have done all that can be; now I w'l:i all further search given up. As quiet- ly as you can, withdraw the warrant, and let the men you are employing, go back, one by one, to their respective work. Pay them well, so that there shall be no grumbling, and hush the whole matter up, as soon as possible. Jerry's look of' astonishment had something almost ludicrous in it, but Mr. Atherton was in no very genial mood; so lie only said, in reply to it: --- "Let it be enongh for you to know, that therel is but one  person in the world who would attempt my life; tlhat I know this to be the same one, and for many private reasons, prefer his escape to his arrest. Are you satisfied?" "Can't say I am," said Jerry, making a futile effort to knock the hat, which he had forgotten lie hlad put down in the hall. "4 My fingers have a terrible longingf to meet around his neck. I owe him a grudge, and I likes to pay them kind of debts, as well as any others." ' What has lie -done to you, Jerry?" Done to me! why enough to make hanging too good for him. There is that leg of yourn. It wont be as good as totlher for a year, at least, and then, there is Beppo. Poor crettur, I've buried him, but I am waiting afore I writes his epitaph. Then, there is Sybil, ain't no more color in her cheeks, than a white rose; and Miss Rogers is kind of beat out, and, oh la!" said Jerry, suddenly interrupting himself, " there ain't no use. It makes me madder than a March hare, to think of lektlil tihe feller run loose, arter all this." "And the half you have not yet told; yet still, Jerry, I must say Let him?, go. The gallows never was cheated of one who   CHESTNUT WOOD,          37 more richly deserved it. This last crime of murder is the least of the catalogue ; still, Jerry," and Mr. Atherton's pale face be- came suffused with the most angry glow- "heG must live- enough, go! I am very weary." Jerry reluctantly left the room, and more reluctantly still, he sat himself about unravelling the well laid schemes, upon which he had spent so much time and thought for the arrest of the offender. Such inexplicable behavior in Mr. Atherton, an- noyed, and at times, almost angered him. Occasionally, he felt as if he must go and talk the whole matter over with Miss Rogrers. But his sense of honor, which his long intercourse with Mr. Atherton had so well developed, prevented him; for although no secrecy had been enjoined, yet it was implied, and therefore more bindinog, so Jerry passed through one of those seasons of mental disquiet, which seem to have become rather more a part of his nature of late, and as usual passed out of it, with unfatltering trust in, and respect for his master. He gave the most natural turn in the world, to the change in his course of action, estimated exactly the value of each man's time, which he had employed, and having paid fully for that, presented beside, in Mr. Atherton's name, a handsome sum of money, which more than. satisfied. To the authorities he re- presented the probability of his having escaped from the country in so plausible a light, that they only wondered why it had not occurred to them before, and they pocketed their fee with hard- ly a feeling of regret that the criminal was gone; they had no professional pride at stake. From the time that this matter was settled, Mr. Atherton began to gain more rapidly. His spirits were better. He made great exertions to be up, and as soon as the physician would allow, to move his limb. He called for his books and papers, and when too tired to read himself, was interested in being read to. Sybil was never weary of reading to him. Any thing that he enjoyed, imme- VOL.

The effect of the late incidents had been most exciting to her, for she was now of a suitable age to reflect with care and attention upon what had taken place. She could not help connecting it all with the many mysteries which had hung about her early life, and she firmly resolved, when her grandfather should have entirely recovered, to seek from him the full explanation, which she did not doubt, it would be in his power to give. In the meantime, she became very quiet, more so even, than was usual to her, and the paleness, of which Jerry had complained, grew so striking, that it called forth many anxious inquiries both from her grandfather and Miss Rogers. Jerry was deputed to buy for her the gentlest and most tempting saddle horse that he could find; and to her attach. ment to this animal, when she should once possess it, and be- gin to love it, they all hoped she would owe her perfect restoration to health. ]No one attributed it to any other source than her confinement in the sick room of her grand- father, and the many anxious hours to whch the illness had given rise. Now, that he was nearly well again, and confine- ment and anxiety both past, why should she not soon be well and happy as ever? Jerry felt pefectly certain of this, and never was prouder or happier, than when he led to the door a beautiful little jet black pony, for her to mount. Sybil had never been on horseback; but fear was no part of her nature; and as she put her foot into the stirrup, Jerry said:- "La now! you ain't afraid a bit; are you? Catch you at that. I lways said that you were brave as a lion. But   CHESTNUT WOOD.          39 stop, Miss Sybil; she is the prettiest crettur ever trod earth; the beast, I mean, not you, though that wouldn't be far from the truth; but the horse, it ain't got no name. Baptize her afore you mount her." "A name ; oh! Jerry, she is the most perfect little thing I ever saw. I love her already. There is none that is good enough for her." "There is lots on urm; all good enough; there's Kitty, and Polly, and Dolly, and Susy, and- "And what else, Jerry? None of those are pretty?" "Well," and Jerry's face assumed a very roguish look, "there's Dinah, she will like her namesake." "No, no; I have it now, Dinah lost a sister once, 'a very darling child,' she said,' and her name was Rose; so Rose it shall be. Rose, the beautiful black fairy and Rose's first can- ter shall be down to old Dinah's cottage, to show herself off, to her somewhat older, somewhat less frolicking sister." Up sprang Sybil upon Rose's back; but the horse had no fancy to be so easily mounted. She had a wicked, wilful little eye of her own, and her mistress must perforce prove her claim to the title, so she commenced a series of capers, which soon brought upon her a blow from Jerry's heavy arm. Whereupon, she shook her little head most indignantly, and looked around into Sybil's face, with an expression which ask- ed as plainly as words could, "If she considered that fair play!" Sybil so understood it, and having found that it was not so difficult a matter as it had at first seemed, to keep her seat upon the saddle, she said to Jerry, 6"Let her alone; if she can throw me, she is welcome; but if she cannot, she will soon learn to love me. Gently, now, Rose. There, poor creature, gently, gently," and Sybil laid her little white hand, from which she had drawn the glove, affectionately and soothingly upon Rose's arched and glossy neck. ?-    a.  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7089-00000021"/> 40         CHESTNUT WOOD. "Give her a cut with your whip, Miss Sybil; it will do her more good than all your coaxing." Rose shook her head impatiently, but Sybil continued- i( Gently, gently. Take away your whip, Jerry; poor Rose, there, there." No human being could resist those tones; certainly Rose's little warm heart was made of no very hard stuff, though it was irritable, and pretty thoroughly spoiled; so she began to move a few paces forward, in a most quiet and dignified manner. Jerry laughed. The laugh was taunting, so Rose felt it, and began to falter in her good intentions. "Gently, Rose, gently," said Sybil's winning voice, and with an angry toss of her head, she sprang forward into her easiest gait. Jerry had stood awaiting her decision before mounting his own horse to accompany Sybil, but now he sprang up and rode after her. It was, however, no part of Rose's intention to allow him to approach her. An indignant toss of her heels, as he came too near; or a sudden spring to the side of the road, as he attempted to pass, were all the disposition which she showed to associate with him; so that Jerry at last came to the conclu- sion, that it would be safe for him to remain in sight, and trust Sybil to guide the erratic animal for herself. Fortunately Sybil was accustomed to drive with Jerry in the carriage, and understood how to control the reins; therefore, before she had reached the cottage, she had taken all the les- sons she required in horseback riding. Sybil had been but little at old Dinah's since her return. Her grandfather's sickness, and a certain timidity which she could not explain, but which made her unwilling, even with Nep for company, to go far from home, had kept her more away than she wished, so now, she thought with a great deal of pleasule, of the double surprise which was awaiting the   CHESTNUT WOOD.          41 old negro. She cantered up to the window, and knocked gently upon it. 4 Bless the darlin," said old Dinah, at once recognizing her; and hobbling toward the window, but she drew back with a lit- tle scream of fear, when she saw the horse. "Don't be frightened, Dinah; it's only my little new pony. Come and be introduced to her. She is very beautiful, you see, black and shiny, and I love her so much, that I am going to call her - come closer, Dinah, she wont touch you - there," and the young girl bent her lovely face down close to the old woman's ear. "I am going to call her for your dead sister, whom you loved so much." "Rose! for Rose! dear little Rose! She was ten years old when she died. It is a long time back; long before old Pomp died." "Yes; I know all about her, Dinah, and I thought it would please you, to have me name my new pony for her. So I call her Rose, too. See, she knows her name already." "Ten years old, when she died; young missis! she was the only sister I ever had. She has been an angel a great while now, and Pomp has gone up there, to see her now." It was-all in vain; no point of resemblance could be made to enter the old negro's mind, between the little fiery pony, trem- bling all over with life and spirits, and the lost sister. The angel Rose, who "with the golden crown and the harp was wandering forever happy, amid the streets of the heavenly home." For a moment, a slight shade of disappointment passed over Sybil's face; but even Jerry had not time to discern it, for she said gaily:- "Well, Dinah, why don't you ask me to alight? Have n:t you any of your nice cakes, that you used to make for me when I was a child?" "Bless her heart, plenty.

I don't know what else I am ; but come in, little missis, old Dllah never stops for pray- ing that you may come in." "And don't you pray nothing for me now, Dinahll? 'cause that ain't fair; Miss Sybil is good enough without your prayers; but I am a sinner, you know, and sha'n't never get to that 'heavenly home,' without you fight pretty hard fbr "That you, massa Jerry," she said, turning with the delight- ed look, with which she always recognized him. This house sayS prayers for you, every morning, noon, and night. No, no, let God alone, he never forget how massa Jerry make home for old black Dinah." "Set that are little thing down agin 'um all, will he, eh, Di- nah? Well, a mifghty easy creditor lie will be, if he ba- lances even, on that score. But now, we'll go for Miss Sybil's cakes." Rose was tied to the fence; though at first she was very unwilling to submit to such an indignity;- but it could nothe helped; so she made the best of it, and stood there, paw- ing and neighing in a most impatient manner du'ring the visit. Perhaps it was these sounds that made Sybil eat her cakes quickly, and shorten her call; but she did not forget to bring one out for the pony, who rather ungraciously, at first, smelled of' the savory morsel, then coquetishlly opened her mouth and allowed Sybil to intrude a slight portion between her glitter- ing teeth, and then greedily snapped for the whole; and,   j having finished it, turned around and whinnied for more! Old Dinah laughed.  It was the first time she- had ever really understood what, and whose the pony was; and slowly, through her broken mind, as she heard Sybil repeat in those loving tones, "Rose!" there began to glimmer a consciousness I,   CHESTNUT WOOD.          43 of what she had been told, and by the time they were fairly out of sight, she clapped her hands togcether and looking up, exclaimed:- "Rose!

Little black Rose " and the old negro laughed a lhappy laugh which would have made Sybil quite forget that she had ever for a moment fancied she had failed in conferring' happiness, where she had so desired to do. Making others happy! it is always sowing that good seed, which, sooner or later, shall spring up, and bear an hundred fold. /IIIrL)  L1 r  N'cl L LInLMU LVL*  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7089-00000023"/> CHAPTER III. RIDING proved quite as beneficial to Sybil as even Jerry had dared to hope. Though she never neglected her grand- father, still she required but very little persuasion to make her willing to have a canter with Rose to almost any part of the country near Chestnut Wood. Nep, at first, was a little inclin- ed to quarrel with her new favorite; but when he found that he was expected to be the constant companion of their excur- sions, he began to cultivate an acquaintance with Rose, which promised in time to become quite intimate. There was but one drawhack to Sybil's pleasure in riding; that was that Mattie could not share it with her. She used fiequently to urge her going out upon Rose, but she was afraid to ride alone, and Jer- ry could not often accompany her. Sybil did not like to ask heli grandfathler to purchase another horse, so at last Jerry hit upon an expedient which seemed likely to satisfy all parties. lie took one of the horses which he was accustomed to use about the farm, and putting his own Dobbin in its stead, easi- ly broke the fhrm horse into some gait which made him ride- able foi a ltady. And now, day after day, Sybil and Mattie might be seen  scouring the country in every direction, as lawless and as free from fear, as if nothing hlad ever happened to disturb their peace.  So glided away days and weeks of the beautiful summer  time, until MAr. Atherton had become perfectly well, and was A j.   CIIESTNUT WOOD.          15 eginning to talk of an early return to the city. It was very musing to him, then, to see how much remained to be done efore such a thing could be seriously thought of; and among le most indispensable to be accomplished, was the donation isit. Miss Rogers had (as she always loved to do to any of Sy- il's requests) given careful attention to the subject; and her )nclusion was, that after all it was not much of an affair; and it would increase her Iriother's stock of worldly comforts, and ive pleasure-to Sybil, she had no right to object; so she con- dlted with Mr. Atherton, and having secured his approbation - though he said " it was a strange idea for a child educated ke Sybil to bring forward" - she told Sybil "she was ready assist her in any way she would point out." "Any way she would point out!" Sybil repeated it after er, half in wonder and half in amusement. What could she "of ways and means. Aunt Mary must direct, "and she ould do exactly as she was bidden; only how should they eep it all from Mattie?" Mattie must go home to make her farewell visit before re- irning to New York, and Sybil, mounted on little Rose, was ipable of doing business for the whole town. How indefatig- ble she was! It was the first time Aunt Mary had ever seen er roused into that kind of action which brought her into con- ct with other people; and it was a wonder to her to see with hat ease, and grace, and natural kindness she adapted herself ,the common parishoners. Mrs. Rogers herself never did 3tter. Jerry ably seconded her; and as the result, a donation visit as put fairly on foot before even a rumor reached the parson- re. It would be very idle to try to describe the sensation hIicl it created there when it did. Mrs. Rogers lost her bal- ice of mind and feeling many times during the day; and even [r.

Mattie was delighted with the prospect of the fun much more than of the gifts, and tripped down to Chestnut Wood to inquire as to the truth of the report. As every thing was ready, there was now no reason why the family most concerned should not be informed ; therefore Mat- tie was duly inducted into all its mysteries and requisitions, and sent home to prepare her father and mother for the important day. There was much to be done at the parsonage. Every inch of the house, from garret to cellar, was to be carefully cleaned. "A grain of dust, Mattie, as large as the point of the finest cambric needle must not be found. Why, how do we know, child, but it might be the mill-stone that would hang around some poor parishioners' neck, and drag tlem down to perdi- tion!" "Would that be what theologians call imputed sin, papa?" asked Mattie, gravely. ( Perhaps your mother can answer you better than I can," answered the minister, trying to look sober. "Sometimes she has a theology of her own, which we don't find in our books." "Not even in Edwards on the Will, papa," asked Mattie, archly. "No, more likely in Edwards on the Affections. That is rather more in her line of study." Mrs. Rogers saw that they were amusing themselves at her expense, but did not care, so long as the grain of dust was re- moved, so she worked on, and succeeded before night, in work- ing herself and every one else in the house into a most complete state of fatigue and ill humor. Mattie wished a hundred times, there was never to be such a thing as a donation visit, and even the good gentle husband, had to repeat "Wife, wife!" much oftener and in a more authoritative manner than usual.   CHESTNUT WOOD.          47 What a numerous class of women, after all, Mrs. Rogers represented.

It is a good old saying, " that cleanliness is next to godliness;" but no philosophy, human, or divine, ever put it first, without literally making the grain of dust, in Mrs. Rogers's language, "the drowning millstone." Never was Rose more welcome, than when she came pranc- ing into the yard of the parsonage, bringing Sybil with her. Her presence promised a relief for the present, from all active employment, and both Mr. Rogers and Mattie, were quite de- monstrative in their joy. Mrs. Rogers considered circumstances a sufficient apology, and did not allow her scouring to be interrupted, though she lent so listening an ear to the conversation that was going on in the sitting room, that she became quite bewildered, and Mat- tie, who could not refrain from watching her through the door, with that sort of fascination, which frequently attends the sight of unpleasant objects, informed Sybil, with a delighted face, that her mother was preparing to go over the same place, with her washing (cloth for the third time. Not one of the lookers on, however, dared to interfere; but Mattie, carefully laid up the incident for future use. The third day of September was the great day, and as soon after as possible, the family at Chestnut Wood were to return to the city; but at present nothing was spoken, and very little thought of; but the donation visit. Early in the morning, presents were to begin to be sent. At two the company were to assemble, and festive enjoyments were to fill up the hours until precisely nine, when the party was expected to break up. There was no sleep on the night previous, for Mrs. Rogers at  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7089-00000025"/> 48         CHESTNUT WOO), least; she was so afriaid she should not be up in-season, to have the final dusting thoroughly done, and breakfast out of the way. But such fears were very vain, for three o'clock saw her ready, and at four she almost dragged the'tired, sleepy, and conse- quently cross, MBattie, down to a very poor breakfast. After the dishes were washed, and put away, Mattie proposed she should be allowed to finish her night's rest; but the very idea, to the excited, fidgety mother, was like pouring oil upon fire, and the blaze which followed, quite liglited up TNIattie's sleepy faculties. But there is some fear it would not have lasted-long, had not the- timely arrival of' Hiss Rogers, Sybil, and Jerry, even while the gray light of day was just beginning to color the eastern sky, wakened her fully into an appreciation of the pleasures before her. "Now Matilda Rogers," said her mother, as the large, well laden carriage drove into the yard, "see, only see! and they ain't my daughter either." That Jerry was not, seemed to 3lattie a self evident fact; but she was no longer inclined to waste words, and in unpacking the carriae, the duties of the day may fairly be said to have commenced. Presents from the faimily at Chestnut Wood! This had been a day dream of Mrls. Rogers, for long years; now it was more than realized. Mr. Atherton was, as might be expected, almost princely in his gifts. They were too rich and costly fbr the occasion; they almost friglitened . Mrs. Rogers, and after much consultation and many doubts, and fears, it was decided, that only a -part should be exposed to view, and those, too, without the mark, which the etiquette of' the occasion seemed to demand, containing the price of the articles. "Only think, Mattie! of' that molasses colored calico gown, wlhich Mrs. Jones told me she was going to bring you, lying against this turk satin; why this will absolute- - ly stand alone ;" and Mrs. Rogers stood a breadth of the silk up, to show how truly it would bear the test. I'   CHESTNUT WOODo          49 , And this broadcloth, husband! I must cry, and I may as well do it first as last." So the good lady indulged in a sudden and violent flow of tears. "Cry it out, now, mother! do," said Mattie, " before any body comes. I have locked the pocket-handkerchiefs up in my drawer, but if you are going on at that rate, you will want all I have; shall I go up, and bring them down?" "You may laugh, if you have a mind to, Mattie" almost sobbed her mother, " but when you are as old, and have gone through as' much as I have, you will cry just as easily." "May I have as good a daughter, then, to supply me with pocket-handkerchiefs, that's all I mean, mother. Now just look, Mr. Atherton has not sent me a single present. I call that gross neglect." "You ungrateful thing!" and Mrs. Rogers's eyes were dried more quickly than by a dozen handkerchiefs. "How can you talk so, when he has given you for years every rag you wear, and mouthful you eat." ")Do I wear rags, mother? why, perhaps I should, but when- ever I attempt it, this same Aunt Mary of mine, most imme diately objects. I think, but itis a secret, don't tell her, mother;" here Mattie whispered in rather loud tones for a confidential discourse; "I think it is the only old maidish thing she has about her." "Not quite, Mattie, I can tell you some others when we are alone," said Miss Rogers, "but it would be foolish to expose myself before company." "You are very goodnatured, Mary," said Mrs. Rogers, " and most certainly ought to have been married." "What, as a reward? Perhaps I should then have lost this crowning excellence."         4 "Perhaps you would; married life has its trials, all of which, of course, you know nothing about. A woman may be, perfect, when she has no one to cross her, in any of her plans, or wishes; VOI.. II.       5  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7089-00000026"/> O CHESTNUT WOOD but when she has, it is a very different thing; that's the reason, I am sure, why so many more single ladies are good natured, than married ones." "I thought it -was proverbially just the opposite; 'As crusty as an old maid'- 'As sharp as an old maid'- 'As sour as an old maid '- 'As stingy as an old maid;' why there are at least fifty other, equally good and applicable sayings," continued Aunt Mary, dryly. "Or, 'As kind as Aunt Mary '- 'As gentle as Aunt 'Mary ' - 'As sweet as Aunt Mary'- 'As generous as. Miss Rogers.' That is what all the people here say, at least; so let married, and unmarried people alone, mother," said Mattie, "for here comes old Mrs. Nicholson, with her tin pail on her arm." "Husband! just step there," said Mrs. Rogers, hiding away the silk and the broadcloth." "What can the old woman have brought. A pint of' milk, I dare say, and that will be more than she has given away before this fifty years." It certainly was not the best of manners for them all to peep through the blinds of that little window which opened out upon the back door; but how could they resist it? The gift from the people, what an event it was! The old woman came slowly hobbling up the yard. She was a widow, and owned a little farc-m, which she mainly carried on herself, and was, far and near, noted for her miserly disposition. But Sybil had called upon her fbr her donation, and it was the first time for years, she had been asked to give, so the novelty of the thing, and the remembrance of her, as an actual living parishioner, had quite opened her heart, and she brought a pound of butter, made up into little round calkes, all neatly and taste- fully stamped with the old well worn pine apple. Mr. Rogers's rule, for every thing with himn was done by rule, was to thank three times; never less; now, however, he ex- ceeded himself, and three times three would hardly have num- bered his warm expressions of gratitude.   CHESTNUT 'WOOD.         .1 It had been well understood that no guest was to be invited in before afternoon, so the listeners heard her say something about the widow's -mite, as she hobbled away again. "No fault to be found with that, I am sure," said Mattie, as she rather officiously set to work, to remove the butter from the pail. "Yellow as gold, and sweet as a nut. I am really hungry, mother, suppose I try a bit on one of those dry biscuits we had left of breakfast." "Wait until you get some fresh buscuits, pray Mattie, Mrs. Nicholson would break her heart to see even a scollop nibbed off the edge of one of those little balls, before all the parish had seen it. If you are very hungry, you can make way withl the biscuit without any butter." "Stingy woman! well,. I am going back to New York, and then no more starving for me for a while, at least." "Don't say starving, Mattie, even in fun. I shall really think of it, and trouble myself about it when you are gone." "Was there ever such a foolish mother - there," - and Mattie's kiss was not very softly given--" forget all about it again." And in precisely this same way, Mattie and her mother fell in and out, at least fifty times -a day. No wonder, that the parsonage seemed dull to her parents without her. And now arrivals came thick and fast. Mrs. Rogers thought she should have known from whom the respective pre- sents came, without any name being attached to them; and well she might, for so many of them consisted of eatables, and she had taken tea in every family, time and time again. What an array of good things; one whole shelf in the pantry filled, until it could hold no more, with pumpkin pies, another with biscuits, another with cake; one with loaves of bread, and on another, it must be confessed, pretty sparsely covered, pounds of tea and coffee, and sugar, done up in brown paper, as they had been bought at the store. Three barrels of apples, one bar-  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7089-00000027"/> hsi}      CH (IlEST-'NUT WOO(D. rel of wheat flour, two bags of Indian meal, six cheeses, eight hams. Quite fifty pounds of salt pork, brought in different strips to suit the taste of the donor; one firkin of ball butter; two of butter in layers. Surely never want could visit again the larder of the parsonage of flymeswold! And now for the sitting room, across which had been strung ropes, upon which the gifts of a lighter and different kind were to be hung. There was first the molasses colored calico dress, and mo- lasses colored, sure enough it was. Mrs. Jones " thought Mattie was so dark, it would make a very becoming dress for her com- plexion, and she might find it useful, with a little pink bow, to wear when she walked out in the city. She had heard New York was a terribly dirty place, and this was a good color, she knew from experience, not to show dirt." Mattie thanked her, to her credit be it said, very prettily, and the good lady was more than satisfied. There were nine yards of shirting, and six yards of sheeting; three dish towels, neatly hemmed and marked with the initials of Mrs. Rogers's name, and the crowning glory of all, an album bed quilt, with the solemn verse: "Jesus can make a dying bed Feel soft as downy pillows are - While on his breast I lay my head, And breathe my life out sweetly there," marked upon the plain white centre square, and upon every other square of which it was composed, was written the name of the maker and donor. These had been cut of precisely the same size, and after each one was neatly finished, the ladies had met, and had a quilt- ing party, and here now, on the very centre of the line, hung the result. There was no end to the notice and admiration which it at-   CHESTNUT WOOD.          53 tracted, or to the stories which each one had to relate of the difficulties which they surmounted, in selecting just that color, and pattern, for their piece; this having proved to be the desir- able one, above all others. So much for in-door gifts; but the wood-house showed no less substantial proofs of the peoples' good will. Wood enough was brought in to take Mr. Rogers nearly through the coming winter, and wood was a costly, and there- fore most desirable article. The pumpkins too, the glorious yellow pumpkins, how many a farmer had put one in, after he was ready to start, just to fill up, and now here they lay before the wood-house door in one great golden pile; sufficient to have kept a cow had the worthy minister been possessed of one, half the winter at least. Jerry had been sage enough to discern this; so when it was coming time for tea, and the interest and excitement beginning to flag a little, there was suddenly heard a loud whooping and hallooing, as if some one was attempting to urge a drove of cattle through the yard. All hastened to the doors and windows; and there was Jerry driving a cow, and at the same time, a pair of oxen attached to a large load of hay. If they were to be judged by the noise which was made, in guiding them toward the house, never be fore were so unruly animals. Jerry "haw'ed and gee'd," and coaxed, and scolded, until those who knew that never had yoke been put upon gentler creatures, or a more timid, obedient cow been known, began to laugh, and suspect the joke. Still, not a muscle moved upon Jerry's sober face; he cracked the whip and made himself red with his great efforts, until, as he paused before the door, he was received with a general shout of mer- riment. Between the cow's horns there was placed a large placard, upon which was written: "To our beloved pastor; from the 5*  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7089-00000028"/> -54        CHESTNUT WOOD. young men of his flock," and the same, only printed larger, was tied in front of the load of hay. This had been kept a great secret from the female part of the parish, and there was now many a quiet, sulky toss among the pretty heads, as they came really to understand, that for once, they had not been among the initiated. It would be useless to attempt to describe the sensation cre- ated. Mrs. Rogers had recourse to her handkerchief; and even the pale blue eye of the minister faded. Mattie looked really distressed, when she saw her father affected, and for the hun- dredth time, that day, wished the whole affair well over. "We knew," said Jerry, pointing with the end of his whip to- ward the pile of pumpkins, " it would be a famous year for pumpkins, and you would have a lot of them, so we bethought ourselves, you and Mrs. Rogers wouldn't care to live on them, and nothing else; besides, it takes milk to make pumpkin pies, so here it is, all ready to be had for the asking, and the crittur's name is Dolly." A very merry party it was, that pitched the hay into the barn. Laughing, shouting, waking up the mice and rats, who had held undisturbed sway there for many a year, and finally scattering them off in all directions to make room for the new occupants. Sybil, with that peculiar power of adaptation which seemed a part of her nature, had moved around among the parishion- ers, as much at home as if she had always been accustomed to such scenes. Not an old heart there that had struggled with poverty and sickness and sorrow, but some gentle pleasant words from those rosy lips, fell upon it like a beam of purest sunshine. Not a worn, weary mother, who had found anything but rest in the increase of work, which the preparation for the festival had required, but felt repaid, as the young heiress of Chestnut Wood spoke a word of praise for the snowy biscuits, or the light cake which had been the result of her toil.   CHESTNUT WOOD.         55 A blessed thing it is, this power of saying genial words; a rare gift, and one more to be desired, for the heart happiness it gives, than any other from all the full cornucopia, of bless- ings. It was more to Sybil ta-night, than her wealth, or beauty, or talent. The children clustered around her, and many little lips, with an odd mixture of love and reverence laid themselves upon her white hands, and timid eyes looked up into hers, and read there, only affection. But among the guests, was one, to whom Sybil had taken a dislike, for which she found it impossible to account. This was Mr. Frederick Langdon, a young lawyer, who being possessed of a large fortune, and having finished his collegiate and professional studies, had selected Hymeswold as his future home, attracted thither by the great beauty of the place, and the leisure which would be afforded him, of pursuing his lite- rary avocations. Such, at least, was his own story, and with this, he had introduced himself to Mr. Rogers, and to the other principal inhabitants of the village, and having heard of the donation visit, had begged of Jerry, liberty to give with the other young men, money toward the purchase of the hay and the cow, and to be present during the evening. H-e had been but a few weeks in town, and of course, was an entire stranger to nearly all present; and probably, from the air and manner with which he mingled with them now, would have been al- lowed to remain so, until both people and pastor should have passed away, and been forgotten. There was something repulsive to the plain country people, even in his personal appearance. He was small, slightly built, with long hair that seemed to be of no particular color; heavy eyebrows, restless and cun- ning eyes, small, upturned nose, and a mustache covering his mouth, so that neither lips or expression were visible. He was dressed in the extreme of fashion, making much display of a vast amount of gold, in the shape of pins, chains, and  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7089-00000029"/> 56         CHESTNUT WOOD. rings, and moved around among the plain farmers, very much as a peacock, with tail full spread, struts among the plain barn yard fowls; with, however, one important difference, the barn yard fowls might be supposed to entertain some feeling of pride, that one of their species could be so fine; but the coun- try people could hardly keep the word " puppy," off from their lips, or the inclination to turn him out, as they would have that animal firom their feet. This, however, was the last suspicion in the world, which would have occurred to Mr. Frederick Langdon, so he moved around through the crowded rooms, quite as much at home, as -.-. if he were the master of the revels. He had asked, soon after entering, an introduction to Sybil and Mattie, and it must be confessed, had looked a little impos- ing to Mattie. There was something decidedly reminding her of Broadway, in his personal appearance. She was quite will- ing to chat with him, and while Sybil was helping her mother in every imaginable way, Mattie was cultivating his acquaint- ance, in that silent language of looks and gestures which the young so well understand. But he seemed quite indifferent to Mattie after his first in- troduction to her, and equally desirous to obtain some slight access to the cold and distant Sybil, for haughty the heiress of Chestnut Wood in very truth was to him, every time he ap- proached her. At last the long afternoon and evening drew to an end, and the company gathered together for the usual close of such meetings. Mr. Rogers was tired - tired in body and tired in mind. He fell far short of what his wife thought were the re- quirements of the occasion. Deacon Jones uttered a signifi- cant 'hem' when he had finished; and long after, in the silent watches of that night, rang through the house in Mrs. Rogers's ears that hem! After prayers there followed the hymn, "Blest be the tie   CHESTNUT WOOD.          57 that binds" -in singing which no voice was noticed as loud, or more distinct, than that of Mr. Frederick Langdon. Sybil and Mattie were both very busy helping the old and young to find their hats and shawls. Sybil had turned over and over a large pile for a little boy's cap, when she suddenly heard a voice close by her saying - "Miss Thornton, I have an important message for you; where and when can I deliver it?" Sybil started; no one was near her but Mr. Langdon, and so perfectly indifferent to what was going on around him did he appear, that sure she must have been mistaken in supposing she was addressed, Sybil again endeavored to find the cap. "Miss Thornton," said the same voice again, "Did you not hear me? I have a special message for you, that you must hear." "Who are you that dare speak to me in this way " asked Sybil, drawing herself suddenly up, while all the temper of her soul flashed from her eye. "Who, and what are you?" Mr. Frederick Langdon, at your pleasure, Miss Thornton; and, perhaps, when you know- more, you will not have need to ask what my business is. For your own sake you may as well make as little noise as need be about the matter." A crowd of great and small now came pouring out into the entry, in the midst of which Sybil found no difficulty in making her way as quickly as possible to Miss Rogers's side; and she was about relating to her what had taken place, when looking suddenly up, she caught sight of Mr. Langdon near, with his eye fixed steadily upon her. He immediately placed his fin- ger upon his lips, and, with a threatening gesture, crossed the room and stood beside her. Sybil trembled with fear and apprehension. All power, all desire, to make Aunt Mary acquainted with what had taken place seemed to vanish, and she shook like an aspen leaf. Do n't make a fool of yourself," said Mr. Langdon, bend-  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7089-00000030"/> 58        cCHESTNUT WOOD. ing near to Lcr, under the excuse of lifting a book which was on the table beside her. "There is no help for it, and you will be more sorry than any one else if you tell. Act like a woman, and you will be glad of it in the end. I must see you somewhere, and that, too, all alone." "Never," said Sybil; the one short word seeming to freeze to her lips with horror. "To-morrow night, at old Dinah's cottage," persisted the man. "Never," again said Sybil, firmly. "We shall see. Come or not, at your peril." Mr. Langdon shut the book and moved away; and when Aunt Mary turned from the old lady with whom she had been conversing to speak to Sybil, she found her pale and trembling, as if about to faint. "'What is the matter," she inquired anxiously, putting her arm around her. "I am very weary, Aunt Mary. Let us go home quickly. Do not say that I am ill, only do not leave me one instant. Let me go with you and Jerry. Indeed, I am better, and quite able. Come! let us look for Jerry. Quickly! Aunt Mary, quickly." She almost dragged Miss Rogers into the yard, where Jer- ry was busy discussing the superior merits of long horns, or short horns, with a group of men, and so sharp and imperative sounded her voice as she called him "to harness as soon as possible," so little like its own gentle music, that he could think of nothing else, as with more than even his usual alacrity he obeyed her; and the first question he asked as he drove from the door was: - "Well now, Miss Sybil! I should jest like to know what has happened; for you spoke to me no more like yourself than a lamb bleats like a lion. Something has come across you, I know; now what is it?"   CHESTNUT WOOD.          .9 "Nothing, Jerry; or rather nothing that you can help. Only drive me home quickly, and do not ask me any more about it. I am very tired and more than half sick." "As well stop for the doctor then at once," said Jerry, draw- ing in the reins, because I know you 're sick, and pretty bad too, and it will save time to have him there as. quickly as we can. Don't you say so, Miss Rogers?" "No, no," said Sybil, without giving Aunt Mary time to an- swer, "I need only rest; drive me home as quickly as you can." "Well now! if that 'ere ain't curious," was Jerry's only re- mark, as snapping the whip at the horses, they almost flew along the road to Chestnut Wood.  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7089-00000031"/> CIAPTER IV. WHEN they reached home, Sybil found there a visitor, whose arrival was as unexpected as it was welcome. It was Charles Wallace's vacation; and knowing that the family were in the country, he had hastened down, anxious to spend a few days with them there. He had heard on arriving at Hymeswold of the donation visit then taking place at the minister's, and had been almost tempted to make one of the number; but he was too much of a stranger to the parishioners generally to feel that he should be anything beside an intruder, therefore he had resisted the inclination, and driven quietly over to Chest- nut Wood, where, as he had anticipated, he found Mr. Ather- ton spending the evening alone. He was very kindly received; and the almost fatherly man- ner in which all his little matters of study and life were in- quired into, made the young man's heart beat at times wildly with hope and joyful anticipations. He had been a successful student, as is every one who starts in earnest to acquire, who has motive and object. He brought back now no mean report of the acquirements of his first col- lege year. Mr. Atherton felt that the boy was gone, and the man occupied his place. But great as the change had struck him, it bore no comparison to the effect produced upon Aunt Mary and Sybil. Grown to the height and figure of a man, the deep toned voice with which he answered their welcome almost chilled   CHESTN UT WOOD.         61 and repulsed them. Sybil became instantly shy and reserved, and even Miss Rogers was conscious of putting on what Mat- tie called " a few of her old maid airs." Mr. Atherton watched them with much amusement. He thought one day's free ram- bling together over the beautiful grounds would do away all the effect of time and growth; nor was he, as events proved, at all in the wrong. When Charles retired to his room that night, he had a lonely feeling, perfectly new to him. The little Sybil, the child whom he had known and loved - where was she? That beautiful, fairy-like being, with those large, sad eyes, that shy, distant, haughty young lady -how could it be Sybil! There was no- thing of the child left but the waving golden hair, and the soft, ringing voice. And so these two different beings accompanied Charles into the dream-world. But a very different night was before Sybil. \ No sooner did her door close upon the affectionate but rather anxious face of Aunt Mary, than seating herself, and covering her face with both of her hands, she began to weep bitterly. What a bless- ed gift - the power of shedding tears. How it softens and mel- lows our light sorrows, until they become, oh! so much easier to be borne. A tearless grief! no wonder that it saps the foundations of life, and never comes but when the heart is seared or crushed! For the morning and the evening of life God has otherwise mercifully provided; and so Sybil sat to night, and the fast falling tears soothed an quieted her as would have a mother's voice. Gradually all memory of the evening, and those last words, " to-morrow night, at old Dinah's cottage," passed from her mind; and when she laid her head upon her pillow, into her dream-world went also visions of a loved but changed face. Wearied as she had been on the previous day, the night was one of unbroken rest; and she started as if something very un- VOL.

"Why, Maggy!" said Sybil, springing up; "why have n't you wakened me before?" "I came twice, Miss Sybil, but you looked so taking com- fort like, that I could n't find it in my heart to; and now I don't know as I should, only I thought, seeing Mr. Charles had just come, it was a pity to disappoint him." Many a longer toilet has not produced so fair results; and when Charles actually saw Sybil in the door, ready for the ride, he felt more than repaid for his long waiting, and very much obliged to Jerry, who, having heard of his arrival, had come to his room early and wakened him, telling him the whole story of the pale face and the purchase of the little pony; and how fond Sybil had become of Rose; and how early and regularly she rode every morning, inviting him to accompany her, if he wished. "If he wished!" Charles did not even stay to ask himself, but was up and ready, as we have seen, long before Sybil. Mr. Atherton was right in thinking they needed but to be left alone together, a little while, to come to a full recognition; and no circumstances could have been more conducive to this, than the present. The morning air was balmy and delicious; the sky open and cloudless. Nature seemed in that still, soft light, to be reversing her natural order, and instead of hasten- ing on to dreariness and decay, to be- bringing back those delicious hours of " leafy June." Naturally, and without one word of comment, they turned their horses' heads toward the pond, and it was not until old Dinah's cottage was fully in view,   CHESTNUT WO6OD.         63 that the remembrance of the last night's interview flashed across the mind of Sybil. When it did, she turned very pale, and suddenly checking her horse, begged with white lips, " that they might go immediately home." Charles was alarmed, but Sybil gave him no time to make inquiries; giving the rein to Rose, she galloped toward home so quickly that Charles, on his much less fleet horse, had some difficulty in overtaking her. When he did, he briefly asked, - "Are you sick?" "Not at all;" And Sybil commenced talking rapidly on other subjects; but her mind and her eye wandered; and in after years, when Charles recalled this ride, not a word or ex- pression was forgotten by him. They reached home just in time for breakfast, and had Sybil been accustomed to using the slightest deceit, she would probably have availed herself of this as a reason to give for her sudden return; but although the thought occurred to her, she immediately dismissed it. "I should despise myself," she said, " if I would submit to use an excuse which was untrue." How many times during that day, she resolved and re- resolved to go to her grandfather, and acquaint him with every thing that had happened; and yet she was always withheld by the mem6ry of that threat: "You will be more sorry than any one else, if you tell." Ic was one link in that dread chain which seemed to bind together the different parts of her destiny. She knew, she felt, with that chilling presentiment which so often forebodes evil, that, fobr her there was no escape; that she must, sooner or later, be called upon to enact a part for which she could assign no sufficient reasons, and make no preparation. She wished she had done what she had so long intended to do, and shrank from, - seek from her grandfather the whole knowl- edge of her mother's early life. Do what she would, she could not now resist the thought that, in some way, she was connect-  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7089-00000033"/> "        CHESTNI"UT WOOD. ed with the present circumstances, and that, if she herself knew more of her mother, she could act more wisely. As the night approached, the idea gained strength with her, - and unable any longer to hear the conversation of the par- lor, she sought her room to meditate, alone, on what was before her. Seated at her favorite window, overlooking the garden, she gazed listlessly from it. Nothing of the beauty there spread out for a moment attracted her attention. N7ever before had she looked upon it with so unloving an eye. She saw Charles come out, and wander up and down among the beds of flowers. He was lonely, and she knew it; but with no remembrance that it could be at all connected with her ab- sence. While she was almost mechanically following his steps, her attention was attracted by seeing the head of a man thrust carefully through an aperture in the thick hedge, by which the garden was surrounded. He seemed to have seen Charles, for he immediately withdrew it, and although Sybil gazed upon the place, as if her eyes were riveted there by some fascination which they could not resist, he did not make his appearance again while Charles remained in the garden; but no sooner had he withdrawn, than the head was once more seen,--slowly and carefully at first, but when it was found that the ground was clear, an arm was also forced through, and after beckoning three times to Sybil, a note was dropped, and the man dis- appeared. To leave her room, reach the garden, and secure the note, was with Sybil the work of a moment; but Charles had heard her step upon the stairs, and intercepted her as she opened the garden door. "The afternoon is beautiful, Sybil," he said "why do you shut yourself in your room? Come with me to the parson- age.  "I cannot, indeed I cannot, Ch!arles," she answered, hastily,   CHESTNUT 'WOOD.          65 and was passing him to go to her room, when he caught her hand. "Answer me one thing-, Sybil - Have I done anything to offend you? you seem strangely altered!" "You! O, how could you offend me? No, Charles, I will go with you; only wait for ine a few moments." "1I certainly shall not let you go; do you know I have a positive dread, little while as I have been here, of having you out of my sight one moment? Here, Maggy," said he, as MSaggy passed throughl the hall, "please to bring Miss -Sybil's hat and shawl, -I am afraid to let her go for them, for fear I shall lose her. There is something that is positively spiritual about you, Sybil, you seem always to be vanishing out of people's sight." Sybil shuddered; and Charles saw her look over her shoul- der, back into the garden. "Something, I am sure, is the matter with you, Sybil," he said, soothingly. "May I not ask you, what it is?" "Never! never!" she said, with another shudder; "or rather, Charles, ask me nothing; you cannot help me no one can." "But I both can, and will, Sybil; do not treat me so un- kindly." When Sybil raised her eyes, they were full of tears; but a faint smile was playing on her lips. Maggy had brought the shawl, and putting it on, she summoned all the resolution she had, and began a brisk conversation on indifferent subjects, as they started on their walk. But Charles was not to be so easily diverted, and he made many attempts to bring her back to explain to himn the leange which he felt had taken place. They were all in vain; she could not be induced to touch upon the subject again. When they reached the parsonage, they found that there were other visitors there before them; but it was too late to return. 6*  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7089-00000034"/> "         CHESTNUT WOOD. Mattie had seen them from the window, and came flying out to meet them, with as little regard to the strict rules of propriety as she would have shown ten years ago. Her reception of Charles was most warlm and cordial; he had altered, but had improved, and that was all for which she cared. "You are just in time, Sybil," she said, - embracing her as affectionately as if she had been separated from her for years. "Mr. Frederick Langdon is in the parlor, and will be delight- ed to see you. He has but this instant come in; I should think you must have passed him on the road." Sybil turned pale; and, as she did so, she felt that Charles's and Mattie's eyes were both fixed upon her; and, in an instant, the returning color dyed cheek and neck. "Well, now! what is that blush for, Sybil?" asked Mattie; "have you fallen in love with the fellow already? I have, but it is with his gold chains and beautiful mustaches. Come, Charles, I am in a great hurry to introduce you to our new Apollo." Sybil shrank back, but Mr. and -Mrs. Rogers had come out to meet her, and there was no help, she must go in. Her recognition of Mr. Langdon was slight and cold, but hardly more so than that with which Charles acknowledged his intro- duction. For an instant, the two young men measured each other from head to foot, and the curl upon Charles's lip he took no pains to suppress, as he turned away., A glance of deadly hatred shot from Mr. Langdon's eyes, no one saw it, no one felt it but poor Sybil; but it had the power to make her tremble. It was well for all parties, that so much was to be told. Tile donation visit proved an inexhaustible theme, for years, to lIr. and Mrs. Rogers; no wonder, then, that it should be fruitful so soon after it had taken place. And then, the gifts even to Dolly, so quietly ruminating in the patch of yard, must be   CHESTNUT WOOD.          67 sihown; and many an eloquent harangue on the desirability and beauty of a pastolos life, must be listened to by the young men. Mr. Langdon had no intention of being driven away, so Charles was quite willing to accede to the first hint from Sybil about returning to Chestnut Wood, and certainly had it not be- come a proverb from its truth, trite, almost so as to be useless, that "4 a lover's eyes are blind," he had seen enfough during that visit, to have saved himself, and all others present, much future pain and suffering. He wished, when he was again alone with Sybil, to question her once more, not so much about the cause of her unhappiness, as about her acquaintance with the young lawyer whom they had just met. But on the first mention of his name, such an expression of pain passed over Sybil's face, that nothing would have induced him to proceed, even if she had seemed inclined to answer, which she was not. She talked in the same light, careless way, she had in going to Hymeswold; but only once was her expression that of real in- terest; it 'was when inquiring'for the family at Charlton. Mrs.- Wallace had been sick, dangerously so, and it was part of the object of Charles's visit, to beg Sybil to accompany him home, and cheer his mother by staying a few days with her. To this proposal Sybil listened with evident pleasure, and readily gave her promise to do so, if her grandfather did not object, she was almost tempted to say, and Aunt Mary; but a glance at Charles's tall figure, reminded her that she was no longer a little girl, and certainly should be supposed to act for herself. As they approached the house, they saw Nep lying upon the front door step; he did not raise his head, or in any way notice their approach; but as Sybil leant over and began to caress him, he uttered a low growl. "Something is wrong with Nep," she said; " what can it be?" "Here it is/' said Charles, lifting the door mat, and drawing out a little bundle, very tightly tied up in an old cotton handker-  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7089-00000035"/> 68    .    CHESTNUT WOOD. chief; " here is something he has stolen, and he wa s afraid you would find it out. I do believe the dog has sense, or he would never have hidden it so quietly." Charles attempted to take the bundle up with his cane, but Nep snapped at him, at the same time growling furiously. "Keep still, Nep," said Sybil, with the decision and prompt- ness so needed in managing the dog. 'I must see what you have stolen." Another loud growl from Nep, but he stood looking from her to the bundle, without daring to move. Charles attempted to loosen the knots, but iNep sprang furiously at him, this time drawing blood from his hands. "Let me do it, Charles! Nep, for shame, sir! go away, I am ashamed of you." Nep stood still, but in a very bad lumor, and Sybil tried in vain to loosen the knot. "Cut it," she said at length, laying her hand on Nep's head, I' he shall not touch you again." Nep trembled with anger; but that slight hand upon his head, held him, more firmly than iron hands, while Charles cut the ends of the handkerchief; and a piece of meat rolled out upon the stones. "Poisoned meat," he said, surveying it carefully. "Nep has managed to get an enemy some where." "Poor fellow," said Sybil, the tears coming quickly into her eyes, " must every thing suffer that loves me?" and she laid her head upon the dog's, and Nep, as if understanding what had taken place, touched his cold nose against her cheek, and lifting his huge pa-w, placed it upon her, in an attitude at once carress- ing and protective. "Whlat a merciful escape," Charles said; 4' who can have done this? Have you any clue, or reason to suspect any person?" "Not the least in the world; but Charles, there seems to be a - "Sybil stopped suddenly, the color came, and went, and the sentence remained unfinished. *   CHESUTNUT WO01).        69 "A what? Sybil, you have left much in the dark, which I am sure, I ought to understand." "I cannot tell you, Charles. Let me go in, I feel sick." Charles quietly opened the door and let her pass without a word. He was both vexed and grieved. As Sybil was about to pass up the stairs to her own room, she paused and looked around. Charles still stood with his hand upon the latch of the door, but his expression was displeased. "Charles!" she said gently. Ie did not look, and with a flash of pride, so natural to her, she passed on, up the stairs, without another word. In a mo- ment the door closed between them, and long years after, they recalled this, as the first real separation of their young hearts. Sybil had not forgotten her note for one moment since she had received it, and now, for the first time alone, she drew it from her pocket, and without waiting to think, opened it. It ran as follows: "You have no intention of coming to old Dinah's cottage to-night. But, Aliss Thornton, you cannot do as you please; you must come, or I shall take means which may not be so pleasant for you, to meet-you alone somewhere else. You had better act like a sensible girl, and do as you are required, and I give you my word of honor, that no harm shall come to you, that you shall be detained but a short time, and that nothing shall lead any of your friends to suspect that your visit was not intended solely for old Dinah. "So much if' you come. If you do not, you will soon hear from me again." This was very illegibly written, and miserably spelt; but Sybil read every word of it over and over again, hoping to discern some clue, by which she could at least, guess what was intended. As she finished it, for the last time, her resolution was taken, no threat should induce her to go. She would not volunta-  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7089-00000036"/> 70         CHESTNUT WOOD. rily put herself in the power of, she knew not whom, or for what; and if he succeeded, in what he seemed to intend to attempt, it should not be through any imprudence or folly on her part. Carefully putting away the note, she went into the parlor. Aunt Mary sat knitting by the table; her grandfather in dress- ing gown and slippers, the only marks of having been an inva- lid, in which he now indulged, was reading his newspaper by the fire. Charles was not there; but Nep lay stretched upon his usual place, and acknowledged her presence by the wagging of his tail, as was his wont. "Where is Charles?" was Aunt Mary's first question; " he has not been in since you returned from the parsonage." "Gone to walk again, I presume; or perhaps in the garden, and Sybil went to the long glass door, which commanded a view of the garden, to look for him. He was there; and her first impulse was to open the door, and go out with him, but the second was a voice from the proud spirit, and turning, she said, " he is in the garden, I presume, he enjoys out of doors better than in, this beautiful night." "Call him, Sybil, I want him to read me a little piece from this paper; it is getting too dark for me to see it from here," said her grandfather. Sybil turned for an instant, with a pleading look to Aunt Mary; but Miss Rogers could not have understood it, if she Would, so Sybil went out and called Charles, as her grandfather had requested. Foolish child; as she approached him, she felt inclined to call him, for the first time in her life, Mr. Wallace; but she resisted the inclination, and said coldly - "Grandpapa wishes you in the parlor, if you are at liberty to go in." "Certainly," was his only answer; and they went in toge- ther." What a long and exciting evening that was to Sybil! How   CHESTNUT WOOD.          71 suddenly she passed from gay to grave; now bursting out into a merry laugh, much more like Mattie than like herself; and then again, with great effort controlling tears, which would rush unbidden to her eyes. Aunt Mary once or twice looked at her in a puzzled way; and even her grandfather raised himself in his easy chair, to have a better view of the "child." Charles was serious and anxious, and made no effort to con- ceal either, and all the party were evidently relieved, when it came the hour for breaking up, and retiring to their rooms. Sybil felt timid; she hardly dared have lMaggy leave her. She detained her by so many trifling little excuses, that the hour began to be late, before she was alone; and then, with a precaution which fear instigated, she locked her doors, and even her windows. And now, for the first time, doubts as to the prudence of the course she had pursued, began to suggest them- selves. She took out her note and read it over again, and as is often the case to an excited imagination, every line assumed a new, and different import. She read in the threats, danger to the life of all whom she knew and loved. Certainly her grandfather and Nep's had already been attempted, and no one, without gfreat and desperate motives, would have ventured thus far. She blamed herself for cowardice, for selfishness; she began to feel that she had forever sacrificed her self-respect, that she should have acted more promptly, more fearlessly. Was it yet too late? She rose and lifted her window curtain. The new moon shone with a dim and imperfect light. She could see the gar- den; she could see the fields and the woods beyond; but all looked ghastly and spectral. She had never been accustom- ed to being out alone, after dark; she could not as she looked back remember but once, and that was when as a child she fled for life, along those thoroughfares, leading from the great city. Sybil recalled all this vividly now, but it did not give her any  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7089-00000037"/> 72         CHESTNUT WOOD. additional courage. She covered her face with her hands, and before she was aware, words of prayer were falling from her lips. All earthly succor had been in vain; no living eye could watch over her - no arm could be outstretched to save her. But was there not One, who never forgot, nor forsook those who put their trust in Him? Soothed by this effort, she allow- ed herself no more time for fear; the hour was late, but there was a possibility that the person who had wished the interview might yet be waiting; at any rate she should feel easier to go and see. She tried to open her door noiselessly; but she had forgotten that she had locked it; surprised at the resistance it made, she, for one moment, felt inclined to allow it to deter her, but it was only for one, for her resolution was taken, and great, indeed, must be the reason, which could prompt her to change it. With a firm hand, and steady nerves, she turned the lock, and meeting no one, stole softly out through the garden door. The fresh night air struck a chill through her frame; she drew her shawl tightly about her, and glancing round, to make sure no one saw her, walked hastily in the direction of Dinah's cottage. With a keen, searching glance, she scanned the open road. Not a living thing was to be seen; the gaunt shadows of the trees lay stretched out upon her path; but they were motion- less, even the murmur of the night insect was hushed. The stillness was a relief to Sybil's stretched nerves; she became less fearful, and if her heart for a moment suddenly misgave her, she silenced it with the thought of the danger which she was warding off from those she loved. But when she found herself in the woods leading to the cottage, so still, so dark, she involuntarily trod softly, that no one might hear her - if there should be any one to hear. When she had passed about half through, and began to feel, that for that time, at least, she was safe, she heard the sound of quick feet coming after her. Palsied with fear, she leaned against a tree for sup- port. The sound came nearer and quicker. Instead of a mea-   CIESTNUT WOOD.          73 sured tread, it was sometimes a leap, and sometimes the dry leaves rustled as if they had been suddenly tost in the airi Sybil remembered nothing until her hand was touched, and a low growl of satisfaction announced the presence of Nep. Throwing her arms about his neck, she gave vent to her feel- ings in one long, loud burst of tears. Nep caressed and sootl- ed her. He was almost a human comforter. Sybil wondered, as she started again for the cottage, that she should have forgotten to bring him. She felt now so guarded, that before she was aware, her step became free and confident, and no one who was listening for her coming could have divin- ed the faint heart with which she had started upon her errand. One moment more of faltering as she approached the cottage; but Nep walked boldly by her side, and surely nor one could molest her. She stepped up to the door - Dinal never fastened it now - and softly opening it she was about to go in, when she remem- bered how much her sudden appearance would affright the old negro. Probably, also, whoever wished to see her would not incline to go within the house. Glancing around as she closed the door, she convinced her- self that no one was there, so she took a seat on the steps and waited to let the night develop what it might. Nep came and crouched at her feet, and there she sat, patient, calm, until one by one the stars glimmered out from the distant heaven, and the faint light of the day just lit up the dancing crest of the little waves of the pond which lay stretched out before her. All night! and what a long, long night it had been; how much during those hours she had thought and felt, how indel- ibly they left their marks upon her mind forever. When she rose to return home, she was faint and stiff. The cold night air had chilled her feverish body, and the darkness and stillness and fear had exhausted her strength. Her steps at first were VOT* I.         7 * 0  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7089-00000038"/> "        CHilESTNUT AVOOD. feeble and tottering, but the nearer she approachlled home, the more she felt the necessity of exertion; and when the house came at last in sight, she almost flew to gain its shelter. No one had heard her. She reached her room and threw herself upon her bed, too exhausted to think of undressing. It was well for her that she had almost mechanically lock- ed her door when she entered, for now when Maggy came to call, she could spring up and answer without admitting her. Maggy was usually not very keen sighted; but she loved Sybil, and there is no sharpener of the senses like a true, deep affection; so she would probably very soon have discovered that Sybil's night had not been spent'us usual. "The horses are at the door, and Mr. Charles again in wait- ing," Maggy said, shaking the door with some slight impa- tience at finding herself shut out from her mistress. "Sybil felt as if she could not go; but neither could she willingly disappoint Charles; so, after a moment's indecision, she opened the door, admitted Maggy, and with her assistance, proceeded to dress herself as quickly as she could for the ride. She looked very sad as she came down. Her appearance touched Charles. ITe helped her upon Rose's back, and for- got that there had ever been any cause of displeasure between them. It seenled to him as if her very voice had changed during the night, it had such an additional sweetness to its tones. Nev- er had he loved her so well; never had he felt how necessary her happiness was to his own. The ride gave her color and strength. Every kind, pleasant word of Charles was balm to her heart. As they rode along, the whole of the previous night seemed to her a troubled dream. She could hardly re- call an hour of it as a reality; and she had no fear that she should ever be subjected to the same thing again. There were many affectionate inquiries elicited by her worn looks at breakfast that morning; and they gave rise to a long   CIIESTNUT lVOOD,.         7 consultation between Mr. Atherton and Aunt Mary, the con- clusion of which was, that until Sybil should be very much better, they must not think of returning to the city. When Aunt Mary sought Sybil in her room, she found her soundly asleep; and sitting down beside her, she watched her with all the tenderness, and much of the affection, of a mother. IIow well it would have been for Sybil if she could have im- parted to her some of the trouble which was wearing upon her. A visit firom Mattie was the only eventof the day; and Mat- tie's first inquiry was:-- "Why Sybil, what makes you look so! are you sick?"  The color mounting in Sybil's face certainly, for a time at least, proved the'most satisfactory answer to the question. "There! you don't look very sick now. I only wish Mr. Langdon could see you," said Mattie; and as Charles's eye turned upon her, Sybil felt the color grow deeper. Vexed at herself and at Mattie, she said:-- "Mr. Langdon seems to be a favorite of yours - -at least you speak of him very often."  "And who, pray, is Mr. Langdon?" asked her grandfather, shutting his book and looking up with some surprise. "Mattie can tell you best, sir," said Sybil, quietly. The color now came into Mattie's face, but she said: H"He is a rich, young lawyer, that wears gold enough about him to buy up a small place like Hymeswold, and wears a love of a mustache." "And what is his business here?" "To enjoy life and scenery, he says." "To play the fool, I should think more likely, Mattie, from your description.  How did Sybil ever become acquainted with him?" "I am not acquainted with him, grandpapa," answered Syb- - iI; "I only met him at Mr. Rogers's donation visit."  - "So   your father knows hrn, Mattie?" V, 5?  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7089-00000039"/> 676(        CHEIIESTNUT WOOD. "Why, yes, sir, a little. He is one of' the parishioners - now, and goes regularly to church, as well as the weekly meet- ings." "A knave, then, as well as a fool. Sybil, I hope I shall hear no more of this man." '"You never would have heard at all of him from me, grand- papa; he is-no friend, or even acquaintance, of mine." A gleam of pleasure passed over Charles's face; and other eyes besides Sybil's were conscious of it. But it occasioned no remark. "This is very unfortunate," said Mattie, with an air of real perplexity, " for one of my objects in coming down this morn- ing was, according to Mr. Langdon's request, to ask leave for him to call here." "The impudent puppy," said Mr.. Atherton, warmly; " tell him to wait until he is invited; and that, I fancy, will be some time distant." No one ever dared to question a point which Mr. Atherton had once decided. So, although Mattie pouted, and seemed quite inclined to urge it, she did not. And it was well that she did not, for they had hardly ceased speaking upon the subject, when Mr. Langdon himself was seen driving his handsome cabriolet up the avenue leading to the house. Nep surveyed the coming carriage for a moment, then springing forward, gave him rather a noisy reception. "I Nep shows his taste," said Mr. Atherton; but as there is some fear that he may not make himself sufficiently under- stood, I will just step out and tell John the welcome the fellow is to receive." Even }Mattie could not help laughing at the extreme fear * which Mr. Langdon evinced as his horse stopped, and Nep stood, as it seemed, awaiting him. Tley heard his voice, in, the most coaxing tones, supplicating the dog ', to be quiet and go away;" and when he found all this was of no avail, calling 7      CHESTNUT WOOD. out to the boy in the stable, to come and take away " that brute." But either the boy did not incline to mind the man, or the dog the boy, for there Nep stood, barking or growling in no friendly manner.  Whether Mr. Langdon had some suspicion that fair eyes might be beholding his cowardice, or whether he trusted to the strength of' his whip, it would be difficult to say; but at last, he seemed to have made up his mind to alight, so he flourished the whip with quite an extra quantity of snaps, towards the dog, and stepped out upon the ground, Nep was now sure of his prey, beside being not a little infuriated by the crack of lash, so he made no hesitation to commence at once, a vigorous onset, and mischief would most certainly have occurred, had not John, who had also been looking out from the side windows of the front door made his appearance, and put an end to the affray. There was, however, something very ludicrously perturbed in Mr. Lanrdon's manner, as he inquired for " 3isa Thornton," nor did the short denial, which he received fieom John, add to his composure.  He seemed notwithstanding more inclined to debate, than to accede to the decision, and probably would have required a more strinrrent refusal, had not Nep sh owed a set of teeth, by no means yet beyond the power of doing onsiderable service. A simultaneous laugh followed his departure; even Mr. Atlerton  was more amused than vexed, at'the result of the attempt to call. Sybil's sense of the ridiculous was so keen, that it was not until he was fairly out of si ght, that she had any other feling connected wVithl this bold. attempt to see lher. Indeed she I ad 'fbr t he day quite comforted hlerself, with a belief that, after all, s. shae had made much more or the affair than there was any rea- son fr doing, and that, as no one was present to keep t he ap- p  ointment so strangely made, nothing had been intended beyond * t- R7Y  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7089-00000040"/> h7 8        CHESTNUT WOOD. frightening her. What could be the design of this, she could not divine; but there was too much of comfort in the thought for her, to care to subject it to a very strict test of reason; and now, this coming so boldly, she had no doubt to prosecute his object, trusting so implicitly to a power over her, which she could feel but not comprehend, awoke all her anxious fears, and long before the others were satisfied with what had seemed to them, a good joke, Sybil was quiet and sad. This change did not escape Charles's watchful eye. But he had been so fully satisfied with the indifference which Sybil had shown previously, that he could not find a place in his heart, for any anxious feel- ing now. Several quiet and peaceful days passed away. Mr. Langdon made no further attempt to see Sybil, and she was beginning to believe the past, in great part, the creation of an excited imag- ination. She began to ride, and walk, with Charles, with some of the freedom and pleasure of olden time; and once, when he had gone on business for her grandfather, to Hymeswold, ven- tured out to meet him, on Rose, without an attendant. When Charles found how much her health and spirits had gained, lhe ventured to propose again the visit to his mother, at Charlton. There was no trouble in gaining her renewed con- sent, and very little in convincing Aunt Mary, and through her, Mr. Atherton, to allow the visit. Miss Rogers was to accompany her, Jerry and Mattie were to stay at Chestnut Wood, fbr secur- ity from anxiety about Air. Atherton, and the visit was not to be extended beyond three days. All the little preliminaries were settled, and an early hour appointed fbr the start. Sybil seemed almost childishy happy at the prospect of seeing "Mam- ma Wallace " again, and Charles more than participated in her joy. The proposed ride seemed to roll back the few years, and they were, in truth, children again. The night before the morning on which they were to go, Sybil was in the garden busy in tending some of her favorite   CHESTNUT WOOD.          79 flowers, which she never left to any one else to care forb when she was near. It was one of those gray September twilights, which steal so quietly, and so noiselessly on, and she moved from one flower to another, the bright things seeming to create in them- selves enough of light to answer every needed purpose; when she heard her name, called in guarded accents:--- "Sybil Thornton! Sybil Thornton!" With a start she dropped the flowers she held in her hand, and looked around her. Very near her, but hidden from the sight of the house by thick shrubbery, she saw Mr. Langdon beckoning her to him. Mechanically she obeyed. "You have foiled me, for some time," he said, and she heard him grind his teeth, like an enraged animal. "But you cannot do it any longer; you have had your day, I must now have mine." Sybil gave an angry toss of the head, and was about reply- ing, when he interrupted her, by saying:- "3Biss Thornton, you can toss your head, and look angry, as mnuch as you please; but that will not help you. The plain state of the case is this: Your father, whom I suppose you know little, ,and care less for, is alive, and hereabouts, and what is more, is in trouble, and wants helps from his daughter." "It is an infamous falsehood," said Sybil, the temper lit- erally flashing from her eyes. , My father is not living, and if you do not take yourself away without an instant's delay, I will summon Nen." "It costs little to talk, Miss Thornton. Your father must b have known you, for all you do n't him; for he said you would n't believe me; and so, if the worst came to the worst, he told me to show you the ring; and to tell you it was the -ring with which he married your mother. You can see her name and the date of her marriage, if you wish to. Here it is!" and - : N . i.,         '  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7089-00000041"/> 80         CHESTNUT 'WOOD. he took out from his vest pocket a small package, and care- fully unrolling it, held the ring toward her. Sybil's countenance underwent various changes while lie weas speaking; but when she saw the small gold ring, held cautiously between his thumj -and finger, she gave an involuntary start forward, and tried to catch it in her cold and trembling hand. "Give it to me," she said, imperatively. "Of course not," he -answered very coolly; "I was only tol(d to show it to you." "It is not my mother's ring," said Sybil, turning slowly away. "I have no wish for it." "But I'swear to you, it is." "Then, let me see it." , Will you promise to return it?" "No, I will never return it." "Of course, then, you will never take it. Here is your mother's name," said he, holding it up, and examining it care- fully inside,-- and a date-the date of' the wedding, I suppose." "And what is it?" "Mary Atherton, Aug. 8." "Let me take it; it shall be given to you again." "Do you swear so, to me?" "No, I promise you." "Promises are easily broken." "So are oaths." "But you must swear." "But I shall not, and you will give me that ring. "( You are very obstinate, but I do n't see but you must have your own way; take the ring." Sybil's hand trembled so violently, as it touched it, that it nearly rolled upon the ground; but in a moment, recovering herself, she examined it closely, pressed it to her lips, and re- turned it.   CHESTNUT WOOD.          01 '; Are you satisfied?" "That that is my mother's wedding-ring? Yes." - "Do you believe that it came from your father?" "Yes; but not that he sent it to me by such a messenger." The small gray eyes, before her, twinkled with such an ex- pression of covert rage as she had never seen before; and she heard, again, that indiscribable noise of grinding teeth; but she stood silent, and now, perfectly fearless. "Sooner or later, you shall believe, Miss Thornton." Sybil's answer was a look of ineffable scorn. : ' Very well, look contemptuously as you please, now; but, sooner or later, my revenge will come;for the present I am satisfied in doing as I am bid. Your father bid me say to you, that he shall be at- the old oak tree, on the right hand of Dinah's cottage, to-morrow night, and that if you do not come to him, you will peril the life of your only remaining parent. You can do as you please, about being there; but sometime you must meet him; better now, and alone, than hereafter, before witnesses, who may be a little sharper-sighted than that old black woman.  Will you come, or not?" For a moment, Sybil faltered; but the gold ring,-her mother's wedding-ring, -her father's pledge to her, lay in Mr. Langdon's land. "Tell him," she said, ' I will be there; and remember, Mr. Langdon, I go to meet my father; if you de- ceive me, no earthly thing shall prevent my seeking justice." "And justice you shall have; but one caution, leave that dog at home; ride your horse, if you can contrive to get him out without attracting notice; and as you value your father's "he stopped, and seemed to hesitate, while he eyed Sybil, keenly.

"You have done your errand, - leave me to act my own discretion." *- "And a pretty discreet discretion it had better be; because hainging is no joke, - at least, so your father seems to think." Sybil impatiently pointed to the gap he had made in the hedge, and he almost mechanically, as if it were impossible for him to resist the look and gesture, obeyed. She watched him, until she saw him disappear through the hedge; then, without noticina the flowers which she had so suddenly dropped, re- traced her steps to the house. Hier mind and heart were in a tumult of painful emotions; so that she passed, without noticing, Charles, as he stood wait- ing for her in the parlor door. He was startled by her wild and altered appearance; but he did not dare to detain her, not even to call her name. When he heard the door of her cham- ber shut, he took his hat, and went out into the garden. With- out thought, he walked to the parterre. There lay the scattered flowers. He carefully picked them up. It was strange; Sybil was not apt to throw away the beautiful things. A print of a man's foot caught his eye. It was upon a bed of rare exotics; that was more singular still; but following it up, he found a succession of footprints across the beds, the nearest way to- wards a place which he now saw was broken in the hedge. Stepping through it he caught a glimpse in the distance of the retreating figure of Mr. Frederick Langdon. Prompted by he could never tell what, he followed slowly behind him to make sure that his suspicions were well founded. Goaded on he walked faster and faster, as he felt more and more assured that he was right; and soon he had overtaken and was by his side. "Mr. Langdon," he said, touching his hat with an air of cool politeness; " you walk fast to-day; pray, is your business of a very urgent nature?" ( Sufficiently so to secure me from any intrusion," was his isnmediate reply.   -  CHESTNUT WOOD.          83 "May I ask what it was? certainly, Mr. Atherton would prefer receiving his visitors some other way into his gardens than through his hedge." "Perhaps so; but I am no visitor to 3ir. Atherton; and all his family may not be quite as fastidious." Charles raised his cane, and poised it for a moment in the air, with a most intense desire to knock the fellow down; but lie manfully resisted it, and overcoming his passion as he best could, he said:--- "I understand you; but I believe every word you utter, : false." "Perhaps, young marl,"--and Mr. Langdon's tone was most provokingly cool, --" you say a little more than facts can sus- tain; you are at perfect liberty to ask Miss Thornton the truth of what I say; I am much mistaken in the girl if she de- nies it." "Denies what?" "That I came to the garden to meet her, on her own invitaw :i tion; and that she entertains for me feelings very different from what she does toward any other living being; not even, I -,-  am most happy to say, excepting yourself." "Fool and liar!" exclaimed Charles, now aiming the stick, with well directed force, and flourishing it very near the offend- er's head; " if you were little more of a gentleman, I certainly would cudgel you." "As you please; perhaps you might meet your match; but as there is Mr. Jerry Goldsmith coming, and he is noted for a man of peace; it might be as well to defer the battle until we are alone." "If I tell him where you have been, and what you say, he will not leave a whole bone in your body." ,   "But to that, Miss Thornton might possibly object.

If it should happen not to pleaset her, if she should be a little particular, you might come off second best." The easy assurance with which all this was said, had a greater effect upon Charles than the most convincing argu- ment. He muttered over to himself the words, " fool and liar," but showed no further wish to proceed to extreme measures, particularly as Jerry was now near them, and already calling out to Dobbin to " whoa." Never was horse more obedient. He came to a dead halt at precisely the right spot, and Jerry, with his usual nod, said: "I say for't, now! I should jest as soon have expected to see the parson and the cobbler together as you two. How in natur did it come about?" "Mr. Wallace can inform you," answered Mr. Langdon with an ill-concealed sneer. He certainly sought my company, not I, his." Charles made no reply, but jumping into the waggon, Jerry seemed instinctively to understand that something unpleasant had occurred, so whistling to Dobbin, they soon left Mr. Lang- don on the road. "Tell you what," said Jerry, when he saw t'lat Charles did not seem inclined to begin a conversation, k t alt ere chap is all shine, but all is not gold that glitters. He looks too much like a wolf in sheep's clothing to suit me. All those gim- cracks of his, ain't for nothing. I should like to see the title deeds to his great property. Tell you what, if the truth was known about the matter, I don'thelieve he has but one shirt to his back; he is all outside, like the whited sepulchre, the good book tells about, and I shouldn't be at all surprized, if he was full of dead men's bones, real skulls, and such sort of things. Lately I have felt such a desire to try a raw hide around his shoulders, and see how that would suit." Charles's cane played upon the bottom of the waggon as if it J   ',             CHESTNUT WOOD.          85 had not yet recovered from its propensity to do the same thing, t   but still he dared not trust himself to speak. "You are terrible angry, Mr. Charles; have you been mad at the feller? You look as if you could bite through a ten- penny nail." "- Don't worry me, Jerry, I am so angry, that my blood is boiling like the lava in the crater of Vesuvius, and very little will it take to make it run over. I feel as if I must use your raw hide over that back." - What has he done?" asked Jerry, drawing in Dobbin, and ::   offering Charles his horse whip. 4' You had better go and set- tle accounts with him at once. Nothing is so bad to keep as temper; It's like hop beer, the tighter you cork it down, the surer it is to bust." "Don't tempt me, Jerry; drive on. I must let him go this time; but if I ever catch him at the like a gain, I will settle ac- i  * counts with him the shortest way!" "Ready pay, and no trust," persisted Jerry, very unwil- lingly taking up his reins, :' he'll give you the slip; there ain't an honest thread in his whole body; and if you don't like to touch the fellow yourself, I am used to work, and will do it for you; only tell me what for, so I may pay on in good earnest." "No; let him go. One day he shall answer for it all; but not now; not at least, until I have permission." "'Permission, and pray who have you to ask? I thought you were a man grown, and learned enough to go to college." "Jerry, drive on, or I must walk; I am in a great. hurry to be back at Chestnut Wood." "Well now, you're curious, and things seem sort of snarled up to me; but it's easy enough to get you to the house, if that is all you want,' and Jerry was as good as his word; he    whistled, and Dobbin trotted until they came to the entrance VOL.

His suspicions were aroused, but for what, or about what, he could not distinctly define, therefore the whole of his mental state was the more unpleasant; nothing wears so much as un- certainty, especially upon the young ; but it is a discipline which sooner or later, all need to justly develop their character and Charles was, as yet, but in the bud.   ? CHAPTER V. SYBIL was in the parlor when Charles entered. The neces- sity not only of secrecy, but of extreme caution, was now in a measure explained to her, and she had already made her plans accordingly. She had no longer any doubt as to the existence of at least, one of her parents, and she intuitively felt; that in connection with his life, there must be a tale of guilt and misery. What this might be, she dared not think; she only allowed her- self to remember, that he was still a parent, and that to no earthly being was she bound by a closer tie. She should see him, she should hear from his own lips what had been his sin. She would reclaim him, and the gold ring which had been so associated with her mother's evil fortunes, should be to her, the signet of future success and happiness. A young girl's mind moves swiftly when fancy tips the wing of hope; and Sybil's lips were parted with a happy smile, at the bright pictures of parental love, which she was painting, when Charles's eyes first fell upon her. No words her lips could have spoken, would have sunken into his heart with such a pang, as did that bright smile. It left an impress there - wwhich even life's rudest touches, could never wholly efface. She saw the shadow pass over his face, but did not suspect the cause. :::? "Charles," she said, looking wistfully up, "I am sorry to disappoint you; but I am afraid I shall not be able to go to :, ;} / ,  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7089-00000045"/> 88         CHESTNUT WOOD. Charlton to-morrow. Can you not defer it, until the day after?  "Why? "Because - because," Sybil lead spoken carelessly, and was not prepared for this question, "because I cannot go." "Why, cannot?" "I have another engagement, which I cannot break." M May I ask with whom?" The color rushed into Sybil's face. s"I cannot tell you; and you must not ask." "Very well, do as you please; day after to-morrow, no, to- morrow; I must keep my engagement, and shall therefore go to Charlton.' An angry toss of Sybil's head was her only answer; no other words were exchanged between the young people that evening; and the next day when Sybil went to the breakfast table, she heard that Charles had left early in the mnorning. Mr. Atherton and Aunt M1ary expressed much surprise, but Sybil only said very quietly that she supposed Charles felt obliged to keep his engagement, for fear of disappointing his mother, and that she did not doubt he would return the next day. Aunt Mary's eyes wandered often to Sybil's face during that morning. There were two bright spots upon her cheeks, and a restlessness in her manner, which to her watchful eye, indicated great excitement. When they -were alone together, she made many affectionate inquiries, all of which Sybil answered with a mirthful word, which far from satisfied Aunt Mary. All day she kept Sybil in sight, and did her best to provide amusement and occupation for her; but nothing sufficed long. She seemed hardly conscious of the pains which were taken for her, and thanked Aunt Miary, when she remembered to do so at all, with a listless manner, which was very unlike herself. I-ow rapidly that day passed, It seemed hardly possible   CHESTNUT WOOD.          89 that daylight was fading away, and the twilight that was com- ing so rapidly on, was the precursor of night. She could hardly prevent herself from putting her hands upon her heart to hold it still; it seemed to her, to beat so loudly and tumultuously, that every one in the room must hear it. When she tried to speak, her voice became choked, and the iwords fell from her lips half uttered.. This would never do; some method must be devised for quieting her, and great was her relief, when Aunt Mary placed before her a book. Her eyes thanked her with such an earnest, grateful expression, that Aunt 3hary could hardly resist the inclination to put- her arms around her, and beg for that confidence which, until lately, she had never need- ed to request; but the red spots grew brighter upon her cheeks, and she wished rather to soothe than to agitate, so she sat watching the listless manner in which the leaves were turned over, and easily satisfied herself that Sybil's eyes alone were reading the words. Of her own accord, she insisted that Sybil should retire early; she would accompany her to her room, and see that she needed nothing, and was not sick. Sybil never could resist a gentle kindness; so she allowed herself to be persuaded to undress, and Aunt Mary did not leave her, until she feft assured she had the prospect of a quiet night and a happy to-morrow. Perhaps it was well for Sybil that her kind heart had been her guide, for she really rested body and mind two long hours, before she felt assured that the house was quiet. The last sound of Mrs. Giles's busy feet had ceased. Sybil's senses were quickened to an almost painful degree, and she heard her, as she went to and fro, now locking the front hall door, and then returning again, and still again, to make suro that it was fast. Trying every window in the lower part of the house, and slipping bolts back and forth, with sufficient  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7089-00000046"/> 90         CHESTNUT WOOD. noise to friighten away any one who might have dared to hope for an unlawful entrance. Then, there were the last words in the shrill tone of com- mand to Maggy, and Miaggy's drowsy answer, and at last a sound which startled her as it had never done before, her grand- father's heavy, measured step upon the stairs, as he went to his, room. 1No particular hour had been named for the interview; but Sybil was too impatient to wait longer than was necessary, so she arose, as soon as she became satisfied that no one would be moving again, and- dressed as noiselessly as she could. There was no feeling of guilt connected in her mind, with this secret interview, and it is very true that," conscience makes the greatest cowards of us all." Had Sybil thought it wrong to thus steal away from all protection, and expose herself to she knew not what dangers, she would have been timid and faltering. But now, not even a nerve waTs tremulous ; she looked, with eager haste, to her first interview with her only parent. She had not forgotten lM.'Langdon's injunction to secure Nep, and ride Rose. But how to avoid the one, and leave the other, was a matter of much difficulty. She knew that Nep could hear when every human ear would be deaf; and her past ex- perience, of his unexpected approach, when she was hastening to meet a former appointment, warned her to secure him before she ventured out. He always lay outside his master's door, and she must pass that door, unless she ventured through the room where Maaggy slept. There seemed to be no choice; with a light touch she opened the door. Maggy would not have wakened, if a whole army with music playing, had walked through. The soft footstep of Sybil no more reached her ear, than would have the rustling of a bird's wing. Sybil stood one moment, as she closed the outer door, buts no other sound was heard, save Maggy's long drawn breaths. To   CHESTNUT WOOD.           91 glide down the back stairs, open the back door, and move under the shadow of the out buildings, down towards the barn, occu- pied but a moment. Greppo, the stable watch dog, sprang to. ward the door, as it began to move; he had heard no sound, and was the more fierce 'for the surprise. But before he had time to utter a warning bark, Sybil gently called his name, and he came forward to welcome her. Rose, too, who was more ac- customed to the footstep, and the voice, neighed in a recognitory manner, and Sybil who had often visited her before, found no difficulty, for a full moon lighted even the stable, in going to her stall. ," Rose!" she said, throwing her arm loving around the pony's neck, "you must do me a great service to-night, but you nlust be quiet and gentle, and not make any more noise than is necessary. Gently, gently, Rose!" and the animal, who never submitted to be fastened in the stall, turned around, as she turn- ed, and followed her. It had been no uncommon thing for Sybil to stand by, while Jerry had saddled her' horse, and once he had shown her how to fasten the girths, so that if he was away and any one else should saddle fbr her, and not be sufficiently careful in tighten- ing them, she could remedy any mishap which might occur. Now to lift the saddle down from the high nails, upon which it was always hung, was, as she stood under it, and raised her hand toward it, quite impossible; she could only reach the stirrup, and Jerry never did his work half way, so it was firmly held. What was to be done; could she mount Rose's back without any saddle, and 'if she could, could she- ven- ture, should necessity require, to ride fast? now, fbr the first time, she remembered the bridle; that hung low, she took it 'down easily, and proceeded to put it on Rose's head. It must be confessed, that as much of a pet as Rose was, she was apt, like a great many others of her sex, to be not a little freakish, and self willed, and in no way did this develop itself oftener, ?%  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7089-00000047"/> 92         CIESTNUT WOOD. than when she came to having the bit placed in her mouth. It was an indignity against which her whole little fiery soul re- volted, and many a time had she and Jerry come to open con- flict on the subject, and the quarrel was seldom ended without her feeling that she too, was included in the general law-, which had gone forth of the necessity, sooner or later, for her sex to be in entire subjection to the lords of the creation. Poor Rose, she had the lesson to learn over and over again, but never fairly recognized it. To-night there was no such point to debate; she was only accommodating; it was lkind, and gentle, and sisterly, to open her mouth, and so she did, and herself, actually, more than Sybil, placed the bridle upon the head. Sybil had forgotten the strap under the head, that held it on, so Rose tossed her pretty neck as archly and as beauti- fully, as if she had been showingT off upon the lawn. Sybil remembered it, and feeling for it made it tight; but it took so long, and the difficulties were so far from being overcome, that she began to feel timid, and almost resolved to take Rose back to her stall, and go by herself on foot. As she attempted to unbuckle the bridle, Rose twitched away from her, and moved toward the door. "Oh Rose! Rose!" she called most piteously, " do not go!" Rose turned, and coming back, stopped under the saddle; a brilght idea occurred to Sybil, to spring upon her back, and lift down the saddle. "Light of limb," Jerry had always called her, and so she proved herself now. Thle saddle was quickly reached, and soon, firmly as the little fingers could draw the girth, fastened upon her back. But now Rose rather resented being led out by one of the back st-able doors. If it was not an indignity offered to herself, it certainly was to her mistress; so she plant- ed her four white feet with considerable show of resolution. ("Come, dear Rose," said Sybil's gentle voice; and whether they would or no, the white feet must move, and out the back   CIl ESTNUT WOOD.         93 door, too. Then, through the lane, where never before had such dainty steps been taken, and then by the large gate, Sybil mounted, and was away on her perilous adventure. Many misgivings passed quickly through her mind. Was it not most probable that she was deceived? What was there in the character of such a man as 3r. Langudon that ought to entitle him to the least credence? What was she venturing, and for what? But never once did she tighten her rein. Rose could not sympathize with one of her )young mistress's feelings of disquiet. The pony had a heart, but it beat only' to pleasurable emotions; and the brisk canter in the fresh night air, was a variety which partook very largely of the nature of a frolic. And right merrily she went, up hll and down, obey- ing the rein, and quite pleased that through it she could hlold so much communion with her companion. Down to the Pond the road was lonely, and Rose objected. She preferred the village, with its little white houses, and the chance which she might have of displaying both herself and her rider; but " gently, Rose," soon subdued her, and she went on as happily as before. Sybil had a feeling of safety ilr the fleetness of her pony,. whichl was a great relief to her. Twice she tried her speed, to make sure that it was subject to her control. Rose literal- ly flew, until Sybil, dizzy andc out of breath, checked her course. It seemed to Sybil, as she found she was coming near the cottage, that she had never passed so quickly over the road before; and she coaxed Rose to exclange her canter for a walk. Eagrerly she strained her eyesy in the direction of the tree; she is not mistaken; a dark form, with his arms crossed over ]is breast, is standing, leaning with his back against it. She saw at one glance, and that glance was one of Infinite relief, that it was not Mr. Langdon. Reassured bythe fact, and not wishing to seem reluctant to meet a father, she spoke to Rose, and they rapidly approached the spot. At the first sound of horses'  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7089-00000048"/> "        CHESTNUT WvOOD. feet, the manl had started and put himself into an attitude of defence. But Sybil had seen him, and been able to decide that he was not the person she most dreaded, therefore she came boldly on toward him. He quickly recognized her, and came forward to meet her. He was a tall, stalwart man; and Sybil saw in the bright moonrlight a face which seemed to her familiar, but only famil- iar as one seen in a dream, long, long ago; or as some pic- ture looked upon often in childhood, but never since, and now only half remembered. She stopped, and under that still night sky, with the soft rippling of' the lake alone to break the silence, met father and daughter. This was no time for words. They both knew each other by that strong instinct whichll never fails; and there they stood - that young, beautiful, guileless girl, and the man, not old in years, but in sin, and looked into each other's faces, but neither spoke. "Father," at length said the low, ringing voice of Sybil. ": My child," was the hoarse answer, " have you come at last!" ,' At last? Have you waited for me, my father?" "Waited for you! Yes; year after year-- ever since she died. I have longed for you, yearned for you, Sybil Thornton, as never father yearned for child before. And you have come at last - you or she, which is it?" "My mother, do you lmean?" :Hulsh, Sybil, hush! I never name her now. She died lonrg ago. And do you know, did she tell you, that I killed, her. Yes, shrink away, my child--lher child - I killed her. Ntot -with my hands, that would have been kind, merciful in me, but I broke her heart. Do you understand me," and he drop- ped his voice to a deep lwhisper, " your mother died because I was a brute. Now turn and go home. I have seen you --it is enouogh. I sent for you to demand money, for I am starv- ing, and must have it; but I want none of hers. Go back. Go   k;'; r^A       C1T HE TSUT OUOD .         95 home to your luxuries, and forget that your father has not here to lay his head." "Did she love you, my father?" "Love me! She loved me through sin and shame and guilt. She loved when I broke her heart, I tell you; and that is the greatest hell." "Then I will love you, too." A curse goes with my love. It is a blighted thing. You shall have none of it. Return to your home --but stop," and he seized her horse's rein with such force, that it almost brought the pony on her knees; " say, is he kind to you?" "He! who; my grandfather?" Your grandfather? So he is. He was her faheer I had forgotten it. 'Is he always kind?" "Always; too kind." "Curses on him'! he was not so to her. But for him now, all this wpuld not have been. Go! go!" he said impatiently; "I have seen you. Go quickly, I may be tempted yet. I am not always my own master. Go while there is time." "Father, I shall not go. Tell me, what can I do for you; I wait to hear." "Leave me! hate me! I richly deserve it. It is all I ask of you." "' And the only thing I will not grant. I will love you, and serve you for my dead mother's sake." Slowly the man loosened his hold upon Rose's bridle, and, without seeming conscious what he was doing, turned away and folded his arms across his breast. It was precisely the attitude in which Sybil had seen him as she approached; and as the pale moonlight fell upon his features, she sought eagerly in their 'l expression forr some look which memory would own. But t evNil the slight tenderness which had lighted them, like a stray beam of sunsline upon the bosom of a dark thunder cloud, had disappea red, and all was fixed, and stern, and relentless.

As she looked at him, she read the chance, and the first feeling of fear stole over her. It was brief; and before her father turned to speak to her again, she was in some measure prepared for what shie heard.' His very voice seemed changed as he said :- "I must have money. Do you hear ; money is whbat I wantlf Have you any with you?" Sybil's head dropped. There was something in this coarse and unhesitating demand, which stung her more deeply, than anything which had passed. It seemed so lost to every feel- ing of honor or manliness, that a keen sense of shame and de- gradation burnt into her soul; she hung Her head and made no reply. "Do you hear me?" he asked, catching her arm roughly, or are you like all other rich people, deaf to the cry of distress? I tell you, I want your money." "I have none here," faltered Sybil, the tears at the same time coming to her relief. "None! no, none to save your father from starving! A very obedient affectionate child. Sybil Thornton, I thank you. Go home!" He turned her horse's head in the direction of Chest- nut Wood; but the reins lay untouched upon Rose's neck, and she did not move forward. A heavy blow fell suddenly upon her; she reared, plunged, and Sybil being perfectly unprepared, was thrown with some violence upon the ground. She immediately attempted to re- gain her feet; but her long riding skirt was entangled about therm and she could not rise. A gentle hand raised her up, and she once more could hardly recognize the voice which asked " if she were hurt?" "Not in the least," she said, " but where is Rose? ' The sound of the retreating feet of the horse was heard, but she was already out of sight. VOL.

I must go; but all the money I have shall be yours. Where and when will you receive it. "Here, to-morrow night. Unless I am discovered to-night and prevented." "I will be here; if I am not, you may be sure that I could ' not come without betraying you." Betraying me! Ha! that would not be so pretty a piece of work; a daughter hanging her father! Do you realize it! If I am taken, I am hung! Nothing less; so take your choice.  Good-night."  No "good-night" fell from Sybil's lips. 'She shuddere, as her father turned away, and with long strides 'disappeared among the woods, leaving her alone; alone with the stars and the rippling lak-e. For a moment she felt inclined to recall him; she could not part from him thus; but even the dry crack- ling of the leaves under his feet soon ceased to be heard and she knew   there was now no power of recall. How cold and dead her heart felt within her, as she turned to go home, how little it mattered to her then, what could take place. The moonlight fell brightly upon her path: nature is not always sympathetic, for she smiled as gladly now upon that young head; as if the light of hope had not suddenly died out of her soul, but unconsciously, even to herself, it calmed and quieted her, for, as she walked on, erect and fearless, under its soft light, gentler and holier feelings arose within her, and she did not heed the solitary miles which lay between her and home. As   she emerged into the highway, she saw some dark ob- ject standing before her at a short distance in the road. To stop and retrace her steps was herfirst impulse; but she had  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7089-00000050"/> 98   .     c CHESTNU'-T WOOD. hardly turned, before she felt sure that she could not go back. She dreaded to meet her father; nor did she feel at all certain who else might be awaiting her in those woods. Let what might be between her and home, there she must certainly use every exertion, soon to be; and so with fear and tremb- ling she went softly toward the dark object. It was per- fectly still; either, she felt sure, not hearing her approach, or awaiting her, whichever it might be, she must go on. Sud- denly she stopped, and with almost a scream of joy called "Rose!" The pony turned and came toward her; throwing both arms around her neck, Sybil kissed her again and again, then lead- ing her to the fence mounted her back, and infinitely relieved, cantered quickly in the- direction of home'! Rose was again unwilling to go up the backl lane; she thought the exploits in which she had been a partaker, neither safe or pleasant, and her mood had lost all its gentleness, when Sybil, weary enough to have been spared the task, unsaddled and un- bridled her, and let her take her own way to the stall. The next morning Jerry had a great many inquiries and re- marks to make, as to how the saddle and bridle came hung so curiously, he being perfectly sure, it had never been his work. The stable boys were all called up; and to say the least, pretty soundly scolded, fbr what had happened, the more especially, as they denied any knowledge of the mattel. Jerry was absolute master in all the precincts of the stable, and being a faithful servant himself, required, and would have faithful service from those whom he employed; so, without attempting to find out, what seemed only to bring denial, and as he supposed, positive falsehood, he determined to watch pretty closely, so that nothing of the kind in future should escape him ; and if Sybil had not already learned that it was best to trust only to herself; she would have found that she must make Jerry a partaker in her night adventures. Fortunately for her, YVIIJ V JnCICUVI 1 sVI )'   "' ,          CaEST l'JT rWOOD,         99 she did not again wish to have Rose carry her, and the pony ca me quickly to the end of her frolicks. Sybil was so exhausted, when she reached her room, that she could hardly wait to undress, before falling to sleep. Magcgy noticed in the morning, the unwonted disorder of the room, and if every thing' her young mistress did, had not been most holy in her eyes, she would certainly have made comments' upon it; as it was, she contented herself with nicely arranging it, before she waked Sybil, and then forgot it. Rose stood waiting at the door; but Sybil did not wish her, and Jerry very reluctantly carried her back to the stable. He was a great lover of early rising and exercise, while the air was fresh, and cool. "He felt sure," he said, " nothing would ever bring the rose back into Sybil's cheeks, but a kiss from the rising sun," so, this morning, not being in very good humor with the stable boys, he grumbled audibly, and as Maggy said with a toss of her head, quite imitative of hei mistress. "Just as if the darlint had'nt a right to ride or not, without it being any of Jerry Goldsmith's business, that he need go a scolding about. People called him a likely, good-natured fel- low; but for her part, she never saw such a meddling, good for nothing man in all her life; no, nor she hoped she never should see his match." "Ah, but indeed, Maggy dear," answered Jerry, imitating perfectly her Irish brogue, " and sure its my match, you'll never be for wishing to see, bating its any one beside yourself." "The hall door slammed to with some violence; but it was the only answer Jerry received. That day, Chariles Wallace did not, as all had anticipated, re- turn to Chestnut Wood; but a little note came to Mr. Atherton, from him, saping that his mother felt unwilling to have him leave  home, his vacation was so rapidly passing away; and, therefore, he-should probably not meet them .again, for a year, at least.   &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7089-00000051"/> 1 00        CHLEsT'NUT WOOD. There were manlly kinld messages for Aunt 3lary, but no re- membrance of Sybil. It was an omission which, thlough all noticed, no one ventured to comment upon; and the result of reading the note was a determination, renewedly expressed on Mr. Atherton's part, to break up as quickly as possible, and return to their city home. To their surprise, no one seemed so desirous to have this quickly brought about, as Sybil; she was even so unreasonable as to beg, with an earnestness quite unu- sual to her, that they might leave on the following day. "Next week was the shortest time in which it was possible," Aunt Mary said, " to make the required arrangements." There- fore, the next Monday was the appointed day; and the bustle of' preparation immediately began. It was a great relief to Sybil; for it gave her an excuse to be everywhere, and about everything, and to conceal her rest- lessness and excitability. Her grandfather watched her closely. This -was a new de- velopment of her character, which he could not understand, and he did not like the nervous tendency which it indicated. With his usual clear-sightedness, he saw some recent cause must have occasioned it; and he was, therefore, much more oc- cupied in attempting to divine what it might be, than in draw- ing up the directions by which Jerry was to regulate his business during his absence. Sybil did not allow herself to be left alone with him even for a moment; perhaps, it was the consciousness that she had something which she wished to con- ceal, that made her avoid him; perhaps, it was that secret in- telligence which, so often without a word or look, having passed to inform us, yet makes clearly known to us the fact that we are objects of attention, and, perhaps, suspicion. Sybil was to ride to the parsonage to inform Mattie of their decision. Such was Miss Rogers's proposition, and Sybil-felt that she could assign no reason for objecting; so Rose was again brought to the door, and Nep stood ready to accompany   CHESTNUT W00OD. - 101 them. The road to the village had been a fated one, and Sybil looked across the fields, wishing some path lay in that direction. The boy, who held the horse, could not tell her; he thought there would be too many bars for a lady to encounter; but Jerry must be asked, and Jerry being too far away to be easily found, there was no resource but to go by the old road. Sybil felt, she had come to that time in her life, when timidity must no longer be a part of her nature; and yet, she could not but confess to herself, that she grew, daily, more and more afraid. The rustling of a leaf in the brisk September air; the sudden roll of a stone from under her pony's feet; the sound of coming w wheels; or the distant call of the farmer to his horses, who. were carrying home the heavy harvest loads, filled her with :-as fear. It was pitiable to see that young thing so shaken; but l she had had little rest, and much excitement, and the future ;  looked so darkly and gloomily to her that it seemed as if on, so long as her frail life should last,- she could never again know the feeling of security; and what appeared most singular to -:? her, every tvpe and form of fear was, in some way, eonnected with the face and figure of Mr.,Frederick Langdon.  So, as she reached the parsonage and saw him leaving the gate, she felt as if the evil spirit, she so much dreaded, had indeed crossed her path.  She could turn away, and stop before Miss my Fitch's door, and, without a moment's thought, she found herself there. Miss Palm y was sitting at the open window, with quite a  number of little chills creeping over her thn flames which she most obstinately refused to notice. The last er ings of summer! how she clng to them; nothing so dreadful as that long, cold, dreary winter; that necessity for urning wood and libghs; that insinuation, so daily spoken, that ler summer, too, was spent; that the long day was past and tile long night comning t on.. Poor creature, there could dawn no rPing fior her; no season of fresh-budding hopes; no green leaves upon the dry and withered' stock. So, to-d y, len ,of            9 a  t'. *..  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC7089-00000052"/> 102        CHESTNUT WOOD. every other person in the village was sitting by the gentle warmth of a few blazing sticks, this sensitive woman, who needed it more than all, sat sewing, and strove, by indifference, to forget that she was chilled and stiffened by the autumn wind. For many long years she had not seen life and youth without a pang; and when the beautiful vision -of Sybil and the little dancing pony came between her and the nearly barren tree, that stood sentinel beside her front gate, it was, for an instant, almost as if a mortal hand had struck upon her heart; but it was only for an instant; Sybil's voice called pleasantly to her. It was rich and soft enough, to have loosened a -more charmed spell than that which held Palmy still; so she came out of the door, looking like more of a human being than she really was, and dropped one of those little courtesies, which were, in olden time, the very pink of courtesy; not knowing as she did so, that, by this very act, she revealed that most secret of all the secrets of that locked up heart --how long ago it was since her manners had been formed. She did not think of it, neither' did Sybil, as she slid off Rose's back, and came in to say (" goodbye." What a contrast between the two. Palmy saw and felt it all. Sybil thought and knew no more of it than the beautiful wild flower of some unsightly barren spot, upon which nature's hand has dropped it to bloom. Palmy nervously continued her sewing. 'The vest upon which she was workings was too gaudy to be mistaken; no one but Mr. Langdon was ever known to wear a similar one; and as this conclusion was passing through Sybil's mind, she heard the gate close, and looking up, saw that person himself entering the yard. Her first impulse was to retreat through the back door ; but Miss Palmy's expression of astonishment at her sud- den start in that direction, recalled her to a sense of propriety, and she stood waiting for the knock upon the door to be an- swered, before she could make her escape.   - '?          CHESTNUT WOOD.          103 "You are in haste, Miss Thornton," he said, extending his ;!  hand to detain her, as she attempted to pass him; "I had two - objects in- stopping at Miss Fitch's now; one was, to see about my vest, and the other, to see you." Sybil drew herself back, and fixed her large eyes upon him with such an expression of hauteur, that, in spite of his efforts to conceal it, Mr. Langdon was obviously embarrassed. "You can have no business with me, sir," she said; "I tvill ,;: thank you to let me pass." W "With Miss Fitch's leave, not at present," said he, stepping back, turning the lock, and taking the key out of the outer door. "Now, Miss Thornton, I have some few things which I must say to you; and if Miss Fitch will let us have the use of this room, by ourselves, for a few moments, I will see- that she is well paid." 3JitW Palmy stood looking from one to the others with an expres- sion as ludicrous as it was earnest, but did not move. "Miss- Fitch," continued Mr. Langdon, taking from   his pocket a silver dollar, and endeavoring to force it into Palmy's cold, motionless hand," you will oblige both Miss Thornbtn and myself by leaving us alone for a few moments." "Miss Fitch will do no such thing," said Sybil. moving toward the door; , nor will Mr. Langdon dare dgtain me." '  " A"We shall see. Miss Fitch, if you do not go of yourself, - and are neither to be begged or bought, I shall have to hurry -' your decision in a manner quite as unpleasant to me as to your- self:"  So saying, he seized with nervous haste, her arm, and dlrew her toward the kitchen door. Palmy, on finding herself thus forcibly led, uttered a little f: tintt scream, which had the effect of' wakening her from her : stupor, and with a  sudden twitch she endeavored to free her- self'; but no, the gripe upon her arm only grew tighter and stronger; and in spite of all her efforts she found herself actu-  ally witlin the precincts of the kitchen, and her own  parlor 1%?  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7089-00000053"/> 104         CHESTNUT WOO. door shut upon her. She shook herself, as if to be assured of' her personal identity, and finding she was still in propria personae Palmy Fitch, she marched with the air of an enraged animal, toward the door. It also was fastened, and Palmy knew the strength of the bolt well enough to be assured, not very slilghtly. She gave one knock upon it, and the blow from her sharp knuckles was never obliterated; but the door was still fast shut. The wood of course did not receive all the' force with which she struck, and the tingling of her hand did more toward recall- ing her to the use of her reason, than perhaps any less acute thing could have done. To' go out through the back door, in through the little window of her bedroom, and from there into the parlor; it was no sooner thought of, than attempted. True, Palmy fobund more difficulty in climbing that window, than she had the last time she had done so, full fifteen years ago; but where there is a will there is a way, and for Palmy's will, fairly roused, there very seldom failed to follow the way. She slipped back once or twice, in a very inconvenient and uncomfortable manner, but at last succeeded, and with a mortified feeling, not very new to her, moved softly toward the door: A sudden grasp of the latch assured her that too was fast; and she heard, or what was just as bad, fhncied she heard, a low laugh, proceeding from the parlor. This enraged her beyond any power of her own to control, and she was about giving another blow, which would have been equally futile wraith the first,- when her attention was arrested by the loud and angry tone in which Sybil was speaking. "This behavior is as unaccountable as it is surprising, Mr. Langdon. I insist upon your immediately unlocking these doors, or I will go to the window, and call-fbr help." * "As you please; you will probably then attract quite as much notoriety to the thing as may be either pleasant or safe ; perhaps it would be as well, looking at the matter all around, to remain still, and- hear what I have to say."   X.:i ^CHESTNUT WOOD. -105 It was too true Sybil had felt the full force of' it, as soon as she had uttered her threat, and now stood motionless, without an effort to answer. Miss- Palmy lost all desire to go into the room, if the door had been thrown wide open, and she invited to come, and a con- dition of her entrance had been, that the conversation should cease, she would most unhesitatingly have chosen to remain where she was. She put her ear close to what a minute before had been a very obnoxious key hole, and assumed an attitude of profound attention. I dare say, she heard Mr. Langcdon say, that old fool finds she can't get in, and is eavesdropping somewhere; it is as well to prevent any such thing." A noise on the other side of the key hole, made her spring away, with sufficient force to betray her, and she heard again, the same laugh, which had so much irritated her. ' When she dared approach again, no. words could be distinguished, though she heard the sound of Mr. Langdon's voice, speaking very earnestly, and occasionally Sybil's in reply. It seemed to her, as if they were becoming more quiet, and she was meditating going back into the kitchen, the same way in which she had come from there, when she heard a light tap on her bedroom door; the contents of the key hole were removed, and- she heard Sybil saying:- Miss Fitch! I I cannot unlock any of these doors, but I beg you will go immediately to some of your neighbors, and take me1Cans to set me at liberty." Not a word in reply from Miss Palmy; she had a feeling of personal grievance in having Sybil locked in the room with a young man, while she was locked out, and so she seated herself upon the side of her bed, and looked from the window, as in- differently as if she did not hear. "Miss Fitch!" said Sybil again, 4"I know that you are with- in this room, why do you not answer me. I can assure you I  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7089-00000054"/> 106        CHESTNUT. WOOD. am wholly innocent of your being locked out from your par- lor." Still no reply. Sybil's temper was evidently beginning to rise, for shaking the door with more force than it seemed as if those delicate hands could use, she said:- "Miss Fitch! I demand an answer. Are you willing to as- sist me, or are you not?" She might as well have expected an answer from the bed post, for Palmy sat as rigid and immovable as the one against which she leaned; not a sound escaped her lips. "Very well, I shall not forget your kindness, Miss Palmy, neither will my grandfather or Jerry Goldsmith. I must hence- forth regard you as an aider and abettor of Mr. Langdon, in his nefarious purposes, and as such, shall certainly report you." There was a slight noise from the bedroom, and Sybil was beginning to hope she had succeeded, when Mr. Langdon de- stroyed all the prospect by saying: - "Miss Fitch will .have too good an eye to her own interest to do any such thing; for as truly as she gives one call from her window, I will break this large mirror into a thousand shivers." The mirror was " the noted apple of Miss Palmy's eye," the only piece of extravagance, of which she had ever been guilty, and in her estimation, worth more than all the other good things of which her house could boast. Peril to her good name, the danger of offending Mr. Athcrton, and particularly Jerry, were nothing in comparison to the dread of any disaster happening to that, so she sat down again immovable against the bed post, and sat still, and the conversa- tion recommenced again in the parlor. Mr. Langdon had forgot- ten or had not noticed that Sybil had removed the filling from the key hole, so Palmy heard all that was said. "Well, Miss Thornton! you did not gain much. It perhaps will occur to you in time, that you may as well submit quietly to what you cannot avoid. You will find it with this proposition,   I       .;!;I CHESTNUT WOOD.        107 as you have with my others, sooner or later, you must come to them. There is no way open before you, but to yield a ready, and pleasant consent, to what if you do not, will be. forced upon you." "( Wretch!" said the quivering lips of Sybil. Miss Palmy fancied she could see how she looked, as she said it. "Well, wretch! don't sound as prettily as some softer name. I had rather you would call me Freddy, or Fred, or any that you might fancy; it would be rather more appropriate to my wishes. However, there is no use to sit fretting about it. I have told you very plainly what I hope, and what I mean to have done, if you choose to do so willingly, it is very well; if not, you know I have the power to compel you." "I will die first." "Dying is not quite so easy; if it were, a great many would prefer it to other things which they are nevertheless compelled to do. You go to the city to-morrow; you are at perfect liberty to do so. I am not obliged to remain here; in fact my purposes can be better carried out with you there, than here. The event is certain." He must have approached Sybil, for Palmy heard her say, "Remove your hand, and prevent me if you dare," and the next instant, Sybil flew down the gravel walk, sprang upon Rose's back, and was gone. Palmy saw that she had at last, regardless of whatever consequences might ensue, leaped from the open parlor window, by which she had been sitting, before Mr. Langdon could prevent her. "( She is as spry as a cat," was her first mental ejaculation, as she compared her own entrance with Sybil's manner of leaving the house. "But after all, it ain't very civil to leave me alone in the house with such a strange man. What can all this mean?" She had no time to continue her reflections, for she heard the lock of the outer door turn, and looking out, saw Mr. Langdon departing with the half mended, and not paid for, red vest, upon his arm. She was still a prisoner in her bedroom;   &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7089-00000055"/> 198         CHESTNUT WOOD. and no way was left, but to crawl again, through the window1 or to wait for Jerry to return and release her, as he best might. She did not hesitate long; looking more carefully around than she had before, to be sure no one saw her, she found it much easier against the common law of events, to get out, than to get in, and no one happening to be near, she went around unseen, and was once more in possession of her parlor. To her delight, she found the keys which had been removed from the locks, thrown upon the table, and when Jerry returned to tea, not a trace of either visitor was to be seen, not even the turf which Rose in her impatience had torn up from the bank before the gate. Palmy's keen eye had discovered it, and put all to rights. Jerry would certainly never suspect, and when, as she threatened to do; Sybil should inform him, Palmy felt sure she had a sufficient reason to assign for all she had done, so impatiently, and in a great flutter, she saw Jerry come and leave again, to finish his work. As he was shutting the door, she could not resist an inclina- tion to follow him out, and ask " how late he should be gone." Nor was she at all comforted when he told her he should find so much to do in assisting the family from Chestnut Wood, that he probably should not return until quite late. After he had gone some distance he recalled, with no very pleasurable feeling, her sour face, and the expressive " hey I " with which she generally denoted her disapprobation. She had a keen, quick way of uttering it, which reminded one of the angry snarl of a dog. Jerry always felt inclined to call her "poor fellow," after hearing it, but, fortunately for himself, never did. He had, however, to-night too much to do to trouble over even more expressive marks of displeasure; so he was soon whist- ling away, as happily as if the sunshine were not all within himself. He was to call at the parsonage for Sybil - such was Miss Rogers's last direction when he came home to tea - and he liad stopped to ask Sybil to wait for him. It seemed   :;:  '  "       CHaESTNUT WOOD.         1 09 very opportune to Sybil; nor could she refrain from expressing her joy in terms which both amused and perplexed Jerry, and even attracted the observation and comment of Mrs. Rogers. "Sybil is so glad to go back to the city," she said, "that she has seemed quite strange ever since she came. I should think she would love the country better than Mattie; but of the two, Mattie is now the most unwilling to go away." "Perhaps that ere fellow with the mustaches and the gold chains has got something to do with it," said Jerry. "Folks tell me he has done a power of visiting here of late, for all he ain't got much of the minister's cut about him." A merry laugh broke from Mattie. A great beau he is of mine, in truth; for all he thinks of, or talks to me about, is Miss Thornton. He asks all kinds of curious questions about her; such as: '- Do I know how much money she will have? Are there no other relations who could, if she displeased her grandfather by marrying, or any such folly, step in and take her place? Is she very set in her ways; or can you, by hook or by crook, get around her?" "Mattie, I am ashamed of you," said Sybil, interrupting her, with a kindling eye. "I do not think you either witty or kind." "For shame," echoed her motlher, trying to suppress the smile which would come; "a young girl like you should know what she is talking about, and not make sport of serious sub- jects. For all you know, Mr. Langdon's attentions may mean something." "The very remark I was making, mother, that I have no manner of doubt he does mean something. He certainly talks something, at least to me. I was only complaining that Sybil, because she has the money and the beauty, should have all the beaux." "Who beside Mr. Langdon?" asked Jerry, with a knowing wink.   &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7089-00000056"/> "O         CHESTNUT WOOD. "Charles Wallace, as sure as my name is Mattie Rogers." "Mattie, will you stop?" asked Sybil in a voice of such earnest entreaty, that it was impossible to resist it; and Mattie's eye fell beneath the clear eye which looked beseechingly into hers. For a moment the color came and went in her face, while the struggle between pride and affection went on in her heart. But affection was natural to it as its pulsation, and throwing her arms around Sybil's neck, she entreated her for- giveness with as-much earnestness as if she had indeed been guilty of a crime. "Now, my dear, how exactly that is like you," was Mr. Rog- ers's comment, as he looked over his spectacles from the paper he held in his hand to the scene before him; " always running into mischief, and always kissing or crying yourself out." "I never cry, father," said Mattie, with a sudden pout of her red lip. "No; but it would be as well for you, perhaps, if you did. Repentance is one of the states of the mind very properly con- sidered by theologians antecedent to salvation ; and it is, there- fore, one which it would be very delightful to me to see my daughter possess." "Begin where we will, father, you must always end in the- ology. If I were mother, I would have you labelled ' A Treat- ise on Original Sin, Native Depravity,' or some such thing, and placed on one of the empty shelves in your library. Would n't he fill up a good long space, mother?" The eyes oi both mother and daughter were dancing with fun. One glance at them assured Mr. Rogers that, as was very frequently the case, theology was for the present at least, quite out of the question. So he forbore any further com- ments. Sybil and Jerry took their leave, and the conversation which followed was probably of a much more worldly nature.   ' : X? " *-t  n    CHAPTER VI. Faoi the interview which had taken place between Sybil and Mr. Langdon at Palmy Fitch's, Sybil had derived one piece of information, which was of much importance to her. It was the knowledge of a certain "business call," which Mr. Langdon said her father had received, taking him away to a distant part of the country for a short time. He had sent a request, that any money which she should have to spare should be forwarded to him through Mr. Langdon, who would call for it, as he had averred, at Chestnut Wood on that evening. Sybil had laid before him the folly of attempting to do so; but he had many purposes to serve, and insisted upon it, and upon her preparing for him a cordial reception from her grandfather. "Also, I suppose, from Nep," was Sybil's reply to this; and fortunately for her she had suggested the only thing of which he was really afraid, and which could have induced him to allow any other method of communication between them, nor could all Sybil's ingenuity for a time devise any which seemed feasi- ble. At last it occurred to her that the money left on a cor- ner of the mantelpiece ire old Dinah's cottage would be safe, and from there Mr. Langdon could take it any time he pleased. To this he raised many objections, but a cold, dignified answer was all that he received in reply. Dinah must therefore be visited that night, and Jerry, busy as he was, persuaded to go with her. This was no very diffi- cult task. Jerry could not have refused, if he had spent all  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7089-00000057"/> "2        CHESTNUT WOODo the remainder of tie night, making amends for lost time; so  having carefully enveloped the money, of which she had, not- withstanding the late donation party, quite a little sum; she 2 wrote a few words denoting the amount sent, and a promise to ,  save for him, all that she should receive in the future, and with  a lighter heart than she had felt for some time, started with  : Jerry for the cottage. "La now, Miss Sybil," called Jerry, after he had been en- deavoring for a full half mile in vain, to keep Dobbin near Rose's side. You ride like mad to-night. You seem more  like yourself, half and half again, than I have known you this,  long time. Are you .really glad that you are going away to  : town?"                          .  "Yes, and no; both, Jerry. If I could stay here - without --I mean, if'I could feel easy and happy, just as I did when .: I was a little girl, I should love Chestnut Wood better than any : place in all the wide world; but I feel afraid here all the-  time."                  -  "Afraid, Miss Sybil," and Jerry opened his eyes very wide with astonishment, "I should jest like to know what it is scares you." "Scares me! I don't know; I don't think I am frighten-  ed, but it seems lonely, and I love to have people always about me." "There is Nep han't nothing else to do; and Rose, she han't got nothing else to do; I don't see who else you want." "No one; I certainly ought to be contented, especially as I cannot carry Rose to the city with me." "There is Charles Wallace," continued Jerry, "lie, to be sure, can talk better than either Rose or Nep; but you ain't  no great talker, so I suppose that don't much matter. And  that makes me remember- I never seed anybody go off in  such a huff as Charles did. I saw him going with his carpet- bag swinging on his arm, and when I called arter him he mnadelr    CHESTNUT WOOD.         1 1 is if lie didn't hear me, but I wan't to be done to that way, I put in voice enough to bust a drum, training day, and ie halted." "Charles," says I, as I came up, i what has got into you?" 'I am going home," he answered, as sulkily as a whipt log. "Well, I should think if your marm kept a dairy, she would ose all her milk this time. He looked at me kind of hard, but le didn't ask me nothing, though; I knew he hadn't heard bout turning the milk sour, and was wondering what I meant; lowever, if he was too proud to ask, I was a lot too proud to ell." Here Jerry stopped and began to whistle with most com- nendable vigor. Sybil waited for him to go on with his story; but as lhe howed no inclination to, but began a new tune, as soon as he lad ended an old, she ventured to ask:- "Did he tell you, Jerry, why he returned home so sud- lenly?" "He! who you talking on, Miss Sybil." "Why Charles Wallace, to be sure. Did he say why he eft?" "So we were talking about Charley; I say for't, I got so rusy whistling, I like to have forgot all about it.

"Does lie though?" and Jerry's good-natured mouth ex- panded from ear to ear; "then, perhaps he'll tell you this; and I sort of think you would rather hear it from him than from me." Sybil caulght the glance of Jerry's eye; it was very roguish, and she forbore any further questions, though she wondered nuch what he could imean. Perhaps she would not have for- given the look, but Dinah's cottage was in sight, and she had a delicate task there to perform. Jerry said, " he had business down in the woods a little distance, and would attend to it quickly and return." Sybil was glad; she liked to be alone with the old negro. There was no sight pleasanter to her than the look of joy, which always greeted her; no words sweeter than those tremulous with age and weakness, which always wel- comed her. "Bless the sweet angel - the beautiful golden-haired child! light of old Dinah's eyes! sweetest bird that ever makes music for her old ears." Such, and many other fond expressions, the negro was wont to utter, when no other person was present; and Sybil treasured them all up. Old Dinah seemed so unusually glad to see her to-night, that Sybil could not find it in her heart to tell her, she had come for a farewell visit; so she read and chatted with her until Jerry'S whistle warned her of his return; so then she said, gathering courage, as the honest, trusting eyes of old- Dinah were fast- enled full upon her:- "Aunty! (such was the loving cognomen with which she generally addressed the negro), I am going to do a strange thing, and I do not want you ever to tell any one, or ask me a word about it. I am going to put this little paper with money in it, under this bright brass candlestick upon your mantel-piece; and soon a man will come in and ask you for it; and I wish you to tell him where it is. See here, Aunty1iglit here,-- this one toward the closet, do you understand me?"   CHESTNUT WOOD.          15 "Yes, Missis!" "And will you do what I ask?" "Yes, Missis!" Not the-least expression of wonder or astonishment was vis- ible on the old negro's face. She would not have questioned ,anything Sybil asked, had it been, even, the removal to the dreaded work-house. "And here," continued Sybil, putting a gold piece into the negro's hand, "here is something to buy little comforts for your- self; when I am gone." The money rolled from her hand upon the floor. "Going! going! 'Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day'- night and day -prayers, night lland day," she muttered almost inaudibly, "a widow and desolate" - "Trusteth in God," added Sybil, gently. "Trusteth in God," repeated the old negro, " prayers night and dlay, a widow and desolate." "iNow, Mrs. Lovejoy!" said Jerry, who had entered almost unnoticed by Dinah; " that are ain't jest like you, it has an unthankful kind of a sound. It was n't this yellow-boy lying here upon the floor, that made you come to that conclusion aboult being a widder, and a desolate, too; was it, now?"

CHESTNUT WOOD.01). talking to you; but I kind of guess now, talking to Miss Sybil hIere, would n't be an interruption, would it?" A ray of affection shot fi'om those dim eyes into the bright, laughing face of Sybil. It went warm to her heart, and for many a long day she did not forget it. It was a pleasant memory to carry away from the cottage,--for now, the place was haunted by many mournful and troubled associatioins; and Sybil had too little that was glad, to willingly part with the merest trifle. As she cantered slowly home, she almost felt that she had taken leave of some great trouble; that the business for which she had come into the country was finished, and she was now ready to reSume. in her city home, the occupations and pleasures of young life. Her face was bright and laughing when old Di- nah looked into'it; she was happy; happy, in having acted the part of a good daughter; happy, in having done all she could to aid the wants of an only remaining parent; and happy, too, in the belief, that the mystery and uncertainty which had clouded so long a portion of her life, had come to an end. Sybil had hardly left the cottage before Mr. Langdon en- tered. It would almost have seemed as if he must have been secreted somewhere near, watching fbr her, and only been de- terred from meeting her there, by the presence of Jerry. Old Dinah had not yet recovered from the excitement into whichl the visit had thrown her, and was still almost unconsciously re- peating the same verse, when the door was opened, without any notice being given, and Mr. Langdon came in. Dinah had never seen him before, though he had been so often about the cottage watching for Sybil, that he had become quite fahmilial with her appearance. "How I are you, old nig,er," he said, dropping into a chair "Tlhere is not any body here besides yourself; I suppose, i, there?"   :;:}[,i         CHESTrNUT WOOD.         i17 Dinah continued lmuttering the verse. "Can't tell what you are saying; old womanr; cant you speak a little plainer so I can -understand you? There is not nobody else here, besides that dry husk of yours, is there?" "Widow and desolate," repeated Dinah, a little more dis- tinctly. "Widow? you were not ever married, now, old black skin, were you?" "Sixth of June, with prayer night and day - night and day." "A merry wedding you must have had, pray how did Caesar like it?" "Pomp, not Cesar, Casar was my brudder- a widow and desolate. ' "The old fool has lost her mind, or she would'nt keep up such an everlasting mumbling. Can you answer one question straight- Has there anything been left here for me, by Miss Sybil Thornton?" "An angel in that heavenly home, and 'there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain, for the former things shall have passed away.'"' "Woman!" said Mr. Langdon, growing vexed at what he began to consider intentional trifling, "are you, or are you not going to answer me a straight question?" Dinah's under jaw dropped, and she looked at him with that mute, supplicating look, so peculiar to helpless age. Don't be a playing the fool any longer, I have had enough of it, and am getting mad; so you had better say out pretty soon. Where is the bundle Miss Thornton left me?" "Miss Thornton?"   Dinah had neve r heard her called so, since the bright being first first flitted across her pathway. Sybil, or any one of the pet names, which were so liberally bestowed upon her, would have recalled the whole transaction instantly, but "Miss Thopnton," and the strange face and figure, the rough tone and rougher manner of the man before her, as ef-  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7089-00000060"/> "        CHESTNUT WOOD. fectually obliterated it all as if it had never taken place, and the expression of her face became every instant more and more tention, but'all in vain; when he drew any sound from her it was only the indistinct muttering of the last verse upon which her mind had fastened. Enraged at last, beyond all self control, it occurred to him that the idiotic appearance of the old nearo was entirely as- sumed, r the purpose of concealing and appropriating to her- self the money which had been entrusted to her; so going to her, he seized her arm with no gentle grasp , and shook her vio- lently. "Desolate," was the only word she uttered as she reeled to and fro under his powerful hold. "-Tell me, answer, where is the money?" almost screamed the angry man. "Widow and desolate," was her only reply. W ith nervous haste his hand approahed her throat, and through the cottage resounded the grincling of teeth. One moment more. and the span of old Dinah's life would have been filled out, but so per- fect and utter bad become the confusion of her mind, that she made no sound; she was as helpless in his hand as agyoung child. "Perhaps it was this very helplessness, this want of offering the slightest resistance, which saved her life. Perhaps it was the ever watching hand of Him who never forsakes those that ut their trust in Him. Certain it is that when no hand was near to save, no voice that could be raised to plead for the old nervo the hand of the lawless, abandoned man, was stayed, and dropped as suddenly and as powerless by his side as if it had been struck by a bolt from heaven. A terrible oath, such as never had profaned that little prayer filled cottage before, passed his ips, and he ground his teeth in impotent rage.  CHESTNU'T  WOOD.        L "No thanks to me," he growled as he moved away from old Dinah, and commenced the search of the house, " that you are not murdered. I don't know what saved your life." Every- thing was ransacked, and even the little treasures which had escaped the cupidity of old Moll, were appropriated by Mr. Langdon. Still no where could the money be found, and as a last possibility it occurred to his mind that Sybil might have failed in her promise. Dinah followed him with her expressionless eye, never mo- ving, never making the least effort to stop him, equally un- concerned whether he threw over the contents of her neatly arranged drawers, or emptied the old trunk, containing Pomp's clothes, upon the floor. It was rather singular that during all which had taken place, she had held tightly the gold -piece which Sybil had picked up from the floor after she had drop- ped it, and put again in her hand. Had Mr. Langdon seen this, probably her doom would have been sealed. "I have almost a mind to go up to Chestnut Wood," he said, speaking to himself, but aloud, "I can go through the garden and get at that girl in some way. At any rate this is a chance which I can't lose, for getting at her in the city will not be so easy, although I tried to make her think it was." "sNow, old nigger," said he, approaching her, and holding his double fist close in her face, " one thing you may set down for certain; the very first time you tell one word about what has -happened here, that very time I will come and cut your tongue out. Do you hear?" and he gave her another rough shake to insure her attention. Not a sign of life but a deep drawn sigh came from old Di- nah; the frighlt and the violent motion had almost deprived her of the life which had just been so providentially spared. "The fool wont remember it, that is lucky for me," hle said, turning and leaving the house, "neither will she ever have an idea what has become of these silver spoons."  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7089-00000061"/> l-[ CCHESTNUT'I     WOOD- Dinah sat a long time in the positionll in which he had left her, and when consciousness began slowly to return, it was en- tirely unaccompanied by any recollection of the last visitor. Never, to the day of her death, could she recall it, or account in any way for the confusion in which she found her house, or the disappearance of her few and very dear teaspoons. Mr. Langdon, after leaving the cottage, walked by a some- what circuitous path to Chestnut Wood, and sought the place which he had made in the hedge, by which to enter the garden, but he could not have expected to find this had he been a lit- tle better acquainted with Jerry, for it was hardly an hour after Charles had passed through it in search of the person who had entered, and been talking with Sybil, before Jerry's watchful eye had discovered and restored it to its former condition. He had made many inquiries to ascertain who could have been guilty of such-an outrage, and had even gone so far as to men- tion it to Mr. Atherton. Therefore Mr. Langdon, after look- ing for it for some time in vain, had made a new entrance nearer the house, but still sufficiently fatr to avoid attracting Nep's observation, should an unlucky noise follow the separa- tion of the dry twigs. A bright light was burning in Sybil's room. Mr. Langdon had no difficulty in making himself sure that it was hers, for the curtain was raised and her light figure passed many times before it. Once she approached the window, and leaning her arm upon the casement looked out. The night was perfect; the moon bright and cloudless, as on the previous evening, and in the garden each little shrub and flower lay as clearly pencilled upon the broad, hard walk, as if painted there by fairy fingers. Sybil could see them all from her window, and once looking upon them, could not tear herself away. Mr. Langdon stood in the garden, near the window, behind a large cluster of flow- ering almonds; he could easily have spoken had the sash been raised, but he dared not call loud enough now to be heard, for   CHESTNUT WOO1.         121 fear of attracting the notice of others, particularly of Nep, and of no human being did he stad in so much dread. For a full 'half hour he stood looking up at Sybil, while she all uncon- scious of his presence, was taking farewell of the beautiful garden, she was so soon to leave. In the mean time the lights which when he approached had been scattered all over the house, were put out, and the only one which was now visible was the one burning in Sybil's room. Having cautiously taken this survey, he stepped out for an instant upon the walk, which lay directly in front of Sybil's window, and raised his hand. She saw him, for she started I  and instantly dropped her curtain. "She will come again," he said to himself, and resumed his place behind the almond bush. In a few minutes the curtain was carefully raised, the light put out, and Sybil stood looking down into the garden. Again Mr. Langdon stepped out and boldly beckoned her to raise the window ; but Sybil was motionless. Mr. Langdon immediately had recourse to an experiment which did not fail. Putting his hands behind him he took off a ring and adroitly dropped it into his vest pocket, then coming almost under the window, he took it from his pocket and held it up between his thumb and finger in the bright moonlight. It glittered for an instant in the ray, but at that instant it had told its tale. The window was cautiously raised and Sybil asked in a low voice, but so clear and ringing that it might have been heard at a much greater distance, what he wished. "I wish that Miss Thornton should keep her promise," an- swered Langdon. "And in what respect have I failed to do so?" "You have not left money for your father at the cottage." "Have you been there?" "Yes, and found nothing but an idiotic old negro, whom I had half a mind to murder." g i  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7089-00000062"/> 122        CHEISTNUT WOOD. The danger to which she had so unwittingly exposed old DiL 'nah suddenly flashed across Sybil's mind and kept her silent. "You know I told you, Sybil Thornton," continued Langdon, after having waited in vain a few minutes for her answer, "4 that you could not escape me. I must have that money if I enter your house and take it from you. Your father is not a man to be trifled with, even if I could be." "Mr Langdon," said Sybil, leaning out of the window and speaking with much distinctness, " this way of holding conver- sation is unsafe for both of us. I will come into the garden; be kind enough to go to the summer-house near the library window, I will be there in an instant." Mr. Langdon heard the window close without giving him time for an answer, and stealing around with much trepidation, on account of its increased nearness to the dog, into the summer- house, he awaited Sybil's coming, patiently for the first ten min- utes, but impatiently enough, and with much grinding of teeth and half uttered profanity during the two hours through which he persevered in remaining. At the end of this time he stole out again through the hedge, and with the feelings of a foiled animal retraced his steps to the village. When Sybil had closed'the window, it had been with the full intention of going immediately to the summer-house as she had proposed, but as she opened Maggy's door, the girl, who had not yet been asleep, rose in her bed, and in a very noisy and voluble manner expressed her surprise at the unusual visit from her young mistress. Sybil asked for matches and a light, and by the time Maggy had stumbled about to procure these for her, she had come to the conclusion that she must re- turn to her room and attempt to go out without awakening Nep. With many doubts she put her foot softly upon the thick carpet. It gave back no sound. Sle had approached her grandfather's door and was just opposite Nep, when it suddenly opened, and her grandfather stood before her. ,   CILES'TNUT WOL ).        123 "Sybil's first impulse was to fly back to her own room, but Mr. Atherton's hand arrested her. "Where are you going, Sybil?" he- said kindly. Sybil trembled visibly, hung down her head, and did not an- swer. Her grandfather raised the light he held in his hand so as to gain a full view of her face, then after looking at her a mo- ment in silence said:' "Sybil Thornton, return to your room." Sybil went quickly back. Throwing herself down in a chair ,he covered her face with both her hands and wept bitterly. The last evil that could befall her had now come. Her grand- father's suspicion and displeasure were aroused; what more of unhappiness could remain? She forgot all about Langdon awaiting her in the summer- house; she forgot the strange miscarriage of the money intend- ed for her father; she could only remember how unhappy she was; how singularly her life had been haunted by some evil genius! Poor young thing! she had not that entire submis- sion to that Power which directs for us all, even the smallest events of life. There was something crushing to her in the accumulating troubles. She did not take them to herself as means of daily growth. She had yet to learn that no character can be strong and self-sustaining unless tried in the crucible of affliction. Discipline! it seems strange how essential an ele- ment it is of spiritual growth; how puny and dwarfish we become if the genial dews descend and the sun always shines. Sybil was exposed to the two most opposite influences. One, the in- dulgence of every wish expressed or unexpressed, and the al- most unshared affection of those with whom she lived; the oth- er, secret trials which none who loved hler could know, and which all the finer and better feelings of her nature compelled her not to avoid. She was, therefore, in a measure put out of the reach of the common influences which mould character, and  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7089-00000063"/> 121 2CII,:STIUT WOOD. must be independent of them. To-night, as she sat all alone in that silent chamber, could a mother's voice but have spoken, could any one she loved have whispered to her that each event should bring out for her a great work if she received it aright, much of the timid, trembling child would have been lost in the faith and hope of the immortal soul. But she sat alone, timid and trembling, not daring to look forward into life, not daring to look back; and so, with her head leaning upon the table, she at last fell asleep, and Maggy awakened her on the next morning, pale and weary, unfitted for the bustle of leaving and the ride to the city, and just in the condition to confirm any suspicions of her which her grandfather might entertain. He was not at breakfast. He had risen early and ridden to a distant part of his farm, leaving orders that if he should not return in season, the family under Jerry's care, should pro- ceed to the city, where he would join them, if not before night, certainly by the next day. At the hour appointed for starting, as he had not arriv'ed, the family took leave of Chestnut Wood, and Sybil saw the house and grounds fade away in the distance with less regret than a few days before it would have seemed possible. They must stop at the parsonage for Mattie; and as she stood with her bright eyes and glowing cheeks upon the steps awaiting them, Aunt Mary and Sybil both thought she had grown in beauty since her few months' sojourn in the countrr. Though apparently waiting for them she seemed now in no special Shurry to enter the carriage. She made several little errands back into the house, kissed her mother goodbye until even she was surprised at the unwonted show of affection. But the cause of the delay was at length explained. Mvir. Lang- don was seen by others now as well as by Mattie approaching the house with much haste. His small person and swinging gait had in it something very ludicrous to Mattie's fun loving eyes, and ghe began to grow   X             CHESTNUT WOOD.         15 red from suppressed laughter, as Sybil to turn pale from fear, as he came nearer. Miss Rogers glanced uneasily at them both. Diminutive as the man was mentally and physically, fbr some reason he had acquired an importance in the eyes of both of her young pupils which she could neitherunderstand or explain; and she felt glad that by going to the city they should be removed from his society. In a more authoritative tone than she was accustomed to use, she told Mattie to take her seat in the carriage," and said to Jerry that " there was no necessity fbr any longer delay." Mr. Langdon had gone around to speak to Sybil, but just as he had opened his lips Jerry snapped his whip, and the spirited horses sprang forward with a speed which elicited a faint scream from Mrs. Rogers, and an involuntary oath from Mr. Langdon, which oath did not fail to reach the ear of the worthy minister, and in a moment it oblit- erated the whole impression made by the never ceasing attend- ance of the stranger upon his weekly religious meetings. Such an opportunity of doing good rarely occurred, and was imme- diately seized and made the subject of the next Sabbath morn- ing's discourse. A rambling sort of a performance the minis- tcr necessarily made of it, for he was divided between his de- sire to rebuke hypocrisy and profiaity; so he ended as persons are very apt to do when they attempt too much, by accomplish- ing nothing; and Mr. Langdon went away from church without its once occurring to him that he had in any way fallen under the displeasure of the very good, but very prosy Mr. Rogers. "'  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7089-00000064"/> CHAPTER VI. MR. ATHERTON, on the night of Mr. Langdon's last visit to Chestnut Wood, had not retired immediately after putting out his light, but attracted by the beauty of the evening, had sta- tioned himself. at his window, to watch the moonlight, as it lay so beautifully shadowed upon the broad gravelled walk of the garden. It was something unusual, for the enjoying of the moon, and star light, lay now for him, only among his memories; per- haps it was the feeling that he was about to leave all, that made him linger there so long at first; but soon, he saw the figure of a man, stealing up from the lower part of the garden, saw him station himself behind the shrub, then come o ut, and beckon to Sybil, at her window. He had no thoughts that she was there, or in any way con- nected with the sudden appearance of the man; but to his sur- prise, he heard her open her window, then watched the immediate retirement of Mr. Langdon, to the summer house. He deter- mined to go out, and see what it might all mean, and had opened his door for that purpose, when he met Sybil, coming softly from her room, into the hall. His first words to her were kindly spoken. The whole affliir was to him so sudden, that he had no time to indulge any but those feelings which were most ;: -natural, and it was not until after watching for a moment the changing color of her face, that he connected her in any way with guilt. He had once been only too trusting, he must be forgivi- now, if his suspicions had been even more easily aroused. , \   *'!;*!!         CHESTNUT WOOD.          127 As Sybil closed her door, he stood doubting whether to follow her to her room, and demand from her there, a full and entire confession of what had occurred, or to go down into the summer house, and demand an explanation there; but he determined at last, to do neither, but to go back to his room, examine carefully all he could gather from memory which could, have any bearing upon the subject, and come to his own conclusion without trust- ing to any other person. His mind settled upon this, as. the only probable explanation. Charles Wallace had left the house suddenly, and without any sufficient reason being given. Both of the children had ceased to be children any longer, and what more natural than that the affection which they had for so many years felt for each other, should grow and ripen with their growth. There was much in the manly, honor loving boy, that had attracted and at- tached Mr. Atherton, and should he come to at all fulfil the promise of the child, there could be no one to whose care he would sooner confide his darling grandchild. All this he had thought of frequently during Charles's last visit, and had been pleased with the awkward, but decided way in which both of the young people so clearly showed their preference for each other's society. He had also a suspicion, that some slight lover's quarrel, which the high spirited young man would not fbrgive, had caused Charles's sudden departure; but if so, why  did he return, and in this clandestine manner. The longer he thought of the subject, the less serious a matter did it become, and at last, he came to the determination to ride over before returning to New York, to Charlton, and investigate it in as far as he should be able, without appearing too much interested, or to attach too much importance to it. Young people must take their own way. He approved of what would in all probability be the result of the matter, and if they chose to quarrel and make it up on a beautiful moonlight night in the summer house in his garden, he should not interfere.  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7089-00000065"/> 128        CHESTNUT WOOD. although he should much prefer a more open, and more straight forward way of proceeding. With this conclusion, he rose early, and mounting his horse, hoped to be able to attend to such home affairs, as yet remained to be settled, ride to Charlton, and reach New York on the same day; but he found more to occupy him than he had expected, and it was some time after dinner, before lie stopped at the little inn in Charlton. He recalled very distinctly the first time of his visiting there, but no shadow from then, lay over his path now ; it was all, he thought, in the past. Mrs. Wallace and Charles were sitting alone in their little parlor, when Mr. Atherton knocked at the door, and Mrs. Wallace's astonishment was almost as voluble as Mrs. Rogers's would have been, when she saw their unexpected guest. Charles's thought was, that some evil must have befallen some one of the family at Chestnut Wood, and this his first question indicated. "What has happened, sir? who is sick?" "Well, Charles, that is quite a reception to give me, when I have ridden thirty miles to see you. Must there necessarily any thing very particular happen, to make me take Charlton, on my way to New York?" "I beg your pardon, sir; but it was so unexpected for me to se6 you, I hardly knew what I said. Are Miss Rogers. and Sybil well?" "Perfectly so, when I saw them last, which was last evening, or rather I should say last night, for I saw Sybil quite late-at night." Saying this, Mr. Atherton fixed his eye keenly upon Charles, and Charles, unable to understand the look, felt his color come, and his eye fall. Conversation followed on indifferent subjects. Mrs. Wallace, like a great many other women, had always difficulty in over- coming an early prejudice, and although Mr. Atherton was far less stern and grave than usual, she never for an instant forgot l                      \    CHESTNUT WOOD.          129 who was sitting beside her. She became like herself, only when talking of Sybil, and the disappointment she expressed at not seeing her at the time when she had so certainly expected her, was as sincere as it was hearty. "And you left us so suddenly for home, because you anticl- pated your mother's disappointment, did you, Charles?" asked Mr. Atherton, again fixing his eyes fully upon him. "Partly for that, and partly for another reason," answered Charles, again coloring deeply. "A And may I ask for that other reason." "I should not like to tell you, sir." "Some very foolish thing, I am sure, Mr. Atherton," inter- rupted Mrs. Wallace, a little alarmed at her son's boldness. "( Boys will take freaks into their heads, and Charles is full of them about Chestnut Wood. He would talk for an hour at a time about Sybil, before this visit, and now, though I have asked him every question I could conjure up, nothing can I make him say, but yes, and no." "I am sure, mother," said Charles, looking painfully em- barrassed, "you must have asked me when I was busy about something else." 'Perhaps I did," said his mother, divided between the wish not to displease Mr. Atherton, or add to the evident embarrass- nent of her son ;" but ever since his return he has been absent minded, and not at all like himself. He went away yesterday, and did not return until just before you came in, and I really felt quite troubled about him, but his father said he was not fit to be sent to college, if we could not trust him to go about by himself in vacation, without feeling that we must know every where he went, just as we used to when he was a little boy." "He seems to be quite a runaway; we shall both of us have to advertise him," said Mr. Atherton, now perfectly convinced that his suspicions were right; " but if he will take one piece of advice from me, it will be, that whatever he does is done  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7089-00000066"/> :133X)       CHESTNUT WOO.00 openly, without the slightest attempt at concealment. There is nothing a noble mind despises, like trying to bring about an ob- ject by secret and clandestine means. Artifice oftenest defeats itself.  Charles did not utter one word of self vindication; he felt wronged and almost insulted by Mr. Atherton's tone and manner. Something he saw, had displeased. him, something had excited suspicions against himself; but he felt so sure of his own perfect innocence, that he had no wish to offer one word in defence, but sat lookingo down, while he knew Mr. Atherton was carefully scanning every change of his face. And he knew too, that his face beli'ed him, and that he was deepening whatever impression might already have been made against him. Mrs. Wallace saw that something had gone wrong, and became extremely uneasy; but every effort she made to make matters better, seemed only to make them worse, and suddenly it occurred to her, that if she should leave them alone together, she should do the best thing she could. Making a very awkward excuse, she hastily. gathered up part of her work, strewing the articles ll the way along upon the floor, until she reached the kitchen, where she began, almost without being conscious what she was doing, to sew violently, accomplishing in a few minutes, as she afterwards noticed, more than she did usually, in a much longer time. Charles, now that he felt no longer any care of what his mother might say, or do, became at once call, and self com- posed, and Mr. Atherton, in spite of his suspicions, could not but recognize the same noble spirited young man. Almost be- fore he was aware of it, he dropped the tone of reproof, which he had so naturally assumed, and found himself quite as much to his own surprise, as to Charles's delight, speaking in the old way, of future hopes and plans. {i     He made many arrangements for the profitable use of the AI!   college vacations, and while they should remain in the city, pro- 4'   2z           CHESTNUT WOOD.           131  v :- posed that instead of returning to the quiet country life of Charlton, Charles should come to him, and avail himself of whatever advantages the city could afford. Charles had seldom a wish of his own, in opposition to Mr. Atherton; but now, he felt more than usually willing to allow him to direct in all the smaller matters -of his life. Anything, that would draw him near Sybil; any way, by which his future might be connected with hers. Mrs. Wallace began to sew with less rapidity, as she heard Charles's voice assume its natural tone; and when Mr. Ather- ton rose to go, she went in and urged his stay with as much warmth as if nothing unpleasant had occurred. But he must reach New York that night, or his family would feel anxious about him; so Charles walked by his side for some distance on his way, and said "good-bye" with unaltered affection and respect. Mr. Atherton was never more puzzled in his life. He had certainly abundant grounds for suspecting that Charles had made a visit to Clhestnut Wood on the night previous, and that the visit was clandestine; but he saw no reason to suspect that his motive in doing so was other than that natural desire for privacy with which all young people wish to cover the deeper, and tenderer feelings of their heart. He regretted, but could not attach any great blame to him in the- matter. He hoped, however, by preserving an open and indulgent course himself, to remove from both Sybil and Charles any necessity, and therefore, any desire for concealment. Still, after they parted, and were each pursuing their respective ways alone, they could tot refrain from going over the past interview with very anx- ious thoughts; Mr. Atherton, because he was puzzled and an- noyed by his want- of power of comprehending the action; and Charles, because, though conscious of being under suspicion, he could not in any way divine, for what. Once, the thought flashed across his mind that, perhaps, Mr. Atherton might have &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7089-00000067"/> I32        CHESTNUT WOOD become aware of the differences which had taken place between himself and Sybil; but what were those differences, and for what? He asked himself, again and again,'and could find no sufficient answer; so he concluded that, in some way equally difficult to explain, Mr. Langdon had injured him in Mr. Ather- ton's estimation. The more he thought of this, the stronger grew his persuasion of' its truth; and before night he had de- termined that but one way lay open before him. It was to return to Chestnut Wood, see Mr. Langdon, and demand of him a full explanation of what had taken place. His mother could not understand'his wish to go, and did everything consistent with her power as a very- indulgent mother, to prevent it; but Charles was just in the state of mind to have the slightest obstacle only increase the desire: so, without waiting for any conveyance, as he had become quite accustomed to the walk, he was soon on his way toward Chest- nut Wood. He tried to bring all the circumstances of his visit there, to bear upon, the object for which he was going now; but the nearer he approached Hymeswold, the more desultory and evasive became the grounds upon which he had determined to make his charges; so, by the time the steeple of Mr. Rog- ers's little church came fairly in sight, he had begun to feel as if he were on a fool's errand. Mr. Langdon could not know that Mr. Atherton had been at Charlton, and of course, not that he felt otherwise than most friendly toward him. Should he go, and himself tell him of it, might he not be putting it into the power of an enemy to do him much harm? Wavering and uncertain, now urged on by an indistinct but wounded feeling,--sure, in some way he had been wronged; I    and now, withheld by every motive of discretion and good sense, his very gait became an index of his state of mind, and he was weary and heart-sick when he came opposite the   X'?*:i3'          CHESTNUT WOOD.         1' 3 "Rising Sun,"- certainly, in no mood to meet and cope with one as artful and wily as Frederick Langdon. He entered the tavern, and was immediately recognized and welcomed by the landlord, who, with the easy familiarity of an American inn-keeper, considered himself hardly so much the paid host, as the gentleman receiving his guest. Any kind word was welcome to Charles, and he really felt grateful for the nice warm supper, and cheerful fire, which he bespoke before announcing his errand. He almost hoped, as he sat there alone, listening to the crackling of the wood, and watching the forked flame as it curled up and around the capa- cious chimney, that some luck would bring Mr. Langdon in the room, without his making a formal matter of inquiring for him. He could then insist upon knowing what he meant, by what he had said about his own intercourse with Sybil, and adroitly draw from him the result of any interview he might have had with Mr. Atherton. Suddenly, the door opened, and, as if conscious of his wishes, Mr. Langdon entered; but cer- tainly, he had not known of Charles's presence, for he started back, and uttered his customary oath. "Swearing seems to be a common mode of reception, on your part, Mr. Langdon," said Charles, rising; "certainly not the most civil one in the world; but between you and I, I do not know as it matters; we shall not be likely to waste any too much politeness between us." "I do not know why you should wish to begin to pick a quarrel so soon with me, Mr. Wallace. I see nothing either of us can gain by so doing; and I have always made it a rule, never to quarrel unless I could accomplish something by it." "Perhaps you may not; but I certainly should not trouble myself to speak to you at all, unless I expected to gain much. The last time I saw you, you uttered some aspersions against a friend of mine, which I should be well pleased to have you retract." "You mean Miss Sybil Thornton, I suppose. Well, I don't VOL. II.         12  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7089-00000068"/> treasure up all I say about her; but certainly, I have the right to speak of her as I please, and you will not with my consent, and I am happy to say with hers either; interfere." The blood and the temper rushed together into Charles's face. He had resolved to be very cool, and command his feel- ings quietly; but he had not prepared himself for the easy self- assurance with which Mr. Langdon would treat him. He was not proof against the cold and careless, yet familiar way in which he made use of Sybil's name. "I believe you to be a consummate liar and villain," he al- most choked out. "That, you have once before politely informed me. Per- haps, one day Sybil may call upon you to sustain your charges." '"Which I can most fully do; and what is more, can, without waiting for that very improbable time to come, make you con- fess the same yourself:" An unrestrained sneer was his only answer; and it was, per- haps, the best one he could have received, to give him a realizing sense of what was necessary in order to deal success- fully with the man before him. "Well," he said, recovering : his temper, and speaking slowly and in a subdued tone; -"I hlave no wish or intention of standing here wrangling with you, in so ungentlemanly a manner. If' you can convince me that you really have any claim upon Miss Thornton's time or thoulght, you shall meet with no opposition from me." "Why do you come here to ask me these questions? why do you not rather ask them of Sybil herself?" "Because I feel that it would be insulting her in the highest degree." "Why," said Mr. Langdon, springing from his chair, and ap- proaching Charles, while the temper flashed like fire from his eyes; " why insulting to her? you have used that language to me sufficiently; I now demands in my turn, an explanation?    I - -.... .  .V       13,. Anld I readily grant it to you, because you are a low, con- temptible villain; because you are no more fitted to be named in i  connection with her, than with the purest angel above ; because in my heart I firmly believe, that by some secret machinations, you have acquired an influence over her, which has changed her, which leaves her only a shadow of what she once was. That you are a blight, a mildew, a curse to her, and that in some way alike mysterious and unknown to me, you will work out for her positive injury, as well as unhappiness. Are you answered?" A low, grinding noise was heard, and Charles looked around to see if' any animal had strayed into the room; but there was no one present but Mr. Langdon and himself. Satisfied? Yes, perfectly; more than satisfied; and in nrc turn, I will say to you, that I have power over Sybil Thornton; power of which no earthly being can ever deprive me; power which I intend to use to the full extent, even to making her my wife. Are you satisfied now?" "You shall never do this, while I live; you shall have no power over her; and the very first time you pollute her ear with one word of marriage shall be the last hour of your life! ' i  "And pray, how do yott intend to prevent thist? A young m an who can talk so largely, certainly should I have some grounds to believe he can accomplish what he asserts." "Persevere and see." "I shall persevere; but you will not be near to see; Sybil herself will be the last one to complain; the last one to permit any interference. Good-morning, sir!" With a quick, nervous step, Mr. Langdon bowed himself out  of the room, and Charles had the satisfaction of feelin, that h1 klne as little, and had accomplished as little, as if' he had re- mained at Charlton. He was entirely foiled; and that, too, we ith such a want of tact and good sense on his own part, that he felt Mr. Langdon had possessed decidedly the advantage over him. He had no heart to remain any longer, or to make to make  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7089-00000069"/> 136        CHESTNUT WOOD. another call in Hymeswold, so without waiting sutflicien long to become rested he started for home, and a long, lone solitary walk he had. Every mile was crowded with l pleasant thoughts, with gloomy forebodings. Nothing in t fhture looked brightly to him. His ambitious hopes and wis es all died away with the thought, that perhaps there might no one for whom to excel, no eye to gladden at his success no heart to be made happy by his victorious conflict with di culties. Suddenly the light of the young man's life seemed lhave gone out, and the " darkness was so deep as to be fel] It was unfortunate for him, for a happy heartis the best aid a complete education; and with him the feelings had more th usual effect upon the mind. His mother hardly recognized her son in the morose a discontented man that returned that day; nor did he assui to her his natural character throughout the whole of the va( tion that remained ; and when he left to return to colle she sent many anxious thoughts after him. Her heart w bound up in his success. He was her first born, her " sumn child," and well she might have been both proud and fond -him, and well it would have been for him, if thus young in 1 he had been content with the priceless treasure of a mothe love. He returned to college, but another and more imports change had taken place. The previous year he had grow physically, but now his heart had leaped over the long li of years, and he already loved and suffered with the maturi of manhood.         X When Mr. Atherton reached tee city he was not questione nor did he choose to say, where he had been. Sybil had n seen him since he had sent her to her room, when she Im him suddenly in the hall, but she was seldom so long sepal ted from him, and when she heard his voice in the house, sl ran down to meet him, forgetting for the time the event, n -\   CHESTNUT WOOD. was there anything in his reception to remind her of it. He was gentle and affectionate, and had hardly been an hour at home before he began to devise various plans for their amuse- ment and instruction. He did not intend to give them time to be homesick; he knew that with the young there is no great- er insurer of happiness, than constant occupation, and he had beside a strong conviction of the necessity of making the most of a life, short, and as he believed, so soon coming to a final end. It was wonderful, that with his view of things, he should have thought it worth living, and perhaps he would not, could he have been allowed the choice.  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7089-00000070"/> CHtAPTER VII. To RESUME the same routine of studies and pleasures, re- quired some exertion for Sybil and Mattie, after a summer's fiee recreation in the country; but by degrees they became in- terested in their new employments, and when the winter, with its cold and changing climate, had fairly set in, they were ma- king the same rapid advances which had so pleased Mr. Athe* erton and aunt Mary, during the first six months of their city life. To Mattie, New York presented many attractions. She began to love it far better than her country home, and to think with a species of' dread which she hardly dare confess even to herself, of the little quiet parsonage and the demure village people. Her mother's- highest ambition had been, that she should be able to play Ascension. How badly would sloe have felt, if she could have seen Mattie's lip curling with scorn, as she read in her letters the pleasure she was anticipating, and have heard the half sneer with which she said to aunt Mary: "Mother seems to have forgotten that she ever lived in- a place larger than IIymeswold, or heard any music better than the drawling of that intolerable country choir." Miss Rogers saw this chan(e in Mattie with regret, and sometimes felt it almost her duty to inform her brother and sis- ter, and have Mattie called home before she should lose the will and power of making those happy whose happiness should be the chief object of her present life. She mentioned the sub- ject to Mr. Atherton, but he said:    Hr i           CHESTNUT WOOD.          139 Mattie's good sense will correct this in a fbe years. Let her live it out; she can never be more unfitted or likely to lmake trouble at home than just at present. Her parents would consider her thoroughly spoiled, whereas she is only passing through a crisis which many have undergone before heI and lave come out from, more rational, and less liable to fall into the same error a second time." Mr. Atherton was certainly right, if Mattie had not sufficiellt in her character to come to a proper appreciation of her situa- tion in life, of herself, no one could help her to it, and so aunt Mary became very soon convinced, thoulgh she did not quite fall in with the policy which induced Mr. Atherton, instead of restricting her; to give her more liberty, and provide more I ne sources of amusement. "Let her exhaust them," he said, in reply to a half ventured c:is:ostulation from Miss Ro,ers, she ivi1 soon find low empty !  they ll are, how wholly insufficient to bestow any real or last- "Sybil would, but Afattie, I fear is naturally too fond of ex- citement, tod volatile,' too little thought for others, to give a mo- ment's sober reflection to anythin g that provides present amuse- ment," answeredt aunt  tary; but her remark produced no ef- fect.

Sybil showed less desire-than before goin g to Chestnut Wood to be abroad.

One evening M iss Ro  gers aind 3attie bothl being out, Sybil was sitting alone by the parlor window watching the stream of  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7089-00000071"/> "O         CHESTNUT WOOD. life, that rolled so unceasingly along, when her attention was arrested- by a young woman who passed many times up and down on the side walk opposite, looking each time stead- ily in at-the window. She was neatly, but very plainly dressed, and wore a thick veil drawn carefully down over her face. The fourth time she passed, Sybil rose and went close to the window, to catch a little more distinct view of her. She evidently in her turn attracted attention, for the woman stop- ped and was crossing over the street, when Sybil, a little star- tled by the action, dropped the shade and withdrew to another part of the room. When Mattie returned, she came running in with an odd description of a woman, who had stopped her as she was coming up thile street, and inquired not only who occupied No. 22, but had wished a minute description of every person, particularly," turning to Sybil, "of you. She asked me how old you were, how you looked, how you dressed, whether that large black dog, with a gold collar, belonged to you, and even what his name was."    W "All of which questions I suppose you answered in a most satisfactory manner," said aunt Mary, quite as much amused as Mattie herself. "' Most satisfactory. That is, I told her who we were, where we came from, and-what we were here for. Especially about Sybil, I enlarged most poetically. I told her she was the most beautiful, the most accomplished, and the richest heiress in all the United States, and that she was just as good as she was everything else, and she believed every word of; it, I know she did, for she kept asking me questions about her, which showedl she was very much interested; and then she began to question me about the dog again, and I said, he was a very uncommon animal, and so much attached to Miss Thornton, that if any one attempted to molest her in any way, he would certainly tear them to pieces. Then she laughed outright, and that was the only thing about her which I did not like. The laugh sound-   CHESTNUT WOOD.         141 ed, I don't know, sort of triumphant, so I left her and came home. But who do you think she was, and for what could she have wanted to ask all those questions?" "Probably some insane person," answered aunt Mary. "It is not safe for you to stop and talk so with people in the street. Mr. Atherton, I am sure, would not approve of it." Sybil said, " it must be the same person that she had noticed walking up and down before the house," and aunt Mary listen- ed with less satisfaction to her account of what she had seen. Surmises occupied all their time until Mr. Atherton came in, when the whole story was repeated to him, and certainly it ap- peared of more importance to him than it had to any of the I others, for he remained quiet and thoughtful, and as Miss Rog- ers glanced from time to time at his face, she thought, almost I sad. The next morning he took occasion to say that "' he hoped if Sybil should walk out, she would take Nep with her, for he thought the dog really growing old and indolent from the con- stant confinement in doors, and his limb which was not yet strong, allowed him to walk so little, that he saw no other way to give him exercise." It was nothing unusual for Mr. Atherton to be thoughtful for Nep; so without exciting any remark Sybil promised to go to walk, a long walk, that should leave her aged guardian, pnless he should speedily renew his youth and activity, far be- hind her. "Then Miss Rogers had better accompany you and keep you in order, for the poor dog's sake." said Mr. Atherton, with a smile; but aunt Mary understood it as it was meant, as a re- quest that she should not allow Sybil to go far, or be out long alone. She saw evidently that his fears were excited, and that he wished to use every precaution without alarming Sybil. Several days passed, and although all kept a vigilant watch for the -c insane woman," she was nowhere to be seen. Even Mr. Atherton began to be less strict in his inquiries and guar-  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7089-00000072"/> "2     -  CHSTNUT WtOOD. ded in his injunctions, and they were becoming satisfied that th person was really some wanderer from a lunatic asylum, whos fancy had become interested in the house, and particularly i the uncommon sight of Sybil and her large Newfoundland do Fortunately for Sybil, not a fear or suspicion was aroused Fher tin, and though a never to be forgotten sorrow and fe lay constantly upon her heart, yet she was less timid, for as sl now knew what it was, there was less opportunity for nervo apprehensions and forebodings. One day when she was walking with Iattie, she sudde  graspeed   her arm There! there! she is," she said, poiati to a figure which was fast disappearing around the corner the street. "The very same woman; I shela know that and dress any where, I looked at it so closely when I met 1 Come, let us follow her, and see if she will know us." Drawn by an irresistible impulse for which she could nt account, Sybil went with her down the next street,thro many parts of the city where she had never been before, at last stopped at the entrance of an alley, whose miserable filthy appearance forbade them to go any farther. As tle alln was about entering a low door she looked up the alley started with no small surprise to see the two young ladies the large do, standing still, evidently watching LLer.

She passed them however, without speaking, though Sybil felt two dark and very piercing eyes gaze at her intently, through the thick veil. She now became thoroughly frightened, and hurried home without daring to look on either side of her, for fear she should encounter them again. Mattie wished to persuade her to keep the incidents of their ; walk entirely to themselves, but concealment was no part of Sybil's nature, particularly if she felt that she had done X ^ F- wrong; therefore, one of the first things she did, on reaching home, was to repeat all to her grandfather. He looked annoyed, but made no remark, and Mattie quite congratulated herself that they-had escaped so easily. Miss Rogers, however, felt obliged to take the matter up more seriously, and when they were alone together, drew such a picture of the risk they had incurred, that she had reason to be very. well satisfied with the impression she had produced. But Mattie had a great spice of mother Eve about her. The fact of its being almost forbidden fixed her mind upon it with double interest, and although not i daring to directly disobey, she went to sleep, hoping that by some means she should yet be able to prosecute her acquaintance with the strange woman. For weeks after, she made various excuses for being much in the street, but at last, not even catch- ing a glimpse of her, she gave her up as put safely back into the asylum, from which she had escaped, and therefore lost to her. Every day she imparted the knowledge of where she had been, and how she had failed, to Sybil, though in so careless a n manner, that Sybil never suspected, how important a part of every day's plan she had made the meeting. ; Sybil gradually lost the memory of the keen, dark eyes, and r   * walked out, without dreading to meet them, and Miss Rogers, t   ssure of her implicit obedience to her expressed wishes, also gave  &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC7089-00000073"/> i44     CHIESTNUT VOOI).

The large round hand, and precise manner in which this note ws worded, were bcts of mortification to AMattie, especially as it was directed to  Atherton; but the cordial mann"er in which he bade her write, and say, that he should be most happy to ee them, removeds all fears of the religious tenor of the note exciting his dis X pleasure, and as she studied Aunt Mary's face attentively, she saw there was not a shade of trouble upon it.

That would do more respectably, landlord of 'he R                  !sing Su   CHESTNUT WOOD.         145 though looking quite enough like country people ; but her mother was afraid of the colt as she persisted in calling him, though his colthood lay back some ten years at least; still there was no other to be hired, unless, and it was a happy thought, Mr. Langdon should offer his cabriolet, and young horses, and perhaps- nothing in this case was too great to expect-- drive them to the city himself. How very fine that would be! How much less ashamed Mr. Atherton would feel, to have such an equipage stop at his door. She wanted to write, and tell her father how very desirable it was, but fortunately she mentioned it to Aunt Mary first, who immediately endeavored to explain to her, how little like her delicate father, it would be, to ask any such favor, and how more than probable it was, that they would come in a stage coach. An old lumbering stage coach, what could be worse! Mattie began to feel desperate, therefore was never ceasingin her plans, and if her parents had had half as many to make, they would not have seen New York. The day on which they were to come, at length actually arrived, and Mattie  and Sybil stationed themselves at the window to watch fbr them. Mattie  knew her father's habits of being punctual to a moment, and he had said they should arrive " at twelve o'clock."  It wanted just two minutes of twelve, when the noise of wheels coming in a slow, and digni- fied manner up the street, made all look out. There had been hundreds moving in that very same way, over that same ground before, that morning; but there is some mysterious power, which informs us when the right one comes, so now, there was no doubt among the expectant group around that window, that those wheels brought their guests.

She recognized E  nothing else, and was taken quite by surprise, when Jerry, catch- "! ing her hand, said: -  "So you ain't glad to see nobody else, because your father and mother have come, are you?" The whole was explained. Mr. Atherton, with his customary thoughtfulness, had written to Jerry to bring them, whenever :?  they should be ready to come, and Jerry was only too glad to ,+ : obey. So the old yellow chaise, and even the sorrel colt were allowed to remain at home, and Mrs. Rogers in the elegant estab- lishment, belonging to " the richest gentleman who lived where - I her husband was minister," envied no queen upon her throne. "It was the proudest and happiest day of her life," so she said j ; often to Mr. Rogers, as Jerry drove them rapidly along. Good, X-  meek man, that he was,.he only half enjoyed it ; he had a feel- ing that it was not quite ministerial to be riding in such style, and would really have felt vastly more at home, and happier in the old yellow chaise. Thoughts of' the poor brethren who went on foot, would obtrude themselves, and when he reached the city, instead of sitting by the window, not only to see, but also to be seen, he felt inclined to crouch out of sight, almost like a criminal going to some place of confinement. ! It was a great relief to him to get out of the carriage, stretch e his long weary limbs, and find himself no more trammelled with  any questionable appendages to his darling ministerial dignity. During the whole of their acquaintance, M:r. Atherton had  come into very little personal contact with him, and had he been i less of a gentleman he would have found himself rather awk- wardly situated now; but he soon came to feel as much at home with him, as two persons of such opposite characters may ever be supposed to be, and at least had the power of making the r   s  f -   CHESTNUT WOOD.         147 minister so much at home with him, that when it came the hour for retiring, he turned to ask for the family Bible, to attend prayers, as he was accustomed. "Certainly," said Mr. Atherton, by some magic which Aunt Mary never could understand, comprehending at once the intture of the only half uttered request. "Sybil, you have a Bible, I suppose; bring it to Mr. Rogers." Whlat a golden opportunity! Mrs. Rogers's heart beat quickly; what an eventful moment. Should :Mr. Rogers be gifted, how much good might follow. Ah! Mrs. Rogers, if instead of watching every word of that long rambling epistle, and weighing its probable consequence, your own heart had been lifted in petition for that blessing which you so much desire, you would much more probably have aided in bringing about the result. Mr. Atherton did not kneel, but he stood with folded hands, and attitude of attention. It was a pity, that that erect figure must come even between the pious Mrs. Rogers and the mercyseat. Perhaps, as they separated for the night, no one of them all appreciated this act of politeness on Mr. Atherton's part, but Miss Roguers, and she felt alike touched, and grateful for it, though she took care to inform her brother, that he must not ask for, or expect, a renewal of the same thing again. The new broadcloth suit, and silk dress, had been reserved for city fashions, and to get these made up quickly and cheaply, was the first object of their visit. The first was easily ac- complished, but the latter! How many times Miss Palmy Fitch's name was on Mr. Rogers's tongue, and how severely the good manl regretted, that her fingers were not to fashion the garments as heretofore. "Why Mattie!" he said, in reply to entreaties on her part, that he would have the work done quietly without sayin g any more about it; , Don't you know, child, that Miss Palmy would make a   whole suit, vest and all, for what the tailor charges here for only the coat? think of it child, think of it!"  &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7089-00000075"/> "8        CHESTNUT WOOD.              ::. Miss Rogers took much pains to keep this difficulty away from Mr. Atherton, but Mr. Rogers was in too much real trou- ble, and as he thought, too much need of advice, to keep the matter to himself, so he received in answer to his inquiries a written order to Mr. Atherton's own tailor to make the-suit in his best manner, and charge the work to himself. To do Mr. Rogers justice, he really felt mortified at the result of his per- severance, but Mrs. Rogers only regarded it as a proof of their growing popularity with the rich man and " a special dispensa- tion of Providence." A few days saw them dressed up in their best, and Mattie and Sybil accompanying them, to see and hear all the min- isterial sights and sounds in the city. There was now no fault to be found with their wardrobe, but that certain somne- thing, which a country minister and his wife acquire after a long life of active labor; all the tailors and dress makers in the city could only make it more apparent. It showed itself in their faces, it spoke out in every tone of their voice ; each invol- untary-movement told the story, and not a keen eyed trader in the city, but knew that he had a fair opportunity of cheating a country minister and his wife. "Don't point, father," Mattie would say, many times, during their walks. "Mother! don't run across the street so fast, no carriage will run over you; the drivers are too used to foot passengelrs." "Do you think I have never been in the city before?" was her sharp rejoinder. "I can assure you I have lived here longer than you ever will." Such reproofs did Mattie good; the child was fast forgetting the duties she owed her parents, and this Mrs. Rogers very soon found out. It was a "city air" which did not, on the whole, quite please her. One afternoon Mrs. Rogers returned, bringing with her a   guest quite as unwelcome as he was unexpected. It was no other personage than Mr. Frederick Langdon. Mr. Atherton's distant and haughty bow quite frightened Mrs. Rogers ; she could not imagine how she had offended, nor as she glanced from the pale face of Sybil to the red cheeks of Mattie, what had made such a change in them. She became embarrassed - painfully so - and was not at all aided, by the still and stiff manners of her husband. Mr. Langdon had been for some time in the city, so Mrs. Rogers had before informed them, but they had never come in contact with him, and the happy relief might have remained longer had not Mrs. Rogers unexpectedly met him, and with the ready warmth of country politeness urged his immediate return home with her. Mr. Langdon was only too happy to comply, and with his usual effrontery intruded himself into Mr. Atherton's parlor. Mr. Atherton left the room almost immediately, but Sybil sat rooted to the spot, without any power to move or to utter a word.  After Mr. Atherton was gone, Mattie and her mother tried to'make amends for the coldness of his reception by the others, by being more than usually agreeable, and certainly if they were to judge by the length of the call which he made, they were eminently successful. Sybil after some time gathered courage to leave the room, but not until she saw upon his face an expression of maligfnant triumph. Miss Rogers expostulated with her sister more warmly than was her wont, after Mr. Langdon's departure, on the frivolty and coarseness which were so apparent in the young man, and to her surprise, Mr. Rogers fully agreed with her; but they both only received for an answer, that "They did not know what it was to be a minister's wife, and how important it was she should please everybody without re- spect to their manners or appearance." 13*  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7089-00000076"/> 150        CHESTNUT WTOOD. Aunt Mary knew by her tone that it would do no good to contradict her, and her husband had attempted it too many times when they were alone together, to care to venture now. Mattie, on the whole, was pleased. She knew no gentle- man in New York, and the jewelled and whiskered Mr. Lanrg- don would pass in Broadway without any occasion for feeling ashamed of him. If Mrs. Rogcers had known this decision of' Mattie, it would have been more convincing to her, than anlly argument, against him; but Mattie had long since learned, that to have her own way, she must keep most of her plans and wishes to herself. Mrs. Rogers did not invite Mr. Langdon to call again, but he had no need of an invitation, he easily asked himself, and Mr. Atherton could hardly restrain his indignation when he heard his name given at the door. Fortunately, both Mrs. Rorgers and Mattie were out, and he had no excuse for enter- ing; Nep, also, was at home, lying on his mat behind the hall door, and he showed a desire to renew his acquaintance, in a [ way so unequivocal that Mr. Lang:don seemed glad to make a ' hasty retreat, and if any one had been watching him they would have seen that he stepped quickly, and looked often  around as he went. "The wicked flee when no man pursueth." Mr. Langdon had learned the truth of this verse of the Bible many times practically, but it gave him no courage whenever he thought himself in any danger; so now, he did not slacken his pace  until he found himself removed at what he was sure must be a safe distance from the dog.  His doublings and counter doublings would have been very cu- rious if he had been watched. He went around the same streets,  never on the same side of the walk, availed himself of every al- ley, or underground passage that was to be found, and looked before and behind him frequently, with a quick, searching, steal-   CHESTNUT WOOD.         151 thy glance, which certainly would have been enough in itself to attract suspicion. After various circumlocutions today, he came to the same alley, at the entrance of which, Sybil and Mattie had stopped, and after a careful survey of the premises, went to the door which the woman they had been following had attempted to enter, and knocked three times with distinct and peculiar raps. A short interval followed, then three raps more of the same kind, and the door was cautiously opened, no figure being visi- ble, and as cautiously closed after him. "So you have come at last, have you?" said the woman who had answered the summons. " I should think it was time." "Cross, this morning, are you, Nancy? Well that is noth- ing very new, it seems to come natural to you of late, but I am getting tired of it." "; Get tired of it then, it doesn't matter to me." "But it does matter pretty seriously to you, and you have found that out times enough already. Why can't you once, in a great while be pleasant and speak cheerfully like other folks?" "Because, I ami not like other folks, and have no reason to be cheerful. I am tired of living." "Why don't you die, then; I don't know as any one prevents your doing as you have a mind to?" "Look here. I am in no mood this morning for being vex- ed; you had better be careful what you do and say; I grow every day more and more desperate, and as for being mixed up with any more of your villany, I plainly tell you, let the consequences be what they may, that I will not." "Help me to marry that girl, and you shall be rich for life." a What security have I?" "Any you desire."

"Your bond is wortl no more than blank paper."  "What will you have? Come in here, some one may hear us," and he drew her into a squalid, filthy, inner room. "Now be good natured and let us make our plans together. I have much to tell you, and should have been here before, but I wanted to know a little more first. What have you done for supplies?" "Starved," and the woman's ghastly face and protruding dark eyes, verified the truth of her words. "Not a morsel has passed my lips for two days. I could not beg, you know I will not steal, so I have gone without.  "There! buy some food," said Langdon, throwing down a  half dollar," and eat first; you'll not be good natured while you are hungry." The woman eagerly took the money, and carrying it to the window examined it carefully. "It is good, you need not look ." "Well." She put her bonnet and shawl on quickly, and  went out. Mr. Langdon occupied himself during her absence in exam-  ining carefully every part of the room. He looked cautiously, restoring every article so exactly to its place as to leave no: sus- picion of its ever having been removed, and stopped if he heard the slightest noise in, or around the house. He had but just finished his search when the woman returned. She en- tered softly, as if expecting to surprise him in some such occu-  pation, but he was quietly sitting on the side of the only table in the room, drumming with his fingers in a most indifferent  manner. "You have looked thoroughly, I suppose, since I went out,"  she said. "What did you find?" "You are always suspecting me of somethng ." Vi;   CHESTNUT WOOD.         153 "Because you are always doing something. You can no more live without tricks than without breathing." "I hoped you would come back without being cross. If you are going to do nothing but fret, I will go away again." "The sooner the better." "This is all my thanks for your money." "All your thanks for my starvation." "I came here to talk with you about that girl. If you are going to talk with me I will stay; if not, the sooner I go, the less we shall quarrel." "What about her?" "Now, Nancy, you know just as well as I do, and you need n't go to making strange of it. You know I mean to marry her, really and lawfully, and then I shall have a right to money enough, to make us all comfortable for life." "Has her father consented?" 6 He does not dare to say no. All he does is to hang his head and keep still, or swear like a trooper. But it don't mat- ter. He must consent in the end, or if he don't I do n't know as it is any of his concern; the money don't belong to him, if the girl does." "I have seen her." "Seen her! when and where?" "At her grandfather's house and in the street; once in this very alley." "Did you speak to her?" "No; but I talked with the other one. She was ready to tell me everything. You may marry her." Mr. Langdon laughed a long, loud laugh. "Thank you, I want the money, the girl any one may have. I only take her because I can't help it. The other one is poor. I should prefer her if she were not." "What do you propose to do now?" "Exactly the thing about which I want to talk with you. I  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7089-00000078"/> 154        CHESTNUT WOOD. came here on purpose. No possibility of eavesdroppers, I sup- pose?" .  ," Nancy made a gesture of impatience. "You are in the  room," was her only answer. MLr. Langdon opened each door and listened attentively; not a sound was to be heard; he seemed satisfied, and came back to his seat. "What I want to do," he said, "is this. One thing is very certain; there is no such thing as marrying her by fait means. The old'man is dead set against me, so is the girl, and worse than all, that big brute of a dog. Whatever we do must be by stratagem. We can't carry her off. We did that once, and what good did it do us? If she got away then when she was so little, she would n't be caught at all, now she is so large. We can't do anything by force, we must work by cunning; and you women are worth a hundred of us men for such head work."9 "I do n't know enough about her, or the way she lives, or what she does, to help you." "You must find them all out." "How?" "Just what I want you to, decide. Can't you hire yourself j out to them as a servant; you are smart enough to do any- F thing?" ' If I have sufficient object." "Is n't it enough to have money and no more to do all the rest of your life?" "No more sin, yes." "Do n't be so backward in helping me then. Wake up youlr wits a little and plan for yourself."          ? - "Nancy walked up and down the room with quick, restless ! steps; suddenly stopping she said:-            A "Do you suppose she knows Billings and Mr. Frederick   Langdon are the same person?" "I can take my oath that she never suspects it." i   CHESTNUT WOOD.         155 "Would she remember me?" "You are changed, but you can wear false hair and paint your eyebrows, dress up in showy clothes, and perhaps limp a little; you would never forget to." "No; but she will not know me," and Nancy smiled a ghast- ly smile enough. "I was young then; I am old and sick now." "As Mr. Langdon looked at her carefully, he thought there was very little probability that any one who had once known her would recognize her now. He had never before realized how much she was changed, and a gleam of pleasure shot across his face. "You say," continued Nancy, speaking slowly, " that I can hire myself out as a servant. Yes, I can. I can do anything; but a servant requires a recommendation." "I can write you any number." "Of true ones?" "Yes, as true as any body uses." "Suppose they should inquire into them?" "Family removed from the city; it is always a ready an- swer." "Perhaps they have a kitchen full now." "Always changing; it would n't be New York if the ser- vants staid long at one place." "How shall I find out?" "Go into the kitchen, tell them you heard they were in search of a servant, and came to offer yourself; that you bring the very highest recommendations, and are very desirous to go into a place at once, as you have a sick mother entirely depend- ant upon you for support." "And if they ask where my mother lives?" "Any one would think you were a fool to hear how you ask me questions. Why can't you say that she is in the country, or make up something. Have you always stuck so to the truth that you do n't know how to lie?"  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7089-00000079"/> 156        CHESTNUT WOOD. Suppose I do this, and they hire me, what then? I want to know all that is before me." I thought you said yourself you must get acquainted with the girl befbre you could plan." "I did before 1 could; but what do you mean to do?" "I have told you times enough - marry the girl." "Have you any idea how this can be brought about?" "No very plain one; but there is a young fellow down in the country who is desperately in love with her. I have a no- tion of bringing it about through him in some way." "An odd help I should think he would be. What is his name? "Charles Wallace. I believe he is in college, but will be out and ready to marry her, money and all, if we do n't hurry to get the start of him. When will you go?" "To-night, to-morrow; almost any time, if I go at all." "And you will go?" "Perhaps so. I am in no hurry to make up my mind. I require some pay beforehand. I have worked too long with you, to trust you far." "What will you have?" Fifty dollars the day I go into the family as a servant, and two thousand the day you marry her." "You are moderate in your claim. I will promise you five  thousand."  "I want only enough to keep me from hunger. On these terms I will go."  "We are agreed, then. Go to-day." "This hour, I care not how soon; but remember I sell my freedom to no one. Any time I choose I can say quit." "And the money?" "Shall be every cent returned." "Well, so be it; only make haste, for time and want both press."   CHESTNUT WOOD.         157 'I am gone!" said Nancy, again putting on her hat and shawl. She needed no time to make herself neat, for although the apartment was in such a condition, her person was scrupu- lously clean, and her dark dress whole and tidy. She did not seem to hesitate to leave her room open and Mr. Langdon there; neither had she any arrangement to make before leaving. She stopped at a bread store, bought a loaf of bread, ate it like a famished person, then without turning from the object before her, walked straight on to Mr. Atherton's house. Mrs. Giles was in no very lenient mood when called into the kitchen to see her, for she had just lain down in her snug, quiet room, to take her after-dinner nap, but the cook said the girl had come into the house and would not leave without see- ing some one. Mrs. Giles fidgeted about for a few moments, put on a clean cap, and tied over her half open dress her silk apron, before going down. The delay gave Nancy time to re- cover from the slight alarm she felt at finding herself fairly within the house, and when Mrs. Giles came in, she had her story all ready upon her lips. As fate would have it, the second chambermaid had been that day dismissed, and one was wanted in her place. This only made the story more probable, and Mrs. Giles, taking out her spectacles; inquired with much dignity for her recom- mendation. Nancy in her haste had forgotten all about it. She said so, and offered to go for it and return within an hour. There was something in her prompt, energetic manner, which quite took Mrs. Giles's fancy, and much to the astonishment of the other servants, she consented to retain the place for her pntil her return. With almost winged feet Nancy went home. She was sure she should be too late, that Billings would have gone beyond her reach. But she did not calculate upon the determination with which he had made up his mind to succeed. She hardly VOL.

"I knew it," he said without looking up or stopping. "I knew you would come back after it, so I have been writing it. Here it is. It is good, only I have changed your name, of } course. "Ann Matson," - Ann is a short, good servant's name; they would take you for that alone:- "Ann Matson is a capable, intelligent, honest girl, used to all manner of house-work, and will prove an excellent servant to whoever hires her." "SUSAN WOODBRIDGE. 9 Houston St." Several similar ones were written; but neither Nancy or Mrs. Giles could detect the bad spelling. Indeed, Nancy could not read a word, either of writing or printing, so she was obliged to trust entirely to what Billings read himself. But she felt safe, because he had the object to gain. Mrs. Giles had left directions to have the papers brought up to her, and Nancy awaited with apparent indifference the result. "You may go up to her room,' said the servant, who re- turned; " she will speak with you, there." Nancy had never in all her life put her foot within a house fur- nished as this. There was something almost frightful to her in the soft velvet carpets, which gave back no sound. The parlor doors were opened, and the rich window curtains, and costly chairs and divans, made the rooms seem to her to belong to a new world. She peeped cautiously within ; the walls were hung with pic- tures, and the long mirrors reached from the ceiling to the floor. In one of them she caught a glimpse of her gaunt and sickly face, and its expression of eager curiosity perhaps startled her more than anything else. She stole up stairs so softly, that the servant who preceded her turned several times, to make   CHESTNUT 'WOOD.         15 9 sure she was indeed following. She had paused to allow her to look into the parlor; there was something which flattered her pride, in the admiration which she saw it excited. Good servants always appropriate whatever is great or distinguishing in the circumstances of those they serve; they become, in very truth, part and parcel of the establishment; and are often far happier in the borrowed light, than those to whom it really belongs. So, now, Nancy's evident astonishment and admira- tion quite won upon the good graces of the servant, and proved an important aid in securing the place. , I think, Mrs. Giles," she said, stepping in before Nancy, and speaking in a low voice to the housekeeper; "The girl will do well, she seems active and bright, and looks about her as if she had sense." Mrs. Giles nodded an acquiescing nod, and the servant went back to report to the kitchen. Mrs, Giles examined the recommendations with much appa- rent satisfaction. She was not conscious of the bad spelling, and for the rest, only so Nancy had a written paper, it mattered very little what was within it. As she looked at her face closely, through- her spectacles, she was struck and almost frightened by its ghastly hue. "Are you ever sick?" she asked. "No; -never since I can remember." "Have rou been up, watching with your mother, lately." "No, my mother is in the country; but I have been out of place, and hungry." "You look half-starved," involuntarily exclaimed Mrs. Giles. "You may stay a fortnight, and I will try to get you more fleshy and looking better, that is, if you do your work well; but if at the end of that time, you look as wo-begone as you do now, I shall have to dismiss you; you certainly would not be pre- sentable." Nancy stood with her eyes cast upon the floor, as perfect a  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7089-00000081"/> 160        ' CHESTNUT WOOD.             ! picture of submission and dejection as was ever seen. Without - being conscious of the reason why, Mrs. Giles began to pity : her very much, and dismissed her to the kitchen, with orders to ! X the cook for a luncheon, immediately.            : ;! Those large, dark eyes! How they haunted Mrs. Giles after Nancy left the room. She began to feel exceedingly un- comfortable as she lay on her bed, resting; so she got up, and went down to superintend the luncheon, and introduce Nancy, or, as she called her, Ann, into her new duties. Ann had not asked fbr her luncheon; she was much- too proud to do so; besides, she really was not hungry, and when Mrs. Giles set before her a somewhat ostentatious looking table she turned, really sickened, away from it.          i "I cannot eat, I thank you, ma'am," she said; "will you give me some work to do?" Mrs. Giles was a little offended, for no one likes to have a kindness wholly refused; and had Ann but attempted to eat, even though she had hot swallowed a single mouthful, she would have been better pleased; but she put her to sweeping and dusting; though she was so astonished at the awkward way she I managed her broom, that she was obliged to take it herself, and give a lesson on the spot, a lesson which Ann very gratefully received and immediately profited by. That night, when MNaggy went to the young ladies' room, she  had many stories to tell them of the new, queer-looking, silent, half-starved servant, whom Mrs. Giles had hired; but her kind  heart was full of pity and of plans for making the new-comer  happy and contented. She became quite an object of curiosity to Sybil and Mattie; 1' and they both took occasion to go to the part of the house   where she was occupied, to see her. She was busily at work, when they entered, nor once raised her eyes or in any way gave a sign that she knew any other person beside herself was i in the room.

"You look very pale,'; continued Sybil; "are you sick,?" N Lo, ma'am." The work was resumed with more vigor than before; and it was manifest, to Sybil, that she had no wish to continue the conversation. "What curious eyes,"' said Mattie, as they went back to- the parlor; "it seems to me as if I must have seen her before; does n't it to you, Sybil?" "I only caught a glimpse of her, as she looled up; and yet, it did seem to me as if I had seen those eyes before,--when or where, I cannot remember; but somewhere, way back, when I was a child, I should think; I wonder if Aunt Mary re- members her." Aunt Mary was sought, and asked to go on the same errand of curiosity; but she was too busy, and too afraid of hurting a stranger's feelings; so she compromised matters by promising to observe her well the first time she should meet her. And this promise she faithfully kept, and was more astonished than perhaps any one else, to find how strange an inmate their family had so suddenly received. "*  &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7089-00000082"/> CHAPTER VIII. MR. and Mrs. Rogers's visit was an era in their lives. It made only the third great event which had ever marked the even tenor of its way. The first, was the birth of Mattie; that special dispensation of Providence in their favor. The second, the donation visit; and the third, this visit, under all these favorable auspices, to the city of New York. As the appointed time for returning was hastening on, they began to prize, even more deeply, the free- dom from care and the luxuries by which they were sur- rounded, Mrs. Rogers said to Aunt Mary, rather peevishy, that " she did not see how she could ever go home happily to her housework again; she had never realized how much of a servant she had been; she really thought, now as she was growing old, she ought to be spared a little, and have a girl to help her." Aunt Mary fully agreed with her, and what was of more practical importance, offered to pay the wages if she would take one home from the city, for a year. When Mr. Rogers heard the plan, he immediately refused to allow any such thing to be done: "Sister Mary had no one to provide for her old age; and Mrs. Rogers should have a servant, if she considered it best, after being back a week at Hymeswold." Mr. Rogers knew his wife well. He knew that one week of the quiet performance of her home duties would bring back the old contented state of heart. Jerry had not   CH-ESTNUT WOOD.         163 remained in the city, but was written for, to come up and carry the minister and his wife back; but the day before their return, an unexpected denouement took place, which- added a third to the number that were to return to Hymeswold. Since Mr. Langdon's call at the house, Mattie had shown a desire to be much more in the street than ever before. She went out often alone, and where she went or for what, no one inquired. Aunt Mary was not as vigilant as usual, while her parents were visiting her; she hardly noticed where she was, or how occupied. Going into Mrs. Rogers's chamber the afternoon before her sister was to return home, she surprised herself and Mattie in a very earnest conversation; some words of which she could not avoid hearing:-- "I will take you right home to Hymeswold, and put you to work in the kitchen, if I ever know of your doing it again," said Mrs. Rogers, in a highly excited tone. "But, mother, --" "No ' but-mother' about it, Matilda Rogers! The long and the short of it is, that I will not allow it! and that you may as well set down, first as last." ' Do not talk so loud, mother; some one will certainly hear you." "I had as soon they would as not;" at the same time, Mrs. Rogers's voice fell two or three notes; "I shall talk with your Aunt Mary, before I leave." "That would be very foolish in you, mother." "I dare say, you think so; but I am glad I am not obliged to consult all your opinions." Aunt Mary had by this time made her approach known, and the conversation came abruptly to a close; but both looked heated and excited. Mattie gave her mother a supplicating look, which the mother's heart could not resist; so Mrs. Rogers stoutly resisted the inclination to make known her troubles,  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7089-00000083"/> 164        CHESTNUT WOOD. which was so unrestrained a part of her nature, and Mattie, watching her time, quietly slipped out; nor did her mother miss her, until she was startled by hearing the outer door shut. I told her, she should n't go," she said, running to the win- dow and throwing it up, as she would have done in the country. "Matilda, Matilda Rogers! come back! come back!" she screamed after her; but Mattie kept her head turned reso- lutely away, and going around the first corner, was out of sight. "Give me my bonnet, quick, Mary Rogers, or she will be gone!" and Mrs. Rogers flew from one part of the room to another, little likely to find her bonnet, till she had head enough to know what she wanted. "What is the matter, sister?" said Aunt Mlary, endeavoring to quiet her, by the use of a very gentle tone; i what has hap- pened, where has Mattie gone?" "Give me my bonnet! or I shall never overtake her." "4 No, you cannot overtake her now. She is out of sight, and you would only lose your way, if you should attempt to follow her." Mrs. Rogers sank down in a large chair, apparently perfectly exhausted, and Aunt Mary continued her efforts to soothe her. "Mattie has been a long time in the city, I don't see what harm can come to her," she said. "I never think of troubling about her, when she goes out, and I didn't know as you did." '( She will worry me into my grave," said Mrs. Rogers, burst- ing into tears. "She will kill me, yet, I know she will, and a ninister's daughter too! what will her father say?" "When you are quiet, sister, I wish you would tell me what she hlas done," asked Aunt Mary, now beginning to be really troubled. "Done! why she meets him, that Mr. Langdon, and goes to walk with him every- day. I met them together yesterday, and again to-day, and now, she has gone out to go to, some exhibi- tion with him."   CHESTNUT WOOD.          165 "Impossible, sister, you must be mistaken." "1 wish I was, but -I made her confess it, and then I forbade her ever speaking to him, or going near him again, and right in the face of it, she has gone out." "' But I don't believe she has gone to meet him." "I kzow she has, I saw it in her eye. She looked just as she used to when shel was a child, and would have her own way, and I only wish I had punished her, or shut her up in a closet, just as I used to then. How could I ever have let her come away from me? I might have known she would get spoiled in the city. "But this Mr. Langdon is a country acquaintance, and one that you yourself brought into the house. He would never have dared to come otherwise," said Aunt AMary a little sharply. "All the worse for that, I wish I had never come to New York." "Really, sister, I think you take this matter a little too seriously. Have you any idea to what exhibition Mattie said she was going?" "To the Museum, to see some play acted," said Mrs. Rogers, hysterically sobbing, " and she a minister's daughter too, it will kill her father." - Where is my brother?" "Gone out! Don't you tell, him, Mary Rogers, for the world. It would kill him." "But he must know it, and some one must be sent to bring Mattie directly home." "The Rev. Mr. Rogers, the minister of Hymeswold, can never enter such a place," said Mrs. Rogers, drawing herself up and drying her tears. "What would the people say?" 4"But his daughter, sister!" "Must reap what she sows." "I will go myself, and bring her," said Aunt Mary. No one then need know of Mattie's imprudence but ourselves."  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7089-00000084"/> 166         CHESTNUT WOOD. "Bless you, 5Mary! you were always the most thoughtful creature in the world. Don't waste a moment talking. Bring her back, and I will settle matters with her very soon, once for all." Miss Rogers never acted hastily. She had educated herself to habits of patient and thorough investigation, let the matter be ever so slight. If it was worth doing at all, it was worth doing well; so she often said, and oftener thought; therefore when she did, as in the present instance, decide quickly upon any course of action, her judgment was so well educated, that she seldom found any cause to regret it. She had all the dislike and dread of a low vulgar place of amusement, which one of her refinement and piety might be supposed to have. She had never been inside of a theatre, hardly of a concert room, in her life, and she now found herself on her way, for the first time, to a Museum. She drew her veil closely over her face; she knew no one in -the city, but the consciousness of what she was about to do, was quite as painful as if it had been known to every person she met. She had a faint hope of meeting Mattie on her way thither, and once or twice it occurred to her, that if, after all, she should not have gone thither, how more than useless would be the mortification she was now suffering. Just as she hads reached the inner door, and was about purchasing her ticket, she heard a loud voice talking behind her; turning, to her inex- pressible relief, she saw Mr. Langdon, with Mattie leaning upon his arm. Mattie was evidently in a state of high excitement, for she laughed frequently, and not in a very ladylike manner, and when Aunt Mary's eye first fell upon her, her cheeks were red, and her eyes very bright. Mr. Langdon was much struck by her appearance, and his bold bragging way showed that he waris also much pleased. They both saw Miss Rogers at the same instant, and an oath froml Mr. Langdon, and a little scream from Mattie testified their astonishment,   CHESTNUT WOOD.         . 67 "Mattie!" said Miss Rogers, stepping quickly up to her, "come home with me instantly." Mattie dropped Mr. Langdon's arm. "She shall not go un- less she wants to," he said, taking her hand, and replacing it. "Mattie! Come home!" said Aunt Mary, gently, but firmly, taking her other hand. "Let her alone," said Mr. Langdon, roughly. By this time, the rabble which usually fill the outer entry of such places, began to collect around them, and both Miss Rogers and Mattie shrank from the contact. Mr. Langdon too seemed alarmed, and without any more words, Mattie drew her arm once more away and placed it within Aunt Mary's. "Now look neither to the right hand, nor to the left," whis- pered Aunt Mary, " and we shall soon be out." , Mattie hung her head, and literally obeyed. They found themselves free from the crowd, and when they dared turn to look behind them, Mr. Langdon too, haddisappeared. Without either of them speaking a word they- walked quickly home. As they turned into the street in which they lived, they saw hrs. Rogers, with her head out of the window, looking up and down the street. Mattie started, trembled, and clung closely to Aunt Mary's side. It was the first time in her life, she had ever trembled at the sight of her mother. "Did she tell you, Aunt Mary?" she asked. "Yes," was Aunt Mary's only reply. "Is she very angry?" "Yes." aIrs. Rogers stood at-the hall door, holding it open 'for them as they reached home. She instantly seized Mattie, and dragged her up stais. Aunt Mary very wisely judged it would be best to leave them alone, and did not attempt to interrupt them. In about an hour, Mattiewith face and eyes all swollen, from weep- ing, came to her door, and throwing her arms about her neck sobbedl a lond like a punished child.  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7089-00000085"/> 168        CHESTNUT WOOD. Aunt Mary made no attempt to soothe her. She felt that the fault had been great, and was not now to be too easily ex- piated. As soon as Mattie could speak, she said:--- l4 Mother will not let me stay; she says I must go home with her to-morrow. Do, dear Aunt Mary, beg her for me. I can- not go back to -Hymeswold." ("Your mother is perfectly right," said Aunt Mary, sternly. "You have shown that you are unable to care for yourself. I do not wish any longer to have the responsibility of watching your conduct, away from your parents." '"I will never do so again, Aunt Mary, if you will forgive me only this once." "You should never have done so at all. - There must be something very wrong about you, or you could not have been so easily tempted. Mr. Atherton will not feel that you are any longer a fit companion for Sybil. Indeed you must go." There was something in the manner with which Aunt AMary pronounced these last few words, which told Mattie plainly, that her offence had been unpardonable, and she only sobbed the louder, without attempting one word of vindication; Aunt Mary allowed her to weep, until the sound of so much grief began to soften her own feelings towards her, then she said:- "Mattie, it is too late now, fobr any present repentance to avail you; you must prove to us all, that you can never do so foolish a thing again. Can you give me any reason for what you have done now?" "I never had any young gentleman to walk with me, or went to the play, as other young ladies do," sobbed Mattie," and I am sure I meant no harm." "If your tastes would allow you to associate with that low, vulgar young man, and to disobey your mother in order to do so, you certainly did harm, whether knowingly or not. This frivolity will ruin you yet."   CHESTNUT WOOD.         169 "But ir. Langdon visited at father's at home, and mother brought him here. I don't know what is low and vulgar about him." "If youdlo notfeel, it would be useless to try to explain to you. You must go home, where your mother can teach you better, anid fbr all our sakes, I will not mention this matter any further than is necessary to explain your going so suddenly, either to Mr. Atherton or Sybil; so, as it is your first fall, you may yet have an opportunity to redeem yourself. Go, now, and begin your preparations for departure." Every article that 5Mattie packed that night was wet with repentant tears; tears, the memory of which, fortunately for her, were never forgotten. Light and excitable by nature, without much clear insight into character, and little judgment, it were well for her, if the lesson which had been taught her friends, as well as herself; should be remembered. Mr. Atherton, when he was told of Mattie's expected return home, showed little surprise. He had, during their stay with him, become sufficiently acquainted with the character of his guests to wonder only that Mattie had been allowed to remain so long away from them; and although he expressed his regret, he did not attempt any very urgent measure for retaiing her in his family at present; though he by no means gave up the expectation of doing so at some future time. But it was far more difficult to make Sybil understand, and consent to it. She was so earnest and importunate in her re- quest to have her remain, that Aunt Mary, unused to deny her daring anythng she wished, and quite startled by Sybil's un- co1mmon pertinacity, almost gave up her own conviction of gi'ht, and determined to join in her request to 'have her remain. Nothing but the, remembrance that it would be a tacit deceit practised upon Mr. Atherton prevented her, and this kept her firm through all Sybil's tears and entreaties.

So Sybil desisted, but with a heart nearly as heavy as Mattie's herself; and not even Jerry's arrival, with a . full budget of news from Chestnut Wood, could make her for a moment forget it. It was the first time they had been parted for years, excepting during Mattie's occasional visits to the parsonage, and then, they had seen each other almost every day; now, weeks, if not months must pass, before they should meet again. How bitterly, as she drove away on the following day, Mattie regretted her fault; how willingly would she, by any means in her power, have obliterated the whole; but, alas! not easily can the thing once done be made to be as if ithad never been. Retribution! sooner or later, will find us out! Mattie made no very sage observation of this kind, as she went home. She sat, sullen and pouting, by the side of her mother; and Jerry often felt as he drove on, that this visit certainly . could not have been a very pleasant one to his minister and his. wife, for they were coming home cross! and to be ill-naturedi  was to him the worst possible state of mind; never induced, hle  felt, but by some positive calamity, and a calamity surely  ? enough had fallen upon the little parsonage of Hymeswold!  it {X                ori IX   CHAPTER IX. SYnJL missed Mattie even more than she bad anticipated. The music lessons lost much of their charm. She could not sing any of their favorite duets; she found she was disinclined to open her piano, and her painting became tedious. No mat- ter how pleasantly a young person maybe situated, they cannot really live without the society of those of their own age; and Sybil began to droop, visibly, when the time for Charles's vaca- tion again arrived, and a note to Aunt Blary announced his in- tention of spending it with them, in the city. He would be a very welcome   guest,--so they all felt; and many eager thoughts  followed him from his college home, on the day his' term ended. Of course, his reception was most cordial, and served effectually to banish all the little doubts and fears, which had clouded his own anticipations of the visit. Mr. Atherton met him as he always had, since the time of his fi st visit to Chestnut Wood ,-and was almost affectionate. Aunt 1Mary dearly loved him, and took no pains to conceal it; Sybil was kind, but quiet; bashful, and more pleased to listen to his con- rersation with others, than to converse herself; but this was natural, and soon wore off, so that, when her grandfather and Aunt AMary happened to leave them alone; they certainly lid not feel compelled to be silent. What had become of he difficulties which environed their friendship at Chestnut Wood? They had all gone, with the separation and change of  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7089-00000087"/> 172        - CHESTNUT WOOD.             /, place, and their young hearts rejoiced in the present and the ! future, almost without a cloud.               f What a never-ending source of entertainment and instruction ' the city affords? Every day, Mr. Atherton would plan sonlme walk or drive; some place to which Sybil must takle Charles ;  or, perhaps, he himself go with both; and as Charles -tad  [ 1neover been much in the city since he was a young boy, it was  all new and delightful to him. Days and weeks flew by; time  seemed doubly-winged; the holydays were almost ended, -   4 then, the books ian d ambition, again! After all, they were a I: sorry exchange for recreation and affection. The very thought }  of' the old gray college walls filled him with reluctance. He . would, just past boyhood as he then was, have been content to have life glide on an uninterrupted summer day. With Sybil, i-  what else could lie wish? But he had not yet learned to dis- ; cipline lhis own feelings. The world of love was one into which he had never knowingly entered; and all the dreams and fancies, which flitted so wildly through his brain, were but ? the phantasmagoria of some future state of existence,--a  beautiful spirit-land, where they two wandered, and were per- fectly happy. It was part of Mr. Atherton's plan, that they should be left . to the quiet development of their own feelings. He had hinted .; the same to Miss Rogers, and she fully coincided with -him. What could be more desirable or appropriate,--how happy   1 she should be, if the hlappiness of the two she loved best on earth could thus be made secure. No wonder that Sybil and  4 Charles, under such circumstances, should fee' that the weeks were passing only too rapidly away, and shrink from the hour which was so soon to separate them. Sybil, particularly, to : whom there remained neither name or fortune, the making of t which must necessarily occupy both thought and time. It is  no wonder that a young girl becomes so early a child of the l: affections.                        i   CHESTNUT WOOD.         173 Sybil was sittingcr alone, in the parlor, thinking how desolate she should be when Charles left, when a soft step caused her to look up, and she saw NTancy stealing, with her peculiarly cautious tread toward her. Nancy had been improving very rapidly in her housework, and had more than verified all Mrs. Giles's hopes of her. She was quick and faithful; little inclined to talk or meddle with the other servants, and yet always ready to aid allany of them whenever they seemed hurried, or to be particularly busy. She was, therefore, a favorite in the kitchen, no less than with the housekeeper; and had even attracted Mr. Atherton's ob- servation by her quiet and competent method of accomplishing her tasks. Sybil never ceased to watch and wonder over her, every time she came in contact with her, which was in reality as sel- dom as it could well be, when under the same roof. If- any one had noticed Nancy, they would have seen that she shrunk away, whenever Sybil entered a room where she was, and never answered her but in monosyllables. Sybil had, however, noticed that since Charles had been with them, Nancy had been more frequently in the parlor, and sometimes seemed to loiter, rather unnecessarily, over her work. She had observed this, because there seemed to be some spell about the girl which fascinated her; and which compelled her, whether she would or no, to make her the sub- ject of observation whenever she was near; now, therefore, sh:e watched her, uncertain what her object might be, when ANancy, after wandering around the room, hardly conscious what she was doing, suddenly darlted toward her, and throwincg a note down in her-lap, said -: "I was told to give you that. I am not to blame ; I would not have given it to you, if I could have helped it." Sybil took it up, examined it carefully, then said," who gave it to you?" 15*  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7089-00000088"/> 174        CHESTNUT WOOD. "Read it, and you will see. I will take back your an- swer, but don't blame me; you would not if you knew all." Sybil looked up, and caught such a flash from the dark eyes, that frightened she began to crush the note within her fin- gers. "Don't destroy it," said Nancy catching her hand; "read it. It is of importance, or I would not, let come to me what might, have given it to you." Sybil began to unfold it, and Nancy glided from the room. The writing was bold and business-like, and ran thus: "Sybil Thornton, you do not prove yourself much of a daughter. Are you so niggardly that you cannot spare a mite from your abundance for a starving father? Either you have failed in your promise, or the hand by which you were to trans- mit to me has proved false. At any rate I must have money. Nancy will bring it without fail. You can trust her; she is honest and good. Be. kind to her. You may save her yet. She has sinned more from misfortune than guilt. I will make her for the present, the means of my intercourse with you. Be- lieve nothing different from this, let whoever will inform you; and send aid for your dead mother's sake, to your father." The note dropped from Sybil's hands. "Again! again!" They were the only words she could utter. "It is too cruel, too thoughtless. Would that Charles had now gone!" And, as she looked up, Charles was standing beside her, his eyes filled with astonishment and wonder. "What do you mean? What can you be talking about, Sy- bil? Why do you wish me gone?  What has happened to you? Give me that note. I must read it!" "You cannot, Charles," said Sybil convulsively, crumbling it. It is something dreadful -something you must never know." "But, Sybil, I have a right, and must know;" and he at- tempted to take the crushed paper from her trembling hand.   CHESTNUT WOOD.         175 This endeavor startled her. Rising quickly and pushing him almost rudely away, she said:-- "Who has given you this right. You presume, Mr. Charles Wallace, and it were better for us both, that you desist imme- diately." "Charles's hand dropped as if palsied." "Enough, Sybil Thornton, I desist. Go your own way, but do not blame me if you are miserable." He strode from-the room, and Sybil heard the hall door close after him. She sprang to the window to recall him; it was too late; he was already gone! Mute and motionless she gazed after him, and then, when she could see him no longer, mechanically followed each person that appeared, until they were out of sight. I-ow long she stood there she knew not; but she was at last recalled by Nancy, who, coming close up to her, spoke to her several times before she received an answer; then with a sud- den start Sybil turned, and quiet and composed, as if nothing unusual had occurred, said gently:-- "Nancy, you may come to my room in an hour; I cannot attend to you now." Nancy made no answer, but turning, stole softly away, and Sybil immediately sought the solitude of her own chamber. There she re-read the note, and with a quickness of decision, com- mon to an excited mind, had, in a few minutes, resolved upon her whole future course of action. She would answer the note; inform her father where she had left the money which she had previously given him, and make a definite arrangement, by which lie should for the fu- ture receive from her, whatever she could save, without sub- jecting her to alarm or the danger of being suspected and mis- understood by 'those with whom she lived. She found it, how- ever, a more difficult matter than she had anticipated, to write the letter. Now the line which she had penned seemed cold i  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7089-00000089"/> 176         CHESTNUT WOOD. and formal, very different from what a daughter should send a father, and now she wished to erase an affectionate word which her truthful heart had never prompted; therefore, when Nancy, at the expiration of an hour, came to her door, Sybil still sat with her pen in hand, fearing to put the wandering un- certain thought upon paper. There was an expression of sym- pathy in Nancy's dark eyes, which, without her being conscious of it, aided and encouraged Sybil. Sit down, Nancy," she said in the same kind voice, "I will try to write quickly now; but I do not wish you to bring me any more notes; they trouble me." "I cannot refuse," said Nancy, and her voice sounded so shrill and sharp that it made Sybil start. "I must do as he tells me." Sybil made no reply, but again taking her pen, without giv- ing herself time to weigh her words, wrote and sealed her an- swer to her father. "Is this all?" asked Nancy. "Yes," answered Sybil; "what else would you have? He wishes money." "True! I had quite forgotten it; wait." Sybil eagerly emptied the contents of her purse into Nancy's hand; but when she had finished, Nancy did not withdraw it. "What more will you have?" asked Sybil. "More money; he will say, this is but a pittance, and he will trouble you again." It is all I have." "It will not satisfy him; he will send again." "What shall I do?" There was something in Nancy's firm tone, which made Sy- bii feel the dependance which her words implied. "Can you not get more?" "Yes, by asking my grandfather; but that I am not willing to do."   CHESTNUT WOOD.         1" "( Why not?" "Because I am sure he would not give for such an object, if he knew it." 6"But he does not know it." Sybil gave Nancy a searching glance. Nancy's eyes dropt instantly, but she did not color. "Learn at once, Nancy," said Sybil, still gently, 'that I never deceive. It is sufficient for me, that I know my grand- father would not give me money for this purpose." "Would he like better to see you troubled?" "He will not see me troubled. I shall tell him nothing of the matter, unless you, or those with whom you are connected, make it necessary ; then I shall not hesitate." Nancy now in her turn raised her eyes, and met fully those of Sybil fixed upon her; but they did not quail before the haughty girl, she said, and her voice seemed to have caught a little gentleness from Sybil's tones. "It is for your own sake, that I would have you send much money; I like not to see a young bird snared." "Thank you, Nancy, I feel that you mean kindly towards me, but-" Sybil stopped, and her voice trembled, as she said:- "I can suffer myself more easily than I can deceive those who trust me. I have no more money for you now, and cannot promise any. What I have given you must satisfy for the pre- sent; you can go with it." Slowly and very reluctantly, Nancy left the room, and Sybil, covering her face with her hands, remained buried in thought. The past, the present, and the future! who shall know in what a dread array they marshalled themselves before the heart of that young girl, learning, alas! so early in life, that the curse of sin shall fall even upon the third and fourth generation! The feelings with which Charles had left the house, certainly were not to be any more envied than those of Sybil. So un-  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7089-00000090"/> 178        CHESTNUT WOOD. interrupted had been the pleasure of his visit, that he was wholly unprepared for what had taken place. With the fresh- ness of youth, he had enjoyed each hour, as it had gone, nor even a shadow had flitted over him, reminding him of what he would like to forget in the past. Irritated and impatient, he walked with heedless steps along the street, and at last found himself, without being conscious of it, going swiftly along in the coun- try, in the direction of Charlton. Once he paused and loitered, as if uncertain which course to pursue, onward or return to the city; but the temptation to put distance of space between him- self and his trouble, was too great to resist; and again, without taking time to reflect upon the probable consequences, he left Mr. Atherton's house without making his departure known to him. His absence from the table was so uncommon, as to draw forth a comment from Aunt Mary; but Mr. Atherton was so prompt and punctual. himself, that it occasioned a slight shade of displeasure upon his brow; and had any one particu- larly noticed Sybil, they would have read in her face, both trou- ble and chagrin. When night came, and he. did not return, many anxious inquiries were made by all but Sybil, and the want of any expression of feeling on her part, first drew Aunt Mary's attention to her compressed lips, and heightened color. "Some lover's quarrel again," she said to herself, "strange, that so much sensitiveness is a necessary part of affection." Strange, Aunt Mary! She found herself pondering upon the mechanism of the human heart, and her conclusions proba- bly were those to which neither Sybil or Charles would then have been willing to subscribe. At night she sought Sybil in her room. She found her ex- cited and tearful, but with no confessions to make, at least, none which she seemed disposed to pour into her ear, so she took the opportunity, as she never failed to do, to convey to her a   CHESTNUT WOOD,         179 sense of the incapability of any earthly affection, however strong, to fill the place which God has designed only to occupy himself, and perhaps, to Sybil's trembling, agitated heart, the lesson came with a power which it had never brought before, and a feeling of utter helplessness, of dependance upon One who could direct as well as recognize every event of life. For the first time, since she wasta child, she knelt down by Aunt Mary's side, as she used to then, and looked up for her to ask for the woman as she did for the child, protection and -blessing. Aunt Mary's words were few, but earnest; and they sank with much of comfort and of rest into Sybil's troubled soul. The next morning, to the surprise of all, Charles was present at the breakfast table. He had returned with his fa- ther very early, and as nothing was said now, had probably seen, and apologized to Mr. Atherton. The latter was, how- ever, still grave and silent. It was difficult for him to forgive, even a slight offence, and Aunt Mary was obliged to sustain the conversation for all, nor did any one regret, when this the last meal Charles was to- take with them, before returning to college, was finished. The walk to Charlton had given Charles an excellent op- portunity to quiet the excitement of his mind and heart, and consequently he became more capable of looking calmly upon the event, which had just transpired. He had therefore determined before he had reached home, to return with his fa- ther, and demand from Sybil a full explanation of what had taken place. In vain in his ear, rang her words -"By what right ;" his heart obstinately claimed that it had a right; and he was in no mood for close investigation. He felt wronged, and therefore there was more of firmness and resolution, than of tenderness in his purpose; and unfortunately for them both, Sybil was in no mood to meet and answer to this. Following out his plans, he said to Sybil, while Aunt Mary was yet with them:--  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7089-00000091"/> 180        CHESTNUT WOOD. "Sybil, I should like to see you alone a few minutes, if you have no objection, before I go." Aunt Mary rose to leave the room, but Sybil immediately said, in a manner she very seldom used:- "Do not go, Aunt Mary, Charles can have nothing to say to me, which I should not prefer to have you hear." Charles looked from one to the other for a moment, as if un- decided what to do; but Aunt Maary saved him all further trouble, by immediately saying:-- "Really, Sybil, you forget that I may not like to stay, when so politely requested to go. Pray excuse me. I intend to be quite busy until just before Charles leaves, when I shall certainly come to say good-bye," and with an arch look, which did not tend to allay the irritation Sybil already felt, she left the room. "Sybil," said Charles, rising immediately as she did so, and seating himself by her side, ( I am going to leave you in an hour, and you certainly do not wish to part in unkindness." Sybil's lip pouted, but she made no reply. "If I thought, Sybil, you really did not care," continued Charles, a little touched," I would go without another word of explanation; but I am sure we shall both regret when too late to help it, and my whole next college term will be haunted by the memory." Still no answer; and when Charles spoke again it was to say, "Sybil Thornton, I will not be trifled with. I must know what is the meaning of your strange conduct. I have borne with you until one more act or word which I do not understand, and you will not condescend to explain, will almost drive me mad. I demand to know why today you are so gentle and kind to me, and to-morrow you wish me away, an  m and become angry with me on the slightest pretext, and look so agitated and trou- bled. Why do you start, and change color, and tremble, and seem almost guilty, you, Sybil Thornton, who are as good and as pure and as innocent as the angels above! Why, I ask, why?"   CHESTNUT WOOD.         181 "Because," answered Sybil, still with the haughty curl upon her lip, " it is my pleasure. Have you anything more to ask?" "Yes; and you must answer me. 'It is your pleasure!  Mark me, Sybil, each one of those words are burned into my heart. I am no longer a boy," and Charles rose and stood in his growing manhood before her. "From a little child, from that cold dark night " "Stop, Charles Wallace," said Sybil, interrupting him; "I may as well put an end to this conversation now, as when some- thing has been said which perhaps I shall like still less to hear. If it will save you a regret, if it will take from the memory of what you call my ' unkindness, know that there is a mystery about which neither you or any other living being has a right to question me, and that any attempt on your part to do so will only bring sorrow and separation. Are you answer- ed?" "Yes, but not satisfied. I would know all, Sybil." "You never can; and any effort to learn gives me more pain than you would willingly inflict." There was a softened tone in Sybil's voice, which Charles quickly felt. "Sybil, I would die rather than give you pain." "Can you trust me, then, Charles?" "Trust you? Yes, with all the world but yourself. But to see you unhappy, and to suspect what I have to suspect." "What is that?" and Sybil raised her eye clear and calm and fixed it inquiringly upon him. His own fell in a moment. "I should insult you were I to tell you." "Why think it of me, then?" "Because it was forced upon me. Because I saw with my own eyes and heard with my own ears. Because," and Charles really shuddered, " when I am away from you many things haunt me, like visions of a troubled dream. Sybil, I entreat, for our future, that you tell me all now." VOL.

"Go, Charles," said Sybil, and her voice had lost all its ten- derness, " you do not trust me; you are unmerciful, you are unkind. You drive me to desperation when you ought to calm and quiet me. Go, now, I have not another word to say." "And this is our parting, Sybil?" "Blame me not!  Learn to trust, or forget me, Charles." Sybil covered her face with her hands, and her frame shook convulsively. Charles stood regarding her attentively; and within his breast jealousy, suspicion, and suspense waged fierce war with affection and confidence. A moment more and the question would have been forever settled, but a figure had entered the room, and was moving noiselessly around it. He looked up and met one sharp inquiring glance from Nancy's dark eyes. Its power over him was immediate. Without trusting himself to look again at Sybil, he slowly left the room, and left behind him all the sunshine of his young heart. When the hour of his leaving came, Sybil stood with dry eyes but a flushed cheek, with the little group who had gathered to say "farewell;" and Nancy, like a ghost, glided around, and with unwonted officiousness made herself busy in the last pre- parations necessary for a departure. No one seemed to notice her, yet all felt that she was there, and recalled her behavior with feelings of surprise afterward- all but Sybil, and to her quickened imagination Nancy was al- ready becoming a type of evil, a dark shadow that fell upon her path.   CHAPTER X. SOON after Mattie's unexpected return to the country, Mr. Atherton had sent down to her a piano, and thereby had most pleasantly settled the often vexed question, as to how one was to be procured, and surely never was a gift more acceptable, both to Mattie and her parents. Time hung very heavily upon Mattie's hands, suddenly cut off from her regular occupations and amusements, with no one but a few country girls for companions, and nothing to see but occasionally a farmer, or at best a farmer's cart pass the house, she became after the first few days of her residence at home listless and restless to a degree that vexed and troubled her mother, and even annoyed her more quiet father. "Matilda," said her mother to her one morning, and her mother never called her Matilda unless she was about to find fault with her, "I am tired to death of seeing you mope about the house in this way, and if you can't find anything to do yourself, I will provide you with occupation without any moru delay." Mattie was sitting in the only rocking chair in the room, looking busily at vacancy, and of course with a most vacant ex- pression to her face. She started now and looked at her moth- er instead, but showed no inclination to answer her, or offer any apology for her idleness. Mrs. Rogers had been, with all the careful instinct of a moth- er, narrowly observing Mattie since her return from the city,  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7089-00000093"/> 184        CHESTNUT SWOOD. and had been aware, as she had said frequently to her hus- band, that she must " turn over a new leaf" with her, still so far she had not the courage needed for the assault. She tried every way to make home pleasant to her, to woo her to household duties,'and to make an exertion to entertain them, but- Mattie, if she assisted her at all in the daily work, did so with a carelessness and impatience which was a sore trial to the neat, order loving mother, and most of her conversation con- sisted in monasyllabic answers to their questions. Mrs. Rogers had been both hurt and grieved, and no one was more power- less to make an attack than herself' under such circumstances; but this morning she had been vexed by such continued ill be- havior, and the awakening of a little temper always made her most eloquent, therefore now Mattie's silence only added fuel to the flame, and, putting down the sewing which she held in her hand, she continued:-- '"There is no use in your looking cross, or taking any kind of airs upon yourself, for I am determined that I will have this no longer. Here you have been at home three weeks, and I should like to know the first thing you have done? You have never offered to sweep a room, or cook a meal, or wash a dish; but I should not care so much for that, if you ever sewed or read. Once in a great while you have made a pretence of fixing up some laces, or something of that kind, but what has it amounted to? A week ago I saw you with a book in your hand. I don't know what it was; but I dare say one of which neither your Aunt Mary or your father would approve, for I saw you hide it away when he came in. And even all this I could forgive, if you would take a little pains to make yourself agreeable to the people when they come in. But not you. You take no more notice of them than you would of so many trees; and when they speak to you, you have a snappish way of answering them, which it would not at all surprise me if in the end cost your father his place."   CHEISTNUT WOOD.         185 Mrs. Rogers's voice now began to tremble. It was dangerous ground for her, that of her husband and his connection with his flock; and Mattie might have taken advantage of this melt- ing moment if she had seen fit, but she was obdurate, and still preserved an unbroken silence; so after a few tears shed over the possibility of the separation, Mrs. Rogers cleared her voice and continued: "' There is one thing to which I have entirely made up my mind; that is, that all of' this- shall go on no longer. You shall do something; and you may drop your fine lady airs and become what you are, a poor minister's daughter, as soon as you please. You shall wash and iron, and sweep and dust, and make shirts, until you lose your cross face for want of having time to make it up in." This last was a master stroke of Mrs. Rogers, and forgetting her husband's absence, she looked around for his approving smile; but she only saw a vexed quiver, on Mattie's lip, and with an almost irresistible inclination, she started from her chair to go and shake her as she used to do when she saw the same expression of concealed temper in the child. Mattie perhaps recognized the movement, and recollected the operation, for habit made her readjust her lips immediately, and a nearer approach of her near sighted mother to her grown and handsome daughter, at-the same time recalled to her mind the difficulty of reaching and benefiting her with that kind of moral suasion; so she did, what was always her last resort, fall to weeping aloud, in a most convulsive manner. AIattie bore it just as lone as her sour feelings could combat with her kind heart, then in a half sulky, half apologetical tone, she said: - "What do you want me to do, mother? I don't see any use in your crying away at that rate; one would think either father, or the whole parish had suddenly died, to hear you." An unkind daughter," sobbed out poor Mrs. Rogers. 16*  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7089-00000094"/> 186        - CIESTNUT WOOD. "Mother, you know better, you know I am not unkind; but I am bored to death,. by living in this mean little country town." "Mean little country town! Matilda Rogers, I am mortified to death. Suppose any of the people should hear you say so. I wish, from my heart I do, that I had never consented to your going to New York, or even to Chestnut Wood. I wish most sincerely I had always kept you at home, and at work, so that you might know your place, and not talk about being ' bored to death' by living at home, with your own parents." "I did not say at home, mother, but here in Hymeswold." "And what is the difference, Hymeswold and your father and mother, are one and the same." "I did not know that before," said Mattie, with an arch look, which clearly indicated coming sunshine in the troubled sky. "You are pretty good size, mother, and would do to represent the ladies better than my father, who is decidedly the thinnest man within ten miles round." "I am in no mood for trifling, Matilda;" but the sunshine was nevertheless rather contagious. "What I want is a change in your whole course of conduct, turning over a new leaf, be- coming what a daughter, and a minister's daughter ought to be." C And pray what sort of an animal is that?" Mrs. Rogers wisely took no notice of the lightness of' this remark, but continued her requirements in a tone and manner which might be said to have caught some of its tricks from the worthy minister himself; this Mattie recognized, for suddenly interrupting her mother, she said:-- "And now, lastly, mlother." !"Well, lastly then," said her mother, whose temper was all spent, and consequently her duty done. "Lastly is, thlat you become my own, good, only daughter." "Your own, and your only, I don't see how I can very well avoid being; but the good is another, and I am sorry to say,   CHESTNUT WOOD.          187 quite different matter. You must make more allowance for me. Don't you think it is any change to leave Broadway, and concerts, and sight seeing, and music, and drawing, and painting, and come here, with absolutely nothing to do, and nothing to see? I am sure I should be a very uncommon somebody, if I was not stupid and dull, and I dare say half of' the time cross. If I only had a piano, and could once in the while play and sing, it would be a great comfort to me. How shall I ever be able to own. one. I wish I had never learned to play, for then I should not miss it." "Your father intends writing to Mr. Atherton, to ask where, and for what, he can purchase you one. You know he is very indulgent, Mattie, and there is nothing in the world, he will not do to make you happy, when he can, so I really think it is only right in you, to make a sacrifice sometimes for him." "But, mother, father cannot afford to buy me a piano. They cost many hundred dollars." "Perhaps Mr. Atherton might tell him where to buy a second hand one, cheaply. He will write and ask." "I would rather never have a piano," said Mattie, with much indignation, "' to the end of my life. Mr. Atherton never buys a second hand or a cheap thing, and to ask him about them, would be the same as asking him to give me one. I really do hope father will do no such thing; I had rather never own a piano." "Your father, I should imagine, Matilda, would know what is proper and right, as well as yourself; but you seem fond of making objections, to- whatever is proposed, and it will not hurt you to wait for your piano, until you are in a more amiable state of mind. You may now sew up this long seam in this sheet, and I shall expect to find it all done before it be time to help nme prepare the dinner." Mattie knew very well, that when her mother spoke as she did now, she intended to be obeyed; she went immediately  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7089-00000095"/> 188        CHESTNUT WOOD. to bring her work basket, and looked so demure and patient, as she began to ply the needle, that her mother's heart quite chid her, with the fear that she might have spoken unkindly, when she only intended to be decided. As may well be supposed under these circumstances, the arrival of a fine musical instrument as a present from nMr. Atherton, and that too, without the letter of inquiry having been sent, to annoy Mattie by the feeling, that it had been, even in- directly solicited, was a very welcome event to all. Mrs. Rogers rubbed it carefully after it was unboxed, until she found that she made herself much work by the tears which she dropped upon it, as she bent her eyes closely to it, to be sure no grain of dust marred its bright surface. Mr. Rogers surveyed its appearance first from one parlor door, and then from another, to make sure that it stood in pre- cisely the spot from which it would look most imposingly at the people as they should enter; then with a quiet shrug of satis- faction, endeavored to suppress the feeling of worldly pride, which it certainly did call fbrth in his chastened heart. Poor man! it was a hard struggle, particularly as in its very midst, Mattie commenced playing, in  a manner of which any parent might be proud. It was a new hour in the little parson- age of Hymeswold; that in which music broke upon its long, dull monotony, and came with its enlivening and refining power, to wake up its silent echoes, and stir into new life, the slow pulses, which had beacn so sluggishy for years. After Mattie had played and sung an hour or two, Mrs. Rogers attired herself in' a holiday dress, and wore her cap with its briYghtest pink ribbons. She felt younger, and more active, but nDever troubled herself to inquire why, and Mr. Rogers, when the lid of the piano was closed, instead of looking idly over the columns of an already oftentimes scanned newspaper, went to his study, and really selected the text for a new discourse. It brought however with it so great a feeling of juvenility, of como b  -- -- --- -- ------e   CHESTNUT WOOD.         189 nmencing life again, that he felt almost ashamed of it, and took some pains to put it out of his wife's siglt, far under the pile of old sermons, which after all, were the staunch friends not to be so easily fobrsaken. And so the gift of the piano to the minister's family, was a source not only of much pleasure but of good, for no where in the whole world is there a family where impulse is needed more than in that of a quiet country minister, his very position de- barring both himself and family, from that unrestrained inter- course with others, which in almost every other case, supplies material for excitement and variety.  If the rich who give, and give generously, to provide for bodily wants, would sometimes remember the wants of the pinched and starving tastes, that part of our human nature which runs through the mind and heart with threads of purest gold, beautifying and polishing it all, and would out of their abun- dance, spare the choice picture firom their elegant drawing rooms, to hang beside the study table on the low walls of some country parsonage, many a mind whose native powers have never from the circumstances of their daily life, been able to hold commu- nion with the great and beautiful in art, might become itself in turn its creator, and thus, repay tenfold, even in kind, the good conferred. A fine thought, sometimes starts out from canvas, with life and power vastly superior to that by which it was suggested, and the cold and silent marble is breathed upon with subtler than Promethean fire. Mr. Atherton, in all probability, did not pass through this train of' thought, nor was his desire to cultivate the taste of either Mr. or Mrs. Rogers, an inducement to send the piano into their house; but he had always intended to present one to Mattie, so soon as it should be decided that she was no longer to remain an -inmate of his family, and this was now settled, at  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7089-00000096"/> 190        'CHESTNUT WOOD. least so Mrs. Rogers's letter written to Aunt Mary, sometime after ;MSattie's return home, announced, and the quiet, and seemingly well satisfied manner in which Aunt Mary heard the news, first suggested to Mr. Atherton the probability that there might be some good reason for it, which had not been made known to him. Sybil was annoyed at the quiet way in which they both heard the decision, and was at first quite im- portunate that they should use all their influence at the parson- age to have it repealed. But her grandfather said: "Of  course, he should not feel at liberty to interfere with Mattie's parents ; " and Aunt Mary promised to ask that, at some future time, Mattie might be allowed to visit them; but for the present,. a frequent correspondence must take the place of any closer intimacy. Therefore, the letter which went to Mattie after this conversation, was as full of regrets and affection as even Mattie's loving heart required. Her mother wondered which had pleased her most, the letter or the piano; and certainly it would have been a difficult point to have decided, for Mattie had brought away from Mr. Ather- ton's such a consciousness of ill-desert, such a feeling of her own unworthiness to be the companion of Sybil, that she almost feared that Sybil would be as conscious of it as she was her- self, and really dislike her. She had prepared herself for alienation and coldness; and often, when she seemed to her mother to be but idly dreaming, conscience was doing its work by filling her mind with silent upbraidings and regrets; and now, before the loving words of Sybil's letter, it was astonish- ing how quickly the monitor ceased to be heard, and with what renewed life and happiness she began really to interest herself in the things about her. Her mother did not know to which of the three things to ascribe 'it, -whether it was the " new leaf" she had "' turned over," or the piano, or that long, long letter. Perhaps the   CHESTNUT WOOD.          191 charm lay in them all; and so, after much needless discussion, she at last decided, and was well satisfied to see the sun be- ginning to shine once more within the little parsonage. Mattie now became a frequent, and always a very welcome visitor among the parish. She accompanied her father to make his ministerial calls, or with her little work-basket in her hand dropped socially in to take tea, where she thought any pros- pect of amusement offered. She went often to see Dinah, and endeavored, though rather timidly, to fill the vacant place which Sybil's absence left in the old negro's heart. It was on her return from one of these visits that she met Jerry, and was induced by him to take a drive to Chestnut 'Wood. His waggon already held Miss Palmy, but what mat- tered that; -Dobbin was used to much heavier loads ; and Jerry could himself occupy the least possible space, only so he made "it convenient to the ladies."  Palmy was going on one of her monthly foraging expeditions, during which she generally man- * aged to free the house so entirely of dust and spiders, that even 1Mrs. Giles herself would have been well satisfied.  She liked Mattie as well as she could like anything that was young and full of life, and was really glad to have her go with hef into that great desolate house, so desolate, that she was filled with her " little tremblings," and started often, only at the noise her own footsteps made. It would be pleasant to have some one to speak to; to know that there was somebody there who could constantly see where she could not, behind her' own back, that would be the greatest relief; so she ventured an un- usual number of remarks, much to Jerry's astonishment and pleasure. He could not forbear saying, as he drew up before the hall door :- "A mighty nice ride we have had of it, now, haven't we, Miss Palmy?" to which direct interrogation the lady was  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7089-00000097"/> !9)'92       CHESTNUT WOOD. obliged to answer in the affirmative; though it as rather against her principles to acknowledge anything was pleasant. TMaIlt!,3 elld not been to Chestnut Wood since her return firom the city, now nearly six months ago; and sihe wandered ,around the large lonely rooms with a sadder feeling than she had almost ever known before. How filled with memories of the past they all were! This room she had occupied with Sybil; here was the bureau, just where it used to stand; there, her little rocking chair, by what she had always called her window; and Sybil's was also standing by hers. Even the toys, with which the days of their happy childhood had been amused, were put away by Aunt MAary, with that jealous care with which she guarded every memento of the past.  In the closet, still hung the little dresses which they had worn, when they used to be dressed exactly alike; every thing re- nained untouched, inviolate. Mattie's two lives had been so distinct, that she now easily passed out from the present, and lived over again that with Sybil, in the same way that we often recall a dream; vividly, it may be, but so wholly unconnected with what is now passing around us, that we require some voucher for its truth. iMattie must linger again in the school-room. She inclined with that desire, which we all so often experience, to torment ourselves, to stay longest where her days and hours had been happiest; and then, in spite of her efforts to suppress them, large tears gathered, and rolled down her cheeks. She was sitting by herself, when Miss Palmy, who had been disappoint- ed in not having any one to take care of her back, reached this room in the course of' her surveys, and very much to her amazement found Mattio here and in tears. She involuntarily dropped her little courtesy, and was about to go back, when seeming to rememeber that she had only come in the prosecu- tion of her lawful business, she lifted her broom somewhat sig-    cHES'rTNUT WOOD.        193 nificantly as her badge of office, and making great efforts not to appear to notice A{attie, while in truth she was watching her with a lynx's eye, she began to investigate most carefully tle condition, first of the walls, and particularly of the corners of the room. "Just let me look at that chair, if you please, Miss!" slie said, in her sharp voice, after having carefully dusted every other article in the room. Mattie mechanically moved away, and then first became con- scious that she was really in tears. Now, perhaps, there was no one exhbition of feeling of which sihe had so much dread, as of this. From her childhood, the fiequent bursts of tears in which her mother had indulged, had been to her a source of mortification, and she had learned, even before most children would to control this very natural exhibition. Her mother had often called and thought her ureeling; and even her father, whose pale blue eyes were so easily suffused with moisture, wondered at the stoicism of his little girl. Therefore, when  Mattie becamle conscious thalt there must be really traces of' tears visible to Miss Palmy's peering, eyes, she began to talk and laugh in a  manner much more disconcerting than her grief had been. Her voice sounded so shrilly in tlat uninhabited house, it seemed as if every word she spoke must be heard, perhaps, in Hymeswold; so Miss Palmy  worked with even more than her usual despatch, to have the business through, and be once more out of those doors. The library was always the last room which she visited. 'There was sometlinLg in the presence of those books and silent pictures, particularly the portrait, which awed her with a super- natural feeling, almost amounting to terror. "Please to come in here, 1liss!" she said, as she saw 2M attie about to pass that door; " I never saw such a large room, with so many little scarey places in it; I always have feelings when I   am here."

"Do you, Miss Palmy?" answered Mattie in a tone of mock gravity; " well, if I thought I should, I should love dearly to go in by myself, and find out how they would seem." ' They are not pleasant, Miss!" said Miss Palmy, with a little tremble. How Mattie's merry laugh rang back from the well-stored alcoves, as she pushed open the door. Miss Palmy started as if the rosy lips of the portrait had answered, and really shrank from entering the room; but an exclamation of surprise from Mattie, drew her quickly in. Mattie was standing beside a new portrait, which, during her many visits, shed never remembered to liave seen before. It was hanging on a nail, opposite that occupied by the one which had seemed the spirit of the room, to Palmy; and though younger, and perhaps fairer, bore so striking a resemblance to it, that it seemed as if it must be the same face, only taken at an earlier period of life. "How like, and yet how unlike," said AlIattie, as she stood turning quickly from one to the other, comparing them. "The very same eyes and hair, but what a different mouth; that looks all sweetness and kindness ; but this,- see, Miss Palmy, this is very like Air. Atherton's, when he is displeased, and has made up his mind that everything shall be done just as he says. I have seen him look so at Sybil, when we were chllil- dren and she wanted to have her own way about something to whichh he objected; and the more I look at it, the more exactly it looks like him. There, now, " changing her position, "1 I can see Sybil, when she is a little vexed, and shakes back her curls, and tosses up her head; see there, the very curve of the neck, and the same beautiful shoulders,-- who can it be? I wonder if it is Sybil's mother, and if it is, and Mr. Atherton has always owned it, why he has never hung it here before; the frames are just alike, and so are the places in which they hang. I do wish I knew what it all means?"   CHESTNUT WOOD.         195 "I am sure I can't tell you," said Miss Palmy, approaching and examining the frame very carefully. I do n't believe it was ever hung up before, for only see the dust. Mrs. Giles has not dusted it these five years, I am sure." "It is a beautiful face," said Mattie, without noticing what Miss Palmy had been saying; I never saw one that fascinated me more; and yet it is not half as fine as Sybil's." "Much handsomer, I think," said Miss Palmy with some as- perity; "Sybil Thornton is too pale a beauty to please me. She is nothing but red and white." "Coleur de rose," repeated Mattie; ," certainly nothing to be complained of, especially by people as dark as you and I, Miss Palmy." Palmy tossed her head, and before her mental eye passed the vision which she sometimes saw in that large mirror at home; she made no reply, and commenced dusting, but it was now her turn to exclaim, and Mattie's to run to discover for what. "Mercy on me! what does this mean!" she said, stopping suddenly before Mr. Atherton's private case of drawers. "Do look at these papers; what a terrible fluster they are in!" Mattie had approached, and stood looking at this unwonted appearance of disorder, with quite as much of surprise in her face, as Miss Palmy's evinced. "Mr. Atherton never did it," she said; " either Jerry has been sent here for something, and has forgotten to replace them, or some one has broken into the house." "Mr. Goldsmith never left a  thing out of order in his life," said Miss Palmy briefly. "Well then, some one has broken in; for see! every drawer has been broken open, and every bundle of papers untied. This is empty, and this, and this, and this!"--continued Mat- * tie, opening and shutting the drawers hastily --- and I know that Mr. Atherton always kept them filled, for I have seen him come and open  them a great many times, when I was a child,  &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7089-00000099"/> 196        CHESTNUT WOOD. and I always wondered what so many papers could have in them; but I never dared to ask, neither did Sybil. And see here! here they are crammed into this lower drawer. DIid you ever see such a sight! Red tapes and all! What will Jerry say-?" This last question .was quite suggestive, for Miss Palmy speed- ily disappeared, and returned in an incredibly short time with Jerry. He stopped before the portrait, as if there was something in the face which had changed him into stone; nor did he utter one word, until Mattie had drawn him away to the rifled secretary. Wlhen his eyes fell upon the papers, and Mattie pointed to the confused drawer, he knocked his cap quickly from one side of his head to the other, and ejaculated:- "Now, I say for 't, if that don't beat all natur!' "Did you do it, Jerry?" asked Mattie. "I! why I should as soon have thought of burning up the house, and running away by the light of it, as of touching this clhest of drawers, and for the pictur!" Jerry glanced backl at it. "Well, I am beat up and can't say a word!" "Some one broke in then," continued Mattie, whose astonish- ment having had more tinme to subside, made her ready to in- vestigate the affair. "Sartain as the world; if they did not, how did they get in? I should just like to know that, for the keys hav'n't so much as been off the hook up in my bed-room at Miss Palmnay's, ex- cept I took them, since M3r. Atherton went away."' "Then let us find out how they got in?"  "Sure enough, I am so knocked up, I seem to have lost all my sense; " and forthwith Jerry commenced a careful exami- nation of every part of the house. But he might well say that he had lost his sense, for the most probable places, the long win- ,-  dows of the library, were the very last things, at which he looked.   CHESTNUT WOOD.         1' Here lie found a window unlocked; and upon closer exami nation, that a pane of glass had been removed, through which a lhand could easily reach the fastening, over the window. The glass had been slipped back into its place, but fel: upon the slighltest pressure; and now, of course, there remainec lno doubt, as to the unlawful entrance of the visitorl. Jerry had been too confounded by the unexpected occurrence, to give vent to the usual number of expletives, with which he generally graced such an occasion. There was a look of dis may about his large blue eyes, which made him very interest- ing to Miss Palmy. Whenever he did speak, it was to utter some word or sen- tence of self-accusation. HHe could not divest himself of the feeling, that if' he had been more vigilant, all this need not have happened, and it quite moved Miss Palmy's sympathy, to hear him blame himself, for what even the greatest stretch of her imagination could not attach to him. "If they had only taken the silver!" he suddenly broke out with- "That has gone to the city," suggested Mattie. "Sartain, so it has. Well, if they had taken'them are books, or the -furniture, or anything but them papers. Why who knows," continued Jerry in a tone which implied tlht the w0hole extent of the loss was just dawning upon him.

Jerry moved toward the picture; but both Miss Palmy and MAattie detained him. - "Don't touchl it for your life," gasped out Miss Palmy. It may be -red hot, and burn all the skin off your hands."   CHESTNUT WOOD.         199 "Let it alone, until Mr. Atherton sees it," said Mattie. '"That's proper," answered Jerry, removing his hands at once from it. HHe must know all about it, and the sooner the better. I have heard him say, he wasn't much in fa- vor of fiee trade, and this is trade of the freest kind, I sliould think." The three now carefully re-examined every part of the house, to make sure there had been no farther depredations committed, and having satisfied themselves, that this was all, they, proceeded to make fast with double care, and then to look around the garden and grounds contiguous to the house. It was early spring, and the new grass was just beginning to show its little green head above the dead leaves which had formed so warm a covering for it, through the firost and snows of winter. Every recent print upon it, would be as easily seen as a mark upon the wet sand; but fiar and near, no violence seem- ed to have approached it, for every tiny blade lifted itself up, as if already it rejoiced in the existence so happily begun. Jerry's keen eye easily saw that any visitor must have come some weeks before, yet it certainly had been within a month, for as true as the almanac, was always Jerry's visit on the same day of every month. Some few particulars, Jerry had. fixed upon as certain, be- fore he left Chestnut Wood. One was, that the rogue was no common man; another, that his object was not plunder, and the third, that Mr. Atherton would be both troubled and vexed. He was so busy in deciding what was the best thing, to be done, at once without waiting to consult his master, that he became very inattentive to both Miss Palmy and Mattie; and Mattie hinted several times in vain, that as they did not seem  likely to make any new discoveries by staying, perhaps it would be better that they should go home before he seemed to recollect that he had anything to do with their  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7089-00000101"/> 200         CHESTNUT WOOD. transportation; and when Dobbin was brought around, and they were fairly on their way, he returned such absent and sing ular answers to all of AIattie's questions, that at last she too was silent, and a very quiet ride ]home they made of it. Whlen they reached the door of the parsonage, Jerry said in a whisper to Mattie:-- "I have been thinking on't, 1Miss Mattie, and I rather think if you keep sort of silent about this matter, it will answer iMr. Atherton's purpose best. If I were you, I don't think I would say a word about it, not even to your father and mother. M r. Atherton is a very close-mouthed sort of a man, and don't like his affairs talked about, any how you can fix it. So, Miss Iat- tie, it will oblige me, too, if you \will make a secret out of' it." "And Miss Palmy," said Iattie, glancing with a roguish look back into the wagfon, "'I'll lock her up so you could n't even screw a word out her," said Jerry, winking, his eye in his most comical manner, a look which the minister caught as he had opened the door to speak to the two parishioners, and which, together with, the whisper, the sound of which had also reached his car, filled him with many conjectures not altogether pleasant, but which were too vagLue to allow him to seek his customary solace, by slaring them with his wife. HEIe asked Mattie many indirect questions in order to allrrive at something, but of course found them all destined to receive an evasive answer. IMattie would liked to lhave told her father and mothler. Tllere was somletling very ludicrous to her in the way ill whllch they received uncommon news ; and it was only the fear of TM1r. Athherton's displeasure wh'ich withheld hll er; but she could not forbear dropping now and then a hnt sufficient to keep her father's mind in its state of half perplexity. Jerry had never been in a greater quanda ry than when,   CHESTNUT W"OOD.        201 Miss Pallly deposited at her own door and the last thing done bor Dobbin for the night, he found himself called to decide upon what should be next. There was little doubt but he must go to New York himself, and acquaint :Mr. Atherton with what had taken place; but in the mean time, who could he leave who would prove a sufficient guard for the house at Chest- nut Wood. He thoucght over every trusty man within twelve miles, but no sooner did lie decide to go and try to procure him, than a thousand reasons for not doing so seemed immedi- ately to suggest themselves; and for not the first time in his life, he had a great desire for ubiquity, that he might be in two different places at the same time. At last lie settled the matter by determining to keep the se- cret himself, as well as to try to enfbrce secrecy upon others, and to hurry down to New York, and then of course having once told his nmaster, the responsibility belonged to him no long- er. It was a very busy time upon the farm ; but that mattered little. He would just call and speak to one of his head work- ers, and everything else must wait the settling of this more important matter. So early the next morning, long before any other person was awake in Hymeswold, Jerry, in a most un- comfortable state of mind, was on his way to New York. He had many fears that Mr. Atherton would consider him as hav- ing been negligent in his duty; and he had himself a feeling that li]C mnight have been ; though how he could have prevented ;    liat liad now happened, he could not exactly comprehend. As     the distance between himself and the city diminished, his fears i    increased, and by the time he reached the street in which Mr. ?I    Atherton lived, he would hardly have felt mere guilty had he i    been the housebreaker himself.      Mattie, as she was forbidden to speak to any one else, could not resist an inclination to- go and discuss the matter with Miss Palmy. But, poor Mattie! she might as well have under-  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7089-00000102"/> 202        CHESTNUT WOOD. taken to hold a conversation with her goose, for Jerry seemed literally to have executed his threat, and to " have locked up her mouth, so that a sound should ever escape it again. She only replied in monosyllables to Mattie, and then, after eacll one, would look over her shoulder, as if in very truth she ex- pected to see Jerry looking reprovingly at her. Mattie soon became tired of this sport, and very recklessly left Miss Palmy to go alone, on what she told her was to be a "'voyage of discovery" to Chestnut Wood. Miss Palmy was so astonished at the boldness of the pro- posal, that she turned really pale, and opened her mouth Withl so voluble a protest, that Mattie, hoping the seal had been re- moved, was half tempted to give up her wild plan and remain where she was; but having eased her mind, Miss Palmy once more relapsed into silence, and Mattie started for her long and lonely walk. Mattie was not really as bold as she had ap- peared, and had many secret misgivings as to the proprietyr of her, undertaking; but there was something in the very ter- ror withl which it seemed to inspire Miss Palmy, which made her now ashamed to relinquish it; so summoning all her cour- age, she tripped on in the direction of Chestnut Wood, hurning snatches of lively songs to herself' as she went.   CHAPTER XI. A WALK in the country is generally solitary enough, even when a person is bound upon business which occupies the mind pleasantly; but when the errand is one, the performance of which is accompanied with anxiety, the silence and monotony become at times almost painful. So Mattie, after she had left the village fairly behind her, found it this morning. The air was filled with the sounds of awakening life, and nature, like a gentle, loving friend, stood ready all around to bear her companionship but Mattie had not that genuine sen- sibility which ever made her delight in its quiet communion, and the birds sang to her from off the fiesh budding branches, and the little insects twittered and chirped in all the joy of a newly begun existence, without awakening one sympathetic chord within her bosom. It was emphatically a glad spring morning; and had some one pointed out its beauties to her, Mattie might perhaps have felt less alone, but of herself she would never have had a consciousness of their existence. When she reached that part of the road bordered on both sides by woods, she became really timid; and this was so new a feel- ing, that for a time she almost amused herself with its novelty. She laughbed merrily after she had started at the scampering march of' any old rabbit, more intent on collecting its fresh food than fearful of the young girl, or when she fobund herself lis- [  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7089-00000103"/> 204        CHESTNUT WOOD. tening nervously to the distant sound of wheels. An old black cow emerged suddenly from behind a little thicket, and she turned in much haste to retrace her steps towards tHymeswold, nor dared to look behind her until ca gentle lowing informed her that her companion was not of human kind, and gave her courage to proceed on her way. When she came to the path that branched off toward old Dinah's, she easily persuaded herself that a call first upon the negro would only delay her a short time from reaching Chest- nut Wood, and that Dinah seemed so glad to see her wlhen she was there .the previous day, that it would be quite a pity if she should not go again; so she turued in the direction of her house. Dinah's reception of her was quite unexpected. "Oh, lMiss. Mattie,"  she said, as she saw her enter, "The blessed Lord has surely sent you -today. Praise his lholy name. He never fobrgets old Dinah." "What is the matter; Dinah?" asked Mattie. "Nothinrg the matter with old nigger, for sure; but little Missis, I have been thinking and praying for her all night long." "Sybil, why what of her?" and Mattie's tone changed to one of real anxiety. "Site left it there, under the brass candlestickl," said Dinabh pointing to her shining mantel ornament, "and now it's gone." "Left what, Dinah?" "It - I don't know what." When did she leave it?" Dinah had so far spoken with uncommon lucidness; but the eager face and quick questions of Ilattie began already to con- luse her; so she said again:-- "I do n't know, do n't know." ' She has not been down here for six months or more, has she, Dinah?" said Mattie, speaking slowly and gently.   CHESTNUT WOOD,          205 "Six months," repeated Dinah, but with less wandering of the eye. "Yes, full six months; so it must be sometime since she put it there. Was it large, or small?" u Under the candlestick," answered Dinah. Mattie examined the large flat-bottomed candlestick, and per- ceived that the small hollow just below the stick could not con- tain anything very large. Having satisfied herself on this point, she asked;- "Who took it away -did you?" "Little Missis put it there," answered Dinah, evidently com- ing back to the point from which she had started. "' And who took it away?" asked Mattie again. "A man," said Dinah unhesitatingly. 6A man!" and Mattie's start undid all her soft tones had accomplished. ( "Who was it?" "A man," mechanically repeated Dinah. "So you said before; but was he tall or short, old or young? Was it any one you know? Does he live in Hymeswold?" "Little Missis put it there; I never lifted the candlestick, even to dust, never, and it's gone!" "But the man! Dinah?" "Is gone," repeated Dinah. "Did he come in the day?" asked Mattie, changing her form of question, in the hope of eliciting a more direct answer. "In the night; but Pomp had not come back. He is in that heavenly home, singing, singing, with the golden harp, never stopping, and there shall be no night there, no night there." "Was your candle lighted, Dinah?" ' INo need of the sun, neither of the moon to shine in it, for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof." "Aly father would say it was wicked if any one else should quote the Bible so, Dinah; but it seems to be as natural to you, VOL. II.       18  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7089-00000104"/> 206        CHESTNUT WOOD. as the breath of life. I wonder if you think of any thing else - Do you?" Dinah shook her head, but did not attempt an answer. Mattie knew her sufficiently well, to be sure that now, if pressed upon this point, she should hear nothing from her, but fragments of that same verse, therefore she very adroitly turned the subject for the present, determined not to approach it again, until Dinah should have become perfectly quiet. At last, watch- ing her time, she said:-- "Do many people come to see you at night, Dinah? "' Not many, sometimes." "That man, that took away what Sybil left, was he old, or young, like Jerry, or like my father?" "Neither." "Neither, why illwhat was he like; -did he give any reason for taking it; I should call it stealing if he did not?" "He said, ' it is for me,' and went away, and Little Missis is gone too." "Was that all?" "All, but it is gone." "What was it?" "Gone, Little Missis is gone." "( Is that all you know about it?  "Gone, quite gone, I -can rub the dust there now; poor little Missis." The connection between the tling, the dust and little Missis, was now quite confused, and 3iattie became convinced, that no ingenuity on her part, could draw forth another concise answer, so she began to think seriously over what she had heard, and to wonder if there might not be some connection between the in- truder into Dinah's cottage, and Chestnut Wood. She wished very much to find about what time he had been there, and there- fore resolved to return home now, and come to see Dinah again on the following day. Sle was glad of an excuse for not going G   CHESTNUT tWOOD.         2(7 then, to Chestnut Wood; she considered this discovery as more important than any she could possibly have made in the house itself, so trying to impress on Dinah's mind, that she should come again soon, and that it would be safer for her, if she slipped the bolt at night over her front door, she returned to Hymeswold. The walk seemed much shorter and less solitary. She was very busy trying to explain to herself two things. One, what Sybil could possibly have put upon the old negro's mantel piece, which she considered so much an ob- ject of trust, and the other, who would, and with what object, have gone in at night and removed it. To her, as swell as to every one else, who knew Sybil, there was much mystery con- nected with her, and sometimes in spite of her love for her, she found herself thinking of her, with a species of wonder, almost amounting to distrust. And now, the more she thought of it, the more perplexed she was with one feature of the case. Why, if this took place some- time ago, had not Dinah mentioned it to her befbre, during some of her many visits to her? Could it be that it was only on the last night that her cottage had been entered? If so, of course there could be no connection between the two events, and she might spare herself any further trouble of inquiry." Mattie had never accustomed herself to thinking with much feeling of care, or responsibility, on any point, and therefore it was quite new to her now, to have the first clue to so important a discovery in her own hands, and she revolved and re-revolved the whole subject until her brain became almost as confused as old Dinah's, and she would have been very thankful, to be able to consult her clear sighted mother, on many doubtful points. In her dreams that night she was wandering through dark and winding passages, losing her path constantly, and being obliged to wait for Dinah to pray, before she could find her way out. The next morning she felt half sick, and looked so pale,  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7089-00000105"/> 208        CHESTNUT rWOOD. that her mother really objected to her fatiguing herself by a long walk; but Mattie said she had promised to go and read to old Dinah, and Mrs. Rogers would have been unwilling to have her disappointed, particularly as she had great hope, that her simple, sincere piety, might not-be without its effect upon Mat- tie's own mind. She therefore contented herself, with putting up a nice little basket of such delicacies, as the parsonage af- forded, and making ZMattie promise that she would walk slowly. This, Mattie fully intended to do, but she forgot it, in her eagerness to have the one important point of time settled, and much sooner than her mother would have thought proper, she was sitting beside Dinah, in her little room. "As much as three weeks ago, was it, Dinah," she asked, hav- ing carefully watched her opportunity," since that man came and took away what Sybil had put under the brass candle- stick?" "One Sunday, two Sundays," said Dinah, making a painful effort to reckon by the only calendar she ever knew. "Two Sundays ago. Well, that is a long time. Shall I read about Sunday in the Bible to you now, Dinah?" Dinah's eyes brightened, and her lips followed as Mattie read the sacred words; nor was she satisfied, when one chapter being finished, Mattie said "she must go, for she had a long walk to take before she should return home, as she was going around by Chestnut Wood." She had now gained more from Dinah than -she had dared to anticipate, and quite emboldened by her success, she had an uncontrollable desire, to see if nothing there could advance her, still a step farther. The house looked grander, and more solitary to her, than ever, as she approached it by the lake plath, and in spite of her newly born courage, filled her with many unpleasant apprehen- sions; but there was a fascination about it, which still drew her on, and stealing stealthily as if her errand were also one of crime,   CHESTNUT   WOOD.          209 she passed through the garden, up to the library window, and endeavored to open the blind; but Jerry had made this too fast to be started by any common means, and she had to content herself by turning them, and looking through. Every thing remained just as they had left it; the papers were scattered upon the floor, and the portrait with the firm lips, still looked haughtily down from the walls. Mattie's desire to be within the room only increased, as she saw every thing so still, and safe, and she remembered a back entrance connected with the stables,  which she could not recollect that Jerry had fastened, and if he had not, she thought she could easily put her hand through at winlow, close beside it, and slip back the bolt. In order to reach it, she must pass through the stables; but she had been there often with, Sybil, to see Rose, and knew her way well; therefore, though there was much trepidation in her touch as she lifted the latch, she was not frightened back, by the loud barking of' the stable dog, or the fierce way in ;hich he sprang upon her, before he recognized her. Rose turned her pretty head in the stall, and neighed her welcome, and going -up to her, Mattie petted her, as she had so often seen Sybil.  To her astonishment, as she turned to leave her, Rose turned also, and began to follow her out of the stable. "No, Rose, no," she said, giving her no very gentle blow with her hand. Rose turned, tossed her head, and immediately re- tured to the stall, a feat which, in after days, was recorded as among her most spirited. Jerry had forgotten this door, as Mattie hoped, and she could easily raise the window, and slip back the bolt, security being no very special part of Mr. Atherton's plan in building the house. Mattie's footsteps sounded arid resounded so desolately tl;.t she began to move on tiptoe, and shut the doors behind her, as gently as if some one lay very sick within the house, and she feared to disturb them. After again examining the library. and 18'  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7089-00000106"/> 210         CHESTNUT WOOD. finding notlhing new to repay her search, she determined to go to 5A{r. Atherton's sleeping apartment, and open the closet doors, and bureau drawers. The first door she opened, she found the closet in much con- ulsion, as if it had been thoroughly ransacked, and lying upon ithe floor a large wooden box, whose dimensions her eye at once assured her would correspond exactly with that of the fi'ame of the new portrait. Every lock of the bureau was also broken, but its contents were not removed, as nothing was to be found there but Mr. Atherton's clothes. Here, then, was another link to the chain which had escaped Jerry's ob- servation, and Whllich she should store up to tell Mr. Atherton as soon as he should arrive.- It was evident to her, that who- ever had come, had come for and accomplished a special object; and she had not, like Jerry, tact enough to perceive that she might possibly be considered as meddling with what did not belong to her, in making what discoveries she had. Elated by her success, she began to think much more of it than of the lonely house, and was proceeding quite boldly to leave it, when she perceived that she had left the door of the library open. As she stepped forward to close it, she saw the figure and face of a man throuigh the turned blind; but she neither started or screamed. With a boldness for which she always after took especial credit, she walked directly toward the window and endeavored to remove the fastenings so that she could look out. But Jerry had driven too many nails to haive them pulled out easily by a woman's fingers, and long be- fore Mattie would be convinced that it was impossible, the man llad disappeared. Slowly and very reluctantly her suspicions were lulled by such glimpses of the garden under the win- dow as she was able to procure through the blinds; and -when at last she thought of going up stairs and looking from one of the chamber windows, to a distance, not a sign of human life was to be seen; so she went out the same way in which   CHESTNUT WOOD.         2" she had entered, and fastened the door behind her. She was too nmuch excited to think of fear, and therefore walked much more boldly home than she had done to Chestnut WTood. She was not even started by the sound of quick footsteps following hIer; she remembered the old black cow, and if she thought of it at-all, it Aasonly a vision of the animal that passed throughll ler mind, therefore she stopped as if rooted to the spot when she heard her name called by a voice, alas! now too familiar to her waking dreams. M' iss Rogers! Ailattie! wait, I have been looking for you ;" and in a moment Billings was walking by her side. With a very careless, much at home air, lie looked familiarly in her face, and said: - "You do n't seem very glad to see me. Does papa and mamma object so decidedly to my acquaintance?" Mattie saw as she glanced at him, that he was very differ- ently attired from what he used to be. His clothes were black, of the nicest and neatest kind, and not an article of jewelry was visible upon his whole person. His hair, too, had changed to a beautiful auburn, all appearance of a beard was removed, and dark blue spectacles covered his small gray eyes. , Perhaps," he continued, evidently amused by Mattie's as- tonishment at his changed personal appearance, " you do not recognize me; and really I am very much altered. I have re- nounced the profane practice of the law, and intend coming down to Hymeswold to study divinity with your worthy father." He paused, but Mattie made no answer, therefore he went on: I came down to day for two purposes. One, I suppose, as you saw me at the window at Chestnut Wood, you may imag- ine, but you may also guess a great way from it, so we will make no remarks about that if you please, to any one; and an- other was, if possible, to see you, and see if you would recog- nize me. If you did not, I have very little reason to suppose any one else .would; and therefore I could present myself quite  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7089-00000107"/> 212        CHESTNUT WOOD. boldly to your father as a candidate for the ministry. I hlad some idea of asking to board in your family, but one gets so tired of never acting like tlhemselves, that I did not know but what I should get tired of my bargain. Should you have known nc?. Now be honest with me, and tell me the truth." Tlle self-satisfied air with, which he closed his sentence was quite imposing, and was not without its effect upon {Mattie. She glanced stealthily at him and said:- "No% never, unless you had spoken." "So you remembered my voice, did you," answered Billings, changing the tone so entirely that Mattic for a moment thought some one else must have joined them. "Well, if it was not too much trouble, it would be easy enough to prevent any one finding me out in that way, but it is a thing a person is so apt to forget, particularly if he is in a hur- ry." If nobody in Hymeswold recognizes me, well and good, it will be all the better for my purposes; but if they do, I must put the best face I can upon the matter, and say I am so altered in character, and feel so deeply (as your good father would say, Miss Mattie) the sin and folly of my former course, that I harve determined so entirely to forsake it, as not evenl to retain the former niame by which I was known. No one can find fault ith that, I am sure. And now, as we may possibly be met walkinc together, I -will say quickly what I have to say,  ancl then take another path. 'You don't seem very glad to see ' me. I am disappointed in that. Perhaps you liked me bet- ter as a young lawyer; but I can assure you I shall make an excellent parson, and thlat before many weeks have passed, you I will like me better than ever. What I want you to do to help mne on in my cgood intentions, is not to know me, to atet as if you had never seen me1 before, and, on no account, to say a word about lhaving seen -me down at Chestnut Wood. I de- clare you firightened me terribly there. I thought Mr. Ather- ton and the whole'family must have come down unexpectedly,   CIIE'STNUT 'WOOD.        21  thlough I made sum that they were in the city before I left; and every step as I ran away I fancied that big black brute was at my heels." "How did you know I was alone?" asked Mattie. "Hid myself up in the first thick tree I came to, anlld watch- ed you; saw you come out of the stables; and now should like to know what brought you to the house, and why you did not unlock the front door, and go in, instead of crawling around there." Mattie lhad discretion enough not to return a direct an- swer ; but her evasion was so clumsy, that Billings at once per- ceived it. "You are not willingc to tell me. Very well, you must do as you please now, but next time I shall insist on knowing. I tell you so many secrets, that it is hardly fair to have the confidence all on one side; but now, I am in too muchll hurry to go. I may call at the pCarsonage to-night, and may not, until next week, but whenever I do, of course, you have never seen me before, you will remember." "With a grin, very sarcastic, and very sardonic, he touched his hat, and walked rapidly back in the direction of Chestnut Wood. iNo sooner had lie gone, than Mattie's mind, which had been rather stupefied by the suddenness of the whole affair, awoke to a  more refreshinrg consciousness of what had taken place, and she listened with doubt and trepidation to the sound of his re- treating footsteps. "What can he mean, and what does he want?" she asked herself with her customary impatience. "How foolish in me not to ask him.  I will run now." She turned to follow him, but he was nearly out of sight, and pursuit she saw would be useless, therefore with much self-up- braiding, she slowly pursued her way home, meditating, as she went, upon what she had said, and what could possibly be his motives for such a plan.  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7089-00000108"/> 214        CHESTNUT WOOD. Sometimes the commission of a great fault will develop, modify and mould character more quickly than any thing else.  Often much good springs out of the evil, and sincere re-    i pentance will effect what years of partial good intention never  could, but to require such discipline indicates much weakness, and those who pass through it, are apt to find themselves like the If burned child with deep scars, left to attest the extent of suffer- 'f ing necessary to teach them a lesson; so to a partial degree had  it been with Mattie. She was deeply sensible of her fault and - folly in her intimacy with Billings while in ]New York. She regretted it, however, more for the consequence which it had brought, than for the want of refinement and principle which i it had indicated; perhaps she had never thoroughly compre-  hended, and here again she showed her weakness, what the actions involved, and her mother had very little clearer insight. into its moral heinousness than Mattie herself. She considered ! it wrong in her to have disobeyed her own positive command, but went very little furtler than this; and Aunt Mary had had : no opportunity of conversation with her since,' and therefore  this present attack upon her judgment had found Mattie only "j loosely armed against it; and her moral reflections, as she  . weighed the appearance of deceit implied in Billings's new char- acter, were very desultory and uncertain. Before she had reached the gate of the parsonage, she had determined to keep ; the secret, and let matters work out their own way, reserving  to herself, what was moreover strictly true, the excuse of not i being at all certain; but the change of character was genuine, and his intentions in entering upon the study of divinity sound 1 and orthodox, as her father would desire. Mattie lhad now committed her second great fault; and no character of much intrinsic value is often found guilty of that. 1 A shadow passed with her into that little parsonage of Hymcs-  wold, that darkest of' all shadows, the one cast by the obscuring of' the sun of moral worth.   CHAPTER XII. JERRY was no laggard on his way to New York. The impor- tance of haste seemed to him greater than any thing else, par- ticularly as he was so oppressed with the desire to confess W hat- ever blame 3[r. Atherton chose to attach to him, was all just and well deserved. lIe therefore reached the city at an early hour, and presented himself in the parlor, just as the family had come in from the breakfast table. He had firmly resolved not to do anything that should indi- cate before the ladies that he came on business of any special importance; but to %wait until he could see Mr. Atherton alone; so his first salutation was one which relieved Aunt lMary en- tirely, from the anticipation of evil to her brother's family, which Iis sudden appearance had at once suggested. "Good morning; this is living in the city, I suppose, but lown there at I Iynleswold, we should call it only just dinner- ine. -ow do you all do?  Mr. Atherton, I hope you are Vell, sir. I just ran dow\n fbr an hour or so, and it's almost ime for me to be a going back now. Why, Miss Sybil, what picture you do grow to be? You beat Mattie by a whole head ow.

A   very -welcome morning caller Jerry was, and so both Miss togers and Sybil gave him every occasion to think, for they had '.

They were literally there but a few minutes; but when her grandfather entered the parlor again, Sybil easily detected the marlks of anxiety and anger upon his face. She did not ven- ture to ask what had happened, but raised her eyes to his with such resistless inquiry, that he said:-- "Nothing of much importance. Some one has broken into the house at Chestnut Wood, and has made bad work, so Jerry says, with my papers. I must go down immediately, and as I shall be detained a few days there, I have told Jerry he had better remain here, while I am away."     * Sybil had turned very pale, which her grandfather observing, said: - "You need not feel any uneasiness on my account; I shall take down John, and shall stay for the most part of my time at tle Rising Sun." "Why not let us all go with you, grandpapa?" - Because, it is too early to move into the country, and be- cause my business require$ haste; you must be content to stay a little while without me." " ut. I shall be constantly imagininog some evil is befalling( you. Do you remember how?" '; Yes, Sybil, I do not easily forget it," and a very dark cloud passed over Mr. Atherton's face; but I can see now no possi- ble danger to apprehend ; and when I tell you, that I go in ten minutes, you will feel the impossibility of any one's accom- panying me." Sybil knew it would be of no use to urge any further, so she   CHESTNUT WOOD.        . 217 made a great effort to calm herself, and assist her grandfather in preparations fbo his speedy departure, -and was quite re- paid for the exertion by the gratified smile with which he said: - "There is, after all, a good deal of the hero in our little spoiled Sybil." "Not spoiled, dear grandpapa," said Sybil, clinging around his neck, as if' she were indeed "' little," nor much of the hlero either, I am af'aid ; for it is all I can do, to keep my tears back this very minute.  See Nep, how he is begging to go; and you mzust take him, if you refuse to all of us." "Down, Nep, down sir," said Mr. Atherton, as the dog con- tinued to leap upon him; "No sir, I can't be partial, you must stay with your young mistress." 'Please. dear grandfalther," said Sybil, in ttose pleading tones, whichh no one knew low to resist, "t Please do take hm; lie has been shut up in the city so long, it will do him good to "have a firee run in the country. See how he hold I his llead, as if' he were already snuffing the air of Chestnut Wood. 1 will stay willingly, if you will only take him." "I told you, you were spoiled, Sybil," Mr. Atherton said, kindly; ; but fbor your sake, Nep may go." Nep sprang to the door, and stood upon the upper step, with almost a human expression of thanks upon his intelligent face; and Sybil saw hler grandfather depart with much less anxiety than a half hour ago she would have thought it possible. For the last six months, Sybil's life had been one of much more quiet than she lad dared anticipate after the reception of her first note from her faither. She had informed hitn of the money she had left for him at Dinah's cottange; and had sent him regrular remitances as first as she had received them frlorn her grandfather; reserving only enough for hler slight necessi- ties, and practising even in these a rigid economy, for which Aunt Mary was much puzzled to account.

Nancy had been the silent bearer of these despatches; and Sybil never knew that it was to her earnest solicitations, and even threats, that she principally owed her freedom from an- noyance. "Nancy had become," so Mrs. Giles said, " almost perfect in her department of housework; was quiet, orderly and respect- ful, and quite a pattern for all the other servants; she had but one fault to find with her, and that was, that she grew every day thinner and thinner, until she looked more like a walking ghost than like a human being." She looked half-starved, and that was a silent reproof upon her housekeeping; for, to her experienced eye, there could be no better index of a good housekeeper, than the " well to do appearance" of her servants. So Mrs. Giles used to fret considerably, because in spite of all her efforts, Nancy looked pale and haggard; and although she never complained, she had sometimes entered the room sud- denly, and heard her attempting to suppress a cough. On such occasions she always prescribed some medicine, which Nancy swallowed willingly, though with an incredulous smile, which rather discomfited good Mrs. Giles. Miss Rogers had gradually, and with care, interested herself in the girl, also, and had been endeavoring in her own quiet, gentle way, to do her good. In reply to her inquiries as to whether she could read or write, Nancy had flashed her dark eye on her, and had an- swered: "I know all about them that I wish." And Aunt Mary had always afterwards contented herself with indirect efforts to reach her. She soon found that more could be done through Sybil, than in any other way; and having made her a participater in her plans, she was able to accomplish much. At first, Sybil was very shy of these efforts; she had an in- tinctive fear of Nancy, which never failed to make her un- comfortable in her presence, and was always expecting, when Si   CHESTNUT WOOD.         219 by chance, she was left alone with her for a moment, that some- thing unpleasant was about to take place. Knowing, too, as much as she did, of her connection with her own father, she had many serious doubts whether, if her grand- father knew all, he would allow her to remain in his family; and by concealing it from him, she was fearful she was carrying on a deception, neither proper or right. When very much annoyed by these doubts, she had always recourse to those few magical words which settled so many dif- ficulties: "Is he not my father, and what earthly tie have I that is nearer?" She was therefore surprised when, in spite of all the trouble which she had occasioned her, she found herself' becoming interested in, and almost attached to Nancy. But the signs of affection for her, which Nancy gave, were less equivocal. There was a kindling, even in that bright eye, whenever she approached her, that told her more plainly than any words, of the pleasure her presence gave; and if she but uttered a kind word, the color dame rushing into that pale face, - a sure evidence of the emotion it excited. "Do that strange being good, Sybil, when you can," Aunt Mary said, often, to her; and Sybil tried, through much shrink- ing, to bear it in mind. "It is of no use," she said, after making several fruitless ef- forts one day, to Aunt Mary; '; I cannot talk with her long; she looks so steadily at me that I become confused, and forget all I meant to say. I asked her this morning, as you wished me, whether she ever went to church, and she fixed her eyes upon me and only said: ' No, never;' but I could not speak another word; and yet she stood, waiting to hear what else I had to say." Never goes to church," said Aunt Mary, in a voice of much concerns; "poor thing, how wicked she must be! does she ever read her Bible, or pray, do you suppose, Sybil?"  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7089-00000111"/> 220        CHESTNUT %WOOD. 'I hardly think she knows how to 'read; but for prayer, every body must pray, Aunt Mary!" "I am afraid not. I wish you would ask her, if she knows there is such a being as God. I have the feeling that a heathen is amongst us; and that it is really very wrong for me to re- main in such entire ignorance of her spiritual state." '"Then you had better talk with her yourself, Aunt Mary; I shall endeavor to; though, so far, she only answers me in monosyllables, and goes away the moment she can find an excuse." Many conversations like the above passed between Miss Rogers and Sybil, and still Aunt Mary remained in equal doubt as to Nancy's 1" spiritual state,"- and still the impression of the heathen girl remained strong upon her mind. For the last two or three weeks Sybil had noticed a change in Nancy, of which, as yet, she had not spoken to Aunt Mary. Tilhe girl glided in and out of the room, where they were sitting, much more frequently than usual, and Sybil would often find her waiting in Maggy's place, when she went to her own room. At such times, Nancy performed the little acts of service promptly and gently, in a manner so different fi'om the bustling, kind-hearted Irish girl, that Sybil was often painfully struck with the difference, and long after Nancy had removed the can- dle from the room, her image, pale, and almost spectral, would seem to Sybil to be moving near her. She had a nervous dread, and yet felt so irresistibly attract- ed toward her, that she could not request Maggy not to allow her to come, in her stead, and so by degrees it became almost a matter of' course, that she should see Nancy when she went to her room. A fbw nights after her grandfather had gone to Chestnut Wood, not having him to entertain, she went earlier than usual to her chamber, almost hoping to supersede the necessity of calling any one; but Nancy was already there, and to Sybil's surprise, immediately commenced a conversation. ?   CHESTNUT WOOD.         221 "Mr. Atherton has gone down to Chestnut Wood, has he not?" "Yes," answered Sybil, fearing what might come next.  Do you know w/hy he went?" Sybil hesitated a moment, - then said:-- "Yes; he went because the house has been broken into." "Was anythincg taken away?" "I do n't know, I have not heard. "Does Jerry know?" "Yes, I presume so; but he does not like to answer me, when I ask him about it." "Will you ask him to-night?" "To-night,-why?" "Because," and Nancy spoke slowly and deliberately, fixing at the same time her eye full upon Sybil's bureau, " because if theft has been committed, I am fi'ee! Will you ask for me?" "Certainly," said Sybil, with a sinking of heart which almost deprived her of the power of motion. "It is only just," she repeated over and over to herself; as she went to find Jerry, - only just." Jerry knew nothing more about the robbery than he had already told Sybil; so far as he could judge, nothing had been removed beside papers, and whether these had been taken was more than he could say; about the portrait, he preserved an inviolable silence, both to Miss Rofgers and Sybil, in obedience to Mr. Atherton's request. Sybil was greatly relieved in some respects, but more troubled in others. A regular theft she considered as somethinrg to siri  rwhich her father would not descend; but she was inot so sure, but that it was a relief' to be certain of it; and then again, the fact that only papers had been soughlt, in her own mind, ren- dered it highly probable, that no one beside her father would have had sufficient interest in, to wish to secure them. Many vague surmises of this kind had passed through her mind, be- \i                19*  &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7089-00000112"/> 222        CHESTNUT WOOD. fore the eager questions of Nancy, and her known connection with her parent had fixed the stigma of the deed upon him. Now, as she returned to Nancy, she had no doubt that she had been for the last few weeks aware of what had taken place, and that that would account for thie chlange in her behavior. With what a burning sense of shiame and degradcation, the innocent girl stood once more before Nancy. Her youth seemed all to have faded away beneath its heavy pressure; and bowed, and almost crushed, she now became the ques- tioner. "Ann," she said, with her eyes bent upon t he floor, and her breast heaving convulsively, " answer me, and answer me truly, - Did he do this?" There was a moment's silence, then with that sharp, un- earthly voice, which always thrilled throurgh Sybil, Nancy said :- ' If' I answer you, the penalty for me is death." 'And he is guilty then," said Sybil, with so much agony in her tone, that Nancy advanced a few steps toward her, and stood looking, anxiously at her. "Did lihe commit theft? ' she asked, and there was something more human in her voice. "Of nothing, but papers." "For your sake I am glad, for my own - but what matters it-life is almost over with me, and the sooner the better. It is a dreadful thing to live and die as I have," and die as I have and ybil felt her eyes flash upon her. "' You think it hard to hear the sins of another. You look now like a flower with a broken stem, because he Ilas done what the laws condemn; but I am but a few years older thIla you are, and see me now! I am dying, and I am .glad to die! Until I came here, my life was one long life of sin and misery. Miss Rogers says the same God made us all. I wish she could tell me, why he made some of us to be always wicked, always   5             CHESTNUT WOOD.         223 w wretched; to suffer for food to eat, and clothes to wear; to go hungry and naked, or steal and beg? Why did he make Sybil Thornton, rich and beautiful, and good, and yet make me poor and put me where I should never learn what right was. Look at me now! Look well at me! Did you ever see me before?' Sybil raised her eyes, and looked steadily in Nancy's face. "I do not remember," she said, " and yet I have always felt that I had seen you before." "No wonder," said Nancy, a for I am much changed since then. I was not any older than you are now. Have you for- gotten the little room in the attic, and Nancy, who learned to love you the first time her heart had ever known what it was to love?" "I remember all perfectly," said Sybil with a shudder. 4"1t was only because it was so long ago, that I had not recognized you before." "You shudder and turn away from me," said Nancy, who had been watching her narrowly, " and I do not blame you! Farewell; you shall never see or hear of me again." Swiftly as a shadow Nancy passed from the room; and when on the following day, Sybil looked anxiously to see her at her regular work, she was no where to be fobund. Mrs. Giles came all astonishment to talk the matter over with Miss Rogers. "Last night," she said, " rather late in the evening,! Ann had gone out of the kitchen, taking a bundle with her. (The ser- vants were accustomed to her silent manner of doing things, and supposing she was sent away on some errand, had made no inquiries. As she did not return before they left the kitch-     en the door was unlocked for her; but in the morning they tI   found it as they had left it, Nancy not having returned.

Sybil, of course, wtas the only one in the house to whomn the action was at a1ll expl'ainedl; and after a sleepless night, she was still so uncertain as to what she oulght to do, that Aunt Mary soon learned firom her troubled fae, a mind ill at ease. "Do you feel troubled about this sudden disappearance of Ann?" she asked. "Yes ; very miuc(,", answered Sybil. Wihen I went up stairs last night, I found her in my room, and we had a conversation, which so surprised me, that I did not say or do a single thing I should." "Will you tell me what it was about?" "I so much wish I could ; but I must not.  Ol! Aunt Mary, if you only knemw all, what a comfort it would be to me! "Then, tell me' all." "I cannot. I cannot tell you anything; any thing but what she said about herself." "What was it?" "She said she should like to ask you about God. HHow He could make me iwlhat I am, and make hler so poor :dtl( wicked, and thll:t she was goingr to die, andc she wavs glad of' it, she did not will to live!" The tears streamed over Sybil's cheeks, bout A unt Mary's flace onlly expressed astonishment and dismay. "Wlat did you tell her, Sybil?" she asked very quietly, not- withstanding, her surprise.

You must remember that God has put 'me in the place of {f  a mother to you, and you should speak freely to me, as you would have to her." "Dear Aunt Mary, I could not love my own mother better, you." With that instinctive perception which is so ready a part of a noble nature, Aunt Mary at once perceived that there was something upon Sybil's heart, about which she had no right to press an inquiry, therefore, after a moment's hesitation, she said with more than usual gentleness: -- : "You shall do as youL think right, Sybil, I am not afraid to   trust you." i"Thank you, Aunt Mary; you must trust me, and forgive me for much." "Forgive you, Sybil?" "Yes; if you knew all, you would have to forgive me." !!-"!"Have you done what was wrong?" " Not knowingly or willingly; yet I am not sure that I have I   - always done right." -,    "Neither can any of us ever be," said Aunt Mary, soothingly.

"There is nothing to prevent my trying to find her. I mean no reason why I should not, if I can?" Sybil hesitated, but at length said: "None that I know of; I do hope most sincerely you may find her; for she seemed sick, and may, as she said, die!" "I will go at once," said Aunt Mary rising, "I have a feel- ing that if we ever find her, there is no time to lose." ' Stop, Aunt Mary," said Sybil, calling eagerly after her; she will think that I have betrayed her." "I will tell her that you only told me, that she was sick and suffering, and I came to help her." "Tell her that quickly, then, or you may alarm and do her more harm than good; I wish I could go with you, but I ought not. I am sure you would say I must not." "And nothing without knowing your particular reasons would induce me to let you go. I shall probably go to a great many places, to which I do not wish to have to take you, so you may rest perfectly quiet at home, while I do all I can to find the girl." "Where shall you go first, Aunt Mary?  I am sure I cannot tell. Looking up one poor girl in a city filled with the poor and sick as this, is like attempting, as Mattie's mother would say, 'to find a needle in a hay loft.' Miss Rogers's tone. was cheerful, and it sounded very plea- santly to Sybil's troubled heart. "But I shall go first to her room, and examine whatever things she may have left, to see if there is any thing there, which can give me a hint in my search. ' I can go with you there, Aunt Mary."

If Ann should be sick-sicker than she is I   now, I mean; she may want them. By this little arrangement, Aunt Mary showed both her tact i    and kindness. There is nothing which so soon quiets and equal- izes the feelings, as occupation, particularly if the fingers may be employed in the service of those for whom the mind is busy, and perhaps anxious, so now while Aunt Mary went away in i   I her rather hopeless task of mercy, Sybil sat at home, and Itt   passed the hours, contributing to the same object. Nancy had left quite a number of articles belonging to her, and as Miss Rogers looked them over, she found everything neat and in the best order, and to her great satisfaction an old outside of a letter, with no name, but a number and street for a direction. Taking a map of the city, she searched out the street, then carrying it with her for a guide, went with much fear and many misgivings to the spot. The way led her through scenes of filth and misery, the very existence of which, she had never before conceived, and she had many times to close both eyes and ears to what was taking place around her. It seemed to her, as if she should never find the place she sought; and had not Nancy's question of the justice of God dwelt painfully upon her own mind, she would probably have turned away from such a part of the city. But every fresh discouragement, only served to make her feel the more intense desire to save the girl from such a death as was before her; to tell her not only of God, but of his saving and s   redeeming Son. !     At last she found the street, and with a little difficulty the house. "Numbers," said a woman of whom she inquired, with a wicked leer, "are changed pretty often in this street; but you seem very civil and well spoken, and don't look as if you would  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7089-00000115"/> 22          CHESTNUT WOOD. harm a fly; so I don't know as there is any harut in telling you wlhere that number used to be; thlat is the house. You need n't make much stop to ring at the door, tpeople go right in there." Miss Ro(ers's courage almost fililed lher, but she applroachlled the door, and notwithstanding rwhat the woman had told her pulled the bell handle. The door was slightly ajar, and her senses were sufficiently quickened by fear, to liear the sou(nd of doors within opened and shhut arefully, and if' she had looked at the windows, she would have seen many eyes gazing stealtlilly at lher', from them. No one answered the ring, so pusiling the door more uidely open, she entered the hall, and looked around her; but betfore she had tilnme to decide what to do next, several l;lf dressed gills came running down firom the upper sto y, and all asked in a breath :- "What she wanted?" "Is there a sick girl here, named Ann M3orton?" asked Miss Rogers. "Ann Morton, no," said one, looking at the others, and wink- ing. "There don't any of us answer to that name today." '"Is there any one sick here, then?" "Yes, plenty sick," said another girl. ",There is always somebody sick, or dead here. Tlhere is a woman died here last nirlght." A fear that it might be Nancy, passed Aunt AIary's mind, so she asked : - "Was she young'?" "i Perhaps so, and perhaps not, we never know how old any body is here; but there she is in that, roomn, there has n't any one been to her since she stopped groaning. .You can go in and see her if you want to.

Satisfied by this answer,-that the dead woman could not be 1Nancy, and shocked by the levity and want of feeling, which tile young girls evinced, she turned to leave the house, and the last tlhing she' heard, as she went down the steps, was a mocking !lialghl, and the words, "t she found out a great deal, didn't she." Bthfore leaving the street, she saw the woman who pointed out the house to her, and she stopped her with the inquiry of whethe r she had found what she came after?" "No," said Aunt Mary, briefly. "1And that I might have told you before you went; no one ever findls what tlhey are loolking for, tlcre in that house. Have you any objections to tellingr me what you wistled?" "None ; I wanted to find a girl named Ann Morton. She is I arn afraid sick and in need."

"She never spoke, unless she was spoken to, that I know of," answered Aunt Mary. "She lived for some months at MJr. Atherton's, in   street." "Out at service," said the woman in surprise. "Well, I think you will have to look somewhere else for her. There are not many girls who go into families to live, in this street. I -wish you better luck next time." Aunt MfTary could not but thank her, even for so rough courltesy, and felt impelled, she could hardly tell by what, to return, after walking a few steps from her, and slip a half dollar into her hand.

The woman stared at her in surprise, and said:- "You must be very much in earnest, to find that girl; what do you want of her?" "She was sick, and I wished to help her." "People don't often want to help, without some kind of pay; what sort did you expect " "Nothing but to see her made comfortable." "You look honest," said the woman eyeing Aunt Mary care fully, ," but looks are not always to be depended on. What is your name?" "Miss Rogers! and my object is only what I tell you," said Aunt Mary, a suspicion that the woman might know more of Nancy, than she liked to confess, passing through her mind. "If you know any thing of the girl I seek, for her sake I beg you to tell me where I may hope to find her." "Perhaps I do, and perhaps I do not; you may come again next week, and if I have any thing to tell you, you shall hear it. If not, why you know how to let me off without troubling me about it, I suppose, don't you?" "Yes, I will ask no more questions than you choose to answer, and will come one week from to day. In the mean time, if Ann should be very sick and need any thing, you will find me at No. -, --    street." "Very well," and the woman shut her door somewhat rudely in Aunt Mary's face; but Miss Rogers felt as if she had gained a great object, and with comparatively a light heart, returned home. She found one of the caps neatly finished, and Sybil beginning to grow weary at her long delay; and when she told her of her partial success, she expressed so much disappointment, and regret, that Aunt Mary felt almost tempted to return, and make another trial. Her judgment however, easily convinced her of the folly of any such thing, and she recounted much that would interest Sybil, in the unusual sights which she had seen, hop- I      7,^  t.   I         OrCHESTNUT WOOD.         231 ing to cheer, and divert her thoughts from the strange girl, whom after all, it was a relief not to see among the members of the household. Sybil felt this more than any one else. The constant sight of Nancy, around the house, even the sound of her slight hacking cough, would remind her of her father, and the many unpleasant circumstances, attending her connection with him. Every day, she was fearful of some new development; every day, she looked forward with an excited, and nervous apprehen- sion, to some dreadful deed, which, rendered desperate by want and suffering, he might be tempted to commit. She could never see Nancy steal into the room, without her heart beating faster, and an agitation creeping over her, which she could neither subdue, or control. No wonder, that during the last six months, Sybil had lost nearly all her elasticity, and life. When our days begin to shorten, and the sun is nearing the west, we can bear better to see the shadow of a cloud hanging threateningly over us; but the brighhtrosy morning belongs by right, to the young, and we love not to hear that it has been overcast, Poor Sybil had not only now to fear sin, and shame, be- longing to one so closely allied to her, that she could not but share in its immediate consequences; but also the no less sure, and to be dreaded alienation of the hearts of those she loved. Frank and confiding in her own nature, she perhaps a little over valued the importance of these trials in her intercourse with others. To be obliged so frequently to pursue a course of action, for which she could give no satisfactory explanation, to be absent minded, to be conscious that her h eart was laboring with a great sorrow, and yet to keep it pent up, within itself, sometimes she could not but feel, that such a life was hardly worth the living.

She had therefome contented herself with providing constant and profitable employment for Sybil, since Mattie's return home; and in watching the growth and proper development of her character; of a character, purified, she often thought to herself, by that greatest of all refiners - secret affliction. Of course, Aunt Mary was not so little of a woman as not to indulge in many surmises as to what might be the nature of this affliction, and generally she found herself coming to the same conclusion, - that Sybil's mother had done wrong, and in some way incurred what she was sure must be the severe penalty of her father's displeasure; and that it was under the shadow of that action that Sybil was now, at times, walking. Perhaps within the last few months, there had also mingled in Aunt Mary's conjectures, the possibility of a coldness greater than she had suspected, subsisting between Sybil and Charles; Sybil seldom spoke of him; and Charles, in his rather frequent letters to her, rarely sent a message to Sybil. Still, she made no inquiries; she was a firm believer in true affection righting itself; though it were encompassed with an army of difficulties; and in her own letters to Charles, she took pains to write every little thing concerning Sybil that would be of interest to,him; and very frequently the letter bore some few gentle words of remembrance from Sybil her- self which were, literally to the young man, "more precious than rubies." On the morning after her return from her vain search for Nancy, Miss Rogers received a long letter from Charles, the contents of which, unlike her usual custom, she kept to herself. "Why do you not read me Charles's letter?"Sybil asked,   ;;V           CHESTNUT WOOD.          233 after she was sure that Aunt Mary had no intention of so doing. "Because," said Aunt Mary, playfully, "it has some im- portant secrets in it. which he begs me not to 'allow any other eye to reIuse,'-- I believe that is just his expression." The color mounted into Sybil's face. "4 He need not have been afraid any one would wish to," she said with spirit. "But it seems they did," answered Aunt Mary, archly; and there is one part of the letter which I may tell you." "I do not care to hear." "How exactly, that sounds like the little naughty Sybil, that must be sent to granldpapa if she does not begin to behave like a good girl immediately." Sybil smiled in spite of her vexation, and said, more good- naturedly: - "What is it, Aunt Mary? you see I am good, at once." "Yes, you generlally used to come quickly to terms, when I became sufficiently in earnest to make that threat; and now as then, you shall have your reward. Charles says,' His last vacation he spent at home; during his coming one, to coin- rmence in about a month, he should like to be in the city, if agreeable to his old friends.' "Dear Aunt Mary!" said Sybil, with a look of absolute terror;  do n't let him come; do write to him quickly, and tell him that he must not." "But why, Sybil?" asked Aunt Mary, in much surprise. "Because he must not, I should be so troubled and unhappy to have him; you will write at once, will you not, Aunt Mary?" "No, Sybil; your request seems so foolish, and perfectly un- accountable to me, that if you wish any such thing done, you must do it yourself." It was very unusual for Aunt Mary to speak in this way, but Sybil was too agitated to notice it; so she said:- Do not be unkind to me, Aunt Mary; I have many, and if  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7089-00000118"/> 234        CHESTNUT WOOD. you knew them, very good reasons, why Charles must not comine. "Let me know them, then." "I cannot tell you." "I cannot then write to Charles what you desire; you must give such messages through some other source." Sybil had now become conscious of Aunt Mary's unusual tone and manner; and looking up in her f:ace, she asked:- "Are- you angry with me?" "I think you both foolish and unreasonable, Sybil." "They are two very hard words to use, Aunt Mary," said Sybil, with a touching sadness in her voice, " perhaps, I really do not deserve them; but now, if you will not write to Charles for me, I must write for myself." Rising, she seated herself at her writing-table, and with no apparent misgiving of' heart, wrote these few lines, which, when she had finished, she handed to Aunt Mary to read:- "DEAR CHEAR'LES, - It seems to be my fate in life, to fail in making others happy. Your last visit to us, certainly did not add to your pleasure; and whatever circumstances made you unhappy then, will make you doubly so, now. "I lave asked Aunt Mary to write this for me, but she thinks me both ' foolish and unreasonable.' Perlhaps, you will do the same--perhaps, you may have more confidence in me. At any rate, do not come to visit us at. the city, at present, - and let the future bring to us both what it may, I shall never forlget you.                     SYBIL." Aunt Mary read and re-read the note, carefully. "There is much here, of course, Sybil," she said at last, " which I do not understand, and you misunderstood me if you thought my words implied want of confidence in you; still, you shall send it as it is, if you wish, to-morrow morning, and I will not offier the slightest objection."   -i 1ad           'CHESTNUT TWOOD.         235 It may be too late, then, Aunt Mary." "Too late! why the vacation does not commence for a month, at least; and Charles has no great choice of homes, so that he will not need long to make his plans." "Very true; I thought it was soon, to-morrow or next day, he was to come. But you can keep my letter; there can be nothing to make me alter my mind." Aunt Mary's heart had been regretting very fast her few se- vere words; and now, were it not that a voice there, pleaded also loudly for Charles, she would have gladly begged Sybil to forget them; but she could not quite overlook the disappoint- ment, as well as mortification, which it would be to Charles, and her own uncertainty as to the necessity of any such de- cision, placed her in a very unpleasant situation. She re- mained, however, outwardly firm in her first expressed opinion, as far as Sybil was concerned, and reluctantly folded the note to inclose it with one of her own, on the next day. No further conversation passed between them, though Aunt Mary often stole a look at Sybil, and was oppressed by the sad- ness which had now become so habitual a part of her beautiful fice. She longed to put her arms around her, as she used to do and comf'ort her; she felt almost impatient, as if she must know what it was that came so often between her and the dear - child,-- for child she still seemed to her, - and with much of the yearning earnestness of a mother's love, she found it hard to sit so quietly by, and know that Sybil suffered. And suffer indeed she did; suffer keenly, but patiently. Aunt AMary's reproving words, and the knowledge that her own ita  nact lead separated between Charles and herself, and that that act was indispensable but irreparable, seemed to her now, the last drops of' a full cup. "I can bear no more," she said, over and over again, to her- self, as she sat with that sad face intent, seemingly, on her needle, --"I can bear no more! God help me, now!" &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7089-00000119"/> 236         CHESTNUT WOOD. Since Nancy had revealed to her her own identity withl thle Nancy, whose memory had haunted her as an early troubled dream, she had been attempting to unravel thread after thread of that event. Nancy's present connection with ler fathler was a clue to the past, whch she hardly dared trust herself to follow; but day after day, a reflection fobced itself upon her, tlhat her father must have liad an' important agency in her removal fi'om Chestnut Wood, and she tried to identify him as she had seen him in the woods that niglit near Dinah's cottage, with eithler of the men whom she remembered, in the cellar in New York. Of one thing alone could she be certain, and that was, tliat he was not the one who actually carried her asway. There was something so repugnant to her, even now, in her memory of that person, that by no effort could she make him appear to her as she remembered her fatler. Of the other man she had seen so little, and then, when she was wearied and frightened, that she retained no distinct re- membrance of' him whatever. She could recall that he had spolken in an angry tone to Old Moll; and some very faint memories had she, of kindness and gentleness to herself. But the more settled her convictions became of the far see- ing plot, whch her own courage had alone resisted, the more timid she wa's with regard to the future. Her father certainly, she thought, would not hlave consented to her being removed from the house of her grandfather unless lie hlad some very imp)ortant ends to answer; and she could see no reason why she should not be considered more capable, and be tlought of more imlportance now, than then. INanc)'s sudden disappear- ance, and the probable results to her, were subjects of almost hourly reflection; and in urging Aunt Miary to search fbor Nan- cy, she lhad not only been guided by a desire to benefit the   I;;-           CHESTNUT WooD.         237 poor girl, but also to bring an end to the state of suspense in f which she was constantly kept. It was no wonder it seemed impossible to her, at just this time, to have Charles again a member of their family. His suspicions had been many times aroused, and his eye was always so vigilant, that she could not hope to liave even the slightest thing escape his observation. It was unnecessarily trying, she thought, to them both, and so, true to the instinct of filial duty, she sacrificed the warmest and nearest impulses of her heart. She tried to comfort herself by feeling that she had only done what was right; but alas! duty is but. a cold comforter to an aching heart, and they who act from a sense of rectitude alone, must early learn that their reward lies not in the gratifications of the earnincgs of earthly affections, but beyond time, in that better country, where tears shall be wiped from every eye, and the distant reward shall be changed into present fruition. i   . i.                          &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7089-00000120"/> CHAPTER XII1. AT the expiration of a week Jerry, who had until now made himself quite contented in the city, began to think of the ne- glected farming interests at Chestnut Wood. He expressed many doubts to Miss Rogers as to the soundness of Mr. Ath- erton's mind, if he could willingly and wilfully allow the different patches of ground so well known to himself to "lie idle, when the beautiful spring days were coaxing so hard to have some seed put into the earth." It seemed to him as if all the bright sunlight and the genial showers were sent in vain while nothing looked up from the brown earth to welcome them; and as day by day after the first week crept slowly by, hardly a more impatient heart beat within the great city. It was in vain for Miss Rogers or Sybil to try to make him happy; he said:- "There wan't no sich thing as drawing many more breaths in the city. The air was all smoke; nothing green to be seen, and such a lot of people driving about, who had nothing in the world to do, that for his part he was tired to death of it, and would rather any time see the grass a starting and the big trees shaking their old arms at him, than all the sights and sounds the whole city could boast." "I would rather, Miss Sybil," he said, and his whole face glowed with so intense a desire as to leave no doubt of his sin- cerity, "see one potato patch, with those dear little heads of leaves pushing up arter the sun, than all them fine pictures   CHESTNUT WOOD.          239 Miss Rogers carries me to see; only don't tell her, 'cause she means it kindly, you know ;" and so mourned Jerry one week longer for his beautiful country home. It was, therefore, quite a relief to them all, when a letter came from Mr. Atherton, an- nouncing his return on the following day. Jerry made one or two awkward attempts to seem sorry to leave Sybil, but the pleasure dancing in his eve so entirely gainsaid him, that Sybil told him she would " very willingly forgive him if he would promise to take good care of her two favorites, Rose and old Dinah, until they themselves should come down to Chestnut Wood." Jerry was not to leave until Mr. Atherton reached the city, and very impatiently he walked up and down the side walk, as if every step of his own would quicken the tardy movements of the comer. But at length he recognized the tread of the horses; he could distinguish the sound of their feet from among a multitude of others, and was so promptly at the carriage to open the door, that Mr. Atherton was not a little surprised. So, you have been looking for me, Jerry, have you?" he asked. "Full a week, sir. How are them are potato fields down at Chestnut Wood?" "Really, Jerry, I can't tell you much about them. I don't know as I have once thought of them since I have been there." "Not thought on 'em? Well, now, if that ain't curious. I' do n't know as they need feel hurt, for I have thought enough to answer for both. All day and all night it seems as if them patches had been staring at me, and asking me how soon I was coming. I hope you have not found much harm done there, sir?" he asked, suddenly changing his tone and the subject, nothing beside the papers and the pictur, was there?" "Nothing, I believe, Jerry. Are Miss Rogers and Sybil well?" "There they are to answer for themselves or rather there  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7089-00000121"/> 240        CHESTNUT WOOD. is Sybil," said Jerry moving away, and allowing Mr. Atlerton to get out of the carriage. It seemed a long time to both Mr. Atherton and Sybil since they had been separated. They had so many reasons for anx- iety, that when they could not know from hour to hour, the events which were transpiring near the absent, they had many painful fiars and forebodings which they could not share with any one else. And now to see each other unharmed, was the greatest possiblerelief to both. One single inquiring glance asked and answered all, and Jerry, as he took John's place and was driving the horses away, wondered much at the still manner in which they met. "One would think," he said to himself, "that they had only been apart an hour, instead of the very longest fortnight I ever knew. I wonder now, after all, if old Father Time has n't been taking a nap, and slept away a week without knowing on't. I should n't be much surprised." It may be inmagined Jerry-did not wait longer than was ne- cessary before setting out for Chestnut Wood, and that his horse made no delays which could be prevented on his way there. When Sybil was alone with her grandfather, she ventured to make a few inquiries respecting the robbery, but his answer was so peremptory that the tears started into her eyes. He had not spoken so before to her for years. He seemed im- mediately conscious of what he had done, for he said kindly :- "Sybil! you are now old enough, and I think woman enough, for me to take you into my confidence; and I intend to give you a full account of many things which, perhaps, it would have been well, if you liad known sooner; but I have always wished to spare you, if possible, the pain. Events now, over which I have no control, make it proper, or at least desirable, that you should be better informed, and to-morrow, if I am rested sufficiently, I will talk with you. Can you hear, child," he said, looking fixedly and almost sternly at her. "Can you Y3IPdHAOHVI YVLJVLV-  Vbi V   ::s CHESTNUT WOOD.                241 bear to be grieved, shocked, mortified! Can you bear all this and yet retain one spark of youth and joy? Poor child! I N would have spared you, but he drives me to it; and for your ownn sake it must be done." Sybil did not attempt to answer. She was trembling vio- len1ly, and her heart beat so fast, that its motion al1mot sufib- cated ler. She turned pale so quickly that her grandfa- ther, alarmed at the extent of the agitation which she evieed, 'put his arm around her and drew her fondly to him, as he had not done before since she was a child. There was something so protective and affectionate in the act, that Sybil nestled to him, like the fighlltened child, and anx- ious at once to shorten her agitation, he said:- "Perhaps, Sybil, as it will only prolong your excitement; I had better say what I have to say now." He stopped a moment, and he felt the slight figure he held quiver with emotion. "I wish I could comfort you by telling you that it is nothing very sad which I have to communicate; but, alas! Sybil, it is not so. It is one of the saddest of all tales of sin and misery. "Your grandmother was almost an angel, so I thought, when I first loved her; so I think now almost at the close of my power of loving. She was beautiful she was noble; she was true. What more can I say for her. She lived for me three short years. During all that time, I never discovered the slightest fault; but she died, Sybil, she died; all my love could not save her. I laid her in the ground, and I tried not to curse God then, for I believed in and feared him. "She left me one child - only one- it was all I had left of her. Do you hear me, Sybil, all? Do you know what that word means - al of one who was your all? She was a child that resembled her mother; her eyes were as deep, as full of soul; her voice, her little ways were winning and gentle like vot.

It was not her's, but her eyes looked upon me, and her voice spoke to me from her child, and I began to love it, at first slowly and reluctantly: I had no wish to be happy again; but by degrees, the long waving motion of the grass upon that grave came less firequently between me and our little Iary. I began to think less oft' her lying there, than I did of' an ancrel in heaven, and heaven then was a happy reality to me. Mary grew to be a woman. She was not much older than you are now; but she never was what her mother hlad been. She grew wilful; why should she not? If servants crossed her, they were immediately dismissed. She had no playmate, no teacher. I prized the jewel too much to even lend it tc another to prepare the setting, and, fbol that I was, I fancied that I could fill the mother's place to the child. I spared nc pains, no expense. I would have sacrificed every thing to have made her happy. I had no other wish in lifee; but I made ler selfish and arrogalnt, and then, when too late, discovered my mistake. -My business was such, as made it necessary for me to em- ploy a large number of clerlks; among those was one who soor became an especial favorite of mine. He was a generous, mannly youth ; very uncommonly shrewd and capable in business, anc I thllouht promising to be some day a partner in our concern As I had no son, I took especial pains with him, that he migll be fitted for this; and that his home education and mannenr Inight not be neglected, took him into my family. I employed for him, at my own expense, and in a manner, as I thouglut not likely to wound his feelings, the very finest masters the city afforded, and ihe made great progress in everything. I be. ga n to deDend upon him; more than that, I loved him, and Was proud of llitn, and trusted him with everything. But, Sybil- but- I was decuived! He was generous, and open, and manly   CHESTNUT WOOD.          2483 but he was tempted, and he could not resist. Hle began to as- sociate with thlose whose habits and tastes were at variance with all that was right; but when I remonstrated with him, he con- fessed it, anld promised me, with tears in his eyes, that he woulld never meet with them again. He broke his promnise; anid when I found it out, and coldly taunted him with it, he did not answer. He looked like a fiail, but still noble boy to me, and I took him once more to my heart and forgave him. HHe seem- ed touched and very repentant; he said " he would not promise abgain, for he could not ask me to trust him; but he would show me how sincerely he repented lwhat he had done, by an entire challnge in all his habits of life. For a year, he was good as his word. iNobody could be more straightfbr- ward in business, no one more prompt and efficient; and at home, my own son could not have seemed more devoted. I had entirely forgotten his failings; a fault repented and forsa- ken ceases to be any longer a fault. He lacked but one week - - only one short week, of beingr twenty-one; and on that day, I had intended to make hm a present of an eqlual share with me in my business, but he did not know it, no one knew it; I meant the pleasure should be in part in the surprise. I was sitting in mny office thinking much more of the joy a few days would bring to us all than of my busingss, when I received a call from my banker. He broughl t with hi'm a check to no very large amount, which had been dlawn upon him on tihe previous day. He had paid it then witlhout a question, but liad had some doubts since, which lie thought it safe to have sa- tisfied. "He was right; the draft was a forgery, but I immediately gave Ihim a note fbr the. same sum ; and begged him for tihe present, until I could investigate the matter, to keep the know- let dge -of it to himself. As he was now no loser, he readlily consented, and I begaln slowly and carefllly to endeavor to fer- ret out the culprit. Fortunately, I too, kept the matter to my-  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7089-00000123"/> 244        CHESTNUT WOOD. self; for, before many days, I hlad reason to suspect the man whom I had loved as a son. I followed the thing u, until I had no longer any reason to doubt, then calling him, charged him with it. He confessed it, without one moment's hesitation, and fillling upon his knees, prayed for mercy in such piteous words, that I could not refuse it. He said that withinl a month he had contracted the habit of gambling--had run largely into debt-- and a debt of' I)onor must be paid. A debt of honor - honorably paid ^ but I forgave him. again, and burned the pa- pers, which would have made the forger my partner. Still, I could not refrain as I held them in my hand over the glowing -coals, to show them to him, to give himn a knowledge of what he had lost. He uttered an awful oath. It -was the first I had ever heard from his lips; but it came readily, as from a heart accustomed to profanity, and from that moment, I felt almost sure that ihe was lost. "Still, with blind folly, T persevered, with the vain hope of saving him, as if a mind that would stoop to practise deceit, could be saved. I know better now. I was a fool to trust then." "Save the erring!" broke from Sybil's lips, as for the first time she raised her head from her grandfather's bosom. "So I thought once, Sybil; you shall hear how dearly I was taught the contrary."  To every living bein, our intercourse went on apparently the same. At the commencement of a new year, I doubled his salary to remove from him as far a possible, any temptation to commit the like crime again, and although I never trusted him, I never let the fact appear to others, hardly to himself. Once more, he was thoroughly humbled and repentant. I believe now, tlhat fbr that year, I might have trusted him with untold gold, but I did not. -1I watched him, and was always suspicious of him. Still he lived in my family, he sat at my table and around my fireside, and no one could have known   CHESTNUT WOOD.         245 how much secretly I despised him; but my punishment came swiftly. My daughter, my only daugh lter, all I had in the world, loved the man. She told me so; for he did not, she said, know her father. He feared, because he was not great and r    rich, lie would refiise the gift of his child. "She asked me, Sybil, do you hear me, she asked that she : nmight ,be hzis wife, and when in my speechless rage, I threw her ,!-   firom me, she returned, and clung arflound my neck, as you do i-.   now, and said she would never leave me, she would always live with me, only for both their sakes, I must let her love him too.

"It is meet," said her grandfather, speaking slowly, and al- most sternly, ' a daughter's tears should wash away even thle menory of her mother's weakness. Weep freely, Sybil, every tear obliterates a sin, the sin of us both." For some time, the silence of the room was broken only by Sybil's short, convulsive sobs. Mr. Atherton stood looking at her, without making any effort to comfort her; the pain w'hich he suffered from her grief, seemed to him only a slight repar- ation for what he himself had done that was wrong, and contin- -   ually through his mind passed that dread sentence, ' the innocent for the guilty.'"

"I never saw her, Sybil; they made her a grave in the vil- lage churchyard, and I laid her beside her mother. It was all there was tlen left for me to do." "I remember it, I remember it!" said Sybil, starlint sud- denly up ; " she took me )by the ihalnd, and w\e walked on, and she was often sick, ald tired. and sat down to rest; Ilhe .gave me food, but she ate none herself'; she lhad none, I amn sure,"- and a shudder passed over Sybil. "It was very cold, but we did not stop; she said she must go on ; and then she told me- O, I only half reemmber - she said sh-e should die, and I must find some one to help her, and she lay down on the snow ; I remember how mournfully the wind sounded, and how I sat by her, and she lield my hand until they both became so cold we did not know they hlad separated; and then she pointed to a light, and said ' Go there, I cannot go ; you will perish! and tlenl I ran a little way, but not far, and screamed so loud - and when no one heard me, I went again and again, many times, and at last they came, and Mamma Wallace carried us home, and my mother died!

"I y mother's ended, grIandfather," Sybil repeated slowly, '( and no one can ever know what, or how much sle suffered."  "She died of a broken heart; we all know what that means," ' But not what she suffered, grandfather. No one can ever know that."

Tllerefore, I have decided, if Miss Rogers will accompany us, to go abroad for two or three years, until he shall have run through his race, or, at least have found that he must turn his schemes in some other direction. 6 You are in no condition to think this matter over calmly, now; and see, we have talked until the day has nearly gone; now, is my Sybil woman enough, as I hoped, to bear up against all this, or will she let it crush her?" "Grandfather!" said Sybil, speaking slowly, but with an en- ergy and decision akin to his own; (" now, this sorrow is heavier than I can well bear; but to-morrow--hope much for to. morrow; let me go to Aunt M3ary; she always can soothe me best."  "Go, Sybil," said her grandf:ather, kindly ; t" but do not for- get that, though you have neither father or mother, your grand- father still lives." "Dear glandpapa!" was Sybil's only answer; but the tone spoke more than volumes of words." "Say a lymn to me, as you used to do when I was a child," said Sybil, suddenly entering Aunt Mary's room, and seating herself upon the floor, - she placed her- head in Miss Rogrers's lap as she used to do then,--" say a gentle, soothing one, for I am, oh! so tired!" Aunt Mary's work had dropped from her finger as soon as Sybil entered the room; for the last two hours had so changed, that she felt as if she should hardly have recognized her.   CHESTNt"T OOD.        251 The suddenness of her request and action gave her no time to express her surprise; and softly pulling back the long curls whsichl lad iallen on her face, without a moment's hesitation, or a single question, she began to repeat a hymn. i'    SlWhen she had finished, Sybil's head still lay upon her lap, motionless; and she commenced another, and then another; still Sybil lay as if she had fallen into a gentle sleep, and Aunt I Mary's voice sank to its lowest key until, at last, she ceased, and only continued the soothing motion of her hand over the droop- ingll head. An hour or more passed in this way, and when Sybil raised her head and met Aunt Mary's inquiring glance, she said:- "Thank you, Aunt Mary; I feel very much rested; I al- ways love your Lymns; they never seem the same things to me when I read them for myself:" "Have you been asleep, Sybil?" "Asleep! oh! no; I have only been resting."  Resting from what?" "From a long, long talk with grandfather; and he says, Aunt Mary, that he wishes us to go to Europe-for a few years; you will not send me without you, I know." The look of en- treaty with which this was accompanied went to that place, sc very easy for Sybil to find, Aunt Mary's heart; and if the question were to have been decided that moment, Miss Rogers certainly would not have hesitated; as it was, she said:- "I But this seems sudden to me, Sybil; why does he wish to go?" The color came into Sybil's face; "I cannot tell, Aunt Mary you must talk with him; and you must go with us, for my sake." "f How soon do we go?" Sybil noticed that she used the word we, and answered j Quite soon, I think; grandfather made no very definite plar with me: he will probably do that with you; our going I be lieve depends upon your willingness to accompany us."

"Some time since, when we first came to N'ew York, your grandfather mentioned this to me; but it was then proposed to take Mattie, too, and have you both finish your school educa- tion where he could command the best teachers for you ; but he has never spoken of it since, and I had almost fborotten it; very possibly, lie has only been waitingD for a convenient time% and has found it now." Sybil did not answer; she would not even say what was in- directly untrue; but she askedcl:- "Is there any hope that Mattie's parents can be persuaded to let her go with us?" 4"None in the world; and if they were, I, for one, should- not be willing to have the responsibility of taking her; so, Sybil, if you please, do not mention it to your grandfcather ; I pre- sume h 1has quite fborgotten it." "Mattie has done something very serious, to incur your dis. pleasure, I am sure, Aunt Mary," said Sybil inquiringly. "Yes, she has, and she must learn much before I would willingly remove her fi'om her parents agrain." "See, here is a letter which I have received friom her this jnorning, the contents of which are very far from agreeablie to me; shall I read -it to you, or no,- you look weary even yet, so I will tell you the amount of it. "She writes that a young gentleman has come from New York to Hymeswold, to study divinity with herfalther. She describes his dress and person as if she was telling me about some one in whom she was very muchll interested; and thllc winds up the whole with her expressions of undisguised pleas- iure in having, at last, some one who could relieve lher from thhe eternal monotony of a country life.

"Does your letter say that he is in the family?" "I did not notice particularly. I suppose he must be, of courbe, foi' no one of that profession ever is allowed to stay anywhere else." Aunt Maryl, however, looked carefully over Mattie's letter ag ain, and was a little cheered by finding that no such thing was definitely said, and there was, therefore, a hope that it might be otherwise. Still it annoyed her, and made her the - more decidedly resist the pleadings of her own heart and Syb- il's lips, that Mattie might accompany them on their proposed tour. "You will take her away from the young candidate," said Sybil, as her last argument. "Yes; perhaps to lose her where the responsibility would be mine. No, no, Sybil; if a girl cannot be trusted by her- self, all the bars and bolts in the world will not make her safe. Nothing could induce me to remove Mattie from Hymeswold, and even now I shall write a letter full of warnings immediate- ly to my brother." "If I were BMattie, I should prefer that it came to me." "You are right, Sybil; she shall have an opportunity to act for herself, and not be treated too much like a child. Perhaps, after all, I wrong her.

Before the conversation closed, Aunt Mary had given her promise, if nothing occurred during her interview with Mr. Atherton to make lher decide differently, to accompany Sybil abroad; and almost immediately the prospect of leaving, for a time scenes and circumstances which. were so painful to her, be- gan to be pleasant to Sybil, and both her grandfather tand Aunt Mary were astonished by the alacrity and energy with which she entered into the new plans. Mr. Atherton was the more satisfied of the justice of his decision, and Miss Rogers pleased that her own ready consent had added so much to Sybil's happi- ness. The time to leave was soon appointed, and Mr. Atherton put himself to work to make every arrangement with the least pos- sible delay. It was decided that a few days should be spent at Chestnut Wood at first, but then almost immediately, by Sybil's urgent request, that they should not go at all. She did not like leave- taking, there was too great a probability tlhat she parted from some for the last time, and so strong was h]er feeling, thatt Aunt 5Mary was obliged to hurry down, spending only one niglit at the parsonage, though, as it was as yet three weeks before they should sail, she more than half promised to come again. She was the bearer of numberless messages to Sybil, and on her return really rejoiced that Sybil had been saved so much of the pain which she had herself experienced, particularly in leaving old Dinah. "Bless the sweet angel. God bless my dear little Missis. Tell her day and night, night and day, without ceasing, old nigger ptray for her, and pray for Dinah, too, that He will not take her to that hleavenly h1ome, till her eyes once more see the dear child.

And then the negro covered her face with her hands, and swung back and fro in lelr old armn cllair, withl that helplless- ness and almost'dotage which she so often evinced; and Aunt 3.Iary brought the blessing to Sybil, and Sybil treasured it in her heart. 5i I    &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7089-00000129"/> CHAPTER XIV. ONE reason for Miss Rogers's short stay in the country had been her interest in Nancy, and her desire to keep her en- gagement punctually with the woman from whom she hoped to receive information respecting her. There, on the appointed morning, she went again, through the labyrinth of streets, no more quiet or cleanly than on her previous visit, to continue her search. To her disappointment, the woman was not to be seen in the street, and she hesitated some time before she dared go up to the house which she had seen her enter, and inquire for her. Fortunately the woman herself opened the door, and seemed quite surprised when she saw whom it was. "You come earlier than I expected," she said; then, half opening the door, as if struggling between her wish not to be rude and her fear that she was offering an unwelcome courte- sy, she asked: "Will you walk in? I do n't know as you ever go into poor people's houses, and ours is one of the poorest, still you are welcome." "Thank you," said Aunt Mary, stepping in, "I love to visit the poor; but this morning I feel so anxious to find Ann, that I can hardly spare the time to wait long." "Ann M3orton, you called her, did n't you," asked the wo- e   iR;        CHESTNUT WOOD.         257 " man, placing a chair for Miss Rogers, who immediately sat doiwn. t Yes, Ann Morton was the name we always knew ler by." Well; it is just as I suslected; her real name is not that, but Nancy somethng, I don't know what; perhaps she-never lhad but that one." I thought from your, description of her I remembered her, and could find lier; then, if' she had no olbjection, would as soon tell you as not. So after looking about for a day or two, and going often to head-quarters for information, I have succeed- ed in ferreting her out, and I when I told her about you, and asked her if she would see you, at first she said very crossly: 'No, she wanted to be left to die alone ;' but soon after she said, ' She did n't much care; I might tell you where she was, and if you took the trouble to find her out, she was sure she ought to be glad to see you.' So I left her witlout giving her time to chlange her mind again; and now I will go with you, if you are not ashamed of me, and show you where she is. I am almost sure you could not find ller alone, for used as I am to such places, it took me several days to really hunt her up." "Tlilank you," said Aunt Marly, "I should feel very much obliged to you, if you -would s-how me the way." Yi ou will find her very sick. I do n't know as she will be alive; only she appeared to lave consumption, and with that you know a person seems to be dead long befbre they really die. I did what I could to make her comfortable ; but nothing seemed to please her much. Like a great many other sick p1eople, she is very fretful; and though I tried my best, not a single want could I find out from her. I hope you will do better, but I do n't know ; she was always poor and proud, and such folks are very hard to get along with. Now I am ready, if' yon tre," continued the woman, glancing earnestly around, as if tlhere was some reason best known to herself for haste, " and - we shall be there in a few minutes. It's not far; but as ladies 22*  &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7089-00000130"/> 2538         CHESTNUT WOOD. do not often go in that direction, perhaps it will be as well il you put your veil down, and draw your shawl over that watel chain." Aunt Mary, with some slight emotion of fear, did as sl:( was desired, and then the two went out together on their erralul; of mercy. The woman walked so quickly, that Miss Itogers liad a times much difficulty in keelpingl pace witih her; but, as sh said, it was only a short walk, and tIey stopped before a hous( which, to Aunt Mary's great relief, presented at least a respect able exterior. For the ,first time since they had left her house the womar spoke :-- "LYou see," she said, " the house. Go in, up two flight, of stairs, a:nd open the fist door at the head of' thhe secon flillt. That is Nancy's rooln. You will find her thhere, I air sure, for there was too muchll death in!her face wlien I s;1 hler, fibr her ever to move out of doors again.

Miiss Roogers followed her once more, %lwhile she pointed ou1 the most direct waiy to one of the principal streets, then taking lanother direction herself; she left her to return as she best could. Aunt Mary had no difficulty in returning; but when she reached the house, for the first time she felt distrust of' the woman who had led her there, and she went with a trem- bling heart up the stairs, to the room which had been desig- nated. Her knock was so slight, that it probably was not heard, certainly it was not answeredd; and after waiting a moment she knocked again.  See distinctly heard the sound of some one turning in bed, and then a violent fit of coughing which follow-   CHESTNUT WOOD.         259 ed convinced her, that if it was not Nancy, some very sick person was within, and needed assistance. Perhaps it may be remembered how, years ago, before Aunt Mary had gone to live with Sybil, she had been noted for ler fondness of taking care of the sick, and the re- markable adaptation of' helr charlacter to this splhere of useftul- ness. Of late, she had been called upon so little, this part of ler nature was almost a forgotten gift, but the sound of suffer- inl, awakened it at once, and with no more thought of herself, - she opened the door and entered. Upon a small bed lay Nancy, apparently so entirely ex- hausted that lifet was struggling for a momentary existence. She was deadly pale, and her breath came only at intervals, and then with that convulsive effbot which so often indicates dis- solution. To open the window and raise the girl was Miss Roger's first movement, and then to hold her quietly where sihe was until she could breatlhe nlore easily. Tillis she soon did, and, sooner than Aunt Mary had anticilpated, opened her eyes. There was no clhange of expression, no indication of sur- prise, as they fell upon her; sheonly said, in broken words and with much effort :- "I hoped I should die." "You were very near death, Nancy," said Miss Rogers, with much tact diopping, the assumed name by which she had always known her and adopting' her real one; " did my knock startle you?" "Yes," she answered, pettishfy, "yes, very much. I thought he had come, and I turned quickly to tell him he should not come in, and then I began to cough. I wish I!had died. What did you want to touch me for? it was not kind in you." "What have you taken today?" asked Aunt Mary anxious to change the subject.  &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7089-00000131"/> ZttU       -CHESTNUT WOOD.  "Nothing. I do n't want anything but to die. You have come and seen me, and now I wish :you would go away and leave me ; I shall die :ooner alone." "Lut you will let nme mllke you a little more comfortable, I know. I have tie money you earned and Mrs. Giles did not pay you. I thought you might like it for some little things while you are sick." "Who sent you here?" "I came of' my own accord." "Did she know you were coming?" "She; who, Mrs. Giles?" "No, no, not Mrs. Giles; I do n't care anything about her; but Sybil - Miss Sybil, I suppose I slould say." "Yes, Sybil knew it, and would have come with me if I would have allowed her; but I thought she had better not until I found how you were situated." "She would not come." "O1O yes she would, very gladly, if she could do the least thing for you; and now you are feeling a little better, let me move you very carefully over to the other side of the bed, and make this up, for it looks as if it must be uncomfortable." t"You talk kindly," said Nancy, fixing her large dark eyes upon Miss Rogers with a searching look, which made her start. "I am not used to kind words, and they can cheat me easily. If you have any wish to deceive a dying girl--" Nancy," said Miss Rogers, putting back gently the heavy masses of dishevelled black hair from off her fobehead, "Let us understand each other to begin with. What object could I gain by attempting to cheat you now?" "You might want to find out something from me," said Nan- cy, readily. "Such as what?" "Oh, a great many things that I know, and that I think you   CHESTNUT WOOD.          261 suspect; but I tell you I will die first. Die without a drop to drink or a morsel to eat, before I will tell you; and I never broke my word, whatever else I have done." ," Nor will I ever ask you to, Nancy. If you will be con- tent to let me come and take care of you, I will promise you, solemnly, and I, too, never break my word, not to ask about the past. Do we understand each other now? There, be quiet, or you will cough again; now do n't move yourself, and I will soon have a nice cool place all ready for you." Suiting the action to the word, Aunt Mary placed her arms under Nancy's wasted form, and gently changed her position. Then quickly and softly arranging her pillows, and changing the straw, which had become matted and heated under her un- til it both seemed to pierce and burn through her emaciated frame, she put her back again, and the first smile she had ever seen there, lit up Nancy's pale face, and thanked her more than words. "You have eaten nothing, you said, today. Tell me truly, Nancy, have you had anything you could eat?" Nancy shook her head. "Who takes care of you?" "No one; sometimes they come up from below, but not often; I had rather be alone." '6 But who brings you what you want to eat and drink? do you lie here, and suffer for want of them?" "Sometimes, but then I think I shall die all the sooner, and I am glad of it. The woman who brought you here was kind to me, and would have done more but I knew that she was poor and could not afford it; so I scolded her, and made her go away." Miss Rogers now took a survey of the room. It was small, but as usual with everything about Nancy, strictly neat. There was no furniture, but the bedstead upon which she lay, and one  &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7089-00000132"/> 262        CHESTNUT WOOD. chair; but the uncarpeted floor was spotless, and the bed- clothes bore testirony to havingl been recently washed. The clothes which iNancy had broughlt with her from Mr. Atherton's, were folded aid carefurlly laid in the chair, and a pitcher of water standing on the floor beside the bed, fIbormed the only other article Miss Rogers could see. ' Can a larger room be hired in this house, Nancy?" was her first question, after having finished her survey. "Yes, and better'fhrnished; but this is good enoulgh for me; it is all I can pay for. I counted the money I left with Mrs. Giles, and I thoulght if I should be sick lonrg, it would not more tlhan last me." "IHow did you expect to get it?-" "I do n't know ; I came to this house because it is respecta- ble ; though the street is not a good one; I thought if' Sybil should miss me, and wonder what had become of me, in some way she millght find. me out; and perhaps come once, and see me. I thoughllt she would come, because I zwanted to see her so much; I felt as if she must; and I thinl if you had not found me as you did, some day I should lave been driven to have sent fbo her; I do n't know, but I think of her a great deal as I lie here, all day and all nighlt, - -nd no one, not even sleep, comes to me-." "If I go down stairs, can I find any one who will provide you with something to eat?" "Yes; but they will want to be paid first; and my money may not last me. I shall need it more by and by." "But I will gladly pay fbr it."     - "No; I could not eat; I do n't like to thnk of food ;" and Nancy turned away her fiace, with a strong expression of dis- gust. '(I will be back in a fen minutes," said Aunt 3Iary, and slipped away. She easily found the woman who kept the house; and found   CHESTNUT WOOD.         263 her too, pleasant, and willing to do anything for the sick girl, vith a reasonable prospect of being paid. She said she had been there five or six days; and asked for so little, that as they hlad only a ftew boarders, she was willing to take hler in; particularly as she paid a month's rent for tlhe oorn befbrlehand, and was to board herself. Yesterday was the irst day she had not heard her upj and around the room; and lle had just been saying, that she thought she would go and see whether she was sicker; and was about to do so, when she saw the lady enter and go up there herself. "' Have you a larger room that you could let her have?" "* Yes, but not for the same money."  1"Let me see it, will you?" The woman took Aunt Mary into a comfortable apartment on the second floor, with sufficient furniture and a small bit of carpet before the bed. "Here is this," she said; "I never let it but with board, and for so much a week," naming her price. "If I take this room, will you engage to see that the best care is taken'of this sick girl?" "WlVy, as to that, if' she is going to be very sick and die, there will have to be a glreat deal of' running up and down stairs ;- and I should n't like to engage to do it witliout consid- erable more pay." Miss Rogers hesitated; she well knew how much additional care a sick person makes in a hlouse; but she feared, should the knowledge of the cost at which she was living be made known to Nancy, she would never consent to it; so she said to the woman:  '"If you will charge only a little more to Nancy, that is, in ler name. tlhan you do fbo her room above, I will play you befiore- hland all the extra,--but on one condition only, if you neglect her, you sliall refund the money." The landlady readily agreed to these proposais, and with  &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7089-00000133"/> 264        CHESTNUT WOOD.  Miss Ro(ers went immediately to work to make arrangements for her removal. When everything warls ready, and a cup of tea and slice of toast prepared, Aunt Mary took them and re- turned to Nancy's room. 4 I thoulght you had gone," said N-ancy, peevishy, as she en- tered the room; "I Ihoped you hadl; what did you want to come eX again fotr?" then, seeing the waiter in her hand, she saidL:-- "I told you once, I would not eat; I do n't wish to live; if I can't die any other way, I shall starve myself to death ; take it awsay; the very sight of food makes me sick." "If you will drink this tea, and eat this toast," said Aunt Mary, as pleasantly as if she had been gratefully received, "I will bring Sybil to see you to-morrow." The woman turned her head towards her and said, quickly: "6 You are cheating me ; I know you are; you want me to get better, so that you can have me taken up and carried to prison; and I do n't much. care if you do; I liad as soon die there as any where else; so you had better let me alone; you wont-get any good out of it." 6' I could not bring Sybil there," said Aunt Mary; " but she can come here, and will, if you will do as I ask you to, now." "Are you cheating me?" "I told you some time ago, that I had no possible thing to gain by deceiving you; but if you still persist in thinking so, I must go and leave you, for I can do you no good." "Do me good," sai-d Nancy, repeating the words slowly after her; 1" no one ever did me good, no one but Sybil, and she did not know she did, or she would not." "i Sybil will come again, if' you will take this tea." -c Give it to me; if I must, I must; but I had rather die!" At first she swallowed with much difficulty; but her appetite seeming to return to her, she finished the toast like a starved person; and Miss Rogers had the pleasure of setting down an empty waitr.   CHESTNUT WOOD.          265 The, change which the nourishment produced upon Nancy was almost like magic; she raised herself in her bed, and with that short return of strength so common to her disease, asked if she might get up, and go out for a little whle into the fresh air; her room seemed so small and confined to her sometimes, she felt as if she should certainly smother Aunt Mary took cadvantage of this, to tell her of the change which she proposed making fbr her ; and to her great surprise, found Nancy not only willing, but impatient to go immediately. 4 Shze will find it so much pleasanter if she ever comes," she said, and Aunt Mary knew, without aiking, of whom she was speaking. Nancy was delighted with her new room; she was exhausted upon reaching it, but as soon as she was a little rested she looked about, and commented upon each article in it with child- i,1h pleasure. af What a character of extremes!" thought Aunt Mary to herself; " how shall I ever reach her to do that real good which lies so near my heart?" But she had already taken the right way, first to care for hler suffering body, and then the soul. Now, she remained with her until she found her quiet and easy; then, promising to return again on the next day, if no- thing special should happen to prevent, she left her, well satis- fied with her first visit. As she was closing the door, N\ancy called to her:-- "Miss Rogers, do not bring her, if she does not wish to come." "She will wish to, Nancy; make yourself perfectly easy as far as that is concerned; and take what your landlady brings you, without making her any trouble." Nancy promised that she would, and kept her word. When Miss Rogers reached home, she found Sybil again anxiously expecting her return.

When she heard the story, she .was desirous to go at once, taking with them delicacies, sufficient to tempt even a more un- willing appetite than Nancy's; but Miss Rogers would not hear of it until the next day; and Sybil found herself slowly count- ing the hours which must elapse. The next day it rained; Aunt Mary wished to go alone, but Sybil would not consent; so, carefully muffled, they went on foot, not wishing to take their carria(re to such a street. Miss Rogers opened the house door, as she had on the pre- vious day, but with very different feelings, and went softly up to Nancy's room. Remembering the fright which she had given her then, she raised the latch carefully. Nancy had heard the noise, slight as it was, and the look of eager inquiry, which her sharpened and pinched features bore, was very appalling. Sybil involuntarily shrunk back, and Nancy, perceiving the action, at tributed it of course to a very different cause. Covering her face with her hands, as if to shut the sight of S ,ybil from her, she said eagerly: -- "Take her away, I knew she did not wish to cornme. What did you bring her Ibr?" Fortunately Sybil was bothl conscious of the act and of' tlhe feelings it had awakened; therefore going quickly to the side of Nancy's bed, with the sweet voice to which Nancy had ever shoiwn herself so sensitive, she said:- "See, Nancy, what I have brought you! Mrs. Giles made them for you with her own hands. Look, are not they nice? at the same time she uncovered a bas&amp;ket wlicl she had broullght Nwitlh her. "Look, Nancy," said Miss Rogers, as Nancy sliowed no in- clillation to remove lher llands firoln her filce, '  Sybil 1has broulght   CIIESTNUT WOO1).       267 them all the %way firom home for you herself, and it is raining very hard, too." Nancy uncovered her face, and looked at Sybil with so pierc- ing a look, that Sybil with difficulty avoided showing her un- easiness again; but she did not. She playfully held up one of the dainty bits, but Nancy stopped her. "Do you hate me?" she asked sharply. "I feel very sorry for you," said Sybil. "And you do not hate me?" ' "Hate you; certainly I do not. Do not talk so, or look at me so, Nancy ; it almost frightens me." "I do n't wonder; I forgot how much like a ghost I was looking." "And it was because you are so much changed that I start- ed when I first came in. Do you feel very sick today?" 4( No, I am better. I am afraid I am not going to die soon. Do I look to you as if I should?" "I hope you will get well." "What for? I have nothing that makes me want to live."' a You shall come back and live with us." "Never; I have no wish to." Miss Rogers now made many inquiries respecting the time which had elapsed since she was there, and found everything had been attended to, as she desired; and now both Sybil and herself busied themselves in arranging around the room such little articles of comfort as they-had been able to bring with them. There was an abundant supply of clean towels and napkins, and the night caps, the making of which had occupied Sybil during Aunt Mary's first attempt to find Nancy. Two little glass tumblers, whose very prettiness made the medicine more desirable -to the sick, and other things, the necessity of which Aunt Mary well knew.

"Did you come because you wished to," suddenly askedl Nancy, "or because Miss Rogers promised that you slould?" "Because I wished to," said Sybil, Nancy's voice blrealking the spell, and she at once regalinin her composure; "and I have put a little book in my pocket. Miss Rogers said you would like perhaps to have me read to you - slIould you?" "I do n't care." With this ungracious consent, Sybil seated herself near :Nan- cy's bed and began to read the seventh clapter in Matthew. Nancy did not remove her eyes from her face while she was reading, and Sybil found so much difficulty in proceeding, that Aunt Mary offered several times to take her Bible fromlr her; but Nancy always made a gesture of impatience, there- fore Sybil persevered in reading through. "I love to hear you read," said Nancy, as she closed; "is that book the one Miss Rogers calls the Bible?" "Yes, that is God's book," answered M:iss Rocers, solemnly. "I do n't like God," said Nancy, abruptly. "He has not dealt fairly by me." "Oil, Nancy, do not say so," said Aunt Ilary, much shocked. "It is very, very-wrong." "So is everything I do; but I can't help it." "Have you any wish to?" "Of course I have. If God had made me to live-as He has almost every body else in the world, I should n't have been here now dying, and with no wish to live either. I have lhad a very hard and a very unjust life, Miss Rogers, and I do n't feel willing to thank God at all thorit. He hlas been cruel to me." "Nancy, you grieve me much. I do not think you know what you are saying."   CInESTNUT WOOD.        209 "4 Perhaps I do n't, Miss Rogers," and Nancy raised herself up on her elbow, and spoke with much energy, "but I do know this. I have thought about it day after day, and night after night, long before I came here to die. I used to think of it when I was well, and had to sin or starve. You do n't know, Iiss Rogers, you people who have never been poor, you do n't know what it means to have life thrust upon you when you did not want it, and then to have to do everything that you despised and detested so as not to go naked about the streets, or eat your own flesh to satisfy your hunger. You do n't know what it is to grow up to be a woman, and never know certainly that there was a God, until you heard it first from the lips of a little stolen child, who was praying." "Do you think, Miss Rogers, if you never had wished to sin, and had been all your lifetime forced to, you would love God? No, no!" and Nancy's eyes literally flashed fire from their angry balls; "you would, good and pious as your are now, you would do as I do--hate him." "Nancy, this is awful blasphemy; I cannot allow it where we are," said Aunt Mary, decidedly. "You don't realize what you are saying. Do you think God chose you out from amonC all the million of creatures whom lie lhas made, to be specially unhappy?" "Yes," said Nancy, " he made me with a heart that would have loved to be good, and like good people, and then put me where I could only be wicked and miserable.

"The day after death, when we give an account to God for 7 all that we have done while living."  "And then the Judge drew on the black cap," said kNIancy, with much scorn in her voice. "He condemns the sin which he has made. It is very just, very honorable. Heavy laden!  Who made me heavy laden, Miss Rogers?           !

"For me?" and Nancy uttered a shrill, mocking laugIh, which made both Miss Rogers and Sybil start; "God cursed    me, and Chlrist died to save me."

"Yes, we all have," continued Sybil; "but listen, Nancy, ' He died that we might have rest,' that is, forgiveness for sins, and after death be happy forever with him in heaven." "Who is Christ? I mean my Saviour." H He is the Son of God." "Does -God say so?" "Yes, every where in his Bible."  I wish I could read; I would try to learn about it when you are away, and I am here all alone. I don't like to think about God, it always makes me feel very angry; but this Saviour seems different to me." "Think of the verse which I llave said to you, now, Nancy,' said Miss Rogers, "and to-morrow I will come again, and read to you." Nancy's eyes looled inquiringly at Sybil, and she imme- diately said: "Yes, I will come, too, Nancy, and until thlen you must promise to repeat the verse, and think much of your Saviour." 4 I shall, I shall," repeated the girl eagerly. 4' I have a feel- ing, now that I have found what I wanted. O, Sybil, you would pity me, if you knew what it was to live here, hour after hour, full of pain, but not thinking of that, - to see all around the room when your eyes are shut, and when they are open, a long narrow grave all dark and cold, and a God looking down with such an angry face right into it!

"Yes," said Nancy; and Sybil repeated it. "Ever liveth?" asked Nancy, as Sybil finished. "Yes, and that is a great comfort. lie can never die!" Nancy laid quietly back upon her pillow, without asking another question; and Miss Rogers and Sybil soon took their leave. "Oh! Sybil," said Aunt Mary, whose pious heart was stirred from its very depths with sympathy for the poor girl that thev had just left; " what would become of us, poor sinful children of earth, if it were not for our Saviour. It seems to me I never felt as I do to-day; how needful his gentle mission was to our humanity; how great a difference separated between us and a just God! And if you had not been there, I should1 have spent all my time in endeavoring to convince Na ncy that God is just." "Better to win her to think so through the gift of a Saviolur, dear Aunt Mary; Niancy has known so little kindness duringl her life, that no fear of evil will affect her; nothing can reach, but what meets her." "We must both pray fbr her, Sybil, for her days are drawing fast to a close; and in what a dreadful state of mind she is, to appear before her God." "God is merciful," said Sybil, in her low, ringing voice; "Christ died for her! I do believe, Aunt Iary, she will have   CnESTNUT WOOD.          27T that happiness in another life which she has never found here." "i Not without sincere repentance." "She has sincerely repented; she was in the dark, and could not approach an offended God; she needed her Saviour" . "( Perhaps you are right, Sybil; God knows, and all we can do is to pray for her." It may be readily imagined, that neither Aunt Mary or Sybil thought of much else beside Nancy; and though quite busy making preparation for their expected tour, they found time to collect many little things which'would enliven her sick room, and suggest to her pleasant. thoughts. A small, but very fine painting of the head of our Saviour, was made ready to take to her, and hang beside her bed, where her eye could easily rest upon it when she lay waking. This, Sybil had asked leave of her. grandfather to take, and had also made him acquainted with the connection Nancy had had with her early abduction from Chestnut Wood, and of her remorse and unhappy state of mind now that she was so near death. There was much about it which Mr. Atherton could not under- stand. He could imagine no reason for her seeking to live with them as she had, nor for her sudden leave taking, unless she was connected still with Sybil's father, in which case he con- sidered it highly imprudent for Sybil to go to visit her, and would have entirely forbidden it, had not Sybil pleaded with more tlhan usual'earnestness, when she divined from her grand- father's face what he was about to say ; and he finally consent- ed, only on condition that she should promise never to go, unless accompanied by both Nep and Aunt Mary. This, Sybil was very willing to do, for to confess the truth, she had struggled with and overcome many fears before she had ventured upon her first visit. Sybil repeated to her grandfather every word of Nancy's conversation, and it was at the close of this, that she ventured  &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7089-00000138"/> 274        CHESTNUT WOODI to ask for the head, which she knew he valued so much as a work of art. "It will be stolen by some of them and sold for brandy, as like as not, Sybil," was his answer. "There is no one there-now, but Nancy, grandfather." "That is more than you know; and beside, some one else may come any time. That painting would bring a large price if any one knew its value. Still, I have no objection to your taking it, if it will be a comfort to the girl. But take care what theology you teach her; it is rather a dangerous piece of business for a young girl like you." "I do not teach her any theology, I only tell her of her Saviour; and that is all a dying person needs," said Sybil, solemnly. "Does she understand you, do you think, Sybil?" Perfectly; I wish you could have seen how differently she looked.' "Do you understand it all yourself'?" Aunt Mary began to look very uneasy; but Sybil had shown herself; on the day before, so true in her religious feel- ings, that she determined to trust her again. "It seems to me so very simple, that I do not think you are asking' me a sober question, grandfather." "What is it the Bible says? 'A wayfaring man, though a fool, need not err therein;' but notice, Sybil, it is only to the unthinking that this knowledge is promised." "Because faith is the soul of religion," said Miss Bogers, timidly, unable any longer to withhold her comments. "Faith is a broad term, Miss Rogers," said Mr. Atherton, seemingly quite willing to continue the discussion with her; will you define it?" "Belief in God, and in Christ as the Son of God," answered Aunt Mary, readily. "In other words, Miss Rogers, a willingness to take every   CHESTNUT WOOD.         275 thing upon trust, demanding neither reason nor explana- tion. "' These things are hidden from the wise and prudent and revealed unto babes.' 'If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God."' "The Bible is certainly a book from which very apposite quotations can be made," said Mr. Atherton, politely, and im- mediately changed the subject. That day the picture was sent to Nancy's room; and when Miss Rogers and Sybil, accompanied by Nep, reached there, they found it already hung upon a nail directly opposite Nan- cy's bed, and her eyes were riveted upon it. "Is that the Saviour of whom you told me?" she asked, the moment she saw Sybil. "I have been thinking of Him, and when the woman who brought it up spelled out the name under it, I felt sure she must be right, for it had in it so much of the look I have seen all night." "Do you know, Sybil, that instead of God's angry face, one like that, so sorry, and yet so kind, has looked down into my grave all night, and this morning; I do n't know, but I am not so angry with God. It was good in Him to let his Son come, when he might have prevented it if he had been a mind to. Are you sure that this is all true, Sybil?" "Very sure; you need not be afraid to trust your eternity upon it, Nancy." "Sit down by me, then, and read to me; I have been listen- ing ever since day broke for you to come; I have thlught of nothing else but about that Saviour." While Sybil was opening her Bible, Miss Rogers made some inquiries about Nancy's cough and pain in her side. "Bad, Miss Rogers, very bad," said Nancy; " but I think little of them; I can bear any pain of my body, if my mind is only a little easier.

The excitement through which she had passed  I Iad racked her feeble body, until Miss Rogers, as she lookled  carefully at her, saw plainly that her life was ebbing near its  close.                            . Silent, but fervent, were the prayers which she offeresd b fo the soul so soon to stand before its Maker; and the solemn, earnest faces of the three, in that sick room, would have made a scene which, without one word of explanation, would ha-c e revealed its own character,.           1 Miss Rolgers, with bler upturned look of supplication; NancyJ : with the finger of death writingr upon her face, - but with that  eager eye, just beginning to discern the dim vision of' a-other life, breaking through the clouds and darkness of this, the first faint glimmer of the Star in the East; and Sy bil, like the  angel who appeared of old, to guide through the imperfect light of the star, to where the young child was. Day after day these visits were repeated; atnd day by dayy  although her body grew very sensibly weaker, Nancy's hleas became strong in faith on the Son of God. "My Saviour--and he will forgive me--he will blot out  my sins---he will receive me into glory! Sybil, Sybil, if I ever realize it! I shall be already to go! but I cannot, quite-- I it is too good! too much!"

I, Nancy ; can you be- lieve it, Sybil? You do not know what a Saviour means; you have, never sinned as I have; O, how I should love him ; how T shall, when I feel sure that I may." "' Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted,' said Aunt Mary, solemnly; "Christ is not fear from you, Nancy, and God stands waiting, to forgive and bless you. God is gracious, and full of long suffering, and of tender mercy; he would nots that any should perish, but that all shall lhave eternal life."' "u I do not think much of God; I hope he will be nmercifuil to me, and forglive me for his Son's sake, and teach me to feel right toward him; I cannot do so myself; I try very hard, but it is all dark and cold without my Saviour." "The penalty of the broken law," said Aunt Mary. "No, not that; but I can't feel, unless I think of Christ, that God was just; I hope I may. Do n't let me talk about it now; I want to hear of my Saviour." Three weeks had passed, and the time of sailing was near at hand. Both Miss Rogers and Sybil begged that it might be delayed while Nancy should live; it did not seem likely that it could be much longer; but to leave her now would have been very trying to them both. Mr. Atherton was slow in giving his consent. He did not like the sad, anxious faces which came back to him every day from the sick room. He was uneasy at the risk to which, he could not but feel, Sybil was daily exposed; and he would gladly have put an end to it all; but he felt that a week's delay granted could probably do no great harm, and would soften the natural regret which all feel when leaving their native land. Therefore, he reluctantly consented to wait a few days longer; and the visits upon which all had learned so much to deepend, were not interrupted.

Slowly she  returned home, and in the solitude of her own chamber prayed  God to give this lesson of the frailty and uncertainty of human  life so deep a place within her heart, that no event of the future  should ever obliterate it; and to make that reIigion truly hers,  which could triumph over doubt, and at last comfort and con-  Aole a poor lost cllildl, like Nancy. It was night be(fore Iissl Roger s returned. Nancy had par- tially revived, and had beel colSious of her near approach to  Clcath; but had beged lher not to leave her while she lived;   CHEsSTNUT WOOD         27'9 so she had only come home for a few moments, to relieve them of any anxiety they might feel on her account, and should re- turn and spend the night. 1Mr. Atherton said, Mrs. Giles must accompany her; and al- though any such act of kindness was certainly very far from Mrs. Giles's wish, yet she had been too long accustomed to obey, to hesitate now, and very sulkily and unwillingly she pre- pared to go. Miss Rogers made several attempts to hasten her; but find- inc that each effort only brought new delay, she sat quietly down to await her pleasure. When. at last ready, a much longer time had elapsed than Aunt Mary had intended should, and she hurried M-TIrs. Giles along, when in the street, at a much faster pace than the old lady was often accustomed to walk. When they reached the house, AMiss Rogers felt much anxiety as to what might have taken place during her absence; and when she opened the door was not a little startled to see the figure of a very old and deformed woman standing by the bed. She wore a thick dress, an old shawl crossed in front and tied tightly in knots on the back, and a black hood, which was drawn down over her face. She did not move as they entered, and Mrs. Giles alarmed beyond her power of self-control, uttered a scream and ran from the room. She heard the scream, and turning slowly round, pointed with a short deformed arm toward the bed, and said:- "I was her mother, but she is dead! dead! Do you hear Me?  she is dead!" She uttered a loud cry, neither wail or laugh, but partaking, strangely  of the nature  of both,- then burst out in a mourn- fil voice, with: - "Och, Nancy, darlint; O, my child, my child, and your mother it is, it is, tlat is standing by you, and you do not  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7089-00000141"/> 2,0        CHtESTNUT tWOOD, speak to her; you never loved her; but I was your mother for all that; and day and night I have sought ye.

With another unearthly shriek she darted from the room; and as Miss Rogers stood rooted with terror to the spot, she thou ht she heard the same sound again, and again, until it died away in the noise of the city. Nancy was indeed dead; whether the sudden entrance of Old Moll had hastened the event, or whether she was dead be- fore her mother came, Miss Rogers of course never knew. All that remained for her to do now,' was to perform the last sad offices; and, in this, after much hesitation, she persuadedl Mrs. Giles to assist her; and leaving every necessary direction with the landlady, who had proved herself kind and attentive, she returned home, promising to return with a clergyman on the morrow, that the poor girl might receive a Christian burial, And on the next day, now more willingly accompanied by Mrs. Giles, she stood over Naney's coffin, and dropped upon the lifeless form the only tear that had ever fallen for the dead girl. "Poor Nancy," she thought; " yours has been, indeed, a hard life; a wild, fierce, bWt brief strurrggle. God has had mercy on you, and you are now at rest!" "Thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ." ;   CHAPTER    V. THERE was now nothing to detain them any longer, and thle bustle of preparation for immediate departure began. Furniture and pictures were sent back to Chestnut Wood. Mrs .   MGles. Macngy, and John were to be left to oversee the house, and render the property secure from any further at- tempt at robbery, Jerry was to continue his supervision as usu- al, and everything seemed to Mr. Atherton to be most satisfac- torily arranfgeld . ISattie had earnestly entreated to be allowed to come to tlhe city to see them off; but no one excepting Sybil was inclined to favor the proposal, and she did not come. -5Ir. Atherton had written a very kind and generous note to Charles, making, every arrangement for him while lhe wa. gone, and promising him, after he lad finished his college stud- ies, if lie should choose a profession, the advantages of com- pleting the course in Europe, but he had not invited the young man to New York, in his heart being desirous to save both Sybil and himself the pain of parting. But as Charles read the letter through and througli again, lie would have given every expression of kind interest and every generous offel'. Cor one line inviting, him to say " good-bye." He tried to persuade himself it was an unintentional omis- sion, and that all would be as glad to see him as he would'to 24*  &#xD;<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7089-00000142"/> %BOZ        (NIEISTNUT WOO1.             see them; but Sybil's note, hle could nlot forget it; indeed, it  had not been off his heart one moment since he had received it. Charles's college course, during the last year, had not been i as successful as the previous ones. Iis mind was not only preoccupied, but much of the time harassed. Ambition lhad  lost its charm ; and the young man, just starting in life, man- I ly and earnest as lhe mighlt have been, seemed inclined to pause I in Iis course, as if already the combat had been too hard for s himn.  The college officers could find no fault with him, for he was prompt and punctual in the performance of all his duties; but there was no one with whom he came closely in contact but missed the spirit of the boy. His vacation was to commence the day -before the one on which Mr. Atherton's family were to leave; and with too strong a desire to see Sybil to be overcome, he suddenly resolved to go to New York,. mingle with the crowd upon the ship, andc without allowing himself to be seen or known, take one last look at her before she should be lost to him. There was more of desperation than anything else in the young man's heart, when, having carried his plan into execu- tion, he found himself, at a very early hour in the morning, standingr on the deck of the vessel, watchinfg with the minutest care every arrangement that was making for its departure. Little groups began soon to gather around him. Some were to go, and their friends had come upon deck with them, to put off as long as possible the pain of parting; others had come with the prospect of at some future time being voyagers, to ac- custom themselves to the look of sea and ship; and others, had come with that restless idleness, which always likes to see ac- tion but never itself' to act. It was late in, the season, but Charles stood wrapt in his cloak, with his hat drawn down, and his face partly covered by the standing collar of the cloak. He had grown in every ESV"C L.1    IVK   CHESTNUT VOOUD.         283 wiay, and he had no fear that any of Mr. Atherton's party would discover,- or even suspect whho he was. For two hours he watched with such eager anxiety fbr their coninig, that at last he began to tlink he must have made some mistake, and he took out Mr. Atherton's letter to assure him- self that the name of the ship and the date of sailing was as he had remembered it. He was so much engaged in reading it over, that he did not see the arrival of the party, and his first notice of it was Sybil's voice beside him. He involuntarily started and with much difficulty resisted the inclination to grasp her hand as she passed him, but in an in- stant some one came between them, and when he recovered himself she was gone. The few minutes while they were visiting their state rooms seemed like hours to Charles; and when they came once more upon deck, Charles placed himself where he copld see, without, as he thought, being seen. Tile three were entirely alone, not even Jerry or Nep hav- ing been alllowed to accompany them from the house. Mr. . Ath- erton disliked scenes, even such as they would have been like- ly to have made, and Sybil loved not partings. As Charles noticed this, he drew his cloak closer about him and retreated a little farther from sight; but, no matter how eagerly he listened, he could not catch one of those silver tones; he could only see the face, so still, so sad, and yet so beautiful. He stood gazing upon it until, as if under the influence of a spell which he could no longer resist, he moved toward her, near enough to listen to her voice. She was conversing eagerly with Aunt Mary of Nancy, and Charles was  startled to find how often the words s sickness and death " reached his ear, without his hearing the connecting clauses of the sentence. "Who had been sick and died?"   He moved nearer still  &#xD;<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7089-00000143"/> 284        CHESTKU' WOOOD. to learn, and as he was bending eagerly forward, borgetting his disguise in his anxiety, Sybil looked up and their eyes met. She would not probably have recognized him, if the color had not rushed so suddenly into his face'; as it was, she had not an instant's doubt, and eNtending her hand eagerly to him, she said:- "Charles, why Charles!" There was too much pleasure in the tone to leave him one doubt. Seizing her hand, he said:-  "Forgive me, Sybil, I could not let you go without seeing you once more." Neither was there anything equivocal in Aunt Mary's wel- come. In truth her heart had longed to see him, and it was one of the saddest things in leaving, that she could not do so; but Mr. Atherton turned coldly toward him, and Charles read his displeasure in an instant. "Believe me, Mfr. Atherton," he said, "I came on deck with- out the slightest intention of being seen or known by any one. I would not have intruded in this way for the world." The expression of pain in the young man's face told how truly he spoke; and after a moment's close scrutiny, Mr. Ath- ton said, more kindly than any one had dared to expect:- "But nevertheless, Charles, you do not seem to regret very muchll eing seen and kriown." "Only because it displeases you, sir, and because I came uninvited." B ut it seenis not unwished, if I may judge from yrour re-. ception." A smile lit up Charles's flce, a look of such unmistakable delilght, that Mr. Atherton even was not stern enough to' wish to see it change, so he walked away from the little group, and busied himself in looking around the ship, while they dr(ew much attention toward themselves by the many eager questions which were to be asked and answered.   CHZESTNUT WOOD.         285 Suddenly it occurred to Aunt Mary that it might be as well to leave the young people alone together for a few minutes, and making a very awkward excuse, which fortunately no one heard, or noticed if they did, she went to her state room. Mri. Atherton watcled the movement from a distant part of the ship, but in his heart did not object to it. Left alone together, Sybil and Charles became almost im- mediately silent, a very painful silence, which each tried sever- al times very ineffectually to break. "Time and tide wait for no man," and both were now hurry- ing them on to their parting, and the moments were laden with much of future joy or sorrow to them. The consciousness of this at last compelled Charles to say, but with a voice so changed by emotion, that Sybil would never have recognized it:-  "Sybil, do you regret at all leaving me. Should you feel sorry if we never met again?" "Never, Charles, do not say such a cruel word; nothing but death could part us." "Bless you, Sybil," said Charles so eagerly that the old gentleman pacing with slow steps directly in fiont of them stopped and looked at him, as if wondering what it all meant. I was afraid- that is, I thought- I dreaded to hear you say, you did not care, you did not mind leaving me." "Not mind it, Charles!" and Sybil's eyes were fixed with such an expression of wonder upon him, " why should I not mind it, as you do?" "Because, Sybil, you do not love me as I do you. Because life without me is life to you, and to me it is one long, dull, dead existence; because you are happy away from me, and I am miserable when you are gone." "Sybil's eyes had fallen. The color came at first slowly and very painfully into her face, thenwith a sudden rush, dyed  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7089-00000144"/> 286        CHESTNUT WOOD. cheek and neck of deepest crimson, and the tears began' to gathl er in her eyes. "I pain you, Sybil; I see I do," said Charles, quickly, "Forgive me, I was hurried on; I did not mean to grieve yo u; 1 hoped it would not, to know how dearly I love you, how pain- fhl it is to me to have you- leave me, and the fear I have that something may separate us from this hour. I do not know why I fear this, but I do. It has haunted me of late, Sybil. You will not love me, I shall lose you, and I would die sooner." The tears fell like rain from Sybil's eyes, and she bent her head over in a vain hope of concealing them. "Tell me, Sybil," said Charles, deeply grieved by the sight of her tears, " why is it so painful to you to hear that I love you. Tell me, I entreat you?" Sybil was still silent, and Charles said eagcerly: - "You are unkind, Sybil. If' you cannot love me, if you never have, stay so; anything is easier to be borne than this suspense. Tell me truly, and fear not, Sybil, I shall meet it like a man." "Charles," said Sybil, and her voice thrilled throulgh and throughl his heart, "I must not love you if' I would. Go and forget me." The young man had risen, and forgetful of all around him, he bent closely over Sybil to lose no word of his sentence. As she finished, he drew himself up to his full height, and in a voice so clanged again that it retained hardly a trace of its own tones, he said, with one of those hasty impulses so natural to him:- "s Sybil Thornton, you trifle with me; you have'long trifled with me; farewell, forever." "Farewell," said Sybil, extending her hand once more lo- wards him; "I have never trifled with you; but forgive and forget me." "Forget you! God help me, I never can."   CIIESTNUT WOOD.         287 There was so much agony in his voice, that long, long after he had left her, Sybil heard it above the roar of the -waves. She heard it sighing with the wind through the cordage of the vessel, she caught it dying away with the distant swell of the waters. It broke upon her car in the silence of midnighllt, and haunted her like a thing of life through the long, lonely hours of their voyage. Charles had left the vessel abruptly. It was a termination of the interview which Mr. Atherton had anticipated, and the pain of which he had wished to spare them both. He knew that, situated as Sybil now wras, with all the uncertainties which attended her father's future course, and the disgrace which law would visit upon him for his past transgressions, she would never consent to involve any one she loved in such try- ing circumstances, and yet they were of such a nature that they could not even be told. Thereupon, when Charles, with- out noticing him, brushed hastily past him on his way out of the vessel, he only turned and said coolly to himself: - "Better thus, young man, or you would share the curse; yet it is to me one more disappointment in a life filled with them." When Aunt Mary hlad finished her very necessary arrange- ments in her state-room, she thought it would be safe, as it wanted only a few minutes of time to, sail, to come out and bid Charles good-bye. To her astonishment she fobund him gone, and Sybil sitting alone, in tears. Wisely she asked no questions, and made no comment. There had been that in Sybil's connection with Charles which she did not understand, and of course with her partial knowledge could not approve, and if she had spoken now what she felt, there would have been much said to have added to Sybil's unhappiness. A s it was, she made no effort to comfort her, and late in the night she heard the sound of vainly suppressed sobs from her narrow bertlh. And so the noble vessel bore them swiftly away friom their  &#xD;<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7089-00000145"/> 288         CHESTNUT WOO1.  native land, but bore also many sources of solrow and regret. If we could leave our pains and take our pleasures only with us, whlat a moving world would this be. Time would seem to have turned back its wheel, and broughlt again those wild, migsratory days, when man's tent, pitched anew every night, was his only holne, and to drink each day by the bordelrs of (a new stream his greatest ambition. On to new scenes, to a new life went the family from Chest- nut Wood, and back to his old haunts, but with the sun dark- ened and the stars giving no light, went the dreaming, ambi- tious young man. Charles sought hi-s home in Charlton, but there was nothing in the pale, sad, absent-minded youth to remind his parents of their glad-hearted boy. His mother blamed herself, most unjustly, for that selfish ambition, which would not be contented to see him useful and happy in his father's sphere. If' "l knowledge was power," she felt very certain that power was-not Iiappiness; and she watched this, "her summer child," with an anxious scrutiny, which only a mother knows how to use. But the young man buried his sorrow  deep within his own heart, nor suspected how close and prying was the gaze that sought to read the secret. No one can understand a son like a good, loving mother. It matters not whether he be yet a boy, or have grown to the full maturity of manhood, that secret and mysterious link which God has mlade reaches from heart to heart, and gently over it the mother glides into the holy of holies. kNot to profane it! oh no; a rude step never enters there; but to bring forth precious oil, wherewith to lighten and gladden the p)ath of the sonl's life. A  mother's loss is great to all her children; but t o her sons it 1s irreparable, and the mantle of charity should ever be borne in hand, to cover the failings of the early motherless. Now after a few days' close observation, Mrs. Wallace de-   CHESTNUT WOOD.         289 cided, that the trouble lay in disappointment; and following up one thing after another, she became thoroughly convinced of his love for Sybil, and of its unfortunate termination. She loved Sybil too well to cherish any desire to blame her. She regretted it, but had years argo, when she had foreseen the possibility of such a thing, made up her mind, that the heiress of Chestnut Wood would never be allowed to marry the farmer boy of Charlton. To be sure there had sometimes been a hope that when the farmer boy was lost in the successful and fame- crowned professional man, the distance between them might be less; but even this vague hope disappeared now before the certainty of an offered and a rejected love. With characteristic independence, she wished and proposed to Charles, that he should allow his father to pay the remaining expenses incident upon his education; but Charles had given his word to the contrary, and would not retract, though his wounded heart, strong pride and his mother plead loudly for the contrary. Tlhis was a part of his nature which his mother could not understand; it found a much more ready response in his fath- er's quiet but manly heart. Mrs. Wallace was never weary in forming plans for Charles's amusement. She would walk and ride with him, and sit pa- tiently by the hour, sometimes without her work, for fear of disturbing him by getting it, and hear him read books which she could neither appreciate nor be interested in, all with the hope of seeing him look less sad, all, if she might only see one of those old smiles again. Among  her -other expedients for his entertainment, she pro- posed that he should go to Hymeswold and see Jerry, also Mr. and Mrs. Rogers and Mattie.  She did not utter the name of Chestnut Wood, but she thought if he would once go there, he would bring back a far less acute state of feeling. True there would be much to remind him of his loss, but if he was at all VOL.

This, she hoped, might in some measure be the --result of a visit to Hymeswold, and to her great pleasure, she found him quite ready and willing to under- take it, and for the first time during his whole life, she saw him leave home with an almost undisguised pleasure. He could not but think frequently of her happy face as lie went on to- ward H-ymeswold. He had made no plan as to his visit. He went almost me- chanically, because his mother wished it and he had nothing else to do with his time. Therefore when he entered the Ris- in, Sun, he almost mechanically seated himself, and in a very listless way, began to think over the different times, and under what different circumstances he had been there before. The last time was when lie came down to see 31r. Langdon; and  now the particulars of their interview came more and more distinctly to his mind, and with that vividness which the associations of place are apt to give, many things almost for- gotten were brought fieshy to mind, and now, -as then, was forced upon him the conviction, that in some way this man, contemptible as he seemed, came between Sybil and himself. As   these reflections, none too agreeable, were passing  through his mind, lie saw the figure of a young man pass be- fbre his door, dressed in black, and with a few books, carried in a  most student like manner under his arm. He started, for there was something about him which reminded him imme- diately of the person of whom he was thinking. But a moment's reflection convinced him that the resemblance must be wholly imaginary, and the young man with the books belonged to a very different kind of a world. His entrance had the effect of arousing him from his reverie, and reminding him of the friends whom he had at least ostensibly come to see.   CHESTNUT WOOD.          291 His first call was at the parsonage, where every one had a warm reception ready for him. The minister, because his hopes of seeing young men enter upon his sacred profession had been suddenly awakened by the candidate for orders studying with him, and he only needed the ri lght circumstances to make him a zealous proselyter. Charles was undoubtedly a young man of very promising talent, and would make 6" a burning and a shining light." iMrs. Rogers was fond of gentlemen's society from a girl, and even now always put on her cap with her brightest pink rib- bons and her brightest smiles when one was to be their guest. Mattie inherited much of this fondness from her mother and her long acquaintance with Charles made him to her one of the most welcome of guests. There was much to tell and much to hear; and now Mr. Atherton had gone, and Mattie no longer stood in fear of him, she improved the first oppor- tunity of being alone with him, to give him a full account of the robbery at Chestnut Wood, her own visit there, and all the attendant circumstances. Of course they lost none of their in- terest or point from her lively recital, and furnished matter for close, and rather whispered conversation, which nevertheless reached, and pleased the quick ear of Mrs. Rogers. Matrimonial speculations were the only ones in which the worthy lady felt at liberty to indulge, and in these she carried on quite a trade. Not a minister who had been " afflicted" within fifty miles of Hymeswold but knew to whom he must apply to have 6 the sorrow made more easy to be borne." Not a spinster lady, or a lady whose claims not to be considered such were at all doubtful, but cultivated a very close intimacy with the minister's wife, and sometimes, in strictest confidence, imparted to her the treasured secret of her heart. So happy was Mrs. Rogers in her own matrimonial connec- tion, that she could hardly imagine the possibility of a life with-  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7089-00000147"/> 292        CHESTNUT WOOD. out. ' She would sooner," she often said so, " die than not have a husband. Why, what was there, what could there be, to live for without?"The greatest stretch of her imagination was unable to conceive of such a thing; 1" she would as soon be a camel wandering alone upon one of the great Sahara des- erts; she would as soon be a lone boat, tossed in a tempest upon a winter sea; she would as soon be the flower 'born to blush unseen, and waste its sweetness in the desert air;" and so the good lady invariably became grandiloquent, and nev- er could be exhausted on this exhaustless theme. As l!Mattie grew into the years and stature of a woman, many an anxious thought had her mother given to her future. '; How should she marry her?" She asked herself this more firequently than any other question; and, alas, for lier peace of' mind, it was one by no means easily answered. On the appearance of the candidate, she had canvassed his claims to be considered at any future time in this light pretty thoroughly; but althouth he was to be a minister, and that was the promise of the best thing in the world, yet there was some- thing about him to which her mother's heart could not quite assent, and she discussed the matter in a very guarded manner with her husband. Ie, however, did not seem disposed to favor the young man much more strongly than she did. "He takes a great many books from my library, bu1 wihen I try to talk with him about them, he always say-s. ' I have not read that one yet, I have been busy upon another.' " "Why do n't you ask him about that, then?" quickly asked Mrs. Rogers. "Because, my dear, I am sure," said Mr. Rogers, hesitating- ly, "I do n't know any particular reason, but that he usually mentions one with which I am not so familiar as I was some years ago." A picture of a young man, seated in his room in a theological   CHESTNUT WOOD.          298 seminary flitted for a moment before Mrs. Rogers's eyes, but she did not reply, and after a short silence 1Mr. Rogers said: -- (6 There is one thing certain about it; how much the young man may study, I cannot as yet discover; but there is one thing he does, which my books do not give me an opportunity to doubt."- "'What is that?" asked his wife, eagerly. "Smoke; they always come home filled with cigar smoke." The worthy minister's face wore an expression of disgust which testified, better than any words, his dislike of the habit; and Mrs. Rogers was noted for her open and untiring hostility to- ward it, so they now looked at each other with an expression of anxiety plainly depicted on the countenances of both. "If' any of the people should want -to borrow those'books, what would they think?" asked Mrs. Rogers. "I do n't know," was her husband's laconic reply. "(But you must know, husband ; and y6u must take some measures immediately to prevent this; why, your whole library, to say nothing of your character, will be entirely ruined if you let it go on. Hlow does it sound: The Rev. Mr. Rogers of Hymeswold's books smell of cigars?" These last three words Mrs. Rogers pronounced something in the same way in which she would have read an indictment for murder. The minister was exceedingly annoyed, especially as llis wife went on to insist, that he should request the candi- date to use more discretion in the indulgence of his habits. As Mr. Rogers demurred, the task of finding fault being one very foreign to his nature, Mrs. RogTers grew more decided in her fieeling that it must be done, and if the flame of family dis- Cord could have been very easily lighted, it would have kindled brightly now, firom the smoke of the cigar. There was one way, however, of ending all such differences; either the hus- band or wife announced the determination of doing as they 25*  &#xD;<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7089-00000148"/> 294         CHESTNUT WOOD. thought best, without reference to the opinion of the other; a threat which never was put in execution. Now, Mrs. Rogers said: "Sir. Rogers could do as he pleased, but she should inform the young man what her feelings were with regard to the subject ;" and Mr. Roogers said.:- "She could do as she thought best; " and thus, amicably, the dispute ended. But not so the impression which it left upon their minds. The new candidate was very sensitive; and he soon felt, for some reason wholly unknown to himself, there had come a chance over the feelings of the minister and his wife, with regard to him. He redoubled his exertions to please; he never was absent from a meeting of any kind; but, alas! the scent of cigars still lingered around his theology, and the nasal organs of both 5Mr. and 1Mrs. Rogers had also become very acute. Things were in this state when Charles arrived at the par- sonage, and his appearance was hailed as most opportune by all parties. liMrs. Rogers had another string to her bow; and her dreams of' the wedded life of Mattie began to assume more the reality of a waking vision. Charles's first interview with the candidate by no means promised much for their future intercourse. He at once recognized the student he had seen at the Rising Sun; but, although the personal appearance was so different firom Langdon's, still, something about the man constantly and unpleasantly reminded him of him, and his manner toward him, was both cold and constrained. It proved, however, no check to his easy familiarity with Mattie; and she became very uneasy at the constant-little jars which were taking place between them. Once, too, she caulight an expression upon the candidate's face, which did not please her. She thought it over and over to herself; and, for the first time a misgiving, whether she had done right in concealing the   CHESTNUT WOOD.         295 real nature of' the young man's character, disturbed and began to trouble her. So fair, during his residence in Hymeswold, she had had but little to do with him. To be sure, she had walked frequently with him, but never farl from the village, and then, when at home, her mother took care that they should not be left long alone together. She had not made up her own mind as to the propriety of an engagement, and an "ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure" had always been her favorite maxim. The slight, nervous feeling of responsibility which Mattie had felt at first, insensibly wore away, as everything proceeded with so much regularity and quiet; and she was quite congrat- ulating herself upon the discretion she had shown, when Charles came to visit them. But a new phase was now put upon the matter. Suppose Charles should discover who the supposed candidate was, and should ask her, what should she say, or what should she do? To hope that matters would proceed now, as quietly as they had, was to hope against reason; and Mattie was already beginning to suffer the penalty for her connivance at deception,-to speak very lightly of her part in ,the affair. The candidate would do to amuse a lonely hour, but his ca- pacity for doing even that, was fast becomiing a matter of ques- tion; and as he could not for a moment come into competition with the handsome, talented college student, Mattie found her- self beginning to show decided marks of preference, before she was conscious that she had indulged any. There was nothing in this to displease either father or mother; and Charles was entertained, and wiled away from many a gloomy thought, or sad memory, by the never failing vivacity of Mattie's lively heart. They walked together, without regard to the distance from the little village of Hymeswold, and as often found themselves straying by the borders of Pomp's pond, or sitting with Dinah in her pleasant cottage, as in the dusty streets of the quiet village.  &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7089-00000149"/> 296        CHESTNUT WOOD. Every spot associated with Sybil was pleasant to Charles; and Mattie loved to talk of her as freely and as fondly as the mnost ardent lover could desire. One visit they made to Chestnult Wood, and one only; Charles's mother was right; under its stately shadow, Sybil became its owner, the young heiress, and the distance between her and himself grew immeasurable. He began to wonder at his own temerity in having loved her; at his boldness in hav- ing dared to tell her so; and that shadow, from those high walls, fell colder and darker upon his heart than upon the green grass, for from thence, at times, the happy sunbeams chased it away. Where they had wandered when they were children, hand in hand; where they had sat, side by side, upon the soft turf; where they had talked, and played, and loved each other -in all these spots Charles delighted to linger and to speak of her; for there, in memory at least, she was still his own; and he could clasp the little loving beautiful child to his manly heart, and forget that she was no longer his, that she was in truth the rich, absent heiress of Chestnut Wood. This kind of life grew every day more and more fascinating to him. He could be happy in the past, and the present was so filled with its memories, that it almost smiled upon him as it went rapidly by. Mattie never wearied of the theme more than he did him- self; and so, insensibly their two hearts, through another, ap- proached each other; and Mattie, with her warm, generous feel- ings, loved Charles none the less that lie loved Sybil, too. Was Mattie conscious how she began to love him? Cer- tainly not; she had never loved before, and what young love recognizes the mystery of its birth? She only listened fbr his step, for the first sound of his voice; she was not conscious that the one quickened the motion of her heart, and the other sent its blood tingling so quickly to her cheek. She knew, too, that   CHESTNUT WOOD.         297 she wearied of the candidate's presence, that she felt like a guilty, condemned thing before him, and turned away, whenever he spoke to her, with a dislike which she could not conceal. He saw it; so did her father and mother; and so would Charles, if he had not been too much occupied with his own thoughts. It may be supposed that this change in affairs was not alto- gether pleasant to Billings. His plan in assuming the dis- guise he had, and coming again to Hymeswold, was in no way to be advanced by it; and after all, he was eminently a man of "oize idea." No scheme which he had laid for some time past seemed to prosper. His connection with Brown and Brown's compan- ions had become entangled, owing to their discovery of certain little pieces of perfidy, which he had flattered himself he had most skilfully concealed; and as honor is said to be an invio- lable law among those who break all other laws, he had been somewhat summarily dismissed from their confederacy. Of course Nancy, under such circumstances, did not feel obliged to fulfil her part in the compact she had made with him, and even if this had not taken place, he soon found her growing attachment to Sybil a stronger hold than that which he had upon her. Losing with her all hope of reaching Sybil by any artifice which she could plan for him, he had determin- ed to go to Hymeswold, enter Mr. Rogers's family, and quietly watch, for a little while, the course of events. He had known of Brown's visit to Chestnut Wood, and of its object, and also that he had failed in finding the paper lie sought. It was to secure this, and to see if Mattie could be won over to favor his designs, that he had come to the place on the day of her visit there. The result of their interview is already known, and he was just beginning to tire of the dull monotony of his life, and his flirtation with Mattie, as it seemed in no wise to for-  &#xD;<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7089-00000150"/> 298        CHESTNUT W-OOD ward his plans with regard to Sybil,-when he was astonished by the intelligence of Mr. Atherton's determination to take his family abroad, and while as yet undecided as to what he should next do, Charles fortunately came to the parsonage; and so Charles's visit became rather an epoch in the lives of all. Billings had that kind of quick instinct, by which a man of- ten gains a reputation for sagacity, if not for judgment. He could see the means for bringing about an end, and though of- ten at fault as to the effect of final issue upon his plans and wishes, seldom failed to hurry on the catastrophe, whatever it might be. Now, after much, and for him quite deep, reflec- tion, he resolved to cast a bold die for his success, and to win or lose all. Following up his plan, he. endeavored for some days unsuc- cessfully to see. Charles alone; but Charles so naturally avoided him, that he found it almost impossible, and he was about ask- ing, in a manner which would demand notice at least, fbr an in- terview, when chance threw the opportunity in the way. He had gone out to drive to a neighboring town. When about half the distance there he saw Charles before him, mak- ing his way with that straightforward, energetic wralk, which had characterized him friom a boy. Stopping his horse as he came opposite him, he asked him to ride, an offer which Charles at once very coldly refused ; but Billings felt that it was now or never, and therefore said:- "I have a communication I have for sometime been wishing to make to you, Mr. Wallace, and shall be very glad if you will allow me to do so now." "I do not know," said Charles, hesitating, and looking in no very genial mood, "of anything in particular which you can have to say to me." "If you did, there would be no need of my informing you, I   CHESTNUT WOOD.         299 suppose," said Billings, with a sneer, "but now you must take nmy w ord of honor as a minister and a gentleman that I have things of much interest and importance to to to you." Charles had difficulty to keep from repeating the word "hon- or" after him, but did not. uWith an effort to conquer his nat- ural repugnance he stepped into the carriage, and the horse started slowly forward. "Were you going in any particular direction?" inquired Billings. "None ; I was only out for a walk." "Will you go to ----, I have a little business there?" ("Yes, it makes no difference only so the ride is not too long;  and now will you oblige me by telling me your business." "It is not so easily told as asked. It has an ugly sound about part of it, and beside, I must have from you a strict promise that you will not reveal it. , If you had said that before, you might have saved your- self the trouble of taking me up. I never make such prom- ises." "But you will make this, and not regret it either, when you hear all I have to say." "I shall not make it; nor can I imagine any inducement suf- ficient to wring one from me." ,INot even a full knowledge of what has seemed to you so singular in the conduct of Sybil Thornton?" asked Billings, boldly. This unexpected mention of Sybil's name, as he had an- ticipated, threw Charles entirely off his guard, and he said eagerly: - "' Sybil Thornton! what can you know of her?" ' Much, as you shall hear, when I have the required prom- ise." "I will not promise," said Charles, in a voice which betok-  &#xD;<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7089-00000151"/> 300        CHESTNUT WOOD. ened the pain it cost him; " there is something wrong about it, or you would not require it I' "Very well, as you please; I can keep what I know to my- self. I do n't think I should gain anything by telling you; I only thought, as you had been so much in love with the girl, you might like to know some things which are of' importance to her, if not to you." Charles had been looking so steadily in the candidate's face while he was speaking that in spite of his efforts to the contra- ry, Billings found himself changing color, and shrinking into as little space as he could conveniently occupy. "I ought to know you," said Charles, as he finished. "I have suspected from the first that I had seen you before, now I feel certain. No one in this world has ever felt at liberty to speak of Sybil Thornton as you do but the person that used to call himself Mr. Frederick Langdon." "You are cuter .than I thought you," said Billings, who im- mediately saw no further effort at concealment possible; " if you had waited a few moments, I should have introduced my- self to you as an old acquaintance; but now I do n't see but one thing to do, that is, to give you the whole story, and let you tell it if you dare." Charles felt the blood flow suddenly away from his heart, but he did not speak. "I may as well," continued Billings, " begin at the begin- ning, because a part would be worse than the whole; and if you find it grows dull, why, I am ready to stop any time, only let me know." Charles made an impatient gesture, and he went on. "About the very first part of it I do n't know much. Brown always grew fierce and cross whenever I tried to worm it out of him; but so much I do know, that he used to be in Atherton's employment when he was in business, and committed a crime,   CHESTNUT WOOD.         301 for which Mr. Atherton dismissed him. I do n't know wheth- er it was before he married his daughter, his only child I think she was, nor do I know what ever became of her. I dare say she died, and that after her death her child, this same Sybil Thornton, was sent to live with her grandfather. About this time, the time the child went to Chestnut Wood, I entered into business with her father, and we found that a little girl of her age, if she was pretty and smart, would be a great help to us. Brown hesitated for some time about it. He said if the old man should mean in the end to leave the child his money, it would be greater gain to snap him off and 'get it all through the child; but at last 'he decided that there was no hope of any such thing, that he was a man who never forgave, and so we had better have the girl, and get what good we could out of her." A convulsive heaving of Charles's chest for an instant was the only thing to show he had not suddenly been changed into stone. Billings was too interested himself in his story to no- tice it, therefore he went on. "We came down here from New York to reconnoitre, saw the child, and found she was exactly what we wanted, but either that great black brute of a dog or something else prevented our catching her. Brown, too, was good for nothing unless he was nearly drunk; he was always giving out and getting mad, so one day I came down myself with this understanding: if I brought her up without harming her in any way, when she grew to be a few years older, I should have her for my wife." "Villian! liar!" exclaimed Charles, seizing the reins from Billings's hand, and nearly throwing the horse down upon his haunches by the violence with which he reined him up. Glaring at Billings with a face fearfully livid with rage, he was unable to articulate another word. "God have mercy on me," he exclaimed at length, "I can- not keep myself from murdering you." VOL.

Billings knew his danger, and the blood forsook his cheek, and all the easy assurance with which he had hitherto gone on with his story, fled from his coward heart. Pale and trembling, he would, had it been possible, have thrown himself upon his knees and prayed for life; but Charles was spared even the disgrace of touching him, for by a great effort he suddenly callned himself, and said in a quiet tone, returning the reins:-- "Go on, your story is not yet finished." Billings grasped the reins convulsively, and after two or three ineffectual attempts to speak, during which Charles never for a moment removed his eyes from him, he said:- "I don't - I - I - don't remember what I was telling you about; you are so fierce and cross you frighten me most to death. I don't see what is the use," he continued, shaking him- self as if to be assured that he still retained his personal identity, "6 in getting into such a breeze, there wont any good come out of it, I am sure of ,that." "( Go on with your story," interrupted Charles, authorita- tively. "When I get ready to," answered Billings, peevishy; " you frightened me so, I do n't know where I was, or what I was talking about." "You were saying," repeated Charles, slowly, " that you in- tended to marry Sybil Thornton." "So I was, I remember now ; and if you interrupt me again, you may finish your story. "Well, I went down, and did as I always said I should. I was alone, got the child, and came back with her; but there was such a hue and cry raised after her, that no good ever came of it, and before we could get quietly to work again, somehow or other the child ran away, and the next we heard of her she was back at Chestnut Wood. I proposed making another attempt, but no one would hear of it, so we got on without her; but there was no use ever trying to do much with   CHESTNUT WOOD"'         303 Brown. He grew worse and worse every year; and at last, things got to such a pass that I came down here to get money from Sybil Thornton, to save him from starving. I know enough things about her father, to put him in states prison for life, or hang him either; and so I have told her many times; but now I have got a hold upon them both, which, as you have always seemed to have a fancy for the girl, you may as well know first as last." Charles almost held his breath, so dreadful was the suspense to him; but Billings, without looking at him, continued:- "Once, she put some, money for her father in old Dinah's house. I went there fobr it, but could n't get a word about it out of the old fool; so her father had to get along as he could, though he always accused me of having stolen it, until she told him where she had put it. Then he came posting down here for it, and thinking he would kill two birds with one stone, he went to the house at Chestnut Wood, and tried to find a paper in Mr. Atherton's possession, by which the old man could at any time send him to prison - state prison, I mean. '"Of course, he didn't find it; he was probably either too angry, or had drank too much. I found out about it from him, and choosing my time, came down. Miss Rogers was in the house when I went to see how I could get in. That man of Mr. Atherton's had made every thing very fast; but I watched the girl and saw where she came out; so I easily went in, and taking my time about it, found the paper the night before Mr. Atherton came down from New York. "I don't wonder Brown wanted to get possession of it; it is an ugly thing; I can do anything I please with it; but I am in no particular hurry about it; I can wait, for now I am cer- tain nothing can prevent my marrying Sybil Thornton when I I i  please,"    ( Why not?" asked Charles, in so calm a voice, that its very quiet, so little consonant with his feelings, startled him.  &#xD;<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7089-00000153"/> 304        CHESTNUT WOOD. ' Because, all I shall say is simply this: Sybil Thorntoll, here is this paper; it will hang your father. If you don't be- lieve me, you can ask your grandfather; he will tell you every word I say is true. Now, the very hour after we are married you shall have it, and you may burn it if you please; but if you do not marry me, I will hand it over to the nearest magis- trate, and you can have the very comfortable feeling that you have hung your own father. "A very straight forward affair; I don't see as anything can be said against it; and I thought you might as well know it, for it seemed -a pity to me to have a likely young fellow like you whining after one girl, whom you never could get, when there were some others to be had for the asking." The self-satisfied leer with which he looked into Charles's face, liked to have proved too much for him again. With diffi- culty he restrained himself from his inclination to do him some great bodily injury; but he did remain still, without even ven- turing upon a comment. "-You see," said Billings, after waiting some time in vain, "why I said you would not tell, even if you did not promise; besides caring so much fobr the girl, you are under some kind of obligations to the grandfather, I hear, and it would not look very well fbr you to bring disgrace upon them. I don't' sup- pose either of' them would think it very kindly if they thought you knew; but that is none of my business, it is only your look-out.' "What do you intend to do now?" asked Charles. "I don't exactly know. I am thinking some of following them abroad, and being married there; but I don't know. I don't like the water very well, and I feel quite easy about the end. Perhaps you will get used to it, and like it better the more you think of it; at any rate, you can't but think it is kind of me to let you know a little what you are to depend utpon." - .X.   CHESTNUT WOOD.         305 "Have you finished?" asked Charles, breaking the long si- lence which followed, as they approached the village of 3I. "Yes; I believe you know all that it is necessary you should." "Then let me get out from your carriage; I certainly can- not resist much longer my intense desire to break this whip over your shoulders, or to murder you; and know, for your comfort, that I believe worse of you, now, than when I called you a villain and a liar. I believe you are the meanest being that draws the breath of life a contemptible coward; and do your best, fiend as you are, you will never succeed in marrying Sybil Thornton." Billings mechanically stopped the horse. He was no less re- lieved than Charles, by parting company; but it was well for him, that, in the excited state in which Charles then was, he did not hear the taunting laugh which he sent after-him, when he considered the distance between them sufficient to insure his own personal safety. "He did not ask me one word," he said to himself, " of the reasons why I am here studying as a candidate for holy orders, with- the Rev. Mr. Rogers; and I guess it is about as well for me, for I have shot a bold enough arrow for one day; though I did not preach in a very definite manner. "Now, I suppose Hymeswold will soon be too hot to hold me, and after putting one more arrow in my quiver I will try somewhere else., He will never tell, never; I would rather trust him than the parson's daughter, any time." With such comfbrtable reflections, he went about executing the business which had brought him hither; and on his return to Hymeswold, was not much surprised to hear that Charles had left, to return in a few days to college. This was all the better for the consummation of his plans; and here again, he showed that natural cunning which so often made him suc- cessful. 26*  &#xD;<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7089-00000154"/> 306        CHESTNUT WOOD. Iie found Mattie alone, and in tears. There was no occa- sion to inquire the cause; he knew well what it; was; so he said, carelessly:-- "I have been having a long ride with Mr. Wallace, and a very pleasant one, too. He always seemed reserved before you, but when we are alone together he speaks very confidentially." "Does he?" said Mattie, the rich color mounting into her cheeks; I did not know as he ever spoke very freely to any one?." "I suppose it depends somewhat upon his subject." - "What were you talking about?" ,( What will you give me to know?" "Not much," said Mattie, with a pretty toss of the head; "I dare say it was upon some theological subject, or discussing Latin and Greek." "Very cold tleology; such perhaps as your father talked once to your mother; but certainly not much like what he preaches from his pulpit. Our theology was rather earthly in its nature. We were talking of you." "Of me!" said Mattie, with a start. "Yes; is there anything very strange in that? I led the subject to you, because I saw very plainly that it would please the young gentleman." Mattie's heart gave a delighted flutter; and she could not conceal the pleasure with which she asked:- ," What were you saying about me?" "O, nothing very special; only Mr. Wallace seemed to have a fear that I should interfere between yourself and him, be- cause he said ' he had no doubt, as your father was a minister they would prefer to see the profession kept up in the family."' A look of absolute dislike darted from Mattie's eyes, as she said: - "And what did you tell him?" O, my answer was a very straight forward one; I am en-   CHESTNUT WOOD.         307 gaged to another young lady. I don't know as I have inform- ed you of it before, have I?" "4 No, I think not," said Mattie, hardly knowing what she said; " that is, I do n't remember that you have." "4 I dare say not; I hardly like to be forward in speaking of such things, but in talking today with Mr. Wallace, it was only giving him confidence for confidence. He was asking me what I thought his chances of being accepted by you were, if he were to offer himself." Mattie could not have spoken a word to have saved her life; she dared not even raise her eyes, and she had the mor- tification of knowing that Billings's eyes were fixed upon her, endeavorin(g to read her thoughts. '"I do n't know but what I was wrong," he said, hesitatingly, "but I really thought you did not dislike him. Perhaps I was mtistaken." Mrs., Rogers had been listening for sometime at the parlor door, to make sure of the topic of their conversation, but al- most unconsciously they had fallen into a low tone, and she soon found that she could distinguish little beside the voice of the speaker, and that that had so fair been almost entirely the candidate's. It was just possible he, might be practising in a religious exhortation, but Mattie was too volatile to listen so long in silence to any sober topic; it was possible, more, it - was probable, that the candidate was pleading another cause. The thought was not entirely pleasant to Mrs. Rogers, so just at this moment she opened the door and entered. She was too near-sighted to see the faces of either distinctly, but she felt, by that mysterious influence which always tells of the presence of the gentlest feeling, that something was being said of love, if not of marriage, so she looked for her knitting, and very deliberately sat down. The candidate was discomfited, Mattie annoyed; but if Mrs. Rogers had seen it all distinctly, it would not have shaken her  &#xD;<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7089-00000155"/> 808        CHIESTNUT WOOD. determination. She was resolved not to allow even a flirta tion. Billings staid a short time, hoping some domestic care would call her away; but no, she would not have stirred even for the sound of breaking china, and at length, too vexed to be very polite, he went away. "There! I am heartily glad he has gone," exclaimed iMrs. Rogers, looking after him from the window, to make sure that the dim shadow she saw moving away was actually he; " what has he been talking to you about, Matilda Rogers?" "Nothing very particular, mother." "That was not what I asked; I wish to know precisely what he said." "And not a single precise word can I possibly remember, mother mine. I wonder if you will always expect me to re- peat to you every conversation with every young gentleman I see." Certainly, Matilda Rogers; I expect, as your mother, to know everything you do-or say." Mattie was amused in spite of her vexation, and could not refrain from a hearty laugh, which, however, did not divert her mother from her purpose. "You may laugh, Matilda, but that will not prevent my in- sisting upon knowing upon no what you have been holding such a long conversation fobr in so low a tone." "How did you know it was low, mother?" asked Mattie, quizzically. The color came into Mrs. Rogers's face, old as she was. For once she had fairly betrayed herself; so she said:- "I can generally hear the voices from the parlor distinctly in the kitchen." '"When you are listening, mother, but not if you are attend-. ing to your own business. However, there is no use to keep )   CHESTNUT WOOD.         309 you in suspense any longer. The candidate has been telling me - what do you think, mother?" "I shall never consent to it, Matilda Rogers, never, nor your father either," said Mrs. Rogers, in a very excited manner. "Consent to what, mother?" "Why, to your marrying him. You need not think of such a thing, I tell you now, to start with. ("And I tell you now, to end with, mother," said Mattie, breaking into an uncontrollable fit of merriment, " that he is already engaged." "Engaged! engaged, Matilda Rogers! you will break my heart. You are the most cruel, unkind cllild I ever saw. En- gaged," and Mrs. Rogers's tears began to flow, "without so much as asking our consent; engaged to him, when there is Charles Wallace, who loves you, and would have been so much better," and now a hearty burst of tears quite relieved the lady's overburdened feelings. "Noxw, mother, don't be foolish," said Mattie, ceasing to laugh when she saw  her mother really was troubled. "You did not understand what I said. I told you ]he was engaged; but he and I are two very different persons ;, and I am not the only young lady in the world, if I am your only child." "What! what is it!" said her mother, beginning to compre- hend slightly what was said; "engaged to somebody else, some other young lady?" "Yes, mother; is there any great harm in that?" "Certainly not; but who is it?" "That is precisely what I cannot tell you, and what, if you had not come in as you did, I should probably have found out." "I wonder who it can be?" said Mrs. Rogers, hastily wiping away the tears, of which she began to feel a little ashamed. "I do n't know." "Whom do you guess?" "I can't even guess. I never saw him speak to a lady but  &#xD;<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7089-00000156"/> 310         CHESTNUT WOOD. Miss Palmy Fitch or Old Dinah since he had been in Hymes- wold." "Of course it is neither of these," said 1Mrs. Rogers, smiling as readily as she had wept; " only think of it, Mattie; I am ashamed of you." But notwithstanding the mortification she felt, Mrs. Rogers repeated the whole conversation that night to her husband, as indicative of much smartness in Mattie; and the two fell asleep, wondering to whom the candidate really could be engaged. They did not regret hearing, on the next day, that he was to go for a few weeks to the city, neither did Mattie, for her own heart was beginning to weave many bright and beautiful chap- lets, wherewith to deck a happy picture; and not a leaf or a bud but gave her so much pleasure, that she loved to beguile her hours with admiring their beauty and fragrance, nor fear to have her bright, waking dreams broken by the presence of one, who had of late become almost a dreaded visitor. Mat- tie's consciousness of the deceit which she was practicing made her constantly uneasy, and it was, therefore, no slight relief to have the necessity fbr it removed. And so they were left once more alone at the parsonage, and Billings and Charles went on to pursue their different courses in life, wherever they might lead them."   CHAPTER XwV. BILLINGS returned, as he had proposed, to the city. Once more his star seemed to be in the ascendant, and he heartily congratulated himself upon the bold cunning which had put so many favorable events in train. The possession of the note which Brown had forged upon Mr. Atherton, and which Mr. Atherton had always preserved as a means of'keeping a check upon hs son-in-law, which would prevent his ever becoming specially troublesome to him, became to Billings's fancy a source of almost incalculable advantage. By means of it, he could at any time wring sums of money from  Brown, and, more than money, he could see the strong, bold man tremble and cower before him, as he had so many times done himself before his superior strength of mind and body. It is always the most contemptible characters who are the most fond of power; and now Billings would not have sold that which the paper gave him over Brown, for untold wealth. He meant, however, to make it a means of both, and there was something in the very character of Brown which made him particularly open and tulnerable to such attacks. The theology which Billings had studied while in'the country had been, how to bring the weapon to act against Brown, and yet himself remain in safety, person- a  I cowardice being the only trait which offered the slightest op- position to his avariciousness and love of power. Nor had  &#xD;<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC7089-00000157"/> 312        CHESTNUT  0ooD. this formed his only study. He had certainly now a hold upon Sybil, greater than he could have acquired in any other way. He had seen enough of her to know that her filial feelings were strong, and therefore controlling, and that they would often lead her, as they had already, to many courses of action, which under other circumstances she would wholly condemn. Now he fancied the knowledge, that to the honor of both her parents, for of course her mother's was in her father's keeping, it was in his power to attach a lasting stain, and that nothing should prevent his doing so but her hand in marriage, would carry with it a conviction of its necessity, which she would not be able to resist. Already in fancy he was the master of Chest- nut Wood, already the beautiful and gifted Sybil was his bride - his - there was nothing to him of pleasure in the thought, nothing but money and power. Surely the night had only pre- ceded a glorious morning to him, there was no living being up- on whom the sun of prosperity was dawning more cloudlessly. He was too impatient to await Sybil's return from abroad. She was already of a suitable marrigge age, and the sooner the whole affair was consummated the better for him. He would raise sufficient money from Brown to cross the ocean, seek her in Europe, and return with her as his wife whenever it should suit his convenience. Immediately after his return to the city he sought his old haunts, and found, as he expected, his former companions, and Brown among them. They all received him coldly, and not- withstanding his protestations of innocence and fealty, refused to make him acquainted with their affairs. Irritated by this, he took the first opportunity of making Brown acquainted with his own discovery and possession of the paper and the secret, and of the way in which he intended to make use of them. Brown heard him in silence at first) then, as he went on to 1   CHESTNUJT WOOD.  313 increase his insolent demands - turning upon him as a wolf at bay sometimes turns upon its pursuers, he Said:- "Try it, and I will murder you." There was murder in his eye. Billings felt the blood leave his cheek, and his knees knocked together. Brown saw it, and laughed. "A pretty fellow, you, for my son-in-law, and grandson of Mr. Atherton, husband of the rich heiress of Chestnut Wood. Noah Billings-that is one of your names, I believe; pray, is it the one youqr mother gave you?" "The name is well enough, for all that I see," muttered Billings m "Yes; much too good for the man who bears it - -u py, coward, liar, traitor, any of these apply much better than a name which can by any possibility, have a Mr..put before it." "All this," said Billings, beginning to gain a little more courage, don't affect this matter, as I know of. It was not my name, but yours, that seems to be in danger from the paper I found, and a pretty round sum of money it will take to keep mne still," "What will buy you??" asked Brown, with another murder- ous glance from his eye. Billings named the sum, it was not a small one; but Brown heard it without a, comment. Will  you join us, and honestly do your best, until I can get enough of my own share to pay you?" "I have no objection; I don't care to be idle; money never comes amiss; if you are having a  good run  of luck, I Shall not object for the present." "Done, then; is it?" "Done!"  answered Billings; and from that moment, Billings was   received back into confidence, and never before had proved an abler or more efficient coadjutor. While thus actively engaged in his old pursuits, he did not forget his future plans, and in order that everything might be VOL.

In the letter he informed Sybil of the facts, as he had pre- viously planned he should; and also told her, that some time ' within the year he should be abroad, with the certainty that she would no longer feel at liberty to slight his proposal of making her his wife. He was very much relieved when this letter had actually gone ; for he had more dread of making known his wishes to Sybil, personally, than of any other part of the business. There was something in the curl of her lip, and the flash of her eye, which made him very uncomfortable; it reminded him of her father; and he longed for the time when he should have the right to compel her to restrain them. He also inforrmed her of Charles's engagement, as he was pleased to call it, with Mattie, and of their mutual happiness. The operations of the band of counterfeiters had become now so bold and successful, so disastrous to public interest, that more than usual attention was called to it. Stringent laws were put into operation, the whole police force was called out, and every exertion made to ferret out their hiding place. Large rewards were offered, and as the difficulty of stopping the false cur- rency increased, the rewards were doubled, until they became very tempting to those who love gold. - Of course, every member of the band was more careful, and more on the alert; but their measures had been so successfully laid, that, in spite of the watchful eyes, their bills were kept inl universal circulation, and their returns were great. Brown had rapidly accumulated the sum which he had promised Billings; and had appointed the tiLne and place for delivering it, - with only one. peculiarity at which Billings hbad often wondered, and which had given him an opportunity of making boundless plans fobr the future.

He had never stated any length of period for which the *'hush money" was to be paid; and Billings would feel at lib- erty to use his power at any time he pleased; but fbr once, he showed his want of shrewdness, and fatally miscalculated his man. Brown had, notwithstanding his apparent unconcern, been most excessively annoyed by the forged note being in the pos- session of Billings; and had laid his plans quietly, but with- out mercy or one feeling of hesitation. 'He shall richly deserve his fate," he said to himself, ' and then he shall have it." In one of the darkest and most dismal lanes of the city, there stood a high and dilapidated store. One of its gable ends had fallen in, and of its chimney, nothing was left but here and there a brick to attest where it had once been. Some two or three of the windows that fronted the street could boast of sash- es, but not a pane of glass remained, these having been long since the sport of the boys to destroy. Two or three heavy wooden shutters, hanging by one hinge, showed how much pains had once been taken to make the build- ing secure, and the half beaten-in door, with its strong but rusty iron bars, told the same-tale. It was a building belonging to an estate, the heirs of which were now and had been for years, contesting their claims at law. The owner hi4ving been an unmarried man, and having died without making a will, the whole property seemed likely to go to ruin before any one should rightfully possess it. Since his death the store had never been let; indeed, the houses near it rented with difficulty, for a foolish belief in its being haunted gave a bad character to the neighborhood, and only those wlio were compelled by the direst necessity, liked to be near it. It was said that at some early period, after its building, a clerk had nrur- dered his master in the counting-room, to possess himself of  &#xD;<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7089-00000159"/> 316        CHESTNUT WOOD. some large sums of money which he knew he then had, and that, having buried the body in the cellar, hle had quitted the country; but the poor spiri't awith its murder still unrevenged, walked nightly around the rooms, and groaned most piteously when it came to the spot where it had met its fate. Those persons who owned property in the street would gladly have given double the worth of the building, if they could have purchased it, and finished the work of destruction which time had so ably begun; but this, of course, they were unable to do, and there it stood, dark, desolate, and gloomy, an object of vexation or terror to all who noticed it as they passed. In this same building, up four flights of stairs, was a small room, which had in former times been used as a place fbr de- positing their choicest goods. It was in better repair than any other part. The floor was still whole, and the window which looked out upon the back of the house was unbroken - all hut two panes of glass, and those were carefully replaced by pieces of' stiff brown paper. Two stout locks upon the door showed marks of having been recently fixed, and three old chairs and a wooden table told that it was not always uninhabited. Some pieces of sail-cloth, grown heavy with the damp and mould of years, an old hat, not a vestige of whose original color remained, and a pair of shrunken anld yawning boots gave such an appearance of age to the room, that any one coming in would only have been surprised that the furniture retained suf- ficient of strength and youth to be able to stand; and it seemed now, as if it could be the home only of rats, mice, and evelry other imaglinable kind of vermin. But one night, as the sun was throwing his slanting rays for the last time in through the dusty window, lighting up the gray walls with something more akin to a smile than often visited their dingy countenances, the door hastily opened, and a man entered.   CHESTNUT WOOD.         317 He looked around with a quick, scrutinizing glance, which seeming to satisfy him, he turned one of the keys in the door, and drawing his chair to the window, sat down. He still kept his hat upon his head; and after remaining for some time in one position, as if absorbed in some deep reverie, he rose, and having carefully secured the other lock, lifted the old sailcloth, and brushing away the dust with a sudden and forcible motion of his hand, pushed down a board, from under which he took a box, and then returned the board to its former place, without leaving a trace of having been removed. Tile contents of the box were soon spread upon the table. They consisted of large piles of bills, and a number of delicate engraving instruments. The bills he took up, one from each pile, and holding them carefully up-to the light, examined them in every part. He seemed well pleased, fbr a grim smile of' satisfaction played over his features, and he removed his hat. As he did so, his long, dark hair fell over his broad, ample forehead, and the whole contour of his head displayed what phrenologists would call a fine intellectual development; but alas for the man; a sensual expression beamed from his eye, and determin- ed hardihood lurked in the corners of his mouth. The intel- lect made subordinate to the gratification of the senses - it is a common story, but none the less sad for its frequent -occur- rence. Whatever his mental abilities might naturally have been adapted to, they seemed now fully absorbed in the business be- fore him, nor did he look up or move from it until a step uponl the stairs, and the low knacking upon each one by whch it was accompanied, made him leave his seat, listen cautiously at tihe door, and after replying to a few words which were spoken firom the outside, undo the bolts. The man who entered was somewhat younger than himself, with a frank, open, and good humored countenance, and withal 27*  &#xD;<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC7089-00000160"/> 318         CHESTNUT WOOD. a shrewd expression, which so tempered the other, as to give the idea of energy and yet caution. "Well, Harris," said the- elder, as soon as he entered and the doors were once more safely secured, " what luck?" Harris did not answer, but pulling out a long, soiled, leather purse, the contents, gold and silver, rang on the table, as he poured them out. "Well done! bravo!" shouted the elder joyfully, as he be- gan to count the money. If Billings returns with as much, we shall have done a good business for to night, at least. Here, you count my money while I reckon yours." Harris, still without speaking, began to tell over the money, and when the two had finished, they looked at each other witli infinite satisfaction. "I will tell you what," said the first comer, if we have sucl luck a little longer, I can afford to renounce my business and turn honest man. What say you, Harris; after that pile of bills," pointing to those he had taken firom the box, " are dis- posed of, suppose we give- up, and live like other men." - "Ha! ha!" laughed out Harris, in a loud, rough laugh, "when Ned Brown turns honest man, those who have not quite so much turning to do can afford to think of it; but it is best to wait until then." "I tell you, Harris," said Brown, "I am in earnest about it. I am heartily tired of living this life." "How long since, man?" asked Harris, good naturedly. "How long! oh, many, imany weary years," answered Brown, leaning his head upon his hand, and looking at the piles of gold as if he was looking through them to something else. "I can tell you what, it is one thing to be alone, as you are, and to always have been alofie as you have, and another and a very different one, to have some other life, some gentle, beautiful being, that suffers every time you sin. To see her grow pale day after day, and day after day, and to know all   CHESTNUT WOOD.          319 the time that it is what you are doing that is killing her, and yet not to be able to stop; to see her die, or to hear that she is dead, and be sure that you have killed her, and then to live on long years, full of sin, full of crime, full of misery, and then to find that another being, your own child perhaps, is stung with shame and grief because you are her father. To take away the light and joy of her young heart, and to know, that but- for you she might be happy. More than that, to ex- pose her to insult, and of your own accord to bring her into circumstances that make every drop of manly blood left in your heart proclaim you traitor." "Great God!" exclaimed the wretched man, suddenly ris- ing and beginning to pace up and down the narrow room, I wonder I can think of' it all and retain my senses. Where is the brandy? Give it to me quickly, or I shall kill myself." Harris handed him the bottle. These moods were nothing new to him, though of late they had been of more frequent recurrence; but a long draught from the bottle commonly quiet- ed the voice of conscience, and Harris expected to see the same effect follow now ; but he was in part mistaken. The cause for Brown's present disturbance of feeling lay far deeper than even he was aware. Brown resumed his seat at the table, and commenced again counting the money, and when Harris thought him sufficiently quiet to venture a question, he said: Vi   "Is it not time for Billings; he is generally very punctu- J'  al, particularly if there is money to receive. What in the world are you to hand over to him such a sum as that for?" "Count it," said Brown, pushing the gold towards him, " he shall see it to the utmost farthing."'  "But what is it all for?"' "It is 'hush money;' do you understand?" said Brown fiercely. "He has ferretted out one of my secrets, and I buy his silence."  &#xD;<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC7089-00000161"/> 320        CHESTNUT WOOD. "Better beat him. It would answer every purpose," said Harris. "Hush! I hear him. WaEch him closely to night. Re- member, do n't take your eye off from him when he is not looking at you." There was the sound of steps again upon the stairs, and the same low knocks with which Harris had announced his ap- proach. The watchword was given, the door again opened, and Billings entered. "Well," said Brown, in the same way in which he had ac- costed Harris, "What luck?" "I More than any of you," said Billings, in a chuckling tone. "See here!" and lie took out a heavy purse and threw it upon table. "If that is good money," said Brown, as- he took it up and weighed it for a moment in his hand, " you have twice as much as we, and we thought we had done well." "Good! ' laughed Billings; " you do n't suppose I would be such a fool as to change bad for worse. Look at it yourself; and for every spurious coin you find, I will promise you two next time I trade." A small phial was procured from the same box, and every piece as it was taken out tested. All, however, proved good; and when. the whole contents of the purses were poured to- gether, the gold and the bills formed a tempting pile any miser might envy. The sun had now set, and gray twilight was stealing into the room, wrapping in her mantle of sober hue the shining gold upon the table, and the thick spider's web that hung pen- dant from so many parts of the wall; hiding the marked and eager visages of the three men from one another's scrutinizing gaze, and giving especially to Billings the first feeling of se- curity he had had since he entered the room. In spite of all his efforts to control his countenance, he found himself, to his   CHRESTNUT WOOD.        321 unutterable dismay, sometimes breaking out into a savage smile, and then, becoming conscious of it, he felt the blood flow sud- denly from his face back to his heart, and his voice become husky, and his knees smite together so audibly to himself, that he felt sure Brown must hear them too. Suddenly he caught Brown's eyes fastened upon him, as if he was reading his soul. t Rising quickly, he asked fbr liquor, anything, no matter what, to drink. Brown, without a remark, handed him the bottle of brandy. Billings raised it to his lips, and attempted to swallow, but his parched throat refused, and with a gurgling sound, like that of a choking person, he put down the bottle. 6 It is too strong," he said. ' I must go for wine. I will be back in a few moments." [ "Yes, no doubt it is too strong," said Brown, in a peculiar tone. '- Very well, go now if you must, but hurry back; we have much business to do, and we must all be away from here before the day breaks, for I have heard a rumor that the police are about to search this spot, to find the ghost which frightens the foolish people of this street." As he said this he leaned forward and looked closely in Billings's face. Dark as it was, he could just discover that he rapidly changed color, and as soon as he left the room, and he hlard his step upon the stairs, he exclaimed: - "Harris, we are sold! That fellow has assured himself that we are here, and the gold too, and has gone to give notice to the police, that they may fairly trap us in our nest. It is the l first time he has not withheld more than half of his booty, and now he will cunningly make an arrangement by which he can have the reward and what good money they find here too. I thought I should catch him when I promised him his pay. You see I know my man. I have had reason to suspect him long, and I knew he could not withstand the promise of that last large reward. Have you noticed him this afternoon?"  &#xD;<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC7089-00000162"/> 322        CHESTNUT WOOD. "Yes, and I felt sure something was wrong, though what, 1 could not even guess." "Away with the money," said Brown, starting up. "Secrete- as much as you can upon your person. If we must die, we will sell ourselves like men." c; What can we do? If we attempt to go down through the store, we shall certainly meet them; and to venture out upon this m-iserable old roof were to put ourselves in the way of cer- tain death. Brown, I -say, we are fairly caught." "d It's a tame bird that is so easily snared. But I see only one thing left for us to do. If Billings will play the traitor, let him meet the traitor's doom." "How?" asked Harris eagerly. "It would comfort me much, if we must die, to just take him along with us. Vil. lain, traitor, death is only too good for him!" '"Then take that small saw, I will take this. Between the head of the stairs and our door there is, you know, but one long, narrow entry, with no other entrance to it but that by the stairs. Directly under this entry, and open through all the other stories of the house, down into the cellar, is a large open- ing, made to hoist and let down goods. The doors have not been closed over them these many years, so that these boards here removed, there will be nothing to prevent his landing upon the stones in the cellar. Broken bones he will get, if no- thing else." "Capital, capital," said Harris, rubbing his hands togethelr as if impatient to begin the work. "Saw these boards through! up here, all but a little place in the middle, just large enougll to hold them together until he is over the centre of the hole, his weight then will make them give way, and those that fol- low must wait our pleasure for getting to us, or despatch one of their number for planks to lay across, in order to reach us; and a bold man must he be who will cross a plank, with us at   I             CHESTNUT WOOD.         323 one end. .If they get tired of their game and leave us, why, then we will take our time and go when we get ready." "Exactly so," said Brown, as they both went quickly, but with a cautious movement of the saw, to work; and with Bil- lings gone, and one of their number sent, if they please, to the police office for more help to take us, we two shall be good'     odds against those that may remain; and we will put that small .   ladder across, and walk off with our gold and silver, leaving our bills to pay them for the trouble they have taken." Thele was an expression of savage mirth upon the counte- narices of the two as they completed the work of death, and bolting their door again, stood awaiting Billings's return. "If, after all," said Harris, in a hoarse whisper, " he should  not be guilty, it would not be quite fair to serve him so, would it, Brown?" "That we can easily tell," answered Brown, calmly. "Un- lock the door and keep it a little open, put your ear to the Icrack, and you can soon know whether there are one or more entering, They will not move very softly until they reach the second story. - If he is alone, we can easily stop him in time, and he will learn a lesson which he will not soon forget." They had waited but a few moments, when the noise of some one entering the building below was distinctly heard. "Is he alone?" asked Brown, quickly. "i think not; but listen for yourself." "No, there are at least four others with him." "Five to two. It was well planned. It is the sharpest j thing Billings ever did. It is well to die gloriously." Another grim smile passed over both of their faces. In the second story the steps seemed to pause, but in a mo- ment they heard them, only much more softly than before. "Close the door and let them come," said Brown. The door was instantly and very softly closed, but it was no  &#xD;<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC7089-00000163"/> 324        CRESTNUT WOOD, sooner done Lhan the knocking commenced as before, and they heard Billings ascend to meet his doom. There was another pause at the head of the stairs, then a step firmly and boldly forward, another, then a crash, a scream of mortal terror, and they heard the body of Billings as it 'knocked against the sides of the door, until with a shriek which rang through and through the building, he reached and lay crushed upon the cellar floor. The sides of a dark lantern seemed to have been instantly withdrawn with the first scream, for now a light streamed in through the cracks of the door, and fell upon the faces of the two men. They were both pale and haggard. For the first time, with all their other crimes, the actual sin of murder had fallen upon them; and in an instant, by the faint glimmer of that shaded lantern, seen only through the small crack of the door, they saw upon each other's forehead, as clearly as if in the broad light of noon, the mark of Cain. "It is his own fault," said Brown at last, and his voice seemed so changed that it startled them both, even then. "So perish all traitors. -Mean dog, he -has met the death lie de- served." Harris did not answer, but Brown saw him shudder. In the mean time those who were upon the stairs seemed to have recovered from their surprise, and to be satisfying them- selves as to what had taken place. "The villains," said a rough voice, LL have been expecting us. These boards have been newly sawed. That was an aw- . ful fall. Down with you, two of you, and see if the poor man is still alive. I think the first time he struck must have killed him. Listen-is not that a groan." A deep groan echoed up again from the spot to which it would seem he must have fallen, and losing no more time, two men hastened down.

Take up that ladder, and as I open the door, throw it firmly over on the other side. I will go first, you follow close." It was but the work of a moment. Before the men who were standing on the stairs could recover from their surprise, they found themselves suddenly face to face with the very per- sons they had come to seek. The one who stood lowest upon the stairs turned, and with two bounds cleared them, and without even looking behind him, made all haste to reach the street; but the foremost, who seemed to be the leader of the band, stood firm, and presenting his loaded pistol, bade them " pass at their peril." Brown knocked the pistol up, and sprang unharmed away; but just as he reached the lower floor, he heard it fired, then a heavy fall followed, and without waiting another instant to as- certain the fate of his companion, he darted away, and the curse went with him. VOL. It.       28  &#xD;<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC7089-00000164"/> CHAPTER   XVII. THREE years now passed without producing any very great changes upon the different characters of our tale. The sudden and awful death of Billings, and the crime of murder, which had sent Brown -a wanderer for the remainder of his life upon " the face of the earth," haunted forever by the echoes of that dying groan through the empty and desolate building, and fearing to return to the land which bore so many proofs of his guilt, brought, as everything must, good out of much evil. Sybil Thornton had received the letter forwarded to her by Billings, and being now so far removed that she could not ren- der any pecuniary aid to her father, had revealed to 'Mr. Ath- erton all her intercourse with him, and the plot so skilfully laid by which Billings still hoped to force her into marriage. Mr. Atherton's surprise and anger knew no bounds. At one time he chid Sybil severely for the risk she had run, and the unpleasant circumstances to which she had exposed herself; then again he would break out into expressions very unusual to him, of warm admiration for the heroic courage and the filial love which she had shown. It was with difficulty Sybil restrained him from returning to America at once, and searching out and punishing such '" un- paralleled impudence " as it deserved; and it is most probable   CHESTNUT WOOD.         327 all her entreaties would have been in vain, had it not been for fear of the disgrace which the whole exposure of the facts in the case would bring upon Sybil and himself. He decided, after much anxious thought, that it would be best for them to remain as long abroad as they could by any means content themselves, and then if Billings dared, which he very much doubted, to seek them there, why, he could take the law into his own hands, and should do as he pleased. As the first, and the second, and now nearly the third year had passed, and nothing had reached them again from Billings, both Mr. Atherton and Sybil began to hope that his career had met the end it so long deserved, and that they might re- turn home now in safety. Mr. Atherton longed for home with that intense desire which nothing but his stronger love for Sybil had enabled him to re- sist. Aunt Mary thought much of America, but after all her home was where her heart was, and her heart was satisfied with the love of the young, fair girl, so constantly beside her. Sybil loved Chestnut Wood as she did no other place on earth; but alas! the sunshine lingered no longer there. This she did not confess, even to herself; she only knew that she was happiest where she was; one can bear so such better to' know than actually to see a change they dread. By degrees, as time passed on and she ceased to be annoyed by either her father or. Billings, the memory of all those troubles faded away, and nothing seemed real, nothing permanent, but the one great heart sorrow - the lost. love, the affection that had grown. up between Mattie and Charles., It was the only part of Billings's letter to her which could never be forgotten-; and as she could not mention it to Aunt Mary, she had no means of satisfying herself with regard to its truth. Aunt Mary's correspondence with Hymeswold had not been so frequent as might have been expected.  &#xD;<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC7089-00000165"/> 828         CIESTNUT WOOD. Mrs. Rogers never wrote; the want of an early education made her ashamed to use her pen unless compelled. Mr. Rog- ers had become nearly as incrusted as his inkstand. His ser- mons did not often require revision; but occasionally he felt necessitated to add a few lines to Mattie's letters; and these efforts of Mattie became gradually less and less frequent, as other interests occupied her, until at last a letter, a home letter from America, was rather a rare circumstance. The correspondence between Sybil and Mattie also died away; and Charles Wallace's letters, though frequent, seemed written more for the purpose of eliciting an answer, than for giving any information respecting himself. So stood matters at the time Mr. Atherton determined to re- turn home; and the letter announcing this to Jerry, produced no small sensation in the little village of Hymeswold. Jerry had gone on managing the affairs at Chestnut 'Wood with just as much discretion and energy, for three -years, as he would have done for three months. Mr. Atherton's systematic method of doing everything, even to making arrangements for drought or deluge, had much facil- itated his work; and he had even taken writing lessons, until he could send his own account of his proceedings to Mr. Ath- erton, without what he called the interference of a third per-- son. He always liked head-quarters, and head-quarters always liked a straight story; once he liked to have caught it, by ask- ing Miiss Palmy to write fobr him; but that once was enough;, no one but a natural fool need learn the same lesson overT twice. Mrs. Giles had grown both fleshy and indolent in her easy position; but now, bestirred herself with something like the en- ergy of former years, to make ready for the coming of the family. Maggy, it was so undeniable a fact, that even Mrs. Giles could not gainsay it, had become almost American. She asso-   CHESTNUT WOOD.         329 ciated with none of her own country people, and was fast los- ing all that belonged peculiarly to them; all but their kind feelings, good! heart, and ready, never ceasing good-nature. Her work of course was light; she had plenty of time to learn to sew neatly, and to read well; her hand-writing too, many a fairer hand need not have been ashamed to own; and left so much as they were alone together, and missing the family too, it was no wonder that, sometimes, good, thriving Mrs. Giles thought Jerry spent time in the kitchen talking with Maggy, which might have been more profitably employed in working on the farm. However, from his known favoritism with her master, she held Mr. Jerry Goldsmith somewhat in awe, and durst not so much as hint her displeasure to him, though she made ample amends sometimes, by finding fault with Maggy, --"just," as Maglagy would say when repeating the conversation to Jerry, "( to keep her hand in." It was not long before the note of preparation commencing at Chestnut Wood, was heard in the old negro's cottage by the borders of Pomp's pond. Dinah's prayer had certainly been heard and answered; for the hand of' age had pressed lightly upon her during the three past years; and without one additional wrinkle or one added infirmity, she still sat in her old arm-chair, still passed her fin- gers over those holy words more precious than " apples of gold in pictures of silver;" yet dreamed, waking and sleeping, of' the heavenly home; and waited, as in her gentle, lively piety she often said, "but for the return of the bright angel, who should open one of the great gates of pearl that she might enter." "She is coming! she is coming!" Her ear was not so dull of hearing but she quickly caught the sound; and with clasped hands, and tears streaming over her- furrowed cheeks, she exclaimed:- 28* ;            *  .

"' Bless the Lord, O, my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name; "(Who satisfiest thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.' "Thy youth, thy youth is renewed," she repeated over and over again--"Dear little missis! Bless the Lord, bless the Lord, old nigger see her once again; bless the Lord, bless the Lord!" The joy with which the intelligence of the return of the family was received at the parsonage, was quite as sincere, and per- haps equally demonstrative. The want of the pecuniary aid whici' Mr. Atherton and Miss Rogers had rendered them was beginning to be severely felt, particularly by Mattie, whose fondness for, and inducements to, dress, had rapidly increased with her years. The old dresses had been for some time pronounced unfit to wear, and yet no way appeared of providing new ones. But setting aside all mere selfish reasons, every one at the parson- age was delighted with the prospect of reunion with those they so dearly loved; nor must Mattie be blamed if there mingled with her joy a desire to make known to Aunt Mary and Sybil, the happy end of what Aunt Mary had so coldly called " her youthful folly." But one heart, among those they had loved and left belind them, refused to welcome their return; and that was the heart of Charles Wallace. He had graduated, and chosen the profession of the ministry; for the boy's trials of feeling, and the disappointment of the young man's heart, had so effectually weaned him from his dreams of' worldly ambition, that he had no desire to gain the earthly crown, which in his childish dreams he had so longingly coveted. Even then, he had said, that "; Fame would not be fame, if it came to a lonely heart ;" and he saw no reason now, to think differently.   CHESTNUT WOOD.          331 The life of a minister; there was less of earth and more of heaven in its round of. daily duties; and strong, in -Charles's mind, grew the conviction that this life was but one scene in an eternity, the first act of the drama, whose final issue depends upon the adjustment of the character to its capabilities and wants; and thus, in giving him the true view of life, affliction was early blest to him; and with a manly, earnest, Christian heart, he set himself to work, not as' a slothful servant in the vineyard of his Master, but as a true, loyal one, who will return ten, for every one talent lent. Since his first visit to the parsonage 'at Hymeswold, he had been frequently there; and feeling that Sybil was lost to him forever, - not so much from the machinations of Billings as from  the pride of her heart, which would, he felt sure, never consent to stilly its purity by making known to him the crimes of her own father; and without this confidence no true sympathy could ever exist, at least, none that she would deem worthy of the name, - he allowed himself to become in- terested in all that concerned Mattie, and for her ardent, deep love, to return to her all he had to give - the affection of a brother's heart, who had never known what it was before to have a sister to love. It was no wonder, that dealing honestly and unsparingly with himself as he often did, he should mistake the one for the other; and attribute the calm and quiet beatings of his heart, so unlike the wild dream of his young first love, to the change which had tempered his whole character. It was not more strange that Mattie's voice and step should reach and find him unmoved, than that all those airy visions of the great, the world-renowned man, should have faded away; and his most earnest desire be to save only one 'soul as the crowning joy of his earthly ministry. Now, however, was to be applied, the test; and he felt and shrank from it,-and blushed to -find how .weak he was!  &#xD;<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC7089-00000167"/> 332        CHESTNUT WOOD. A few days before the vessel was expected, it reached lew York; and with very little delay in the city, Mr. Atherton and his family left for Chestnut Wood. Jerry had been endeavoring for some days to prepare a wel- come, which should seem fitting to express the joy of the occa- sion. Now, he determined to have the sexton ring the bell of' the church of Hymeswold as the carriage passed; and then, he remembered that Mr. Atherton was not a church goer, and per- haps would not like to be so loudly reminded of it; and then again, he would propose to collect whatever could be found to blaze easily and lightly, and have bonfires kindled all over the place. Perhaps "that might .frighten the horses or Miss Rlogers," suggested Mrs. Giles; and so, after many fruitless efforts, he at last decided to stand with Nep at the gate, take off his hat, and give three cheers, leaving it to Nep to choose for himself, his own fway of welcoming. And Jerry did the wisest thing he could to please a master who cared neither for bell-ringing or bonfire blazing, but much for the attachment of old and tried friends. Mr. Atherton wished to be spared all scenes ; and remem- bering the time when at Sybil's return, after her having been stolen, and. the demonstrations which were then made at the parsonage, he ordered the carriage to go to Chestnut Wood another way; and so the family looked and wearied themselves with watching, until the night hid the road from view. The first notice they had, of the arrival was a call early the next morning firom Aunt Mary; and her welcome was 1not a little shaded by the disappointment they felt in having missed the coming of' the night before. Aunt Mary looked with surprise and pleasure upon 5Iattie; one glance. was sufficient to tell her, not only how much she had altered, but also, how much she had improved.' v Her very tones of voice had caught a gentler sound, and the   CHESTNUT WOOD.         333 rich dark eye flashed and -faded, as it told the quickly changing emotions of the heart. Aunt Mary looked at her with both pride and pleasure; after all, she must have wronged the girl, for she had never dreamed she could develop into such a woman. Miss Rogers had not calculated the effect of a pure, happy love in ennobling and exalting a character; she had trembled over the fear of unrestrained passions; but she forgot that fre- quently those who are in the most danger from the one, are the most happily influenced by the other. As yet, she knew nothing of her niece's connection with Charles Wallace; and if she had, would hardly have ascribed the change to that source, Mattie must of course return with her to Chestnut Wood; Sybil had been quite sick on her passage over, and was not even now sufficiently restored to bear the least fatigue that could be avoided. She had not seemed well of late; both Mr. Atherton and herself hoped much for her from her return home, after she should be a little more rested. Such iwas Aunt AMary's account at the parsonage, of what had cost her many anxious thoughts. Sybil expressed very little pleasure at the prospect of re- turning home; and as the distance between them and their native land lessened, she lost her spirits and grew pale and thin.         ' "It might- be the sea air?" so Miss Rogers said; but she feared that sad face never belonged to any other than hearty sickness. Before her grandfather, Sybil exerted herself and tried to seem happy; and for once, she partially succeeded; but when within sight of Chestnut Wood, there was no need of seeming happy, for her heart leaped with joy as it had not for many a weary month before. And there was Jerry, who entirely for- got at the sight of her, his three cheers; and Nep, around  &#xD;<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC7089-00000168"/> :e34        CHESTNUT WOOD, whose neck she threw her arms as lovingly as when she was a child, and AMaggy, who wept and laughed by turns, and at last threw herself upon the ground at Sybil's feet, and clasping both her hands within hers, Idssed them with true Irish vehemence and affection. Old Mrs. Giles, really grown old in her indolent life, stood courtesying and smiling, while a beam of sunlight from the young heart of Sybil stole warmly into hers, to check for a time the gathering frosts of age. Blessings on the young! for they live two lives;' one in their own glad beings, and another in quickening the motion of the pulse grown tardy in its beatings, and sending the life- blood, with the quick, joyous pulsation of youth, up from the heart whose motions are already beginning to- grow slow and labored, like those of a wheel about to be broken at the cistern. Home was home, after all; and Aunt Mary's motherly heart responded with joy to the true pleasure that spoke from Sybil's voice and glowed from her deep blue eye. She was disappointed, therefore, on the next morning, to meet the sad face again; and was prepared for the refusal to accompany her to Hymeswold, which her half proposed invita- tion drew forth. "Bring Mattie here," said Sybil; "I am weary and almost sick this morning, and I know she will not refuse to come." They had not met for nearly four years; and during that time, neither had been warned of the change that had talkcJ place in the other, and as they stood now face to face, the feel- ing of being strangers crept over them, and that first look sep- arated them farther than had the parting of years. Aunt Mary watched them narrowly, and her quick eye re td the story at one glance. If they ever loved as they had loved, they must begin to do so over again, and in a very different way. It was almost painful to see the same beingsrwho had for   CHESTNUT WOOD.         335 so many years lived in 4 closer bond than even sisters, now so cold and constrained, with not one warm gushing feeling of welcome at their hearts, and only the formal courtesy of strang- ers upon their lips. Aunt Mary turned away. There was something in the sight which struck a chill through her heart, a foreboding of evil to those she loved. Mattie proposed a visit to Dinah, but Sybil was not well enough, and then, she wished her first interview with the old negro should be alone. She looked forward to it with eager pleasure, but not today. Rest for the body, rest for the mind; Sybil needed both more than any one but herself could know. Mattie was not urged to stay at Chestnut Wood. Aunt Mary had hoped to detain her, particularly after- seeing the improvement which had taken place; but there was no earnest cordiality in Sybil's polite invitation, and for the first time in her life, as Mattie returned home, she felt that she had parted from the mistress of Chestnut Wood. But Sybil' was welcome to it. She had a treasure with which she would not part fbr all the riches of Cresus, and in comparison with which the splendid house and lordly domain of the young heiress shrunk into insignificance. The knowledge of this priceless wealth was all her own. To no one save her. own parents had it ever been imparted; but now Aunt 3aary must soon know it, and Sybil too. What would Sybil -say? How beautiful she was. What would Charles Wallace think of her now. When they were children years, yes, long years ago, she had fancied that Sybil and Charles would one day really love one another, and be be- trothed. How could she have been so strangely mistaken, and what a sad world it would have been to her, had such an event taken place. Mattie did not like to think of it; it made her uncomfortable, almost unhappy, and she wished Charles  &#xD;<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC7089-00000169"/> 336         CH'ESTSUT WOOD. ,would come to assure her the whole was but a creation of her fancy. She was glad when she reached home, glad when she heard her mother's voice, glad when she could go to her own room, and unlocking her drawer, read over and over again every living word he had ever written her. Strange, that never before the letters had struck her as rath- er cold and formal, as unlike the tenderness of hers. She dropped upon them tears, actual tears, then seeing the blot they made, started with an hysterical laugh, and put them all away again; but before she went to sleep that night, she wrote a long letter to Charles. She did not tell him how she felt, but she told him how dearly she loved him, how entirely her whole future happiness was in his-keeping. CWhen Charles received this letter he also received -a short note from Mr. Atherton, announcing his return, and requesting to see him for a few days at Chestnut Wood. He glanced carelessly over Mattie's letter. Poor Mattie! the same letter that had flowed so spontaneously from an over- burdened heart; and then waged a conflict fiercer and stronger with himself than he had ever done before. How was it that he, a man and a Christian, with his love plighted to another, dared to fear the meeting with one who had thrown away the warmest, freshest affections of his heart, as worthless things; who had weighed pride against love, and withlout a regret, which would have been at least womanly, had given the verdict so unhesitatingly and unalterably to pride. A cold, dead heart, hers must be, and yet he trembled and shrank from meeting her, as if' he, instead of she, were the guilty one. "I will go," he said at last, with a fierce energy. "She shall see, that though she rejected, she did not crush me. I will stand before her now, as I am, in the pride of my manhood,   CIIESTNUT WOOD.          337 and she shall :know that I am still a man, that hope, and jojy, and life did not die with her." "Hope, and joy, and life!" "Hope! Hope of what now?" asked the man. "Eternal life," answered the Christian. "Joy! what can you know of joy? asked the man again. "The joy of doing good," again answered the Christian. "Life! life! what of such a life?" "A life wher'e they neither marry or are given in marriage," promptly responded the Christian; and the murmurs of the heart were stilled. Oh1 Mattie, Mattie! the long looked for answer to your let- ter has come at last, but it brings more of the Christian than of the lover, more of the sentiments of a strong, upright man, who will die rather than swerve from the known path of duty, than of him who looks to brighten his life with the sunshine of a loved heart. The letter told of his intention of being in a few days at Hymeswold, and also of spending a short time, in compliance with Mr. Atherton's invitation, at Chestnut Wood. But Mat- tie knew that she could trust him, and she commanded down every rising feeling of fear or distrust. Was he not entirely her own, her plighted lover? and should they not both go to- gether, and be lappy once more there, as they were when they were children? But befbre he came, it was only fitting that her friends should be informed of the connection which existed between them;  and her mother was not at all unwilling to be deputed to perform the mission. She was, as she might well have been, proud of the engagement, and could hardly restrain herself from whispering the good news on the morning of Aunt Mary's first visit. Fortunately for Sybil, she had gone to see Old Dinah when Mrs. Rogers came to Chestnut Wood, and she received the in- telligence in Aunt Mary's most delicate manner. VOL.

"I supposed it was true," was her only remark; But Aunt Mary noted the deadly paleness upon her cheek, and sawl her press her hand upon her heart. "It gives me much pleasure on M3attie's account," said Aunlt Mary, turning her eyes away, so that Sybil should not- sup)os( she was watching her. "I think he has already"lad a most beneficial effect upon her character, and her mother assures me that she is very happy." "She must be very happy," said Sybil, absently. "And Charles," continued Aunt Mary, still withoLut noticing  Sybil, " is to be here in a few days, in compliance with an in- vitation firom your grandfather." ' I knew it," answered Sybil, so quietly, that Ault 'Mary could not but look up to see her. "And I am sure," said Aunt Mary, speaking unusually quick and loud, " that we shall all be glad to see him, we have been separated from him so many years. He has grown to be a very handsome man, my sister tells me; and what is better than all, intends to become a minister. I am delighted that he has really chosen that profession. a' When does he come?" asked Sybil in the same tone. "Day after to-morrow, so his last letter to Mattie said." Aunt Mary saw Sybil again press her hand to her heart. "He will not stay long, for he is too busy now to spare much time for visiting. So far as I can learn, he has not lbeen  often to Hymeswold of late."  Sybil showed no inclination to continue the conversation; and her intelligence given, Aunt Mary was not Uinwilling, to exchange the topic for one of a less painful nature.: Sybil must recount to her all that had taken place at Old Dinah's; and there was much in the touching nature of the in- terview which she loved to dwell upon. What would Sybil's  life have been without Aunt Mary? She could adapt herself' so well to every shade of feeling in her varied life. Now, she   CHlESTNUT .WOOD.    '    3' did not succeed, nor had she hoped to, in making hIer fobrget; but sihe softened the sharpness of her sorrow, by bringinL around it the gentle, heavenly influence of the old negro's sim- p'le piety. Charles arrived at the expected timne. Sybil heard Nep's loud bark of joy, heard her grandfather's cordial reception, and Aunt AMary's softer welcome before she could move to meet him. But he did not wait for her; seeing her  in the library he advanced, and withl one of his old smiles held out his hand to her as if' they had parted but yesterday. There was some- thing in his very composure which was, to Sybil, most exciting. Had he faltered but for a moment, had his voice trembled or one soft glance of regret beamed from his eye, she would have been as cold and stern as he was; but now she could not raise her eyes; she laid her hand, cold and deathke, in his, and when he dropped it, it fell to 'her side as if suddenly stricken with palsy.  Slhe in vain endeavored to speak, her parched lips refused to mnove, and with at convulsive effort she gasped for breath. "Sybil, are you sick?" he said; and his whole tone and manner instantly altered. "Yes; I  am sick, foolish, like a child," answered Sybil, sud- denly regaininig her power of speech. "Aunt Mary, will you open the window?  I believe I am faint." "Your walk this morning was too much," said Aunt, Mary, quietly rising to open the window.  "She has not been well since our return, and every little thing seems to overcome her." But it was over now;  Sybil was not used to having her feel- ings the master, and after a few moments of painful silence to all, she was the first to speak, and inquire in that sweet, low voice, every tone of which burned into Charles's soul, of his journey, of his occupations, arnd of his late college life. Sometimes, Charles answered her correctly, but much oftener with  ca wandering eye and thought; and at length Mr. Atnher-  &#xD;<pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC7089-00000171"/> ton, who had been by no means an unconcerned spectator, pro- posed to Charles to accompany him, to see the improvements and alterations which Jerry had made around the place during his absence. Mr. Atherton had heard of Charles's engagement to IMattie, but felt no inclination to blame the young man for what seemed to him so natural a result of their long intimacy; particularly as he had such good reasons for believing, that he had first sought Sybil's love, and it had been refused him. He had seen with much pain today the feeling which Sybil had evinced, and the thought that, perhaps after all, she loved Charles, forced itself often upon him during that 'Walk. But who shall tell the tumult of feeling which it awakened in the breast of the young man himself. A man and a Christian, he had thought he was, but he now found he was a little child, and the whole fabric of his faith seemed to quiver "( like a reed shaken by the wind." Had he found Sybil as he left her years ago, he would have remained cold and stern, but now he dared not question what her emotion might mean. He tried to iwrap i around himself the mantle of a brother's love; but alas! hovow could it warm or cover a beating heart!  He must not stay at Chestnut Wood; he could not remain at Hymeswold; and so, feeling like a- traitor, as if he had no longer a claim to be considered either the man or the Christian, he went home to pursue, as best he might, the studies of his profession. --'is mother had many inquiries to make, but he had no an- swer for them; and once more the mothers eye looked deep into the son's heart, and read the secret hidden from every other. She had been pleased with his engagement to Mattie; that is, pleased if he could not make Sybil his wife, that lie should marry whomever he felt most attached to; and as years had slipped by, she had begun to look forward with some impatience to the time when he should really bring a daughter to her hlouse.   CHEISTa'NUT WOOD.        341 She should not hear " Mamma Wallace" from that soft ring- ing voice she loved so dearly; but no mother who is proud of her son, can quite forgive an injury which he has received; and she had not even now forgotten how he had suffered when first he learned that the love of the young heiress was not for him. Mattie had been often to visit her; and there was something in her frank, confiding, generous nature akin to her own; be- sides, she dearly loved her son; and that alone, if it had been required, would have covered "a multitude of sins." She had settled down quietly into the conviction that all things had been for the best; and that in the end, the present arrangement would probably be conducive to the most happi- ness; when suddenly, like a bolt from heaven, the conviction that there could result nothing but misery from the connection, broke upon her. Charles's altered and haggard appearance, his nights sleep- less, she knew, - for she heard his step up and down, down and up his little chamber long after the midnight hour, -- and - his days, when his books were neglected or lay idly scanned upon the table before him, all these things told a tale which she could not but read if she would. With characteristic energy, she 'sat herself at work to go back over the years since she had known Sybil; and to call up every little circumstance, in order to determine more correctly the beings which could have influenced her in her rejection of Charles. Her heart had never been satisfied with the reason by which she had endeavored to quiet it; she knew that Sybil Thornton had that kind of pride that would have valued wealth and station, only as it gave her the power of conferring lappi- ness on those she loved; and therefore, that it was not as the heiress of Chestnut Wood that she refused the love of the farm- er's son; there must be something, some weightier reason; and at last, from out of the darkness, there began to dawn a faint ray of light. &#xD;<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC7089-00000172"/> $,1 -d      'nL:S!I ,:,TN U'UT  WOOD. When her husband had found Sybil oi the road, and brought her in his market-cart home a(gain to her, to nurse and strength- cn, the child had for some days showed an inclination to wander in her mind. She liad talked strangely; and though at that time she had attributed it to weakness and overlstrained nerves, yet, was it not possible that she had inherited a tendency to in- sanity; and in one, of these fits had wandered .xaway, and re- mained lost until found by Mr. Wallace? and if such a thing would happen to ler when a child, might it not recur again; i:: and was it not probable, after all, that for much that seemed to others strange, she was not accountable? There was almost joy in the sad thought to Mrs. Wallace; for anything was better to her than ingratitude or fickleness; and she could not but attribute both to Sybil, as her conduct had appeared before. Full of the wisdom of her solution, she suggested the proba- bility of such a thing to Charles, and was not a little annoyed by the entire denial which it met. "You are wholly mistaklen, mother," he said; " o living per- son is further, from any such thing. Sybil Thornton knows what, and why sle did what she decided upon; and long as I have known her, I have never seen her strprised into an action she seemed ever after to regret. - The answer was decisive; Mrs. Wallace had certainly that time failed to give the comfort she had intended; and, though not herself convinced, she came to the conclusion that the world had changed very much since she was a young girl, and, that if people had grown wiser, they were not half so happy or easy to live with. She had certainly made no such trouble when she was in love with her husband, and she did not believe many happier couples could be found now, than they were, and alwrays had been. She did not understand the ways how-a-days, and Sybil, and Mattie; and Charles must work out their own happi- ness, for all that she could dlo to help them. So sle concluded.   CTIESjTNUT WOOD.       413 and if Charles had been away from her, so that she would not have been constantly reminded of his trouble by his sad face, she would probably have carried her resolution into effect, and left themn to themselves; but with her son always before her, slie found it quite a different matter. Life moved but tardily forward now with the young people. Sybil occupied herself at home, very much in- the same way she had done abroad; and after all, there is nothing like a round of daily occupation, honestly and faithfully attended to, to calm and quiet a disturbed mind. She rode upon Rose, who had lost much of the fire and life of youth, but was. the more. sedate and manageable, and suited to the gentle state of Sybil's mind; anything to combat with, would have wearied, as much as quiet comforted her. Rose seemed to recognize her young mistress's return with scarcely less pleasure, than her other friends; and, what was better, adapted herself so kindly to her changed mood. Perhaps she was conscious what made the rein hang so listless- ly upon her neck. There is much of sympathy with us in dumb beasts, which we can hardly appreciate if we are not very observant of their modes of expressing feeling. The instinct of the brute creation is nearer akin to our reason than we are willing to allow; though many might be shamed by the proofs of affection and remembrance which they are not capable of ex- hibiting. oWe are slow -to be taught a lesson for good, by a thing we think beneath us; and yet we are told to cull them even from the humble lillies of the field. "Sybil will never. die of a broken heart," said Mr. Atherton to himself, with a glance of pride at the beautiful girl. "She loves Charles Wallace, and yet see how she bears up against it, like a queen. It would have crushed her mother, but she will rise above it soon." "Yes, Sybil will rise above it soon," was Aunt Mary's com- fort. "She is so noble, so generous, that she will be happy in seeing Charles and Mattie lappy.

THiER:E was one event which took place about this time which really added much to Sybil's serenity and happiness. On one of her visits to Old Dinah, as soon as she entered the door, Dinah, without waiting to give her even her customary blessing, pointed to the brass candlestick, and said: "Under there; under there, look, little Missis; I have clean forgot to tell you before." A shudder passed over Sybil as she obeyed her injunction. Her associations withl that candlestick were so painful, that she had been inclined several times to ask Dinallh to let her re- move it from her silght, but knew the strength of the old ne- gro's attachment to every little thing, around her, and Sybil could not be selfish. So many years had elapsed without any intelligence, either of her father or Billings, that she began to hope she should be freed for the future from annoyance; but still, a secret fear that at some unexpected moment they milght return, and she be again subjected to all she had been, had perhaps reconciled her more to Charles's love beingr transferred to another, than anything else. "Why should I wish," she said often to herself, " to involve him in the trouble and shame which must ever cling to me. No, no; it were worse than selfish; and if he knew all, how lie   CHESTNUT WOOD.         345 would despise me. That I can, even in my secret thoughts, repine that he must love another. Sybil, Sybil Thornton, it is unworthy of you." Poor Sybil! She could thus chide herself, but she could not still the murmurs of a longing heart; she could not si- lence the yearnings for the love of him she loved. "Under the candlestick; look, look, little Missis," repeated Dinalh, as she saw the wavering way in which Sybil approached the shelf. "It lhas waited for you a long time." Sybil no longer hesitated. She found a crushed and crum- bled paper, and unfolding it, she, read thus: "Sybil Thornton, you are free. If I durst I would call upon God to witness, that never again, by word or letter, shall you hear from your miserable father. I shall expiate my sins. God will visit the punishment upon me, and not upon my child. It has begun already, that worm that never dies. Billings, no, Langdon you call him, lies there, crushed, dead! I heard him - groan, Sybil Thornton! I tell you lie is dead! Do you hear me? he is dead, and I am a wanderer on the face of the earth. Have no fear, you have now no father. Be happy, fobr he is gone." As Sybil read the last word, she lost all consciousness. Her physicqal nature liad become more enfeebled than even she had been aware of; and this stroke, coming so suddenly as it had, 1had proved too much for her. When she recovered, she was back at Chestnut Wood, lying in her own chamber, the cur- tains dropped over the windows, and Aunt MAlry sitting beside h1er. - "What does it all mean?" she said, attempting to start up in her bed. But Aunt Mary gently fotcecd her back. "You have been quite sick, my darling," she said, soothing- ly. "Lie still and keep quiet." "Where is it! what has become of it?:" exclaimed Sybil, starting unp again, and looking wildly around her.  &#xD;<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC7089-00000174"/> 83t6        CIIESTNUT WOOD. "Is it this you want?" asked Aunt Mary, taking from her pocket the soiled paper. "Yes, give it to me. Have you read it?" and Sybil fixed her eye upon Aunt Mary as if to read her soul. "Not one line. I found it by you on the floor at Dinah's I cottage, and put it away." "Ask my grandfather to come to me," said Sybil, much calmed by Aunt Mary's quiet manner. "Not now, Sybil, you are too weak." "I must see him, Aunt Mary, without any delay; I am well and strong now. What happened; how came I here? "( You were gone unusually long from home, and I started to find you. And first I went to Dinah's cottage. You were ly- ing on the floor where you had fallen, she had seated herself by your side, drawn your head into her lap, and was repeat- ing verses, and praying over you. I could not make her give me any distinct idea of what had happened, but she pointed to the note, then to you, and then uttered such touching pray- ers, that you might wait to open the I great pearl gates for her,' as I never heard before. I waited by you until you were par- tially restored, and then in the deep sleep which followed, you were removed, almost without your knowledge, home." In giving Sybil this short but clear account of what had taken place, Aunt Mary showed her tact in taking care of the sick; for she had now left nothing for her to imagine, and her mind could rest 3 -she also soon saw, that it would be better for her to colmmunicate whatever she wished to her grandfather, and accordingly sent for him.       / He had but just left the room, in compliance with Aunt AMary's urgent request, as Sybil gave signs of awakening, and now quickly returned. An event of so uncommon a nature as Sybil's fainting, had filled him with anxiety and alarm, Could it be possible, after all, that her heart was not too proud to break."   CHE STKUT WOOD.        'r He tcas, therefbre, very much relieved to see the evidence of some other cause of emotion in the note which she unhllesi- tatingly gave him. It was the last, then, of the husband of his idolized Mary, the father of Sybil, and his own long prized and much valued adopted son. "It is the end, Sybil," he said. '6May God have mercy on his soul." It was the first time fbr years Mr. Atherton had called upon, the name of God; and now the ejaculation came from his heart. Suddenly, as if a weight had been lifted, all the sufferings and grief the wretched man had caused seemed light in compari- son to what now remained of the curse to himself. From  his letter Mr. Atherton did not doubt that he had finally committed the crime of murder; and the stern, proud na- ture of the man stood trembling and awe struck in the presence of Him who had made Himself the avenger. The conscious- ness of his own weak efforts, the many futile attempts which lihe had made to control and baffle fate, the blind and success- less measures by which he had hoped to bring about this result, anad now, without his knowledge or cooperation, behold the man was a  murderer; cursed; a wanderer forever. Surely, there is a God, who directs and controls all; and as with the speed of lightning these thoughts passed through his mind, from- his lips broke the words, "May God have mercy on- his soul." God, the avenger, had at last reached the man who wasli turned away by his chastisements, nor won to love Him by the soft pleadings of earthly affection. The shock which Sybil had received, her naturally delicate constitution, and the long wear and tear to which her nervous system had been subjected, proved now more obstinately to op- pose her recovery than even her physician had anticipated. She was able to leave her room, and to be around the house, sometimes on very fine days to drive out for a short ride, but  &#xD;<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC7089-00000175"/> 3g18        CHESTNUT WOOD. her forIn grew every day thinner, her face paler, and her silver voice seemed to have acquired a thin, sharp tone, which told of debility and sadness. "There was nothing to be done for her," so the physician declared, so both Mr. Atherton's and Miss Rogers's judgment decided; and Sybil, after making many vain efforts to rally herself, began to have her thoughts turned much away from the things around her, to that other and better life, She knew she was young to die. She loved the green earth and the bright sly, the still coming on of the morning, and the soft and fading twilight. Each bright flower had a story of its owrn beauty, and her-ear listened eagerly to'the murmur of in- numerable living things. She loved her friends. She had much yet to live for, and no wish to die; but she felt day by day her hold on all these things grow feebler and feebler; she could enjoy them so much less; and even the enjoyment, slight as it was, became a source of fatigue, which she was soon obliged to deny herself. It was an undeniable fact, that Sybil Thornton, young, beau- tiful, gifted as she was, was marked for an early doom ; and dis- ease, if disease it might be called, strode on quickly to (do its work. A few months after the reception of her father's note, Sybil was unable to leave the house; and Aunt Mary for the lirst time communicated her apprehensions with regard to her at the parsonage. They were received with that dread silence which tells thez depth of feeling so much better than words. It was the first time the thought that Sybil Thornton could die had ever oc- curred to them. And now the intercourse between the parsonage and Cllest- nut Wood once more commenced. Mattie became necessary to the comfort of the invalid. As the silver chain was loosened, and the conviction grew strong   CHESTNUT WOOD.       .  349 within Sybil's heart that she must die, she resigned all earthly love more cheerfully; she could even bear to think that Charles and Mattie might live and be happy, together, when she should be forgotten.  Soothingly  and pleasantly came back to her wearied spirit the early affection that had gladdened her young life. Mattie and she had learned to love again, but they had -begun not where they parted, but where they first met. Seated close beside her throughout those long summer days, never wearied, anticipating every wish, beguiling every languid moment with the gaiety which never told how forced it was, - Mattie had but one wish, to save the life which grew dearer and dearer to her as it drew to its close.-' Years of discipline were compressed to that young girl in those few, quickly passing months. To stand by the side of one we love, and look into their opening grave! Oh! many and many a tear-bedimmed lesson we read there, which-we may never forget. Aunt Mary was glad to resign part of her charge to Mattie; she thought it better for Sybil to have some one more nearly 'her own age around her. She could do for her, and that too, with a smile, but it was hard when she felt as if her own heart was breaking; and Mr. Atherton, as Sybil became more and more unable to exert herself, and he too felt that she must go, began really to shun her - he could not see her die. Sybil asked that the portrait of her mother might be re- moved from the library, where her grandfather had allowed it to remain, and brought to her room. The request was instantly complied with; what could she ask that he would not grant? And it became a source of much comfort to her, as she lay upon her bed or reclined in her sick chair. "She felt," she often said, " as if she was becoming acquaint- ed with her mother, and should recognize her as soon as she met her in heaven;" and then, in the wild, wandering way so common to those, who die without ,any particular disease, she VOLw.

Sybil had but few friends away from Hymeswold, whom it was considered necessary to inform of her situation. Jerry went every day to see, and talk with old Dinah; partly because Sybil wished it; and partly because, as he said, " the only rest he had, the only time that he could feel as if it was not terrible wicked for God to take away such a good young thing as Sybil, when there were so many sinners who could be spared better than not, was when Dinah was praying." The old negro was the only one who could think of losing Sybil. "Blessed Saviour! blessed Jesus!" she would say, with clasped hands and streaming eyes, " take us both to that heav- enly home. Give us the golden harp, and the sparkling crown I How sweet to hear little missis sineg, Glory I glory! hallelu- jah!' Bless the Lord, bless the Lord! ' When I walk through, the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for Thou wilt be with me'--,Thou and little missis;; little missis and old Dinah, in the heavenly home, sin ' Glory! hallelujah!'" This was what Jerry called Dinah's praying; and no doubt it ascended to the mercy seat. Mattie, in her letters to Charles, kept nothing back; and Mrs. Wallace soon learned through him of Sybil's sickness. When she proposed to go to Ler in a few days, impatiently and almost angrily, he asked her, "ayWhy she need delay?" and hardly gave her time to make the necessary preparations, be- fore he hurried her to Chestnut Wood. She was an unexpected, but ftr from an unwelcome guest; and there was something in lher straiht-forward firank manner, 19   CtTESTNUT WOOD.         35  which was a relief to the sensitive and shrinking nature of Miss Rogers. She asked her questions respecting Sybil's sickness, which Aunt Mnrmy had. not dared ask even herself; and listened to the answer, as if upon it depended Sybil's fate. "Does she cough, Miss Rogers?" "Not at all; I think I have nesver once heard her.9 "Does she have night sweats?" "No; she sleeps quietly as a child." "Does she have chill or fever?" "Neither; she complains of nothing, and does not seem to suiffer. "Then, what is the matter with her?" "I do not know; no one, not even the physician can tell; she fails rapidly, and is surely going to die." "I never heard of a person's dying without being sick. I rather think you are quite as much alarmed about her as you have reason for being; but I can tell better when I see her." But even Mrs. Wallace's faith was staggered, when she ac- tually saw her. "My darling child," she said, as she pressed her to her warm motherly heart, " what is the matter with you?" "Dear Mamma Wallace!" and the mother missed from these first words the silver tone; "I am so glad to see you; I am so glad you have come; do take me, and let me lay my head upon you as I used to when I was a little child." "Rather a large baby I should have, dcarling ; but come, come; I am  strong enough to hold two such delicate children as you are."         , And the good woman would actually have taken Sybil in her arms as she used to years ago. Her very presence in the room  seemed to infuse new life and vigor into all. She spoke cheerfully, she lifted the window- curtains to let the bright sunlight chase away the gloom of the  &#xD;<pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC7089-00000177"/> 352        CHESTNUT WOOD. sick room; she raised the sashes, and the breath of summer air, from which Sybil had been so carefully excluded for fear of taking cold, stole gently in, and piayed among her long golden curls, and fanned her wan, feverish cheek, and brought to her the fragrance of the garden flowers, and in its soft whispers, told her, that she was yet an inmate of the beautiful earth. Aunt BMary did not interfere; she was relieved to have some one take the. responsibility for what her own agitated feelings had more than half unfitted her; and she remembered of old, that Mrs. Wallace was a nurse of' sound judgment and much experience. Therefore, on the next day when Mrs. Wallace said, in her decided manner - ' Sybil must go out; she is dying for want of air and exer- cise," no one opposed her; and she was lifted in Jerry's strong arms, and carried as gently down, as if she were a sick child. For a few days, it was astonishing to see how quickly Sybil rallied. Hope, that welcome inmate once more entered the house, and her presence was apparent in Mr. Atherton's re- newed cheerfulness and more frequent visits to Sybil's room; but the change for the better was soon past, and symptoms be- came apparent which took away the hope from even Mrs. Wallace. It however convinced her, that her suspicions with regard to the source of Sybil's sickness were well founded, and after many anxious and wearing hours of reflection, she decided what was the only th ing iremaining to be done. In pursuance of her determination, she sought the first opportunity for a long and fiee conversation with Mattie, and returned from it to Sybil's room with a gleam of pleasure in her eye, the influence of Which, all immediately felt. "Mattie Rogers is the finest girl I ever saw in my life," she said, - suddenly breaking -a long silence, during which she seemed to be very intently thinking. She is a noble, rener-   CHESTNUT WOOD.         353 ous, whole-souled girl, and I love her more and more, the better I know her." An expression of pain passed for an instant over Sybil's face, but she said immediately, with a generous smile:- "She is more than all that, mamma Wallace; she is as good and kind and affectionate, as she is noble and generous." "Now only hear that," said Mrs. Wallace, who had been not a little alarmed' as to the effect of her speech, after it was ut- tered. "Were there ever two girls so fonid of each other as these two? No one need tell me there is nothing good in this world; there is plenty of the very best kind; and I, for one, believe that it only those who have none in their own hearts, and do not recognize it when they find it, that are always talking about what a wicked world this is; for my part, people seem to me to be good, and do good, much oftener than any other way." For the next day, and the next, Mattie did not come  to Chestnut Wood.   Sybil said with a laugh, almost merry:- ("That she must have heard what had been said of her, and be afraid she should do something to forfeit Mamma Wallace's good opinion if she came."  And Jerry was sent to ascertain if she was sick. Word came back that though not sick, she was not well; but she would soon be at Chestnut Wood again. Just in the last glimmer of the summer twilight, Sybil heard her door softly open; she had been for some time alone, hav- ing persuaded Aunt Mary and Mrs. Wallace to go out, and en- joy the beauty of the evening. She was surprised to hear them so soon home again; but on turning, saw Mattie, who, putting her finger on her lips, moved softly up to her bed. "Hush, Sybil, do not calL  I do not wish any one to know I am here. I have come for but a moment. I have come 30*  &#xD;<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC7089-00000178"/> 354        CHESTNUT WOOD. because I cannot sleep, I cannot rest; because-because I have a suspicion, a dreadful suspicion," and Mattie shuddered;' "but it will kill me if I doubt any longer. Look at me; see how changed I am," and she placed herself between Sybil and the fading light. "Well, I should die soon, it would kill me, too, if I did not know, if I must doubt any longer; and you will answer me, and answer me truly, Sybil Thornton, I know you will, for you will pity me when you know how much I suffer." She bent over Sybil's pillow, and putting her lips close to Sybil's ear, whispered in a tone which Sybil never forgot - "Do you love him, Sybil?" Sybil did not answer. "Answer me, Sybil, answer me, or I shall go mad; do you love Charles Wallace?" A convulsive effort for breath was her only answer. "Have I killed you, Sybil; and you did love him, and I have done it. H--I might have known it. You always loved him. I remember it all now; when you were a little child, before you knew me, Sybil, you loved him. And lie, yes, I will say it," and Mattie's voice sank to that low, clear whisper again, "he loved you; he always loved you; though I do not blame him. I loved him, oh God! so wildly that he could not but think' he loved me too. But it is all over now, Sybil Thornton," and Mattie spoke aloud and very calmly. "I have written to him to say how blind, and foolish I have been, and to tell him how eagerly I have read over all his let- ters, and thought over all he ever said to me, and how con- vinced I am that he never loved me with any other than a brother's love. But I do not blame him or you. I only have been selfish and thoughtless; and I should have killed you, Syb- il, and never known it; but he would have known, and then only think of me! Oh Sybil, I thank God that the knowledge has not come too late! %  -'*   CIESTNUT WOOD.         355 She bent over Sybil, and kissed her fondly. Sybil's face was cold, like that of a dead person, and her breath came fit- fully, as if drawing to its close; but Mattie noted none of these things. Dropping on her cheeks burning tears, which she had not been conscious that she shed, she turned and left the room; and when Mrs. Wallace and Aunt Mary came back from their walk, no trace of her visit remained, but in the panting breath and throbbing heart of Sybil.. They supposed she had become suddenly sicker, and without questioning her, began to use restoratives , but all that night and death struggled hard for mastery, and when the morning dawned, in the panting and emaciated figure which lay upon the bed, no one would have recognized Sybil Thornton. Again, now in the morning twilight, a light touch was on the door, a light step entered, and a voice with a glad tone, which sounded like richest music through that room of death, said - "Sybil, dear Sybil, you must grow better know. We can- not have you sick any longer. I have brought you flowers, with the morning dew fresh upon them. Are they not full of promise of future beauty? They are still in the bud, but look, smell them, Sybil; before noon the bud shall be the fill blown rose; and think not that the othei buds, those that the same stem has borne, shall droop and die because this shall blossom first. To-morrow, or at most the next day, their time will also come. Look, Sybil, look! how beautiful they are." "Dear Mattie," said Sybil, in a faint, low tone, "' God will bless you for this." "And you will live and be happy yet, Sybil; I feel it, I know it; and we shallll I be happy together." The emphasis she laid upon the word all, revealed at once to Mrs. Wallace what had taken place. Withdrawing Aunt Mary from the room, she said:- t,  ,   &#xD;<pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC7089-00000179"/> 35b         CHESTNUT WOOD. "Let us leave them alone together; it is the best medicine Sybil can have." "And she was right. Sybil could say but little, but that little was sufficient; and when after an hour's absence Mrs. Wallace stole softly in, she found them sleeping on the same pillow, hand clasped in hand, as they used to rest when chil- dren. "It is all right," she said to herself. "Mattie is a noble girl; and if she can only manage to keep happy and not let Sybil see she mourns for her loss, Sybil will get well again; and Mattie is never the one to die of a broken heart. After all, let people say what they will, while such people as Mattie live, there will be good enough in the world to save the city at least."   CHAPTER XIX. IT is very tempting to linger over scenes like these; for, after all, like Mrs. Wallace, nothing interests and delights us more than to find how much good there is in the world. But our pages have already grown, we fear, beyond the patience of our readers, and we will now hurry to the close. Mattie was, as Mrs. Wallace had called lher, " a noble, gen- erous girl," or rather woman; for if years had not yet given her a claim to that title, the scenes of discipline through which she had passed certainly had. Her love for Charles Wallace was deep and strong, and under its genial influence while happy, the better and higher part of her nature had been fully de- veloped; and when the hour came that the sweet note in the melody of her life was to be hushed forever, the very growth of her better nature gave her the power to cover with smiles the loss; and excepting to the watchful, never to be deceived eyes of her parents, to go forth again into life gentler, better, and to wait patiently until again the stilled heart should waken at the call of another love. Sybil did recover, slowly and with difficulty. Mattie brougllht Charles to her bedside, and with a fieedoli which nothing but the sacrifice which she had made would liave rendered proper, insisted that they should love each other now as they always had before she parted them.  &#xD;<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC7089-00000180"/> 358        CHESTNUT WOOD. ' And you will love me, Sybil," said Charles, " fbr Mattie's sake, and because I know all that you have kept from me so long, and because I cannot live without you." Mattie put Sybil's hand in his. It was-cold and deathke, but it lay there ; she did not remove it; and slipping from the room, Mattie with the star fallen from her heaven, but the joy of a good and noble action resting with her, left the lovers to go back over the years that had passed, and forward, with beating, happy hearts to those to come. A wedding instead of a funeral! it was a change indeed. Mr. Atherton gladly resigned the cares of life, said " he had enough to do to rest in quiet enjoyment of the few years which were left," but with a smile, half stern and half joyful, remind- ed his young grandson "that the riches and honors of this world are not considered a very fitting appendage to the min- ister of Him who had not where to lay his head," but still ob- stinately refused to allow him to go as pastor to any congre- gation which should separate Sybil from himself; and there- fore when it began to be rumored about, that the dreaded day had come, and the good people of Hymeswold, leaded by Deacon Jones, had begun to demand another and a younger shepherd for their flock, and Charles Wallace was asked to supply his place, the blow, like many other dreaded calamities, fell very lightly when it came; for a noble fund had been raised, nearly all of which was given by Atherton, to give to the retiring minister an annuity much larger than the salary he had had so slenderly paid him; and instead of a " poor old age," for the first time in their lives Mr. and Mrs. Rogers laid their heads upon a pillow without "' the thorn;" and could look forward to long years, when Mattie should be happy again, and they, with their work done, should rest until the calling. The pastor of the little church of Hymeswold! What an end of the boy's ambitious hopes in life! But he dreams still;   CHESTNUT WOOD.         359 or no, his dreams are now exchanged for earnest work. Though his field seems small, he is no sluggard in the vineyard of his Lord. From the quiet beauty of Chestnut Wood, a voice, trum- pet toned, pleads for God and right. It wakes up an echo in far distant parts of the land. Thus shall Charles Wallace accomplish his mission. And Sybil, our gentle, beautiful Sybil, disturb her not by even a word. Drop softly over her the curtain which veils from public gaze the hallowed sanctities of home. Aunt Mary, too, is there; but she is changed. She has never looked back into life so happily since the time she tried to make herself willing to endure it without Sybil. But time and home, their home, will soon bring again the old smile; and Aunt Mary knows well where to look for present happi- ness and future good. The first wedding ceremony performed by the Rev. Mr. Wallace, was to unite in the holy bands of matrimony Mr. Jer- ry Goldsmith and Miss Margaret McMann. Nor was the wedding disturbed by the little tremblings of Miss Palmy Fitch, though she averred over and over again, that she heard them herself so loud, she expected every moment that the minister would stop to ask what the noise was. But sle had obstinately refused to make Jerry's wedding suit, and perhaps that was the reason, her repentance being very deep when she saw how spruce and handsome he looked from the work of the tailor with the red sign and golden letters; and for years afterwards she said she could not pass by the beau- tiful little cottage at the end of Mr. Atherton's garden, or see the happy face of Maggy, without a return of the little trem- blings in a way which really made her threaten to call the doc- tor. Jerry must have grown hard hearted; for altough these speeches of Miss Palmy's were duly repeated to him, he only laughed and said:-  &#xD;<pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC7089-00000181"/> 360        CHESTNUT YWOOD. "He would risk the old lady ; she was good for forty years more, at least; and if he was a life insurance company, no slight premium would be required for her. Not he; he had some notion of offering her a home, only he did not know but she might be another -Iethuselah. Arter all, she had been kind to him, and she should never want while either he or Blaggy lived; for he was a rich man, and though he said it limself, a much better one, than afore Mr. Atherton came to Hymeswold. He had been the making of him ; he always said so, and he would stick to it now, come what might." But what is to become of poor Old Dinah, who was patient- ly waiting for " for little Missis to open the great pearl gates." It matters not to her, for mingling together in her mind, uni- ted by that one golden thread which runs through all, there are pictures of the heavenly home, and her own bridal hut, far away under a southern sky; of the golden harp, and the an- gels' songs, and Pomp, and Rose, and little Miissis there, in that heavenly home; and of the fair young being, who came so softly in and knelt beside her, all dressed like the white robed angel, and told her that she was a bride; and so had she been once a bride, and she could see now the low cottage, and Pomp, and Rose, and little Missis, and hanging over all, the low, flowering branches of the dear, yellow jessamine.   asR   &#xD;</p>
