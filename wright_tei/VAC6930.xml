Almost anticipating the war mandate, there were   4 Privateers armed and even manned, ready to weigh anchor and spread    ' their canvas, and go forth to meet the enemy, the moment lettres-de-   F marque should be received. Long before a single government vessel had left her moorings, there were a score of saucy, rakish-looking clippers- ! built after the fakmous Baltimore model, celebrated. even to ,this day-- careening over the -billows, birds of ill olmen, indeed, to all merchantmen, i and to all light-armed cruisers, which dared to raise aloft the meteor flag of England.                              - How much the aggressions, which we propose to interweave into the plot of this ronmance, had in inciting the nation to promnpt action in seek. ing redress, we leave for our readers to judge, and without further intro- duction we commence the "plain, unvarnished tale," which we have set   t ourself the task to indite. - It was in the latter part of the month of September, A. D., 1811, some eight nlonths prior to the declaration of war by the young republic against her unnatural mother, that a large and staunch-looking ship, in lat. 49, Ion. 36, west of Greenwich, was bowling along at the rate of eight j knots per hour, with royals, studding sails, and every stitch of canvas that would draw, set to the breeze. The Timour, for that was her name, had sailed from the harbor of Havre, bound to Philadelphia, about ten days previously, with a rich cargo of silks, cloths, laces, wines, brandies, &amp;c., besides seventeen thousand dollars in gold and silver ingots. The ninth day out, Captain Fleetwood, as noble a commander as ever walked the quarter deck of a merchantman, was taken suddenly ill and died, and his body was consigned to the great deep. But, oh God! who shall de. scribe the anguish, the poignant grief, which well-nigh crushed the failr, lithe frame of one fair being, who clung to the mortal remains of her only earthly parent, from the sudden stroke which bore away his im. mortal spirit to the moment which tore her from the emhbrace of a form  ! she loved even in death?, At the final moment when the wave hid it forever from mortal ken, the sorrowing orphan sank upon the deck, overwhelmed with grief-unconscious-to all appearances, dead!             r The crew, who had been piped on deck to witness the funeral rites, stood aghast at the scene, and hardened villains, as many of them were,  they looked with a pitying eye upon the sylph-like form of the fair Fleta, the only child of their commander.                    4 A gallant-looking youth, who had been standing by the companion- w'ay, giving vent to a flood of grief, darted towards the unconscious maiden, the moment he saw that she had swooned upon the. deck, and    , exclaiming, "Oh, God! be merciful!" he lifted her in his manly arms and bore her into the, cabin. " Go to your duty, and leave the girl to me!" commanded the first mate, low captain of the Timour, in a gruff, stern voice, such as he had never ventured to use in that cabin before. "This is my duty!" replied Francis Willett, gazing upon his superior Afficer with astonishment not only at the command, but on account of the peremptory and unusual manner in which it was given. 4i Your duty is to obey my orders!" returned the newly,promoted Cap- tain Hawkwing, " and if I find you refractory, d-n my gizzard if I don't make a spread eagle of your proud carcass!"   TUB CRUIS  E of TIE CLXIPPERS.      :/' "Are you serious?"' questioned Willett, in incredulous tones. "By h--l! you will quickly find that I am, if you do not obey' me, and go to to your post on deck,!" "It is my watch be10w."- "Then  I 'll make it your watch on deck!-begone!" and he raised his arm in a menacing attitude. "Strike not, villain, at your peril!" cried Willett,-' as he, drew it pistol from his pocket, and aimed it at the breast of the brutal Hawk wing. "Mutiny, by God!" said he, retreating a step or two. "No  not mutiny!" cried the young man, yet clasping the fair girl in' his arms. "Listen to me, Hawkwing. The dying words of Captain Fleetwood were-' To you, Willett, 1 give in charge ny daug hter--you love her-she loves you-protect and honor her, as if she were already yours-swear to do this!' I did swear upon the Holy Book opened be fore his fast dimming eyes. That oath is registered in the eternal world, and may the Almighty crush-me as a worm of the dust, erej forget the vow. The injunction and oath were known to you at the time!  "Lying dog! 'tis false as hell!" muttered Hawkwing, grinding hi. teeth with rage. '4 Tis true as Heaven!" exclaimed the stewardess of the ship, rising from her berth, where she had been lying for twenty-four hours, aftlicted with an unknown illness, which threatened her life. "'Tis true a; Heaven! and you know it, Hawkwing." "Hell-cat! do vou conspire against me a By G-d! this is downright mutiny; but, remember, I am master of this ship, and I will see whether or not I am to be obeyed!" He turned upon his heel, and walked quickly up the companion-way. "Ah, Fleta-poor girl!" said the invalid, taking her from Willett'! arms; " better thus, than enduring the terrible anguish of the past twe days." "She must be quickly restored, even if she awoke to the keenest pangs mortal ever bore," said the young man; and he went into the deceased captain's state-room, and opening the medicine-chests took therefromi a vial of hartshorn which he gave into the hands of the stewardess. Then, obtaining a goblet of water, he, with his owni hands, laved her purely white temples, until her respiration became natural, and her pulse beat less wildly. Fleta at length opened her eyes, and essayed to speak, but she was too much exhausted to give utterance to woids. Meeting the fond and watchful gaze of Willett, she faintly smiled, closed her eyes, and fell into a deep slumber.: The stewardess, whp had acted as the femme-de-chambre of Fleta until prostrated by illness, now bore the Sleeping maiden to her state-room, and left her to that repose which was so essential to both body and mind, and then rejoined Willett-in the cabin. "Martha," said Willett, addressing the stewardess; " by your pale as- pect, I should judge that you have need of repose." "And you, too, Frank," replied Martha; " but," continued she in start- ling whispering speech; " have a care that you sleep not-I suspect foul play-- awkwing is a devil incarnate--look to your food-our poor Fle ta's father died suddenly--he may have been poisoned!" , "Poisoned " repeated the youth, amazed at the suggestion. "Great God! can this man, who until this hour has comported himself both as becomes an officer and a man, be a murderer 8V" "Hush! speak not so loud," enjoined the stewardess; "I have told you    <pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6930-00000004"/> "         :T a ;LYHnG YABn K; ' O, of my suspicions, but theyrequire, proof; moreover, I believe that I have d&amp;nak froma poisoned cup.; ,my ymnptoms were not unlike those of the captain's, but thanks to a rough sea and a violent .sea-sickness, :I have been rescued from the assassin's hand, and that which J dread more than deiith, an ocean burial." "Your words amaze me, Martha," said the youth; " would to Heaven I -hadthe proofs-Hawkwing or myself should not live an hour after- wards!" "Be cautious and vigilant, Frank, and the wretch's foul deeds may yet be detected.-But above all," continued Martha, pointing her finger signi- ficantly towards the state-room where slumbered the fair orphan, "-guard well vyour charge!" "With my life!" responded Willett, ardently. "If you are not already wellarmed, our lost captain's pistol-case you will find in-a small locker behind the medicine-chest. I -am too weak to -ay more at present." Uttering these words of direction, Martha sought her berth, which was in the state-room-next to that ocoupied by Fleta Fleetwood. Willett sank back in a chair almost confounded at the events of the last hour. It was true that his late beloved commander, of-whom he was a protege, and also second mate of the Timour, in solemn and-earn- est language placed Fleta -under his protection, and bound him with a willing oath, for the dying man knew that a strong mutual attachment existed between them. He knew well, too, the noble, gallant traits of character of Frank Willett, who was the son of a brave officer of the United States Navy, who fell in a sanguinary engagement with the bar- baric Tripolitans, in the year 1804, and in his dying hour exacted a like promise from Fleetwood, then a warrant officer, that he would protect his only son. That promise was faithfully kept; indeed, he could scarcely have done more -for him had he been his own child. Now, the time had come when he could repay his noble benefactor, not so disin- terestedly, perhaps, for the gallant youth -loved the fair Fleta with his whole soul. A sudden suspicion flitted across his brain that, perchance, Hawkwirg might be his rival! He had observed him frequently, prior to her father' decease, gaze with fondness upon her, an hd heard him speak kind words to her; yet the noble heart of Willett felt grateful because he treated her thus, rather than jealous at these trifling civilities; but now, and within an hour, in his eyes, the whole character of Hawkwing had changed-he was more of a demon than a man, and he must prepare himself for the worst conceivable emergency that might happen. The young man started from his seat, and rushed into the captain's state-room; the lid of the medicine-ehest was raised; he returned to the cabin and brought the vial to replace it. As he did -so, he was startled by the discovery that the bottle of poison was missing from its place! Here was another link in the chain of evidence against Hlawkwing! He. closedthe lid of the chest, and opening the locker, took from the case a pair of pistols of fine workmanship, and finding them already charged, he concealed them about his person and went upon deck.-Hawkwing, to his-surprise, was not at his post, nor was he to be seen. There was one man at the helm, another aloft, scraping down the fore-t'gallant mast, and the black cook, Quaoo, who was making his way from the. galley to the'cabin for the officers' mess. "Where's Mr. Hawkwing, Quaco, and the men of the watch!" asked Willett. ' ,Down de fo'castle,. sah," replied the negro, speaking in a low tone, so as not to be heard by the man at the wheel.   TH'I, CR'S. . i  t. h- fi -*:K . . W- ill]btt,'id ' o more, for 'he was foeiby. struck by the si'gular obsi; seln of thiigs upon deck, anid :somilheW t Aurprised to fid o fnd thattha e "beS, sailor aboard the ship was ,aldft, siraping7 the mast as a punishment. Tauirring iaround he satw Quaco's head just beneath the lide of tIh com- panion-way, making violent' gestures to himto come into the cabin. His -position was such tlat he could not be seen by the man at the wheel. Willctt'answered the strange summons, and met the negro at the foot df the companion-stairs, 'wth a countenance indicating the greatest alarm, and his body treinblirig form his cocoa-iiot shadped pate to his protrud ing heel. "Oh, sah," he exclaimed Wiih most rueful accents, "de debil ar to pay  'mung de crew. Dey hole council ob war in de fo'castle--de newT'epen hab send big Yankee Bob aloft, coz he no jirie 'em. Dem darn Ingleesh an' Ireesh mear to be de'deff ob you, Massa Willett-'-dey nmean to seTie de ship, and Massa Hawklwibg lub Missee Fleta so berry much he swear big oaf he will take her to Levypool and make her his wife." 'QQuaco, how know you all this?"'asked Frank.' "Wal, massa, I mu-s :tellee you," replied Quaco, scratching his woolly pate; "I muss tellee you bekase I heber lub to hab iinn'cent people suffer if dey isn't colored 'like myself. You muss now, sah, dat dis chile am in de plot--'es, massa, it am so, dough dey better not hab 'ticed Quaco to 'jine 'em, bekase, to siarbe you and dat lilly wite angel ob de cabin, me 'id blow 'em high-sky!  "Thanks, Quaco," said Willett; "but I must know the whole of this diabolical scheme." "'Es, sah--Quaco find ott--telle you all--no time now-'fore eight bell trike, de new capen come out -de fo'castle. Keep watch below 'till bell trike, den 'comie on deck, bekase, d'ye'see, de-debils must'nt find out dat you 'spicious ob dem."  .  - Uttering this caution in low tones, the negro darted out of the cabin to the galley, and continued his preparations for the officers' supper. It wanted but a few minuites to eight bells when Hawkwing's voice was heard on the - quarter-deck. Willett, thereupon, softly opened Fleta's state-room 'door, and finding that she was in a quiet slumber, c osed it again, turned the key, and put it- into his pocket. Eight bells struck and the young officer went on deck to resume his duties.-Hawkwing met him, and after giving some directions as to the ship's course, in a tone and ianner the reverse of that which he had assuied in the cabin but a short time previously, he went below.-  The'starboard watch had now all assembled on deck. and the larboard 'watch had' gone below, with the' ingle exception of Robert Barington- 'called Yankee Bob, aid sometimes Burly Bob, from his immense -sise 'and, great muscular pdoers. -Bob was a true hearted Sailor; he had been 'an espcial favorite of Captain Fleetwood, aSld ere -he diedl Bob was called to his bedside, and was informded' that in- case of his death, he must as- sume the duties of second mateinh place of Willett, who would 'theln be promoted to the berth of first officer, while Hawkwing would take the command 6f the' ship. This sariagement Was' make known to the' latter, who applaihded the appointmenit; and yet, on Bob's taking- his place in the larboard watch, Hawkwing ordered him' forward,: saying, that he de- ried the former captain's prerogative to appoint his subordinates, 'and that when he had found the best mant of the'whole crew, 'he should raise him to the post of second officer. Bariiigton remonstrated at this Cinwarrantable assumption, -and re- minded his tyrannical-superior of the lack of respect he evinced towards    <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6930-00000005"/> S       TiHZ FLYING YANKEE; OR, the noble commander they had so recently consigned to an ocean grave. Upon this, Hawkwing, in a paroxysm of rage, ordered him aloft to per- fornm the menial service of scraping a spar-,a service always reserved for punishing refractory seamen-threatening his life if he was not obeyed. There was no alternative, and Baringtan went to do the tyrant's behest. "Aloft, there!" sang out Willett, as soon as he had ordered a light to be placed in the binnacle, and had seen that the sails were in good trim. Ay, ay, sir," responded the big sailor, in a gruff voice. "Down out that rigging; that's no place for you," shouted Willett. Bob didn't wait for a second summons, nor did he deign to step foot upon the ratlines, but seizing the top-gallant halliards, he landed on deck in a moment. "Mr. Barington," said Willett, loudly, so as to be heard by most of the watch, "you are the second mate of this ship, under anthority of her late commander and chief owner. Men," continued he, addressing the sailors, " obey Mr. Barington as the second officer of this ship." There was no response; the men looked at each other with a sullen and dissatisfied expression, and as the young man went aft, some sneer- ing and even sinister observations grated harshy upon his ear; yet he pretended to take no notice of it, and gave his orders as if he suspected nothing, and as if nothing had taken place to create distrust; yet his whole soul was alive to the danger which threatened the ship; he felt convinced that a diabolical conspiracy had been formed between Hawk- wing and a major part of the crew, to seize the vessel, and to put all to death who were not in the mutinous and murderous plot. He now re- garded Hawkwing in the light of a bloody demon, and as he gazed upon the men now on deck, they looked like so many buccaneers, whose whole lives had been continued scenes of plunder and carnage, and he wondered that they had not so appeared to him before. During nearly the whole of the evening he paced the quarter deck, revolving in his mind various schemes to thwart the designs of the in. famous plotters, and occasionally looking down through the sky-light of the cabin to see if any one was astir below.-Twice he crept down softly to the rooml of the fair Fleta, but finding her slumbering as sweetly a3 an infant, he crept stealthily back to his post. Six bells ("P. M.) had struck. No sooner had the sharp vibrating soullds ceased, than the watcher saw the dead-light, directly over Hawk- wing's state-rooml, suddenly illuminate, although his watch below had yet another hour before its expiration. Willett was alarmed at this cir- cutnstance; quickly but noiselessly he darted down into the cabin, and concealed himself in his own room, directly opposite to that occupied by Fleta, and by taking the key from the door, he was enabled to see any moyemeuts in that direction. In. a ew moments Hawkwing appeared, without doubt fully intent upon as dire a piece of villany as can be found recorded in the annals of crime. The vile wretch, like a venomous ser- pent, crawled silently towards the door of his intended victim, and on finding it locked and the key gone, he uttered a hissing, hellish maledic- tion upon the head of him whose eye was then upon him! He then pro- cured other keys, but the bolt would not yield. Foiled in his attempt to steal into the presence of the innocent and lovely sleeper, he again re- tired, resolving to take a more favorable opportunity to accomplish his infernal purpose, but first of all to crush his more favored rival. Had he possessed that courage which usually accompanies a sanguinary villain, he would have sought Willett upon the deck at once, and put an end to his career by a single blow of his sabre, or a bullet from his pistol; but   THE CRUISE o THE CLIPPERS. .       ' the wretch was cowardly, and preferred to work with darker, more secret agents, in carrying out his infamous schemes.         - Again did Willett return to his post, and gave orders for reducing sail, as the wind had freshened, and on consulting the barometer, he found almost certain indications of a storm. Studding-sails were taken in, royals furled, and the courses hauled up, but the wind increased so suddenly, it was necessary to call the larboard watch. The boatswain's cry of "'All hands on deck t" was heard at the forecastle just as seven bells struck, and the men tumbled out of their berths and, half-clad, they quidkly appeared on deck. Both watches were now set at work, furling top-gallant sails, sending down the royal-yards, reefing topsails, and making everything taut and snug alow and aloft to meet the impending gale. Willett's loud but musical voice was heard above the roar of the ele- ments, giving his orders judiciously and at the precise moment they were most needed, evincing great judgment and the utmost coolness in the hour of danger. There were no threats, no curses, mingled with his commands, but they were given in a manner as if he meant that they were to be obeyed with alacrity, and, notwithstanding the undoubted disaffection of the crow, never did men work with a more seeming hearty good'will. Hawkwing, from the companion-wty, had stood and witnessed the admirable manner in which his subordinate had caused the ship to be put in a condition to battle with the elements, and as he came on to the quarter deck to re- lieve him, he absolutely complimented him for it, and begged that he would overlook what had occurred between them a few hours before. "Let that pass," said Willett, and without further reply, went into the cabin to pass his four hours below in watching instead of sleeping. There was no danger in the howling of the storm-god, and in the billows lashed into, a fury, but the youth felt there was more to be feared from demons in human shape than in the combined power of the elements in their wildest mood. CHAPTER 1I. The poisoned cup. Martha's device. Hawkwing caught in his own trap. Quaco's aarning. Throwing the log. The assassin Joiled. A juwt punishment. ANOTHER black day to record in the log oftheTimour. Eight bells struck, denoting the hour of four, which summoned the starboard watch to duty. Morning had dawned, but it brought no abatement of the storm; the clouds wore a yet more threatening aspect than on the preceding evening, and the barometer had fallen during the night. Orders were immediately given by. Willett to send down the royal-yards, close reef the main anid fore topsail, and set the main trysail. The ship, even under so slight a canvas, careened over the angry billows at a fearful rate, and., each heavy roller which followed seemed mighty enough to engulph that richly freighted barque. .Yet the staunch Timour 'behaved nobly, and despite her bending spars, and straind cordage, she was yet under the helmsman's control. As morning advanced the wind lulled slightly, though not suffi- ciently to warrant the shaking out of a single reef. Willett was now summoned to breakfast by Quaco, and on entering the cabin, he was not a little astonished to find Hawkwing at the table, as it had not been the custom of the captain to mess with the mate in the morning. Quaco-    <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6930-00000006"/> V     -ATH     FLYIfG YANKXZ ; Oo, appeared with the hot coffee and set it before the captain, who filled up tihe cups, and was about to pass one to the mate, when a terrible shriek ivs heard from the state-room of the stewardess, who, with dishevelled ihair, and altogether frightful aspect, staggered into the cabin. The captain and mate sprang from their feet, startled at the wild and spectral appearance of Martha. "For God's sake what's the matter "' ejaculated Hawkwing. "'Tis here I here,!" she cried in tones of piercing anguish, placing her hand violently upon her breast, as if she would tear the flesh, and then striking her forehead violently. "I burn-I burn!"' she continued; " my brain's on fire, and I have a hell in my bosom! Oh, agony, agony! I suffer all the torments of the damned. Run! quick! -get me something to alleviate these dreadful pangs!" Hawkwing took a wine-glass and went to the medicine-chest to prepare a dose for her. The moment he closed the door, she said quickly, in a whisper,- "Change those cups-the one intended for you is poisoned! I saw the wretch pour a white powder into it before the coffee was brought in! You have had a narrow escape! Have I not acted my part well F' "I'm amazed!" said Willett, at this discovery. "Change the cups-quick-he is coming!" urged Martha. "I cannot assassinate even my foulest enemy in so mean a way, though I could slay him when he is on his guard," said the noble youth. "Then that duty be mine; the ship must be rid of this demon, or we are lost," said she, as she hastily did that which the tnate had declined to do. Hawkwing returned a moment afterwards, bearing a wine-glass filled with a deep red liquid, and placing it in Martha's hand, he said,- Drink this, and all will soon be well." "Thanks, oh, thanks!" she replied, as if still in great bodily agony, and repaired to her state-room, but instead of quaffing the suspicious-looking potion, she laid the glass aside, and took a position so that she could ebserve the result of her plot, through a lattice aperture above the door. "The deed is done!" she whispered to herself, as she saw the monster pass the untainted cup to his intended victim, and raise the drugged one to his own lips. A stifled chuckle of exultation, and the resolute woman fell back, almost overpowered by the part she had enacted. Hawkwing had, indeed, put the poisoned cup to his lips, and had quaffed a portion of its contents, just at the moment Willett was drink- ing freely of the grateful beverage from the pure dup. Their 'eyes met in one penetrating gaze while they drank! A sudden paleness spread over the brutal captain's face! The hand which held the cup shook like an aspen leaf! His eyes gleamed with a fierce, unnatural light! Did he suspect that he had been caught in the deadly snare he had set to entrap another? Did his cowardly soul quake with- terror, at the mere thought that he was a doomed man? 'He dashed the half-drained cop down upon the table, started up and hastily withdrew to his state-room, probably to seek an antidote'against the infernal draught! Willett read, in those suddenly changed features, the fearful suspicion which had flashed across the brain of his wicked 'enemy; but he evinced no emotion, finished his repast, and went'upon deck, as if naught bad occurred.   TH i CRUISE OF TH .CLIPPERBI       ,1- The forenoon watch had almost expired, and no further incident worth recording had happened. The storm-king had by no meais ;spent his fury but howled on, lashing the ocean into a sheet of foam, and driving the Timour onward with terrific velocity, sometimes almost burying. her- self Deneath the yesty surface, then rising as if to shake the spray from the full-length Tartar chieftain that adorned her bow. The hours of the morning watch wore slowly away, and when eight bells struck, calling the captain's watch,'he failed to make his appearance. Willett, calling a young reefer, sent him below-to announce. t him the hour, expecting, however, that he would return with the intelligence that. 'Hawkwing was dead. The;bpy, after an unusual absence of ten minutes, returned with a report that the captait was sick, and must leave his duties with him for the present. As the boy went forward, he slippeida. piece of paper into the hands of Manuel, the boatswain, a stout, swarthy- complexioned Portuguese, who; suddenly disappeared with it into the cook's. galley. Soon afterwards, Quaco, with a pile of newly-washed plates in his hands, came fbith, and made his way in a zig-zag course, ,owards the cabin, but he took especial care to "tack-ship" when-within a half fiathom's distance from Willett, and, then without seeming to stop,. for the motion of a ship in a heavy sea is a good excuse for a staggering gait, he let drop a few words of startlingilnport:- ' Gorra-mity, massa, you be sharks',meat bery soon-capen send order to debil Portegy to make way wid mate when he gib order to frow the log-keep eye wide open-dam rascal hole lot ob dem." This was a timely warning, and he had nearly two hours before 'four bells (10 A. M.) when the speed, of the ship would again:be ascertained. There was only one man aboard Ship, besides the cunning Quaco, that' he could rely upon, and this was Yankee Bob, whohad discharged the duties of second officer without -the least remonstrance from Hawkwing, not- withstanding hehad determined that the boatswain should act in that capacity,.and had even promised him the ,berth, and also that of first mate, when they could make it convenient to rid the ship of the former captain's proteg6, and the favored one of the-beautiful Fleta. 'Willett seized the first favorable opportunity to communicate with the second mate, inform him of the hellish conspiracy, and placed in his possession weapons for defence. It was nearly four bells when the order was given to bring the log-reel and glass aft. Two men, besides Manuel, appeared on the quarter-deck, one of whom was a strapping son of th Elllerald Is18, and the other a bull-headed Englishman. The boatswain held the glass, and the two nen the reel, while Willett held the lin e,;whiih, as soon as he had thrown it over, and sang out-"Turn the glass 1i the boatswain whizzed it at his head! then drawing a murderous-looking blade, he raised his arm and rushed furiously uponi him to deal a deadly blow!,But the mate's quick eye was upon the assassin's every movemenit; he seized his wrlist suddelily and firmly while the blow was descendfint,at the same time tripped his feet from under himn so quickly, that ihe fell Tfoward upon the tafferel; simultaneously a. heavy sea struck the ship--he lost his balance, andid in another moment he was struggling, with the mighty waves I The ship seemed to leap ifrom the spot wherA he felj, and the Portuguese assassin's (accursed visage, was visible no longer!    , The accomplices of the mutinous 'boatswain stood confounded at the loss of their. leder in the. attempt to carry. out Hawkwing's bloody man. date. A few moments elapsed, when one of the villains mustering courage, cried out,-                   . j    <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6930-00000007"/> 12         TH JLYING YANKEX; OR, "Vengeance! vengeance Down with this proud upstart! Let's avenge our shipmate's death!" "Ay, ay," said the other, taking courage. Both of the saiiors drew their knives, and rushed twards the object of their hatred, expecting to overpower him with the greatest ease; but they halted as suddenly as if struck by a thunderbolt; for, besides Willett's brilliant eyes frowning upon them, a pair of iron tubes met their gaze! Had they advanced another step, a couple of leaden bullets would have been lodged in their skulls, for their antagonist, young as he was, was a dead shot t "Give me your knives l' he commanded, with a coolness which would have become a much older head; " disobey me at your peril!" The discomfited mutineers, like a pair of whipped Spaniels, fairly crouched before their superior, and gave up their weapons. "Edged tools are dangerous in the hands of curs," quietly observed Willett, taking the knives and throwing them overboard. "Now we'll see if we cannot have the log thrown without these annoying interrup- tions. "Go," he continued, addressing one of the sailors, " and send aft another man-a better man, if there's one among you all, than he who has just left us to join his master in the infernal world!" The order was obeyed; the log was thrown, and it was ascertained that the ship was making twelve knots, although she was running under close-reefed fore and main topsails, and main trysail. During the remainder of the watch there were no further demonstrations made by the mutineers, but on the contrary every order from the quarter-deck was obeyed with commendable promptitude. The day wore away without any further occurrences of a startling nature. Night came-there was no moon, no stars-naught visible but the surging waves below, and the fiercely-driving clouds above. Towards morning there was a cry which struck terror to innocent hearts as well as guilty souls!-"Oh, God! be merciful!" was the prayer of more than one wretch who never prayed before. CHAPTER III. The storm at its height. The lover's resolve. A leak! a leak! The in- ebriated crew. Hawkwing humbled. Scene at the pumps. The bloody fight. Desperate condition of the ship. The long boat. The miscre- ants desert the ship, without booty or beauty. THE wind, that had for many hours blown a gale from the east, sud- denly veered round to the southwest, betokening moderate weather; but the Timour's crew were doomed to disappointment; for, anon, a cloud of impenetrable darkness rolled up from the southwestern horizon, so dense In appearance, that it seemed the very concentration pf the angry, fierce masses of vapor which had curtained the whole heavens since the begin- ning of the gale. So sudden was the change in the wind, it met the ship unawares; the sails flapped violently against the mast, threatening to tear themselves from the bolt-ropes. The summons of "All hands on deck!" brought up the watch below, and by swaying away at the braces, the ship, which had lain for some minutes all aback, was finally hove-to. Soon, flashes of lightning, and the rumbling of distant thunder, added   THU CRUIS3 OF THa CLIPPERS,        i3 terror to the already perilous scene. Onward rolled the black mass-- more vividly flashed the lightning's bolt, and louder and louder crashed heaven's artillery. A mighty rushing wind was heard; it moved over the waters, crushing the ridged, foam-crested waves in its course. Every man was at his post, under orders of Willett, who stood upon the quar. ter-deck, with the speaking-trumpet in his hand, waiting for the impend- ing danger.--There was no expression of fear visible in his countenance  he looked calmly yet resolutely, while others awaited the anticipated shock with fear and trembling. Even Hawkwing, pale and haggard from the effects of powerful emetics he had swallowed to counteract the insi- dious poison which he believed he had unwittingly taken, crawled upon the deck, with an aspect more resembling a fiend shorn of his strength, than like an imbecile human being. The wild sublimity of the scene, and the impending dangers seemed to revivify his enervated energies. lie glanced with a bewildered look above and around, and his eye rested for a few moments upon him, on whose sole responsibility seemed to rest the salvation of that tempest-tossed barque, and the treasures which she bore.-As he contemplated his gallant bearings and witnessed his admir- able display of seamanship, he almost relented the secret, cowardly attempt he had made upon his life; for at that moment he could not avoid admitting that, without his enemy's exertions, the Timour was, indeed, a doomed ship. Then his thoughts recurred to the fair F!eta, who, he had sworn, should be his; and, also, to his soul-cherished scheme of enriching himself, and his companions in the iniquitous plot, by making the ship and her treasures their own. He had gone too far to retrace his steps-the captain had fallen by his hands-his plot he feared was dis- covered-more innocent blood must be shed, ere his g9lden dream could be realized. His confederates, comprising two-thirdes of the crew, he knew could be implicitly relied upon, for it was their purpose, as well as his own, when they shipped aboard of the Timour, to seize her on the first favorable opportunity. The mutinus plot had been concocted ashore, at Havre. While thus ruminating, the storm-cloud burst its, fury upon the ship. It was a fearful moment-the ship careened upon the wave, and was nearly thrown upon her beam ends-the fore and main top-gallant mast, and the mizzen topmast, were twisted off as easily as if they had been but reeds-the main topsail burst like the report of a musket, while the fore topsail was shaken and riddled into shreds-the masts bent, and the stout ribs creaked as if they would burst asunder-she reeled and stag- gered beneath the mighty blow, like a tottering edifice shaken by the runmblipg of an earthquake. Lightning, thunder and rain, accompanied the rushing wind-crash upon crash, peal upon peal, succeeded each other, as if they would rend the sky; while the bolts, like flaming me- teors, darted athwart the gloomy canopy with startling fierceness. Hearts that were never before appalled while the elements raged, quailed before the sublime but awful spectacle, But there was one who stood calmly on the quarter deck, directing every movement, unheeding all but his stern duty, and giving encouragement to th. awe-stricken crew. This was our hero, Frank Willett, who looked sc ething more than the commander -he seemed almost a god. In themidst of these terrific concussions of the enraged elements, a lithe, sylph-like form, like an angel of light, glided up the companion- way, flitted by the dark, soul-awed Hawkwing, and once more stood by the side of her youthful protector, and clung to his garments as if for support,    <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6930-00000008"/> "         BHE FLYINQ T YAO ; OR, "Oh, God' ' she cried, gazing around upon the angry waste of waters and upward to the still more portentous sky, tis a fearful sight " It is, indeed, Fleta," he replied, in calm. tones; "but the deck is no place for you-there's much less danger below." "Then why, yourself, remain on deck'i-You have watched, Marths tells me, when others should have relieved you." "I dare not rest-my post of duty is here." "But 'tis useless to combat against fate. Shall we not all perish!" she asked with a look of fearful apprehension. God' only knows, my Fleta," he- answered; "we are in the hands of an all-wise Providfence, and must wait his decree. A storm so violent as this I never experienced before; come, Fleta, let me lead you to the cabin." "SOh, no, Frank If i be God's will that we perish, let me remain near you,' said she, clingirg more closely to him, and gazing into his face with an earnest and imploring expression of countenance. "Oh, Frank, listen to my only wish: if the ocean is to be be our grave, I shall not dread death, to die clinging as I now do to thee. To sink nto the fathomless abyss: alone, and thou, too, apart from me-oh, Heavens! the very thought is horrible!" "Let no such thoughts distract thee, Fleta; for I have &amp;.vow recorded in the eternal world to protect Mu0u; whilst you live, my life is devoted to you. if it be God's will that we perish in this storm, fear not-- shall be- near you in- our last moments." "Oh t thanks! thanks!" she replied, in grateful accents; "the raging elements have no terrors for me! I can. how die resignedly and happily During this brief interview, the tornado had passed by, leaving - the tempest raked barque yet upon the surface of the waters. "The blue sky, was,welcomed in the west, and fiery 'redtAints penetrated the still gloomy veil in the east. "See, Fleta, the elements have done their worst; the storm has passed by, and though we have suffered in the loss of sails, spars and rigging, yet we are afloat. Go below now." "Yes, Frank! I shall ever be guided by thee. He took her tenderly by the hand, and led her to the companion-stairs, near which yet stood the demoniae-looking Hawkwing, one more to be dreaded, in Willett's eyes, than the warring of the gods of sea, earth, or air. No sooner had tieta disappeared into the cabii, than a cry was heard, which struck more terror to the hearts of the mariners, than the stormy perils they had for days encountered. "A leak! a leak!' was that shul degpaiting cry. "Sound the pumps, Mr. Baringtol," was Willet t first order, address- lug the second mate. "Ay,  y, sir," responded the deep bass toned voice of Yankee Eiob. The pumps were sounded, ahd four feet of water reported. Man the brakes, boys i" said he to the nearest sailors, then turning to the carpenter, he ordered him to go into the hold, and if possible, ascertain 'the extent of the leak, and devise heanfis' to check the inflowing of the Water,  This was a difficult task, for the- hold of the ship was closely stowed with pipes, barrels, hampers,' &amp;tc. With the assistande of another, the carpenter finally succeeded in working his way far enough towardsathe   THE CRUISe OF THB CLIPPt.   '   '  kelson, to find th4t, several large seams were opened between the planks, caused by the excessive wrenching she had experienced in the height of the storm. Though the cause of so much water in the hold was discov- ered, it was utterly impossible to repair the miany breaches through which it flowed. To do it effectually, or in part, would involve the un- lading of the heaviest portion of her cargo. This disastrous state of things was reported to ourhero, (Hawkwing still maintaining, an indiffer- ence, a sullen inactivity,) who saw at once, that there was no hope of keeping the ship afoat, unless through iricdssant working of the pumps, and unless they were capable of discharging the water as rapidly as it made in the hold. Accordingly he subdivided the crew into pump-gangs of four each, and for a long time succeeded in keeping the brakes con- stantly in motion. Considering the alarming extent of the disaffection of the crew, the several gangs took their turns without murmuring, but the gain upon the leak was Plight; yet the danger of foundering was not imminent so long as it did not increase. At 12 o'clock, meridian, the sun, which had not been clearly visible for several days, once more shed its cheering rays upon that strange ship's comp'any; the wind had lulled to a' soft summer breeze, and the white. capped waves had given way to the long, lazy swell of the ocean in a comparative calm. The only order which Hawkwing had given in the meantime, was, to serve out grog-to each of the pump-hands. To this there was no objie- tion, but when the order was thrice repeated, at, too short intervals, Wil- lett remonstrated, and countermanded it in the very teeth of Hawkwing, whom he determined no longer to acknowledge as his superior, and com- manded Quaco, who served it, to return the liquor to the spirit-room, a order which the negro was not slow in obeying. The hitherto pallid face of Hawkwing was suddenly suffused with blood --his complexion became a deep scarlet; his deep set, villanous eyes, gleamed like those of a venemous reptile, and he ground his teeth with rage.  "Hell and furies! what do J hear? what's the meaning of all this?' he ejaculated with all the vehemence his debilitated frame pos- sessed. "'Tis not well that the men should be made drunk, in the hour of peril," answered Wlllett quietly, and scarcely heeding the brutal man's anger. "Young hell-hound, do you or I command this ship?" demanded the infuriated man.  "I!"' thundered out Willett.; ; I command when my superior has lost his senses. If you would have the ship go to the bottom, give the crew free access to the spirit-room." "By all the fiends in hell!" these are brave words for a stripling to' us to his commander," replied the monster, gaining strength by his excite ment. ' Grog they shall have, ay, plenty of grog! I say, boys,' address- ing the men; - this beardless boy would stop your grog-you know the way to the spirit room-.go, and help yourselves!' .  .' The gang at the pumps dared not move, for the stern gaze of him, whose power they had had a foretaste of, was upon them; but several men who were standing near the galleys, sang out- The captain, forever!" Grog, shipmates, grog!"' "Heave ahead, my hearties, let's go and splice the main-brace!" With these and a volley of similar phrases, these men rushed pell-mell down into the spirit-room, ore means could be used to prevent them;    <pb n="16-17 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6930-00000009"/> 1 TUB FLYINO YANKEB] ; OR, they soon returned to the deck, in quite a merry condition, with each oif their monkey jackets laden with a brace of bottles of brandy. There is no more certain way of utterly destroying the discipline of a ship, than by indulging seamen in a too free use of ardent spirits. As may be supposed, the state of the Timour's crew, after the " stolen bot- tle" had circulated freely from one mouth to another, and all had stowed away an inordinate quantity of the fiery liquid, without condescending to dilute it even slightly with water, was deplorable indeed-they seemed like so many demons, mocking at decency, danger and death! For a time they seemed totally indifferent as to whether the ship foundered or not, or whether or not they were engulphed with her, Nothwithstandlmg the inebriated condition of the crew, there were some six or eight who had been kept comparatively sober, through -the efforts of the first and second fntes. Four of these comprised the gang now working the punmps, but watching the insubordinate spirit of their shipmates, and being en. couraged by that arch-villain, Hawkwing, they ceased working. "I'll pump no more!' cried one of the boldest of the gang.  "Nor I! Nor 1! Nor I!" echoed his messmates. " Then say your prayers!" exclaimed our gallant hero, suddenly appearing before the mutinous rascals with bared arms, and with a pistol in each hand; for as sure as there is an avenging Deity in Heaven, I'll blow- the first man's brains out who leaves the pumps without my orders." He levelled the weapons at the miscreants, and well did they know from his determined aspect, that if he hut touched the trigger, two of them atleast would be hurried into the eternal world, with the most enormous crimes resting upon their souls. They glanced a meaning look at each other, and upon him who stood in such a threatening aspect, and, tremnblingly, they resumed their'work. Still the mutinous disposition- of the crew generally, was by no means quelled,cand when the next gang was called, they came staggering aft, lacked by others, and uttering horrid oaths and bullying expressions. , Blow away and be (hie) d--d!" cried one, more intoxicated than the others, as he lost his equilibrium, and rolled into the lees *euppers.

' Down vith the hinfernal Ynnkee mate!" shouted a third, "three sheets in the wind," as he flourished an empty junk bottle over his head, and then let it drive at Willett, but it widely missed its mark; took effect on the thick skull of a braggart Brazilian, and levelled him so. the deck, which circumstance caused a bit of a fray among them- selves.

Meanwhile these inebriated wretches were held at bay, others had crept down between decks, and had succeeded in removing a plank of bulk-heads, and thus were enabled to get into the spirit-room, in a differ- ent way from thaet of their comrades, The truth flashing upon Willett's mind, he sent Barington below to oppose them. "Back! back!" commanded the second-mate, reaching the spirit-room as quickly as did the men, and taking a position at the door-way; ad- vatnce another step at your peril!" "Stand out o' the way, you d-d son of a Yankee sea-cook, or I'll knife you!" threatened the foremost of the gang, darting towards him, brandishing a naked blade, followed by his shipmates, similarly armed. But their mad career was suddenly checked. Besides pistols, Baring- ton had armed himself with a heavy sabre from the arm-chest, and with one well-directed, heavy blow, the skull of the ruffian was cleft in twain, and as he fell the blood and brains from the divided head bespattered his mutinous comrades!  They fell back aghast at the sight of the gory spectacle! Horror and dismay were pictured upon their brutal countenances!-They turned from the dreaded executioner, who stood with uplifted arm to annihilate the next who should have the temerity to approach within reach of his powerful arm, and rushed upon deck, uttering the most hideous and woe- ful yells. Hawkwing, while this scene was transpiring, had absented himself from the deck, and repaired to his state-room. To drown the mortifica- tion he felt at being brow-beaten, his power fairly usurped, and his dia- bolical schemes defeated by him he regarded as a mere'stripling, he, in imitation of his miserable, cowardly supporters, had resort to the intoxi- cating cup. Potation after potation of the fiery liquid he quaffed; it did not seem to intoxicate him, but rather to nerve his arm and give him that courage which he felt he so much needed in the impending crisis. Again did he resolve to make a desperate effort to carry out his hellish designs, and crush his antagonist, who seemed to him almost invulnerable, or be himself annihilated in the attempt. Just as he re-appeared upon deck, the startling cry of "Six feet of water in the hold!" reached his ear "Why the d--d old hulk js sinking!" exclaimed the wretch, as he went forward among a knot of sailors grouped around the foremast. "The long-boat!" suggested one of the group. "That's it* boys!" cried Hawkwing; "out with the long-boat! But, hark-ye, those infernal Yankees must not leave the ship-let them sink in the d--d old sieve! That shall be our revenge. She'll be hatches under in two hours!" There was quite a general response to this proposition, and they set about the work with alacrity. "You, Barney, and you, Sam, come with me," said Hawkwing to a brace of his sworn friends; "I've a treasure or two that must be rescued 'from this sinking hulk." Saying this, he quietly disappeared down the fore-hatch, followed by two of his accomplices. The men who were getting out the long-boat worked as if life depended upon their exertions, and in an incredibly short time the boat was floating alongside.   THB CRUISB OF TuH CLIPPERS. I Ttgese movements of course did not escape either Willett's or Bar- ington's observation. "What's to be done, Mr. Willett " asked the robust seaman, who stood wondering at the seeming indifference manifested by him whom he ,now regarded as his commander. "'Tis useless to oppose these frantic men, while they feel that they are working for their lives," replied our hero. "Perhaps it were best under the circumstances, that we should be rid of them. In all probability, the ship will float for some hours longer." "I think," said' Barington, "there are several, who, if a word of en- couragement were dropped into their ears, would prefer to stick by the ship, than to abandon her with those piratical wretches." "Well thought of," replied our hero. "Go forward, Mr. Barington, and speak only to, those whom you deem can be trusted; tell such to come aft and report themselves." The second mate went about his delicate task, and out of the remaining crew of thirty men, he could select only four who were not bound, both body and soul, to do the wicked behest of the bestial Hawkwing.-These reported themselves, one by one, to Willett. "Remain by the ship," said he to each of them, "and we shall be ena- bled to keep her afloat until, perhaps, a sail will discover our disabled condition and take us from the wreck; but, as a last resort,. we have the jolly boat, in good condition. Our chances of life, even if we are com- pelled to put off in the boat, will be fu)ly equal to theirs. For my own part, I had rather go down with the ship, than to embark. with .those madmen in the long boat. Stand by me, and, rely upon it, we cannot fare worse thah they." Each of them swore to stand by him to the last. The truth is, they were discerning men; they had faith in Willett, for they had witnessed his gallant bearing throughout the -many perils they had encountered. The mutinous conspiracy, which developed itself after the Timour had left port, they seemingly acquiesced in, simply because they dared not oppose; and, moreover, enough had unwittingly been revealed in the forecastle, to convince them that Hawkwing was a buccaneer chief, and that a good portion of the crew had been under his commrand when in that capacity. From the arms-chest, which from the first had been under Willett's safe keeping, these volunteers on the side of right and duty, were supplied each with a sabre and a pair of pistols, which they hid be- neath their garments, ready for use in case of an emergency ; all of which was accomplished without being discovered by those who were preparing diligently to abandon the ship in the long boat. After getting quite a large supply of provisions, and other necessaries aboard the boat, and the crew were making their final preparations to embark, it was found that when they should all get aboard, she would be laden nearly to the gunwales. This was a result which they had not calculated upon, in their anxiety to obtain provisions enough to last them until they. should reach the Azores, to which group of islands they had determined to shape their course. "Why not have the jolly-boat, too V" suggested one of the men, as a relief from their sudden dilemma. "Ay, ay, the jolly-boat!" responded a dozen voices, and they started in a body to go aft, and possess themselves of that also, and thus take fway one less hope of life, for those who remained by Willett., "Now, comrades, show your courage!" exclaimed our hero, as the reckless crew approached. "Villains are always cowards-be men, and we can easily defeat their present purpose."    <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6930-00000011"/> "Ah! we have traitors among us!" shouted one of the gang, as they saw four men ready to oppose them, that they had counted upon as their own; ," but, down with 'em, shipmates." "Ay, death to traitors!". shouted another. "By hell! we must -have the jolly-boat if w; die for it!" cried a third. "' The jollythoat you cannot have," said. Willett, unawed by their num- bers; " and he who advanbes one foot abaft the capstan, will pay dearly for his temerity!" This threat they disregarded, and seizing the capstan-bars they rushed on, expecting with such formidable weapons to annihilate all who should oppose them. Crack, crack, went a half dozen pistols in rapid succession, followed by heavy sabre blows, and six or eight of the assailants fell. upon the deck, either killed or mortally wounded, at the first attack. Infuriated at the loss of their comrades, they rallied again, and met with a second repulse. In the very midst of this sanguinary melee, Martha, the stewardess, ap- peared, and picking up the discharged pistols which had been ithrown upon the deck, she reloaded theni, and thus materially assistedin making a successful defence. Quaco, also, did good service in saving Baring- ton's life by warding off the blow of u, capstan-bar levelled at his head, and knocking the assailant senseless to the ,deck with the butt, of a pistol - As we have before written, Hawkwing had disappeared from the deck with his followers, at the time it was determined upon to abandon the ship in the long-boat. He had managed to steal into the cabin by. the bulkhead, and while the battle was raging upon the deck, had violently seized uponFleta. The rudeness'of the wretch had caused her to swoon. His accomplies, meanwhile, were engaged in securing a prize of a totally different character. This brutal attempt at forcible abduction was not discovered until the miscreant made :his apparance on deck, bearing in his arms the unfortunate maiden towards the gangway. One minute more and he would have borne her into the boat; but a timely alarm was given by Quaco. Like an enraged lion, our'hero sprang forward, with sabre in hand,. clearing the way of all who stood in' his path, and confronted Hawkwing, just as he had placed his foot upon the:top of the gangway steps., He struck the villain with a blow upon the arm which clasped ,the maiden around the waist. The limb, fell. powerless by his side, and Fleta fell upon the deck. Several of the disaffected sailors rushed to their master's rescue, which preventedWillett from annihilat- ing him..                 .       i "Ah, ha!" laughed Hawkwitg, with a satanie expression, as h.'saw that-his fiery antagonist-was kept-at bay'; " think'sti thou to thwart me  in:the moment of triumph? This, rash stripling, for thy interference!' and he deliberately aimed a pistol at Willett's head and fired. There were the flash, the report and the smoke, but no farther effects followed. ' Our hero stood as unharmed as if he had borne a charmed life! Hawkwing, gnashing his teeth with rage, drew another pistol and fired, with the same, to him, unaccountable result. Barington had now come to the aid of Willett, who quickly made his way. again' within reach of the wretch, and in another'moment would have annihilated him, had he not, perceiving his danger, suddenly leaped overboard, and finally succeeded in crawling:into the long-boat, dripping with his unpremeditated bath. Martha was summoned, and lifting the unconscious Fleta in her arms, bore her to the cabin.   THE CRUISE' OF THE CLIPPERS.        1 The mutinous crew made no farther demonstrations, being entirely overawed at the loss of so. many companions, and the seemingly invinci- ble character of their antagonists. "Begone, miscreants!" commanded our hero, addressing those who still lingered upon the Timour's deck.  They needed not a second order, for over the gangway they clambered as quickly as possible. "Cut the painter!" cried out Willett to Barington. "Ay, ay, sir!"         '  "Hould on a bit, darlint!" cried O'Brunner, coming up the fore- hatchway with his cockney messmate, each with a bag 'cntaining. some- thing of-great weight.  "Not a second-!" answered Barington, .as'l he-severed the rope:which held the boat alongside the ship, and she quickly drifted astern. "Massa debil, Hawkwing!" cried Quaco, leaning over the tafferel, displaying his'white ivory, and looking as happily as if he were already landed on terra-firma; ' look aheah4! you. shootee at Massa Willet, eh? yah, yah'! Hold your hand, and I toss you cuplee bullets, Quaco find in your pistils ' yah,. yah, crackee-,-dis uhile, too much for de dam ole Pirate dat time."       .           , .  U ttering these taunting expressions,Quaco could not resist the temp- tation of letting fly the two bullets, which he hurled with considerable force at the chop-fallen scoundrell, one of which hit him directly in the face, causing him to wince, and mutter terrible curses upon the, head, of the African, who had served him such a trick.   ; "What have you in :those bags?" demanded our hero of O'Brunner, who, our readers will reemeber, accounted: himself equal to; any two Yankees.  Och! yer 'onor will, be afther .'pardhoning a poor wake crathur- that's, meself, yer 'onor-and anither, poor wake miserable divil--that's himsilf, Sam -Simple, my shipmate--who have ben timpted, wuss :nor iver Mither was, to do a dirthy, bit o' work, yer 'onor, for' the devil's own son-that's Hawkwing, whom yer 'onor's onor. have sane fit to cast adhrif, and'be d---dto him.!" .     - After: Barney's lamte apology for himself and shipmate, he opened the bags, and to Willett's great surprise, displayed the precious yellow in- gots, which Hawkwing' had- entrusted to take aboard the boat. Also, a casket of jewels, belonging!to; Fleta, and a packet of papers, bearing Hawkwing's name. "Wretches! you dseerve to be flayed alive!"' said our hero. "Yes, yer honor, but don't put yourself to that trouble, for shure they'll do that same for Barney O'Brunner,' whiniver ,he gits into Puggatory, and that same for my frind, Sam Simple. . So ye'll have your revinge ony way, yer onor." :"Go to the pumps, knaves!" commanded Willett; "and don't you leave them, until I give you my permission."      .. , *: .Blissins on yer 'onor's leniency," ,resumed Barney; "yer a man afther my own heart, may ye live a' thousand -years and niver be dhry for want iv a drap o' whiskay.  Having thus expressed his gratitude, Barney and his friend, took hold of the pumps and 'did good service. Night again set in,and it was one of serene loveliness; the stars twin- kled brightly in their spheres, and the ocean was smooth and, calm as a placid river. The long-boat was gliding on her course towards the Azores, while the Timor with but eleven souls aboard lay quietly upon the sea's unruffled bosom.

M.. brig King fisher. Crptain Dashington. Our Hero in irons. Fleta and the Captain. A Love Scene. 'Fleta vindicates her Honor in a Villain's Blood! WILLETT, who had not enjoyed an hour of uninterrupted repose during the terrible excitement of the last few days, now slept as quietly on the quarter-deck of the Timour, with the gem-studded canopy for a covering, and a coil of rigging for a pillow, as a prince on a couch of down. H had been nerved by the fearful responsibility which he had felt rested solely upon him; but now, despite the precarious situation in which he knew the ship to be in, he cduld intrust the watch to his subordinate, Barington, who had served him faithfully in every peril, with instructions to be aroused at any moment, when the danger apprehended from the leak drew near. The night passed away without any material change in the condition of the ship, and the sun arose in majestic splendor from out the illimita- ble ocean, shedding its cheering rays alike upon the good and the evil. -At about six bells in the morning-watch, a gentle breeze sprang up, and before eight bells it had increased to an eight knot-wind. As it now re- quired more hands to sail the ship than during the comparative calm, the pumps could not be worked so incessantly, and consequently the water in the hold momentarily increased. "We must abandon the ship, I fear," said our hero, on being awakened from the sweet slumber he had enjoyed for several hours, and ascertain- ing the less favorable condition of the vessel; then taking the glass in his hand, he ascended the mizzen rigging and took a careful survey of the horizon in every direction; no sail could he descry-not even a speck was visible on the ocean. "Nothing in sight," said he on coming down; and then musing for a moment, he asked, " how much water in the hold, Mr. Barington V' "Between seven and eight feet," was the reply, "and rising more rapidly each moment; the men are nearly exhausted by great exertion at the pumps." "Lower the jolly-boat-she can't swim for many hours," said Willett, in hurried tones; " have every thing put aboard that can add to our com- fort and safety. Would to Heaven I could save the ship; but she is doomed, and human effort is vain."  With a sigh at the thought of deserting the vessel, our hero went into the cabin to communicate his decision to Fleta and Martha, that they might prepare for the only alternative left them, while he himself gath- ered together the instruments, portable valuables, log-books, the ship's papers, necessary clothing, &amp;c., and ordered Quaco to see that they were carefully stowed in the stern of the boat. In less than an hour everything was in readiness ; the jolly-boat which   TH CRU1SE OF THE CLIPPERS.        23 was quite large and stout, contailed provisions, water, and such articles as were necessary for the perilous voyage. As the wind was light, the mast was stepped, the sail bent and brailed up, and the rudder shipped. The two females were first handed over the gangway into the boat, fol- lowed by Quaco, then the six men, including Barney and Samt until all were aboard excepting our hero, who stood for some minutes on the bul. warks, as if reluctant to leave the first ship he ever had under his corn mand. It was not until he heard the voice of Fleta, in gentle admonition for, tarrying so long, that he cast off the boat and leaped aboard, and took his seat in the stern-sheets beside the angelic girl whom he had sworn to protect. Proceeding to a distance of some twenty fathoms from the ship, the boat hove-to, Willett resolving not to lose sight of the old Timour, until she had sunk beneath the billows. An hour passed away, and she had settled nearly to a level with the deck. For some moments she seemed suspended just upon the surface, as if struggling with the power that was gradually drawing her below. A long roller lifted her ponderous stern, her bows were under, she heeled upon her starboard beam, and rolling nearly keel upwards, she plunged, like a mighty leviathan, far down into the fathomless deep, disturbing the waters for a few moments, and then' all was quiet, leaving our voyagers without a speck upon the illimitable sea to gladden their hearts.  A deep-drawn sigh escaped the lips of our hero, and then, trimming his little sail, the light barque sped lightly over the waters, and her course shaped for the Western Isles. The sun was now at its meridian, and or! taking an observation, it was ascertained that they were only about six degrees of latitude north of these islands, and, notwithstanding their ene- mies in the long-boat had steered in their direction, being by far the near- est land, it was deemed advisable to follow. The wind being southwest, the sheet was close-hauled, enabling them to lay their dourse in the direc- tlon required. The day passed over-night came on with her hosts of glittering stars -no clouds veiled the blue canopy-the ocean was still, and all was serene and beautiful. The fair Fleta was watched over, while she sweetly slept, with all an ardent lover's care, till long past the midnight, then re. signing her to Martha, and the helm to the trusty Barington, he, the gal- lant, noble-hearted sailor, enjoyed somle hours of undisturbed repose. Another morning dawned, bright and beautiful as the preceding. Bar- ington, soon as the sun arose, scanned the horizon long and carefully with the glass, and was about to remove it from his eye, when an expression of joy irradiated his manly features; he looked again, steadily, and surely, and then exclaimed, with a loud exulting cry, which startled the sleepers 'from their slumbers-  "Sail ho! sail- ho!"  "Where away ." ejaculated Willett, aroused from a profound sleep, and rubbing his half-opened eyes. "Where away, Mr. Barington V" "On the weather bow, three points, sir!" Eagerly our hero seized the glass, and gazed long in the direction indi- cated. "Yes, I see it!" said he, with a gladdened heart; "but cannot make her out; one thing is certain, she is bearing northwardly." In the course of anl hour, she was made out to be a brig, coming down with the wind on her qalrter, with every rag of canvas drawing. "She looks' like an armed vessel?" remarked Barington, as the hull loomed up above the horizon. "A French cruiser, perhaps!" "I More like an Englishman," said Willet. "That's not a French rig."    <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6930-00000013"/> 24          THE FLYING YANKEn; OR, "Plaze ver 'onor" said Barney O'Brunner, "let .nesilf who has sailed in His Majesty's sai vice, and knows the cut of ivery bit o' canvas in that same, take a luk through yer 'onor's tiliscope; tis mesilf kin tell that, ony how, as thrue as Saint Patrick was a gintleman like yerself, yer 'onor." Barney was indulged with a look through the glass; for some reason, best known to himself, he didn't care to look long, and returned the glass to Willett, with a troubled look. "Well, Barney, what is she l" "She's an eighteen gun-brig, yer'onor: that's what she is; and her name's the King-fisher, as thrue as my name is Barney; and she's command- ed by Captain Dashington, of the Royal Navy." Our hero, supposing that this information was of the same doubtful character of many other stories which the voluble Irishman had told, took no notice, of it. "Hoist a signal," ordered Willett. The stars and stripes, which were the only bunting taken aboard the yawl, were bent to the halliards and run aloft. Our national ensign made rather a clumsy appearance on that occasion, for it was nearly as. large as the sail itself; but it served their purpose. It was discovered on board of the English cruiser-for such she proved to be-for soon the meteor flag was displayed at the peak, and when within hailing distance of the tiny craft, she hove-to. A voice, through a speaking trumpet, hailed the boat, and after the interchange of a few questions and answers, she was permit- ted to come alongside, and our voyagers were met at the gangway by the commander, who assisted the two females aboard, and gallantly conduct- ed them to. his cabin. The whole party were received on board, together with every article in the boat, of which the purser was ordered to make a schedule of. The vessel, as Barney had said, proved to be His Majesty's brig King- fisher, of eighteen guns, under the command of Captain Dashington, a pom- pous, self-conceited, otherwise good-looking Englishman; and the moment this august personage re-appeared on deck, he ordered Willett and his. party to be put in irons and carried below, without giving a single word of explanation; and, upon our hero's remonstrating against this strange and unjustifiable proceeding, he was commanded to be silent; that he, the commander, had correct information as to who and what they were, and it was his duty to treat them as prisoners. Willett attempted to con- vince Dashington as. to their character, but not a syllable would he listen to, and rudely ordered a guard of marines to hurry the prisoners below as speedily as possible. As our hero was led past a group of sailors, he heard a familiar voice, saying- "That young stripling was the leader of the d--d mutineers!" He turned his head towards the speaker, and to his astonishment his eye encountered the brutal features of Hawkwing, who returned his gaze with a triumphant smile, a smile of malice, of hatred, of revenge! The whole truth was revealed at once-Hawkwing, and his ruffians, had previously been fallen in with and taken aboard the cruiser. The wretch had invented a story, to suit his own purposes, reagarding recent events on board of the Timour; and, instead of representing his own party as the guil- ty one, the innocent had suffered from his lying tongue. This, then, must account for their arrest, thought Willett, and he forthwith determined to demand an interview with the commander of the cruiser, and endeavor to place matters in their true- light before him. Fortunately, the log- book of the ship, in which he had chronicled every circumstance of impor. tance from the time of Captain Fleetwood's. death to the morning of the   'I' E CRUISE OP TIE CLIPPERS.       25 abandonment, was among the effects which had been taken from the boats, and in the purser's charge; he had also about his person a packet of impor- tant papers, which he presumed might throw some light upon the career and character of Hawkwing. He had not examined them, but remain- ed precisely as he had discovered when he took it from the bag containing the ingots.  But there was one thing which, far above all others, troubled our-hero's mind. He liked not the appearance- of Dashington, the commander of the Kingfisher, fromt the moment he first met his eye; and, now that he reflected upon the peculiarities of his physiognomy, he distinctly saw in his mind's eye, the word "libertine" clearly traced upon his features. His imagination consequently conjured up all sorts of diabolical evils that might possibly befall the pure being, who had been rudely separated from him, and placed out of his immediate protection; but, there was one consolation left him-Martha was most probably with Fleta, nor would she easily be separated from her; if with her, he knew she would shield her young companion from harm, even at the sacrifice of her own life. While these thoughts racked his brain, le pencilled' upon a slip of paper an earnest request to the cruiser's commander, to grant an inter- view with him at the earliest possible mpment, intimating that he had a startling revelation to make, which, backed by undeniable testimony, might prevent him from continuing to do a great wrong to the innocent, and let the guilty go unpunished. This note he despatched to Captain Dashington, through the hands of an unfledged middy, who only con- sented to perform the task, when he had received a crown from the pris- oner. This middy was said to be the youngest son of an earl, but the blood of younger sons, we suppose, does not become "noble" until his senior brothers ' pop off." Of this, however, it does not become repub- licans to inquire; yet, we believe in good blood, whether it courses in the veins of a statesman or a street-sweeper-.-a millionaire or a beggar. Instead of receiving, as he confidently anticipated, an early reply to his note, the day and night, and even another day and night, passed away, ere our hero received even the knowledge that his pressing note had reached the august personagf for whom it was intended. At two bells, in the afternoon watch of the third day since Willett's party had been imprisoned aboard of the cruiser, that her con- mander, the valiant Captain Dashington, gave orders to have the chief prisoner, guarded by a file of marines, brought into his august presence.  "This is your writing, I believe ." remarked Captain Dashington,.in- quiringly, holding up the slip of paper, which he had received from the feed reefer but the evening previous, although it had been sent two days earlier, by this scion of " noble blood." "It is," replied our hero. "It is an audacious, and insulting request, under the circumstances," said Dashington, sharply. "I cannot deem it, sir, even in the slightest degree disrespectful, for one who is unjustly put in irons, to ask to be heard in his defence, espe- cially when it seems that the real culprits have had a hearing," replied Willett, with the utmost coolness. "Audacious!" muttered Dashington, between his clenched teeth; and, then, recalling his better temper, he said, pompously, "I have proofs as strong as holy writ against you; but, I will be indulgent-I will hear your version of the story; but, before you begin, let me warn you, that /    <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6930-00000014"/> 26         THig FLYING YANKEE; OR, the least prevarication from the truth, will only make the matter worse- for yourself and for your companions, linked in the affair." is Sir," said Willett, "if you have already prejudged our'party the guilty one, from the testimony you have heard from our enemrnies, my statement will be useless; for well 1 do know that it is not within the bounds of possibility, that you can know the particulars of the disasters which have befallen us from any other source." "Well, well, go on with your story," said Dashington, waving his bhand. "First, sir, I demand to be released from these shackles!" said our hero. "Oh, you do, eh . There is time enough for that when your innocence is established, replied the royal commander." '( I would ask if the innocence of those creatures, whom you picked up in the long-boat, is established?" questioned Willett. "They are your accusers!" replied the naval officer. ": And I am their accuser!" returned our hero, spiritedly; "' I do accuse them of being one of the vilest gang of wretches that ever disgraced a' ship's deck! and before any court of justice in the world I am prepared to substantiate my assertion. If you have that gallantry and nobleness, which are said to characterize the officers of the royal navy, you will not readily detain men, and women too, as prisoners, who have been so un- fortunate as to be thrown into the company of a band of ruthless sea robbers, and who would have murdered us all, had they not proved them- selves poltroons as well as villains." "Bold words, sir," said Dashington, evidently impressed by Willett's words, and manner. "Prithee, of what specific crime do you accuse Captain Hawkwing, late master of the American-ship Timour?" "Of a series of crimes," replied our hero. "First, I do accuse him of secretly murdering Captain Fleetwood, by a subtile poison! Secondly, of an attempt to murder Martha, the stewardess, by the same means. Fourthly, of being the leader in u- conspiracy to seize the ship and trea- sures, and convert her into a Pirate!" "These are enormous charges to mnake against one who claims to be a subject of King George," remarked Dashington. "I can substantiate thenl by the evidence of honest men; not by out- laws, such as you have listened to; also by the testimony of two females, whose words would be received inl any court of justice in the world." 'I can have no such investigation here; yet of this matter, I must learn sufficient as to know how to act in the premises. The guilty par- ties, whoever they are, should be conveyed to England in irons. But, for the present, you shall be placed on an equal footing with your accusers. Mr. Truax," addressing a subordinate, "l you may remove the irons from the prisoner. And snow," turning to the latter, ' you may proceed with your statement." Willett commenced his narrative from the time Captain Fleetwood had first become his protector; his regard for that estimable man; the voyage of the Timour ; her detention at Havre; the final shipment of a w  gang of men, providing Hawkwing, who seemed to be a favorite among then, could have the berth of first mate; the sailing of the ship; hiis meritorious conduct until after Mr. Fleetwood's death and, burial; his villanous conduct subsequent thereto; the circumstances in regard to the poison; the storm, and cowardly conduct of Hawkwing; the various conflicts, and their leaving of the ship in the long-boat, and of Willett's   THE CRUISX OF THE CLIPPERS.        27 own party subsequently abandoning the ship. All these facts were nar- rated in a simple, clear, but forcible manner. Unwillingly as Dashington was to belie ve him, yet the narrative produced an impression upon his mind. "A very plausible story," he remarked; "but I listened to one quite as plausible from Hawkwing, corroborated by every one of his Inetn,  "Did you examine them separately?" queried Willett. "Yes-no--I-that is, I took his testimony, and they unanimously responded, ay," said Dashington, stammeringly. "Yes, it were necessary that they should hang together, or they would surely hang separately, as our countryman, Dr. Franklin, said to the noble band of patriots who signed the American Declaration of Independence," replied Willett, facetiously. "Do you pretend, sir, to tell me that you are an American!" "1 feel proud of that honor, sir." "But you were not born there?"I "Ay, sir, born in that glorious land of liberty."  "Let me tell you, sir, that however true your story may have been, I cannot'believe that you speak the truth, when you declare that you were born in that -semi-civilized country," said Dashington, with contsiderable emphasis. "And let me tell you, sir," replied Willett, sharply, " that you could not taunt me in this manner with impunity, were we differently situ- ated." "Ah! brave words," replied Dashington, sneeringly. "Why, sir, let me ask, did you suppose that I was not an Ameri- can G "Because I am satisfied that you were born and reared in England." "Is there anything in my speech, manners, or action, that stamps me a countryman of yours?   In brief, do I look like an English- manll?" "Precisely, as I hope some day to be an admiral," replied Dashing- ton. "Americans are but a half-civilized race-a compound of renegade- Englishmen, Frenchmen, and savages. Now, to do you justice, your  speech and manners indicate a civilized breeding-quite a gentleman, poll honor, as 1 hope to reach the summit of my desires." "Sii," said Willett, "I canl bear your insults, because I cannot help myself; but, I am sorry I cannot return your sneering compliment, by admitting your knowledge of that people, who gained a glorious indepen- dence, by a succession of splendid victories over the armed myrmidons of the tyrannical Georgo the Third." "Ah! very satirical, very; but a truce to this bandying of words," said the valiant comnmander. "As regards the country of your nativity, I have mv own opinion, and all your eloquence only goes to substantiate, it. None but an Englishman could speak our vernacular so nearly cor- rect. Now, what testimony have you to corroborate the narrative you have given of the scenes enacted on board of the Timour ." "That of the two femnales, five Americans, one African, an Irishman and an Englishman." - "We'll hear the females last; the Americans' testimony we'll dispense With altogether, they having rebelled against their king; the Irishman's version of the afflair we will have first." Upon this decision of Captain Dashington, Barney O'Brunner was sent for and brought into the cabin. His appearance - had undergone a corn-    <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6930-00000015"/> 28 1H FLYING YANKEl: OR, plete metamorphose since he first came on board the cruiser; the long, rick-colored beard and whiskers; which he had always worn; were curtailed; his locks, of the same disagreeable hue, had been shorn; two of his front teeth had also mysteriously disappeared; and to render com- plete the disguise, he had darkened his ruddy, florid complexion with a compound of soot and grease. Even Willett failed to recognize, at the first glance, the Irishman of his crew, and he wondered what object he, could have in view, in thus metamorphosing himself. Barney was well aware that he stood on ticklish ground; he knew that if he told. the truth, Hawkwing and his companions could cause him to be hanged in almost any port of western Europe; if, on the other hand, he told not the truth, Willett would denounce him as one of the conspira- tors. On a moment's reflection, he resolved to act with the party which were strongest, and which he thought had the power to do him the most injury. The fact that his old associates were the accusers, and their anta- gonists were the prisoners, fixed his determination, though he resolved to be a slow and shrewd witness. To the question as to what he knew about the affair, he answered: "By the powers, yer 'onor, 'tis a very long rigmarole, all about most nothing at all, save a bit iv a skrimmage or two, in which' Barney- that's mesilf, yer 'onor-got a whacking thump jist here on my fmetnry origin, and fath, I thinks it'll be a long time afore Barney will be able to remimber wot was said and wot wasn't, and wot- was did and wat was did'nt. Pardhon me, yer 'onor, when I get betther of the cracks on my skull, I can till as strait a sthory as iver ye read oot of the books." "Silence! no more of this blarney!" commanded Dashington; "tell me what you know of this matter." "Wot I know now, or wot I shall be afther knowing when my head is in a ricolicting condition?" asked Barney. "What you know now!" "That's but very little, yer 'onor, if I had now but a small drap 'of whiskay-the dare crathur-I think I could remimber a story worth tilling." "Once more I ask you to go on with your story, and relate what you do know!" commanded Dashington, half angry and half pleased with the Irishman's peculiarities.

"That will do," said Dashington, "remove him to the brig." Barney was marched off to his place of imprisonment by a file of ma. tines.. As soon as, he had gone, Dashington said to our hero,- There, sir, I perceive you are condemned by one whom you relied upon, to fasten the guilt on him whom you have accused." Willett, in reply, was 'compelled to explain the peculiar relation in which Barney and Sam Simple stood towards the innocent party, and re- lated the circumstances. which are already known to the reader. Martha was then called, and corroborated every particular of Willett's narrative. Our hero then referred him to the log of the Timour, which he would find among his effects, and in which he would find noted down every particular of the scenes 'enacted on board of the Timour, from the hour she left Havre, until she foundered. "I'll take another opportunity to examine the log-book, also to take the testimony of the young lady, who is so unfortunate as to be mixed up in this affair. Meanwhile, I shall cause Hawkwing and his gang to be manacled; and, rely upon it, you shall all have justice done you, for I've heard enough to convince me that there's been h-- to pay all round ;" and Dashington pompously waived his hand, as a signal to remove the prisoner from his august presence. Our hero was again compelled to submit to be handcuffed, and led back among his companions, feeling, disgusted with the man who not only disgraced the uniform of his rank but disgraced mankind. After this in- terview, he absolutely' felt less hatred toward Hawkwing than toward the valiant Captain Dashington. The estimate which our hero had formed of thisofficer, was mainly correct; indeed, he had made himself' so notoriously offensive to good society, while ashore, that they discarded him altogether; and his iflu- ential friends, to save him from .utter disgrace; had succeeded in getting him the command of the Kingfisher, a. brig in wihich he had before served as lieutenant, and it is said distinguished himself in an affair at theisland of Corfu, which resulted in the capture of a trabaccolo, and the driving of nine others ashore, by two of the brig's boats, one of which was com. manded by Dashington.-There were conflicting statements in regard to his behavior on that' occasion, but, however, it-served to promote him to a captaincy, and afterwards to the command of the cruiser. As soon as our hero had been ordered back to his ignominious quar. ters, Dashington calledFleta into his presence. Pale:with the effects of the scenes she had undergone, and trembling for the safety of Frank Willett,t she stood before the mai who unjustly:held her noble' protector and lover in custody. "Be seated," said he, arising and endeavoring to take her. by the hand, from whose touch she recoiled with instinctive horror. "Ah, my pretty maiden," said the libertine,in blander tones than he was accustomed to use, "'fear not 'I command here--youshall be treated with all gentleness; be seated, I pray thee." "No," said she, "the poor suppliant'must either stand or kneel before him of whom she would crave a boon." "Speak, gentle creature," said Dashington, gazing upon her charms with feelings of admiration; "f can deny you nothing-a word of per- suasion from those sweet lips i is rresistible-speak but thy wishes."    <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6930-00000016"/> 30         TUBl FLYING YANKBIS; Olt, The blood mantled the cheeks of the fair girl, and her eyes sparkled with indignant fire, She would have replied to this language as it de- served, but Martha had informed her of his ordering her lover to be put in irons, and her only desire was to have him set fiee. "Oh, sir," said she, "if you have any compassion upon an almost broken-hearted orphan, set free my noble, generous protector, my friend, the chosen of my father!"

"But he is charged with the crime of mutiny," returned Dashington; "it were worth the price of my commission to set him free." "You are deceived, sir; Heaven knows he is innocent of any crime. By his gallant spirit, he quelled a mutiny, instead of being himself a mutineer i Oh, sir, he is brave, noble, generous--indeed, hp has so many rare and excellent qualities that he is beloved and honored by all, who know him.

Dashington started to his feet as suddenly as if he had been stung by an adder, and in his confusion, he gave orders for the immediate release -of Willett and his comrades. The officer retired, and the libertine lover recommenced his impious importunities. I have now set your friend, and his companions, at liberty," said he; "now, bright being, what is my recompense .' "My thanks," said she, turning from him, disgusted at his language sad his manners. "And is that all V he asked ;." now by all that's ungrateful, I thought yon would be kind."

"Ah! with my whole heart do I love him! would to Heaven I were more worthy of his devotedness."

"Base man, let go my hand!" said she resolutely: "weak as I arn, there is danger in me." "There is danger, indeed, in those bright eyes, and in'those tempting lips, which I now press to mine!" said he, endeavoring to encircle her waist with his arm, and draw. her towards him. "But there is more danger in this bright steel!" she exclaimed, as sud- denly she clutched a poniard from its sheath, which hung from the mis- creant's belt!-the polished blade flashed for a moment above her head, and then descended upon the wretch ere he had polluted her pure lips! He uttered a frighful yell, staggered back a few paces, and fell to the floor, while blood flowed freely from his heated flesh! Simultaneously, Martha;,several officers, including the surgeon, rushed into the cabin. And what a spectacle there mettheir eyes! There lay the dissolute captain weltering in his gore! and within tiree paces stood the slight, agile form of Fleta, with a bloody dagger in her uplifted hand, looking more like a marble statue than a being of flesh and blood!' "Help! help!" gasped the bleeding corqmander; "I am dying-oh! God, forgive me!" The wretchedjman writhed in agony of mindand body, and uttered many incoherent confessions, while the surgeon was probing and dressing his wounds--for it appeared that the poniard, in its quick descent, cut a fright- fu! gash in his left cheek, and entered his breast just below his shoulder blade-but when he informed him that his wounds were by no means dan- gerous, he left off his ravings, and instead of accusing himself as he had done, he accused Fleta of being an assassin!-that she attempted to mur- derhim without the slightest provocation! But fortunately, his own officers, who not only knew the character of their commander, but had heard him justify the maiden's qonduct when he was under an apprehension that he was dying, did not believe him. During the latter part of this scene, Willett, having been released from his fetters, and being apprised that the captain had been stabbed by a woman, had entered the cabin. The moment that Fleta saw him, she gave a loud scream of joy, and rushed into his arms. Dashington, for a moment disregarding his wounds, and noticing the fond embrace with a feeling of bitter jealousy, angrily ordered them to be separated,' and that Willett be again put in irons! There was a brief struggle--a few shrieks and a clash of weapons- our hero was overpowered, and the unjustifiable mandate of the wounded officer executed! CHAPTER V.

But how changed in appearance was the vain, haughty and self- conceited officer. Ten days had seemed to add ten years to his age: his face was pale and haggard-his lofty, proud step had lost its elasticity- his heavy, commanding voice had become enfeebled; and the dishonor- able scar upon his cheek so disfigured his face, that, whatever pretension he had as to its being a handsome countenance, its comeliness was gone -gone forever!-that scar, received at the hands of an insulted, indig- unat maiden, he would carry to his grave! All the surgeon's skill had been exerted to no effect in erasing that shameful mark! He had healed the wound but not effaced it. The day previous to that on which Dashington'crawled on deck, he ordered the servant to bring him a small mirror, which hung in the cabin. He took it in his hand, and beheld, for the first time sinice his confinement below, the reflection of his mutilated, sunken visage. He recoiled with horror at the ghastly, hideous spectacle it presented! and, dashing the glass into a thousand fragments upon the floor, he exclaimed with a fierce bitterness, which he had not hitherto exhibited,- "By all the fiends of h--l! I am a ruined man! The scar is more frightful than was the fresh, bleeding wound! Surgeon!" he continued, calling that officer to his side: " could not all your boasted skill leave me in a less hideous plight than this?" "I have used my best efforts," was the reply; "the cut was a deep one, and the blood was far from being in a healthy state." "Think you time will not efface that terrible mark?" "Never!" "Then, by the infernal powers, there is but one thing left for me to accomplish," said Dashington, with demoniac fierceness. "Revenge! ah, revenge! that will I have! deep damning, yet sweet revenge, to com- pensate mie for this ineffaceable, everlasting mark of disgrace!" The surgeon, disgusted with his patient's absurd outhreak of passion, left him to his own thoughts. 'To accomplish that which he had sworn to, was the enfeebled wretch's studied purpose. The idea of revenge, a sweet, but blasting revenge, took entire possession of his guilty soul! Ay, the means were already in his power, and he would only wait the most fitting opportunity to carry his hell-conceived designs into eftect. The Kingfisher at length dropped anchor in the harbor of Portsmouth. It was a dark, misty, gloomy evening when she arrived.--Hardly was she moored, when Dashington directed his six-oared barge to be manned, and then informed Fleta that she was to go ashore in the boat. Feeling that she could not possibly be in a worse condition ashore, she and Martha hastily prepared for disembarking. When all was in readiness, Fleta and her kind friend appeared at the gang-way. "You may remain aboard until morning!" said Captain Dashington, addressing Martha. "No," said she, firmly; "whither Miss Fleetwood goes, there will I go; and when she goes, then will I go. It is her desire and my duty;" and she stepped into the barge with her interesting companion clinging to her. "'Neither will I go without her," said the young maiden deter- minedly. Dashington bit his lip with anger; but he saw their inflexible resolve,   THE- CRUISE OF THE CLIPPERS. 'B   M m . Se. ,8. -'...--.

There were in the: barge, besides those already noted, six oarsmen, the coxswain, and a midshipman, a sort of protege, a creature of Dashington, who never scrupled to do any thing, however dirty and contemptible, that his superior desired him to do. With these the boat put off for the shore, and on arriving at the dock, and the'excise officer being satisfied as to the character of the party, a cabrhole' was called, into which Martha and Fl ea were placed, accom- panied by Captain Dashington, and Midshipman Ratsey. A drve through several narrow streets brought them to an inn, with a chalky-looking painting of a Mermaid for a sign. Here the vehicle stopped, and the two females were assisted to. alight, ushered into the house, and politely conducted by a servant of their own sex up one flight of stairs, and into a large chamber, furnished with old-fashioped gilded furniture.'" "The captain he's a wery nice man*' said the woman; " he halways paternizes 'The Mermaid,' he duz; and he horders the wey best wittles and drinks, yes, ladies;- and atween you and I, he whispered in my hear to give you the best hapartment in the 'ou e d, h, he 's sich a duck of a man, he is; honly, sumhow or muther he's not so 'andsum as he es,  i't--i specf he's fit a gyeat battle, tkkee a 'ole fleet o' prizes, 'as got a mifnt o' mwo., tlnd vill get promoted to be a H!admiral; he vill.

"We ned nothing at present," said Marthat disgusted with the woman's volubility and exceedingly coarse manners, and she felt thankful when the door was no longer darkened by her presence. "Alas! my dear Fleta," resumed Martha; "I can hardly imagine the character of the place to which we have been brought; but let us take courage and put a bold and a bright face upon the matter. Here, at all events, are two inviting beds, on which we may indulge in a good night s repose, after having beon deprived of such a luxury so long. First, we will make all secure, and then retire. To morrow, let us hope and pray, may bring forth somethinga to relieve our minds from the horrible uncer. tainties, M to what are, the brutal captain's intentions towards us, and to- wards our friends." ' The faithful companion of Fleta set about examining the fastenings of the old-fashioned casements, and that of the entering door of the apart- ment, and turning the key upon the inside, she deemed all safe for the night. Leaving a taper unextinguished, they both sought their pillows, and offering a prayer for their deliverance from the state of suspense in which they were placed, they soon sank into a sweet sleep. While this was transpiring Dashington, with his creature, Ratsey, were holding an interview, in the coflee room, with a rough, portly, red-nosed Englishman, and a woman, with an equal rubicund nose, and quite as rude and portly in dimensions. On the conclusion of the conference, which was carried on in low tones, Dashington said to the woman, as he placed a purse in her hand,- "There are twenty golden likenesses of our king to bind the bargain. See that it be done to-night, and if successful, in accordance with my   THE CRUISE OF THE CLIPPERS.        35 instructions, forty pounds in addition shall be your reward. In the course of four or five days I shall be enabled to rejoin you and relieve you of your charge." There was a joyful acquiescence to the libertine captain's proposition, and after indulging in a double " bottom" of hot brandy all round, for the third time, Dashington and Ratsey, jumped into a cab at the door, and riding down to the dock where the barge was in waiting, were taken aboard the brig. One hour after midnight, there was a stifled shriek heard in the apart- ment, occupied by Fleta and Martha! The latter, aroused from a deep slumber, found the room totally dark! She cled out to Fleta. There was no response ,! All was still, save a rustling noise, apparently proceed- ing from the adjoining room. She arose quickly, and feeling her way in the intense darkness to Fleta's bed, discovered to her horror and amaze. ment that she was gone! Whither gone I by what possible means? were queries that caused her very soulfto quake with the worst apprehensions. She groped about the room, and encountered nothing but articlesof furni- niture. She examined- the door-it was secure as she had left it; the window fastenings, too, had not been disturbed ; there was no other door, except that which led into a closet;. in this. closet there appeared to be nothing but wearing apparel, hung upon hooks!"Oh, God! what can be the meaning of this awful mystery " she ejaculated in tremulous tones. Just at this moment, the quick tread of horses, and the rumbling of wheels over the pavement, indicated that a carriage had hastily departed from the inn! The thought suddenly flashed across her brain that Fleta was in that vehicle!-that, by some secret way, her abductors had obtained ingress to and egress from the room! In her moments of despair she ran to the door, determined to alarm the house. She turned the key, but the door it was impossible to open! It was, in fact, barred and bolted upon the outside. She screamed aloud-and when the-echo of her own voice died away, all was still as death! Again, and again her shrill cries broke the solemn stillness, but there was no response! Despairingly, she threw herself upon the bed. and wept aloud! Two hours of intense agony passed slowly by, and a faint glimmer of grey light through the casement indicated the dawning of day. The suffering girl arose and took another survey of the apartment, in which she now deemed herself a prisoner. There was the bed, in a disordered state, but not Fleta ; her clothes, too, were gone. She then examined every crack and crevice of the floor and ceiling, the fire-plaee and the flue leading therefrom, the closet and its drawers, and every movable and immovable thing in the whole apart- rten%, but not a sign of any secret place of egress, that could be made by a human being, could be discovered. The casements were all barri- caded with round bars of iron, making it impossible for any one to enter or leave the room through them, and the key and bolt of the lock remain. ing precisely as she had left them before retiring, shrouded the whole matter in an impenetrable mystery. The taper that was burning when they fell asleep had evidently be i blown out by human breath, for the oil in the cup in which the tnr(tW  ,atcd was not half consumed. Finding that no clue could he eotairlc' . the dread mystery, Martha strove to compose her agitated ftelil,' Nhe dreased herself, and sitting down in an arm. chair by the ce ,it, she resolved to wait calmly for coming events, without makt..g y fiurther demnonstrations. In the course nffan hour she heard footsteps at the door, and the ro- moving of bars, and then a rap fell upon her ear. She arose and turned the key, and on opening the door, there stood the woman, who had shown    <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6930-00000019"/> 36          THE FLYING YANKEE; OR,  them up stairs on the evening previous, bearing a waiter contairing food. "Ere's yer breakfast, Miss Vot's-yer-name," said the servant; "I vos in 'opes to 'ave fetched yer a chop, but the chops is all heat up, they is, and so is the 'am and the heggs,but I saved you hout a 'Armouth' erring, a real bloater, I did." "Tell me, woman," said Martha, as soon as she had entered the cham- ber, and deposited the waiter upon a table, " what is the meaning of this mystery? why am I imprisoned here? and above all, where is the young lady who accompanied me here last night?" "'Ow should 1 know? You must hask them vet knows," was the reply. "Stay," said Martha, seizing her by the arm, "I am a desperate woman -if you know anything concerning what has happened in this house dur- ing the past night, tell me-instantly tell me." "I knows nothing," persisted thewoman; "'ow should I, I vatit to know, ven I duzn't sleep 'ere I vaits 'ere in the day an' hevening, then I goes helsevhere to sleep I duz." "Where is your master-conduct me to him!" commanded Martha. "Mistress, yer mean-the Mermaid hisn't kept by a landlord-but by Mistress Minthlossom, and she's hout, she his." "And who has the charge in her absence?" queried Martha. "Vel, there be Miss 'Arriet, Harabella, and Harraminta Minthlossom,Y and the rest of the young ladies," replied the woman-"If yer vish to speak to them, yer'll find 'em heating breakfast in the coffee-room." "Then I suppose I may consider myself no longer a prisoner?" "Oh no, marm-ve never keeps 'em hover night, ve don't." "Pray, tell me, what is the character of this house?" "It's a Hinn, it his." "Has it the reputation of being respectable?" "Oh wery, wery-ve'as the best custom in the town, ve' as." Desiring to question the apparently simple woman, Martha, without deigning to partake of a single mouthful of the food which had been brought to her, followed the serving-woman down stairs, and into the coffee-roonm, where sat some six or eight females, who were seated at small tables in different parts of the room, laughing and chatting and evidently enjoying their breakfast. Although it was the morning meal, they were attired in dresses of bright colors, of a flashy vulgar fashion, with tawdry jewelry in their ears, on their bare necks and arms and on their fingers; and, on the whole, bearing themselves in a flaunting, abandoned style. They were all quite young and beautiful, but there was that in their features, which showed that their beauty had begun, prematurely, to decay. Into the presence of this, to her, strange company, Martha was ushered, and made enquiries, in the most earnest manner, concerning Fleta, and of the cause of the outrageous treatment she had received. "Thank your ugly face that you are now permitted to go free, and be d--d to you," answered the eldest Minthlossom. "Could you boast of being decent-looking. you would not go away so easily." Whether this remark of one of the Minthlossoms was regarded as a good joke or not, we will not venture to give an opinion, but they certain- ly laughed and shouted as if it were the best of the season. After they had ceased laughing, Martha demanded again to know the meaning of what had happened, but they shook their heads and professed entire ignorance; then, with tears in her eyes, she beseeched them to tell her of the fate of the poor orphan child who had been placed under her protection. She then related their misfortunes, the trials they had gone   THE CRUISE 0' THS CLIP-PER .        37 through, with the hope of exeiting in their bosoms a spark of sympathy for the unfortunate of their own sex. It was a huriliating duty, but'she knew not on what abject wretches she had wasted her words; they were once women, it was true, but they had long since lost all claim to that honored title. They responded to her simple narrative with scoffs and jeers-the more touching, the more they scoffed; to her enquiries, they returned rib- aid and lewd expressions; to her prayerful entreaties, sneers and curses; to her threats, bullying expressions, such as women, and rarely men, per- mit to escape from their lips; and, finally, on being accused of being a mad woman, a confirmed lunatic, and being threatened with personal vio- lence, she left the den of infamy, trusting that Fleto, however miserable, was not within its accursed walls. But whither should she bend her footsteps? To whom should she ap- ply for redressing the great wrong which had been committed . She was in the fatherland, it was true; but there was no sympathy there for the rebellious Americans; she was in a strange town, without a friend, or an acquaintance-alone and unprotected, without even the means of pro- curing a mouthful of bread. She had not breakfasted, but she felt re- joiced that she had rejected food in that den of harlots. She wandered from street to street, and finally reached the docks; and on enquiring as to the whereabouts of the Kingfisher, she was told, that her prisoners had been landed, her crew discharged, and the vessel had dropped down the harbor; but as to where the prisoners were confined, she got as many con- tradictory answers as there were prisons in the shire. Night came on, and the wandering stranger, faint with fatigue and hun- ger, applied for food and shelter at the doors of several respectable appear- ing residences, but in each instance she was rudely repulsed, either by un- kind words, or having the door slammed in her face. Completely exhaust. ed, she sank upon the pavement. Many there were who passed her un- heedingly by, thinking that it was only the frequent recurrence of a fe- male's beiing intoxicated, At length a respectable looking man, though wearing the garb of a sailor, happened to stumble upon her. 'He raised her from the earth, and finding that she was lying prostrate for the lack of food and the need of rest, he supported her tottering steps towards his own humble residence, but a few rods distant. After partaking of food and becoming refreshed, she told her pitiful story, which so enlisted the feel- ings of the benevolent man, who proved to be a harbor pilot, that he re- solved to 'exert himself in her behalf. But for the present we must. leave them for the purpose of looking up other prominent characters al- ready introduced to the reader. On the morning subsequent to the arrival of the Kingfisher at the Ports. mouth station, the men in irons were all taken ashore, and arraigned before a sort of Admiralty court, where a brief investigation was had, which re- sulted, (on what grounds of evidence or by what perversion (of justice we know not,) in sending all of Willett's party to one receiving ship, and Hawkwing's party to another,both hulks lying within three cables length of each other. Our hero in behalf of his companions, as well as himself, protested against this violation of the rights of Americans; but the only reply or satisfaction to be obtained was, in substance, that His Majesty s service needed sailors, and they might feel thankful, that the mutihous charges against them had been waived; furthermore that till undoubted evidence was adduced that they were not subjects of Great Britain, they must remain in the service until their term of impressment should expire. This was one among the many outrageous cases of impressment on the -    <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6930-00000020"/> 38     .     THE tPLT'FYNO YANEE ; OR, part of England which was made known to the Government of the United States. War was anticipated-British vessels had already been prohibi- ted from entering the ports of the United States; His Majesty's sloop-of- war Moselle had fired upon the U. S. brig Vixen off the Bahamas; the American frigate President had captured the English ship Little Belt, to retaliate for the outrage done some time previously by the British ship- of-war Leopard, 50 guns, on the United States frigate Chesapeake, of 36 guns; four British barges were captured in Hampton Roads. Besides these and other retaliatory events, on both sides, prior to the war, English cruisers did not scruple to overhaul and search vessels sailing under the stars and stripes, and impress American seamen with impunity, which more than any class of events, justified the young republic in afterwards inflicting upon its unnatural mother a blow which is yet quite green in the proud old dame's memory. But we are ranging ahead of our story. Willett and his companions had been on board of the receiving ship some six weeks, when he resolved, even at the jeopardy of his life, to make a desperate attempt to escape. He communicated his design to Barington, who at once determined to brave the perils of escape with him. The plan was to swim ashore, a distance of nearly half a mile in the night time; this being accomplished, they would then determine as to the best course to pursue to leave the country, and if possible reach the United States, where the story of their wrongs would arouse their countrymen to avenge them. Such was the hatred of Great Britain towards the United Stales at that time, they knew it were worse than useless to seek for Fleta, and Martha-of whose fate they knew nothing-or to seek favor either among officials or the people. Our hero and his trusty companion chose a gloomy, foggy night for their bold attempt. While eight bells were pealing the midnight-hour, and the relief marine guards were going the rounds, they emerged from one of the lower port-holes of the three-decked hulk, and by means of a rope, quietly slipped down into the water. They were both excellent swimmers, and so noiselessly did they glide away from the -huge hulk, that the sentinels heard not even a suspicious sound. The flooding of the tide favored their progress, and they reached the shore in safety, each with a small parcel of clothing, which they had fastened upon their persons. After resting for nearly an hour upon the water's bank, they were startled by the rolling of a drum, of which, although distant, they understood the import. Their escape had been discovered, and the drum was beating to muster the men on the deck of the prison whence they had escaped. With hurried steps they struck off into the open country, and after walk- ing some three miles, they came to a grove, where, upon a bed of dry leaves, they slept until a late hour in the morning. In this place of com- parative concealment they would have remained until the succeeding night, were it not that hunger drove them forth into the kirig's highway. Reaching a small inn, they entered, and having refreshed themselves with a substantial English breakfast, they paid their reckoning, and departed. Having reached a section of country, then but sparsely populated, and while congratulating each other upon the success of their hazardous under- taking thus far, their hopes were suddenly dashed, by the appearance of a troop of mounted soldiers, coming on at full gallop towards them. Our hero and his companion, without a moment's time for consultation, dashed off with all possible speed, Willett towards a high, rocky bluff which overlooked the sea, and Barington towards a thicket, but a few rods distant. Onward came the pursuers, (for such they were,) and first perceiving Barington, they made a dash for the thicket, leaping fences, and   THE CRUISs OF THE CLIPPERS.        39 ditches in the hot pursuit, and before he could find a place of concealment he was discovered and retaken. Meanwhile our hero was seen making for the bluff, and onward rode a detachment of the troop to securethilu; but he had resolved that he would not be taken alive. On, gaining the highest point of the bluff which projected over the water, he saw a small schooner-rigged craft, lying at anchor, at a distance of nearly three'fourths of a mile. From her appearance he judged that she was not an English vessel. At all events he had no time for scrutinizing the craft, or discuss- ing her character in his own mind, for the Philistines were nearly upon himr. His resolve was taken-they should not be his captors-he would go where they dare not follow! He scarcely suffered himself to look upon the dashing waves which'beat upon the rugged rocks beneath; but, cast- ing off his light garments, he turned for a moment upon his pursuers, and waving his cap triumphantly above his head, he took the perilous leap! The horsemen reached the spot whereon a moment or two before stood the hunted fugitive, and deeming that no human being could cast himself from that spot into the sea and live, they were about to retrace their steps, when one of them, with a loud exclamation of surprise, pointed to the waves beneath, now being breasted by our hero, who was striking off fearlessly for the schooner. The soldiers discharged both their carbines and pistols at the deserter, but the bullets fell harmlessly around him, anld he was soon beyond their range. The astonished pursuers tarried long enough upon the summit of the rock to see their intended victim reach the vessel's side, and mount her deck in triumph. The captive, Barington, cried with joy, when he was told how his noble commander had escaped; he was carried back to Portsmouth almost a willing prisoner, so gratified was he that his friend was no longer in the clutches of the British lion. The troop, with their single prisoner, gallopped quickly back to town, and related the marvellous adventure of the deserter's escape, filling every body with wonder and astonishment; and, notwithstanding he had escaped from His Majesty's service, many there were among the people, who rejoiced that so -brave a fellow had escaped, and sincerely hoped that he might not be retaken. But among naval officers and men, Willett's dar- ing feats only created a greater desire for his recapture, and they deter- mined that it should be effected at every hazard. Accordingly a fast-sail- ing cruizer was immediately despatched to overhaul the strange schooner, without regard to any ensign she might display, and take by force, if ne- cessary, the bold deserter. In this they had no. great difficulty, for the craft proved to be a Dutch galliot, commanded by a fat, beer-drinking Dutchman, who was stupid with schnapps and beer when Willett first appeared denuded before him, and swore he was "der tuyful ;" when he had sobered himself, however, our hero, by signs, tried to explain to him how it occurred that he was on board of the galliot in such a plight. The Dutchman, finally willing to believe that he was some shipwrecked sea- man, and no relation to the gentleman who keeps up such a hot fire for the roasting of sinners, gave him a pair of his meal-bag trousers,.and a jacket'of formidable dimensions, wherewith to cover his nakedness; and to appease his hunger, set before him the usual edibles that a Dutch skip- per of that day was accustomed to luxuriate over. A bunk was then  assigned to our hero to take a siesta in, but before indulging in such a luxury, he made an attempt to persuade the skipper to sailforthwith to the coast of France, and to land him at any port which he might find most convenient;. but as the one could not speak English, and the other could not sprachen Dentscher, Willett gave up the atteilpt, and endeavored to *                                <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6930-00000021"/> reconcile himself with the idea of being landed at Amsterdaml providing the slow-sailing craft was not brought-to by a shot from one of Johnny Buli's barkers. And, as the reader may readily infer, the galliot was easily overhauled by the cruiser sent out in quest of her; and so overjoyed were the Eng- lishmen to discover the object of their search, snugly stowed away, and fast asleep, in the bunk of a Dutchman's dingy, smoky cabin, that they permitted the galliot to pursue her way, without doing any violence to either captain or vessel, for the sin of harboring a fugitive, which, in the eyes of Britons, at that day, was a most heinous offence, and one which they usually punished severely, regardless of the rights and laws of nations. If there is any one thing which excites more than another the admira- tion of Englishmen, in men, it is in the performance of great physical feats-such as require herculean strength, extraordinary activity, great personal daring, skillful manoeuvring, &amp;c., and as the performances of their recaptured deserter, were, in their eyes, almost miraculous, he was really a 4' nine days' wonder," among the crews of vessels of the fleet there stationed; he was regarded as quite a hero; and, what was most remarkable, he received no punishment for that which the regulations of the service regard as one of the highest of crimes. . Instead of being placed again on board of the receiving ship, he was drafted on board of the frigate MACEDONIAN, a perfectly new vessel, built entirely of English oak, and then regarded as the finest ship of her class, in all respects, belonging to the British service. Captain Carden, who had heard the tale of Willett's daring adventure, did all in his power to reconcile him to his situation, and even offered to promote him to the berth of gunner's mate; but he steadily refused all favors that were offered him; and when a month's pay was tendered him by the purser, he dash d the paltry pieces of Brit- ish silver to the deck, as if there were contamlination in their very touch. He, however, obeyed each and every order that was given him, took his watches on deck and below, and performed the usual routine of seamen's duties as did his shipmates. But oh! what agony of mind did he inces. santly endure on account of Fleta. Not a syllable had he learned regard- ing her since he heard that she was conveyed ashore, on the evening of their arrival in Portsmouth. in company with Martha. It was a little relief, however, to his mind, to know that the last intelligence he had of them, they were together. He would have sunk in total despair, had the information of what had occurred on that dreadful night of the "Mer- maid" reached his ear. It was Hope that still buoyed him up; and to avenge her wrongs, he would live, and, if need be, endure any amount of suffering. On the 18th day of June, 1812, war was declared against Great Brit- ain by the United States of America. Some thirty days afterwards, news of the declaration reached the mother country, creating a sensation through- out the United Kingdom, but more especially among the officers and crews of His Britannic Majesty's fleets! They marvelled at the reckless audacity of Brother Jonathan, in placing himself in an antagonistic posi- tion to the armies and navy of Great Britain, renowned for their brilliant achievements over the most warlike nations of Europe. Prize money to be earned from the d-d Yankees, was the theme among the tars and marines of the wooden walls of Old England. The Atlantic Ocean was to be their great El Dorado; they manifested the utmost impatience for orders to sail, flushed with the idea that the picking up of Yankee mer- chantmen, laden with valuable cargoes, would be but a daily pastime;   THE CRUISE OP THE CLIPPERS,        41 and as for Yankee men-o'-war, and Yankee Privateersmen, they had but to pour a broadside into them, and down the starry ensign would come upon the run. Sneers and jeers at our apology for a navy, and boasts of their kingly master's formidable fleets, both by officers and men, and echoed amrong the people, were the general topics; indeed, scarcely any- thing was talked 6f, or thought of, afloat or ashore, but the imbecility of the d-d Yankees-easy victories-prize money-lots of fiolics, fun, etc. No where was this confident braggadocio spirit manifested in a greater degree than on board of their model frigate, the Macedoniau, officered and manned mostly by men who had had the experience of many a stoutly contested battle; and of course their invincibility was the daily and hourly topic dinned into the ears of Frank Willett; he heard all without a single retort; he was moody and silent, but his heart thrilled with joy, when he learned that the government of his country would no longer submit to degradation and insult with impunity, and when the Macedonian's sails were swelled by the breeze, he shouted as loudly as the exulting tars and marines of John Bull. He 'had a presentiment that they would soon dance to another tune; that a day"of chastisement and retribution was at hand. At all events, he would meet the faces of some of his countrymen once more, and as for being forced to fight against them, that was a mat- ter most remote from his thoughts. The proud Macedonian was at length on the billows of the broad At- lantic; her sailing qualities were proyed to be admirable; her crew were underithe best of discipline; they exercised at the guns daily, and could handle her eighteen pounders as easily as if they had been so many swivels. Never was a British vessel better prepared to cope with an enemy than the frigate Macedonian; and, from the commander down to the powder-monkey, all were confident of the most complete success, with the exception of one, who in his heart, doubted the ultimate realization of the more than hopes of these vaunting subjects of King George the IV.

ON the morning of the 25th of October, 1812, in latitude 29; longitude 29 W., there was an unusual commotion on board of the English frigate Macedonian, caused by hearing from mast-head, the talismanle-siout of.-- "Sail ho! sail ho!" "Where away!" demanded the officer of the deck. "On the lee-beam, sir,' was the answer of the look-out. "What does she look like"         ,   -  "A ship-a large ship, sir-I think she's a Yankee merchantman." "A prize, by St. George " exclaimed the lieutenant, with a hueckles addressing a young reefer who stood beside him; and bringing his glass to his eye he scanned the horizon in the direction indicated, and espyed the object reported from aloft. "If it be a Yankee merchantman," he continued, "she has either not discovered us, or is in a fair way of falling into the lion's jaw. She hugs the wind closely as if she would like to get a nearer view of us. Here, Jasper, (giving the middy the glass) get aloft, and see whether it be a craft of belligerent Jonathan, or one of our    <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6930-00000022"/> 42         THE FLYING YANKEE; OR, own gallant ships. I am afraid after all it is the latter, and if so, we are doomed to another day of mock play at the guns." The middy took the glass, leaped into the Ilizzen rigging, and ascended to the cross-trees, where he remained sonme time in endeavoring to make out the distant stranger. Meanwhile, the Macedonian bore away a point or two, so as to ap- proximate nearer to the sail, but not enough, however, to allow the latter to get the weather-gage of the fiigate ; for, should the stranger turn out to be a man-o'-war of the enemy, the sailing-master could choose his own distance to engage her, while he held this position. Since the Macedonian had left port she had not overhauled a single vessel that did not either hoist the British ensign, or the ensign of some friendly power. The " old salts," were constantly complaining of their ill luck, and the officers were impatient to meet some Yankee frigate, that they might show to the world additional proof that the assumption --"Britannia rules the wave," was no gasconade, but rightly belonged to her, and she was abundantly powerful to maintain it. The sight, there- fore, of a supposed craft of the enemy animated their spirits, and created quite a bustle and curiosity on deck. "'Well, Jasper," said the lieutenant, while the middy was descending the lower rigging, " what do you make of her?" "A Yankee, sir-- know by the cut of her t'-gallant sails, and her slender spars." "Did you see anything that looks like teeth?"  "The swell is so heavy, it is yet quite impossible to make her out," replied the midshipman; "she's a good sailer, and hugs the wind as if she would like to come up and speak us." "'Or fight us," muttered the lieutenant to himself, as he turned on his heel. "It's all the same, if she's a Yankee; his Majesty's frigate Mace- donian is more than a match for any vessel afloat, manned by the strong- est of his enemies." The lieutenant, after giving an order to the man at the helm, took another survey of the vessel at leeward. Her hull had loomed up con- siderably, and he was now enabled to judge of her character. "Jasper!" he cried. "' Ay, ay, sir." "Go, below," continued the lieutenant, "and rouse up Captain Carden. Tell him there's a large ship to leeward; and add, if you choose, that it is my opinion she's a Yankee frigate." The young reefer touched his cap and disappeared into the cabin, and in a few moments re-appeared, followed soon after by the commander, Captain Carden, whose well known gallantry was acknowledged by both friend and foe, and who was held in as high estimation by his own coun- trymen as any officer in his majesty's service. "A sail, sir," said the lieutenant, saluting his commander. "She looks- like an armed ship." - The captain took the glass, and one glance at the stranger convinced him as to her character. "By the shade of Admiral Blake, we are in for a fight to day!" he exclaimed with animation. "That's an American frigate, or I'm no Englishman! We have already one advantage of her-we're well to windward." The Macedonian, with the wind one or two points forward of the beam was riding over the billows at the rate of eight knots; while'the leeward. craft hugged the wind closely, and yet kept her relative position abeam. Orders were now given to clear the decks for action; the drums beat to   THE CRUISE OF TO E OLIpPS. RS. .. quarters, the ports were opened, guns runs out, :shot and cartridges handed up, marines stationed, ;and everything prepared with almost clock-work like precision, waiting for the expected conflict. As the two frigates neared each other, it became the opinion of the British commander,- and coincided in :by his lieutenants, that the stranger was the frigate Essex, which had captured the Alert, a sloop-of-war, some two-months previous; and as Captain Carden had a description of that frigate's armament, he resolved to engage her at a long distance. ' Up with the ensign!" ordered the captain, as soon as he had judged he had got within long gun range. A roll of bunting was run up to the mizzen flag, and as it rolled out upon the breeze, displaying the blood-red cross of old England, three hearty cheers went up from the. crew, and a shot from the shifting gun was, sent towards the stranger, which fell slightly short of its mark. In another minute, the starry ensign of the American Union wits waving proudly above the quarter-deck of John Bull's bold antagonist: three cheers were faintly heard inithe distance, but no gun was fired, no shot was wasted. A smile of proud defiance was visible on. Captain Carden's features, when he saw the flag of his presumptuous enemy floating as proudly as that under which he stood, and which had " braved the battles of a thousand years." "Boys!" cried he, addressing his men; ".there are thirteen stars on that flag; every one of which was stolen fi'om the British crown b,. rebels and traitors. We have under us the best built, the best armed, and 1 believe the best manned frigate in all His Majesty's fleets! and to you is entrusted not only her safety, but the honor of the meteor flag which waves above you! Your king, your country, your own honor, .demand' your best energies to-day! Let your cry be, St. George and merry England!" A loud response, which made the- welkin ring, went up at the conclu- sion of this sentence. "I give you thirty minutes, boys," he resumed, " to bathe in Yankee blood, yonder flag of the wretched, imbecile, .presuming power, that dar- ingly imakes war with us!" Of course this raised another shout; and as the' Yankee' was now within range of their long guns, they commenced firing briskly, doing no other damage to their antagonist than occasionally sending a: shot through her sails, cutting her rigging, &amp;c. No shot was yet returned; the Yankee fiigate was slowly crawling to windward, while it was now 'Captain Garde's object ,to keep iher. just within reach of his shot,and .he gave orders for hauling a point or two more closely to the wind for that purpose. He determined ,o ,cripple the enemy, -and do him all the damage possible at a long range, and then bear away,pounce down upon himn, and mke an easy victory! eSone of the old tars, who had often smelt the powder of an enemy, commented rather freely upon this state of things. "I say, Bill," said an old gunner to his messmate, " what d'ye think4 I'd do, s'posein I -was in. the old,man's toggery, jest now,?" "You'd be hunlder that fellow's battery, ,ald let 'ira blow,us sky-'igh." "I'm blow'd if I wouldn't, and be d---d to him!"' replied the old gunner, 1" afore I'd be sneakin)g off hee eat this distance, and playin' this ere silly game of long bowls! iDidin't the old man,., when, reeling off that fine speech, give just thirty minutes, tobring down that striped bit o' buntinl!' "'Arf an 'our, to a second." "Ay, that he did," resumed the,vpteran.; " mayhap he'll keep his word; but if he does, may I never light another match! I tell ye, it's uapossi. ble. Jf miy old commander, Capt. Talbot, was in Capten. Cardens lplace, he'd bear down on that Yankee, .as the Victorious, seventy-four did ,op    <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6930-00000023"/> "         THS FLYING YANKEE; OR, the Rivoli seventy-four, last February. Why, we took the Frenchman in about forty minutes, and lost only twenty-seven men, while we sent to the sharks four hundred Johnny Crapeaus." The order to fire was again given. The old gunner applied the match, and then resumed his somewhat free comments: "There now, goes another of his majesty's eighteen pound shot on a fool's errand, and I'll wager my next ration of grog, the d---d Yankee's laughing at us to see how we're tossing the cold iron into the sea." "I wonder why the henemy don't return our fire ." remarked Bill. "Depend hon't, he's frightened, and hintends to let us take 'im without blazing at us at hall, and hit is the wisest thing he can do, seeing as 'ow he's sure to be hour prize." "Shake my olk hulk, now, if I think it's best to be sartin," continued the veteran. "Mayhap we've been underrating the Yankees too much. "Now, I begin to think that that frigate knows pretty well what she's about; and if we don't find it a tough job to get that flying gridiron down, then set me down for a land-lubber-for one who has never heard the music of iron hail flying about his top-lights. You see, Bill, she don't flinch a hair, but. is hugging up to her w'ork. I should like her better if she'd only be perlite enough to send us one of her largest balls, so that we can know something of the metal of her war-dogs." No sooner had the old gunner expressed his wish, than a roll of smoke issued out of one of the ports of the American frigate,. and a shot came richocheting over the waves and finally buried itself, with well-nigh spent force, into the side of the Macedonian, just beneath her lower port-holes! "Blazes!" exclaimed the old tar; " whoever saw the likes o' that, Bill? Just as if that chap heard what I wanted, and then was perlite enough to accommodate me.  I isn't superstitious, Bill, but shiver my old tim- ber if that ain't a forerunner of summat worser to come." During this conversation, the Macedonian kept peppering away at the enemy, sometimes a whole broadside, and then with an occasional gun, and but one shot had been returned. Steadily and majestically the silent enemy persevered- in her endeavors to close with the noisy Englishman, and just as obstinately did the latter strive to keep at a long range distance, without absolutely appearing to avoid the engage- ment. Nearly an hour had passed away in this over-discreet mode of fighting on the part of the Macedonian; yet each moment brought the two frigates more closely together. At length the American began fir ing an occasional shot which " told" either in the hull or rigging of the enemy; and one heavy shot carried the-topmast by the board. The Macedonian, no longer being able to keep at a convenient distance, was obliged to come into action, within reach of grape and cannister. At this crisis of the engagement, an incident occurred, in which our impressed hero performed a conspicuous part. Just before the conflict began to rage furiously, Willett, who was stationed at one of the upper deck guns, just abaft the main-mast,-stepped up to Captain Carden, and touching his cap, said:-  "Pardon me, sir, I have a request, to make--" "No time for requests now," said'the commander, in a hurried man- ner; " when the battle is over, and the victory won----" "It will then be too late," added our hero. "Here, quarter-master," said Carden, calling that officer. "Ay, sir." "See what this man wants--I dare say he wishes to entrust some love token to your keeping, for the mistress of his heart," said the com- mander, as he turned away.   THE CRUISE OF THE CLIPPERS.        45 "WWell, sir, what do you want'?" demanded the quarter-master, in a harsh tone and rough manner. "Sir, I am an American,"' said Willett, boldly. "I have no heart to fight against my own countrymen!" "You d----d mutinous rascal! take your station at the gun!" corn- manded the quarter-master, angrily. "Let me not hear another-cursed word about your heart, you skulking coward! We want your hands, not your heart, nor your d--d gizzard, neither!" Willett seemed to hesitate, as if cogitating in his own mind whether it was best to obey, or rebel and suffer the consequences. "Boatswain," cried the profane, brutish quarter-master, "give this white-livered, would-be Yankee a taste of the cat!" The boatswain struck him thrice, but he winced not under the brutal infliction. "How like you that, you d---d son of a gun?" ejaculated the quarter- master. "That is but a taste of what you'll get, if you don't do your duty with a will. If you are afraid of the smell of gunpowder, I s'pose you know what your duty is '" "Yes, sir, I do know my duty, and I'll do it with a will!" said Wil- lett, with peculiar emphasis, as he turned and took his station at the gun. It was part of his duty- to attend to the priming of the piece, and to pierce the cartridge. Instead of using the implement for that purpose, when preparing for another' discharge, he rammed a rat-tail file into the vent, and broke it off close to the metal.-There was so much smoke and confusion in the immediate vicinity, that the performance of that which he conceived to be his duty under the circumstances escaped en- tirely the observation of even those who stood about him, The piece was carefully depressed, the order was given to fire, anrid he who held the lighted match, wavedfit above his head, and placed it upon the vent. ' There was a flash of the priming, but no report! The gunner's mate ex- amined the vent, and, to his utter amazement, hesaw that the piece was spiked! He turned and gazed for a moment in Willett's eye, and then upon the disabled piece. "By all the gods of war! what mischief's here!" he exclaimed. "Who has had the consummate villany to spike this gun?-Who's the traitor? Wretch, is it you V" and he again fastened -his penetrating eye upon Willett, who stood firm as a granite statue before him, without deign- ing to reply, but his eye flashed with indignation and utter contempt. The quarter-master and his satellite, the boatswain, were on the spot in in a moment.-The former was satisfied at a glance as .to who was the author of the mischief, and he, too, turned his eye upon the supposed per- petrator, who met his searching look with resolute firmness,-- "Sir, I have obeyed your orders!" "Iell's blazes! did I not order you to return to-your duty?" de- manded the quarter-master, whose face was livid with rage. "And I have done my duty!" returned our hero; " my duty to my country! Ay, served mny country, instead of your kingly master!" The astonished quarter-master was so choked with choler that, for some minutes, he could not give utterance to a single word; while the boat- swain stood off at a good striking distance, drawing the strands of the cat- o'-nine tails through his hand, and itching to receive an order to try its utmost effect upon the rebellious sailor's back. Is Hound of hell!" at length fiercely growled'the quarter-master; "what! spike a gun while in action t whoever heard of such an enormous outrage! Curses be upon you! You shall dangle at the end of a rope,    <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6930-00000024"/> 40          THB PLYING YANKEE ; OR, without prayers for the salvation of your miserable soul, and the eternal fires of hell shall be your portion! Throw aside' your back-tormentor, boatswain; we want no such child's punishment as the cat inflicts 'for so hellish a piece of mischief!" Finishing this profane threat, the quarter-master approached Captain Carden, who was watching the progress of the engagement, and issuing such orders as he deemed necessary to ensure a complete victory over his Yankee adversary. "Hang the wretch up to the fore-yard arm immediately!" 'ordered the excited commander. "The fore-topmast has gone by the board, sir, and the fore-yard with it!" suggested the quarter-master. "The imain-yard still holds its place, thank Godj eh'." "Ay, ay, sir." "Well, let him dangle from the main-yard arm awhile; it will be but doing justice to the traitorous fool!" said Carden. "Ay, sir; it's a humane sentence;" said the quarter-master; "hang- ing's much too good for such a villain-he ought to be drawn and quartered!" and with a chuckle, the fiend returned to the spot where our hero was yet standing, with folded arms and an undaunted look. "Boatswain!" continued the brutal quarter-master, " we've a nice bit of a job. Get a rope airound the fool's neck, and run him up to the main-yard arm! Ha, ha, ha! instantly, boatswain-don't give him time to mutter any long prayers! What a glorious example, for all future. time, to men who turn traitors il\ an hour like this! Up with hintm! quick, boys! and then we'll put a prize crew aboard this d-----d Yankee frigate before it's time to give his carcass to the sharks, which are already nosing about the ship."  The boatswain had already a tackle of strong seizing-rope rove to a block at the larboard end of the main-yard, and making a slip-noose, he, threw it over the head, and drew it about the neck of their intended victim. "Seize hold here, a couple of you!" ordered the boatswain. Two sailors stepped forward to execute the order. "All ready, quarter-master," intimated the boatswain. "Then send him to hell!" was the wicked man's unfeeling reply. "Bowse away!" cried the boatswain. Ere the rope was made taut, Willett had drawn a pistol from his pocket, and, taking quick aim at the quarter-master, he fired, and the wretched officer fell to the deck!--The ball had reached his heart, and he expired without a groan! The men allowed the rope to relax in their hands, amazed at the doomed culprit's signal revenge! It was but for a moment; the boatswain again shouted- "Bowse away!" Quickly was the executioner's rope again made taut, and our hero was hoisted from his feet! fand in another moment would have been run chock up to the block! but Fate had ordered otherwise. Just as his feet no longer touched the deck, and he was fairly swinging by the neck, a thundering broadside of round, chain, grape and cannister shot, from the enemy's ship, which had now succeeded in getting within range of- her entire battery, was poured in upon the Macedonian's upper-deck and top- hamper, with most terrible and deadly effect! Down came the main-top- mast and main-yard with a crash-thirty men lay dead and wounded, and among the former were the two sailors, who were ordered to run the rebellious Willett up to the yard-arm! They were horribly cut up by a chain-shot, while the boatswain's head had been shot .from the body by a    THE CRUISE OF THE CLIPPERS.         47 cannon-ball, and crushed to atoms! Poor Willett, half bung, with the cord, though loosened, about his neck, also fell to the deck, and now was lying buried beneath tattered sails, bits of rope, splinters, and other light rubbish! Affailrs began to look somewhat desperate aboard the proud Mace- donian; and it was some minutes before the guns,'on the spar-deck, could be brought to bear upon the enemy, whose every shot, even' from the musketry of the marines, was now having a telling effect, upon every part of the ship. The men fought as bravely as ever British sailors fought, but some of them began to think that the "cursed Yankees" had vastly more pluck than they had been taught to believe. The nizzen- mast, close to the deck, now went by the board, rendering the hulk total- ly unmanageable, while the American frigate, which had lost no spar save the mizzen top-gallant mast, quickly gained a raking position, and a few broadsides from her starboard battery terminated the engagement, and the proud flag of Old England, tattered and tornl, and stained with the blood of her quarter-deck officers, was lying among the slain and wounded of that once proud and formidable frigate! The British lion once more succumbed to the American eagle! Three deafening shouts of Victory, fi'om the erew of the gallant American, fell upon the ears of the vanquished, teaching thernm how idle were their boastings, and that Britannia, powerful as she was, could not rightly claim sovereignty over the seas!  The band of the victors struck up Yankee Doodle; and measures were immediately taken for examining their prize, and if found in a fit condi- tion to put a prize crew on board of her, and send her into the nearest American port.   A detachment of men were sent on boalrd of the Macedonian to assist in taking care of the wounded.

His eye, too, fell upon strangers, yet he knew them to be his own countrymen, and that they had won the battle. 'Victory! victory! huzza!" shouted Willett, as loudly as his enfeebled condition would permit. "Hello!" said a Yankee sailor, who stood six foot in his stockings, "here's a chap that don't consider himself licked yet! Get up here, and let's have it out-I don't see as how you've got any new button-holes in your jacket or trowsers-only a little skeared, I guess, hey 8" "The Macedonian's then fallen," said Willett, with enthusiasm, "in spite of all their boastings, into the hands of--" "The American frigate, United States, and be darned to you," said the Yankee tar, finishing the sentence. "What commander?" "Why, Colmmodore Decatur, to be sure; he's true grit, and if any of ou Johnny Bulls run athwart his hawse, you may expect thunder and liglhtling, and a plenty of just such hailstones as these;" and the tar picked up an eighteen pound shot and threw it into a locker. "Huzza! huzza!" shouted our hero, unable to restrain his feelings, and getting once more upon his feet. '. W hat in the name of common sense are you huzzaing about?" eja- culated the toll sailor. "Hain't I just told you, that your ship is now our property-our prize, hey? and of course every one of you chaps are our prisoners of war! Oh, I see-ypu're a leetle cracked above the top- lights, hey? Pity-coz you're a fine-looking fellow, you are, I swow- but I'm sorry to find you in such darn'd poor company-if you are really now, a subject for a mad-house, I reckon, we'll take good care on you, considering you don't belong on our side of the herring pond." "Give me your hand, my noble fellow," said Willett; "you do not appear to understand why 1 should rejoice at your victory. It is my country's victory, for I am, as well as yourself, a true-born American!" "Rammers and sponges! do tell?-then, how on airth came you here t" queried the other, whose curiosity had become considerably ex- cited. "Impressed,"' replied our hero. "Do tell --shells and mortars! then you are one o' them chaps that we've gone to war about, are you? I've hearn tell about impressed sail- ors, but I never expected to see one, 'specially a live one. That's the reason, I s'pose, you've got that lanyard about your neck, eh? Tie you up, do they! and make you fight agin your own country, the sharks." Without waiting for replies to the tall Yankee's queries, he called Lieutenant Allen to see a 'live impressed seaman, with a rope, around his ueck. "What is the trouble?" asked that officer, as he approached. "No trouble, sir," replied the sailor; "only here's the best-looking man i can find aboard the prize, and he sticks to it that he's an American, an impressed seaman; and I rayther guess he's not shamming, coz, you see, he's got the rope around his neck now." "I am," commenced our hero, addressing Lieutenant Allen, "as you have just heard, an American; that I was forcibly impressed on board of this vessel is also true; but this rope was put about my neck to run me up to the yard-arm, and not tie me up to my duty. Thanks to a well-' directed broadside, at the moment I was hoisted from my feet, which not   THE CRUISE OF TIE CLIiPPERS. A   O-DST-- - O-E "O B'ERT'--[ .

There lies the lieutenant who gave the command to hang me, whom I shot after the noose was put about my neck, and there lie the two men, who were bowsing me up, still clutching a piece of the rope which was to take away my life." "But why did they mean to make you suffer an ignominious death " enquired Lieut. Allen. "Because of what they deemed treason," replied Willett, "but what I regarded as my duty under the circumstances." "What where the circumstances!" "I applied to Captain Garden to be excused from fighting against my own countrymen; he turned my request over to the quarter-Inaster, an intemperate, brutal and profane man. He ordered me, with a threat to take the station previously assigned me at the gun; I hesitated, and received an infliction from the 'cat' at the hands of the boatswain. Stung with mortification at the cruel treatment received, and being threat- ened with severer punishment, if I did not 'do my duty with a will,' I took my position at that gun, on the starboard side, (pointing to the piece,) and, watching a favorable opportunity, I inserted a round file into the vent, broke it off short, thus disabling it from future use." "In other words, you spiked the gun V" "I did." "It was a bold act!" "I knew it." "Were you aware of the consequences ." "I weighed the matter fully in my mind, and expected to suffer death." "And yet, under the circumstances, it was a commendable, as well as daring act!" "I deemed it so." "And so will-your countrymen, and so will our gallant captain!" said Allen, enthusiastically, and taking our hero's hand in his own manly grasp, he shook it heartily, with an energetic will, as if he loved the young man for his courage, in doing that, which nine hundred and ninety-nine out of a thousand men would not-have dared to do, while an ignominious death was staring them in the face as a penalty. The gallant lieutenant examined the gun, and finding the statement of the young man verified, he took him by the arm, led him on board of the United States, introduced him to Decatur, and, in presence of the late commander of the Macedonian, told him of the critical position in which he was placed. Decatur listened to the brief tale with surprise and ad- miration, and looked towards Carden with an enquiring gaze, as if he would be pleased tohear a verification from his lips. The British officer admitted that the youth was impressed into his majesty's service; related all he knew of the facts in the case; of his wonderful escape from the receiving hulk, his recapture, and his subse- quent unexceptionable behavior on board of the Macedonian, up to the hour of the engagement; also, of the request being made to excuse' him from active duty during the battle, and of the reference of the matter to the quarter-master; but farther than this, he denied all knowledge of, and participation in, any matter relating to the young man, after the, reference alluded to. On summing up the killed and wounded, of the glorious engagement, between the United States and Macedonian, it was ascertained that the   THE CRtJIsE OF THE CLIPPERS.        51 British loss was thirty-six killed, and sixty-eight wounded. The Ameri- can loss was trifling in comparison, having only four killed and seven wounded. The injury done to the frigate United States was trifling, while the Macedonian's hull was much cut up, and her top-hamper almost wholly destroyed, showing, clearly, the superior skill of the Americans in the' science of gunnery. Decatur would have continued the cruise, but his prize being in a shattered condition, and the ocean swarmed with the enemy's cruisers, he thought it prudent to convoy her home, which he did in triumph, although he had to traverse a wide extent of ocean. Arriving at the port of New York, there was, of course, great joy and exultation among the people. Every tar :was considered a hero, and their com- mander regarded as the hero of heroes i Decatur, as may be inferred from the generous impulses of his nature, took great interest in Frank Willett, who narrated to him the strange events which had befallen him from the day of his sailing from Havre, in the Timour, to' the hour they first met. That part which related to Fleta, called forth many expressions of sympathy from the gallant commodore;  and on Willett's entrusting to him the details of a plan which he had formed for his future action, they met his hearty approval, and he pro- mised to assist him not only to the extent of his influence, but pecuniarily if necessary. The latter, fortunately, was not wanted. Our hero had wealthy friends, and so had Fleta, who placed at his disposal all that was needed for his contemplated enterprise. The result was, that, in fourteen days after his arrival into port, he was in command of one of the fleetest, most beautifully modelled, and best appointed armed schooners that was afloat during the war. She carried ten brass guns, '1 pounders, one pivot gun of heavy calibre, and two swivels on her quarter deck, and she had a complement of one hundred and five picked men-Americans, every soul of them, from the captain down to the cook's mates and powder-monkeys. She was built at Balti- more, and no vessel better deserved the name of clipper. She was conm- manded by CAPTAIN FRANK WILLETT, and her name was "THE FLYING YANKEE!" CHAPTFR VII.

FLYING over the foam-crested billows of the broad, boisterous Atlantic, in the early part of the year 1813, in lat. 40, N., Ion. 47, W., might have been seen a long; low, dashing-looking schooner, of about one hundred and sixty tons' burthen, pierced for ten guns, and carrying just forward of her foremast, a gun of formidable calibre and length, mounted on a pivot. The craft was painted a jet black, relieved only by a carved and gilded figulre-head, and her. name in gilt letters on the tafferel. With her raking, tapering masts, her slender yards, her nicely-fitting sails, she was altogether as trig and as saucy a looking craft as ever carried a crew of pilivateersmen. She was closely hauled to the freshy-blowing breeze, skimming over the ridged and rolling surface, under mainsail,    <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6930-00000027"/> 52          THE FLYING YANKEE; OR, foresail, staysail, jib, topsail, top-gallant sail, and gaft topsail. Indeed, every inch of canvas that would draw was set and trimmed tautly, not- withstanding it seemed almost reckless to carry such a cloud of canvas, mu the wind, while blowing a spanking breeze. The lohg, slender top- masts bent with the pressure, and at times the bold cruiser would bury her lee ports beneath the foamy waters. At a distance of some five miles, a large merchant ship, also under a cloud of canvas, though not so imprudent as to carry royals, was endea- voring to avoid any nearer proximity to the suspicious-looking schooner, which had been dogging in her wake, in full pursuit, for several hours. The ship was a fast sailer, but evidently no match for the schooner. She had, during the chase, tried her sailing qualities before the wind and on the wind, abeamr and on the quarter, but whichever way she shaped her course, the distance between her and the chase perceptibly diminished. She was now like her pursuer, shaping her course as near the eye of the wind as the squareness of her rig would admit. The schooner, as our readers have already probably surmised, was the letter-of-marque, registered "THE FLYING YANKEE!" eight or nine days out of the port of Baltimore. "She's on the wrong tack now, Frank, that's certain, to succeed in escaping us." This remark was made by the first lieutenant of the Privateer, Charles Fleetwood, a nephew of Captain Fleetwood, and therefore cousin to Fleta. It was addressed to our hero, now commander Willett, just as he appeared upon deck, after having figured up the result of his meridian observations. "Yes, Charley," replied our hero to the familiar remark of his first officer. "I perceive the distance is lessened considerably since I went below. If she attempts to change her course again, she'll certainly get within range of 'Miss Nancy,' as our first gunner insists calling the bow-chaser." "She's good grit," remarked Fleetwood; "see-up goes her main royal." "And there it goes again like a kite to leeward, yard, mast and all," said Willett, who stood observing the stranger's motions through the glass. "Yes-and I've been almost trembling here for the last half hour, ex- pecting to see some of our own top-hamper go by the board," remarked the lieutenant; " those lofty sticks bend like reeds." "Fear not, Charley; every spar of this schooner I have examined closely; they are made of tough wood, and will bend like whalebone before they will break." "Have you observed with what anxiety the men turn their eyes aloft?" asked Fleetwood; " they evidently have not been accustomed to seeing canvas carried after this fashion." "Then we'll accustom them to it before our cruise is over, if old Boreas will blow his pipes hard enough," replied the gallant captain. "Yes, Clarley, it is politic .to show them the utmost we can do. They must be taught, firstly, confidence in our gallant little vessel, and se- condly, confidence in their commander. I wish to impress them with the idea, that, whatever orders they receive from the quarter-deck- however daring or reckless they may seem to be-they will prove to be the most judicious that can be given, and therefore must be obeyed, even at the imminent peril of their lives. Men inured to such discipline are really less in danger than the hesitating and irresolute. Once worked   THE CRUISE OP THE CLIPPERS.         s up to the right spirit, with these staunch timbers beneath us, and this armament, we can carry our craft through almost every danger; and then we needn't show our heels to anything less than a thirty-two gun frigate " "But, tell us, Frank, don't you think that t'-gallant-sail, and gaft-top- sail a little imprudent to carry while close-hauled, in a wind like this?" "Ordinarily, Charley, I should scarcely dare to carry anything but our lower sails;, but, you will soon be assured, that the Flying Yankee is no ordinary craft; there is but one other afloat that will vie with her in any respect except size, and she is a twin-vessel. Their keels were laid and their hulls were launched on the same day, built and rigged from the same scale-draft, under the same superintendence, and for the same owners." And what has become of the other twin?" asked Fleetwood. "She sailed on a cruise five months ago, and has never been heard from," answered Willett. "It is feared that she has fallen into the hands of some of the British cruisers of superior force. If such has been her fate, I would give the value of a first class prize to meet her, manned by a hundred and five of Johnny Bull's best men." "Such may be our good or our evil fortune," remarked Fleetwood. "I tell you candidly, Frank, and that without -boasting-for 1 despise boasters-I should not fear to cope with her, manned by as many Eng- lishmen as could work on board of her, and commanded by the most gallant officer of the whole British Navy. I have observed and know sufficient of English valor and English seamanship, to satifsy me that they would make a sorry show with a regular Baltimore clipper, in a fight or a chase, against one of the same class. manned by Americans. Ten to one, if they have succeeded in capturing her, they'll chop her nose off, raise her bulwarks, straighten her masts, and fashion her so as to more nearly resemble a French lugger, than one of the finest specimens of naval architecture that ever careened over Neptune's domain. The fact is, Baltimore clippers are a little wet in a fresh wind, as we are now experiencing, and Englishmen hate a wet deck as much as they hate a dry dinner; and they also profess such an inveterate hatred to everything of American origin, I wonder that they do not apply the torch to every prize that falls into their hands." "Ah! they are too fond of pounds, shillings and pence for that," replied Fleetwood. "We Yankees, have the reputation of being the most penurious people on the face of the earth, but I honestly believe John Bull beats us in that respect." During this conversation, the ship, which had been looming up larger and larger each moblent, had changed her course by wearing away several points to the northward and eastward. ' Ease off main and fore sheets! port your heltn!-steady! Now, the braces--ease off the lee braces! haul on the weather braces! belay!" These and similar orders were hurriedly given and executed with the utmost promptness, and the little craft wore away as gracefully as a bird, and again went racing ovbr the waves more speedily than ever in a N E. direction, with the wind a little abaft the beam. The log was thrown, and it was ascertained they were making over twelve knots, which in those days was deemed extraordinary speed, and there was not one keel in a thousand afloat that could make it on any wind, with such a spread of canvas as could be safely carried. A half an hour longer passed away in conversation between the two young and gallant Privateersmen, Willett and Fleetwood; and mean-    <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6930-00000028"/> 54          THE FLYING YANKEE; OR, while the distance between the pursued and pursuer had lessened to about two miles. The speaking and overhauling qualities of "Miss Nancy," was ordered to be tested.. The formidable gun was shotted, the match lighted, and Willett himself depressed the piece. As the huge wooden target mounted a wave, the word "Fire!" was given, and Miss Nancy recoiled and bellowed, and belched forth a sheet of flame and smoke, sending forth its iron messenger towards the merchantman, who was vainly striving to escape. "A good shot!" cried Fleetwood, as he removed the glass from his eye, through which he had watched the effects of the swiftly speeding shot. tHer mizzen topmast topples-there it goes, yard, sail and all. Miss Nancy is more prompt in sending down spars than the nimblest sailor. 'If that shot don't bring her to, we must let her send down the main t'-gallant yard!" But Miss Nancy's services were not required for this purpose. The merchantman, like a discreet and sensible John Bull, began to shorten sail-the main and fore t'gallant 'sails were clewed up-storm-sails--  lowered-courses hauled up, and then she came into the wind, and her fore-topsail laid aback. The Privateer, as she came up, began also to shorten sail; almost simultaneously, topgallant sail, gaft topsail, staysail and jib, and foresail were taken in, and she hove-to under mainsail and topsail, within speak- ing distance of the ship, and at the same time ran up the Yankee ensign to the peak of the mainsail. "Ship ahoy!" hailed the commander of the Privateer through his speaking trumpet. "Halloa!" was the response. "What ship is that '" "The Queen Charlotte, Captain Inglefield." "Where from and whither bound?" "From India, bound to London." "What is your cargo?" "Silks, teas, fancy goods, &amp;c. What schooner is that?" questioned the Englishman. "The American Privateer, Flying Yankee, Commander Willett, on a cruise after everything that sails under the flag of our enemy. You will, therefore, please to honor us with a visit, and do not neglect to bring your manifest."  This polite invitation of our hero was acceded to with a good grace, however unpleasant or offensive it must have been to the captain of the Queen Charlotte. Accompanied by one of his inferior officers, and rowed by six oarsmen, Captain Inglefield soon made his appearance at the gang- way of the schooner. He was a good-natured, hale and hearty-looking Englishmnan, and seemed to put the best face possible upon the disagreea. ble, and as he reasonably supposed, disastrous dilemma in which he found himself. Willett extended to him his hand, and assured him that he regretted being compelled to interrupt him on his passage, but under all the circumstances it was as duty he owed to himself and to his coun- try. "It is the misfortune of war," he remarked, " that we are obliged to molest each other on the high seas." "Ay, it's a fair game at which two can play," said the Englishman with a sigh;-" might, I suppose, makes right, in these warlike times; but I think nations should agree not to interfere with each other's corn- merce; let them fight out their battles with armies. and navies." "My views, precisely; and I only wish your own countrymen would   THE CRUISE OF THE CLIPPERS.       55 set so good an example, instead of molesting our commerce even in times of peace; and it is for this that the two nations now stand in a bel- ligerent attitude towards each other. Even so humble an individual as- myself has a great wrong to avenge, but when 1 strik for vengeance it shall he in the right quarter."  "England, God knows, has too many sins to answer for to your peo- ple," remarked Inglefield to Willett's somewhat spirited remarks. The discussion of this topic was cut short by Willett's inviting his compulsory visitor into the cabin, extended to him its hospitalities, and then proceeded to the business of the interview. "The weak have always to succumb to the strong,"' remarked Captain Inglefield, as he threw down his ship's papers upon the table. . i"Had not my ship been a fast sailer, I might now be safe under my snail-paced convoy, and thus avoided this heavy misfortune." "4Your cargo I judge to be an exceedingly valuable one," said Willett, running his eye over the rich list. "Ay; the more luck to you," sighed out the Englishman. "It is extremely valuable," continued our hero, as his eye rested upon an item describing a large amount of gold and silver. "Oh, you've made your fortune, sir, in overhauling me," said the Brit- ish captain, quite resignedly; "my ship is quite an ocean El Dorado, and it' you succeed in avoiding the King's cruisers, and get her once snugly into port, you and your ship's crew, may lay up for the rest of your lives." "Have you any gunpowder aboard?" queried Willett. "Not a cask." "Brimstone?" "Not a pound." ' Saltpetre 8" "Not an ounce." "Any munitions of war?" "Not even a gun or a rammer. Ah! yes, I have a pair of beautiful hair-triggers; and after I have, blown my briails out with one of them, you may consider the pair yours!" "I trust, sir," replied Willett, " that you will do no such fo(olish thing; you will bear your misfortune with more philosophy, when you reflect upon it." "Reflect upon it!" repeated the other ;--" that's just what will drive me to it." "Have you any property aboard contraband of war i" asked Willett, resuming his enquiries. Nothing in the shape of merchandise." "What have you?" "Gold and silver, in ingots and bars, belonging to the British govern- ment." "Of what amount in sterling valued " t Sixty thousand pounds!" "Quite an El Dorado, indeed," said our hero, smilinglyi "and, now, sir, above all, 1 desire you to inform me, that which I cannot ascertain by these papers, whether or not you have among your ship's crew any American seamen"             .  "Not one, I am certain," answered Inglefield; "but if you doubt me in the least I pray you will go aboard and question every man." "Your veracity, Captain Inglefield, after this interview, I cannot ques- 'tion," replied Willett, as he folded up the papers, and placed them in    <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6930-00000029"/> 56          THE FLYING YANKbE; OR, his coat pocket. "If you please, sir, my lieutenant and myself will visit the ship, and make such deposition of her as we may deem advisable." "Before going on board, sir, I have, in behalf of others, a request to make, which I certainly should not presume to do, did I not believe that we had fallen into the hands of a generous foe, and that the circumstan- ces are of a somewhat peculiar nature." "I cal by no means refuse to hear your request." "The case is simply this," resumed Inglefield: "It has been my for- tune, during this voyage, to have the pleasure of the company of three agreeable ladies-a matron and her two daughters; the tirlner is the widow of a distinguished gentleman, who held a high position under the British Government, in India, and who died in that distant land about eighteen months ago. They are now on their return to their native land, after an absence of twelve long years; they carry with them all their wealth, amounting to upwards of seventy thousand pounds sterling, besides other valuables. I will not plead for their wealth; but, sir, I must entreat of you, in the strongest language I can use, to land them at some port in Europe, and not subject them to be carried again afar from Enland, while their bereaved hearts are yearning for their friends and home, Land them but on the shores of France, Spain, or Italy, with all of which nations your own is at peace, and be assured you will never do a better action in the whole course of your life, or one that will call down greater blessings on your head." "In my bitter experience," said our hero, affected to tears, as he recall- ed the treatment his poor Fleta had received at the hands of the country- men of those ladies for whom Inglefield pleaded; " in my bitter experience, I have ever found it vain to plead to Englishmen; think you, that we Americans, whom you haughty Islanders regard as almost savages, can be less stubborn or relentless than ye are? I know of one instance, at least, where American females have utterly failed to excite even the commiseration of your countrymen." "Judge us not all alike," suggested Captain Inglefield. "No, sir; if I did, I should insist that the whole nation deserved hang- ing!" said Willett; " but, touching tfle request you have made, it deserves consideration; for charity's sake we could not do much less; I will go on board your ship, and then you shall hear my decision." Orders were now given to man the six-oared barge of the Privateer; and our gallant hero, with his lieutenant and the captive Englishman, went aboard the prize. They were met at the companion-way by the three lady passengers, who, with tear-dimmed eyes were awaiting, as they supposed, an almost barbarous fate. They had scrutinized very closely the appearance of their captors before the barge had touched the gang- way stairs. The elderly lady declared that they bore no resemblance to any barbarians she had ever seen; Myrtilla, the eldest daughter, thought that neither of the two officers, sitting in the stern-sheets, would disgrace an European ball-room, while Minna, a rosy-cheeked beauty of scarcely seventeen summers, twelve of which had been spent in the Ind, enthusias- tically asseverated that the young officer, with a single epaulette, (refer- ring to Lieutenant Fleetwood,) was about the handsomest man, she ever saw. In fact, instead of half savage creatures, with knives and tomahawks, they were not a little astonished to find in their captors, men with as handsome features, as prepossessing in every particular, as the refined gentlemen with whom they had been in the habit of associating. Captain Inglefield, who deserved to rank with the gentlemen of the old school, took especial pains to introduce the two young Americans to his   THE CRUISE OF THE CLIPPERS.        57 lady-passengers, and while Willett walked over nearly every accessible part of the ship with him, our Privateer lieutenant, with his accustomed gallantry, was striving to make himself agreeable to the trio of ladies, but more especially to Miss Minna, whose laughing eyes, cherry-red lips, and plump, rosy cheeks, had, we apprehend, so much attraction foe him, that his partiality must have been observed. Our hero and Inglefield soon rejoined, the ladies, and in their presence the latter formally surrendered the ship and cargo into the hands of the Privateersmen, and then awaited with trembling anxiety to hear from Willett's lips a reply to the request concerning his lady-passengers, in whom he seemed to feel more than a common interest. "The king's treasures are the first thing to be conveyed on board of the Privateer," said Captain Willett, addressing his lieutenant. The treasures were produced, and Fleetwood superintended the hoist- ing of the boxes in the barge, while his commander stood on- the tafferel, gazing abstractedly into the sea, nor did he stir from this position until his lieutenant infoimed himn that the specie was all on board of the boat. "The king's treasures are something of a prize?" said Willett, with an enquiring gaze, "Worth a dozen ordinary prizqs, replied Fleetwood. "Suppose then, Charley, we should be- magnanimous, and let the: ship pursue her voyage without taking another dollar in value from hwer ." "The suggestion is a noble, a generous one, Frank," replied his friend. "Shall we not be regarded at home as unworthy of Privateersmen, if we let this richly freighted ship continue on her way?" "I think our people are too generous for attaching blame to one who does so noble an act, especially under, the circumstances in which this vessel is placed." "Our crew, too, are interested in this rich prize?" "They are generous as they are brave," ireplied the lieutenant. "Besides, the gold and silver of the king,' that ought to satisfy them."  "My dear friend, your views are mine, and it was for this reason I desired you to accompany me on, this visit to the ship, that you might understand the circunmstances. Rather than inconvenience the lady pas- sengers, or make reprisal of one dollar of their wealth, I'd cut off my sword-hand;. and for Captain Inglefield, he is a kind-hearted gentleman, and merits no wrong at our hand." This conversation was unintentionally overheard by the two sisters, who were seated upon the opposite side of the quarter-deck, and they ran down into the cabin to inform their- mother of that which they had acci- dentally heard.  Meanwhile our hero approached the captain, who stood leaning over the capstan in a disconsolate mood, and thus addressed him - "Captain Inglefield, although my vocation is that of a Privateersman, I have no heart in this business of seizing merchantmen, and plundering them of private property, even in retaliation of similar wrongs inflicted upon our own commerce. Not to seize the treasures of the king, our enemy, would be doing a wrong to our own country. My mission oli the seas is to avenge high-handed private injuries, and to give battle to the king's cruisers; therefore, Captain Inglefield, farewell, and may you never fall into worse hands than American Privateersmen!"    <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6930-00000030"/> S8          THE FLYIKG VANRKEi ; OR, "Sir," said the surprised Englishman, "do I hear aright? am I not laboring under a misapprehension, or to you really intend-" "To allow you to pursue your voyage, with all your freight, except that which belonged to the king," replied Willett, finishing the sentence, as his interlocutor hesitated. "By St. George and the Dragon! this is far beyond ,my hopes!" ex- claimed the delighted captain, taking Willett by the hand, and shaking it as heartily as if he had just discovered in him an old friend. t "Give my compliments to the ladies, captain," said Willett; "and apologise to them for this detention, and the annoyance to which they have been subjected." "The ladies are here to speak for themselves," said Inglefield, as they approached. "I have heard your generous decision," said the matron, s" which I as- sure you is entirely unexpected; accept our heartfelt gratitude, and also this token, as a mark of our esteem for your noble conduct;" and she placed in his hand a small morocco case, which contained a brooch of diamonds. "And allow me to present you this," said Inglefield, placing around Willett's neck a massive gold chain, to which was attached a watch of a hundred pounds' value. The two demoiselles, whose sparkling eyes were now gleaming with a joyous brilliancy beneath their long lashes, on which still hung crystal tears, approached Lieutenant Fleetwood. The eldest, Myrtilla, presented him with a magnificent box inlaid with silver and gold, while the young- est of the two sisters gave him a casket, both of which tokens he was requested not to open until they were on board of the two vessels. Fleetwood received the gifts with as good grace as possible, but he mani- fested some considerable embarrassment, while he met the expressive gaze of the laughing-eyed Minna. It could not have been that he had fallen in love at first sight-oh no, that were impossible-he could not love a daughter of that country which was such an implacable enemy of his own; and yet, he wished she were born under sunnier skies than those of the English Isle-he vowed, in his heart, that she was supremely beautiful, but what was such beauty to him? Nothing-absolutely nothing-so he tried to believe, and for a time succeeded in deluding himself. Ere the final farewell was spoken, Minna extended her hand to Fleet- wood-he took it and it was permitted to be carried to his lips, and ere it was withdrawn, there was an exchange between a sparkling diamond and a pearl of great price. No one perceived the magic interchange- none knew it excepting the gallant privateer luf, and the fair damsel of the Briton's Isle. In another moment he was seated in the barge, beside his commander-a waving of handkerchiefs--a few pulls at the oar-and once more our gallants stood on the quarter-deck of their own incompar- able cruiser. The Flying Yankee's crew were immediately mustered, when Willett informed them that, under all the circumstances, which he would fully explain at another time, it were neither humane nor politic to make a reprisal of the merchantman. There where some slight murmurs of dis- approbation, but when he showed them the king's treasures, which he had taken, amounting to sixty thousand pounds sterling, equivalent to three hundred thousand dollars, they made the welkin ring with their exulting hurrahs, and declared with one loud voice that their commander had acted nobly.   THE CRUISE OF THBE CLIPPERS. ' The two vessels saluted each other by dipping, their ensigns, and then again went bounding over the billows, the Queen Charlotte on a north- east course, while the Flying Yankee hauled up to the southward, for another sail, far to windward, was reported from the mast-head. In less than an hour the Privateer was within long range of the stranger, for both seemed to desire a nearer proximity. She proved to be an eighteen gun-brig, with a heavy armament and a full complement of men. XWith confidence she bowled along directly for the schooner, fired a gun, and ran up the British flag; every thing seemed to indicate that, if the schooner proved an enemy, she desired a close engagement and to. make short work of it. In this respect she found the foe very accommodating. The Privateer quickly returned their single salute, dis- played the bunting of stripes and stars, hugged the wind closely, and as she approached'within a half of a mile, took in her lighter sails, and beat to quarters. Everything was in prime working order on her deck, and every man was in most excellent spirits for a severe conflict, notwith- standing they had more than an equal force to cope with. As the brig neared, the schooner went about and stood on the larboard tack, and crossed the brig's bows-a broadside was fired from the latter, which, in- stead of sweeping the deck, nearly every shot went across her deck, for- ward of her foremast, carrying away' some of the running rigging, and injuring slightly one man, who stood, with lighted match, at the pivot gun. Now was the glorious opportunity for the starboard battery of the American-she luffed slightly into the wind, brought her guns to bear across the enemy's deck in a diagonal direction, and poured in a shower of grape and langrel shot, which stove her bulwarks, tore up her decks, carried away her foremast, and swept away scores of men. The carnage was doubly great, on account of the marines having been ordered to station themselves between'the guns, and as soon as the smoke of their own battery should clear away, to take good aim, and pick off her officers, and as manv men as they could aim at. But, poor fellows! the smoke hung too long in their faces I they had no opportunity to pour in their fatal shower of bullets--not a musket was fired! and more than half of them fell mangled and bleedirg upon the deck! The brig, with the loss of her foremast, was disabled from manceuvring, and of course was now almost at the mercy of the Privateer. Her lar- board guns could not be brought to bear-:there was great confusion as may be imagined, and it was with the greatest difficulty that the officers could rally men enough again to set the starboard battery at work; and when they finally succeeded, the schooner had got to windward of the brig, and now lay athwart her stern on the. starboard tack, ready to rake her decks again; but the British commander, perceiving the advgntage- ous position of his antagonist, though acknowledged to be a brave and excel- lent officer surrendered! Thelwind having lulled since the middle of the day, and a heavy sea no longer rolling, the Privateer ran alongside the armed, prize. Lieutenant Stanhope commanding his Majesty's brig -Fire-Fly, forthwith stepped aboard the victorious vessel and formraally surrendered the brig and delivered up his sword. Then followed a scene which gave more joy to Willett than the marked success of that eventful day. No sooner had the surrender been made, than he saw one of the brig's crew, vainly endeavoring to reach the quarter-deck of the Privateer; he also. heard him declare to those who held him back that he was no Englishman, but on the contrary a full- blooded Yankee. He was so besmeared with burnt powder, blood and dirt, that he was not recognized. The voice, our hero was certain, was    <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6930-00000031"/> 60         THE FLYING YANKEE; OR, not an unfamiliar one, but his brain was so busy with many conflict- ing thoughts, that he could not recall at the moment either the time or place he had heard it. "Let that man come aft!" cried out Wil]ett. The man approached eagerly, for he was going to claim the victorious commander's protection, on the ground that he was an American, im- pressed into the British service, though little did the sailor expect to be made. happy by meeting, in the Yankee captain, a valued friend, who had passed through many fearful adventures with him. The sailor on being brought face to face with our hero, started back with surprise; but in an. other moment our old friend Barington's hand and Willett's were shaking each other with a strong grasp and a hearty good will! A happier meet- ing between two men was scarcely ever witnessed! Barington briefly ex- plained the chain of circumstances which forced him, as his comrade had done, to perform duty in the service of the great enemy of his country. The Privateer lay by the brig until morning, and having no essential damage done to her hull, a prize-master and crew were put aboard of her, and in eighteen days afterward she arrived at the port of Boston, with all her armament, and most of the prisoners who were taken with her. The Flying Yankee continued her cruise, and her commander having learned, through Barington, the cruising ground of a certain other British armed brig, in which he felt a peculiar kind of interest, he determined, if possible, to meet her, and shaped his course accordingly.

KEEP a bright look-out, boys 1" said the commander of the Privateer Flying Yankee, addressing two active lads, who were ordered aloft to relieve two others, who had performed the duty of scanning the horizon for vessels, in their turn. "Remember, the man who first descries a sail is to be promoted to the vacant berth of boatswain's mate." This order was given two days subsequent to the capture of his majes- ty's eighteen-gun brig Fire-Fly, during which period the privateer had been cruising within the same degree of latitude, and nearly within the same degree of longitude. The strictest watch for a sail had been made during all this time, but as yet, notwithstanding they were favored by gentle winds and bright blue skies, not a speck had been seen on the wide expanse of ocean, that resembled the object of their search. At four bells (10 o'clock) in the forenoon watch, the look-out stationed at mast-head, gazed long and steadily at what appeared to be but a couple of small sticks, or two pencil lines-of about one inch in length, on the ex- treme verge of the horizon. Disliking to create unwarrantable hopes, upon the quarter deck, he strained his vision to the utmost, aided by a glass, to make sure that his supposition was correct.   THE CRUISE OF THE CLIPPERS.        61 "Sail, ho! sail, ho!" he at length sang out at the very top of his lungs, and the joyful cry was responded to on deck with cheerful shouts, from hearts suddenly made glad. "Where away '" demanded the privateer Commander, with eagerness. On, the lee-bow, one point to windward," was the answer from aloft. "What does she look like!" "Can't make her' out, sir. She's a two-masted craft; whether schooner, brig, or brigantine, it's impossible to tell-she's at a very great distance, sir." Orders were given and promptly executed to change the schooner's course, so as to bear directly down upon the reported sail. The wind u. blowing moderately, a little abaft the beam, and as all the canvas was drawing full, the beautiful schooner skimmed like a bird with white plumage over the sparkling waters. In the course of a half hour another sail was descried to leeward, nearly in the same direction, but the charac- ter of either could not yet be ascertained. Soon after meridian, the last descried vessel was made out to be a large ship, but whether American or English, no means of judging were yet visible. The other was a square-rigged brig, with either genuine or painted ports. Upon this last vessel, the Privateer commander directed his almost undivided attention, with an anxious and beating heart. There was nothing in her rig or hull to dissipate the hope that fired his breast, yet he would have given up almost anything that he possessed to be certain that the brig in sight was the one he so much desired to meet. "She has changed her course," he remarked to Barington, who stood beside him, equally desirous to know the character of the brig; ' as if she were wishing for a nearer acquaintance with us; that is pretty good evi- dence she is a cruiser, and is not afraid of us." "It is my opinion that's the game we are after,' said the athletic Yan- kee, " and I very much deceive myself, if that ship is not a Yankee mer- chantman, with a prize crew on board from that brig." "Then it will be our duty to recapture her after we have the brig in our possession," said Willett; " but we shall have a tough fight I'm think- ing, if she turn out to be the craft we are in quest of." "And you, captain," added Barington, "will need the services of every man; "and as I. positively decline being considered any longer on the sick-list, I must beg it, as an especial favor, that you will assign me some post where I may not disgrace the character of a Yankee sailor. I feel recruited in spirits and strength; in fact, I could fight half a score of Bulls with a good relish."  "Youishall be gratified to your heart's content," said our hero; " take command of the long gun-it will have work to do, be assured; 1 know you will not let the shot be wasted." "Not I, captain."  "How do you like the post?" "The very one of all others I would have asked for," replied Baring- ton; " and I thank you for so capital a berth. I trust that before the day is over, Miss Nancy and myself will have a loud and favorable report to make." Barington touched his cap, and immediately went forward to look after his formidable charge, and be sure that it was 'put in an easy working condition. "Aloft, there!" cried out the impatient commander "Ay, ay, sir." "What does the smaller craft look like now?"    <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6930-00000032"/> 62         THE FLYING YANKEE; OR, "A large armed brig, sir, carrying t'.gallant sails nearly as large as the top-sails," answered the look-out; " she is working to windward, and the ship is crowding on all sail to get to leeward as fast as possible." "The KINGFISHER! by all my hopes!" exclaimed Willett, while his eyes sparkled with enthusiasm. -Quarter-master, see that eyery rag of canvas is made to draw. These cat's:paws increase my impatience. I am on nettles to exchange signals and shots with my old enemy." The quarter-master ran 'his eye over the canvas, then giving orders to have the sails more neatly trimmed, he directed the man at the helm to use more than ordinary care to keep on a straight course, and not make a zigzag wake behind him. These little attentions to the propelling gear of the Flying Yankee considerably increased her speed, and sHe was now making seven knots, even with the gentle breeze that swelled the sails. Another half hour elapsed, and the brig was in a position nearly equi- distant between the schooner and the ship, the latter scarcely making more than three knots, although she had crowded on all sail, even to her studding-sails. Our observing commander, on a well-known prior occasion, had made himself acquainted with the number and calibre of the guns composing the Kingfisher's batteries; he knew, too, her usual complement ot men, as well as he did that of the vessel which he commanded. He also was confident in the belief that her commander would endeavor to enter into the conflict, if any was had, at short range, and then run alongside, grap- ple, and board. That was the enemy's system of tactics, invariably, when engaging an apparently inferior force, but they were shy and cautious, when they had an equal or superior force to combat. Willett's plan of action, in this instance, he determined should be just the reverse; he knew if he rushed in upon,her as he did upon the Fire-Fly he would not only need- lessly expose his men to the fire of the carronades, but also to a galling fire of musketry from the marines, an unusually large number of which the Kingfisher carried. The Privateersmen at length beat to quarters, and the deck was cleared for a vigorous action. Willett addressed them, and said that they must depend more upon manoeuvring the schooner skilfully than upon the bat- teries for success. The Kingfisher was now on her starboard tack, close-hauled; the Pri- vateer was standing towards her with the wind nearly aft. Soon it was judged that the former was within range of the long gun, and "Miss Nancy," the lady with the loud'voice, opened the ball with a round shot, which went on its errand, curving in the air, and finding a lodging place in the brig's timbers; up to the main-peak was run a ball of bunting, which, gradually unfolding itself to the breeze, displayed to the brig, the stars and stripes of " the land of the free, and the home of the brave." The brig answered these tokens of defiance from one of her heaviest car- ronades, but the shot fell a cable's length short of its mark. The meteor flag was unfolded to the breeze, leaving no doubt as to the brig's char- acter. The Flying Yankee, desiring no nearer proximity to the enemy at present, because of his superiority, hauled up into the wind and stood on. the same tack. Finding that she was forging ahead, the top-gallant-sail was taken in, and the foresail-peak dropped, Which made her sailing qua- lities about equal to that of the cruiser with every rag set and well sheeted home. The pivot gun was now brought to bear upon Johnny Bull, and our tall Yankee tar began to show his bullship some tall specimens of his skill at gunnery. The first shot pierced the brig's hull just below the   THBE CRUISE OF THE CLIPPERS.        3 larboard cat-head; the second crossed nearly amidships, staving in the, bulwarks, and smashing a gun-carriage into a thousand splinters, thereby rendering the piece useless, and wounding several gunners in the imme- diate vicinity; a third shot, a langrel, took a high-flight, and in its whirl- ing descent made an ugly rent in the foretopsail, and severing buntlines, fore-topmast'stay, staysail halliards, and doing other damage; the fourth shot, fired just as the brig was going in stays, traversed the deck from stem to stern, sweeping everything that stood in its course. Meanwhile the brig had kept blazing away with her entire larboard battery, nearly' every shot falling short, and now, having hauled up on the larboard tack, she showed her row of starboard teeth, and began snapping, barking, and growling as before. But she was, fortunately for her antagonist, at too great a distance to bite vpry hard., In "L Miss Nancy" alone lies the only material advantage which the Flying Yankee had over the Kingfisher, and, being enabled to choose her own distance, she severely galled the enemy; so much so, that in time she might have won the victory alone, without the aid of a single broadside. The British commander was thrown into an almost ungovernable rage at the annoying plan of operation adopted by the saucy Yankee; and find- ing, that if it was persisted in much longer, he should be compelled to humble the proud ensign which waved above him to an inferior force; and as for backing out, that was impossible--the Yankee. could sail all round him, and riddle him at her pleasure. He had got to stand his enemy's unparalleled skill at gunnery, without being able to retaliate. He was like a caged lion, completely at the mercy of his keeper. At length a happy thought struck the valiant captain, just as one of Miss Nancy's shots struck the main top-gallant mast, and carried it to leeward. He would adopt a RUSE-not a very honorable one, as his first lieutenant suggested, but one that under the exceedingly critical circumstances was justifiable. It was fair, the captain insisted, to capture' a "d-d, saucy, provoking, cowardly Yankee," by any means. Yes, the idea was a happy one, and it should be put into execution. Down came the British ensign-she had struck! But the larboard bat- tery dvas well shotted-the matches were still lighted-thegunners crouched upon the deck-the marines, with muskets, were ranged under the bulwarks, and everything was prepared to make the "d---d Yankees jump," as the captain expressed it, as soon as they had got them well within the cunning trap set for them. The commander of the Privateer, without reflection, gaveorders to bear away for the Prize. But, it suddenly occurring to him that the brig could not be damaged sufficiently to warrant her commander's ordering her flag to be struck to an -inferior force, resolved to be cautious, and put himself on his guard. He communicated his suspicions-to his officers, and bid them prepare for treachery. The batteries were double-shotted with grape, cannister and langrel-shot-the swivels, too, were brought to bear, and "Miss Nancy" instead of a forty-two pound shot, had crammed into her brazen throat, as miscellaneous and deadly a mass of projectiles as ever was hurled upon an enemy: The matches were lighted, every man was at his post, while the officers watched the brig for the first indication of unfair play. Boldly the Privateer sailed on, as if unsuspecting any foul intention on the part of their antagonist. Our hero, with glass in hand, went aloft, and watched the suspicious appearance of the brig's deck. On the quarter- deck there stood three officers, one man at the wheel, and another man grasping the signal-halliards. The officers stood with drawn swords, and S- , i    <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6930-00000033"/> "         THE FLYING YANKEE; OR, appeared very unlike men who had surrendered. On the main-deck, there were not half a dozen heads visible; and what had become of the crowd of sailors and marines that were there before the flag was struck, was tru- ly quite singular if not mysterious and suspicious. There was also another indication-the smoke of nine matches he counted rising above the ham- mock nettings- a suspicious number, when it is considered that that was the number of guns composing each battery. With these "damning proofs"Willett came from aloft, and took a fa- vorable position on the quarter-deck. He felt that it would be perfectly justifiable if he poured in the murderous fire prepared, without any further evidence that his antagonist intended to play him falsely, yet he could not bear to fire a gun while the flag of his enemy floated not defiantly on the breeze; he liked not to give even the shadow of a reason, for the charge of firing. upon the foe after he had surrendered! The two vessels were now within musket range of each other. Willett's eye was upon the cruiser's commander. He saw him turn upon his. heel and imake a motion with his sword to the man who held the signal-halliards; he then saw him turn again and flourish his sword as if enforcing an order given to men at quarters. Suddenly the deck was alive with men, and the flash of the first gun from her side was the signal for the discharge of one whole battery of the Privateer, deliberately aimed. The treacherous act was committed, and almost simultaneously the belligerents exchanged a mnost terrible fire! and when the smoke cleared away, the meteor flag of England floated again in the breeze-a disgraced ensign--far more dis- graced than if it yet hung over the tafferel, where it rightly belonged! Two of the Privateersmen were killed instantly, and five more were wounded by the accursed duplicity of the Englishmen; the rigging was somewhat cut up, and some other trifling damage done. But, how dearly did the treacherous enemy suffer? The carnage was dreadful! ten, even twenty-fold more than it was aboard the schooner! and to add to the hor- ror and destruction of the scene, a heavy shot struck the foremast within three feet of the deck, and it went by the board, carrying with it a half score of sharp-shooters who were stationed in the top! Affairs began to look rather desperate on board of the cruiser, but they had yet men and armnarrent capable of making a stout resistance. On board of the Privateer there was no confusion; a perfect discipline was acquiesced in rather than enforced. As soon as the smoke of the two broadsides had cleared away, Barington, who had reserved the fire of Miss Nancy to use while the batteries were being reloaded, depressed the piece carefully across the deck of the enemy in a diagonal direction, and applied the match. The variety and quantity of deadly Inissiles which swept across the Kingfisher's deck, from the larboard cat-head to thetafferel, in a diagonal direction, was perfectly awful!-More than a score and a half of men fell before this tornado of iron! The bulwarks were stove, planks ripped up, capstan carried away, besides doing other material dam- age alow and aloft. -Yet for all this, the haughty, obstinate Briton did not strike! He had, confessedly, committed a dastardly act, and to succumb now were indeed worse than an ignominious defeat and death! The carronades kept up an incessant fire, with but little effect, for the schooner changed her posi- tion as circumstances made it necessary, and finally she gained a raking position, and added tremendously to the sanguinary scene on board the ob- stinate enemy. The Kingfisher, no longer being able to bring the carron- ades to bear, the marines were ordered to commence a fire of musketry at every "d--d Yankee" they could get a sight of! These fellows   THE CRUISE OF THE CLIPPERS.    , , exposed themselves to a terrible fire, but without being able to single out a man, because of the dense smoke which, for most of the time since they had been closely engaged, enveloped both vessels! The British flag still floated! notwithstanding they were as severely whipped as ever an Englishman was. Ihe Flying Yankee forged ahead out of the reach of the muskets, then went about on the other tack, and pre- sented, for the first time during the engagement, her larboard battery, with. in pistol-shot of the enemy; A few rapid discharges were poured in, which fairly made the brig look like a wreck; a chance shot cut the signal-hal- liards, and once more the English ensign trailed over the tafferel, but the manner in which it was done was not known aboard the Privateer, because a cloud of smoke veiled the accident. Supposing that the Kingfisher had now struck in good earnest-for there were the most ample reasons for her surrender-the Flying Yankee ran alongside of the brig and threw aboard her grapnels. Fortunately, the Yankee boarders were armed with their pikes and cutlasses for no sooner had the vessels' sides come in contact, than a score dr more of marines, who were ranged across the deck as if in protection of their commander who stood in their rear, were ordered to fire, but ere their pieces could be levelled, the active Privateersmen were among them, and a desperate hand to hand combat ensued, with pikes, bayonets, sabres and pistols. Several of the impetuous Americans were wounded, but their obstinate enemies were overpowered, and now lay bleeding on the deck they had so stoutly defended, either dead or dying! Several of the victorious Americans now rushed towards the treacher- ous commander, intending to run him through with their pikes; but like another son of Mars, our hero leaped between them and their intended victim, turned aside their, pikes, and exclaimed with the voice of a Sten- tor,-  "Stand back!. On your lives, harm him not! He is mine-wholly mine! The valiant Captain Dashington and I have an account to settle! Stand back, lads-fair play!" These words, addressed to his men, in a half-commanding, half-threat- ening manner, caused them to recede, so as -to leave'the quarter-deck wholly in the possession of the two commanders. "Now, Captain Dashington, well met," said Willett, contemptu- ously. "I have surrendered! here is my sword!'" said the bloated officer, taking it by the blade, and extending the hilt towards his captor. "Keep your sword and defend your life " said our hero, indig. nantly. "Quarter!" cried the poltroon. "You do not deserve it. After your. base treachery, which cost me the lives of several of my gallant lads, either one of whom was a better man than yourself, you deserve to be run up to the fore-yard arm, and then to make a meal for some voracious shark. .But I shall give you an opportunity to die less ignominiously, or, if I fall, to save your life.

Even the creeping reptiles of the earth are not so abhorrent or loathsome as you are! Come on, thou marked beast! my revenge makes me impatient to rid mankind of such an inhuman monster!" Tremblingly, the bloated poltroon put himself in an attitude of defence. The allusion to the ugly, prominent scar upon his cheek, nerved his arm a little; but yet he shook like an aspen leaf, more, however, fromsheer cowardice than anger. He fairly quailed beneath the lightning-like glance of his ypung but gallant adversary. Steel finally met steel--but the blades were scarcely crossed, when the disgraced villain's sword dropped from his hand, and he himself fell upon his knees. "Mercy! mercy! oh, spare my life!" he implored in piteous accents, and with outstretched hands. "You, contemptible puppy, implore for mercy?" ejaculated Willett; "you ask for mercy who never knew what mercy was! Gep up, cowardly puppy! take up your sword, and counterfeit a little manliness if you have it not, that I may glut my revenge in an honorable manner. I could not kill a brute in such a cowardly attitude." "Oh, mercy! mercy!" still pleaded Dashington; " let me but live-'tis all I ask--'tis all I can hope for. I confess that. I have foully wronged you. Let me be disgraced-I deserve it; but life-oh, life is dear to the meanest thing that lives." Willett gazed for a few moments upon the humiliating spectacle at his feet; he could not have believed before that man could possibly sink so low; it made hiln ashamed of his own species. The veriest beast could not have so humiliated itself. "Yes, weak wretch," said- our hero, almost in a sad tone; " your life shall be spared; you may live to disgrace humanity a little longer; but upon one condition." "Name it!" exclaimed the prostrate villain, hopefully. "It is, that you shall answer me well and truly every question that I shall put to you." "Upon my honor, I will." "Will you swear, upon your- hopes of salvation in the eternal world, that you will answer me correctly, without equivocation or prevarication, to the best of your knowledge, my questions?" "Most solemnly do I swear," said the dastard, daring to raise his eyes to heaven. "Remember, then, not to let me catch you tripping, for I know much already of the matter I wish farther light upon," said oulr hero, cautioning his submissive 6aptive. "Ifl detect you in telling one untruth, you shall dangle at the fore-yard arm as sure as there's a rope aboard of either ves- se]. Now be extremely careful." "Though my replies criminate, ay, danin me, you shall be correctly answered, as far as my knowledge goes." "Enough! And now in the first place," said Willett, lowering his voice so as not to be heard by those who were standing nearest to him, "tell me what was your motive in the conduct shown to that poor, un- fortunate young female, whom chance threw into your power, on the oc- masion of our first meeting!" "I confess my purpose was a base one," answered the trembling wretch. "She was pure as an angel from heaven, before you saw her. What can you say of her now!" "As pure and as angelic now as then, for aught I know." "What disposition was made of her after- your arrival at Plymouth T"   TItS CRUISE OF THE CLIPPER8.        ot - ' I conveyed her to an inn of bad repute; and, in order to separate her froin her companion called Martha, I caused her to be abducted in the night to the little port of New Haven, near Brighton; a few days after. wards I rejoined her there."

"All her wretchedness, too, is attributable to your misdeeds." -"I confess all -m  sins are great-to, become a better man, and to make amends for the past, I would live. , Spare my life, and however great the hardships and sufferings I may henceforth be compelled to en. dure, no murmurings shall be heard from my lips." "Your life is spared," said our hero, after a few moments' reflection. "Here, boatswain," he resumed, addressing that officer, " put this crea. ture in irons-take him aboard the schooner-stow him away somewhere in the hold, where not even the light of day penetrates to distract his at, tention; he needs an opportunity to repent of his manifold sins; but do him no personal injury." As soon as the famous Captain Dashington was thus disposed of, our Yankee commander ordered the carpenter to examine the condition of the brig's hull below the water line. The latter went below, but soon after returned with the report that she had been pierced with so manyJ shot, it was impossible to plug them; and that, in his opinion, she could not float upwards of two  hours. Our hero then gave orders, first; to remove the wounded Englishmen to the schoonler's cockpit; secondly, to remove all the prisoners; and, lastly, to transfer such of the provisions, arms, ammu. nition, &amp;c., on board of the schooner from the prize, as could be conve- niently got at. While these orders were being executed, Willett and Fleetwood together examined the cabin of the Kingfisher, for such valu. ables as might be saved. Besides&amp; a case or two of weapons, medicine chest) charts, instruments, and the captain's and ship's papers, little else was found of sufficient value to remove to the cabin of the Privateer. In about an hour, the last living man having abandoned the sinking 'brig, the Privateer again spread her snowy white wings to the breeze, following the ship, which the survivors of the Kingfisher's crew acknow- ledged to be an American merchantman, with a  prize crew which waa put aboard of her from the brig on the day previous, and ordered to make all despatch for the nearest British port. The ship was now hull down, but the wind freshening, and the Yanker    <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6930-00000035"/> 6 "         THU FLYING YANKER; OR, cracking on all sail, she seemed to fly over the waters. Before sunset, she had gained on her sufficiently to be within speaking distance of "Miss Nancy." One word from her was all that was necessary-and when it was heard aboard the captured merchantman, the -British prize-master very wisely hove-to, without waiting for the ceremony of a second sum- mons. He had seen the fate of the Kingfisher; the tables were turned, and now, instead of holding the profitable and important position'of prize-master, he might consider himself a prisoner of the Yankee Priva- teer. The commander of the Flying Yankee, waving the ceremony of hailing, and ordering a boat to be sent aboard, rounded to, and brought his saucy craft alongside the merchantman, and demanded a surrender, which de- mand was complied with in a very obsequious and humble manner, for John Bull can show as much humility when he is in a " tight place," as he can arrogance and lordliness when he is "cock of the walk.". This is ohe of the most distinguishing traits of our transatlantic brethren; 'in the hour of triumph they exhibit neither modesty nor leniency, but in the hour of adversity, how chbp-fallen, how submissive, how servile, how like whipped spaniels do they appear. We say this in no spirit of unkindness, for, with all their faults, the English are a glorious race; their imperfec- tions arise from their institutions; the nobleman gives the first kick to the one first beneath him in rank; he passes the kick to the next in grade, and so down the kick goes vntil it reaches the lowest scullion, who lords it over the cur or the cat. So they tyrannize, one grade over another, and the lower you go in the tunnel of society, the more tyranny is to be found. The time may come, when the kick will ascend, but that time is not ours to see. The crew of the American merchanitman, including her Officers, who were heavily ironed, and stowed away in a loathsome place beneath the hatches, were now released and the ship restored to them, and the prize- crew, together with nearly all the prisoners on board of the Flying Yankee, were made to take their places in the hold of the merchantman, but Wil- lett gave instructions, if they behaved well, to ameliorate their condition, providing it could be done with safety. After adding three of his own gallant crew to that of the ship, and wishing the captain thereof a prosperous voyage homeward, the two ves- sels parted company, the ship standing towards the occident, and the Flying Yankee towards the orient. At daylight on the following morning--a thin mist covering the sea at the time-two vessels were descried alongside of each other; one was a large ship, apparently an English Indiaman, the other was an armed schooner. The wind was light at the time, and the Privateer was gliding smoothly along under mainsail, foresail, and jib. No sooner were the two vessels descried, than the strange schooner cleared from the ship, made all sail, and was soon 10st in the mist to the view of the Privateersmen. Willett and Fleetwood had both endeavored to make her out through the -glass, but could discern little else than her black hull and' the outline of her sails. "Charley," said the commander, " what do you think of her?" "The cut of her sails is not unlike our own," answered the lieuten- ant. "Yes, and the model of her hull, too. That craft, whatever she'may be now, was never built in Europe; she is a Baltimore clipper likie our own; and I strongly suspect she is the long missing twin. We must, however, know more of her. But first, let us board this ship."   THE CRUISE .OF THE..CLIPPXRS.  ',9 The Flying Yankee neared the merchantman and haile4. There,;w, no response! Again and again she was hailed, but no answer was return- ed. Here was a mystery! Her fore-topsail and fore-t'gallantsail were laid aback, and her maintopsail was trimmed to the breeze. She was a noble-looking ship, and everything alow and aloft, as seen from the Pri- vateer's deck, was in good condition. The schooner ran alongside, but there was not a single soul to greet her. Our hero mounted the gangway steps, and one glance explained the mystery. It was a hor- rible, .soul-sickenihg sight that met his gaze! The deck. was strewn with the bodies of massacred men, women, and even children! Massacred in cold blood, undoubtedly by a band of ruthless pirates! Not a living soul was to be seen! all was silent! all were hushed in death's icy embrace  For some moments our hero stood, amazed, appalled, at the horrible spec tacle! At length a low moan was heard, issuing from the cabin! Again and again it came dismally upon his ear!' Yes, there was one breathing soul in that deserted ship! He called his faithful Barington, and with :a half dozen Privateersmen, they commenced an examination of the ship. Willett and Barington descended into the cabin, where one of the sad- dest spectacles ever presented to human eyes met theirs! CHAPTER: IX. A bloody Picture in the cabin of the Indiaman.

"MY God!" exclaimed Willett, as he riveted his eyes upon the bloody tableaux which was presented to his gaze; "what a piteous spectacle is this!-what fiends could have committed such a horrid butchery?" "This is the work of Pirates!" said Fleetwood, turning his eyes away from the objects he encountered.  None less inhuman than cruel corsairs indeed could have, been the authors of such a scene! Lying upon the cabin floor were two headless trunks of full-grown men-their gory heads with ghastly features placed upon the table above them. Within a few feet, the corpse of a matronly. looking woman was lying, with her throat cut from ear to ear, the blood still warm, issuing from the ghastly gash! Upon her breast clung a strangled infant-the marks of a fiend's fingers still plainly visible upon its tender neck!' 'Within an arm's length of the mother and child, there was another-it was that of a young and supassingly beautiful girl- beautiful even in death, although marks of brutal violence disfigured that fair form, fair enough to be the model of the sculptor's beau-ideal of Beauty personified. A bloody stiletto she still clasped in her hand-that hand which doubtless had thrust the steel to an audacious villai'ss heart! But the murdered group is not yet fully described. A mulatto girl of perhaps seventeen summers-a fair type of the sunny land and cloud- less sky-lay weltering in purple gore! She, too, had suffered a worse fate than Death. /The despoilers of beauty and innocence-for there is wondrous beauty in the dark, golden-colored complexions of the maidens    <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6930-00000036"/> 74          THE FLYING YANKEE ; OR, of the tropical clime-had hacked her body as if they had regarded such brutality, as pastime! There was one prostrate folrmn molre-a young man, with a severe gash upon the head, and a stab-wound in the region- of the heart. He alone of that sangruinary tableaux showed any signs of life. Yet he seemed to be struggling. with the Great Destroyer himn self for the mastery. His respiration was heavy and difficult, and each breath was accompanied by a moan, piteous enough, humanity might think, to penetrate the heart of the arch-fiend himself! "Quick, Chiarley, quick!" cried Willett, after examnining each object of the heart-rending picture, " call the surgeon! There is life yet in this poor, wounded body!"  Fleetwood darted up the companion-way, and in a few moments re- turned with the surgeon of the Flying Yankee. He examined the wounds of him whom the ruthless wretches had left for a dead man-he probed them carefully-dressed them with skill, and at our heroic captain's com- mand, he was removed to the cabin of the Privateer, where he received such close and skilful attention, that, in a short time, the surgeon was warranted in pronouncing him convalescent, notwithstanding he had been brought so near to the brink of the grave. The bodies in the cabin and upon the deck, Willett caused, with as much decency as the terrible circumstances would permit, to be consigned to an ocean grave. He then put a prize-master on board of the ill- fated ship, with as many of his men as he could possibly spare, and ordered her to proceed to the first port that could be made in the United States. The vessel, as our commander had supposed, was a first-class Indiaman, both as respects tonnage, and in all her fitting up and appointments, The cargo, beneath the hatches, which was rich with the most valuaible pro- ducts of the Indies, the ruthless monsters had not overhauled. It was surmised that she must have had a large quantity of specie and gold dust aboard; that the Pirates, after murdering all the ship's colmpany, had secured that part of their booty, and then,before having an oppor- tunity to plunder the richest of the freight, they had been frightened from their prey by the sudden and unexpected appearance of the Flying Yankee! For three hours the schooner was obliged to lie by the ship, and after the captor had written to his consignees the particulars of the Inanner in which the Indiaman had fallen into his hands, and seeing that everything was in proper condition for sending the ship into port, the two vessels parted company. The weather, which had been misty during the morning, cleared up, and was succeeded by an unclouded sky, allowing the sun to shine brightly upon the clear blue waters; the wind, too, had been very light, but now began to freshen. As soon as the misty veil had entirely evaporated, they descried the schooner, which they had seen alongside of the merchantman, at a distance of about four leagues in an easterly direo- tion. Our hero had made known to his subordinates his earnest resolve to pursue and, if possible, punish this terrible scourge of the ocean, in which they heartily determined to support him to the extent of their energies. All sail was crowded upon the Flying Yankee, and she once more began to show her worthiness of the name she bore, and to show, in nautical parlance, a bone in her mouth. It was soon clearly evident that a long chase was before them, for the supposed buccaneer had spread every rag of canvas, not desiring an inter-   THE CRUISE OF THE CLIPPERS.       . 71 view with a craft of equal force, as the chase appeared to be. For hours they both stretched on, with the wind nearly abeam, without any per- ceptible diminishing of the distance between themi.-The most experienced helmsmen guided both vessels, and the utmost attention was exercised to keep the sails in good trimn.    - An hour befobre sunset a dark spot was discerned above the westerR horizon, no larger in appearance than a man's hand, but it rapidly in- creased in size, until it-assumed the character of a dense cloud. Ordi- nary prudence would have suggested to the commander of our flying craft to order, the reduction of her wide-spread and snowy wings, as it was usual for him to d'o on the first certain indication of a warring of the elements. But aslyet not a' sail had been ordered to be taken in, nor a rope to be slackened, although the wind was freshening at each moment. Soon the black, threatening mass had spread its raven wings athwart the western isky, and came sweeping on with terrible rapidity. Faint flashes were visible crinklingr in the dark mass, and the rumbling' of distant thunder portended a -heavy storm. Onward, faster and ftster, it came, spreading wider and wider over the arched expanse, until it reachedfrom the now angry surface of the waters, to the zenith of the heavens. Anon, the lightnilg flashes grew more vivid, until Jove's bolts seemed to, rend the clouds; crash upon crash, peal upon peal of deafening thunder, suc- ceeded each other with startling rapidity! This awful warning, although it had reduced the canvas of the fleeing vessel to a double-reefed mainsail and single head sail, as yet had not met with a corresponding reduction of canvas on board "of her pursuer. When the topmasts began to bend like a withe in the Iblast, our hero ordered the topgallantsail to be taken in, then the gaff-top-sail, staysail and jib, and single reefs in the mainsail and foresail. The stoutest-hearted mariner gazed with fearful forebodings upon their young commander with wonder and admiration.  Many an "old salt" declared that in all their experience they had never sailed with' the muaster who dared to "carry on" so in a gale of wind. There he stood, the hero of the battle and storm, with speaking-trumpet, in hand, his eagle eye glancing aloft, then at the black rolling masses be- hind and above him, then straining his vision at the' vessel he was pur- suing, and bearing himself as coolly ad if he himself were the god of the elements, and directed their power. With firm, riingng tones he gave forth his orders, which were executed with wonderful promptness, each sailor seeming to emulate each other in his exertion to keep the wings of the little craft, which bore them on with-such rapidity, in perfect trim. Every man appeared willing to risk even life itself, to obey the orders, ay, the slightest wish of their gallant master. A mighty rushing noise, borne on the wings of the wind, noth told the daring mariner that the tornado was about to overwhelm with its Worst fury his staunch and gallant vessel. ' Luff! luff!-steady!" he said coolly and calmly to the helmsman, At the same moment the foresail and staysail sheet, were let go. The schooner came up into -the wind, with sails shivering and lashing as' if they would tear themselves from the bolt-ropes! The terrific blow was struck! it fairly pressed the hull beneath the surfate--the windward shrouds were stretched to their utmost tension-the masts creaked with violence beneath the deck, and aloft bent like tall oaks in the tornado! Gradually the submerged hull came staggering up and cleared itself of the weight of water which had covered the deck-then mounting a heavy roller she shook and quaked as if about to be wrenched into a thousand    <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6930-00000037"/> 72 .THE FLYING YANKZE; OR, fragments! The men clung to the rigging during these fearful 'm- ments, and many a brave heart looked with mute astonishment upon one another, as if doubting whether they yet had a mortal exist. ence! The little craft had passed safely through the terrible ordea--the fury of the storm was over-the western horizon was once more unveiled, revealing the golden splendors of the retiring orb of day! The old tars now looked upon each other with a happier expression, a knowing look, a significant nod, as much as to say-we've nothing to fear while that man commands. "Aloft, there, boys!" cried Willett, with far more excitement than he had shown during those critical, trying moments; "loosen the fore topsail, then the fore t'-gallant sail! Shake out these reefs!" he said, addressing another group of tars. "Let every yard of canvas be made to draw." The pursued schooner had also weathered the gale, but having exer- cised usual caution in reducing sail during the prevalence of the fierce wind, she had allowed the chase very materially to lessen the distance between them. Two leagues now only separated her from her daring pursuer, but being again under a full press of canvas, and holding on to the same course, she maintained her position relatively for some time afterward. Night came-the sky was serene and cloudless-the stars shone out with extreme brilliancy, for the Queen of Night was not present to dim their lustre. Towards midnight, the privateer having been freed from some two feet of water made during the tornado, slowly gained upon the supposed Pirate, keeping her well in view notwithstanding the shadows of night; and our hero felt confident that by the dawn of another day, they would be enabled to salute her through the long gun; but his hopes at length were frustrated just as he thought he had the enemy within the play of that inveterate loud talker "Miss Nancy." They were now no longer in " blue water," but on soundings, making their course directly towards the English coast-it was just day-break, when a thick, impenetrable fog settled almost suddenly upon the waters, so that it was utterly impossible to discern any. object at a cable's length distance from either the pursued or the pursuer. Fortunately with the gloomy fog came a dead calm-fortunate only for the Privateersmen, for Willett knew that unless the craft he was anx- ious to meet should get out her boats, he would find her yet within reach of his glass, when the provoking veil of mist should finally be lifted from the waters. The Privateer scarcely moved, except with the current, but was tossed lazily over the long swelling billows of the Bay of Biscay. Another day passed-and another night-and the calm and the fog prevailed. During these tedious, monotonous hours, Willett sat beside the wounded man he had caused to be removed from the ship to the schooner, and who was now reclining upon a couch in the commander's cabin. Every attention, every comfort that the vessel afforded, was ex- tended to him. The patient was convalescent; he was recovering slowly but surely from the effects of his wounds, although yet unable to con- verse; and the physician positively forbade any conversation with him. Yet he essayed twice to commence the recital of a tale of horror, which the surgeon implored him, as he valued his life, to postpone narrating, until he should recover more of his wonted strength. On the third morning after losing sight of the pirate schooner, just   THE CRUISEB OF THEB CLIPPERS.  before day-break, a northerly 'breeze sprung up, which' sudd4nly-'drov from off the waters the intolerable gloomy, murky atmosphere, and once. more enabled our friends to look beyond the few fathoms' which had for so long a time been the confines of their vision. All hearts aboard of the Flying Yankee were made glad at the sight, but they .leaped with joy, when, within short carronade range, there was revealed the craft T1hey had so long been in pursuit of.  There was no beating to;quarters, no boatswain's whistle necessary to pipe the Privateersmen to duty, but the word being' passed quickly along, the men actively went to their stations, and received their orders in almost whispering tones. More activity and silent bustle, without the least con- fusion, were never beheld on the deck of a man-o'-war. A very few mo- ments elapsed ere the deck was cleared for action, the cartridges and- shot handed up, the carronades loaded, the matches lighted, and everything in readiness for battle! It was clearly evident that the bloody stranger had not made a sinul- taneous discovery; either there Was no watch kept, or they were asleep, or, possibly, their attention might be diverted by some other discovery. At all events there were yet no signs of preparation for the meeting of a foe close at hand; but there she was lying with topsail aback, and main- sail with peak dropped, sheeted to catch the breeze. The tiller was, ap- parently, lashed, for no helmsman's head could be seen above the tafferel. Never did two vessels, in outward appearance certainly, bear a nearer resemblance to each other. than did the Privateer and- her ruthless enemy, the Pirate. Hull, masts, yards, booms, sails, rigging, blocks, etc., all were alike. The only dissimilarity perceptible was in the fact that the name of the Flying Yankee, in gilt letters, was emblazoned on both quarters of the one, while upon the other, there' was no name visible either on the quarter, stern or bow. The remarkable similarity of the two vessels in all other respects, drew forth many a wondering enquiry, and not a few sagacious observations from the Yankee tars. While his orders were being executed, Willett kept a close scrutiny. upon the Pirate, for the first indication of surprise, or the firstindication of preparation for battle. But all was as quiet aboard of her, as if she had been abandoned by her crew. "I hate to attack even a venomous reptile when it is sleeping," re- marked our hero to, the quarter-master, when that officer reported that all was in readiness to commence the engagement.-. "That's all very well, sir," was the reply, "but that fellow would murder innocence itself, whether he found it slumbering or not. I think if she's a bloody piratical serpent, the more effectually we take the sting out of her, the less liable we shall be to get:bitteh ourselves. That's my opinion, captain, though I hope my giving of it will give not the least offence." "There's no danger of your offending me, quarter-master; besides, your suggestion I regard as a very propher one; :we are justified in crush- ing a deadly serpent before it shows its sting. 'In regard to that schooner, I am satisfied that she is the bloody buccaneer we have supposed her to be; but lest we might be mistaken in her true character at this moment, or that she may have fallen into less obnoxious hands, or, possibly iay' have been abandoned, suppose you pass the'word to Barington to-let ' Miss Nancy,' have the hInor of waking up that- sleeping craft, and upon the first new evicence'of her piratical character you may blaze away at her to your heart's content." The quarter-master, pleased with his instructions, went forward- to    <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6930-00000038"/> 74         - THE FLYING YANKEE; OR, bear the order to Barington and his favorite Miss Nancy, to open the ball. The formidable piece was already heavily shotted, and after hav- nig been carefully depressed by our expert gunner, the match was ap- -'plied, the gun broke the profound stillness by its bellowing, and the heavy shot was sent across the water on its destructive errand! 'A loud report and a crash, like the terrific thunder and its deadly bolt, came simultaneously upon the ears of scores of fiendish, brutal, bloody men, who were sleeping off the effects of a night's debauch! The heart- less wretches had all been madly drunk, and now were startled firom their besotted slumbers by the unexpected shock. With staggering gait and bewildered senses, they clambered to the deck, there to behold the schooner they had so much desired to escape from, and also to behold their shattered bulwarks-the effects of the first gun fromn the enemy. Ere anything like order was restored, they received a whole broadside from the foe, which made fearful havoc on the Pirate's deck. By dint of extraordinary exertion several of the guns were got in worklling condition. Before another broadside was fired from the Privateer's battery, the Yankee ensign was run up-the enemy answered by displaying the tri- colored bunting of France. Our hero knowing that that was a ruse, poured in another broadside. The tri-color calme down, and the Spanish flag was unfurled in its stead. But it was saluted by anlother broad- side, which, with the previous fire, had considerably cut up the bucca- neer. Their situation was b)eginning to look desperate--there was no possibility ot' escaping-the Yankee would not show the slightest respect for either the French or Spanish ensiguns, and the commander, proba- bly, well knew that the cross of St. George would meet with no better reception, so he boldly ran up the black flag of the corsair, with the em- blems of mortality, in white, cmblazoned upon it, with the hope that this might strike terror to the hearts of his enemies! But the corsair ensign could not daunt the courage of the brave Pri- vateersmen, who relllembered, too vividly, the horrible scene they had so recently witnessed, and now were eager to rid the ocean of these inlhu- man butchers! The buccaneers were now firing briskly, and al'though her guns were of the same calibre as those of their antagonist, they tmade but little im- pression upon her. The truth is, their batteries were not so well served as those on board the Yankee, and the pirates felt that they were growing weaker and weaker each moment. Willett, on finding that the enemy could not successfully cope with him, directed that the shot should take effect, if possible, considerably above the water-line of his antagonist, for, if it were within the bounds of possibility, he had set his heart upon capturing the schooner, and when he had done with her, to take her to the United States. In this, he felt a laudable pride, and added to his desire to spare her hull as much as it was possible. In men, spars, sails and rigging, there- fore, the corsair was now suffering severely, and as there was just suffi-. cient breeze to ripple the water, the Flying Yankee was nearing her each nomnent, raking her decks, and making havoc anlong her top-hamper at each broadside. The black ensign was finally shot away, and the dis- heartened wretches forsook their guns in the iron storm, and sought re' fuge below; and by the tismie the ever victorious Yankee clipper xanged along side, her deck showed no mnore signs of life than did the ship, whose crew these devils incarnate had murdered but a few days before. With sword in hand, Willett was the first man to leap on board the Pirate. He went on to the quarter-deck, and the-first object that met his   THE CRUISE OF THE CLIPPERS.        ' 75 :gaze was the black flag, covering the body of him whom our hero sup- 'posed to be the commander! 'A fitting shroud, indeed, for such a corpse, thought he! He lifted the black bunting from his face, and beheld, to his no little astonishment, the diabolical features of an old acquaintance, but a black-hearted enemy. They were those of the bloody miscreant, Hawkwing!  He had received but- a slight wound, and actually had feigned death, even to his own hell-hounds! Another hour of vengearice had come to. our adventurous commander. He called Barington, and the two friends together gazed at their common foe! The wretch finally opened his blood-shot ekes, and beheld with fear and trembling his captors exulting over his fall! "That beast at last has been caught in his own lair!" exclaimed Willett. And like a beast he, must die!" added Barington. "Quarteer! quarter!" pleaded the cowardly buccaneer chief. "No quarter to demons!" returned our hero. ' Mercy!" groaned the wretch. "Can you, wretched man, ask for quarter- or mercy from those you have so much wronged ." said'Willett; " can you ask it after having so frequently deluged youi. hands in purple gore I Oh, we have witnessed a recent example of the manlner in which you show quarter to men, women and childiren Your hands aie now stained with the blood of innocent, helpless beings-aye, even the infllmt at its mother's breast did not escape the brutal clutch of thy hands! :But we have thee now-you deserve a death of torture, more agonizing than we have the power of inflicting. --What is the best mode of disposiug of this wretched lump of human- ity, Barington i" "Run him up to the fore-yard," replied the sailor; "that would be my way; for, d'ye see, the sooner he ceases to contaminate the atmos- phere with his breath, the better for the world, and the sooner some hungry shark will get his breakfast!" "it shall be done," said the commander; " and this black flag shall be his winding-sheet! Send some one here to lash it about his carcass; and see that the skull and cross-bones are displayed, that they may designate what manner of creature the deadly ensign enshrouds!" "Oh, mercy! mercy!  pardon! pardon!" cried the doomed man. But the wretches cry was unheeded. Without farther delay; the form of the cruel, bloody fiend, Haykwing, arrayed in a fitting costume for eternity, was dragged into the waist of the schooner he had so recently commanded, with his hands tied behind him, and his legs firmly lashed. A   rope, dyed in crimson gore, was riven to the larboard end of the fore- yard, and the fatal noose was slipped about his neck! At a signal, he was run up and left dangling in the air, a most fiightful spectacle to gaze upon!  Ignominious as is such a death, it was too easy a one for such a wretch!        . Meanwhile this scene was being enacted, the crew were busy below in securing the pirates with cords. and one by one the blood-thirsty wretches were led upon deck and thrust overboard, where they made food for the sharks, which at all times hovered about that bloody craft. Among those who were thus led upon deck, there was one, an Irish. man, who sang out, most lustily- '"Quarther! quarther! By all the houly saints in the calendar, I'm not one o' the- pirates, but a poor, honest, desaved, human creatuie, who for the first time since he was born into the world, has got into bad corn-    <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6930-00000039"/> *76         THE FLYING YANKEE; OR, pany, bad cess to 'em!

Plaze, remimber I'm not one o' these inthirely, but as honest a man as ye'll find in all Tipperary." This speech was, to Willett's ears especially, uttered in familiar tones of voice, and he ordered him to be brought to the quarter-deck. The moment he saw the Irishman's face, he recognized the features of another old acquaintance,-they proving to be those of that traitorous son of the Emerald Isle, Barney O'Brunner, whose life he had. once at least spared. The poor Irish Devil sink upon his knees, and' begged most eloquently for mercy, repeated his asseverations of innocence, and backed it up by calling upon all the catholic saints known to the catholic creed to. confirm his innocence. Never did a guilty wretch beg harder for his life, and his punishment would probably have been commuted, had it not been for a condemning voice, which could be trusted, In the: hold of the Pirate vessel, was found a poor, half-starved negro, loaded with chains. The Privateersmen quickly knocked off the galling fetters, and led the poor creature upon the deck. Hle was brought to the commander, and, on looking into his face, the poor, emaciated negro uttered an exclamation of delight. "Massa Willett, gorra bress you!" "That's Quaco's voice, if I ant not mistaken," said he, gazing intently at the poor fellow. "Ees, massa, and dis is poor Quaco's body, wot dere is left of it," an- swered the old steward of the Timour. He had shipped as steward on board of the schooner, her character not then being developed, and when he afterwards found himself among a gang of sea-robbers and sea-murderers, he absolutely refused to do duty, and declared he would suffer death first. But, instead of killing -4in outright, they resolved that he should die a slow death by starvation. This was the substance of Quaco's story, and, on being questioned as to the innocence of the Irishman, with whom he was now confronted, he declared that a more blood-thirsty villain, not even excepting the chief, Hawkwing, belonged to the piratical crew. This evidence tallied so well with what Willett knew of his character, and having the most implicit confidence in the faithful Quaco, he ordered Barney O'Brunner to be strung up to the end of the starboard fore yard arm,. to serve to balance the body of his fiendish master., This mandate was promptly executed, and scarcely a greater villain than he ever dangled at the end of a rope; but we have avoided a reci- tal of his worst crimes, they not being essential to carry out the design of our romance. After these scepes on deck had occurred, and all the buccapeers that had been found summarily disposed of, the commander and lieutenant of the Privateer entered the cabin of their long-coveted prize, which they found far more richly and luxuriously furnished than the cabin of their own favorite craft. Gold and silver plate was profusely scattered upon the table, which had probably been set out for the chiefs breakfast before the moment when he was so unceremoniously disturbed; the carpet was Persian, and of the richest and softest texture; and the couches were co- vered with silken damask of the most costly manufacture. Upon opening a locker, there were revealed to the gaze of our two friends, gold and jewels apparently of immense value, promiscuously thrown-in together, as if the   THE CBRUtIS OP THE CLIPPERS.       it 'owner or owiers thought it would not pay for the trouble of assorting them. Riches, of various descriptions, met their eyes in whatever they into. There were several state-rooms, all of which they examined, with the exception of one-that was locked! The fact of its being locked was sufficient to excite their curiosity. 'There was no -key in the door, but one of a bunch of keyd which Willett had taken from Ilawkwing'sbelt, before the wretch's execution, fitted the lock. He turned the key and opened the door. But what was the astonishment of both Willett and Fleetwood, to behold seated upon a couch,' a female of most exquisite loveliness. Her white loose lobe' was in a disordered state; and she seemed to be playing with the lishevelled locks of raven hair which hung in rich profusion upon her snowy white bosom--her face was pale- her dark eyes, turned upon her playful work, gleamed with an unnatural lus- tre. Upon her intruders she looked, not,.but still kept on twining her silken tresses in her delicate,-taperfingers. It wasevident she was laboring under some astrainge mental mal4dy-perhaps that most dreadful of all dis- eases, insanity! "Fair, lady," essayed Willett, finding 'that their presence . drew no attention from her. "Fsir lady, an 'we be of any service to you  "                       . There was no answer-no sign--no look from her. Our- hero then ventured to take her by the hand; but the moment' his flesh came-in con. tact with hers, she started suddenly to her feet-clutched an poignard that she had concealed in her bosom, and held the gliaming blade'above her head, aimed as if it were her determination to plunge it into her own bosom, rather than to strike it into the. flesh of her intruders! It was, indeed, the weapon which, if it'could. not defend her-honorl it could at least take her life! Her eyes flashed with the fire of indignation as she raised the keen-edged blade, but when--she saw strangers before 'her-looking upon her with a most certain expression of compassion, the fiery flashes of her expressive eye changed into lambent gleamis A smile played upon her sweet lips-.. and her hand released the defender of her honor from its grasp, and the little blade ell ringing on the floor! , She: pushed aside the raven. tresses, and pressed her forehead with both hands, as ifa leaden weight rested upon her brain. She advanced a step;, and extended her hand to him who had scarcely touched it before. Willett took it within his own and led her slowly into the cabin. The air being close, he signified his desire that she should go upon deck. By gentle persuasion, in tones of kindness and sympathy, she again gave him her hand,and, without uttering an audible sound, permitted Willett. to accompany her whither - he desired ,she should go., The clear atmosphere: above seemed to have a cheering effect upon her spirits. She looked into: the wavy waters, and around the horizon, and into, the deep blue above. .Her upturned eyes. encountered the distorted countenance of the now dead chief of. the ruthless corsairs! She uttered a wild and startling shriek!-then she laughed, as if for; real joy-then wept bitterly. These alternate bursts of grief and joy were most unaccountable to the surgeowof the Privateer,.who was desired by Willett to watch 'her closely. and administer. relief if it was within his power! But he was possessed of no medicine that',could reach a diseased mind; but after watching her for some time, he communicated the opinion, he had hastily arrived at, to Willett, to the effect, that her symptoms showed nothing more than a tem- porairy derangement, which time, attention and gentle treatment would    <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6930-00000040"/> 78          THE. FLYING TANSXE; OR, restore her. This accorded well with Willett's opinion; he, too, believed that it was temporary, and that until within two or three days, she had been pertZectly sane; and, moreover, he fully believed that her present condition was owing to a very recent calamity ; that she was a passenger on board of the ill-fated Indiaman, and had witnessed the horrible massa- cre with her own eyes; that she had been forcibly conveyed to the pirate's cabin, and intended by the demons to be the only survivor of that ship's company 1 This was the plausible theory which Willett had formed in his own mind, and he hoped that circumstances might yet test its accuracy, and also restore the beautiful girl's mind to its former sane condition. For two or three days the Privateer and her prize lay side by side, during which time, the utmost activity had prevailed on board of the latter, in striving to restore her to her original condition, in which they sue- ceeded most admirably. The Flying Yankee's crew was then divided to man the prize. To Fleetwood was given the command, and Barington was promoted to fill the post made vacant by the transfer of Fleetwood. It was the understanding that the twin-vessels should cruise together, and that in case accident should separate them, instructions for future action were fully given and understood. The Pirate vessel had, since the wretches came into possession ofher, had no particular name. The name she had borne previously, was ascer- tained to have been the "Duke of York,"--the name-board having been discovered by the carpenter among a quantity of old lumber, in the car- penter's room. , This discovery, to our hero's mind, indicated that she had in the first place, as was suspected, fallen into the hands of the British cruisers, but how it was possible that she should have subsequently got into the hands of a gang of black-hearted pirates, headed by that arch- devil, Hawkwing, was truly a mystery, which not even our shrewd Yan. kees could utiravel! We must reserve for a nother chapter, the cruise of the FLNTA, (the name which was given the recaptured schqoner, by Willett,) in company with the Flying Yankee. They stood eastwardly, and boldly entered the English Channel-a dangerous cruising ground for Americans-but they had a noble purpose to accomplish, and resolute hearts to brave almost any danger I CH1APTER X.

ONCE more, with their snow-white canvas spread to the breeze, the twin-vessels, now no longer estranged from each other, but friends, sailed in consort, to battle with the enemy whenever occasion should offer, Twenty-four hours subsequent to the overthrow of the buccaneers, they were stretching their wings up the English channel, off the Isle of Wight. They had seen several vessels, but as yet no hostile flag had been shown. As they passed Dunnose, a squadron of British vessels, consisting of a   THg CRUISgB OF THE CLIPPERS.        79 first class frigate, a corvette, two armed brigs, and a lugger, were stand- ing out'towards the Channel fi'om Spithead. When the squadron, in line, passed Bemridge Point, the two schooners were discovered by them in the offing at a distance of about seven miles. Whether the commodore of the squadron suspected or not the char- acter of the two strangers,ait is certain that he signalized to all the ves- sels to crowd on-all sail for the purpose of overhauling them. The Fly- ing Yankee and her consort saw that they were to be pursued by a force that, to attempt to cope with, would be the height of mladness; their commanders knew- that they could run the whole squadron out of sight in three hours, by hauling up on a southwardly course, and thus showing ' their heels- at once. Prudence would have seemed to suggest this change; but they kept on, almost due eastwardly, as. if deigning to take no notice of the comparatively formidable fleet, which was standing E. S. E., with every sail that would draw set to the breeze, with an almost certain belief that they could be easily intercepted. But little did the English commander know the sailing qualities of the two strangers, until, when he found himself directly astern of the schooners, he ascertained that he was farther distant than when he first discovered them. And, after estinmating the advantages in sailing in a diagonal direction from his starting point, he estimated that they had made three Infles to his' two.  At sunset, the frigate, which was considerably in advance of the rest of the squadron, was nearly three leagues astern of the fleeing ves- sels, and when the first shades of evening hovered over the waters, the pursuer and the pursued were entirely invisible to each other. It was now that the pursued Yankees suddenly changed their course, and stretched of close-hauled in a S. E. by S. direction, towards the shore of France.  It now being luite dark, and no danger of a meeting fio'm the chase, they tacked andSthod northwardly. Meanwhile the British squadron continued on the same course, up the Channel, with the hope that, by the dawn of another day, the fleeing schooners might be intercepted by the English cruisers, which were known to be in the Straits of Dover, little dreaming that the Yankees would have the temerity to elude them by standing towards the French coast, far enough to allow the squadron to pass, then to stand towards the English coast far enough astern of the chase to be un- observed. It was a bold ruse, but it succeeded admirably, though it could scarcely have been done by any other two vessels afloat. Thus while the Eng. lishmen were winging their way on a "wild-goose chase," the pair of Yankliee Privateers, after sending down their topmasts, yards. and other top-hamper, made their way into a little bay or. inlet, which at that day was seldom frequented by vessels, but was well known to the young Eng. lishman, whom Willett had rescued from the Indiaman, and also to, two or three of the Privateer seamen. This inlet is in the vicinity of Beachy Head, and the entrance being narrow and crooked, vessels, with their top-hamper down, could lie behind the chalky cliff, which intercepted a view of the channel. Here they came to an anchorage without being perceived, for there were no inhabitants residing within half a mile; and if, when daylight came, a chance visitor should make the discovery, the Cross of St. George flying at the peak of one or both of the vessels, would quiet all suspi- cion. The very fact of 'their being there would have sufficed for this purpose, for what Yankee or Frenchman, or any other belligerent craft would dare thus to enter into the very jaws of the British liin?    <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6930-00000041"/> df          TTH FLYING YANKEE; OR, A barge from each of the Privateers was immediately manned, and in the stern sheets of that of the Flying Yankee, sat our hero, and the- young Englishman who had nearly recovered from the wounds inflicted upon him by the merciless Pirates; and in that of the Fleta, sat Fleet- wood and the young and beautiful girl, who was discovered in a demented state in the state-room if lawkwing's cabin. The girl had partially recovered, but some fatal calamity still operated to becloud her senses; there was a chord out of tune, which needed to be struck by an unknown. power to cause it to vibrate in harmony with the tender strings of her susceptible soul. That done, and a brighter or purer being did not exist among the fair daughters of Albion. With six stalwart oarsmen and a cockswain to each, the barges shot out from the inlet, and at a rapid rate pursued their way along the shore to the little port of New Haven, at the mouth of the xiver Ouse, then an insignificant place, but now of considerable notoriety; more, perhaps on account of having been the landing place of Louis Philippe; when that monarch abdicated his throne and fled from fickle France, than for its line of steamers to Dieppe, or for the many fishing smacks which now make it their haven. Into this little harbor the Yankee barges boldly pushed their way, went up the river a short distance, hauled up on the sandy beach where our two Privateer officers, the Englishman and the maiden disembarked. The night being somewhat dark, faces could not be easily distinguished. After giving some definite instructions to the cockswains, Willett and the landed party proceeded up to the village, while the boats shoved off and returned to the little inlet where the two schooners were securely moored. A walk of a few minutes brought. Willett and the young Englishman -the latter acting as guide-to an ancitnt-looking inn, being the only ublic-house of which the place could boast. It was past the midnight tour, when the landlord was aroused from his slumbers by unexpected guests. Mine host, a bustling, good-natured looking Englishman, with a face, the complexion of rare roast beef, and a nose somewhat more deeply dyed, quickly made his appearance at the door, and admitted the four visitors, Fleetwood with his charge having now rejoined them. "Ah, Vimmer, my old boy," said the young man, addressing the land- lord in the most familiar manner, and at the same time giving him a slap on the shoulder, "I am pleased to see you once more; the very sight of you makes a sad man feel cheerful." "It duz, duz it ' said the landlord, "I wish I might return the compliment; "but as I duz'nt know yer, it's hall the same, pervidin' yer honest folk, and have plenty of the king's likenesses in yer pocket." '"Well, Vimmer, I'll tell you what we want," resumed the familiar gentleman; "let it be the best your house and stable afford; in short, Vimmer, we would have some refreshment;. and, while we are partaking of it, harness the fastest span of horses in your stable to your best car. riage. If you still pride yourself on owning that magnificent pair. of bays, which carried his Majesty to Brighthelmstone, some three years ago, why, that team will do-it's good enough for Ua!" ;"Well, I thinks so too, young man," said the landlord, holding the light up to the stranger's face; "egad, I think what's good enough for the king, is good enough for a commoner, any day-beg yer pardon, yer   / THE CRUISE OF THE CLIPPERS.        81 'onor's pardon-yer lordship's pardon, if I can believe my own eyes, and ye're the nephew and heir of the old lord who died in the Indies some months ago." "Ask me no questions, and 1 will ask thee none, except that which appertains to our wants," said the supposed young sprig of nobi- lity. "Yer lordship has lut to speak, and the best the house affords will presently be served," said the landlord, feeling delighted with the very idea of having a noble guest in his house. "Be but quick, Vimmer; for we must be on our journey soon." "Before the morrow ." "Ay, before daybreak." "Egad, ye shall be obeyed; 'tis not the likes of Giles Vimmer to detain company at his inn, just for the sake of making a few additional crowns. Egad, no-inns are for accommodation-accommodation is my motto." "Then attend to the orders which we have given, that your boasted motto may be tested," said the young stranger. The landlord made his exit, and in a few moments his house was alive with the bustling of servants, preparing an early repast for his distin. guished guests. As yet the young nobleman, as Boniface insisted that such was his distinction, had not yet seen the face of the hapless maiden, who was now under Fleetwood's charge.-She was seated, partially reclining upon a sofa, in an apartment adjoining the coffee-room, her head resting upon her delicate hand, and the light shone on her singularly beautiful yet troubled countenance. As the young man entered the-room, his eye fell upon the demented girl, while her gaze was fixed upon a marble statu. ette which stood on a bracket in a corner of the room. She was dressed in a white robe, and her hair hung wildly about her alabaster neck in the most negligee manner, giving her a nymph-like appearance, rather than that of a material existence. She took no heed of what was going on about her, or of any one present. She seemed as mild as a child, and could be led as a child. The youth, on the first glance of his eye towards her, started back as if he had encountered an apparition-not in fear but in wonder! For some moments he gazed upon her with intense eagerness, and stretching forth his hand, and trembling with an excess of con- flicting emotions-of hope, joy, doubt-he essayed to speak, but the words seemed to hang on his quivering lips. At length, he ex- claimed- "Look-look upon me! Speak!-do my eyes deceive me? Art thou a phantom! or dost thou still live, my own-my own-" She moved not her eyes from the object on which they were abstract- edly fixed; nor did she seem to have caught a single word that was ut- tered. This added to his doubts-his fears. He approached her, still with outstretched hands, eager looks, and trembling nerves. lie took that fair, white hand, as if he feared that he was about to grasp an in- corporeal thing--a shadow! But there was substance in his tender grasp. -it was iiot an unreal thing, as he almost feared! And now, in the excess of joy, he once more exclaimed- "Look upon me! Speak, my Imilda! Is this a visi6n of my disordered, imagination, or do I behold the eagain, living? Speak, Imilda! my own. Imilda! I conjure thee, hear and answer me! Imilda! It is Ernest who calls!"  6     <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6930-00000042"/> The name of Ernest seemed to startle her! She withdrew her hand from his gentle pressure, and with both hands parted the disordered locks from off her fair brow; then sitting upright, she withdrew her gaze from the object on which it had been abstractedly fixed, and turneb her eyes slowly and mechanically upon him who sat with trembling eagerness beside her. She met his gaze.-A mist seemed suddenly to fall from her eyes-she tried to speak, but she, like him a few moments before, was choked with violent emotion-she gave utterance to a loud scream, but it was the first outhreak of a joyful heart-she threw her arms about his neck, while tears flowed from a fountain, which for days had not moistened those heavenly, dove-like eyes. "Imilda! my own loved Imilda! how is this?" he asked, as the fair girl rested her head lovingly upon his breast. "How came you hither? By what miracle were you saved?- I thought I saw you--Oh, God! that dreadful hour! I dare not recall it to my memory!" "Ernest!" said she, looking into his face with a bewildered gaze, but no longer with that demented expression. "Where am I? we are no longer upon the ocean-this is a room in a mansion, not a cabin in a ship -say, Ernest, how is this? how came we here? in what country? in what place?" "In our own dear native land, Imilda-in the county of our home-'tis but two hours ride to Woodville Hall," said Ernest, sooth. ingly. "By what magic came we here?" asked Imilda, who seemed suddenly to have returned to her senses. " 'Twas but apparently now I was on the broad ocean, many leagues from dear England--and, oh, horror! the im- prisoned slave of a giant fiend, who bore me through smoke and flames from those I'loved! And, Ernest, I saw the wretches strike thee down! Was it not so? Have I dreamed these horrible scenes? Are they but pic- tures of my imagination? My senses could not have thus deceived me! -and yet, 'tis strange-how came I here?-and you, why should you be here, too? Explain this mystery, Ernest." "Why I am here, is no mystery; but that you are here, is almost incredible," said he; " but let us not distract our thoughts by attempting to explain these things now; let it suffice that we are united once more-and let us be thankfll that Heaven has preserved our lives!" There were tears of joy and tears of grief shed by these betrothed lovers, who by the gallantry of two American officers were restored to each other:-tears of joy that they were once more in each other's arms, and tears of grief for those missing friends, who were mercilessly but- chered by a worse than savage foe. Willett and Fleetwood, who sat at the opposite end of the room, were witnesses of the whole of this interesting scene, and they were rejoiced that through their efforts so much happiness was gained to two human beings. Yet, in the heart of our hero, it revived feelings of sadness which he could scarcely repress. Imilda was now introduced to our American friends. She received them in a lady-like manner, but with the samne proper reserve as if they had now met for the first time; and yet, there had not been an hour for several days, when Fleetwood had not watched over her with the same care and attention as he would have done over a wife, over a sister, or over a child under similar circumstances. But when Ernest intimated to them that to these two gentlemen he owed his life, all restraint, all reserve disappeared in an instant. She ran towards them, expressed her   'rTlE CUUISE OF THE. CLIPPERS.       83 great- gratitude in a variety of ways, even going. so far as,.to kiss them, which, under the circumstances must not be deemed a breach of decorum;; and we know that our readers will excuse it, when we inform them that the lover did no less. * Despite Ernest's efforts to repress a burning desire and curiosity to unravel what seemed to him exceedingly mysterious, yet he could con- verse scarcely upon any other subject. Willett, perceiving the eager wish that he, together with Inlilda, felt, to penetrate that which appeared a mystery, volunteered to unravel it, if they-desired him so to do. They gave him an affirmative answer, and our hero proceeded to narrate with accuracy, all the particulars which are known to the reader, carefully striving, however, in his graphic account, to conceal ir subdue the hor. rible scenes which met his eye on board the Indiaman. That portion, relating to Imilda, he reserved foi- Fleetwood to describe, which h e did in a manner admirably. calculated to produce the best possible effect on the minds of his highly interested and interesting auditors. : Grieved as their mind were at the darkest scenes described, yet the recital served to satisfy their minds upon -several points, which, nnexplained, would always have been a source of annoyance and wonder- ment. "Oh, gentlemen," said Ernest, after the explanation, "how shall I ever repay your manifold kindnesses!. Bereft of my 'Imilda, life would truly be insupportable. I can, at least, regard you among my noblest, warmest, best friends. I owe you a double debt of gratitude, and although my country is at war with yours, that debt, if within my power, shall be repaid."           ; "We ask no requital for performing a duty, which, as men, we could not shrink from," replied our hero; "but, touching the matter which I -have already confided to you, if it should so occur that Hshould need your services to assist me, may Hcommand them!"  "By all means;- I should feel myself a despicable, ungrateful wretch, should I refuse."                  .  "And as to our daring to land on these shores, and to have the temerity to penetrate into an enemy's country " said. Willett, enquir. ingly.  "'1 will tear my tongue out by the roots rather than betray you!"  "Should we be taken here, you know how we should be re. garded!" "I do; they would endeavor to make out that you were a spy; but our evidence would give such a charge She lie!" "It takes but little to condemn an American on this soil!. .. "Should these apprehensions of yours be realized, I have-,power .and influence to protect you. -But, fear nothing--while on these shores and with me; there is no difficulty of passing you off for Englishnen, and friends of Lord Woodville!"           .  -     ..

Our party were soon seated in'the' luxurious yehicle-the coachman cracked his whip, and it rolled rapidly away. Ere we recount the results of this adventure-at least on the part of the two Americans--we deem it essential to our story to make a slight retrograde movement, for the purpose of again present- ing one or two characters, in whom we feel a more than ordinary interest. Fleta Fleetwood, whom we trust that the reader has felt sufficieint  interest in not to have forgotten, had passed, like her dearest friends, through some strange adventures, since we lost sight of her in so myste- rious a manner at the disreputable house, occupied by the Minthlossoms at Portsmouth. Had Martha, the unfortunate friend of Fleta, examined closely the closet' of the room, of which mention has been made, she would there have discovered a key to the mystery. There was, appa- rently, no door, the back of the closet being paneled, and old clothes hung there, probably to hide the secret; but a shrewd observer, by ro- moving the panel, would have supposed at once that here was a means of ingress, and, when not fastened on the opposite side, a means of egress. Such was the. fact-it was contrived for the purpose of robbing euch victims whom the Minthlossom nymphs could succeed in enticing into this infamous trap, and for other diabolical purposes. It was past midnight, on that fatal night, when the old Sybaritic hag of the establishment, with a dark lantern in her hand, opened the door, and, followed by a tall, muscular-framed ruffian, in a hideous disguise, noiselessly entered the chamber where Innocence and Beauty lay wrapped -in profound slumber. The old hag drew the slide of the lantern, and its beams reflected upon the features of that fair and lovely flower, now sleeping sweetly, and, compared to the bloated, wrinkled creature who bent over her, she resembled an angel in Paradise. If one was human, the other was spiritual; for these two could scarcely be said to have belonged to the same species, and one would have been skeptical as to the generally received opinion that Eve was the common mother of the human race. The dark-looking ruffian took from about his neck a heavy scarf, while the old hag produced a plaster of villanous pitch. This she quickly placed with her brawny hand over Fleta's mouth, and at the next moment the ruffian had the scarf over her head and face, and seizing her in his athletic arms, he quickly withdrew from the room by the secret entrance, followed closely by the hellish Sybarite! There was but one stifled scream heard, but it was too late to reveal the manner of her disappearance to the ever faithful Martha! And it was fortunate for tie latter that it was so, for in the girdle of the haggish fiend hung a weapon, which was to have let out her heart's blood, had she roused up even to witness the diabolical act. Thus is the mystery attendant upon Fleta's disappearance from the room explained. Thence she was borne to a carriage awaiting at the door, and being accompanied by the hag and the ruffian, they were driven furiously away. The scarf and plaster were now removed, but they found their poor victim insensible-nearly smothered to death; and it was some time ere the currents of life were made to course freely through her veins. *o   THE CRUISE OF THE CLIPPERS.        85 Onward, through the dark gloom, and almost with the swiftness of the wind, sped the horses, stopping only for relays at Chichester and Shore- ham; and, at an early hour the next day, the carriage drew up before a summer villa at New Haven, near the water's side, and not more than a hundred yards from the inn of Giles Virnmer. The character of this villa was well known to all the inhabitants of this place; and for a few months in summer, the old Sybarite, Minthlossom, and the younger Mint- blossoms here resided, and pursped their licentious, soul-destroying busi- ness. The villa was a low, gothic edifice, all of the rooms, excepting two, being upon the ground floor, Into the one, fronting upon the street, Fleta was conveyed and made a prisoner, having for a jailer the old Mint- blossom, who deigned to visit her twice a day for the purpose of con- veying her food sufficient to sustain life, and to use every means to cor- rupt her pure soul; but the hag might as well have attempted to purify her own putrescent body, as to attempt to defile the soul of the immacu- late Fleta. We will not attempt to describe the anguish of our heroine through the terrible ordeal she was passing; the severity of her trials was suffi- cient to have driven most of her sex to distraction, if not to the grave, had they to pass through such scenes. But Fleta, though young, and -frail in body, had a mind to endure, all, firmness of purpose to resist- . even unto sacrificing her own life as the alternative- -their iniquitous in- tents, and Hope that Providence would deliver her out of the hands of her wicked persecutors. After an imprisonment of three days, without seeing any other but the brutal face of her keeper, she received a visit from the famous Captain Dashington, to whom, it was given out, " the little beauty belonged." We forbear to describe the arts he used to make a conquest; let it suffice that, at his first interview he used tender expressions, treated her kindly, and made a most futile effort to be elegant and fascinating in his manners. As well might the arch-fiend himself, in the most hideous form ever as- sumed, have attempted to appear fascinating in her sight, as this intrud- ing villain. At his second visit, the miserable fool proposed " an honor- able marriage," as he termed it, but she spurned him as she would have done a biting cur. On the occasion of his third visit, he had the temerity to assault her as he had done Once before. His life would have paid the forfeit, had not the glittering blade been wrested from her hand, ere it reached his heart, whither she had directed it. Thus disarmed, she rushed to the casement, threw it open, and, to avoid the contaminating touch of the sensual viper, she boldly sprang into the street, It was broad daylight, and several persons saw the fearful leap. The incident created an alarm, and a crowd of people quickly gath- ered, amontg whom it was reported that one of Madame Minthlossom's Cyprians had committed suicide, and as these creatures were justly in very bad repute among the honest fishermen of the place, there was but little sympathy expressed for the poor creature lying senseless, and, as they supposed, dead before them; in. truth, many seemed rejoiced that there was one less of these contaminating creatures to flaunt through the town, corrupting with their very presence the unsophisticated and young portion of the, population. It so occurred that, at thetime of this occurrence, a handsome carriage, on which was emblazoned a coronet, was driven from Giles Vimmer's door, and proceeded on its route, which lay by the Sybarite's villa.

On arriving at the scene of the unusual excitenment, he toldhis coachman to stop; he immediately alighted; the crowd, as if by a natural instinct, gave way for him. He approached. the insensible girl, and tak- ing up her hand, and looking into her face, he saw that life was not ex- tinct. He, with the assistance of the coachman, lifted her into the vehi- cle, and getting in himself, he bade him walk the horses to the door of the village physician, who dwelt near by. Fortunately, the doctor was at home, and finding that his visitor was a nobleman, he met him before he had reached the door, and, pointing to the poor patient, bade him use his utmost skill and assiduity to restore, her. She was conveyed into the house, and after learning the particulars of the accident, and finding that she had received only some slight bruises, but a somewhat severe shock to the system, he hesitated not to assure his noble visitor that the accident could not be fatal, unless some unfavorable symptoms should make their appearance, which were not then to be per- ceived. With this assurance, the benevolent gerntleman, after charging the doctor to be unwearied in his attentions to her until she was out of danger, and with a promise that he would call again within two or three days to see the patient, he took his departure. Fleta, in a few hours, recovered her consciousness, and was compara- tively happy to tind that she was among people, who, instead' of endeav- oring to disgrace her, were lavish in their kindness, and attentive to her every want. Under these circumstances her recovery was rapid, and on the third day she appeared to feel better, physically and mentally, than she had for weeks immediately preceding. It was on this day that her kind and truly noble benefactor called, to whom she was introduced by the physician, who assured him that he believed her pure and innocent, and worthy of the noble lord's humane consideration. Fleta had that morning confided to the good doctor an outline of her eventful history, and the facts in regard to her being a compulsory inmate of that den ot infamy, and her reason for jeopardizing her life by leaping from the winll dow. The indignant nobleman, when apprised of the facts, immediately caused the arrest of all the inmates of -the Cyprian villa, and had them incarce- rated in jail to await their trial for their present and past misdeeds. The facts in the case also got noised among the people; their indignation became aroused; and as the Cyprian villa was regarded as a plague spot upon that otherwise virtuous town, it was attacked on the night following by a party of men in disguise, and levelled to the ground. fleta was offered an asylum beneath the nobleman's mansion, and it was accepted, and on the night subsequent to her meeting him, she slept on a downy pillow within the walls of one of the finest country spats of which aristocratic England could boast at that period. Lord Guilford--the name of the nobleman, under'whose hospitable  roof our heroine found an asylum-was a widower, and, besides his do- mestics, his whole family consisted of one daughter, of about the same age with Fleta, and a son, who was then in the army. He was now itlourning the loss of a younger brother, tidings of whose death he had but recently received from India, where he had received by his eminent services the highest honors which his sovereign could bestow upon hiln. The deceased had left a widow and two daughters, all of whom were ex- pected at Guilford manor in a few months. He had also left a nephew, an active and intelligent young man, the heir to his title and fortune, who would embark for England as soon as the affairs of his deceased uncle oulld so be adjusted as to permnit, him.   THE CRItSE Or THEI CLIPPERS.        f After a lapse of several months subsequent to Fleta's arrival at the manor, the noble lady and her two daughters arrived at Guilford manor, much to the joy of all parties. A few weeks more elapsed, when Lord Guilford had tidings from his nephew, who wrote that he should embark for England in the first ship that sailed. We deem it necessary to state these facts, as they have a bearing upon the final development of the plot of our story. After the foregoiig necessary deviation from .the direct course of our narrative, let us return to the party who left Giles Vimmer's Inn in a carriage, immediately after the recognition and happy meeting of Ernest and Imilda. It was some two hours after sunrise as they were passing the wide domain of Woodville, that a corps of mounted troops came sweep. ing up the road at a rapid pace. After passing the carriage, they halted, when the captain. turned back and saluted the inmates of the carriage. Ernest ordered the coachman to stop, and recognizing in the captain an old acquaintance, addressed him- "Sir George Lanmere, if I amn not mistaken V?" "By St. George and- the Dragon!" exclaimled the officer, leaning to- wards the carriage fi rm his horse; " if my eyes deceive me not, in you I recognize my old University chum, Sir Ernest--beg pardon the lord of Woodville." "Never mind the title, my old friend," returned Ernest; " but come to Woodville manor and let us compare notes. I wish there to introduce you to some kindred'spirits, who'arrived with me but yesterday." "I will avail myself of your kind invitation on the first opportunity," said the gallant-looking officer; " but ,my duty now compels me to ad. vance on with my- command. I am in, search of a pair of original charac- ters on these shores--a brace of Yankee spies!" "Can it be -possible there can be spies of our transatlantic enemies among us?" ejaculated Ernest, apparently greatly surprised. "Not only possible but positive, my dear fellow!" answered the officer. "Have you seen anything resembling a couple of semi-savages froim the new wNorld, on the road ."  'Nothing of the kind, assure you," returned his lordship spilrtedly. "How came you by this precious bit of information, concerning spies?" "From a servanht at Giles .Vimmer's Inn, who heard them conversing firom behind a secret panel, at an early hour this very morning. Oh, it will go hard with them, if we do take them; and. we're quite sure to do it. By the by, it is rumored that there are Yankee cruisers in the channel. If' so, rely on it, they meditate mischief. Who knows but another Paul Jones may be in their midst? But, I forget my duty-good day to your lordship." "Good day, Sir .leorge." The baronet captain spurred the flanks of his horse, and at a full gallop quickly reached the head of his troop, and the whole body pressed'rapidly on as before. "A narrow escape, my friends!" said Ernest, as soon as the officer left him; " but his rather ludicrous ideas of Americans deceived him." "I suppose," remarked Willett, in a quiet manner, "that could my firiend Fleetwood amid myself boast of the rich copper color of the savage, and had been so imprudent as tocarry a tomahawk, a scalping knife, and a war club, with a wampum belf,:and a head dress of eagle's feathers or the skin of a: catamount, and a blanket upon our shoulders, we might now have been marching in a hollow square of yonder troop!"    <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6930-00000045"/> 6)         . TIIE FLYING YANKEE; OR, Upon my word, my friend, your,satire is too keen," returned Ernest; ^ for 1 assure you my quondom friend, Lanmere, is a very worthy fellow, albeit he is decidedly ignorant in regard to Americans. If he comes to Woodville., I shall be delighted to make you both acquainted with him; and vou, too, my dear Imilda." "Ah, Ernest, I fear that would be very imprudent, especially for our friends here," remarked Imilda. "Oh, never fear, my Imilda; my friends need apprehend no danger while guests of mine," replied Ernest. "I shall introduce them as my ship companions, which will not, after all, be very far froin the truth. ; Ah! here we are, at length, at the gate of Woodville Park," he contin- ued as the horses turned into a gateway, and travelled rapidly up a smooth avenue, bordered with majestic and magnificent trees. "Let's see what sort of a reception we shall meet with here; and, then, gentlemen, we, will set ouselves at work upon the laudable enterprise in which you are en- gaged." The young lord of Wdodville was daily expected to arrive at his seat, though it was uncertain when he would make his appearance. However, his arrival was quickly known to those about the manor. and many of the tenantry and servants quickly assembled to welcome him, and they were vociferous in their shouts of greeting. He thanked them for their kind reception; but excused himself from'entering into any festivities on that day, on the ground that he was fatigued, and had immediate pressingl busi- ness to attend to, and finally dismissed them with a promise to meet them at an early day to exchange congratulations. A few hours passed away, and the young nobleman, accompanied by Willett and Fleetwood, left the manor in a carriage, with a coronet embla- zoned upon the panel. CHAPTER XI.

Joyous Conclusion. Two leagues from Woodville manor, was situated the noble country seat of Lord Guilford, the uricle of Ernest, now lord of Woodville. It was near the hour of sunset, when the carriage, containing the young lord and his two guests, our hero and his friend, drove up to the princely residence of Guilford. The lordly proprietor, with another gentleman, a guest, had just dined, and were about to rejoin the ladies who were amusing themselves in roaming about the beautiful, flower-adorned grounds, when the heavy, aristocraticlooking vehicle appeared. "By all my hopes! I should know that face!-'tis Ernest's!--Ernest has arrived!" shouted the old gentleman, as he perceived his nephew, standing up in the open vehicle, waving a salutation to him. For the first time in ten years the old nobleman actually got up a gait faster than a walk, and reached the carriage and got Ernest by the lhand, ere the coachman could let down the steps. The youth leaped from the carriage%   THE CRUISE OF THE CLIPPERS. .89 and Lord Guilford embraced hint with as much joy as he would have done an only son, "Captain," said the enthusiastic nobleman, calling his guest, "you know Ernest, my nephew, the, lord of Woodville-you must have met in India; in fact, we were talking about you to-day, at dinner." "Ah, that we have!" said Ernest, cordially saluting the gentleman, who was styled '" the captain." "Well, ny boy,;' resumed the old lord, "I am right glad to see you in merry England once more. But who are these gentlemen who accom- pany you?' he asked, in an under tone. "Beg pardon, uncle," said Ernest, presenting Willett and Fleetwood; permit me to introduce to you, Captain Arthur Stacy, and Lieutenant Jasper Ross of the Navy, two of the warmest and the- noblest friends I have in the world, and to whom I owe much more than my gratitude. Gentlemen, this is my uncle, the Lord Guilford, of whom you have heard me frequently speak." The nobleman received his nephew's acquaintances with his accustomed cordiality, then turning to " the captain," his guest, he said, " allow hme to present to you Captain Stacy, and Lieutenant Ross, my nephew's friends; this, gentlemen, is my friend, Captain Inglefield of the East India Com- pany's service.'  The hands of the English and Yankee captains were clasped-their eyes had been fixed upon each other previously-and now they stood, face to face, and hand to hand, with no little embarrassment, which the old lord did not perceive, as he had fallen into a sort of brown study, striv- ing to recollect whether he had ever or not seen the names of Stacy and Ross in the United Service Register. Fleetwood, too, was equally em- barrassed, but this did not prevent a cordial and happy greeting. It was a&amp;surprise, and although Captain Inglefield might have felt a slight regret at meeting them there, on account of the apparent imprudence of the thing, yet he did not express it in any manner. During the brief mo- ments they stood regarding each other, he reviewed in his mind all the somewhat remarkable particulars of their first interview, and the only matter which (" stuck in his crop," was that of the king's treasures; yet, take -all in all, how nobly, how generously they had acted towards him.      . The old lord, not being able to satisfy his mind on the subject upon which it was brooding, dismissed it altogether, and hastened off to bring the ladies up to receive their noble cousin. As soon as he was out of hearing, Captain Inglefield said- "D-n my buttons! if ye are not the young gentlemen, whom I met in an unlucky hour on the high seas, may I never see blue water again! And your name is Willett, commander of that little flying clipper-the prettiest piece of water craft these old tarry eyes ever beheld. And you, sir," he continued, turning to Fleetwood,-" your name is -d-n me if I can remember; but I know of a young, sparkling-eyed, rosy-cheeked damsel, who will not forget it to the last day of her life."' "You have said aright, Captain Inglefield," replied Willett; "and had we, been allowed to have had any choice in the matter we should not have permitted our friend to have introduced us here by any other than our true characters.. We like not the showing of false colors, ,but since they are raised, I suppose we must sail under them for the present, for prudence' sake!"    <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6930-00000046"/> -90         THE FLYING YANKEE; OR, "Ah! I see how 'tis!--I'll be as dumb as a mummy," said Inglefield, a new thought seeming to strike him; "bright eyes-rosy cheeks--it's all right; but I'll give ye a word of caution, my friends-this is a ter- ribly dangerous cruising ground for Americans, and more especially for the officers of that black, snakish-looking hull of yours, whose actions have kicked up a greater breeze here in old England, than the captures of the whole Yankee fleet combined! Many believe her to be a..wizard craft, and that a cannon ball will glance from her planks as if they were made of solid steel.

Be cautious-his lordship is a wary old fox, but a nobler-hearted or more benevolent gentleman does not wear a title in his majesty's dominions, than he. , Be on your: guard-.be not surprised at anything or anybody you may meet hereabouts, nor at anything you may hear."     .: "Thank you, sir, for your warning counsel," replied Willett . "we will endeavor to profit by it." The old lord now approached with an elderly lady hanging upon his arm, while her twodaughters, nieces to his lordship, brought up. the rear. After receiving Ernest as became her dignity, which was of no common order, her two daughters greeted their noble cousin with much less dignity, but with much more affection; in fact, her ladyship thought it quite rude that they should return the kiss of any young' man, if he were their brother. The old lady was then introduced to the two strangers whom her nephew had brought with him, but not having her spectacles on her nose, she could not discern their features very distinctly; yet she could not help remarking that she thought she had seen both of their faces before, yet when or where she could not remember; it, might, she said, have been at Brighton, possibly in London, or, what was much more prob- able, in India. Not so, however, thought the two interesting young ladies, Misses Myrtilla and Minna, They remembered most vividly the time and place they had met these interesting strangers-a time when they expected to be taken prisoners and treated with barbaric cruelty; but instead of finding in their enemies a band of fierce, unrelenting buccaneers or bar-   THE CRUISE OF THE' CLIPPERS.        91 barians, they found as generous-hearted and as polite young gentlemen as ever graced a quarter-deck. - If Miss Myrtilla was embarrassed on the introduction, what shall we say: of, the embarrassment of Minna-that Minna who lost a heart and made a reprisal of one on that ever memoiable occasion. Before her stood, and absolutely gently .pressing. her soft hand within his own, the very object who had occupied so much of her thoughts by night and..by day; he whom she had met but once and never expected to meetagain; he whom she had striven toiforget, but whose image was ever present to her mind. If her soft cheeks were wont to wear the hue of the blush rose, they now assumed the hue of the richest red flower. The youth, too, blushed with embarrassment; he had no more thought, of meeting that wondrously. beautiful being: again, than he had ,of meeting the fabled goddess of. the sea. In the battle and in the storm she had been constant in his memrory, but -he had so schooled his nind as to -regard her as a myth, and that the occasion of their meeting was but a dream.  Despite, however, the peculiar circumstances of the case, their good- breeding enabled them to pass through the formalities of the introduc- tion, without betraying their surprise to others; although the prudish old lady was once more slightly shocked to see her-- Minna's hand. tarry for more than one moment in that of a stranger. Willett, however, observed all; and he felt not-a little grieved that his friend Fleetwood had. too much love for one whom he now clearly saw was far, far beyond, his reach. She was allied to English nobility-his friend was but an American 'gentle-. man!-a vast distinction, at that day. He determined to forewarn his friend of his danger. After an hour had, passed in the exchange of civilities; the young noble- man took Willett apart, and said to him,--  "Do you observe, my friend,. Lieutenant Fleetwood and my sweet cousin, Minna, in yonder parterre?" "I do," replied Willett. "They seem to have struck up an extraordinary intimacy, considering that this is their first meeting," remarked Ernest. "You of the new world seem to have wonderful facility inifinding the shortest way to the hearts of the ladies." .  ,   .  ' "It is not their first Ineeting," replied our hero. . , "How is this'."

"Then come with me into my uncle's library," said Ernest; " there is probably no one there, and on the first opportunity, I will escort her hither." "Thanks, thanks," said Willett, and he followed Ernest into the man- sion and into the spacious apartment, where were shelved thousands of tomes in every department of literature. Ernest returned to the front of the house just as the carriage drove up. "Ernest, my boy!" shouted the old lord; " here is your cousin, and my young proteg6." The nephew advanced and saluted his cousin with a kiss; and his heart would have rejoiced to have bestowed the same token upon her lovely, angelic companion; but etiquette foibade him, and he was compelled to be content with taking her proffered hand within his own, a hand surpass- ing in beauty even that of his Imilda. "I marvel not," said he to himself, "the hazard my friend has run in landing upon these hostile shores, if this be the precious jewel he is in search of." "Where is Myrtilla?" enquired lord Guilford. "She is in the conservatory with Captain Inglefield," replied the matron. "Minna-where is she 1" "There she is, in the flower parterre, with that young stranger," answered the old lady; "and I must chide her for her familiarity with one whom she probably never set eyes on before." "And where is Captain-Captain-what did you say his name was, Ernest?" "Captain Stacy." "Where has he disappeared to '" "He has stepped within doors for a few minutes." "Odds bobs! why, it appears to me there has been a regular stampede among our new guests!" said the old nobleman; "I shall have to get out a drum and fife and beat up for recruits." The old lord hastened one way, and the old lady another, and Ginevra another, for the purpose of concentrating the straying party, leaving Ernest and the protege quite alone. They soon entered into a lively con- versation, walking in the meanwhile slowly towards the piazza of the mansion. "I have an especial prize for you," said Ernest. "For me ." ejaculated the angelic creature, gazing enquiringly into his face. "' Yes, lady, if you can answer to the name on this card." She looked upon a card which he produced, and replied,- "That is certainly my name." "Then," said he, "there is that in my uncle's library, which it has been my greatest pleasure to bring hither, and which I desire very much that you should see." "Is it a remarkable curiosity?" she asked. "I assure you that the Indies never produced anything more interest- ing-at least, I am certain, that you will think so." Expressing her willingness to see this remarkable product, she took his arm, and he escorted her into the magnificent library, she wondering in   THE CRUISE OF THE CLIPPERS.        93 the meantime whether her eyes were to be feasted with some great na- tural curiosity, or some Brahnlinical idol. Willett stood beneath the shadow of heavily draperied curtains, directly opposite the entrance, trembling with eagerness, and almost with apprehension, lest another than the object who filled his whole soul, should make her entrance. But the first glance dissipated all apprehen- sions! "The wretch, Dashington, did not deceive me in this!" he ejaculated to himself. "There stands the curiosity I brought you hither to see!" said Ernest, pointing to the figure in the shadow opposite. Why, it's a man!" she whispered, startlingly. "True." "Who is it?" she eagerly asked in whispering tones. "Come forth, my friend!" said Ernest. Willett advanced with outstretched arms, and with a wild, exuberant gush of joy, exclaimed- "FLETA! FLETA!?tis Frank who calls." Those words'-that voice- went thrillingly to the heart of the maiden  In another moment she was clasped in his arms! "Oh, God! I thank thee for this moment!" cried our enraptured hero. "Fleta, I have found thee at last!" "Oh, joy! this is so unexpected!" said Fleta, clinging to his manly form, while tears flowed fieely down her beauteous cheeks.-"What good fortune brought you hither, Frankl.?" "I cannot tell you now; to-morrow, or next day, or perchance the next-for we must part no more, Fleta-I will tell you all." After this ebullition of joy, which was witnessed by Ernest, he re- marked to our hero in rather a jocose manner, and taking him by the hand,-- "I congratulate you upon the success of your enterprise, thus far; and allow me further to say, that, after the happy scene I have just witnessed, I feel amply revenged for your being an eye-witness of a similar scence at Giles Vimmer's inn, in which I was one of the actors." "I am content," said lie; "and if you will but do me the favor to call in my friend, you shall be revenged with compound interest, if the witnessing of scenes of surprise will satisfy you." The young nobleman understood his cue, and hastened out of the house in quest of Fleetwood, whom he found still the close companion of his beautiful cousin, and informed him that his presence was required for a few minutes only, in the library. "Pardon me," said Ernest, to the blushing Minna, "for :causing this brief interruption to a pleasant interview, but I assure you that it is quite necessary. He shall not be detained very long." "Oh, sir, you need not make any apologies," said Minna, poutingly; you must not suppose thatj Ihave the least control over the lieutenant's movements."  "Oh, no, my pretty cousin, I would not dar emake such an insinuation for' a dukedom," replied Ernest, with a slightly satirical laugh; then, taking Fleetwood's arm, they entered the mansion, leaving Minnaa to rejoin her uncle and mother, who had not yet succeeded in assembling the scat- tered party in one social group. Ernest and Fleetwood entered the library, where sat, upon a sofa, Wil. lett and Fleta, in sweet converse. Several years had elapsed since Fleta    <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6930-00000048"/> THE FLYING YANKEE; OR! I her brother had met, and Time had wrought changes in both. They re children then-the sister had grown to lovely womanhood-the )ther had become a man, with as noble a countenance, and with as fine )portions, as any sprig of the nobility of England could boast of. "Fleta," said our hero, as he saw Ernest and Fleetwood entering, "be b epared for another surprise; mark that fine, nobly-appearing fellow,  th the young lord of Woodville." He is, truly, fine-looking," said Fleta, as she fixed her eyes upon the Broaching figure. "Who is he?" Willett answered not. "Ah, that face!" she resumed; "I have seen it before, have I not? a it be possible? It is-it is my brother!" she arose, and rushed to.- Lrds him.                        . Fleetwood was rather staggered in finding himself suddenly embraced  a beautiful female; but he quickly recovered himself, and gazing into r sweetly-expressive face, he recognized her. "Fleta! my long-lost sister! do I dream, or are you, indeed, Fleta eetwood? Among the many surprises of to-day, what next will hap- n  I am astonished to find you in this nobleman's palace!" Ah! my brother," said Fleta, "you cannot be more surprised than    f' m."  "Fleetwood," said Willett; "the only secret which I have kept from u, since our cruise began, is now out." "I comprehend," replied Fleetwood; "it was to seek out my sister?" "That was the great incentive in cruising under a letter-of-marque." "Ah, Fleta, you know not what my noble friend has passed through avenge your wrongs, and to seek you out," remarked Fleetwood. "Rather to avenge my own wrongs," interposed Willett; "for, know u, my friend, that your sister is my betrothed; and, moreover, over   i e death-couch of your poisoned father, I swore ever' to be her protector. iat oath is registered in Heaven! God knows that I have done all in  y power not to forfeit that solemn vow!" "Heaven bless you both!" said Fleetwood. "It will be one of the ppiest moments of my life to witness the consummation of your be. othal!" After the first effects of these, surprises were over, the parties in the Irary rejoined those whom they had somewhat unceremoniously left, d a most delightful evening was passed, without any explanation being  ked, as to the very remarkable fact of there being such an unreserved timacy between at least three of the couples present. It was past the hour of midnight. In a private apartment of the ble mansion, sat Lord Guilford, Lord Woodville, Captain 'Inglefield, cptain Willett, and Lieutenant Fleetwood. The parties were in close nsultation. Our hero had narrated, in a faithful manner, his wrongs . Id those of Fleta; the means he had taken to avenge himself, as well  to. discover the whereabouts of Fleta. Captain Inglefield had also lated a detailed account of his meeting with the gallant Privateersmen i the high seas, and of their generous conduct on that occasion, which ory had been told to Lord Guilford before the arrival of their young Lests, and had been fully corroborated by Myrtilla and Minna, and their other. Ernest, the young lord of Woodville, then told his story: of ie horrible butchery on board of the Indiaman by a band of pirates; 'his being left for dead on the cabin-floor; of the subsequent capture * the pirates by the Flying Yankee, and of his Imilda's rescue, as well   THE CRUISE OF TSEr CLIPPERS.        95 as that of his oskn. In corroboration, he displayed the wounds, now almost healed, that nearly cost him his life. In answer to a question from Fleetwood, Lord Guilford stated the circumstances under which he found -Fleta; that he had ferreted out all the facts concerning her abduction, which would be adduced against the guilty parties, at their trial to come off in a few weeks. "Take' it all in all," remarked the old nobleman, "this is the;most singular concatenation of circumstances that ever came to my know- ledge!" "There s more to come," said Fleetwood, producing a packet of papers, and placi , them before the nobleman ,' "the conitents are partially. from the pirate, under Hawkwing, and the cruiser Kingfisher, under Dashing- ton. If your lordship will take the trouble to' examine these several documents, you will find that. some of his majesty's officers are not less culpable than Hawkwing, or any, of 'his gang of miscreants." "By St. George and the Dragon! here's treason with a vengeance i" exclaimed Lord Gtilford, after ascertaining the imnport of the papers. It appears that the schooner in possession of the Pirates was called the 'Duke of York ;' that she was originally an American Privateer, but was captured by a British squadron, in a calm, almost within the mouth of the Irish Channel. Do I comprehend aright?" "Such are the facts which I gathered from those documents," replied Willett. "Then I will endeavor to state an outline of this diabolical affair, and if I err, please correct me," resumed his lordship. "The schooner Mwas immediately put in commission 'bythe Admiralty to cruise against the Americans; the command given to Lieutenant Blaney, whose first officer was Midshipman Ratsey, his second, Midshipman Lane, and 'the boat- swain's berth was given to -one Gower, alias Hawkwing, who obtained. this post, in consideration that he could add thirty able-bodied seamen to the crew; that, on the second day out, these thirty men, together with several others, headed by Ratsey (a creature of Captain Dashington of the Kingfisher) and HRawkwing, pmtinied; that the commander and second officer were murdered in cold blood ; that a desperate fight ensued between the' mutineers and that portion of the crew who were loyal to their country's flag, in which the latter were overpowered, and those who were not cut down in the engagement were forced to ' walk the plank;' that latsey, who led the mutineers, was run throtgh with a boarding- pike, and thus paid the penalty of his hellish treason . Served him right. Why, this is a most hellish piece of business!" "It is most true," added our hero. "That during the whole tinm 'of this diabolical revolt," continued Guilford,:" his Majesty's brig Kingfisher; of 18 guns, under the c ommand of Captain Dashington, was lying Within gunshot of the schooner;' and, when hailed for assistance, not only absolutely refused, bu t even seemed rather inclined to aid and abet in'the mutiny; that after the schooner was in the complete possession of the mutineers, several kegs and bags of specie were transferred to the brig, as the reward, most-undoubtedly, of their carrying out the principle of non-intervention; that when the brig and schooner parted company, the former raised the meteor flag of ()ld England, and the other the skull and cross-bone flag of black-hearted buccaneers; and that these ensigns were absolutely dipped to each other in token of amity! Well, this caps the climax! It out-Satans Satan'! Was 'ever our glorious ensign so damnably insulted !" and the old lord brought his fist down upon the table with startling effect. 'But you' 's',l n    <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6930-00000049"/> afterward captured the disgraced Kingfisher and sent her into an Ameri- can port ?" " I did." "And that wretched specimen of humanity, Dashington-did you serve him as you did his piratical compeer, Hawkwing ?" "I did not," answered our hero; "I desired that he should live in order that information mnight be extorted from him; he is now my pris- oner, heavily ironed in the hold of the vessel which I have the honor to, command." "And what is to be his fate ." " Death ! if I am to dispose of him," replied Willett; "he, however, deserves a worse death than I can inflict upon him." " He should be our prisoner,'" remarked Guilfotrd; " place him in my hands, and I assure you, our laws will deal justly with him; I am a ma- gistrate of the shire, and have authority to act in the matter." " On one condition," said our hero, after a moment's reflection. "Name it; if within the bounds of possibility, it shall be complied with." 1" You are well aware, sir, of the great hazard we have run, in ventur- ing boldly to land upon these shores; and, as we wish to avoid all pos- sible interruption on our return, especially as the sister of my friend is to accompany us, I ask for a safe conduct during to-morrow night to the mouth of the river Ouse, and in two hours afteriwards I promise there to deliver into your hands, the prisoner Dashington, together with three of his crew, who will fully corroborate the authenticity of those documents, as well as the statements which I have made, so far as they were cogni- zant of the facts." " Your request shall be complied with, and should be, unconditionally, as far as in my power lies," replied Guilford; " you have, sir, permit me to say, performed for the British nation a most important piece of ser- vice in the capture of those outlawed vessels, and 1 regret that the pres- ent position of English and American affairs is not at present such, as to enable you to leave these shores without the least liability to molest, ation ; but I think I have it in my power to afford you protection to the coast; after that you must run your own hazard in getting safely out of the English Channel; and if, in the future, my services can be of any aid to you or your friends, do not hesitate to command them. But, gen. tlemen, we are going into the small hours of the night, and we need a few hours' repose. To-morrow, matters shall be arranged." Our hero thanked the generous nobleman for his willingness to aid him, and then the party separated for the night, or rather for the morning. We must now pass over the preliminaries for departure, made on the succeeding day; and the many regrets, made by Lord Guilford and his daughter, that the beloved Fleta was soon to be taken from them; as well as the mutual progress made in love by Fleetwood and Minna; and of other minor matters which occurred; but let us look only to the results of that day's business. In the evening, just after the twilight shades had deepened into night, a large, open carriage left the manor of Guilford, and taking a road leading in a southerly direction, rolled on at a rapid rate. The carriage con- tained four persons, viz.: the Lord Guilford, Willett, Fleetwbod and his sister. After a ride of some two hours, and just before entering the little town at the mouth of the Ouse, they encountered a body of mounted troops, who seemed to be guarding the avenues to the town.    ^. . uJ is OF THE CLIPPERS.        97 The carrage was stopped, and an officer riding up, stated that their: orders were, to let no one pass, during t'he night, to or frotm the town. "Whoe is-your commander?" asked Lord Guilf or Sir George Lanmere."  'Ah! we know him well. Send us to him          . issionl to pass on my ju"ry, 'without interrupti on."

The two vessels had, as soon as it grew dark on that evening, come out from their hiding- places, and while lying-to off the mouth of the Ouse, had put their top- hamper in the same condition as it was before they lhad sought a haven in the little inlet. They now stood off towards the French coast close- hauled, the wind blowing in'mloderately from the see. It had become known throughout the entire fleet of his Britannic Majesty, cruising in the English Channel, that two American Privateers- men had gone up towards the Strait of Dover. and that it was equally certain they had not succeeded in running through the "Chops" into the North Sea, as such a feat could not well have been performed, either by night or by day, without discovery on account of the many British vessels on the look-out, and forming nearly a complete line across the navigable parts of the Straits. It was almost equally certain, too, that they had not come down the Channel, west of the Isle of Wight. The British commanders, therefore, felt sanguine of their having entrapped "The Flying Yankee," as well as her consort. The ports on the French coast were looked into at no little risk, and cruisers were stationed at conveni- ent distances in a line, reaching front the Isle of Wight southwardly, nearly to the French coast. It must be confessed that our Yankee friends, to use a vulgar expression, were in ' a tight place," and would seem to require something more than Yankee ingenuity to get safely out of it. On the following morning, after leaving the mouth of the Ouse, the two clippers were off Duntroon Castle, nearly within reach of the ranm- part guans. The wind had veered round to the south, enabling them to lay their course westwardly along the French coast. It must be remem- bered that, at this period, England was at war with France, as well as with our own country, but that amicable relations existed between France and the United States. The two American Privateers, however, N\ithin view of the castle, and also within view of two French frigates in the harbor of Dieppe, ran up the English flag, as if challenging the F}renchmen to come out and fight them. The two frigates immediately got under weigh, and came out of the harbor to punish the conmparatively inferior force for their temerity. But no sooner were they fairly outside, and all their canvas spread, and bearing down upon the bold little challengers, like a pair of vultures upon a pair of swallows, than the two schooners, as if by magic, crowded on all sail, as if they desired to avoid the engagement. This fact increased the desire of the Frenchmen to overhaul them, and a chase commenced,--all four of the vessels hugging pretty closely the French coast. In order to keep just outside of the range of the frigates' bow-chasers, the pursued vessels were compelled several times to shorten sail, and then again would hoist every rag and forge far ahead. A fewt hours brought the pursued and pursuers down opposite Brest, when the former again shortened sail, and allowed the latter to come within range. Now, a cannonading commenced on the part of the firigates, which was returned by the schooners with blank cartridges! At this particular juncture, and .almost simultan'eously, a fleet of Eng- lish cruisers came bearing up, for the purpose of cutting off the supposed British vessels from their formidable pursuers, and a fleet of French ves- sels came out from Brest, for the opposite purpose of affording them pro. tection. A battle immediately ensued between the fleets of the two   great'po'w-ers Of -Rur9pe,; but the F- s          .
