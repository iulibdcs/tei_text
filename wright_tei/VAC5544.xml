               <head type="sub">FLEMING'S HOTEL.</head>
               <p>IN THE year 1785, as, also, prior and subsequent to that time, there was a hotel
                  situated in one of the less frequented streets of Pittsburg, then the largest town
                  west of the mountains, and kept by one Fleming, whence it derived the name of
                  "Fleming's Hotel." This house, a small one, and indifferently furnished, was a
                  favorite resort of the Indians who visited the town on trading expeditions.
                  Fleming had two daughters, who possessed considerable personal attractions, and
                  that pride of a vain woman—<emph>beauty</emph>. History does not, to the best of
                  our knowledge, give us the first names of the two girls; and we will distinguish
                  them as Eliza and Sarah. Unfortunately for these young females, they had ever been
                  surrounded by unfavorable circumstances, and exposed to the vices of bad
                  associations; and that nice discrimination between propriety and politeness, which
                  is a natural characteristic of the modest woman, had become somewhat obliterated,
                  and the hold which virtue ever has by nature in the heart of the gentler sex, had
                  been somewhat loosened. In short, the young Misses Flemming failed at all times to
                  observe that degree of propriety which should ever characterize the pure in heart,
                  and were, by many, accused of immorality. How far this accusation was true, we
                  shall not attempt to say, but, doubtless, there were not wanting many tongues to
                  spread slanderous reports.</p>
               <p>In early years of womanhood, Eliza had given her affections to one who sought her
                  love under the guise of a "gentleman of fortune." He proved to be what such
                  characters usually are—a libertine, whose only motive in seeking to win her
                  confidence and<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC5544-00000004"/> young affections was to
                  gratify his hellish passions in the ruin of virtue and a good name. Under the most
                  solemn assurances of deep, abiding, unalterable love for her, and the most solemn
                  promises of marriage at an early day, which if he failed to perform, the direst
                  maledictions of heaven, and the most awful curses, were called down upon his own
                  head, even to the eternal consuming of his soul in the flames of perdition, he
                  succeeded in his design. Virtue was overcome, and the jewel of purity departed
                  from the heart of another of earth's daughters. Vain were the tears of the
                  repentant girl to induce a performance of the promises so solemnly made; false had
                  been and still were the vows of the profligate; but he continued to make them all
                  the more profusely; and hope, at first unwavering, then fainter and fainter,
                  filled the heart of his victim. Once conquered, and the victory was ever after
                  comparatively easy; and having taken something of a fancy to this lady, he was for
                  a long time attached to her, and, in his way, remained faithful.</p>
               <p>Such were the mutual relations sustained by these two toward each other, when, one
                  day, the betrayer entered the presence of the betrayed, and, in some agitation,
                  said:</p>
               <p>"Eliza, my dear, you have always been a kind, dear girl to me, and I have resolved
                  to repay your constancy and devotion by making you my bride in a few days; but
                  first I must demand of you a service, an important service. Can I depend on
                  you?"</p>
               <p>"You know you can; let me know how I can aid you in such a manner as will insure
                  me your hand, and I will serve you unto death."</p>
               <p>"Bravely spoken! Just what I expected of your devoted love! But the service I
                  shall require will sorely try that love!"</p>
               <p>"Then let me prove its strength."</p>
               <p>"Eliza, do you doubt my truth? my sincerity?"</p>
               <p>"Have I not given you stronger proof than a thousand asseverations, or the
                  strongest oaths, that my confidence is unbounded? Without this trust, I should be
                  wretched beyond endurance!"</p>
               <p>"I am glad to hear you talk so. Still I fear you will not consent to serve me as I
                  shall wish."</p>
               <p>"Try me and see."</p>
               <p>"Are you of a <emph>jealous</emph> disposition, my love?"</p>
               <p>"Jealous? What a question for <emph>you</emph> to ask!"</p>
               <p>"It may appear strange, yet I would be pleased to have you answer me truly, and
                  without reserve. Tell me your real sentiments without reserve or disguise. Much
                  depends thereon."</p>
               <p>"Truly, I cannot say, never having been tried; but I can verily believe that
                  intense hatred would arise in my heart toward one of my sex who would attempt to
                  supplant me in your affections."</p>
               <p>"Suppose I should disregard their efforts, what then?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing. If sure of your attachment, I would care for nothing beside."</p>
               <p>"'Tis well! But suppose that I should tell you that I once loved another than
                  you?"</p>
               <p>"As you love me?"</p>
               <p>"No; with a boyish affection, soon forgotten."</p>
               <p>"Then I would care nothing for it."</p>
               <p>"Not if it left an incurable wound?"</p>
               <p>"Did it?"</p>
               <p>"It did!"</p>
               <p>"My God! How have I been deceived."</p>
               <p>"Don't be alarmed, my dear, the wound was not in the heart—it was in pride."</p>
               <p>"How?"</p>
               <p>"I was not troubled at heart, but the girl I fancied gave me mortal offense, and I
                  would be revenged!"</p>
               <p>"How so? What is this? Don't love, and wish revenge! Revenge for what? And that
                  dark frown—what means all this?"</p>
               <p>"Be calm; you are excited; you fear my truth; and where there is no confidence,
                  love soon departs. I can soon explain all. In my young days I fell in love with a
                  beautiful girl of my own age; but soon learned that she was not virtuous, and with
                  this knowledge my love changed into desire. As the least return for my love, to
                  gain which she had recourse to all the wiles and blandishments of a coquette, I
                  wished to possess her for a time; but she spurned me from her presence as she
                  would a dog! From that hour I have sworn to have my revenge and gain my point.<pb
                     n="12-13" xml:id="VAC5544-00000005"/> My hour has now come, and I can
                  accomplish my oath, provided I am secure of one thing."</p>
               <p>"And what is that?"</p>
               <p>"Your co-operation."</p>
               <p>"Me aid in such a scheme!"</p>
               <p>"Why not?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Why not?</emph> Shall I turn the enemy of my own sex, and aid in the
                  destruction of one who has never injured me?"</p>
               <p>"She <emph>has</emph> injured you."</p>
               <p>"In what way?"</p>
               <p>"By destroying, in a good degree, my confidence in the sex. Had that confidence
                  been unshaken, you would, long ere this time, have been my wife; but how could I
                  trust my happiness with woman when woman had proved treacherous? I had been once
                  deceived, and distrust had taken the place of faith, when I met you. You know the
                  result. Now tell me, has not this girl injured you deeply?"</p>
               <p>"It may be so; but why not let her go? What good can it do to pursue her with
                  vengeance? Perhaps she has repented. How wicked, then, to destroy her peace of
                  mind."</p>
               <p>"Dream not that such as she will ever repent. But to satisfy you on this point, I
                  can say, <emph>I know she has not changed from what she was;</emph> and it is this
                  knowledge that, above all things, urges me on in my plans."</p>
               <p>"Well, what do you wish me to do?"</p>
               <p>"Listen. I have just learned that this girl, in company with her family, will be
                  in town to-day, on their way to Ohio or Kentucky, and will put up at this house.
                  Now I wish you to so place the young lady, that I can have access to her sleeping
                  apartment; this is all."</p>
               <p>"I cannot do it."</p>
               <p>"You can; I will take number eighteen for the night; put her in seventeen, and it
                  is all I ask. I am sure this is easily done."</p>
               <p>"I tell you she is already dishonored; and instead of bringing shame upon
                  yourself, you take it away forever."</p>
               <p>"Do not tempt me to do wrong! Alas, I have done too much evil already! I pray God
                  I may be forgiven!"</p>
               <p>"Come, now, be a good girl, and do me this <emph>one</emph> favor; it is the last
                  I shall require of you until I give you my name."</p>
               <p>"I cannot. Such conduct would disgrace our house."</p>
               <p>"It need not be known."</p>
               <p>"It is hard to prevent such things being spread abroad."</p>
               <p>"I will take care of that point. Your house shall not be injured one particle by
                  the occurrence, I give you my word for it. Now do you consent?"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you still love this girl, and are trying to deceive me."</p>
               <p>"I swear that I do not, that I love only you."</p>
               <p>"Why, then, seek, the society of this other?"</p>
               <p>"I have sworn it, as I have already told you; and this oath <emph>must</emph> be
                  performed. Will you aid me or not?"</p>
               <p>"I cannot. I pray you again, do not tempt me!"</p>
               <p>"But you <emph>must</emph> help me. I cannot do without you."</p>
               <p>"For God's sake say no more! Every feeling of my heart revolts at the thought!
                  Just think, for a moment, what it is you ask of me! Think what would be my
                  feelings! Love is incompatible with your request. How can I see you debase
                  yourself and me by such an act?"</p>
               <p>"I only desire you to decide between this and a worse debasement. Which will you
                  choose?"</p>
               <p>"What mean you?"</p>
               <p>"That I will only marry you on condition you will accede to my present

               <p>"Have you not told me, time and again, that you looked upon me as your wife by the

                  making me legally yours, in, the sight of men?"</p>
               <p>"I will, I tell you, if you will do as I wish in the present instance. Come, be
                  kind, be gentle and loving, as you ever have been, and we will soon be completely
                  happy by acknowledging our love before men, at the altar."</p>

               <p>"Oh, God! I am in your power!"</p>
               <p>"Then you consent?"</p>
               <p>"What assurance have I that this promise will make me your wife? Have you not

               <head type="sub">A VILLAIN UNMASKED.</head>
               <p>IN A beautiful district of the "Old Dominion," bordering on the Rappahannock,
                  there lived, just previous to the time of the opening of our story, a planter, who
                  had once been wealthy, but whose princely fortune had become much reduced by
                  indiscriminate kindness. Possessed of a noble heart, a generous disposition, and
                  the finest sympathies, he could never find it in his heart to say "no" to an
                  application for assistance. Thousands had thus gone to pay debts of security; and,
                  at last, he resolved to move to the West, as a means of retrieving his affairs, as
                  well as to cut loose from the associations which were rapidly diminishing the
                  remains of his wealth.</p>
               <p>This planter, whom we shall call General Walton, (the last name assumed, the title
                  one given him by common consent,) had one son, and an only daughter, the former
                  twenty-one, the latter eighteen, at the time we wish to introduce them to the
                  reader's notice. Both were worthy, the one as a man, the other as a woman. He was
                  noble, intellectual, manly; she was beautiful, accomplished, intelligent; both
                  possessed those higher and nobler qualities of mind and heart which dignify and
                  ally it to divinity.</p>
               <p>Ellen Walton, an heiress, jointly with her brother, in prospective, and reputed
                  the wealthiest fair one in all the district, (the world don't always know the true
                  situation of a man's affairs,) was not left to pine away in solitude with the
                  dismal prospect in view of becoming that dreaded personage—<emph>an old
                     maid</emph>. No, she was <emph>beset</emph> with admirers; some loving
                     <emph>her</emph>, some her <emph>wealth</emph>, and some <emph>both</emph>. To
                  all but one she turned a deaf ear; that one, though the least presuming of the
                  many, and too diffident to urge his claim until impelled by the <choice>
                     <sic>irresistable</sic>
                     <corr>irresistible</corr>
                  </choice> violence of his love, possessed, unknown to himself, a magnetic power
                  over the heart of the fair being. Many were the doubts and fears of both—natural
                  accompaniments of true, sincere, devoted, but unacknowledged, love—<pb n="16-17"
                     xml:id="VAC5544-00000007"/> but all were dispelled by the mutual exchange of
                  thoughts, and the mutual plighting of faith. Vows once made by the pure in heart,
                  are seldom, if ever, broken, and then by some higher duty or demand.</p>
               <p>For a time the youthful lovers were happy—happy in themselves, and the joys of,
                  the new existence opened up to them by the magic wand of LOVE. But love has its
                  trials, as all can testify who have tasted its potency in the heart; and so these
                  two learned. Their engagement was a family secret, not yet to be developed. Hence,
                  many of her admirers still offered their attentions, in the vain hope of ultimate
                  success. Particularly was this the case with those who had an eye to the fortune
                  rather than the heiress, taking the latter as the only means of obtaining the
                  former; and first among this number was Louis Durant, a man of corrupt principles,
                  and deeply depraved feelings. A sprig of a noble family of small pretensions,
                  whose pride far, exceeded their means, he was desirous of obtaining wealth; and
                  being too indolent to enter a profession, too poor to become a merchant, and too
                  proud to work, as a last resort, he wished to <emph>marry</emph> a fortune. Like
                  most of, his class, he was unscrupulous as to <emph>means</emph> so the
                     <emph>end</emph> was attained. It was, therefore, an easy matter to conform, in
                  outward appearance, to the society he was in. This he never failed to do. When
                  with the Waltons, he was a pattern of generosity, and a pitying angel. When with
                  the gambler, or the <emph>roue</emph>, he was equally at home—a debauchee, or a
                  handler of cards.</p>
               <p>With the intuitive perception of woman, Ellen saw through his character at once;
                  and, though she treated him with civility, never gave him any encouragement.
                  Blinded by her fortune, and construing her reserve into the bashfulness of a first
                  passion, being too vain to acknowledge the inability of his powers of fascination
                  to carry all before them;, he gave himself up to hope, and already counted on the
                  half of the Walton estate as his own, and spent many a shilling of his small funds
                  on the strength of the anticipation.</p>
               <p>When he saw that the bottom of his purse would soon be reached, he sought an
                  opportunity, declared himself in love, and asked the hand of Miss Walton. The
                  General to whom he had always appeared a "fine fellow," would leave his daughter
                  to decide the matter. Thus referred, he lost no time in making Ellen the recipient
                  of his "tale of love." All his theatrical powers were called in action; his
                  eloquence commanded; but the impressions made were far different from those
                  intended. Though the outward semblance was complete, Ellen saw that the passion
                  was feigned, and a still deeper dislike took possession of her feelings. But with
                  gentle delicacy, she told him his passion was not returned.</p>
               <p>"Then," said he, "let me win your love. I am sure your heart will yield when you
                  are convinced of the depth of the devotedness of my affection."</p>
               <p>"Do not flatter yourself with a vain hope. I feel that I shall never be able to
                  love you; and it is in kindness that I tell you so at once."</p>
               <p>"Ah, adorable, angelic being! One so kind, so considerate, so good, is too pure,
                  too near akin to heaven, for man to possess. I only ask to be your friend."</p>
               <p>"As such, you shall ever be welcome."</p>
               <p>"Thanks! thanks! May I but prove worthy of your friendship!"</p>
               <p>Thus terminated his first attempt to win Ellen. His fall from the lover to a
                  friend was the first step in a plot already matured. As a friend, he could ever
                  have access to the heiress, and be received more familiarly than in any other
                  capacity, save as an acknowledged lover. This familiarity would give him the
                  opportunity of ingratiating himself into her affections, of which, finally, he
                  felt certain.</p>
               <p>He became a constant and frequent visitor at the mansion of The Waltons, and was
                  ever received with cordiality. He let no opportunity pass unimproved to carry out
                  his design. Goodness, benevolence, charity, were counterfeited most adroitly,
                  until even Ellen began to think` he had done him injustice by her suspicions. This
                  is a favorable moment for a lover. Prove that you have been dealt with unjustly,
                  and a woman's heart is opened by sympathy to let you in. It was well for Ellen
                  that her heart was already occupied, or this might possibly have been her fate.
                     As<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC5544-00000008"/> it was, she became, insensibly and
                  unintentionally, kind to Durant, He did not fail to notice the change, and his
                  heart exulted in the prospect of complete success.</p>
               <p>When he thought the proper time had arrived, he prepared the way, and again
                  declared himself a lover, with more eloquence than before. Again his suit was
                  gently declined; but this time he persevered until his importunities became
                  unbearable, and with them, all Ellen's old prejudices returned, strengthened
                  tenfold. If he could and would force himself for weeks and months upon an
                  unwilling victim of his importunities, and attempt by such means to force her to
                  accept his hand, he was depraved enough for any other wickedness. So she plainly
                  told him she could not and would not submit longer to his unreasonable conduct;
                  that he must consider himself as finally, fully and unrecallably dismissed.</p>
               <p>"And give up all hope—the hope that has sustained and given me life so long? Oh,
                  think, Ellen, think of my misery, of the untold wretchedness into which you plunge
                  me, and let your heart, your kind, generous heart, relent!"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Durant, I have told you often and often that it was impossible for me to love
                  you, and that it was kindness to tell you so. If you have disregarded my oft
                  repeated declaration, the truth of which you must long ere this have been
                  convinced, the fault is yours, not mine."</p>
               <p>"I know you have so spoken often, but still I have dared to hope. I loved too
                  fervently for the passion ever to die before you denied me hope. Think of all
                  these things, and then recall your words."</p>
               <p>"You have repeated them so frequently, that I could not well avoid thinking of
                  them whether I chose to or not. Let me now say, once for all, that importunities
                  are utterly useless, and can prove of no avail."</p>
               <p>"Then I am to understand you as casting me off from your presence; and this being
                  the <emph>end</emph> of your kindness, may I ask what was the <emph>object</emph>
                  of that kindness?"</p>
               <p>"I always endeavor to do unto others as I would have them do to me. If you think
                  such a course wrong, I cannot help it."</p>
               <p>"Then you would wish some person, who had the power, to show you all manner of
                  good will, until your affections were won, and so firmly fixed as to be
                  unalterable, and then cast you off?"</p>
               <p>"No, I should be far from desiring such conduct on the part of any one."</p>
               <p>"And yet that is your way of 'doing as you would be done by!'"</p>
               <p>"I am not aware of ever having done so; if I have been the unwitting instrument of
                  such acts, I am truly sorry for it."</p>
               <p>"Then let your sorrow work repentance."</p>
               <p>"Tell me how, and I will try to do so."</p>
               <p>"You cannot be ignorant of my meaning."</p>
               <p>"I am totally at a loss to know how your remarks can apply to me, in any way."</p>
               <p>"Then I will speak plainly. Your actions for the last few months have been such as
                  to bid me hope for a return of my love, and allured by that hope, founded on those
                  actions, I have placed my affections so strongly, that I fear it will be death to
                  tear them away. As you have caused me to love, is it demanding more than justice
                  that I should ask you to at least <emph>try</emph> to love me in return?"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Durant, you know that your accusations are untrue. Did you not just tell me
                  that you loved before you ever spoke to me on the subject? and have you not
                  repeatedly, aye, a hundred times, told me I was cold toward you, ever evincing a
                  want of cordiality? How, then, can you have the face to ask a return of love on
                  this score? Since you have been at such pains to make out so contradictory a case,
                  I will say that you but lessen yourself in my esteem by the attempt!"</p>
               <p>"I see, alas, you are a heartless coquette!"</p>
               <p>"Because I will not place the half of my father's wealth in your possession. I
                  have read your motive from the beginning, sir, and have only refrained from
                  telling you my mind, because I make it a rule to have the good will of a dog, in
                  preference to his ill will, when I can. But as your conduct to-day has removed the
                  last thin screen from your real character, and revealed your<pb n="20-21"
                     xml:id="VAC5544-00000009"/> naked depravity of heart, I care not even for your
                  friendship. You know, you <emph>feel</emph>, that you are a degraded wretch; and
                  that you are unworthy of the society,of the virtuous."</p>
               <p>"Madam, those words just spoken have sealed your fate! Dog as I am, I have the
                  power to work your ruin, and <emph>I will do it!</emph> I go from your presence a
                  bitter and unrelenting foe! The love you have rejected has turned into bitterness,
                  and the dregs of that bitterness you shall drink till your soul sickens unto
                  death! I will never lose sight of you! Go where you may, I will follow you! Hide
                  in what corner of the world you may, I will find you! When you meet me, remember I
                  am an implacable enemy, seeking revenge!"</p>
               <p>"Go, vile miscreant, from my presence! Think not to intimidate me. Better an 'open
                  enemy than a secret foe.- I am glad you have unmasked yourself so fully. Now I
                  know that I have escaped the worst fate on earth."</p>
               <p>"Not the worst! To be the wife of even a villain is better than to be his
                  victim!"</p>
               <p>"Leave my presence, sir, or I will call a slave to put you out! Infamous wretch!
                  The curse of God be upon you!"</p>
               <p>He went, quailing, under the flash of her indignant eye, which made his guilty
                  soul cower in abasement.</p>
               <p>When he was fairly gone, her high strung energies relaxed, and the reaction
                  prostrated her strength. She sunk upon a lounge, and, giving way to her feelings,
                  exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"That man may yet work the ruin of my happiness! Oh, God, pity me, and let not the
                  wicked triumph! In Thee I put my trust. Let thy watchful eye be over me, and thy
                  power protect me. Oh, let me not fall into the hands of my enemy; but preserve me
                  by thy right hand, and keep me lifted up!"</p>
               <p>Prayer gave her strength, and renewed her courage. Relying, with firm faith, on
                  the goodness and watchful care of her Father in heaven, she became .cheerful and
                  composed.</p>
               <p>She very seldom, saw or heard anything of Durant, but when, she did, it always
                  awakened fear. For a year she heard nothing of him, and, at last, the old dread
                  had passed from her heart, when her father prepared to go to the West.</p>
               <p>As for Durant, he went from her presence muttering curses and threatening
                  vengeance, among which was distinguished by a slave, grated out between his
                  clenched teeth, "I'll make her repent this day's work in 'sack-cloth and ashes!-
                  aye, if all h—ll oppose!"</p>

                  destruction of Ellen Walton when he so earnestly desired the a assistance of Miss
                  Fleming; and it will now be perceived how false were his statements in relation to
                  the <emph>character</emph> of the expected guest. Though unseen himself, he had
                  taken every precaution to make certain of the party at the Fleming Hotel; and just
                  at the close of day he had the satisfaction of seeing his efforts crowned with
                  success. General Walton, influenced by the tales his daughter's foe had, whispered
                  to him in confidence, passed by the more elegant houses, which, but for defaming
                  reports; he would have preferred making his abode during his short stay in the
                  place, and took lodgings at the "Eliza."</p>
               <p>Eliza Fleming made the acquaintance of her young female guest, and every fresh
                  insight into Miss Walton's character made her regret the hard necessity she was
                  under of doing her an injury. She had a hard struggle in her mind, but at length
                  her determination was fixed. To procure the ruin of the innocent guest, (for she
                  had thoroughly satisfied herself that Miss Walton <emph>was</emph> innocent and
                  virtuous,) whom every obligation of hospitality required her to protect, was
                  indeed damnable; but to forfeit the hand of Durant under the circumstances was
                  impossible, and not to be thought of. Poor Ellen! Heaven shield thee!</p>
               <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC5544-00000010"/>
               <p>Durant was not seen by any of the Waltons, as it was his object to keep them in
                  entire ignorance of his proximity until such time as he chose to reveal himself.
                  Miss Fleming knew where to find him; and, according to agreement, met him during
                  the evening, to arrange some matters connected with the plot.</p>
               <p>"Louis, you have required too much at my hands in this affair. I fear I shall not
                  be able to comply with the terms of agreement."</p>
               <p>"Then return my written promise of marriage, and live to be despised and a by-word
                  among men! I thought the matter was definitely settled, and that you had resolved
                  to save your own honor and name at every hazard."</p>
               <p>"But is this my only hope?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, as true as there is a God in heaven, it is. I will forsake you forever
                  unless you comply with my wishes in this affair."</p>
               <p>"Then I must name some conditions, to which I shall demand the strictest
                  compliance on your part."</p>
               <p>"Name them."</p>
               <p>"In the first place, then, to avoid the possibility of noise or mishap, I will
                  give the lady a potion, which will stupefy her faculties, and cause a deep sleep
                  to lock up all her senses for the space of three or four hours. I will so arrange
                  it, that these hours shall be from eleven to three o'clock, and what is done must
                  be accomplished between those periods of time. You shall, therefore, not enter
                  number seventeen until after eleven o'clock, and you must positively leave it
                  before three; and you shall not let your victim know what transpires at this house
                  until after the Waltons have left the city. Do you consent to these terms?"</p>
               <p>"I suppose I must."</p>
               <p>"Then the matter is settled. Remember the hours; I shall know if my injunctions
                  are disregarded, and you will fare the worse for it."</p>
               <p>"Fear not. Come to reflect, I like your plan better than my own, as there is less
                  danger in it every way."</p>
               <p>"Enough. Good night."</p>
               <p>"Hold a moment. Is there any fastening on the door between the rooms, on the hide
                  in number seventeen?"</p>
               <p>"There is; but I will take care of that; and you know no one, unless well
                  acquainted with the spot, could tell there was a door there."</p>
               <p>"True, true—I had forgotten that fact."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I forgot one prohibition. You must in no case let a ray of light into
                  seventeen. It might render all our precautions abortive, and defeat their
                  object."</p>
               <p>"Very well. I will be careful."</p>
               <p>"Do so, and all will be well. Of course, no noise, even as loud as a whisper, must
                  be heard in the lady's room."</p>
               <p>"I will be discreet; trust me for that. I am glad you have come to the rescue; I
                  find there is nothing like a woman's wit."</p>
               <p>"Take care, then, that you are never <emph>outwitted</emph> by them!"</p>
               <p>"Not much fear of that while I have such an ingenious ally!"</p>
               <p>"Take good care to keep her an ally; as an enemy, she might be equally
                  ingenious."</p>
               <p>And so they parted. As she left the room, she mentally exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"'Come to the rescue!' Yes, I am truly glad I have!"</p>
               <p>The guests retired to their beds, and all was still as the solemn silence of
                  midnight. The old clock in the corner tolled the hour of eleven, and half an hour
                  afterward, a stealthy tread might have been heard along the partition dividing the
                  two rooms already named. Soon a door slowly opened on its rusty hinges, and in the
                  rayless darkness Durant entered the number containing his victim. He reached the
                  couch, and paused to assure himself that all was as he desired. His ear was
                  saluted with a heavy breathing, as of one in deep sleep.</p>
               <p>"All right!" he muttered within himself. "My hour has come. The vengeance of the
                     '<emph>dog</emph>' shall be complete! Oh, but how I will glory in
                     <emph>my</emph> triumph, and the proud one's disgrace! I'll make her
                     <emph>feel</emph> what it is to insult a nobleman by blood! Gods, how the
                  memory burns my brain of that indignity! An unknown girl to scorn and cast
                  contumely upon one of England's line of lords! This night be the stain wiped
                  out!"</p>
               <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC5544-00000011"/>
               <p>Lost! lost! <emph>lost</emph> demon! from thy presence we turn away! Villain and
                  victim, there is a God above!</p>
               <milestone n="*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>The morning dawned, and the sun rose as cloudless as though no deeds of crime,
                  needing the darkness to cover them, had been perpetrated on the earth. The Waltons
                  left with the company they expected to join at Pittsburg on the succeeding day,
                  not knowing that Durant had slept under the same roof with them. No, not so fast.
                  One of their number <emph>did</emph> know the fact—Ellen. Was it that knowledge
                  that caused the paleness on her cheek, that aroused the anxious solicitude of her
                  tender and watchful parents?</p>
               <p>"Are you sick, my daughter?" was the mother's affectionate inquiry. But she was
                  cheered by the assurance that there was no serious cause of alarm; and that Ellen
                  was only a little unwell. Without any mishap, they reached their new home in
                  Kentucky.</p>
               <p>Two weeks had passed, and Eliza Fleming was still unmarried. During that time, she
                  had seen Durant but twice, and he appeared desirous of avoiding a private
                  interview. She was not slow to perceive this, and it filled her mind with
                  misgivings of his truth, or the sincerity of his protestations. She demanded an
                  interview; the demand was acceded to; and, she said:</p>
               <p>"Why do you not make arrangements for our approaching marriage? It is surely time
                  you were about it."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no hurry yet," he replied. "There is plenty of time."</p>
               <p>"Plenty of time! Yes, if all that need be done, is to call the minister, and have
                  the ceremony performed! But it strikes me this is <emph>not</emph> all. However,
                  what day have you fixed upon as your choice for the wedding occasion?"</p>
               <p>"I can't say as I have thought upon any day in particular; in fact, the subject
                  had so far escaped my mind, that I had nearly forgotten it entirely."</p>
               <p>"A devoted lover, truly! What am I to think of such unmerited coldness?" and she
                  burst into tears.</p>
               <p>"Come, Eliza, let us understand each other, and be friends."</p>
               <p>"Friends! Is that all?"</p>
               <p>"Lovers, then."</p>
               <p>"Husband and wife, you mean."</p>
               <p>"Lovers only; as we have been."</p>
               <p>"Am I to understand you as saying you will not fulfill your written promise of
                  making me your lawful wife?"</p>
               <p>"You might be farther from the truth.</p>
               <p>"Is this the reward of my devotion? the fruits of my sacrifice? Oh, God, who shall
                  measure the depths of wickedness of a depraved heart? Sir, I shall enforce my
                  rights."</p>
               <p>"You dare not do it."</p>
               <p>"Why not?"</p>
               <p>"The very attempt will ruin yourself, and your father's business; by bringing
                  disgrace upon his house."</p>
               <p>"I see it, sir; but what if I still proceed?"</p>
               <p>"You cannot."</p>
               <p>"I can."</p>
               <p>"On what plan?"</p>
               <p>"On your own written promise."</p>
               <p>"You have no such promise."</p>
               <p>"Do you deny giving it?"</p>
               <p>"I do."</p>
               <p>"Then your own hand-writing will condemn you."</p>
               <p>"Be certain of that before you proceed."</p>
               <p>"You know I <emph>have</emph> such a document.</p>
               <p>"I know you have <emph>not</emph>."</p>
               <p>"Then I will prove it."</p>
               <p>And she went in search of the paper, where she had carefully placed it away. But
                  no paper was to be found! What could have become of it? She returned.</p>
               <p>"Well, let me see your 'document,' as you term it," he said, in a taunting
                  manner.</p>
               <p>"It has been misplaced by some means, but I will find it in time to answer my
                  purpose."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps."</p>
               <p>"Durant, you <emph>know</emph> I have such a paper, and what is the use of denying
                  it?"</p>
               <p>"Again, I repeat, I know no such thing." Then after a pause, he continued: "We
                  might as well understand each other at once."<pb n="26-27 (Illustration) "
                     xml:id="VAC5544-00000012"/> He produced a paper, and went on: "Here, I suppose,
                  is the article you speak of. I see it is in my hand-writing, and lest by any
                  chance it should again fall into your hands, I will destroy it."</p>
               <p>And holding it in the candle, it was soon reduced to ashes. The outwitted girl sat
                  dumb with astonishment, surprise and dismay, and, for several seconds, was
                  speechless. When utterance came, she inquired:</p>
               <p>"How, in the name of reason, did you get that paper in your possession?"</p>
               <p>"I will be frank: I watched you putting it away, and the next day I went and took
                  it."</p>
               <p>"And this is my reward for the signal service you demanded as the price of that
                  written promise?"</p>
               <p>"My continued love will be your reward."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Your</emph> love! Think you, vile miscreant, I would have the base
                  semblance of affection from such a polluted thing as you? No, sir! Now that I see
                  your depravity, worlds would not tempt me to wed you, degraded as I am! How I have
                  remained blinded so long is a mystery I cannot solve, in the overwhelming light of
                  this hour. Thank God, I am even with you!—Yes, thank Him from the bottom of my
                  heart! You have deceived me, but in this instance I am not behind you. Ellen
                  Walton left this house as pure as she entered it! Think you I had no object in all
                  my restrictions of time, of secrecy and darkness? I had. One hour in the society
                  of Miss Walton, convinced me of her unsullied purity, and another of your
                  baseness. I resolved to save her at all hazards; and I did. My only regret
                     <emph>now</emph> is, that I made myself the victim instead of her!"</p>
               <p>H—ll and furies!"</p>
               <p>"Even, am I not?"</p>
               <p>"May the devil take you!"</p>
               <p>"Better take care of the old fellow yourself; and of woman's wit, too!"</p>
               <p>"I'll have my revenge yet. I'll swear that I did stay the night with Ellen,
                  despite your treachery."</p>
               <p>"It will do you no good. My sister gave the young lady an attested certificate,
                  stating that she passed the whole time with<figure>

               <p>"I curse you! Vile, treacherous—"</p>
               <p>"Spare your epithets, inhuman monster! or, by the heavens above us, you leave not
                  this spot alive!"</p>
               <p>And drawing a pistol, which some freak had caused her to conceal in her dress, she
                  made it ready, and, with her finger on the trigger, aimed it at his heart. Like
                  all villains of his caste, he was a coward, and trembled with quaking fear before
                  the flashing eye and resolute look of the excited girl.</p>
               <p>"Now, vile, degraded, polluted <emph>thing</emph>! you go from my presence never
                  to return. Hold! not just yet, I have a parting word to say before you leave. I
                  confess, with self-abasement, that I once loved you, and with deep humiliation,
                  amounting to agony, that that love was the cause of my ruin. The vail is now torn
                  from my eyes, and I behold you as you are, a corrupted, debased, unfeeling demon,
                  in the human form; and I would not even touch you with my finger's end, so deep is
                  my detestation and abhorrence of your depravity! Aye, sir, even for
                     <emph>me</emph> your very touch is defiling! But if ever you whisper a word
                  concerning the relation you once sustained toward <emph>me</emph>, be it but so
                  loud as your breath, I will as surely destroy you as I now stand before you!
                  Remember and beware! for I call God, and angels, and earth to witness this my vow!
                  One so lost as <emph>you</emph>, shall not couple <emph>my</emph> name with
                  his!"</p>
               <p>She paused a moment, as if to collect her energies for a last effort, and then
                  continued:</p>
               <p>"Into the darkness of this moonless, starless, sky-beclouded night, you shall soon

                  buzzard, and the wild beasts of the desert wilderness howl a requiem over your

                  like an incubus, upon your prostituted heart, and may its fangs, charged with
                  burning poison, pierce the very vitals of existence, till life itself shall become
                  a burden and a curse! Go!"</p>
               <p>And he went, with the awful curse ever burning as a flaming fire on the tablet of
                  his memory.</p>

               <head type="sub">MORE VILLAINY.</head>
               <p>FROM the presence of Miss Fleming, Durant went to an obscure old cabin near the
                  river, where be met an accomplice in villainy, a tool of his, by the name of
                  Ramsey, whom he often employed to do hazardous and dirty work, he himself was too
                  cowardly or too <emph>aristocratic</emph> to perform. The object of the present
                  interview was to learn on what boat the Waltons had taken passage. He was scheming
                  again.</p>
               <p>"Ramsey," said he, "what boats have left in the last two weeks to go down the
                  river?"</p>
               <p>"Only three, sir."</p>
               <p>"Three! Did you see them all?"</p>
               <p>"Did you know any of the passengers?"</p>
               <p>"I did. Colonel Thomas Marshall commanded one of the boats, with whom there were a
                  number of Virginians, several of them personally known to me."</p>
               <p>"Was there a family by the name of Walton among them?"</p>
               <p>"Walton—Walton? I don't know them."</p>
               <p>"A father, mother and daughter; the girl eighteen, and uncommonly good
                  looking—present a much richer appearance than is usual with emigrants."</p>
               <p>"I remember them; they went in another boat."</p>
               <p>"Do you think they have reached Maysville yet?"</p>
               <p>"If unusually lucky, they have; but most probably not."</p>
               <p>"Then there is a possibility of their being overtaken, you think?"</p>
               <p>"There <emph>may</emph> be; particularly if any bad luck has attended them."</p>
               <p>"Quick, then, quick! away!—Have the boat decoyed to the shore, and captured by the
                  Indians! You understand, <emph>captured</emph>: the girl must on no account be
                  killed.</p>
               <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC5544-00000015"/>
               <p>"You don't mean that I shall start out to-night in this storm and darkness?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and without a moment's delay. Set the red dogs on the scent—capture the
                  girl, and you shall be rewarded on your own terms. Go, or it will be too
                  late!"</p>
               <p>With some hesitation Ramsey obeyed, and when once in for the business, pushed it
                  forward with all the energy he could master. This fellow was on friendly terms
                  with the: Indians, a band of whom—kind of renegades—whenever he could come across
                  them, would follow his orders, or do his bidding. With a dispatch that would have
                  done credit to the swiftest courier in the days of chivalry, he pushed forward
                  through the wilderness to the usual place of rendezvous of this band, hoping to
                  find and enlist them in the enterprise on hand; but they were absent on some
                  expedition of their own. Not to be discouraged by one disappointment, Ramsey
                  paused only long enough to determine that his expected coadjutors were not to be
                  found in or about their usual lurking place, then continued his course down the
                  Ohio with unabated ardor, and on the second day came in sight of a boat just at
                  dusk of the evening. A momentary scrutiny convinced him that it was the one he was
                  in pursuit of, and he concluded it must have been delayed by some misfortune, as
                  he did not expect to come up to it so soon, if at all. However this might be, one
                  thing was certain, the boat was there, and more still, the crew were careless, a
                  certain sign that they felt secure and free from any dread of danger. So much the
                  better for his purpose, thought the villain.</p>
               <p>Driving on through the forest, at a speed far exceeding the slow motions of the
                  boat, he resolved to collect a body of savages, and intercept the prize. Fortune
                  seemed to favor him; for on the next day he fell in with a large force of
                  warriors, who were "on the war-path," and ready for any work that gave promise of
                  blood, booty, or scalps. They were easily induced to further the designs of
                  Ramsey, of whose character they were well aware; and placing themselves under his
                  guidance, he soon posted them along the banks of the river to watch for the coming
                  boat. At dark it was descried, but being too far out to admit of being attacked,
                  the enemy silently withdrew, and hastening forward, took a second position below
                  the first. This was done several times, and, at last, Ramsey had the satisfaction
                  of seeing the boat near the Ohio shore. When within fifty yards of the bank, the
                  Indians, to the number of several hundred, suddenly came down to the edge of the
                  water, and opened a heavy fire upon the crew.</p>
               <p>The boat was commanded by Captain James Ward—was a crazy old thing, with only a
                  single pine board for a bulwark. The captain was at one oar, and his nephew, a
                  young man, at the other. Knowing that all depended on reaching the middle of the
                  stream, the captain used his best exertions to force the vessel out; but his
                  nephew let go his oar, and took up his gun to fire. As he did so, he was pierced
                  through with a ball, and fell, mortally wounded. His oar dropped into the river;
                  and the exertions of the captain only tended to force the boat nearer the shore.
                  Seeing this, the savages gave a yell of triumph, and prepared to take possession
                  of the prize. Ward, however, seized hold of a board, and with it took the place of
                  his nephew, giving his own oar to one of the men, and made renewed exertions to
                  gain the current, the enemy, meanwhile, pouring upon the crew an incessant volley
                  of balls, thick as the falling hail of the storm, which soon riddled everything
                  above the plank breastwork, and killed or wounded all the horses on board—seven in
                  number.</p>
               <p>During this time most of the crew were too badly frightened to do or be conscious
                  of anything, excepting danger. One large, fat old Dutchman, in particular, was so
                  taken aback, he threw himself down flat, with his face to the deck, hoping thus to
                  escape with his life. Unfortunately for his peace of mind, however, his posterior
                  protuberance was of such enormously aldermanic dimensions, that it projected above
                  the defenses, and became a fine and laughable target for the savage marksmen, who
                  aimed the great majority of their shots thereat. As the bullets tore through the
                  old fellow's unmentionables, and raking his hide, made it smart, he would shift
                  his position, and endeavor to shield himself all over; but it was of no use. In
                  spite of all the efforts he could make, the young <emph>mountain</emph> would
                  remain in view in its exposed<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC5544-00000016"/> situation,
                  to the great annoyance of its owner, and the equally great merriment of the enemy.
                  In this sad predicament the phlegmatic hero of the flesh mountain lay, piteously
                  bemoaning his fate, and cursing his foes.</p>
               <p>As the balls would rake the subnascent appendage, making it twinge with the sharp
                  sting, he would cry out:</p>
               <p>"Oh! oh, Lort! haf' mercy on <emph>me</emph> and <emph>mine</emph>!"</p>
               <p>But his cries availed nothing; and so losing all patience, he raised up his head,
                  and, looking at the enemy, called to them:</p>
               <p>"Oh, now, t'ere! quit t'at tam nonsense, will you?"</p>
               <p>The boat was, finally, saved, with all on board, except the young man and the
                  horses. (For further particulars of this affair, see "Western Adventure," page
                  275-6.)</p>
               <p>Ramsey discovered at the commencement of the fray that this was not the boat he
                  was in quest of, and so, leaving the Indians to accomplish its capture as they
                  pleased, he hastened onward in the hope of still overtaking the right vessel. In
                  this he failed; already had it reached its destination, and the Waltons were in
                  their new home. He returned, and reported his ill success to Durant, who was
                  greatly vexed at the issue of his undertaking, but resolved to renew his efforts
                  to obtain possession of Ellen, or in some way work her ruin.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
               <head type="sub">STILL AT WORK.</head>
               <p>AN EVIL heart, bent on mischief, is never contented in idleness, but, like the
                  volcanic fires, its passions and thirst for revenge, when not in open eruption,
                  are actively at work in secret and darkness, preparing for new outbursts, bearing
                  death along their path, and leaving devastation, blight and ruin in their wake.
                  This was much the case with' Louis Durant, after the failure of his attempt on the
                  boat. He was resolved to accomplish the villainy on which he had set his heart,
                  and to this end determined to leave no means untried, be they ever so base, which
                  lay within his reach.</p>
               <p>To proceed openly, however, was not exactly practicable, as by so doing too many
                  eyes would be upon him; and he was too cowardly to face an open foe on fair
                  ground. So he went to work in secret.</p>
               <p>After mature deliberation, and the revolving and the re-revolving of the matter in
                  his mind, he concluded to join the Indians, and through their aid accomplish the
                  consummation of his designs. In carrying out this plan, he was very materially
                  aided by his old accomplice in crime, Ramsey, whose familiarity with the red men
                  gave him at once the facilities for introducing his friend to their notice, which
                  he did with a flourish and eulogium. Things went on smoothly enough while Durant
                  was learning the language, customs, manners and habits of his new allies. He had
                  as much as he could do to convince them of his bravery and undaunted courage,
                  which qualities, believing he was deficient in them, they as often as possible put
                  to the test. In many of these adventures he barely came off with credit whole, a
                  thing he found absolutely necessary to maintain any kind of credit with this
                  singular people, and, for this purpose, he called into action every particle of
                  courage from every crack and crevice of his system, and brought the hole to bear
                  upon one point, the wavering of his own heart,<pb n="36-37 (Illustration) "
                     xml:id="VAC5544-00000017"/> and, with it, the staying of his almost quaking
                  limbs, and ready-to-run-away feet. He had just "<foreign xml:lang="LAT">quantum
                     sufficit</foreign>" for this purpose, and <emph>none to spare</emph>.</p>
               <p>These achievements occupied about two years in their accomplishment, at the end of
                  which period, Durant, having established himself pretty fairly in the good graces
                  of his -red brethren, felt as though the time had arrived for him to put in
                  execution his long intended project; for, be it known, his desire for vengeance
                  had neither slumbered nor died during the two years, but was the grand moving
                  impulse to every important act. These years, so full of restrained wrath on his
                  part, were years of peace to his intended victim. Ellen Walton, save the fear of
                  Indians, and the usual trials incident to pioneer life, had spent her time in
                  hopeful quiet, full of love's anticipated bliss in the bright
                  <emph>future</emph>.</p>
               <p>Almost had she forgotten Durant and his threats. Pity she should ever be awakened
                  from her blissful dreams to dread reality.</p>
               <p>Very early in the spring of 1787, and not quite two years since her father's
                  settlement in the country, on a very pleasant day, she ventured to walk out a
                  short distance into the forest, which adjoined their dwelling. Becoming interested
                  in her own musings, she sat down on the trunk of a fallen tree, to give free vent
                  and wide range to her thoughts. The reader can, doubtless, imagine as well as we,
                  the rainbow hues of her straying fancy, as it reveled in the rosy bowers of
                  love.</p>
               <p>"Miss Walton, I believe I have the honor of addressing."</p>
               <p>At the sound of her name, Ellen sprung to her feet, with a suppressed scream of
                  fright on her lips. Looking up, she saw a tall, dark man standing before her, his
                  eye bent upon hers with a look that sent the blood to her heart, she hardly knew
                  why; for certainly the individual before her was a stranger, or one with whom she
                  had had so slight an acquaintance, as to remember nothing concerning him. While
                  her mind was running over all the passing acquaintances she had ever made, and
                  endeavoring among them to put the personage before her, he continued to scan her
                  countenance with a steady gaze, as if to read her thoughts, which divining, he
                  continued:</p>
               <p>
                  <figure>
                     <head>"Looking up, she saw a tall, dark man standing before her, his eye bent
                        upon hers with a look that sent the blood to her heart."—See page
                        36."</head>
                  </figure>
               </p>
               <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC5544-00000018"/>
               <p>"I perceive you do not remember me, though we have met before. My memory is, not
                  so treacherous; and, beside, your looks made a lasting impression on my mind, an
                  impression that time can never efface or obliterate; and to this impression you
                  are indebted for my present visit—an unceremonious one, I must confess."</p>
               <p>At this point of his discourse Ellen made a movement as if to retrace her steps
                  homeward, seeing which, he went on:</p>
               <p>"Do not be impatient, fair maiden, or in haste to go, for I have that to tell thee
                  which is of the utmost importance both to thy present and future welfare."</p>
               <p>This adoption of the familiar and solemn style of address, had the effect rather
                  to increase than diminish the tremors about the girl's heart; yet she silently
                  awaited his words:</p>
               <p>"I am come to warn thee that great, very great and imminent danger is hanging,
                  impended but by a thread, over thy head."</p>
               <p>This blunt and unexpected announcement caused Ellen to start with a shudder, and
                  sent the blood still more forcibly upon her heart, which labored, for a moment,
                  under the load, and then beat so loud she was afraid the stranger would hear it.
                  Noticing the effect of his words, he continued:</p>
               <p>"Thou hast an enemy, a bitter enemy, who has sworn to do thee an evil, and it is
                  in his heart to keep the oath. I see by the pallor of thy countenance thou hast
                  not forgotten him."</p>
               <p>And true it was that the mention of "an enemy" called up her old foe to the most
                  vivid recollection of the now thoroughly alarmed Ellen. With the utmost exertion
                  of her strength and will, she could barely suppress the outward manifestations of
                  her terror.</p>
               <p>"Well, this enemy, whom you had well-nigh forgotten, has never, for a single day,
                  had thee out of his mind. Ever since his threat, he has been laying deep schemes
                  to ruin thee, and once very nearly succeeded, For two years he has been at work in
                  a new way; his plans are about matured, and <emph>you will soon be in his
                     power</emph>.</p>
               <p>This last clause was spoken slowly, and emphasized on every word. All the time he
                  was speaking, Ellen's feelings became<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC5544-00000019"/>
                  more and more intensely excited, and, at the close, had reached the limit of
                  control. For a moment she was overcome, and leaned against a tree for support; but
                  seeing the stranger make a motion as though to assist her, she rallied again, and,
                  becoming more composed, demanded:</p>
               <p>"How know you these things of which you speak?"</p>
               <p>"It matters but little to thee, to know more than the facts in the case; these I
                  tell thee, but no more."</p>
               <p>"Then you have come as a kind friend to warn me of my danger?"</p>
               <p>"Aye, and more."</p>
               <p>"Thanks! thanks! and pardon me if, at the first, I looked with suspicion on a
                  friend. The circumstances of our meeting is my apology for the ungenerous
                  thought."</p>
               <p>"Thou hadst cause to suspect, if not to fear me, and for thy thought I have no
                  need to pardon thee. But my mission is not yet completed."</p>
               <p>"Then let us go to the house of my father, which is but a short way off, and there
                  hear what further is to be said."</p>
               <p>"No, I have but little time, and this place will answer my purpose quite as well
                  as your father's house, with the situation of which I am well acquainted."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! Then you are not a stranger in these parts?"</p>
               <p>"Not entirely so; but as my business was with you, more particularly, it was
                  natural that I should familiarize myself with your place of abode, that, if need
                  be, I might render myself efficient in a case of emergency, which may arrive but
                  too soon."</p>
               <p>This allusion to danger re-awakened Ellen's apprehensions, which noticing, he
                  continued:</p>
               <p>"I have told you of overhanging peril; yet I have told you but half. You are
                  unable to escape from the net that is woven around you—you have no means in your
                  power to free yourself from the unseen toils that have been secretly laid to
                  ensnare you. Every step you take is one of danger, and every effort you make to
                  flee from that danger, may but drive you nearer to destruction. Such is the nature
                  of your enemy's operations, that, while they are secret, they are sure, and so
                  thoroughly has every preparation been made, and so exact has every minute
                  particular been examined and attended to, there is no possibility of his scheme
                  failing, and equally no possibility for you to escape."</p>
               <p>"Your words are words of doom. How am I to interpret your enigmatical conduct? But
                  now I thought you a friend, come to give me timely warning to guard against
                  threatened danger, when, all at once, you declare my situation a hopeless one! If
                  you are my friend, why not warn me sooner, and in time?"</p>
               <p>This was said in a firm manner, and gave the stranger to understand he had no
                  common, timid nature to deal with. The truth was, the thought had flashed across
                  Ellen's mind that this man was some way connected with Durant, perhaps employed by
                  him, and she began to conclude it might be a trick to frighten her, after all. If
                  so, or if not, she determined to meet boldly what he had to say. The man perceived
                  the change, and replied:</p>
               <p>"My seemingly enigmatical conduct is easily explained. It is true I have a long
                  time been known to the fact that most determined designs of mischief were
                  entertained against you, and that your enemy was ceaselessly at work to perfect
                  his plans; but just as I was preparing to come to inform you of this state of
                  affairs, I was so unfortunate as to be desperately wounded in battle with the
                  Indians. I have but just recovered; the fresh scar you can see on my temple."</p>
               <p>And brushing away the hair, he exposed a hardly healed, terrible gash. This
                  appeared to satisfy his listener.</p>
               <p>"I have, therefore, done the best I could, and you must charge the rest to fate—a
                  fate whose inexorable decree I almost rebeled against bowing to. But I am here, my
                  warning is given, and I can only regret that it comes so late."</p>
               <p>These words and the exhibition of the scar restored Ellen's confidence in the
                  stranger, and, with it, her fears returned. He perceived this, and proceeded:</p>
               <p>"Though your case is a desperate one, there is still some hope; there is a
                     <emph>possibility</emph> of your deliverance from impending peril."</p>
               <p>"Then let me know how I am to act."</p>
               <p>"I fear to do so."</p>
               <pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC5544-00000020"/>
               <p>"Why fear?"</p>
               <p>"It may prove a desperate alternative."</p>
               <p>"Nothing can be so dreadful as falling into the hands of my enemy."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps not; still you may be unable to choose between the evils."</p>
               <p>"Let me know them, and I will try."</p>
               <p>"As I said, it may be a desperate alternative, and I must ask of you beforehand to
                  pardon me for being compelled to give you only the choice between what may prove
                  one of two equally direful evils. Your only hope of relief from present evil
                     <emph>is in me</emph>."</p>
               <p>This was an unexpected announcement; it fairly startled Ellen, and, in the moment
                  of bewilderment, she made no reply. He continued:</p>
               <p>"Do not consider me selfish—at least do not condemn me for my selfishness. If you
                  have ever loved, you know what almost omnipotent power that passion has over the
                  mind and heart. For long years I have loved you in secret, with a burning,
                  consuming intensity of feeling, which defies all efforts to describe. I cannot
                  tell you all the joy or agony love has awakened in my bosom; I can only say, that
                  you have it now in your power to render me supremely happy, or abjectly miserable.
                  If you will cast yourself on my love, I will save you from your plotting foe, and
                  devote my life to your service, and to make you happy. If I had any other means of
                  saving you, I would not propose this one, but I have not. Just now I have not time
                  to explain all that I would like to make clear, and must ask you, for the present,
                  to take my word; for at any moment, even now, your malignant foe may come upon us,
                  and then all is lost. Can you accept the alternative?"</p>
               <p>"I—I thank you, but I cannot."</p>
               <p>"You say, in view of all the facts, this is your, unalterable decision, from which
                  I may not hope to persuade you?"</p>
               <p>"It is. For all or any kind intentions and wishes you may have had or still
                  entertain for me, please accept my sincere thanks; but do not attempt to change my
                  purpose, for it is fixed, and I would save us both the pain of repeating it."</p>
               <p>"Then farewell, and God protect you!"</p>
               <p>"Amen!"</p>
               <p>This one word was said in such a fervent, and, at the same time, confident manner,
                  the stranger paused a moment as he was turning away; for a short time he seemed
                  engaged in deep thought, which had the effect of totally changing his former, and
                  apparently predetermined course of action. Turning again to Ellen, who saw his
                  hesitancy of action, he said:</p>
               <p>"You rely, then, in God?"</p>
               <p>"I do, most assuredly."</p>
               <p>"And you have a hope that He will deliver you from the sad situation in which you
                  are now placed?"</p>
               <p>"I humbly trust He will shield and protect me from harm."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps that confidence induces your present course of action?"</p>
               <p>"Doubtless it does, in part."</p>
               <p>"Well, let me tell you that angels nor devils can save you!"</p>
               <p>"I have no wish to be saved by the devils."</p>
               <p>"I wonder you can be at all merry in your situation."</p>
               <p>"I begin to be less apprehensive than I was."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! and why, pray?</p>
               <p>"To be plain, an explanation will not be very flattering to your vanity, or very
                  creditable to my penetration, and, therefore, I had rather not make it."</p>
               <p>"I see you suspect me, so you may as well know the truth."</p>
               <p>Saying which, he threw off some outward disguises, and stood before the astonished
                  maiden—Louis DURANT himself!</p>
               <p>"You see me, Ellen Walton, and in me your worst enemy, because you will not permit
                  me to be a friend. I have made the present attempt to win you by stratagem, in the
                  not very sanguine hope of success. I have failed—now for my revenge. Know that all
                  I have said concerning my plans, and the net I have woven around you, is true. You
                  are now in my power, and I only forbear taking you captive at this time because I
                  wish you to live for a short period in dread and suspense, as you once made
                  me."</p>
               <p>"Keep to the truth, sir, in making your statements."</p>
               <p>"I intend to; and so bid you beware, and <emph>to escape if you can!</emph>"</p>
               <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC5544-00000021"/>
               <p>"I have a very comfortable expectation for the future, thank you."</p>
               <p>"Well, cherish it, then; hug it close, for it will be short lived, I give you fair
                  warning."</p>
               <p>"The warnings of a man who comes with the tissue of falsehood, are of little
                  worth. Keep them to yourself."</p>
               <p>"Beware how you presume on my forbearance; it may give way."</p>
               <p>"I presume on nothing but your cowardice."</p>
               <p>"Enough! enough! I will bear no more! I go, but you will see me soon again!
                     <emph>Your doom is sealed!</emph> '<emph>Cowardice!</emph>' This from a woman!
                  Gods! but I'll remember this in my revenge!"</p>
               <p>He started, as if to leave the place, but turned again, and said.</p>
               <p>"Girl, I dislike to leave you in this manner. For the love I bear you, I would
                  still see you happy-happy as a wife and not a despised outcast—the scorn of
                  society. You might once have been my honorable bride; yes, you might still be.
                  Passing by all your insults, I would still offer you my hand, and honorable
                  marriage."</p>
               <p>"Infamous villain! how dare you insult my self-respect by even naming such a
                  thing? Never dare again, to couple my name with yours! never, sir! It is the
                  basest sacrilege to humanity!"</p>
               <p>"Very well. Our <emph>names</emph> shall <emph>not</emph> be coupled; our
                     <emph>destinies shall be!</emph> Go, with the consoling thought to cheer you
                  for a few fleeting hours. Here I stand and swear it—witness my oath, ye trees!
                  witness it, earth and sky and, if such beings there are, witness it, angels and
                     devils—<emph>Ellen Walton shall be mine!</emph>"</p>
               <p>He was so deeply absorbed in calling on his witnesses, he noticed nothing about
                  him, and now looking to the spot where she stood, to observe the effect of his
                  words, behold, Ellen was not there. His tragic agony had been wasted on the
                  "desert air." Turning away once more, he left the place in a rage.</p>
               <p>Ellen, though she had left, heard his words in the distance, and notwithstanding
                  she had made a show of boldness, she was really alarmed, and greatly dreaded the
                  future. She knew that an evil-minded man, however contemptible, was capable of
                  doing infinite harm to a fellow-being, when determinedly set thereon. Thus,
                  between hope and fear, her time was passed.</p>

               <head type="sub">PLANS FRUSTRATED—ESPIONAGE.</head>
               <p>DURANT, who considered himself a perfect genius in contriving strategetical
                  measures, now turned all his attention to the execution of the secret plans he had
                  matured, He first accompanied a body of Indians, who were ready to march upon the
                  settlements of Kentucky, with a select few, to whom he had confided his intentions
                  of capturing a white squaw. With these villains he intended to attack the house of
                  the Waltons, while the main body of the savages made their onset upon the bulk of
                  the settlement, including the block-house. This measure failed, for the simple
                  reason that he had mistaken the house, and a family by the name of Scraggs
                  suffered in the stead of his intended victim.<ref rend="super" target="#note_001"
                     xml:id="return_001">*</ref>
                  
               </p>
               <p>He next resolved to go, with a few of his renegade followers, in a secret manner,
                  and steal Ellen at night, or during some of her daily walks, when alone. Soon
                  after crossing the river, he was taken sick, and his followers, mistaking his
                  directions, went another way, and made a worse blunder than on the first occasion;
                  and a party of whites coming into the vicinity of his camp, the villain hastened
                  to recross the river to the Ohio side, not yet knowing the fate of the expedition,
                  that portion of the band who had been commissioned with the execution of the plot
                  not having returned when he was forced to retreat. However, he was not long kept
                  in suspense; one of his men came back, and reported a wonderful adventure with a
                  "big squaw, taller than the greatest warrior," who killed a number of the Indians,
                  he said, and when two of the others undertook to get down the chimney, "big squaw
                  took up mighty great wallet, all full of feathers, more than was on all the eagles
                  of all the hunting grounds of the red men, and tearing it open, easy as we tear a

                  and exaggerations, but founded on truth, nevertheless.<ref rend="super"

               </p>
               <p>Durant saw that some mistake had been made, and that his attempt had signally
                  failed, notwithstanding his confidence and boasting, and the care with which he
                  had laid his "hidden toils." He was greatly exasperated at the failure of his
                  plots, on the success of which he had built such sanguine hopes.</p>
               <p>After much reflection, and the formation and abandonment of many schemes for the
                  accomplishment of his object, he finally hit upon a plan which he felt sure would
                  succeed. This time he called into requisition the services of his old crony in
                  crime, the infamous, but not untalented, Ramsey. With him and a couple of trusty
                  Indians, he set out on his expedition, resolved to succeed at the risk of his
                  life. Ellen he would possess at all hazards.</p>
               <p>The party reached a point which was as near the settlement as prudence allowed
                  them to go, and here, in the deep forest, his three companions hid themselves,
                  while he went forward to make observations, and work out the details of the plot
                  and attack. Stealthily approaching the vicinity of the Waltons, he secreted
                  himself in a hollow tree during the day, from an orifice of which, at some
                  distance from the base, he had quite a commanding view of the adjacent country for
                  a considerable distance either way. Here he placed himself to make
                  observations.</p>
               <p>It was in the early part of autumn; the weather was mild and pleasant; the forest
                  had put on its diadem of rich colors, purple, scarlet and yellow, and was
                  gorgeously beautiful in the ripened glory of its drapery. The season, the scene,
                  the sunny warmth all invited to a participation in the enjoyment which nature held
                  out to those who would accept her bounty, and refresh themselves n her sylvan
                  bowers.</p>

               <p>It was on the second day of his watch, that Durant had the satisfaction of
                  noticing the arrival of a gentleman at the house of Mr. Walton, which was followed
                  on the succeeding day by a circumstance which at once gave him fresh encouragement
                  and sanguine hopes. Ellen made her appearance, leaning on the gentleman's arm;
                  they were out enjoying the pleasure of an excursion into the quiet woods, and, to
                  his infinite gratification, wended their way to his immediate neighborhood.</p>
               <p>Fortune sometimes favors the wicked, and, in this instance, she smiled on the
                  villain; for the lovers, fancying the spot, seated themselves on the trunk of a
                  fallen tree, that lay close to the one in which he had ensconced himself, and by
                  placing his ear near the orifice, he could distinctly hear what passed between
                  them.</p>
               <p>"It is so refreshing to sit in the shade of the 'gray old forest,'" said Ellen. "I
                  have not enjoyed such a treat these many months."</p>
               <p>"Why, with your facilities, I should think you would recreate every day in
                  pleasant weather."</p>
               <p>"That was my habit formerly; but the last time I ventured out alone, I met with an
                  unexpected streak of ill luck, which has deterred me ever since from laying myself
                  liable to a repetition of the same bad fortune."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! You have not informed me of this before."</p>
               <p>"For the simple reason that more agreeable thoughts and memories have occupied my
                  mind; and, after all, it is hardly worth relating, though it made me feel very
                  unpleasant for a time."</p>
               <p>"I must know of this adventure."</p>
               <p>"It was only the unlooked-for appearance of my old and sworn enemy, Durant, who
                  made another attempt to deceive me; but failing in his designs, finally renewed
                  his threats of revenge."</p>
               <p>She then, at her lover's request, narrated the incidents of her interview with
                  Durant, as already known to the reader.</p>
               <p>"Strange that the villain should form such an unaccountable dislike for you, when
                  you never injured him in the least."</p>
               <p>"I think his bad nature was excited, and his ill-will increased, by a few words of
                  merited rebuke I was forced, by his unmanliness,<pb n="48-49"
                     xml:id="VAC5544-00000023"/> to pronounce against him, the last time he was at
                  our house in Virginia."</p>
               <p>"And you have heard nothing from him since the day he obtruded himself upon your
                  notice here in the woods?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing direct or definite, though I think he made an attempt to capture me, with
                  the aid of some Indians, soon afterward, but failed in his object from some cause.
                  But notwithstanding I have heard no direct tidings from him, I feel a constant
                  dread of evil, as though some impending calamity was hanging over me."</p>
               <p>"Such fears had better be banished at once from your mind."</p>
               <p>I know it, and have tried to get rid of them, but they will, despite my efforts to
                  the contrary, come into my mind. I do not and will not yield to them, though I
                  find it impossible at all times to shake them off."</p>
               <p>"Singular, truly; I pray God, they presage no harm."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I so much wish you could always be near me; I dread nothing in your
                  presence."</p>
               <p>"I hope the time is not far distant when this dearest wish of both our hearts will
                  be realized."</p>
               <p>The conversation took a tender cast at this point; and as matters of the heart are
                  secrets between lovers, which they dislike for third parties to look into, we will
                  take ourselves away, and leave them to enjoy their hour of happiness in
                  undisturbed quiet. Several days brought a return of much the same routine of
                  events, the lovers always spending an hour of each afternoon in the woods. Durant
                  kept to his tree, and the others invariably occupied the same seat near his
                  hiding-place. At the end of a week, Durant learned from the conversation of the
                  young couple that the gentleman was to return to Virginia in a day or two, to make
                  preparations for the coming wedding, which was to take place about the holidays,
                  he being now on a visit to arrange the preliminaries, and enjoy for a brief time
                  the society of his betrothed. When they had returned home, Durant muttered to
                  himself:</p>
               <p>"Now is my time! To-morrow is their last day for walking, and, like loving fools
                  as they are, they will be so absorbed in each others' feelings, and the silly
                  sentimentality of love, as to be easily surprised. Yes, to-morrow will be my
                  time!"</p>
               <p>And gloating over the anticipated triumph, he left his burrow, and hastened to his
                  companions, to make known his intentions, and prepare everything for the event of
                  the morrow. He and one Indian were to seize and secure Ellen, while Ramsey and the
                  other should perform the more difficult task of capturing her lover. All the
                  details of their arrangements were discussed and adopted; and Durant, now that he
                  felt certain of his victims—for his hate of Ellen's lover was bitter, though of
                  recent date—was almost beside himself with malignant and hellish joy. He saw
                  before him the speedy accomplishment of his fiendish purpose—the gratification of
                  his inveterate hate and long sought revenge, by the commission of the most
                  damnable act known this side of the "bottomless pit" of darkness; and his
                  sin-polluted heart actually swelled with venomous delight, and demoniac
                  exultation. One of the fairest flowers of earth is to be plucked by his rude hand,
                  and soiled by his touch and embrace! Will he succeed in his satanic designs?</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE LOVERS</head>
               <p>ELLEN WALTON, ere she left the home of her childhood for the scenes of border
                  life, was the affianced bride of Walter Hamilton, a young man of most promising
                  talent, irreproachable character, and fine looking withal; and, in a word, was
                  worthy of the high favor he found in the eyes and the heart of his beloved. As
                  gathered from the narrations of the last chapter, he was now on a visit to the
                  wilderness home of his betrothed, to arrange for the nuptials, which were to be
                  solemnized on Christmas Eve, the winter season being deemed most safe from the
                  predatory excursions of the Indians. All these particulars their bitter adversary
                  was familiar with; and he so exulted over the sad termination of their plans, he
                  could scarcely command his feelings, or act with becoming sanity.</p>
               <p>Without further ado, we will introduce the lovers at their last interview in the
                  forest, previous to Hamilton's return home. The same spot finds them seated again,
                  as though fate led them surely on into the jaws of destruction, and opened the way
                  of triumph for the plotting villain.</p>
               <p>"And this is the last time we shall enjoy together the sweet solitude of this
                  sylvan temple of love?" said Hamilton, after they had been conversing for some
                  time on the hopes before them.</p>
               <p>"Oh, I pray it may not be the <emph>last</emph> time! What fatal words!" replied
                  the fair Ellen, as a momentary pallor overspread her beautiful face.</p>
               <p>"You know, love I only meant for this visit. Of course, I hope to enjoy the same
                  felicity many times when we shall mutually sustain to each other those dearest of
                  all relations; after that our hopes shall have been fully consummated."</p>
               <p>"I know you did not intend to say the last time for life; but the word
                     <emph>last</emph> struck with a chill to my heart, and called up old dreads,
                  which, unbidden, sent a thrill of fear through my spirit. I could not avoid the
                  thought that this <emph>might be</emph>, indeed, our last meeting. Would to heaven
                  the unwelcome thought were banished from my mind, never again to return."</p>
               <p>"Well, love, just banish it. You are certainly in no personal danger; and there is
                  hardly a possibility, let alone a probability, protected as I shall be, of my
                  encountering serious danger on my way home."</p>
               <p>"I know all you say;, I can see no cause of fear; no reason to apprehend danger;
                  yet I <emph>do</emph> feel alarmed; but it is a vague, undefined sensation, which
                  I hope reason will soon banish from my mind. I am not now, and never have been, a
                  believer in presentiments, and I do not intend to become a convert to the notion
                  to-day."</p>
               <p>"I am glad to hear you speak in that manner. There are but few things in the
                  compass of possibility that may not be achieved, if we bring a resolute will to
                  bear upon them. The belief in presentiments, signs of good and bad luck, and the
                  like, is calculated, in no small degree, to 'make slaves of us all,- and to
                  detract very much from the happiness we might otherwise enjoy. I have known
                  persons who were perfect slaves to such things, having their evil omens and good
                  omens, their bad days and good days, their moon signs, their owl signs, their cat
                  and dog signs, and I know not what all other kinds of signs, all of which were
                  regarded with the reverence due only to sacred things. I must confess I have often
                  been disgusted at the tomfoolery of some of these 'signs-people.'"</p>
               <p>"Really, I hope you do not intend to be <emph>personal</emph> in your
                  remarks?"</p>
               <p>"My usual reply to such inquiries is, 'if the shoe fits, wear it;- but you know,
                  love, I had no intention of alluding to you in what I said; at least, if you did
                  not know it, I tell you so now."</p>
               <p>"Very well; your amusing strictures on the 'signs- have had the effect to dispel,
                  in a good degree, my forebodings of evil, whatever may have given rise to them. I
                  presume, if the sign is really reliable, I may now conclude that the danger, if
                  any was near me, has passed away."</p>
               <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC5544-00000025"/>
               <p>"One would naturally suppose that the more imminent the danger, the heavier would
                  be the pressure on the spirits."</p>
               <p>"And who knows but some unseen calamity <emph>was</emph> near us—a serpent, for
                  instance, whose deadly fangs might have proved fatal, or some other unknown or
                  invisible foe, with power to work us evil?"</p>
               <p>"Without entering the field of speculation, we will just suppose your snakeship
                  has departed, and, as your spirits have recovered their wonted elasticity, let us
                  talk of more pleasing and interesting matters."</p>
               <p>"With all my heart."</p>
               <p>And <emph>had</emph> the serpent, Durant, really withdrawn himself? Had some long
                  buried cord of human sympathy at last been touched in his heart, and the
                  slumbering emotions of a better nature awakened? Let us hope so if we can.</p>
               <p>The lovers continued to converse of their hopes for the future, and regrets for
                  the immediate separation; and their attention became so fixed in each other, that
                  it would have required some extraordinary occurrence or sound to arouse them. In
                  reply to a remark of his companion, Hamilton said:</p>
               <p>"Yes, but four months, and our probation will be ended. Would that they would
                  speed away as rapidly as the past week. Four months, and then shall our happiness
                  be——"</p>
               <p>The sentence was never finished. At that precise moment rude hands grasped each
                  lover. A smothered cry arose to Ellen's lips, but was hushed by a covering which
                  was placed and fastened over her mouth. They were both secured with thongs, and
                  led away into captivity. As Ellen was being secured, the miscreant captor hissed
                  in her ear:</p>
               <p>"Be of good cheer, you are in the hands of Durant, the 'DOG!' who distinctly
                  remembers your former kindness and amiability!"</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE CAPTIVES.</head>
               <p>WITH all the speed possible, Durant hurried off toward the Ohio, determined, as
                  soon as it could be done, to place that river between himself and captives and any
                  pursuers that might follow them, when it became known that the lovers were
                  missing.</p>
               <p>It was a matter of wonder with Ellen's family what could keep her and Hamilton out
                  so late in the evening; and when darkness set in, and they were still absent, the
                  wonder changed to alarm. Search was instantly made; they were traced to their
                  resting-place; the evident marks of a scuffle were visible; and the unanimous
                  opinion of all was that they were in the hands of Indians. Preparations for
                  pursuit were immediately instituted, and by daylight next morning, a strong band
                  of armed pioneers, well mounted, were on the trail of the fugitives, determined to
                  retake the captives, if such a feat were in the bounds of possibility.</p>
               <p>Durant had everything so arranged, that his party need not be subjected to a
                  moment's delay. Every member of his band, including the prisoners, expected a
                  vigorous pursuit, and the lovers were not without hope that it would prove
                  successful. In this hope, they, as far as circumstances and ability permitted,
                  endeavored to retard the progress of the captors by slow movements; and Durant was
                  finally constrained to threaten them, if they did not step with greater alacrity;
                  for he feared they might be overtaken.</p>
               <p>At length the hilly banks of the Ohio were reached; the clear waters of that noble
                  stream lay before them; and between the prisoners and despair, and no friends in
                  sight to bid them hope Durant now concluded all was safe; and the malice of his
                  heart, which the pressure of circumstances had kept smothered, began again to,
                  display itself. Pointing to the verdure-clad and tree-crowned hills on the other
                  side of the river, he said:</p>
               <pb n="54-55 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5544-00000026"/>
               <p>"Once there, amid the lovely groves of Ohio, and you are beyond the last hope of
                  recovery from my power, my beautiful girl! Then and there I shall have the
                  exquisite pleasure of informing you more particularly concerning my plans for the
                  future. For the present, receive my assurances, that nothing else could give me
                  such unbounded satisfaction as the felicity unspeakable of having won my old and
                  dear love from all competitors for her hand and person, and the certain assurance,
                  that, for the time to come, she is all my own, without fear of rivalship!"</p>
               <p>The bitter irony attempted in this malignantly polite address went to the heart of
                  the fair girl; but she resolutely set herself against any display of fear, or the
                  least manifestation of alarm, well knowing that the marks of such emotions would
                  but increase the revengeful feeling of delight evinced by her adversary. Just as
                  Durant concluded his speech, the tramp of horses- feet was heard in the distance,
                  and the cry raised by the Indians:</p>
               <p>"White man come! white man come!"</p>
               <p>All hands sprung to unmoor the canoes, which were in readiness, concealed among
                  the drooping branches of some trees which overhung the margin of the stream. While
                  thus engaged, Hamilton, who was watching his opportunity, knocked down the Indian
                  who guarded him, sent Durant whirling round like a top to the distance of ten or
                  twelve feet, seized Ellen in his arms, and with strength almost superhuman, and a
                  speed miraculous under the circumstances, bounded away in the direction of the
                  approaching horsemen, who were how visible through the interstices of the forest,
                  a good way off, but coming rapidly on to the rescue, though, as yet, in ignorance
                  of their near proximity to friends and foes.</p>
               <p>"Seize them! seize them!—shoot the infernal dog!" roared Durant, in a hoarse voice
                  of passion and rage, so soon as he recovered from the astonishment and fright into
                  which the unceremonious assault of Hamilton had thrown him.</p>
               <p>His first command was not obeyed, for Hamilton and Ellen were already beyond reach
                  when the order was given; but the second one led to the discharge of two guns
                  without effect, and the leveling of a third by Ramsey, with a coolness and
                  steadiness of nerve and aim which gave assurance of success. His finger<figure>
                     <p>"Hamilton knocked down the Indian who guarded him, sent Durant whirling
                        round like a top to the distance of ten or twelve feet."—See page 54."</p>
                  </figure>
                  <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC5544-00000027"/> was on the trigger, when Durant himself
                  threw up the muzzle of the rifle, and sent the ball whizzing through the air, some
                  ten feet above the heads of the fugitives.</p>
               <p>"My revenge must be fuller than that, or not at all," he said. "The ball would
                  have killed both, and I would not have had that for the world."</p>
               <p>He had hardly uttered these words, when the sharp crack of the remaining Indian's
                  rifle, who had recovered from the blow given him by Hamilton, and was glad of the
                  opportunity of so speedily avenging it, rung in his ear with piercing shrillness,
                  and looking in the direction of the flying couple, Durant saw Hamilton stagger
                  with his burden, and then both fell to the earth. Instantly the demon was roused
                  within him; every emotion of fear was swallowed up in his usually cowardly heart
                  by the burning thirst for revenge which rankled in his bosom; and crying
                     "<emph>Come!</emph>" he rushed to the spot where the lovers lay, followed by
                  his comrade. Both were wounded, but neither was dead. Lifting the bleeding Ellen
                  in his arms, he bore her back, while Ramsey and an Indian did the same by
                  Hamilton. Springing into their canoes, and bending to the oars with all the
                  strength they could muster, they were soon far out into the stream, and had just
                  reached a point of safety, when the pursuing party of whites came up to the
                  water's brink. Several shots were fired at the canoes without effect, and then the
                  men tried to force their horses into the river; but by yelling and splashing the
                  water with their oars by the enemy, the beasts were effectually frightened, so
                  that no efforts of their riders could induce them to attempt the unwilling task of
                  swimming across.</p>
               <p>Durant could perceive the agony of the father and brother of Ellen, as they wrung
                  their hands in despair, still vainly striving to urge forward their stubborn
                  steeds. Feeling perfectly secure, now that the pursuers were effectually baffled
                  in their designs, he gave orders to cease the frightening demonstrations, and
                  continue their course. In a few minutes the Ohio shore was gained, and they soon
                  buried themselves in the deep woods beyond and were lost to the sight of those on
                  the opposite bank, who reluctantly turned their faces homeward, and, in deep and
                  mournful silence,<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC5544-00000028"/> retraced their steps,
                  revolving in their minds what next could be done.</p>
               <p>Hamilton and Ellen were both severely wounded, the ball having passed through the
                  right side of each, but no vital part seemed to have suffered, and the wounds were
                  not deemed mortal of themselves, but might prove fatal if not properly attended
                  to. Durant's first care was to have them dressed and bound up; and he used every
                  means within his reach to expedite their recovery. He had them taken to a place of
                  safety, a kind of cove, known to himself and Ramsey, which was in an obscure and
                  unfrequented spot, where they were carefully nursed until in a fair way for speedy
                  recovery.</p>
               <p>Until now, Durant had been careful to say and do nothing that might tend to excite
                  the minds of his captives, fearing that <choice>

                  </choice> might ensue, and rob him of his anticipated triumph and revenge. But so
                  soon as their convalescence was distinctly manifest, the crisis and the danger
                  past, he began to torment his victims; the one of his wounded vanity, his
                  disappointed avarice, and his venomous hate; the other of his envy and jealous
                  malice. In consummating his revenge upon Ellen, he would not only gratify his
                  malicious and vengeful nature, but minister, also, to the basest passions of a
                  corrupt human heart. Seating himself in her presence one day, he said:</p>
               <p>"I now understand why it was that I found no more favor in your sight while so
                  foolishly attempting to win your love. Your heart was already occupied, a
                  circumstance you took good care to conceal. Thank my stars, my rival is now in my
                  hands! And do you know, my dear, that he is a doomed man? If not, permit me to
                  inform you of the fact."</p>
               <p>"Sir, what has he ever done to you that you should wish to harm him?"</p>
               <p>"Done! Has he not robbed me of your love, your hand, and made my life a hopeless
                  desert and a weary waste?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir, he has not. My heart was his before I saw you, and <emph>you</emph>,
                  sir, attempted the part of a robber, not Mr. Hamilton. Now judge yourself by your
                  own rule and what fate should be yours?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, very fine logic, truly; but, unfortunately, you have not the power to back it
                  up. I presume you have never beheld the sacrifice of a victim on a funeral pile,
                  nor more than read of prisoners burned at the stake; how would such a spectacle
                  affect you, think?"</p>
               <p>This was said with a peculiar expression, and was evidently intended to make a
                  strong impression; but whatever its real effect upon the mind of his auditor, no
                  visible tokens of dread or pain were manifested, and Ellen replied:</p>
               <p>"I do not know, so much would depend on circumstances; but that I would abhor the
                  actors in the scene of barbarous cruelty, I can well imagine."</p>
               <p>This was not the kind of a reply expected, and Durant changed his discourse from
                  an insinuating tone to a direct manner.</p>
               <p>"I perceive it will be necessary for me to render my meaning more explicit, and I
                  now change the form of my query, and beg to know how you would probably feel, were
                  you compelled to witness the burning of your lover at the stake?"</p>
               <p>A momentary paleness blanched the cheek of the fair girl, as this heartless
                  interrogation was fully comprehended, but recovering herself quickly from the rude
                  shock, she replied:</p>
               <p>"I doubt not the sight would be a harrowing one, but I do not anticipate such an
                  unlikely event."</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, but I may as well tell you at first, that this fate is in store for
                  you."</p>
               <p>"Why do you persist in this attempt at refinement of cruelty? Bad as you are, I
                  give you credit for too much humanity to believe your words are more than an idle
                  threat, which you have no intention of putting into execution."</p>
               <p>"Then you have given me credit for more humanity than is justly my due; for I
                  never was more earnest in my life, and it is my fixed determination to do exactly
                  what I have intimated."</p>
               <p>Ellen, who had all the time been really alarmed, now gave way, in her reduced
                  strength of body, to the feelings which, until now, she had kept in subjection;
                  and, changing her tone, commenced pleading with the miscreant:</p>
               <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC5544-00000029"/>
               <p>"Mr. Hamilton has never harmed you, and can, therefore, only be hated by you
                  through me; do not, then, make him the object of your wrath, but let it fall on
                  me. I will readily burn at the stake to save him."</p>
               <p>This last remark, as it showed the depths and tenderness of her love for his
                  rival, only excited him the more, and he repeated his intention of burning
                  Hamilton at the stake in her presence, with many additions, purposely introduced
                  to make a more horrifying impression. In vain she pleaded for her lover, and
                  offered herself to the sacrifice; the only effect of her prayers was to render him
                  more savage and determined in his intentions and avowals. The excitement of the
                  interview, however, in her case, superinduced a state of fever, which bid fair,
                  for a few days, to render her recovery very doubtful. This result was not expected
                  by Durant, and he in turn became alarmed, lest his dearly bought vengeance should
                  yet slip from him. Every exertion was put forth for her restoration, and finally
                  success crowned the well directed but ill intentioned efforts of the villain.
                  Ellen's fever abated, and she again began to mend. It would be some time, however,
                  ere the monster would dare renew his threats, and in the interim, he set his wits
                  to work with a little different object in view. A new thought had entered his
                  mind, the ultimate end of which he would endeavor to carry out.</p>
               <p>He had never fallen in love with savage life, because it was one of too much peril
                  to suit his natural disposition to cowardice, and he would gladly return to
                  civilized life, if he could do so safely—his Indian home and habits having only
                  been adopted as a means, and the only means, of ministering to his revengeful
                  desires. His idea looked to the accomplishment of this object, and he was fain to
                  believe he saw a way to succeed. As Ellen was to act a part in his newly formed
                  plan, his manner toward her changed. He was polite and respectful in his words and
                  attentions. He was, also, very kind and considerate toward Hamilton. They were
                  both surprised at this unexpected change in the demeanor of their captor, but were
                  unable to account for it. All was explained in time. One day, after Ellen was much
                  restored, he ventured on the following communication:</p>
               <p>"I have," he said to her, "had very serious thoughts of late. A singular dream,
                  which made a powerful impression on my mind, opened up to my mental vision the
                  sinfulness of my past life, and convinced me of the necessity of repentance and
                  reformation. I would gladly amend my ways, and lead a new and better life, but my
                  way is hedged up before me. I am an outcast of society, made so by my own acts,
                  the dark enormity of which I now behold with astonishment, and, unless some great
                  influence is brought to bear in my favor, I dare not return to a Christian
                  community, and if I remain here among the heathens, I may give up all hope at
                  once, as it will be impossible for me, as one of the savages, to become a moral
                  and Christian man. It is in your power, fair lady, to give me the requisite
                  guarantee of safety. May I hope that you will extend to me the hand of
                  salvation?"</p>
               <p>Ellen hardly knew whether to believe in the man's sincerity or not; but hoping for
                  the best, she replied:</p>
               <p>"If in your good intentions I can aid you in any way, I shall be most happy to do
                  so."</p>
               <p>"Thank you; I expected as much from your generous heart, though I have merited
                  nothing but hatred from you by my acts. I will consult Mr. Hamilton on the
                  subject, before pointing out more definitely the mode in which you can serve and
                  save me."</p>
               <p>Leaving her presence, he placed himself before Hamilton, whom he addressed after
                  this manner:</p>
               <p>"I am aware, my good sir, that you are on somewhat intimate terms with Miss
                  Walton, the lady in another apartment of this rather dismal abode, and, I doubt
                  not, have much influence over her. If so, I very much desire the benefit of that
                  influence, to aid me in the best and noblest undertaking of my life."</p>
               <p>He then explained his intentions and desires of reformation, and the impediments
                  in the way, much in the same manner as he had done to Ellen; after which lie
                  continued:</p>
               <p>"Now, to relieve me from my embarrassing situation, I deem it needful to form a
                  connection with some influential person or family, whose recommendation and
                  protection will secure me from harm, and restore me to the bosom of that society
                  from whose enjoyments and privileges I severed myself by a rash act,<pb n="62-63"
                     xml:id="VAC5544-00000030"/> committed in an hour of passion, and followed up by
                  a strange course of infatuation ever since. I know of none upon whose names and,
                  aid I would sooner cast myself than upon you and Miss Walton, as your families are
                  of the first respectability, and could throw an effectual shield around me. I
                  would, therefore, that you let me bear to the young lady the assurances that you
                  approve my plans and purposes, (if you really do so,) and that you are willing t
                  aid me yourself, and hope she will also, in carrying them out."</p>
               <p>Hamilton was still confined by his wound, which had been a much more serious one
                  than that inflicted upon Ellen; and in his then state of prostration, was not as
                  well prepared to scorn the motives of Durant, or penetrate his designs, as he
                  might have been under more favorable auspices; and having no reason to doubt the
                  sincerity of the seemingly repentant man, he entered into his plans at once, with
                  all the warmth of a benevolent and Christian heart. He said:</p>
               <p>"I can hardly believe it necessary that I should say a word to Miss Walton, to
                  induce her to put forth her best endeavors to serve you in so worthy a work; but,
                  if need be, bear to her the assurance of my hearty approval of your designs and
                  wishes, and that I shall do all in my power to aid you in the laudable efforts you
                  are making to return to a Christian country, and a virtuous life."</p>
               <p>"As I have, very unfortunately, laid myself liable to her distrust, will you have
                  the goodness to place your approval on this slip of paper?"</p>
               <p>Saying which, he handed him the paper and a pencil. He wrote as follows:</p>
               <q>
                  <floatingText>
                     <body>
                        <div type="letter">
                           <p>"MISS WALTON:—The bearer, Mr. Durant, has laid before me his
                              intentions and wishes, and the difficulties in the way of his
                              reformation. I most heartily approve his plans, as they seem to be the
                              most judicious that now occur to me, and hope you will assist him to
                              the utmost of your ability in his very worthy object.</p>
                           <closer>
                              <signed>"HAMILTON."</signed>
                           </closer>
                        </div>

                  </floatingText>
               </q>
               <p>As Durant run his eye over the lines, a peculiar expression of satisfaction
                  crossed his features, and with the warmest thanks on his lips, he departed, and
                  lost no time in again presenting himself before Ellen, whom he thus addressed:</p>
               <p>"I have just laid my case before Mr. Hamilton, whose opinion on the subject you
                  will find here expressed in his own handwriting."</p>
               <p>And he gave her the slip. She read the lines traced upon it, when he
                  proceeded:</p>
               <p>"If I only dared to hope you would as readily approve and as heartily enter into
                  my plans, all disquiet in my heart would at once be set at rest."</p>
               <p>"I am quite sure I shall object to nothing Mr. Hamilton approves; and in all good
                  endeavors, I shall be most happy to render you all the assistance I can command or
                  bestow."</p>
               <p>"Then I need entertain no further apprehensions, and will at once make known to
                  you the details which seem to me necessary to be carried out. There are very few
                  persons in the settlements who have any knowledge of my connection with the
                  Indians, and my first request is that you never, under any circumstances, allude
                  to this connection, or let it be known that I have been here. Have I your
                  promise?"</p>
               <p>"Most certainly."</p>
               <p>"I desire, in the second place, that you will say as much good of me as you can,
                  (and that, I am sorry to say, will be but little,) to those who may ask you for
                  information concerning me; but if you have <emph>nothing</emph> good to say, then
                  that you will say no evil, and especially if my Indian life is alluded to. May I
                  hope for your favor in this respect?"</p>
               <p>"I will do my best to exonerate you in all cases where your reputation is at
                  stake, and to aid you in reaching a place of honor in society."</p>
               <p>"Thank you. I have but one additional solicitation to make, and if to this you can
                  give your assent, I shall be truly happy, delighted, and confident."</p>
               <p>All this time he had been driving at one point, which he had now reached, but was
                  slow to present. A momentary pause ensued; Ellen was in doubt as to the nature of
                  the requirement, and he of the propriety of making it. But he had set his all
                     upon<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC5544-00000031"/> the desperate stake for which he
                  was playing, and it would not now do to leave the game. He at length went on:</p>
               <p>"I shall not feel myself safe in society unless I can form an alliance with some
                  family of note and respectability. I am not as extensively acquainted as some
                  others-in a word, I know of no young lady but yourself to whom I can offer my
                  hand, and having loved you so long and ardently, I can do nothing less than make
                  this as my final request, <emph>that you consent to become my wife</emph>. I make
                  this request the only condition of release, and upon your acceptance of my hand
                  depends my present and future hope, my salvation in time and eternity. My fate is
                  in your hands, and you can raise me to heaven, or cast me down to hell. Will you
                  save me?"</p>
               <p>It would be quite impossible to depict the consternation this announcement
                  created, in the mind of Ellen. In spite of her better judgment, and the precedents
                  in the villain's former life, she had suffered herself to be beguiled by his
                  seeming sincerity of manner into the hope that he was really desirous of
                  reforming; and even now she could hardly believe her own ears, so consummate was
                  his hypocrisy; but as the whole truth shone out to her comprehension, she saw
                  through his scheme at once-that all his seeming repentance was a pretense as
                  hollow as his own heart. The hope that had begun to swell in her heart was blotted
                  out in a moment. She replied without hesitation:</p>
               <p>"I cannot accede to your last proposition."</p>
               <p>"Why not?"</p>
               <p>"It is impossible."</p>
               <p>"Then you willingly consign me to wretchedness in this life, and to perdition
                  hereafter."</p>
               <p>"I do no such thing. <emph>You</emph> are not responsible for my acts; and your
                  repentance can be just as sincere without a wife as with one."</p>
               <p>"You are mistaken. If I am doomed to remain among the Indians, I shall never be
                  able to reform, however earnestly I may desire to do so; and if I go to the
                  settlements, I shall be slain as a foe, unless protected by family ties and
                  influence; these I can secure in no other way than by becoming your husband."</p>
               <p>"I am of an entirely different opinion; and I think your whole scheme a very thin
                  and flimsy contrivance, of which you ought to be ashamed."</p>
               <p>"But there are two against you. Mr. Hamilton, as you have already seen, perfectly
                  coincides with me in his views, and—"</p>
               <p>"I beg leave to correct you. Mr. Hamilton never consented to your last
                  proposition, for the very good reason that it was never mentioned to him; in this
                  respect you have tried to deceive me; but to put the matter to rest, at once and
                  forever, let me say, as mistress of my own decisions, that whether <emph>he</emph>
                  should consent to your proposition or not, <emph>I never will!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Then, as you voluntarily cast me off, and consign me to infamy and hopeless
                  wretchedness, be the consequences upon your own head. I came to you and implored
                  assistance in my extremity, but you turned away, and left me in despair. Do not,
                  therefore, accuse me of cruelty if I demand by force that which you have denied as
                  a free gift. You know that I have the power of life and death over yourself and
                  Hamilton, and I now ask you, as a last resort, to choose between assenting to
                  become my wife and seeing your lover at the stake! You may well start and turn
                  pale; for as sure as there is a sky above and the earth beneath us, I swear that
                  one or the other fate shall be yours. Make your own election, and, in doing so,
                  bear in mind that Hamilton's death will be gratuitous, if caused, for you shall
                  then be worse than my wife. As a lawful companion, I will use my best endeavors to
                  make you happy; as a companion in what the world calls <emph>guilt</emph>, I will
                  bind myself by no such promise. Think of all these things, and then decide."</p>
               <p>"Louis Durant, the very proposition you make, accompanied as it is by the
                  alternative, is one of such black enormity, that if nothing else were added to
                  debase you in my estimation, I would spurn your offer as I would the proffered
                  hand of Satan himself or of the vilest imp in the loathsome pit of night where he
                  reigns! You have your answer. As well try to pluck the sun from his place in the
                  heavens or wrench the sparkling stars from the firmament as to alter my
                  resolve."</p>
               <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC5544-00000032"/>
               <p>"Perhaps you will think differently when the trying hour comes, perhaps repent
                  when it is too late."</p>
               <p>"Never, sir villain! Do you suppose I cannot penetrate the thin gauze that is
                  intended to hide your motives? Your highest aspiration is after the
                     <emph>Wealth</emph> you imagine me to possess; if I were poor, you would not
                  even offer me your hand, let alone make such efforts to obtain it. I see through
                  all your devices, base miscreant, including your sham repentance, which deserves
                  the descent of God's just indignation upon your guilty head, and polluted
                  soul!"</p>
               <p>"Your perceptions are exceedingly acute, I must confess; but I leave you for the
                  present, to reflect on the subject, so vital to us all, and hope that reason may
                  yet prevail."</p>
               <p>Much after the same manner he continued to persecute her, day after day, and with
                  no better success. In the meantime Hamilton had so far recovered as to be able to
                  walk about. To him Durant appealed; but his offer of freedom, on condition of
                  using his influence to induce Ellen to consent to become his captor's wife, was
                  rejected with the contempt and scorn it merited, and a brave man could give
                  it.</p>
               <p>This was the last peg upon which the villain hung a hope of working out his
                  purpose, and he now resolved to fall back on his first intention, and execute his
                  long threatened vengeance. The stake was prepared after the most approved Indian
                  model, and the fagots piled high around it. The two victims were then led out to
                  see what awaited them; and this excess of cruelty, this torture in advance, was
                  forced upon the lovers with a view to shake their resolution.</p>
               <p>Again they were separately and jointly appealed to; but with the same result as
                  before; they were pale with hopeless despair, but firm and unwavering in
                  purpose.</p>
               <p>"I would die a thousand deaths of torture, my beloved Ellen, rather than persuade
                  you to sacrifice yourself to save me," was Hamilton's language to his companion in
                  distress. "Life without you would be a burden; and I can now die with a pleasing
                  hope of reunion beyond the grave?</p>
               <p>Durant would not permit a continuation of such interchange of thoughts, and they
                  were separated.</p>
               <p>On the following day Hamilton was fastened to the stake, and an Indian stood ready
                  with a torch to fire the combustibles so soon as the word of command was
                  given.</p>
               <p>"Behold the fate of him you pretend to love!" said Durant to Ellen, whom he had
                  dragged to the spot. "His destiny is yet in the balances; say but the word; and he
                  shall go free!"</p>
               <p>Pale as death itself, and scarcely able to stand, Ellen replied:</p>
               <p>"The will of God be done! I am prepared for the worst!"</p>
               <p>"The worst?" and he hissed in her car some words of infamy.</p>
               <p>"Oh, God! not that! not that!" and she reeled as if struck with a blow.</p>
               <p>"Then, in the name of reason, save yourself, save both! It is easily done."</p>
               <p>The villain's words calmed her in a moment, and she responded:</p>
               <p>"Either fate is more than I can bear; but I will not, perjure my soul to save
                  myself from any fate it pleases God to send upon me."</p>
               <p>"And you will not be an honorable bride, then?"</p>
               <p>"Yours,—<emph>never!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Fire the fagots!" he commanded in a voice of rage, and the order was instantly
                  obeyed by the Indian who stood impatiently awaiting the word.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE BURNING STAKE</head>
               <p>THE material around the stake was the most highly inflammable that could be
                  collected, and a mighty blaze soon spread along the pile, with its fiery spires
                  leaping high in air, and its forked tongues hissing like serpents! Snapping,
                  crackling, roaring! the devouring flames rushed to their work of death!</p>
               <p>The stake was in the center of the heap, the wood being piled around it at a
                  distance of some feet, leaving an open space on all sides, in which the prisoner
                  could walk, being fastened with a cord, some ten feet in length, one end of which
                  was lashed to the stake, a large post, driven firmly into the ground. This vacant
                  space was purposely left, that the sufferings of the doomed might be prolonged, a
                  species of cruelty common in Indian tortures. As it would be some time before the
                  flames would touch Hamilton, though his sufferings from heat would be excruciating
                  in a little while, murdering him by slow inches, Durant hoped that the sufferings
                  and reflections of this interval would bring repentance at the eleventh hour, and
                  cause his victim to plead for mercy on his own terms.</p>
               <p>The fiery circle kept drawing nearer and nearer, narrowing the space between life
                  and death at every moment; yet no groan escaped the lips of Hamilton; and he
                  evinced the steady and unflinching heroism of a martyr. At a sign from Durant, the
                  Indians prepared themselves with long splinters, which were to be fired at one
                  end, and then driven into the flesh of the sufferer; the guns were loaded with
                  powder, to be fired against the naked person of the prisoner when the signal
                  should be given. Hamilton saw all these preparations, but they shook not his firm
                  resolve for a moment. His proud soul rose above all the horrors of the scene, and
                  remained calm in the dignity of its earthly despair and eternal hopes. He knelt
                  down by the stake and engaged in prayer:</p>
               <p>"Oh, Father! give me strength to endure this trial by fire! Forsake me not in this
                  hour of extremity, but send Thy ministering angels to strengthen and sustain my
                  spirit, that it faint not with the consuming flesh! And, oh, God! protect Thy
                  persecuted daughter, and save, oh, save her from the grasp of the destroyer! Let
                  not the wicked triumph! my God, let not the wicked triumph! but shield, oh, shield
                  the innocent! Thou art He who canst do wonders; make known Thy power in the rescue
                  and salvation of the afflicted child of misfortune from the bands of the spoiler!
                  Not for myself, but for her, I implore Thee for deliverance! Oh, hear my prayer in
                  her behalf, and send help in the hour of need!"</p>
               <p>Durant listened to this prayer in spite of himself; there was a something about it
                  which held him spell-bound, fascinated; and he forgot, for the moment, that his
                  followers were awaiting his orders—everything, in fact, but the one scene before
                  him, the man on his knees at the stake. And there was another of those present no
                  less deeply interested, though in a different way—Ellen, who was in agony at the
                  sight before her. A thought entered her mind—a wild thought, which only despair
                  could arouse. She saw the fixed attention of her persecutor, and at the close of
                  Hamilton's fervent prayer, she sprung from the midst of her enemies, and ere they
                  comprehended her design, or had time to lift a hand to stay her progress, rushed
                  through the flames, and fell on her knees by the side of her lover. In a moment
                  they were in each others- arms, shedding tears on each others- bosoms.</p>
               <p>The spectators of this strange exhibition were struck dumb with wonder, as they
                  beheld this act of devoted heroism, and looked on in astonishment, then exchanged
                  glances of bewilderment and consternation. A solemn pause ensued, as though all
                  were paralyzed by such a deed of self-devotion to death.</p>
               <p>"Tear away the fire! scatter the burning embers!" at length fell from the lips of
                  Durant, as he aroused himself from the spell that was on him. "Quick! for your
                  lives! for if they are not rescued, you shall all die!"</p>
               <p>His command was obeyed with alacrity, and every one present worked as though life
                  really depended upon his exertions.</p>
               <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC5544-00000034"/>
               <p>Unobserved by any of the actors in this strange and exciting drama, a dark cloud
                  had gathered, and spread over the face of heaven, black as the heralding banner of
                  an approaching hurricane, from whose bosom the lurid, lightning leaped forth, and
                  the deep-toned thunder resounded. Presently the large drops of rain fell peltering
                  on the leaves; then the first heavy dash of the fitful storm came down, and
                  presently extinguished the fire, which, by this time, was pretty well scattered
                  over the ground. Walter and Ellen, still locked in a close embrace, were rescued
                  from the jaws of the devouring element, and restored to a state of life more
                  painful to contemplate than the prospect of ending existence in each others' arms,
                  even at the stake.</p>
               <p>But He who had interposed to save them, was now speaking through the storm in a
                  voice which made the guilty Durant tremble with conscious-smitten fear. Flash
                  followed flash in quick succession, and the jarring thunder, loud and terrible,
                  broke, peal after peal, on the ear! Then the howling wind, like ten thousand
                  furies, came crashing and roaring through the forest, bearing whole trees on its
                  driving wings, while others bent low before the blasting swoop of its leveling
                  might!</p>
               <p>Cowering like a condemned criminal, the dark-deeded villain crept toward a
                  shelter, dragging with him his captives. Suddenly a dazzling flood of light,
                  blinding and bewildering, enveloped the whole party, and, at the same instant, an
                  earth-shaking, sky-rending burst of sound stunned them all to prostration. It was
                  some seconds before any one recovered. Then Hamilton arose and lifted Ellen also.
                  On looking around, they perceived a large oak had been riven by the descending
                  bolt at a short distance from them. A splinter from the tree had struck Durant on
                  the breast and temple, and he lay bleeding and senseless upon the earth, but
                  whether dead or alive, none could tell, as they had no time to certainly determine
                  the point at such a moment. Hastily gathering him up, Ramsey and two of the
                  Indians carried him to the cave, where they were all glad to congregate themselves
                  during the continuance of the frightful tornado.</p>
               <p>Once sheltered, Walter and Ellen gazed out upon the raging tempest in bewildered
                  amazement, not unmixed with awe. Never had they beheld the elements so fearfully
                  agitated as now! Blacker than midnight were the pall-like clouds that "hung the
                  heavens." Loud as thunder was the roaring of the wind. Incessantly the vivid
                  lightnings blazed forth in blinding flashes; while above all the mingled commotion
                  of the storm, strife, the bursting thunders boomed. Like feathers in the breeze,
                  great limbs of trees were wrenched from their places, and whirled, and twirled and
                  born away. The tough oaks were twisted from their stems, or pulled up by the
                  roots, while the smaller trees, were snapped off like brittle reeds.</p>
               <p>"Terribly grand!" said Hamilton to his companion.</p>
               <p>"A fearful display of God's power!" responded Ellen.</p>
               <p>"A mere breath of his omnipotence—nothing more!"</p>
               <p>For half an hour the tempest raged in violence, then its fury was spent, and soon
                  after the clouds rolled away. During its continuance, the wild passions of the
                  savages were awed into quiet, and their hearts filled with other thoughts and
                  emotions than those of vengeance and cruelty. They were silent as the grave, and
                  harmless as silent.</p>
               <p>The party now found time to look about them. Durant had manifested signs of life,
                  but was evidently badly hurt. Presently he opened his eyes, and stared about, but
                  his glances were those of bewildered delirium. A high fever was burning in his
                  veins; its fires penetrated to the head, and, reveling, amid the brain, unhinged
                  reason, and let loose the fierce passions so long time grown strong and
                  o'ermastering.</p>
               <p>Who shall paint the darkness of a corrupt heart, when for years the basest
                  feelings human nature is capable of experiencing have been nourished until more
                  than mature? It was more dreadful to listen to the ravings of Durant than to
                  witness the fearful war of the elements. The tempest just over, was nothing to the
                  one that was struggling and out-breaking in his bosom. We shall not attempt to
                  record all the dark revelations he made of his own evil thoughts and deeds, as we
                  would spare the reader's feelings from the shock so revolting a record would
                  produce. In his delirium he raved of the past, and unbosomed his intentions<pb
                     n="72-73" xml:id="VAC5544-00000035"/> for the future. First he seemed to be
                  enacting over the tragic scenes of the day.</p>
               <p>"Tear away the fagots!" he cried. "I say, tear them, away! Stupid blockheads! do
                  you not know that I must have my revenge on the girl? Scatter the fagots! Gods! if
                  she dies the heart's blood of every dog of you shall be spilled! I—I must, I
                     <emph>will</emph> have her alive!"</p>
               <p>"During the utterance of those words his voice, gestures, and expression of
                  countenance were in keeping with the language itself, and truly horrible. Suddenly
                  a change came over his countenance; the dark lines of passion retreated, and an
                  expression of timidity or fear came in their place. He muttered incoherently for a
                  time, and then, as if communing with himself, he spoke in a subdued voice of the
                  last scene in his conscious life. A few sentences were audible and connected,
                  showing how his mind was affected by the tempest:</p>
               <p>"How I dread the storm! It tells me there is a God! that the thunder is his voice,
                  and the fierce wind but the motion of his breath! And the lightning! oh, the
                  lightning! how it looks into the heart and exposes all its secrets to the eye of
                  Deity! What a flash was that! Come! to the cave! to the cave!"</p>
               <p>With the concluding words his quiet ceased, and he struggled as if exerting
                  himself to do something very hastily. A moment more and a short, frightened cry,
                  escaped his lips, and he sunk back, as if dead. It was plain that he was re-living
                  and re-enacting the day, and its scenes; and in this condition he remained for
                  some time; then his insanity took a wilder and wider range, calling the past, and
                  exposing the future of his life and designs. He raved and cajoled, commanded and
                  persuaded by times; was now quiet, and, anon, in a fever of excitement, or rage.
                  After one of his quiet moods, he slowly aroused and addressed himself in this
                  manner:</p>
               <p>"That oath! it was a great mistake, the worst blunder I have made. In spite of
                  myself it will haunt me. And the curse! that awful curse! Gods! will it never
                  cease ringing in my ears! night and day, sleeping and waking it never leaves me! I
                  see her now! How weird-like her prophetic looks! How like the sentence of doom are
                  her words, as, with flashing eye and quivering lip, she, says: 'As you have
                  wilfully, voluntarily, and wickedly called it down upon your own head, may the
                  curse of God rest upon you in this world and the world to come.' Gods and demons!
                  if their should be 'a world to come!'—How her words burn into my heart! and, worst
                  of all, they are proving a reality! I am accused! my 'plans of villainy' do fail,
                  and I <emph>am</emph> a 'vagabond upon the face of the earth!' But I'll not endure
                  it longer! I'll shake myself from these haunting fears! aye, and I'll prove them
                  false! I'll do it if all the curses of the universe rise up before me! Avaunt, ye
                  specters! I'll be a man despite your efforts to frighten me by your grim
                  presence!"</p>
               <p>Again, in another strain, he broke forth with this development of his inward
                  thoughts.</p>
               <p>"Heigh, ho! I am on the track now, and nothing can save her! Oh, but I'll be
                  sweetly revenged! I'll teach the proud minx to insult a Durant! Won't she be
                  humbled, though! ha! ha! ha! How she will struggle and beg for mercy! But will I
                  pity her? Yes, 'as the wolf the lamb!' Oh, if I but possessed her now!"</p>
               <p>And again:</p>
               <p>"Proud as ever! Never mind, I'll bring her down! I'll wreathe that lofty brow with
                  shame! I'll strike her through her lover! To save <emph>him</emph> at the stake
                  she'll yield! I'll revel in her charms, and then—then what? Ha! ha! As a reward

               <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC5544-00000036"/>
               <p>Having thus given a few snatches of the revelations made by the villain in his
                  delirium, enough to show what were his intentions toward his prisoners, and the
                  utter blackness of his heart, we will depict another phase of his madness, in
                  which he imagines the swift feet of retribution to be on his track, while the
                  future was uncurtained to his distempered gaze.</p>
               <p>"Coming! coming! coming! and there is no escape! <milestone n="*  *"
                     unit="typography"/> Away! ye grinning devils! out of my sight, ye imps of h—l!
                  Begone! ye ghostly demons, forever pointing with your long fingers! what would you
                  have me see?"</p>
               <p>His eyes were wild with a horrible stare, as if fixed by the magic power of some
                  ghastly sight; while large drops of perspiration oozed from every pore, and stood
                  in cold beads upon his brow! In fixed horror he thus remained for some moments,
                  then fell back and covered his eyes with his hands, as if to shut out the dreadful
                  scene!</p>
               <p>Then rousing again, he exclaimed in another key?</p>
               <p>"No! no! no! not that! I'll not come to that! Alive, and food for crawling worms'!
                  No! no! no! Then birds of prey feasting upon my flesh! Oh, God! the curse! the
                  curse!"</p>
               <p>This last vision seemed to overpower him, and he lay moaning most piteously for a
                  length of time. Then the wilder phases of a distempered mind came on, and he again
                  resumed his frenzied tone, manner, and language.</p>
               <p>"Begone! ye lying fiends, avaunt! I'll not believe your hissing tongues! 'Tis
                  false! all false! Back, or I'll smite you to the earth! Back! back!"</p>
               <p>And he fought the air furiously, for a brief period, then sunk back exhausted on
                  his pallet. A troubled half hour's sleep followed, from which he awoke much
                  debilitated. With his waning strength, the delirium took a milder form. The vail
                  of the future seemed still to be lifted, to give him a glimpse of coming events,
                  but the scene that appeared was not dreadful like the ones which had preceded
                  it.</p>
               <p>"Happy at last, despite my oath, my vengeance unachieved! All my deep-laid schemes
                  of no avail! Oh, Eliza! thou art indeed revenged! Thy worst predictions are
                  realized."</p>
               <p>The fever soon returned in violence, and once more his ravings were dreadful.</p>
               <p>"Ho, Ramsey! keep them safe, on your life, keep them safe ! do you hear? Your
                  life, if they escape! I'll not be thwarted in my wishes; I'll move all h—l but
                  I'll be revenged! ay, I'll walk through fire, flood and storm to gain my ends and
                  work their ruin! They shall not escape my vengeance, I swear it in the face of
                  earth and heaven!"</p>
               <p>But we will not dwell longer on this unpleasant picture of a wretched man exposing
                  his own dark soul to the eyes of others. All the night long he continued to rave
                  in this fever-crazed manner, Hamilton, and much of the time Ellen, too, a witness
                  of his madness. As morning drew near he fell into a more tranquil slumber, and the
                  violence of the fever seemed to have passed. With the early dawn seizing a
                  favorable moment, when all their enemies were asleep, the lovers made their
                  escape. Ramsey and the Indians were so much occupied with Durant, they did not
                  think of the prisoners as they would have done under other circumstances, though
                  they did not feel desirous of seeing the deeds of the past day re-enacted. It was
                  some time before they noticed the escape, and then no pursuit was instituted until
                  after the morning meal was dispatched.</p>
               <p>Hamilton and Ellen made the best of their way down the Ohio, and early in the
                  evening had the good fortune to fall upon the camp of a party of whites, under the
                  direction of Ellen's brother, who had busied himself day and night to raise the
                  force and go in quest of the captives, having resolved never to cease his efforts
                  until his sister was rescued, or her fate learned and her death avenged.</p>
               <p>The meeting was a happy one; and as the object of the expedition was accomplished,
                  the party returned home, when there was a time of general rejoicing.</p>

               <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>WE have little more to say. As the reader will conclude without out reading the
                  fact, Walter and Ellen were married, according to their original arrangements, and
                  afterward lived in the enjoyment of that happiness which love alone can procure,
                  and which can be found only at the domestic fireside where peace reigns; their
                  descendants may still be found in Kentucky and other western states.</p>
               <p>Durant recovered from his hurt, and lived for some years to plot more mischief,
                  and fail in his designs. He at last quarreled with one of his savage followers,
                  and in a fit of anger, struck him a blow with his fist. The indignity was never
                  forgotten or forgiven. The Indian vowed to be revenged, and he kept his oath;
                  dogging the steps of his foe, he found an opportunity to inflict a wound, which
                  felled his adversary to the earth. With proper attention he might have recovered,
                  but his enemy left him disabled and bound, to die by slow inches!</p>
               <p>His wound, at first very painful, soon began to mortify, and he felt the worms in
                  his still living body! Vultures came to feast upon him, ere the vital spark of
                  existence had gone out within him, and he had not the strength left to lift a
                  hand, or speak a word in his own defense, though their long beaks were stretched
                  over him and planted in his flesh and eyes. And when death at last came, and laid
                  his icy fingers upon his heart, for the final stilling of its disquiet and guilty
                  throbbing, his failing senses were suddenly and momentarily aroused, and the
                  curdling blood sent again with quickened impulse through his veins, as his dull
                  ears were saluted with the horrible sound of the howlings of wild beasts in the
                  distance; and the last things that his closing, almost sightless balls beheld were
                  the glaring eyes of the monsters of the forest, as they gloated over their
                  prey!</p>
               <p>The sight was enough to finish the work of dissolution, already advanced near to
                  completion, and the sluggish blood rushed for the last time upon his paralyzed
                  heart with such chilling coldness and mastering power, that it ceased to beat, and
                  the wretch was dead!</p>
               <p>Then a fight took place over his putrefying carcass, and the screech of the
                  vulture, mingled with the angry growl of the wolf, as they contended for the
                  remains of the man of crimes in their wild fury and ferocious hunger!</p>
               <p>A few hours longer, and the flesh was all torn from his frame, and only a ghostly,
                  grinning skeleton was left of the once proud and vicious Louis Durant; and yet
                  fresh beasts arriving upon the scene, disappointed in their anticipated feast,
                  howled a dismal requiem over his bones, which were left, without sepulture, to
                  bleach in the winds and storms of heaven!</p>
               <p>Such was the terrible end of the <emph>villain</emph>, while the
                     <emph>victims</emph> of his hate and malice, against whom he had plotted so
                  often and so fiendishly, were happy in the enjoyment of life's best blessings; and
                  thus the story points its own moral.</p>

               City Publishing House, 116 MAIN STREET, CINCINNATI, OHIO; AND AT Duane Rulison's
               Quaker City Publishing House, 32 SOUTH THIrD STREET, PHILADELPHIA, PA. "SAM:" OR, THE
               HISTORY OF MYSTERY. BY C. W. WEBBER AUTHOR OF THE "HUNTER NATURALIST," ETC.</p>
            <p>THIS great national work which was announced some time since,—and which has for the
               last few months excited so deep an interest in the public mind,—is at last ready,
               having been delayed in order to print an edition sufficiently large to supply the
               very heavy orders which have been already received. This book is destined to exert a
               powerful influence upon the minds of the American people, and to judge from present
               indications, is sure to achieve a greater success than any book ever published in
               America. It is a masterly compendium of the history of the United States, its power
               and progress told in such a vivid and life-like manner, as to fix the incidents
               indelibly upon the memory.</p>
            <p>The author gives us a truthful and extremely interesting sketch of the lives of
               MARTIN LUTHER, the great apostle of religious liberty, and IGNATIUS LOYOLA, the
               scheming and artful founder of the order of Jesuits. He contrasts the spirit of the
               two religions, <emph>Protestantism</emph> and <emph>Catholicism</emph>; shows the
               encroachments which the latter has been continually making upon our free
               institutions, and how these attacks have been frustrated by the spirit of
               independence and the love of religious liberty which form such important elements in
               the American character. In this work will also be found a full description of the
               causes which led to the war of 1812;—debates on the subject, and selections from Mr.
               CLAY'S masterly speeches,—descriptions of naval battles,—privations and hardships of
               early Western settlers,—sketch of the life of BOONE,—glance at the condition of
               Mexico, etc., etc.</p>
            <p>The well known reputation of the author is a sufficient guarantee of the correctness
               of the facts, while all must admit that the style is unsurpassed for clearness and
               elegance.</p>
            <p>The work contains 550 large 12mo., pages, 10 beautiful tint illustrations, and is
               elegantly and substantially bound in embossed leather, gilt, back and marble edge.
               Price, per copy, $2.00. — This book will be sold only by subscription, and on
               restricted territory. A sample copy, including a Prospectus Book, if desired, will be
               mailed to any part of the United States, postage paid, on the receipt of the retail

                  <p>"FEMALE LIBRARY OF HEALTH."</p>
                  <p>There are many reasons why the "Female Library of Health" should be found in
                     the hands of every Married Woman, containing, as it does, so much valuable
                     information upon subjects, which, under a mistaken notion of propriety, is
                     usually withheld from the young, especially from females; by which much misery
                     is entailed; not only upon the mother herself, but lasting evil upon her
                     offspring; all of which may be avoided by perusing the "FEMALE LIBRARY OF
                     HEALTH."</p>
                  <p>There are, also, very many cases in married life, where the prevention of
                     offspring is not only desirable, but absolutely necessary. Such, for example,
                     as poverty, when children cannot be properly taken care of; over-fruitful
                     females, who would otherwise be constantly in a state of pregnancy; hereditary
                     disease on the part of either father or mother, where the having of offspring
                     would be doing rank injustice to the child; where the father is a habitual
                     drunkard. And, again, many females are so formed by nature, as to be totally
                     unfitted to fulfill the functions of maternity except at the imminent risk of
                     life, and, in many cases, the certainty of death.</p>
                  <p>Under all these, and numerous other circumstances that might be named, the
                     "Female Library of Health" is confidently commended to the public as a work of
                     merit, containing the experience of the highest medical talent upon the
                     subjects treated.</p>

                  <p>Danger in the Dark.</p>
                  <p>A Book destined to be read by every American. Do you say light—more light! Then
                     read "Danger in the Dark." Sent forth in the guise of fiction, and clad in the
                     habiliments of romance, this brilliant work exhibits a vivid and striking
                     picture of Anti-republican Romanism in all its grill, repulsive
                     features—hideous forms, and infernal machinations. Like the sudden flash of a
                     policeman's lantern upon a midnight scene of crime, it unveils in a startling
                     aspect, the dark designs, insidious movements, and hidden policy of the Papal
                     hierarchy, and brings to light, the duplicity, infamous plotting, craft and
                     trickery practiced in our midst by the order of the Jesuits—a brotherhood of
                     pious assassins! The vilest and most despicable of our race, who seek to still
                     the breath of Liberty, and subvert the free institutions of our Glorious
                     Republic, while they owe allegiance to a Foreign Despot, and bow to a master in
                     Rome. Upon the guilty heads of these sworn enemies to Civil and Religious
                     Liberty, the author hurls, with giant force, the fearful thunderbolts of a just
                     condemnation, and especially repels, with burning indignation, their audacious
                     assaults upon the Common Schools of our country. To the cultivated mind, this
                     book furnishes a rare intellectual treat; and happily combining, as it does,
                     amusement with instruction, its pages cannot fail to delight every class of
                     readers. Retail price $1.00.</p>

                     most intensely exciting and interesting chapters in history. His escape from
                     Cuba with a small force—landing on the shores of Mexico—burning the vessel, and
                     thus destroying all means of return and forcing on his followers the necessity
                     of conquering or perishing—his march toward the Capital—sanguinary and
                     desperate battles—entrance into the Capital—capture of Montezuma—imprisonment
                     and attempted seduction of Montezuma's two beautiful daughters—their rescue by
                     the mysterious Tollec—Cortez' retreat from Mexico—the fatal and desperate
                     battle of the Bridges, make a story of such thrilling interest, as to surpass
                     the strangest and most incredible fiction of the romancer. The work is by one
                     of the best writers of the day, and the language and style will be found worthy
                     of the subject and the author. Muslin. Retail price, $1.00.</p>

                  <p>Adapted exclusively to her instruction in the Physiology of her System, and all
                     the Diseases of her critical periods. By Edward H. Dixon, M. D., editor of the
                     Scalpel, Consulting and Operating Surgeon, Author of "Diseases of the Sexual
                     Organs," etc., etc.</p>
                  <p>"To the Pure all things are pure."</p>
                  <p>This volume was written for the sole object of affording woman the means of
                     instructing herself, in the knowledge of the laws of life and health, peculiar
                     to her physical structure; an acquaintance with which is, indispensable to her
                     happiness and welfare. This is a truth felt and appreciated by every
                     intelligent mind. It is believed, that to the great proportion of the American
                     women, instruction of the kind imparted by this work, is very imperfectly
                     understood—of the imperative necessity of such knowledge there cannot exist a
                     doubt in the mind of any woman of mature years. This book was not written for
                     the Medical Profession, nor is it designed to make woman her own physician, but
                     simply to inform her of those general laws governing the female system, which
                     every woman ought to be acquainted with. It has already passed through ten
                     editions, has received the highest commendations from the Press and other

                  <p>It would be difficult to find any contribution to Sacred Literature that has
                     attained to a higher rank than the Commentaries of Dr. Adam Clarke. Beside
                     forming a moderate but clear elucidation of the true meaning of the Sacred
                     Word, it abounds with illustrations in Science, the Literature of all ages, and
                     the history of all times and countries. It is difficult to conceive of a
                     complete library without this valuable work, and yet, alone of itself, it
                     affords its possessor no mean variety of entertainment.</p>

                  <p>Perhaps there is no book in our language that has been more generally read, and
                     the teachings of which have been in a greater degree appreciated than the

                     various phases, at the time and anterior to that of writing, it inculcates sage
                     maxims and advice, applicable at all times, and to the improvement of those who

            <p>Persons who are out of employment, and Mechanics of all classes who have become
               enfeebled or debilitated from want of open outdoor exercise, will do well to engage
               in the sale of my Books, as it will give them an excellent opportunity to travel and
               see different parts of the United States, and become conversant with the customs of
               the people in all parts. It will throw open to their view the different kinds of
               business that are being carried on in the various parts of the country; teach them
               the laws of human nature in all of its variations; invigorate their system and afford
               all, who are industrious and economical, a pecuniary reward for their labors far
               greater than could be afforded at mechanical employment or in any clerkship.</p>
            <p>Individuals who wish to engage in the laudable enterprise of selling Books, by
               sending me their address, will have mailed to them a full list of my publications
               with Terms to Agents and instructions how to operate in order to make the business to
               them the most lucrative.</p>
            <p>Those who wish to confine themselves to territory near home, where they can return
               frequently, had better engage in the sale of some subscription book—of which I have
               the best selling in the West—and when I give an Agent territory for the sale of one
               of my subscription Books, I give him an exclusive Agency for the County we may agree
               upon, and furnish no other Agent with said Book for said county while the Agent, who
               holds the county, is doing justice to the business. Those who wish to travel from one
               part of the United States to another, had better carry some of my smaller Books,
               which are not sold by subscription, and make direct sales. There is nothing to hinder
               an active man from traveling from Maine to Missouri, or to any other part of the
               United States he may choose, and at the same time, accumulate money faster than at
               his ordinary local business, and the capital that is necessary for an outfit need not
               exceed from $20 to $50.</p>
            <p>There are men now in the field, who have been selling for the last three years who
               are clearing over $100 per month, over and above all expenses, and yet there is room
               for others to do full as well.</p>
            <p>A sample copy of any book on my list will be mailed to any part of the United States
               on receipt of the retail price, postage paid. $6 worth of my Books, at retail prices
               will be mailed, prepaid, on receipt of $5; or $13 worth of books, at retail prices,
               will be mail prepaid on receipt of $10; for further information or Terms to Agents,
