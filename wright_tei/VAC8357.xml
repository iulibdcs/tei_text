THE warm sun smiled pleasantly upon the little town of Wilton, one summer day. The rain the previous night had been quite industrious, and had washed the dust from the neat white houses, and polished the windows until they glistened, and shone in the bright sun-light, like so many great jewels; and had scrubbed the side-walks, and cleaned up everything --in the most creditable manner. But the kindly rain had done much more than this;-it had freshened the trees, and sprouted the garden plants; opened the buds, and new painted the grass, until Wilton seemed a different place, and looked rather proudly at the sun when that monarch condescended tolift himself over the hills to peep at his subjects. Upon the right hand side of the main street, at the northern end of the town, stood the cabinet-ware shop; and from its open door came the merry sound of a hammer, very early in the morning. There was real life and activity in the strokes of that hammer, and one could easily tell that a strong arm wielded it, and 1  &#xD;<pb n="2-3" xml:id="VAC8357-00000004"/> 2       THE OLD ARM CHAIR. - that a young, stout-will directed the arm in its work. Presently the noise of the hammer ceased, and the young workman made his appearance at the door. His face was fresh and bright, with black sparkling ,eyes and ruddy cheeks. Not a line of care was written on his high forehead. Every expression of his countenance indicated cheerfulness, contentment, and hope. You could see a noble, honest, kindly soul looking out from the depths of those pretty eyes; for they were pretty, and the whole face too. His figure was good-just right for his years, and gave evidence of health and strength. The young man was Martin Preston,- apprentice -to Amos Stores; the only cabinet-maker in Wilton. On the opposite side of the street, a few doors above, was a handsome residence; always kept in excellent repair. There were pretty, green latticed shutters to the upper windows, and when the shutters were open you could see snowy curtains; and when the bold wind lifted the curtains and permitted a view of the interior; there were neatness order and comfort to be. seen. The apprentice looked over at the cottage as soon as he came to the door, and continued to look, although the shutters were all closed, and there was nothing particularly likely to attract his attention. But as he gazed, there was a trembling of the middle shutter, and a click of a bolt, and whilst the youth's .   THE OLD- ARM CHAIR.    '   3 eyes lit up and a warm flush suffused his manly face, the shutter flew wide open, and a sweet little face appeared under the drooped curtain, and a dear little hand threw the apprentice a kiss from the rosiest and richest of lips. The young man returned the salute with interest, and they seemed to talk- with their eyes. She stood there only a few moments, and then threw another kiss and disappeared. The apprentice continued to gaze a moment at the vacant window; then, with a half sigh, went in, and soon the hammer was sounding again. A few months prior to this charming little scene, the apprentice was looking from the door, carelessly, one day, when a crash of pottery and a shriek attracted his attention to the handsome house which he had often regarded before, but with no particular interest. His quick eye caught in the scene at once. A young girl, whom he had never seen before, was leaning from the window, looking down upon a broken flower-pot, and a crushed flower. Martin ran- over the street in the twinkling of an eye, and picked up the plant. The young girl came down and opened the door.  Martin presented the flower, which she received with a blush, and a gentle "thank you," which sounded sweeter to him than any- thing he had ever heard.  &#xD;<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC8357-00000005"/> 4       THE OLD ARM CHAIR. "It is broken," she said, sadly. "I fear it is ruined," answered Martin. "But I hope it will revive, for your sake. You value it!" "Very much; it was a birth-day gift from my father." A few words more, and the maiden went in, and the apprentice returned to his work. All that day he thought about the beautiful girl across the street, and wondered that he had never-noticed her before. When Amos Stores came into the shop the next day-for he had been away on business; Martin asked him about the inmates of that house. "Ah!" said his master, laughing, "Is Jeannette home then'? Look out, Martins my lad; she is very winning. She'll steal your heart." "Let her;" said the apprentice, sturdily. "I see," continued his master, shaking his head. "She has done it already. But have a care, my boy. The golden apple is well guarded,-too well for you ;" and the smile left the old cabinet-maker's face as he said this. "But tell me, sir, if agreeable to you, who lives there?" said Martin. "An old sea captain," answered the old man. "A churlish old man, who is rich and proud and cross." "Indeed!" laughed Martin, as he listened to this not very complimentary strain. L    THE OLD ARM CHAIR.        5 "Yes; and he has been away for three months on his last cruise, and has brought his daughter home from school, for good. A charming girl, and a good girl she is. She comes to see my wife occasion- ally." "What is her--his name?" asked the apprentice, a little confused. "Jeannette Archman," answered the old man, smiling at Martin's blushes. "Thank you ;" said the apprentice, and he resumed his wonted task in silence. Amos Stores walked to one side, and stood regarding his workman with considerable interest. Poor fellow, he thought. "He'll love her next, and perhaps she may love him, for he is a handsome youth, and beauty has its power; and then there'll be trouble, and two hearts broken; for that selfish old curmudgeon will never listen to a love unbacked by gold, if I know myself. If I was only rich," sighed the old cabinet- maker, and -he walked to his bench without saying what he would like to do in that case. The day succeeding the accident at the window, Martin walked over and tapped lightly at the door. Jeannette opened it, and bade him a good-morning, with a very becoming blush. "Pardon the liberty," said Martin; "but I wished to ask how the flower is doing?"  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC8357-00000006"/> 6       THE OLD ARM CHAIR. "It is withered," answered Jeannette. "It will, no doubt, die; the roots were broken so badly." "I am very sorry," said Martin. "(I wish I could have saved it for you." "Thank you," she returned. ",I should have been more careful.- I turned it over with my elbow, in opening the shutter." "I hope it may yet revive," said Martin, turning away with a bow. An evening or two after this chat, when Martin arrived at home, he found Jeannette sitting with Mrs. Stores. The good dame persuaded the maiden to stay to supper. Martin was formally introduced, and en- joyed a pleasant conversation with her. After the meal was cleared away, Jeannette said she must go, and as it was dark, Martin walked home with her. From that time they were friends. Jeannette often visited Mrs. Stores, and Martin always accompanied her in her walk home. Their friendship under such genial skies soon ripened into love. The maiden was at times fearful she was incurring her father's anger; but love laughed at her, and as they were discreet, all went on well. When Martin came into Wilton a few years before, he stopped with his little bundle at the cabinet-maker's shop, and went boldly in and saluted the master re- spectfully, and solicited a chance to work for his daily \\   THE OLD ARM CHAIR.       7 bread.  The old man was pleased with his frank, open face and good manners, and feeling in need of just such help, set him to work, and then watched him  narrowly.  The working of the stranger lad pleased him more,-day by day, and so Amos Stores had him duly indentured to serve him five years, and agreed in that time to make him master of the trade. Thus regularly installed, young Martin went at once to work, and veryl systematically too. Week in and out; each day, from  dawn to sunset, he served his master diligently, and soon won his regard and then his love. Amos Stores was a hale old man of fifty-five years; quiet, genial, kind-hearted, clever, and a christian. He was intelligent, quick to notice true merit, and just as quick to suitably reward and encourage well- . doing. He was a good mechanic, and a thorough master of his business; having learned and practiced the trade in the city of New York, many years before settling down to make a  comfortable living in Wilton: which he had done for twenty years. Martin Preston was an orphan, and had no remem- brance of his parents. His first recollections-dim and confused, were of the sea and a ship. After that, he had lived with a  pleasant man--a quaker, who had found him wandering about the streets of a great city, and had taken him to his home and heart, and cared  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC8357-00000007"/> 8       THE OLD ARM CHAIR.,; for him as his own son. He lived with the quaker a long time; how many years he could- not tell; and then his friend died, and he was sent adrift, and went to sea when only twelve years old. For four years he followed the sea, and- then made an engajgeinent with a farmer to go and live with him near Wilton. After a few months the farmer was obliged to sell his farm, and so Martin was afloat again. He then packed up his few clothes and came to Wilton, and found his present place with the cabinet-maker. He had studied some under the eye of the kind quaker, and had im- proved every opportunity to gain knowledge, so that he was rather intelligent. His voyages had given him a knowledge of the world and its inhabitants and cus- toms, and his sailor's life had made him active, fearless of hardships and dangers, and manly in every respect. Amos Stores and his apprentice got on exceedingly well together. The master was patient and anxious to instruct, and the pupil industrious and anxious to learn. In time, Martin was looked upon and treated more as a son than a stranger, and considered in the light of an equal rather than an inferior. t Often they would sit at the close of day, and talk familiarly together. Sometimes a tear would start in Martin's eye when he thought of his obscure birth, but the old cabinet-maker cheered him up with bright hopes, and promised to be his friend so long as he   THE OLD ARM CHAIR.        9 continued to do right; and he would wipe away the tear and kiss his old friend's hand, and resolve to be something for his master's sake and his own. CHAPTER II. FIVE miles out on the road, northward from Wilton, situated upon a rising ground, was Park Place, the home of the wealthiest man in the country for fifty miles around. There was a splendid mansion, built of a light granite, and finished in the most attractive and orna- mental style of architecture.  All the comforts and luxuries that boundless wealth could procure, were in its spacious rooms and halls. Elegant, rare and curious furniture beautified it. Exquisite sculptuary, paintings and articles of virtu adorned it, and made it a perfect palace. Magnificent lawns, shaded walks, odorous bowers, artificial lakes, and extensive drives, sur- rounded it. There were large gardens, and lovelier ones certainly could no exist anywhere. There was scarcely a fiower known that lacked a representative there. From  nearly every clime and soil they had been gathered and arranged with excellent taste, until the eye fairly wearied contemplating their beautiful forms and gorgeous colors. Before the main entrance to the mansion, a handsome fountain threw aloft its  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC8357-00000008"/> 10      THE OLD ARM CHAIR. cooling waters and lavished liquid jewels upon the surrounding trees. Everything in fact that could add to happiness, was found at Park Place. It seemed a home for refinement and purity-a spot breathing of poetry and music and dreamy ease. But there was a dark spot upon all this fair beauty, a discordant note in the otherwise perfect harmony. Austin Malon, the proprietor, was a cold, distant, proud, selfish man. He did not love or care for any- body. He was a widower an d childless, and had a housekeeper to superintend his servants, as arrogant as himself. George Malon, his deceased brother, the first owner of Park Place, then Lakelet Hall, had been just the opposite in everything. He was always kind, obliging, neighborly and courteous. He lored company, and his home was ever open to the stranger who came to its gates. He had an only-child-a daughter-who had been left motherless at her birth. Her fond father, in the tenderness of his heart, could never thwart her in anything. She was his real treasure, and not his gold and lands. Fanny Malon grew up wayward, self- willed and obstinate-a sorrow to her father and a trouble to the household. An English officer happened that way, and was kindly received and hospitably en- tertained. He won the maiden's love--an easy task then-and the doting father, alive only to his child's      ,                .   THE OLD ARM CHAIR.       " happiness, gave his consent to her marriage. There was a grand wedding and a ball, and then the officer found it necessary to return to England, and his bride went with him, leaving the sorrowing parent to wander through his palace-home, and taste its joys all alone. Nothing more was heard of the bride and groom by the good people of Wilton. A few years afterwards the stricken parent died suddenly in his library-sitting in his favorite arm chair, an old and curious piece of work- manship, which had descended to him from several gene- rations, as an heir-loom in the family. His brother took possession of the estate, and the repulsed neigh- bors gradually left him to his gloom and quiet. CHAPTER III. IN a few months Christmas would return upon its gladdening visit, and the last week of December Martin would be out of his apprenticeship. Amos Stores thought of this fact by day and by night, and he was forming a project in his kindly old heart for the good and advancement of his young protege. Martin had been a good lad. He had been as a son to the old cabinet-maker, and they were mutually attached. "Martin," said Amos Stores, one dull morning in October, "you are m-ostof age."  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC8357-00000009"/> 12      THE OLD ARM CHAIR. "In December, sir, I believe, according to our reckoning." "Yes," said his master, looking kindly and approv- ingly upon his apprentice. "What will you do then?" "Remain here awhile, if you please." "You are not anxious, then, to leave Wilton?" said his master, mischievously. , "I'd rather not go away from you at present," an- swered Martin, adroitly. "'You have been a good boy, Martin; you never displeased me. I will do all I can for you when-" Here a light form tripped into the shop, and laid her hand on Martin's arm, interrupting them. "Jeannette!" he said, startled at her sudden ap- pearance. She seemed in trouble; her eyes were moist, and her bosom heaved tumultously, whilst the color came and went rapidly in her pretty face. "My father," she managed to say. "What of him!" asked Martin, quickly. "Is he ill?" "No," she said. a He wishes to see you." "Me!" exclaimed the astonished apprentice. "What does he want with me, Nette?" "I don't know; he seems cross about something. I was in his room awhile ago, and he kept his eyes upon me wherever I moved. It seemed strange-like. At last he said, very sharply, 'Go, girl, and call the young man over the way. I want tg speak with him.'"   THE OLD' ARM CHAIR.'      13 "Aha!" exclaimed old Amos, pleasantly; I told you as much six months ago. But cheer up; don't be discouraged; you've done nothing wrong. Faint heart never won fair lady." Martin took Jeannette's hand, and together they went to the captain's room. "Leave us, Jeannette," said the captain, gruffly. The anxious girl looked tearfully at her lover, who stood like a brave lad, notwithstanding the ominous appearance of affairs, and went slowly out, leaving the door ajar. "Close the door, will you," said the captain, with- out looking at Martin. Martin obeyed, at the same- time giving Jeannette a reassuring squeeze of the hand. . She was waiting outside the door in great distress. '"Take a seat," commanded the captain. Martin sat down opposite his interrogator. "Your name is Preston, I understand. Are you any relation to old Stores?" asked the captain. "No, sir," answered Martin, feeling somewhat indignant at -hearing his master spoken of so disre- spectfully, but not showing it. "Any relation of ainybody?" grumbled the captain. "I hav'nt a single relative that I know -of, sir," said Martin, with feeling. "'Not one, anywhere." 2        v  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC8357-00000010"/> "      THE OLD ARM CHAIR.' And then he took courage, and told all he knew of his early life, and present condition and prospects. The captain listened patiently, with an occasional nod where he considered some evidence of attention necessary., When Martin spoke of having been a sailor for four years, the captain seemed much, pleased. He was silent a few m6ments after Martin ceased speaking; then he looked at him from under his shaggy eyebrows, and said: "Then you have no friends, no money, no any- thing, eh?" "I've a friend or two," corrected Martin. "Or two," said the captain, eyeing him closely. Martin blushed, for he readily saw his sharp ques- tioner understood who was the second friend. "Well, Martin," said the captain gravely, "I'm a rough, blunt old fellow, a kind of a sea-dog, fond of barking, but I don't bite much for all that. I like you, Martin, and I want to talk with you a little. Do you love my girl?" "I do, sir." "And does she love you?" "I hope so; but I never asked her the direct question." "Why not?" "I was afraid." *    THE OLD ARM CIIAIR.      15 "Afraid! eh! of what?" "Of you." "How of me?"  "That you would be angry at her if she loved, and should own it without your knowledge and consent;  and I feared you would never give the latter to her loving an outcast, and poor at that. I believed you looked more at gold and position than honest, true love. Forgive me where I erred."        l "Indeed," said the captain, scratching his forehead. "That was your opinion of me, eh?" "Yes, sir," said Martin; "it was." The captain looked grave a moment, and then broke out into a hearty laugh, at the end of which he asked: "What made you love my girl, then, if you thought I would be the death of your love?" "I could'nt help loving such a beauty-could I?" said Martin bravely. The captain was pleased; he jumped up and seized Martin's hands.  "Help it; of course you could'nt. You're a true sailor." He  patted Martin on the shoulder. "Jeannette," he cried. She was not far off, and came in at once. "Now, Martin, my   lad, ask he--r that important question-will you?" and  the captain let go his hands, and thrusting his own deep in his great  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC8357-00000011"/> 1 6      THE OLD ARM CIIAIRi. pockets, spread his feet apart, and putting on a comical expression altogether, stood waiting. Martin was by no means alarmed at his demea-- nor, and 'so he advanced, and took the blushing girl's hand. Jeannette placed her other hand upon her lover's shoulder, and bowed her head upon his breast in the prettiest manner imaginable, whilst his other arm stole round her trim waist. Not a word was spoken. "Hey day," exclaimed the captain, opening his eyes very wide, and shrugging his broad shoulders. "That's enough, my dear girl; its very fine--much plainer than words. She's yours, Martin. The prize is yours.' A good girl she'll prove; and I'll portion her well for you." "Oh! father!" cried the joyful girl, and she threw herself sobbing into his arms. "Well, what now?" he said gently. "No harm done; nobody hurt, is there? Come now-kiss me- kiss the old sea-horse," he cried in the highest good humor. Jeannette clung to his neck, weeping and laughing by turns. ( Now kiss that young rascal," he commanded. She needed no second bidding. It was no hardship. The captain went softly out, and closed the door. "What's the meaning of this, dear Nette?" asked the puzzled lover.    THE OLD ARM CIIAIR.      1 "I'm suro I can give you no satisfaction," she replied. i' I alwl:vyt .aought I understood father, but to-day I am i .i'1or." "How very diflferent from what I anticipated," said Martin. I fecared he had summoned me only to tell me that I was a poor rascal, and unfit to love you, or to think about you at all. I expected to be com- manded never to see you again.  Strange, strange. It seems unreal that I am holding you in my, arms in his house, without a fear. He is a kind, good-hearted man, after all. People don't understand -him., How one may be deceived." "Dear, good, kind father," said Jeannete.!"He never denied me anything that contributed to my hap- piness. Perhaps that feeling influenced him in this case, where my more than happiness is concerned. He has watched me hourly for months past, and even before I knew it rightly myself, he doubtless saw how dearly I loved you." Here the little beauty blushed at this her 'first con- - fession, and Martin deemed it proper to acknowledge it with love's token of approval, which he immediately did in a manner which left no room to doubt his appre- ciation of her tempting lips. And thus they plighted their troth.

The old cabinet-maker smiled, and seemed very, very happy as he took their hands, and said: "I'm truly glad, my children; I wish you all the joy earth can give.' He could not have said more. When Martin returned to the shop with his pleased master, he asked him how he happened to come over. And Amos Stores explained that- he had been ap- prised of the captain's intention the previous week. The latter had availed himself of Martin's temporary absence somewhere, and had gone over and had a long talk with him about the apprentice, and was satisfied. to entrust his child to Martin's keeping, after hearing what he (Amos Stores) had said in his favor. "I was mistaken in him," said Amos Stores, quiet- ly. "He has a great heart, and will do all that is right. Be as good a son to him as you have been to me, and fod will bless you." "' How can I thank you?" said Martin, tearfully. "You have again been my more than friend."   THE OLD ARM CHAIR.       19 CHAPTER IV. IT was the beginning of the third week in November, that a man came in a wagon to the cabinet-shop, and said he was sent from Park Place, to request the cabi- net-maker to attend his master, on business connected with his trade. Amos Stores got into the wagon, and went at once to see Austin Malon, whom he met in all his grim dignity. A slight fire had occurred in the library, and some of the valuable furniture was injured. One of the pieces was a quaint old arm chair, the one in which George Malon had been found dead. Austin Malon had heard of the skill of Amos Stores, and as the damage done was not worth sending over a hun- dred miles, to the city to be repaired, he concluded to give the job to the Wilton cabinet-maker. So the me- chanic received his directions, and retired. The furni- ture was sent to him the same day. The next ,morning, the master was examining tho old arm-chair, and admiring the rich velvet covering of the seat and back, when he found a dust-covered, crumpled paper, pushed far down between the back and the seat. In much surprise he took it up, and found it to be a letter, with a foreign post-mark, directed in a female's hand, to "George- Malon, Esq., Lakelet  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC8357-00000013"/> 20      -THE OLD ARM CHAIR. Hall." The seal was broken, and he was tempted to glance at the contents. It was dated back nearly seventeen years, and was from Fanny to her father. Her husband had been killed in a duel, and she was dying of consumption and a broken heart. She wrote of a boy-their child,-- some four years old, whom she intrusted to her father's love and care. She had lived in anticipation of bring- ing him to visit his grandfather, and wishing to sur- prise him, had never written of her child before. She described him, at some length, with all a mother's pride. She wrote that a kind friend was about re- turning to America, and that she would send the boy with her. Then followed a postscript, in a different hand, set- ting forth that Mrs. Bradley was dead, and thrat she (the friend) would take passage in the "Sea Foam" upon a certain day, and stated when the" captain ex- pected to anchor in New York harbor. "Dear me!" murmured Amos Stores, when he had finished the unexpeptedly-disclosed letter. "There was another heir, then. Perhaps is yet-who knows!" and the old man laid the letter away, and sat thinking and worrying about it. "What could have become of him!" -he wondered. "Did Austin Malon know of the letter or anything   THE. OLD ARM CHAIR. -21 about the heir?"Once he thought of going immediately to Park Place, to ask a-dozen questions. Then con- eluded, that would not be well-and so resolved to re- tain the- letter and his secret, until a more. fitting time to learn more about them. A few days passed, when one morning the shop door opened, and a weather-beaten face looked in. "Which is Captain Archman's house?" asked the face. Martin turned to point it out, when the door was opened wider, and a body followed the face into the room. The new comer was evidently a sailpr, a cap- tain himself, perhaps, judging by his neat dress and good manners. He seemed surprised at something about the apprentice, who stood quietly under a keen inspection of his whole figure, Suddenly the stranger seemedto recollect himself, and' said, touching his cap: "Beg pardon, sir; I seem rude, no doubt. Your face is not unfamiliar to me, and yet I am at a loss to say where I've seen it before." He drew his hand * across his brow, as if to clear away some obstruction from his vision, and looked at Martin again. "May I ask your name?" "Certainly," answered Martin.  "My name is Martin Preston." "Yes, I thought so. You don't remember me--do you?"         -  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC8357-00000014"/> 22      THE OLD ARM CHAIR. "No, sir, and yes, sir," returned Martin, laughing. '( There's something about you seems not new to me; but I can't explain it." By this time Amos Stores drew near, and said, with considerable interest: "What is it?" looking at the stranger. "' Well, sir, you see I've found an old acquaintance. I'm certain I'm not mistaken. Just a moment, sir, if you will allow the liberty," and he raised his browned and rough hand, and lifted the black locks from off Martin's brow. "There! look there! it is!" he con- tinued, pointing to a scar, an inch long, across the head, near the roots of the hair. Amos Stores leaned forward and saw it. "What of that?" he asked. "Why, sir,-but 'tis a- story that needs a breath or two. I am a sea captain; Edward Saubrey is' my name. About," he paused, and looked thoughtfully at the floor; ; sixteen years ago, niy vessel, the ' May Bird,' was in port at New York. I was just married, and had my bride on board. We were standing on the deck one evening before dark, when a- nicely- dressed man came alongside with a little boy, about four years old, leading him by the hand. "' Captain?'" he said, inquiringly, looking up at mc. "' Yes, sir,'" said I.   THE .OLD ARM CIIAIR.      23 "'Are you for England?'" "' Yes, sir' " "' How soon?'" "' To-morrow morning, before day-break.' " "With that, he came aboard, and asked to talk with me alone. "We went into the cabin. He brought the child forward, and told me his parents had died in this country, and. that he was left without a friend but him, and that he felt for his sad condition, and had promised his mother to send him with some care- ful, kind-hearted man to his grandfather, who lived in Plymouth, England. He asked me to take the child out with me, and offered to pay me for any trouble. My wife, whom I called in to consult about it, pitied the helpless child, and said we ought to take him. So I agreed. The gentleman gave me a letter to his grandfather, aI hundred dollars in gold, and a bundle of clothing for the boy. Then handed me his card,-and after spending a few minutes more with us, withdrew. "In the morning we sailed. Our voyage was rather a long one.--We became quite attached to the child. He was quick-witted, lively and pretty. Upon arriving at Plymouth, I went ashore, and made every inquiry for the grandfather: but could not hear of any one of the name on the letter. I left parties on the look-out,  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC8357-00000015"/> 24      THE OLD ARM CHAIR. and brought the boy back with us, on the return voyage. It was at this time he received the mark I have shown you. In running across the deck one day, his foot caught in a coil of rope, and he pitched forward against a stanchion, striking his head on a bolt. He received a severe cut, and we never thought he would live; but- God spared him. Upon landing at New York, my wife went ashore and took the boy; then six years old, with her. She stepped into a dry goods store, to make some purchases. She was detained rather long, and the child amused himself wandering about the store, and standing in the doorway, watching the scenes on the street. That was the last she saw of him. When ready to go, she could not find him; inside or out. She was much alarmed; but thinking he could not be far away, she did not mention it to any one, and set out to hunt him. Up and down, she went; from street to street, but he was gone. She returned to the ship, and told me of the loss. We made every effort to discover him, but failed. Every return voyage, we made inquiry of those who had assisted us in the first search, hoping to learn something of him, but in vain until now." a Do you remember anything of this, Martin'?" asked Amos Stores. ' No sir; I can't say that I do."   THE OLD ARM CHAIR.       25 "Weli;" continued Mr. Saubrey, "You were that boy, at any rate. No doubt about that." "Did you keep the letter, sir?" asked Amos Stores. "Yes; it is amongst my papers, aboard the ship. That is to say, the envelope is- for there was nothing inside; not a word. It was a bogus affair." "A cheat upon you, Eh!" "Yes, sir; and the card too, doubtless. He wanted to get rid of the child, and not be known." "Something odd about all this," said the old man, musingly. Martin had listened eagerly to the accountjust given, hoping to hear something of his parents. "Well," said Mr. Saubrey, disturbing his thoughts, "Since you are happy here, you'll not wish to go back to the sea, Eh?" "No, sir ;" answered Martin. "I feel very grateful to you and your wife, for your kindness, and hope some day to be able to repay you otherwise than by words. For the present I shall remain here." Saying he would call again, Mr. Saubrey was about leaving the shop. He had the door open when the carriage from Park Place passed, with Austin Malon in. Mr. Saubrey looked at him a moment, then turned hastily to the cabinet-maker, who was following tq9the door, and asked, hurriedly, "Who was that man?" 3e  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC8357-00000016"/> g26     THE OLD ARM CHAIR' "That was Austin Malon, the owner of Park Place; a fine home, about five miles from here." "Well, sir; that is the man who brought the child aboard the ship. I'm positive he's the man." "You don't say so!" exclaimed the old man, ex- citedly. "Why that--" he paused. A "Well!" "'Nothing.--You're going over to see the captain, are you?" "Yes." "Stop in again when you come out, will you?" "I will." He moved off, and was presently admitted to the house of his friend. Amos Stores went slowly back to the finishing-room, and sat down to think. His thoughts seemed rather perplexing. He sat awhile uneasily, then got up and walked to and fro-then took up his brush as if to resume his varnishing, and finally sat down again, and fell into a reverie, which lasted until a step announced the return of Mr. Saubrey. "I must see that man," the latter said. "He shall tell me something about this business. What do you say?" "Not yet," answered Amos Stores. ".I've some- thing here ;-look at this," and he handed his visiter the letter.   THE OLD ARM CHAIR.    -  27 Mr. Saubrey read it through carefully, and then they drew their chairs closer together, and were con- versing earnestly in a low lone, when another step in the front room interrupted them. It was Captain Archman. He took Amos Store's hand, and shook it cordially. Again they commenced talking; the captain participating. Some important topic was being dis- cussed. The result of the conversation seemed highly pleasing to the trio. The Captain shook his great fist very emphatically at some imaginary object,- and stalked away; then returned and shook hands with his companions, who nodded their heads sagaciously; and, amidst many words, separated. CHAPTER VI. IT was sunset, of the twentieth day of December; the snow had been falling all day, and now it was white, white, white, everywhere. Everything was so pure and light, and without sound, that it seemed, the trans- formation of a fairy's wand. The evening sky was yet leaden, and the air full of the feathery flakes, whirling about in their dizzy dances, with the boisterous winds; or sinking noiseless to join their resting com- panions beneath. "Martin," said Amos Stores, kindly, as the latter o   &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC8357-00000017"/> 28      THE OLD ARM CHAIR. closed the shop-door, "Just step over a moment to Archmah's, and say we will drop in after supper,--you and I." Martin stepped over, but he stayed more than a minute; for Jeannette came to the door. Then he hurried home. "Fix yourself up in the new suit, Martin!" said the old cabinet-maker, with a touch of pride in his tone, twhen their substantial meal had been attended to. So Martin dressed himself as desired, although he could not help wondering why'his master wished it,- especially upon such a rough night. The old cabinet-maker was very uneasy. -He took down his best coat and bat, and brushed the former three times, and smoothed the latter over and over again. He could not be still a moment. He was at the window one minute looking out into the fast darkening street--then woild turn awayv and walk the ioom rapidly-then throw himself into his great chair, and seem to doze before the crackling fire. But he had no thought of sleeping. When Martin was ready, they repaired to Captain Archman's. ,Mr. Saubrey was there, talking with the captain. The latter was attired in his blue uniform-a suit he had used for special occasions ashore. He seemed to   THE OLD ARM- CHAIR.      29 be in excellent humor, and received his visitors gra- ciously, "Draw your chair, closer, neighbor," he said to Amos Stores. "There's quite a gale to-night, but I reckon 'twill clear away before nine o'clock. What think you?" "Indeed, my dear sir, I'm no weather-wise man. I can't say. You have the best eye for such matters." "Well, Imay have, perhaps," said the captain, laughing; "I think the stars will be out before bed- time., I've seen such squalls often clear away in less time." "I dare say," returned Amos Stores. The captain was smoking a long Turkish pipe, and seemed to enjoy it exceedingly, for between each whiff he would smile, and occasionally remove the pipe to indulge in a little laugh. The three worthies were conversing together, when a sleigh stopped before the door, and a rap indicated  another guest. The. captain chuckled, Mr. Saubrey turned his back to the door, and Amos Stores fidgeted about. A stately tread in the entry, a stately tap at the door, and Austin Malon walked in. He stopped short as his eyes rested upon the com- pany. "Come   in, sir," exclaimed the captain, and getting up, he handed the proud man a chair. 3' ' * I r' '  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC8357-00000018"/> 30      THE OLD ARM CHAiR. Excuse me," returned the other, "I was to see you alone, I believe!" "Oh, certainly; gentlemen, if you please, just excuse us a little bit. This is Austin Malon, Esq., of Park Place," said the captain, with a droll twinkle in his eyes. Mr. Saubrey and Amos Stores arose. As the first stood up, and turned around, Austin Malon started considerably, and his face grew pale. "Eh!. what, sick?" cried Captain Archman. "No, -sir," answered the other; "your room is warm--very warm." Mr. Saubrey advanced, and offered his hand. "I've seen you before, sir," he said, with emphasis. "Ah!" and the proprietor of Park Place trembled a little. A keen eye could have seen it. There were keen eyes there. "I've forgotten it, surely; my memory is bad." "I should think so," returned Mr. Saubrey, look- ing him straight in the eyes. ,' What do you mean, sir," exclaimed the rich man, haughtily. "Who are you, sirrah?" "The captain of the ' May Bird.' Just cast your thoughts back, and anchor them in New York harbor about seventeen years ago, will you? You'll remem- ber me, then. H-" "You've mistaken your man, fellow," interrupted   THE OLD ARM CHAIR.       31 the proud man  scornfully. "I don't know you. Captain Archman, shall we proceed to business in private?" "Certainly, sir-to business? Of course, sir, Jeannette!" She came in, leaning upon Martin's arm. "My daughter, sir-Martin Pres-ton, Squire Ma- Ion," said the captain, waving his hand- towards them. Austin Malon bowed stiffly to Jeannette, but changed color when he heard the other name. He looked covertly at Martin, and seemed troubled. "Now, then, to business," continued the captain, sternly. "Don't you recognize an old acquaintance in that young man, squire?" "What do you mean?".he asked with an attempt at dignified anger, which utterly failed. "That your day is done, and that you are a pre- cious rascal!" exclaimed Mr. Saubrey, sharply, moving in front of the door, and regarding Austin Malon with a fixed, searching gaze, before which he shrank and cowered-like a thief caught in the act. "Dare you deny, sir! bad as you are; that here," touching the arm of Martin-who was thunderstruck as he heard it-" is the true heir to Park Place? Dare you, villain!" he cried, raising his voice to a fear- ful pitch, and-poin ting his finger- at the cringing man.  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC8357-00000019"/> 32      THE OL6 ARM CHAIB, ' Yes, I dare." he answered, at length recovering himself. "There was no heir but ime. Your scheme won't work." "Before God, you know there was another," spoke out Amos Stores, solemnly. "You thought yourself well rid of him forever; but a just Providence has: crossed your plan, and will yet bring right out your dark treachery and crime." The old man trembled with excess of earnestness, as he unfolded the time- worn letter, and held it up before him. Austin Malon raised his shaking hand -to his blanched face, and sank into a chair by his side- great drops of perspiration starting out on his fore- head, where -the purple veins were distended. His lips were blue and quivering, and his eyes glassy and fixed upon the floor. "Ah! you own it now. Fanny's letter, full of proof of what we asserts" continued Amos StoreS;^. The stricken man's lips moved, but no sound issued from them. "Go for an officer, John," said Captain Archman to his servant man, who was standing outside the door, obedient to previous directions. "What would you do?" cried the victim of avarice, roused by the order. "Give you into the hands of the law," said Mr. Saubrey.   THE OLD ARM CHAIR.       33 "Never!"he hissed, starting up savagely. "Make way there." He put his hand hastily inside of his coat, and started as if to rush out of the room. They closed about him in an instant, and seized his arms. There was a momentary struggle, a sharp explosion, and Austin Malon gave forth a wild cry, and his head fell forward, as they laid him down on the carpet. Amos Stores threw back his coat, and a little volume of smoke puffed out, and there was a sickening odor of burnt powder and blood. In his right hand, tightly grasped, was" a small hair-trigger pistol, which had evidently caught in his pocket as he sought to draw it. The load had entered his side, and caused an ugly wound. Martin ran" off immediately for a surgeon, and luckily found him at home. They hurried back, but he shook his head as he caught sight of the wounded man's face. He knelt, and made an examination of his condition, and looking up, said: "The wound is mortal; but he may live for several hours." They raised the unconscious form, with life tremb- ling in the balance, tenderly bore it to the next room, and placed it on the bed. For two hours there was no change. A saddened, silent group sat around the fire in the front room, whilst the surgeon kept vigil by the bedside of the unfortunate man.

Amos Stores having sent Martin home to explain his absence, sat with bowed head, looking vacantly upon the hearth. Towards midnight the captain went out, and Mr. Saubrey drew his chair close to the old cabinet-maker. They were about talking, when the door between the rooms was opened, and the surgeon appeared. "He has revived at last," he said, " and wishes to see you all. He has something to say. Where's the young man?" Martin had returned, and was in another part of the house, talking with Jeannette. They called him and the captain, They gathered about the dying man's bed, in-mourn- ful silence. Austin Malon was nearly done with earth and earthly things. The impress of the death-angel's, finger was upon his brow. The surgeon raised his head a little, and administered a stimulant. "Where is he-Martin?'" he asked, feebly, trying to look about him. Martin took his chilling hand, and stood by the bed, scarcely able to restrain his .emotions. The sinking man seemed gratified by this evidence of forgiveness on the part of his injured nephew. "Be attentive," he said. "I can talk but little.   THE OLD ARM CHAIR.        35 I've much to say. When the letter, which you found, was received by my brother, the shock occasioned by hearing of his daughter's untimely death, and her hus- band's murder, nearly killed him. He took it so to heart, that he did nothing but grieve and pine, not- withstanding the, to him, gratifying intelligence of having a grand-son who promised so much. He allowed me to read the letter, and then said he could not travel so far as New York, and requested me to undertake to bring the child to him. I agreed; and leaving him quite poorly, set out on my mission. At New York I met the lady friend and the child, then about four years old, and thanking her for the careful performance of her trust, relieved her of the boy, and bade her adieu. "I then resolved to get rid of him, and go back and say the vessel had been wrecked, and nearly every soul lost, the  boy amongst them.  I found you," looking at Mr. Saubrey, who bowed, " and you can tell better what transpired after that. I gave the boy the name of Martin Preston, instead of Morton Bradley, and returned to Lakelet Hall, as it was called then,-feeling certain I had succeeded admirably, and that I should never again be-troubled by the real heir to the rich estate I coveted. "I   found my brother dead.

"In that I found the letter," said the latter, "He put it there before he died, probably when he found death coming on. He had a kind of fear of me, and would never allo1 the letter out of his hands. I searched all over the house for it, after his funeral, and concluded he had destroyed it. "I then took formal possession of the estate, and changed the name to 'Park Place.' "But I did not enjoy my ill-gotten wealth. For twelve years I have been unhappy, and shunned so- ciety. My crime weighed grievously upon me at times, and made me a lonely man, dreading the presence of an honest neighbor. "When you, Captain Archman, sent word to me to call and see you this evening, and not to fail, I half feared some trouble was in store for me, and put that pistol in my coat packet, thinking it might be of ser- vice. I have thus been the unwilling instrument of my own death. Nobody else is to blame in the least. I am not altogether sorry it has happened so. Had I had another moment, the crime of murder would have been added to my sins. I would-have killed one of you." He had often paused to rest during the recital of his story, and now stopped -again; an expression of great pain coming over his pallid face.   THE OLD ARM CHAIR.       37 "I am going," he said huskily. "Forgive a sinful man for the wrong he has done you," clasping Mar- tin's hand, and looking beseechingly into his tearful face. "I do forgive you," was the young heir's tremulous reply. , Another-a death-pang-and the spirit was gone. Christmas eve-hallowed time--had come.   Park Place, or Lakelet Hall,- again was the scene of a quiet ceremony-a wedding. No wild bursts of music-no flashes of jewelry upon fair forms-no bustle, nor glare, nor pomp, nor show. There had been too much recent gloom for that. Not a week before, the mansion had been draped and closed, and a funeral company in the great hall. And death had not come gently and wel- come, as to an earth-wearied traveler, glad to lie down and rest, but in violence and blood. A  little group of friends-not more than a dozen- was assembled in the library: there for special rea- sons.  The happy cabinet-maker and his happier wife, Mr. Saubrey and Captain Archman, Dr. Green and his lady, and others of the Wilton friends. The bride was very beautiful in her white robe and orange blossoms, and a handsomer,-manlier groom lever was seen. 4 *            * *            !  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC8357-00000022"/> 38      THE OLD ARM CHtAIKR.

JOE YOPER was an unfortunate man,-a very nfortunate man. Nothing went well with him; every- ling turned out wrong. All manner of accidents, vils and misfortunes befell him. Mr. Joe Yoper, in ct, stood very much in the sense of a safety-valve to community in which he lived and moved. A kind lightning-rod, by which flying troubles and erratic amities were attracted and absorbed; making his ghborhood rather a desirable one.

X upon a small salary; but as he was not at all par- ticular about being, at any time, richly dressed; and as he boarded at a cheap house, he managed to live quite well--quite comfortably. Of course, you have   already understood that Mr. Yoper was not married. Not that he was at all averse to the connubial state, X nor did he advocate celibacy as a better and more -rational condition for man; but he had not as yet re- nounced his bachelorhood, simply because he had never  thought anything about it. From his dull temperament  he had ventured very little into the society of ladies; especially of those sweet, amiable, and fascinating, marriageable maidens, whom to see, is to love. He was three and thirty; but three and thirty cannot be considered as very old; therefore, his case was by no means a hopeless one. One pleasant afternoon, Mr. Yoper retired from the counting-room of banker Blobbs, at a much earlier hour than customary. There was a particular reason for such an unusual proceeding, on the part of Mr. Yoper, as he was never away from his desk until the lamps were lighting up the streets,-winter and summer. Banker Blobbs was a severe, strict, particular, exact- ing-to-the-last minute business man, who did not be- lieve in young men being paid to do nothing; and was equally careful not to pay them a farthing too much for 'what they did do.   AN UNFORTUNATE MAN.      41 Mr. Yoper left the counting-room, and walked very Lpidly along the somewhat thronged thoroughfare, ith his eyes on the ground, not ten paces in front of He seemed quite light-hearted, and appeared to be dulging in pleasant thoughts. Presently a noise of touting caused him to turn his head, as he continued s walk. A horse was running away with a lumbering wagon, Id creating much confusion in his progress down the reet.  Everybody stopped, and everybody .looked; it Mr. Yoper had no time to spare; so he walked on, briskly as ever; occasionally glancing around. Aia Lmp,  a crash, and an oath brought his face to the ont, and his hat to the ground. "Now then!" yelled a fierce-looking man, with his at off, and shirt sleeves rolled up, displaying very awny arms, with very hard, large fists attached to- em. "See what you've gone and done!" The fierce man gesticulated violently, and threw his " ms about in a manner which seemed to indicate a, sire to annihilate somebody.  "My dear friend," expostulated Mr. Yoper, rather armed, "I did'nt mean to, I assure you." ' "You did'nt mean to!" mimicked the violent in- vidual.

Just look at them dishes, will you?" Mr. Yoper had looked, and was looking still, at the glassware, or the fragments of what had been several splendid fruit dishes; and his moist eyes grew moister, and his half-opened mouth twitched as he contemplated the wreck he had made. A rabble crowd was gathering, and every new comer looked upon Mr. Yoper as trying to brow-beat the poor vender of glass dishes, after having done himt an injury. "Don't let him off!" -shouted one adviser. "Make him pay well for it!" urged another. "I dare say he done it on purpose, anyhow," re- marked a third party, frowning ominously upon Mr. Yoper." That gentleman thought it an unavoidable acci- dent on his part. He wondered why the man did not look out for such trouble. It was his business, surely, to do so. Thus reasoned Mr. Yoper, and he did not see why he should pay for the damage done. Still, he could not exactly see how he was to avoid it. The fierce man, by the instructions of his friends, claimed immediate and full remuneration, and appeared inclined to have satisfaction out of Mr. Yoper's delicate body, in case he hesitated much longer. c   AN UNFORTUNATE MAN.       43 "Pitch into him!" suggested very pleasantly-a    - -rough bruiser-looking chap, with his pantaloons stuffed into his boots, and his hands in his pockets; "Hit him under the ear," said the bruiser. The fierce man made a motion with his hands, but Mr. Yoper not relishing the aspect of matters, called out,- "Well, my good sir; what is the amount of the damage?"  The violent man counted," four, at ohe-and-a-half; six dollars, sir! Not a single cent less,-cheap at that." Mr. Yoper had been making an estimate from the pieces, and was sure there had only been three dishes; so he said innocently, "Were there four? Are you positive there were four?" "Of course I am! Do you say I lie?" shouted the other. "No, sir; no," answered Mr. Yoper, quickly. "'I did'nt say so." "Oh!" ejaculated the fierce man, shrugging his shoulders. - Mr. Yoper saw it was no use to contend further. Ie paid the money in full, and hurried away. He had lost much valuable time, and was-very sorry for it. Arriving at his boarding-house, Mr. Yoper found all closed up, and nobody came to answer the n                        . * ' O  * ;       .       *:,  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC8357-00000025"/> "     AN UNFORTUNATE MAN. bell. He felt for his key-in the pocket appropriated as a receptacle for it, alone. Not there! In his vest pockets!-No. In his pantaloon's pockets!-No. Then with a groan he remembered he had used it the previous night, as a wedge to prevent the windowgfrom rattling. So he could not get in until some one came home with a key. When that would likely be, he had no idea. The boarders seldom came home at that hour of the afternoon. The landlady, he recollected, had spoken of her intention to take her daughters to visit a relative in the country. The servant had had permission to go anywhere. "My luck," murmured Mr. Yoper, seating himself on the steps, to await the coming of somebody, who could admit him., Suddenly he sprang up, exclaiming: "Ah! Simpson has a key." And off he went to find that gentleman. Simpson was a fellow-boarder- a clerk on the South wharf, only a mile away. Almost breathless, Mr. Yoper arrived at the business- place of his acquaintance. "Mr. Simpson in, sir," touching his hat to the pro- prietor. "No, sir!" fell like a weight upon the ears and heart of the eager inquirer. "Simpson left here- at one o'clock, and will not return to-day."   AN UNFORTUNATE MAN.       45 Mr. Yoper said, "Thank   you, sir," and turned away. When he, again sat upon the steps, more than an hour had gone--been wasted. Another hour slipped by, and then Kitteury came along, and having a key Kitteury let Mr. Yoper in. He ran nimbly up the stairs to his room--fourth floor, back, windows looking North. A very desirable room in the estimation of the landlady, when she had- shown it to Mr. Yoper, upon his application for board. So cool and pleasant in summer, so warm in winter--so airy and healthy-- so quiet and retired-away from the bustle and noise of the street. So he had rented it, and found it to be, in every respect, exactly different from what -Mrs. Snig- gles had represented. In his room, Mr. Yoper took off his coat and vest, and removed his neck-tie and collar, preparatory to blacking and polishing his boots. Then he took from the inside pocket of his coat a dainty document, an envelope--white outside and pink inside-from which he extracted a gilt-edged sheet of perfumed note-paper. He opened the sheet and read the contents three times. It was an invitation to take tea with a select few. friends, at the home of his particular friend, Miss Stout, punctually at eight o'clock that evening. There was an N. B. to it, stating that " the widow" would 'Iq  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC8357-00000026"/> "      AN UNFORTUNATE MAN. undoubtedly be there. Mr. Yoper blushed when he canme to thee N. B. This, then, was the reason Mr. Yoper had dared to request a few hours from Mr. Blobbs, and had been so anxious to get home early.- Miss Stout lived in the suburbs, and he wished to start early, as he generally was always last or too late everywhere. Mr. Yoper had met the person alluded to in the N. B. of the note a few weeks previously, and had been much pleased with her acquaintance. She was the relict of a retired merchant, who, it was currently re- ported and believed, had died wealthy, leaving every- thing to his widow. Mr. Yoper had found her very communicative. Not obtrusively so, but in a quiet, modest, retiring kind of a way, that was so very charming. She had not in the least recovered from the awful shock of her bereavement, in the demise of  her late husband, although that worthy, lamented and never-to-be-forgotten gentleman had teen deceased for more than three months. She described to Mr. Yoper the domestic happiness, the connubial felicity and perfect peace and love that had been theirs from' the hour of their union, until the last moment of Mr. Grumby's life, a period of three years. She had been very unselfish and sacrificing in all her intercourse with Mr. Grumby, during his life; and in his last ,    AN UNFORTUN ATE MAN.      47 hours, she had been a model of patience and goodness-; so that Mr. Yoper thought what an Eden of bliss their home must have been,-and how very unfortunate that one of the happy pair should depart, leaving the other to weep and sorrow and wander henceforth through the unloving'world, all alone and unappreciated. Not that the widow praised herself, nor told of her good deeds in so many plain words; but occasionally, when expa- tiating upon the virtues and greatness of Mr. Grumby, she would forget herself-naturally too-and then Mr. Yoper would discover that another such a wife:.as the widow had been, certainly had never existed; and from his little experience in such matters, he doubted whether another one could exist anywhere.- And - he even allowed himself to think, that could he but find another such a woman, he would be tempted to woo her. Mr. Yoper read the note three times, and then slow- ly refolding it, laid it on the bed, and stretching his} legs over to the wash-stand, put his hands in his pockets, leaned back in his chair, and fixed his eyes on the upper right-hand corner of the looking-glass. But the bell of a neighboring church, striking six, had a magical effect upon him. He jumped briskly about, locked the door, -drew down the curtains, and prepared to make his toilet. He took off his boots, and blacked and polished them, getting his fingers very dirty,-and- rom rubbing his nose, his: face became dirty also. He  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC8357-00000027"/> 48     -AN UNFORTUNATE MAN. turned to the wash-stand, when lo! there was no soap; he had used the last in the morning, and had intended to purchase a new supply that afternoon,-but the af- fair of the glass dishes had driven it from his mind. If there was one thing more than another that Mr. Yoper indulged in, that thing was soap. He was ac- customed to a very free use of it. He never washed not even the tips of his fingers without soap; and could he do it in this case, hurried though he was! By no means. And so he was obliged to replace his clothing, and run out to the nearest grocer's-three squares off. Mr. Spicer, the grocer and dealer in provisions and soaps, was really just' out of the needed article. "Could the gentleman wait juist two seconds?" Mr. Spicer had sent down town for another box, and the boy was now over his tsual time, and would certainly be back before the ge tleman could take three steps towards home. Mr. Yoper waited one second, two seconds-five minutes-and fully fifteen, before the creeping youth came in. When he did come, Mr. Yoper seized the soap, and rushed out, without wait- ing for the two cents change, which astonishing act rather staggered the grocer and his boy. Again in his room, Mr. Yoper hastily completed his preparations for the tea-party, and by dint of strenu- ous exertions, was ready to set out at seven o'clock. The shades of evening were draping his room, and   AN UNFORTUNATE MAN.       49 the hall and stairs were shrouded in' gloom, when he started. Having extinguished his candle, he murmured something about "My luck-late again i" and stepped lightly and carefully across the darkening hall to the stair-way. Now it so happened, that whilst Mr. Yoper was engaged about his toilet, the servant, Margery, re- turned from a visit to the milliner's, and brought home an elegant new bonnet. She had progressed towards her room, as far as the third step from the top of the next to the last flight, when a loud ringing of the door- bell attested the return of her impatient 'mistress. Jingle, jingle wsent the bell again, and Margery set the band-box down on a step, and disappeared, just as Mr. Yoper left his room. The latter had ascended and descended as frequently in the dark as in the light, for the landlady was of an economical turn, and omitted having the gas lighted in the halls, until very late in the evening, and not a few times forgot it altogether. So Mr. Yoper never thought about the darkness, but commenced descending the stairs. Suddenly he put his foot into the band-box, and being taken unawares in this novel way, he lost his upright position, and went down the balance of the eight steps on his back, in a very irregular style, with the band-box around his thigh, and one foot in the crown of the new bonnet; the other jamming his new beaver hat, which had pre- ceded him, against .the wall. 'Fortunately he was not 5 6       .      -  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC8357-00000028"/> 50      AN UNFORTUNATE MAN. injured, and instantly regained his feet. Kicking away the, bonnet, and tearing off the band-box, he seized his unfortunate beaver, and escaped unobserved to his room.  Mr. Yoper gave vent to several expressions not tolerated in polite-and refined society,and proceeded to an investigation of his condition. The investiga- tion by no means conduced to restore his equanimity. His new coat, not home five weeks, and only worn three times, was split across the back, making a rent of three or four inches, and his hat was ruined. His rose-colored kids were all soiled, and bursted where he had caught at the dusty balustrade, and were, therefore, useless for the, occasion. With these very slight exceptions, his toilet was, unimpaired. He therefore concluded not to permit his anticipated even- ing's pleasure to be spoiled by remaining at home,; so repaired damages with his second best hat, coat, and gloves, and made a second and more successful descent of the stairs, and rushed out of the house. The car he hailed was not full, and he had no reason to complain of slowness,'until about half-way, when the rapidity diminished one-half, then a half more, and 'then there -was a dead stop.    Mr. Yoper  looked wonderingly at the other passengers, and the other passengers looked wonderingly at Mr. Yoper; anad then everybody looked wonderingly at the con- , t   AN UNFORTUNATE MAN. 5, ductor, who did not return the gaze, but looked down the street, and then leaned out and looked up the street, and then disappeared just as Mr. Yoper got up to ask him the cause of the stopping. Seeing a com- motion some distance in front, he thought it prudent to get out and endekavor to ascertain the cause. His first step was into a mud-puddle-and a deep one at that. He drew back with an ejaculation, in which an allusion was made to his satanic majesty, and stood irresolute until- the conductor returned, and cheer- fully informed him that they could go no further for awhile. There had been a large fire- in a neighboring block, and the engines and hose had not yet been removed, so that. the track was too much obstructed to move on. Mr. Yoper groaned, and wished the fire had been "in thunder," and stepped out into the mud again, : and walked the balance of his way. He heard a clock striking eight when he was within two squares of Miss Stout's suburban residence. But he was desperate now, and did not care how late he got there. A few minutes more, and he rang the bell, very faintly. The kitchen-boy happening to hear- it first, ran up and opened the door. A piece of silver gained his sympathy, and he took Mr. Yoper quietly into the back-basement, where by dint of much scraping with a chip, and considerable hard rubbing ; n        rbehr'rbi  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC8357-00000029"/> 52      AN UNFORTUNATE MAN. with a brush, he was being put in pretty tolerable good trim for the tea-party, when who should partly open the door, and thrust her head in, but Miss Stout. That young lady seemed rather surprised at the unex- pected sight presented to her view. The cook had very obligingly placed a wooden bucket bottom up for the better accommodation of Mr. Yoper's foot, and the black boy was zealously at work, alternately breathing upon the boot and rubbing, in a vain endeavor to raise a polish upon the damp leather. Mr. Yoper blushed from his chin to his ears, and from his ears to his forehead, and hung his head and simpered, and stammered what he intended for an apology, whilst Miss Stout exclaimed, not very angrily at all-       . : Oh, you naughty man, where have you been, and what have you been doing? We are waiting for you. You are late again, although I gave you ample notice this time' and she shook her fat finger playfully at him.       Whilst Miss Stout thus reproved Mr. Yoper, he took off his hat, and set it down, without observing where, and so put it in a dish of beaten eggs, on the table behind him, before Miss Stout could prevent him. Then he bowed, and said: "My dear madam- hem-Miss Stout, I mean; I was 'detained by a corn-   AN UNFORTUNATE MAN.     - 53 bination of unavoidable circumstances. Oh, dear! I am such an unlucky fellow. Always wrong, always late. Do forgive me," he pleaded earnestly. "I can't do any better; no use in trying." Miss Stout extended her dimpled hand-a very nice hand it was--in token of forgiveness, whereat Mr. Yoper seemed quite overcome by such magna- nimity, and sought for his handkerchief, to hide his eyes. He felt everywhere, but he could not find it. "Dear me, how unfortunate," he exclaimed. "I did'nt take it out of my other coat. Oh, my! what shall I do now?" asked Mr. Yoper of any one who cared to advise him in his delicate and trying predica- ment. His handkerchief, nicely folded, and safely deposited in the left inside pocket of his new, but torn coat, at home, had been selected carefully, and judi- ciously perfumed; and would have given forth such a delicate odor of rose-geranium. It was too bad; too provoking for anybody but Mr. Yoper, to bear sub- missively. But he was not of a mind to cry about it, and so borrowed one of Miss Stout, which quite. answered his purpose. '"There, that will do, Gab," said Miss Stout to the black boy, who was making sundry motions, indi- cating an intention to renew operations upon the dimly shining. boots. "That will answer. Come, Mr. Yoper, the guests will be impatient." 5:g  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC8357-00000030"/> i4     AN UNFORtUNATE MAN.  Mr. Yoper offered his arm, and they proceeded to the drawing-rooms, where 4ome twenty people were assembled. Miss Stout introduced her friend to the company, and the company expressed itself happy to see Mr. Yoper; which was in this case, no doubt, very true and sincere, as there would be no further need of curb- ing the desire to partake of the supper, which was naturally craved, after a tiresome waiting. Word was immediately given to move to the dining- room. A plethoric old, gentleman, in a black satin vest, and brown cloth coat, gave. his arm to Miss Stout, and led off. o Mr. Yoper followed suit with the widow. The rest of the guests paired, and fell into line; and they were soon in the dining-room, where a nicely set table invited inspection. At a word from the hostess they began to be seated. A waiter moved back Mr. Yoper's chair with one hand, and the widow's with the other. But somehow he was not quick enough in replacing the former, and Mr. Yoper seated himself .on the floor in consequence, taking down with him three very fine china plates, two tall glass goblets, and a quaint old dish, together with sundry knives, forks, and spoons-the assortment making quite a lively racket in their hurried descent. It was a pru- dent and masterly effort on the part of Mr. Yoper to catch hold of the table-cloth to save himself. The   AN UNFORTUNATE MAN.       55 waiter, making numerous fearful contortions of his face in his efforts to smother the volcano of laugh- ter ready to break forth, assisted the fallen guest to his seat, and then made a hasty exit from the room. There was considerable coughing and hemming amongst the company, but Miss Stout rattled her plate, and the feast commenced in good earnest. Mr. Yoper felt very much embarrassed, and would have been happy could he have -vanished from' the table, and turned up in his own room. But the guests were well bred, and of course took no further notice of this little accident. They stared at the opposite walls, and refrained from looking towards Mr. Yoper at all. Yet that unfortunate gentleman overheard one remark which a very pleasant individual in a blue coat and brass -buttons made. Said he: "what a very clumsy waiter."  A good idea for Mr. Yoper. Everybody blamed the waiter then, and not him. He at once felt better, brightened up wonderfully, and became quite self-possessed again. By degrees he managed to learn something of his neighbors. Miss Stout sat at the head of the, table. On her right was a stout, round-faced, bald-headed little old gentleman, in a gray -suit, and a white neck-tie. The little old gentleman had a very red nose, and very small, twinkling black eyes, that seemed to be looking at you from all parts of the table. This indi-  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC8357-00000031"/> 56      AN UNFORTUNATE MAN. vidual said little or nothing, but devoted his time and attention to discussing- the merits of al rich, nicely- browned roasted duck, just in front of him, with no visible abatement in zeal at the third filling of his plate by the obliging 'and very pleasant gentleman :opposite him. The pleasant gentleman sat next to Miss Stout, on the left. He was very neatly dressed in black, with a black neck-cloth, the ends of ihich hid his shirt entirely, so that with the little exception of collar sometimes visible beneath his heavy beard, also black, he presented a very sombre appearance, indeed, and looked as if he were especially arranged to be chief mourner at a funeral. But a glance at his face would have speedily dispelled any gloomy thoughts. He had a cheerful, merry, laughing eye and mouth, and a jovial, whole-souled expression of countenance, which added to a lively, pleasing man- ner, told you at once that he was a jolly good fellow to be acquainted with. He talked incessantly-one sentence to the little old gentleman in reference to the duck, and the next to an elderly lady, a trifle hard of -hearing, on his left, concerning the excellent flavor of a fine salmon, the golden, flaky flesh of which appeared to please her palate exceedingly. Several prim, middle-aged ladies, very precise in their table etiquette,-two or three young damsels, not yet out of their teens,-a few staid, sober matrons,   ,AN UNFORTUNATE MAN.      57 half a dozen young gentlemen, and two quite elderly ones, the widow, Mr. Yoper and the other guests al- ready noticed, made up the company. Mr. Yoper's position was third from the head, on the left. He enjoyed hearing the others talk, and avoided using his own tongue. Said the pleasant man to his duck-loving friend: "You enjoy duck, sir!" "Yes; I am fond, of it," answered the little, old gentleman, between his mouthfuls. "No better eat- ing than duck-young and tender duck, done to a turn, like the one before us. In my young and lusty days, I could have enjoyed such a treat, and would have esteemed it more than gold; but now my appetite is feeble-sadly impaired. I don't care for eating. I can't relish even duck, my favorite dish." "Ah! indeed," said .the pleasant man, in a tone which might have been understood, to convey much commisseration and sympathy for the little, old gen- tleman's failing appetite. Then 'he alternated his attentions with the lady a trifle deaf, who had- been partaking freely of salmon. "A nice fish is salmon, ma'am;" he said looking at her empty plate, "You don't eat enough, however, to catch the taste;-allow me," and he cut another respectable slice very gallantly-the fourth slice for the good dame. of  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC8357-00000032"/> '58     AN UNFORTUNATE MAN. She handed her plate, at the same time protest- ing she could not eat, in comfort, any more. The smallest quantity of fresh fish always disagreed with- her, and she loved fresh fish so very much. She was subject to innumerable ills; enough to have made the fortune of any enterprising physician, had they but been more equably distributed. She was next door to -dead, all the time, and scarcely knew what it was to enjoy a well moment. The pleasant and attentive gentleman expressed due surprise and pity for the much afflicted lady; and Mr. Yoper wondered how she managed to retain any hold upon vitality at all, when he was somewhat disconcerted by her asking to be helped to some large, fried oysters, two plates below him. In passing the dish, his ample sleeve caught in the ornamented top of the silver-plated cruet-stand; overturning it, and throwing out several of the cruets; the stoppers of which popped quickly out, as the bottles rolled viciously to and fro, upon the snowy table-cloth. Vinegar, olive oil, pepper, mustard, and catsup; all seemed inclined to make the best of their freedom, and ran here and there, in provokingly curious, and un- accountable little streams, until they soaked through the cloth, and found sundry crevices in the table, whereby they dropped to the floor. At the instant Mr. Yoper performed this dexterous and entertaining feat, several of the company- on both sidesof the table )   *     AN UNFORTUNATE MAN.       59 jumped up hastily, overturning their chairs, and jerking away their dresses, as if the table was on fire; there- by adding very materially to the general confusion. One young lady caught up a full goblet of water in the excitement of the moment, and having no better use for it, very considerately dropped it upon the head of the gentleman next her, who had not risen from the table; thereby nearly cracking his scull with the glass, and making his collar and shirt-bosom very limped with the water. But the gentleman seemed no wise offended at the impromptu shower-bath; probably be- cause the nervous young lady, to whom he was indebted for the cool favor, was his lady-love: before whom he was well guarded in his expressions. Miss Stout felt deeply for Mr. Yoper, as did all the company. Mr. Yoper had hastily desposited the fried oysters upon the table cloth, and sat down in great con- fusion and embarrassment.. He coughed, and turned red and white, by turns: whilst the-tears started in his imploring eyes. An active waiter speedily removed the cruet bottles, and sopped up the mingled- condiments, and spread pi small cloth over the soiled part; so that in a few moments, no trace was left of the mischief, save in the appearance of the guests' faces.' The pleasant man spoke out rather loudly, nudging his little; old neighbor,-said he,       - ,  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC8357-00000033"/> 60      AN UNFORTUNATE MAN. "Our friend, down there, has shown a decided dif- ference in taste,-he has just taken his duck, cold." At thiS sally, everybody laughed outright, or smiled brightly; and everybody was in good humor. But the meal was ended, and so they adjourned to the drawing-rooms. Mr. Yoper felt rather ashamed of his awkwardness at the table, and not caring to mingle with the company, he monopolized the widow, and was more and more charmed with her, as each moment slipped by. She had been solicited to favor the company with a song, and Mr. Yoper, anxious to make what amends he could, for having so little contributed to the pleasure of the company, gallantly offered his arm, and con- ducted her to the piano. "Dear me! I can't sing," simpered the widow; "I don't know anything! What shall I sing?" "Sing something!" wisely suggested Mr. Yop'er. "What shall it be-! Do tell me," murmured the fair enslaver of Mr. Yoper's heart. "-My favorite ballad," hinted Mr. Yoper.-He had no favorite. And, thereupon, the widow touched the chords, and mingled her sweet voice in a gentle melody, that brought tears to Mr. Yoper's eyes. The remainder of the listeners were not listening at all; but were talking and laughing at a rapid rate.   AN UNPORTUNATE MAN.       61 The fair performer was not disturbed, however, by these indications of attention; but sang on-to the end. Eight verses, of twelve lines each, and a chorus of ten lines to each verse; which chorus the widow very properlyv repeated, to add to the effect. Mr. Yoper turned the pages of the music, invariably, whenever the widow was in the middle of each- one; but, as she had long before learned it perfectly by heart, and had sung it fifty times since, she experienced no difficulty whatever from this little evidence of an ignorance of music on his part. Mr. Yoper was charmed with the widow's a(ccom- plishments. She presided at the piano-forte with much dignity and grace, and sang so sweetly. He was suc- ceeding admirably with his suit. She would, one day, very soon, he hoped, be Mrs. Yoper. He was not particularly anxious to be tied to a wife; and, if the truth were told, there were one or two objections to marrying the widow. But Mr. Yoper saw more of the large fortune than anything else, and had made up his mind that he could arrange matters to suit himself any time afterwards. So he determined to woo, and if possible, wed the fortune, and take the widow into the bargain as a necessary evil. He made love to her all the evening, and when the company were thinking of retiring, he offered her his arm for a brief look at the stars from the back porch.  She accepted, and 6  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC8357-00000034"/> 62  .   AN UNFORTUNATE MAN. Mr. Yoper considering it a suitable opportunity, de- clared his love in the most impassioned language. He appealed to the bright orbs of night to witness .his sincerity, hand asserted that his future would be blacker than the night around them if she refused to make him a favorable answer. ': It is so very unexpected," the widow said; "So sudden and unthought of." Although she had been anxiously waiting for more than two weeks to hear Mr. Yoper declare himself. "I will require a few days to think upon it," simpered the widow. "Dear, dear! so sudden." "Let it not be longer than a day;--say to-morrow," urged Mr. Yoper. "Do, dear, divine creature; coveted being, say you will tell me to-morrow, and make me miserable or happy." They were on the porch., Mr. Yoper had assumed a very persuasive attitude;-in fact, as was whispered to us, in/confidence, the enamored gentleman was down on both knees before the blushing widow. No doubt she was blushing, although it was too dark to discern that interesting fact. He was kneeling within a foot of the steps--six steps leading to a gravel walk, in the garden below them. They had left the window of the darkened room behind them wide open, and it chanced that Bowser, the great watch-dog, was per- ambulating through the house, when his august atten-   AN UNFORTUNATE MAN.       63 tion was attracted by the sound of hushed voices outside. Like a faithful, zealous guardian, Bowser listened, and deeming the matter before him a case for immediate investigation, he sprang through the window, right on to Mr. Yoper, as that gentleman was kissing the fair widow's clasped hands. Of course, Mr. Yoper was frightened half out of his senses; but that was not the worst of this unlooked- for interruption at that blissful moment. -He was tumbled over and down the six steps in an exceed- ingly promiscuous and wretched manner-thus sum- marily ending his courtship for that night. The widow uttered some strange sound. Mr. Yoper never could rightly determine in his mind whether it was a laugh or a scream. But as Miss Stout, who is excel- lent authority in such matters, and who was close at hand, avers that she discovered the widow in a corner of the back-room, when she went in with a light, making very funny faces, and stuffing three handker- chiefs in her mouth, whilst her eyes ran, over with tears-we conclude for ourselves that the lady-had not been frightened enough to scream. Indeed, Miss Stout furthermore was known  to say that the widow nearly died from laughter at seeing her lover disap- pear in company with Bowser, at such a   critical moment.  Mr. Yoper soon found his upright position, not cer-  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC8357-00000035"/> d64     - AN UNFORTUNATE MAN. tain that any of his bones where left whole. He slunk away to the kitchen, where an inspection dis- closed the very gratifying facts that both knees of his inimitable doeskins were split into very ragged rents, and one sleeve of his coat torn from the elbow to the shoulder. Likewise, his fine gold watch, which had. flown out of its little pocket, and rolled about in the gravel, was much rubbed, and had stopped, so that he could not start it again. His arms and back were bruised, his face scratched, and his nose quite skinned. A pitiable object was Mr. Yoper when he entered the kitchen after his fall. The cook dropped her hot iron upon the black boy's toes, and raised her hands in mute astonishment. \The black boy grasped his- mutilated toes, and rocking violently to Wand fro, yelled very freely, until the coachman boxed his ears, and threatened to "rub him down with a cord-stick," unless he instantly ceased his clatter. The -widow soon came to Mr. Yoper's assistance, and helped him to repair damages; so that in a little time he was ready to start for home, which he did forthwith. He found upon arriving at the station that the last car down that night had gone-just gone-not above two minutes. Two men jostled against him as he stood looking down the dark street. They were quite rude, and he felt afraid of themn They went into the office, and he turned away. He was obliged   AN UNFORTUNATE MAN.       65 to walk three miles to his boarding-house, at midnight. This was a performance Mr. Yoper would willingly have given ten dollars to have avoided. He was rather cowardly, and scarcely able to defend himself. A pistol, or other weapon, he would not have carried ,for any amount of -money. He disliked the very sight -of them, and turned pale whenever he heard them spoken of. The heavens were clouded over, and a mist began to fall, giving premonition of a coming rain. He but- toned his coat, settled"his hat, and stalked as rapidly as he could through the gloomy, almost deserted streets. Here a watchman, closely muffled, stepping hastily from an alley-way, set him to shivering. There a cat, rushing across his -path, filled him with horror. A stray traveller, coming up behind, or abruptly confronting him from round a dark corner, gave him immense uneasiness until well out of sight. The winds were rising, too, and talking mournfully together in weird tones. The sleepy lights blinked through the dull, hazy atmosphere, and seemed to be winking slyly at Mr. Yoper, as he trudged fearfully along. The streets were silent and lone, and the tall houses dark, save an occasional glimmer from the window of a sick-room, or a stray ray from the stained-glass door of some late publican's bar. The sharp sound of his heavy-heeled boots was terribly 6*  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC8357-00000036"/> "     AN UNFORTUNATE MAN. distinct to his ears, and a hundred times he tried to walk more quietly, and felt sure somebody would hear him who would do him no good. Hie was half-way home, plodding along a dreary square, when a sound' of coming feet behind him sent a chill through his system. He glanced hurriedly around as he turned a corner, and observed a rough-looking customer, mak- ing the distance between them rapidly less. Mr. Yoper was positive he could distinctly discern a large cudgel under the man's arm. He walked faster, apparently unconcerned, attempting to whistle a cheerful air from a new opera; but he did not suc- ceed very well. His lips were too dry, and his heart too faint. He started out briskly-so did the man with the cudgel. Then he stopped, and looked at a number over a door, near a lamp-post. The man seemed to stop also. HoI resumed his rapid walk. He crossed the street-so did the man. He turned into a :by-street; his shadow followed. He grew nervous and alarmed, and started to run. His friend followed suit. Away they went; faster, faster-Mr. Yoper unning very lively. His hat-always too large for him-blew off. No stopping for that--on, on, until the ground seemed scarcely touched. Breath- less, Mr. Yoper reached his boarding-house, -and rushed up the steps. His heart throbbed tumultu- ously, and his head ached very badly. He fumbled   AN UNFORTUNATE MAN.      67 for his key-found it, and inserted it hastily; but it would not turn. Just then his pursuer came up. In sheer despair Mr. Yoper turned about, when who should his bugaboo be but Kitteury. Said the latter individual- "Why, Yoper, man! what the dickens ails you? What made you run in that style? Gad, but you're a racer." "Here's your hat." / Mr. Yoper gave a tremendous sigh of relief, and even attempted a faint laugh; a very skeleton of a laugh, however. "I knew you, Kitteury, at sight, and thought I would give you a run.  Cold night; exercise at all times healthy. Could'nt catch me, Eh! Kitteury?" "Catch you? gad, no. You seemed to fly. Splen- did time, sir. But really, Yoper, I thought you was frightened at my coming on behind you." "Frightened!" echoed Mr. Yoper, with- a show of indignation; "Come now, old fellow, you know a deal better than that." Kitteury was all wrapped warmly about the head, and would have been hard to recognize at half a square's distance. Mr. Yoper observed that what he had thought a club-was nothing more deadly than a blue, cotton umbrella. They were in the house by this time, and  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC8357-00000037"/> 68      AN UNFORTUNATE MAN. proceeding to their respective rooms, when Kitteury said, "Sleepy, Yoper?" "Not very." "Well, come into my room a bit; I've something to tell you." He opened his door, and Mr. Yoper went in.' Kit- teury struck a light, and then fixed a comfortable chair for his friend, and handed him a mild Havana, and took one for himself. Then he brought out a dingy, mysterious-looking bottle-labeled in large, odd letters, "Bay Rum." He placed a glass for Mr. Yoper, and a white mug for-himself, and then looking into the little stove, saw there was not a spark of fire; and so threw his cloak over his shoulders, and sat down to the enjoyment of the good things he had pro- vided. Mr. Yoper was not fond of a cigar. In fact, smoking rather disagreed with him,-made him very sick at the stomach, and gave him a headache. But Kitteury had always joked and "teased him so unmercifully about his want of manliness in this im- portant respect; and puffed away so beautifully and seemed to realize so much intense enjoyment from his cigar, that Mr. Yoper concluded that practice was everything. lIe thought in time, by careful perseve- rance, he could be an adept in the art, and thus place himself above his jovial friend's assaults. With this   AN UNFORTUNATE MAN.      69 praise-worthy object in view, Mr. Yoper never declined a cigar offered him by Kitteury. So he smoked away, looking feebly at his companion in smoke. Kitteury took up the dark bottle, and begged to fill Mr. Yoper's glass-not a small one by the way. Mr. Yoper nodded acquiescence, for,notwithstanding a lack of prepossessing appearance in the bottle, he knew it had long, long ago, ceased to do duty as a receptacle for "Bay Rum." "A little water, if you please, Kitteury," said Mr. Yoper, tasting the brandy. "Oh, yes!" answered that worthy, rising, and bring- ing his wash-pitcher, with a broken mouth and no handle. Then he dived dexterously into the depths of a great closet, and rummaged considerably amongst a heterogeneous collection of clothing and boxes, and presently came out with a little brown paper bag, which contained sugar. "Mix to your taste, Yoper,-help yourself," said Kitteury, hospitably. Kitteury had his compound prepared in a twinkling, and taking a sip, said, 'U Poor Margery!" and took two or three sips, whilst Mr. Yoper coughed, and emitted light volumes of smoke. 4"Margery brought a new bonnet home last evening, but she'll never wear it," and he chuckled grimly. "Why not?" queried Mr. Yoper.  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC8357-00000038"/> 70      AN UNFORTUNATE MAN. ," Let me tell you. I was in my room before supper, when she came tripping up the stairs, humming a lively tune. Just at a. particularly high note, she went off into a scream, and then I heard something fall, like a candlestick, and so I looked out, but all was dark. Margery was making a tremendous hullabaloo; crying and groaning, and talking-all together. I took up my candle, and went out to the head of the stairs, anid what a sight was there! Margery upon her knees; white as a sheet, before a promiscuous heap of ribbons, flowers, braid, and other fixings of a like nature, which rather puzzled me a bit, to believe had once been a handsome bonnet. Blame me, if I could have arrived at that conclusion even then, but for a smashed bandbox-top and bottom out,-kicked into a corner. I did'nt know whether to laugh or cry. The former I was about doing, when Margery's misery prevented it. She looked up at me so pitiously." ," Oh, Mr. Kit-ugh-en-ugh-ry!" and then she went at it again,-enough to melt a stone. "Oh, Mr. Kitteu-ugh-ry!" sobbed the distressed damsel; "Just see my bran new bonnet." "How did it happen, Margery?"I asked. ,' Oh, I don't know!-boo-hoo-hoo-somebody must have tramped on it." "Very likely," said I, dryly; "But how did they do it."   AN UNFORTUNATE MAN.       71 "I left it on the stairs, when I ran down to open the door for Misses." "That was very careless, Margery!"I exclaimed; "You can't blame anybody but yourself, then." "At this she choked down her grief, and seemed to think I was about right. Just then Mrs. Sniggles called sharply for Margery, and I beat a hasty'retreat." Mr, Yoper had listened with a face expressive of much anguish; whether out of sympathy for Margery's affliction, or because the mild Havana and the brandy fumes were acting upon his weak stomach, has never transpired. He -nervously knocked the ashes off his cigar and laid it aside, and, pouring out a glass of water, swallowed it at a draught. "Kitteury," said he, feebly, "Ispoiled that bonnet!" "No;" said Kitteury, puffing vigorously, and blow- ing the clouds of smoke across the table, as if, indeed, to hide Mr. Yoper behind the sickening, stifling volume. "No," repeated Kitteury, incredulously, "You spoiled her bonnet?" Certainly," returned Mr. Yoper, with a slight hiccough. "How, my boy,?" "By accident. I stepped on the band-box when I went out last evening." Another hiccough. ' "Aha! ha! gad, Yoper, my lad, you're in for it, then. Margery spent all she had, I'll be bound, for  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC8357-00000039"/> 72      AN UNFORTUNATE MAN. that article. , She can't buy another. You won't see her go without, I know." "Of course not," answered Mr. Yoper. "I'll see to it." "How do you like the liquor, my boy, eh? Good, ain't it. Gad, no better to be found. And the cigars-fine flavor;. nice, ain't they?" "Very nice; very good," Kitteury," said Mr. Yoper in a very unsteady voice, at the same time thinking the brandy exceedingly mean stuff, and the cigars execrable. "Have another Havana?" asked Kitteury, passing a bundle. "I think not" to-night, or morning, which ever it is. Thank you, no; I'll not light another now. Too late, Kitteu-hic-ry." "Not late yet," said the latter; "let's see, my watch is somewhere. Oh, yes! gad, I left it at San- ply's to be mended--hands off, crystal split, &amp;c. What time is it, anyhow?" Mr. Yoper fumbled about his vest for several minutes; then leaned back, and looked all over his clothes, and felt in all his pockets half a dozen times, and hiccoughed and stared at- Kitteury, and turned red as he said very stupidly- "Why, it's gone!" "What's gone?"   AN UNFORTUNATE MAN.       73 "My watch. Here's part of the ribbon:; see, some- body's cut it." !"You don't say so," said Kitteury, examining the cut ribbon critically. "Sharp rascal--keen work, gad; split like a hair." Mr. Yoper- had little to say. His elegant gold hunting-case watch, full-jeweled, chronometer-balance, unequalled time-keeper, a present from his deceased aunt on his twenty-first birth-day, was gone. "Unfortunate; very. Monstrous bad luck, Yoper. I'm tremendously sorry-fact, I am," and Kitteury looked the personification of brotherly sympathy. "Wish I had seen the scoundrel," he continued, ' I'd have twisted his head off instanter." Mr. Yoper was in misery.   He was sick at heart and stomach-especially the latter. He  got up with great effort, and moved somewhat unsteadily towards the door, saying: "Good night, Kitteury--hic-I dov't feel exactly well-hic." "Will go, eh ! sorry--bye-bye!" and Kitteury bow- ed Mr. Yoper out.  "Hope you'll be well to-morrow." "Hope so, too, thank you," and Mr. Yoper hur- ried to his room. He  seemed badly affected by his misfortunes. After an unsuccessful effort to hang his coat on a large fly, which he mistook for a nail on the inside of his door, he tried several times to draw off his colored stockings with the boot-jack. Having 7  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC8357-00000040"/> 74      AN UNFORTUNATE MAN. turned the key, to lock his door before it was quite shut, he was unable to finish the operation; nor could he understand what was the trouble. He was obliged to leave it ajar. After a deal of strange manoeuver- ing, and repeated mistakes, Mr. Yoper tumbled into bed, half undressed, and so fell asleep. When he awoke, thie sun was streaming broadly into his room. The sounds which came up from the distant street, and the various noises in the house, attested the lateness of the hour for rising. Mr. Yoper opened his dull eyes, yawned, stretched, and finally sat up in bed, and looked vacantly about him, and curiously at the door, standing some three inches open. Not quite satisfied as to the state of things, he got up, and closing the door, locked it. Then he threw himself lazily into a chair, stretched his legs to their fullest extent, clasped his hands over his head, and leaning his chair back, closed his eyes, as if of a mind to try another nap. , A tap at the door aroused him. "Who's there?", he cried. "It's me, sir!" in a faint voice. "And who's-me?" very drowsily. "Margery, please sir!" "Well, what do you want?" "Why, sir, the breakfast can't be kept any longer."   AN UNFORTUNATE MAN.       75 "Then don't keep it,;'" aid Mr. Yoper, laconically. "Will you come down now?" "No!" is Very well, sir!" "Margery." "C Sir."                 - "Stop a moment. I'll open the door. I've some- thing to say to you." "Yes, sir i" Mr. Yoper drew on his wrapper, thrust his feet into very easy slippers, and opened the door. "Margery, my good girl, H-tramped up- your bonnet last evening, I believe, in my haste to be off. I'm very sorry I caused you so much trouble; but I'll pay for the damage. , What did it cost?" "It was more my fault, sir, than yours; I should have been more careful," said Margery, moved by Mr. Yoper's generosity. "!"--- 'Well, well, never mina now; it's done for, and you must have another. "What was the cost of it?" "Seven dollars, sir!" Mr. Yoper had been feeling in all his pockets dur- ing the latter part of this colloquy for his pocket- book, but it was not forthcoming. "Strange!" he  muttered, staring at Margery; "what could I  have done with it?" "What, sir?" innocently asked Margery.  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC8357-00000041"/> 76     QAN UNFORTUNATE MAN. "My pocket-book ; I never go out without it. It ought to be here," and Mr. Yoper placed his hand on the spot. "But it is not here now, and I did'nt touch it since I went out last night. Confound it,' he added, somewhat worried; 'where can it be?" "Stolen, perhaps!" suggested Margery. Mr. Yoper shut one eye, and looked at the little maid of all work. "Pickpockets!" said she. "Were you near any last night, sir? That is, I mean, in a crowd any- where?" "No!" answered Mr. Yoper, thoughtfully. "It must have dropped out, then," said the girl, eager to assist his memory. "No," said he, "that could not be. Margery!" "Sir!" "Say nothing about this to anybody. Mind, not a word to any living soul, d'ye hear'?" "Yes, sir!"  i I'll pay you the seven dollars this afternoon." "Thank you," said Margery, with a curtsey, and Mr. Yoper shut the door. He resumed his chair, and tried to think. Watch, pocket-book; money, all gone. 'A nice thing I've made of it, as usual," he murmured. "But how could I have lost them?" he said half aloud. "I can't think.!"--he tapped his nose, and seemed   AN UNFORTUNATE MAN.       " to be reviewing the events and places -of the last evening's jaunt to the tea-party. Suddenly he arose, exclaiming, "By jolly, that's it. Those rude fellows I met at the car-office. I remember now, how they ran against me.  One of them did the work, certain. I wish they had broken their necks." With this very kind wish he sat down again. Another thought now flitted' across his confused mind.  He thought of Banker Blobbs, and wondered what time it was. Scarcely had he wished for his watch when the neighboring clock struck eleven. "Gracious!" he exclaimed, jumping  briskly up; "so late! I'd no idea it was more than eight."' He seemed fully awake to the necessity of making all- speed, and rushed to and fro in the most desperate manner.   "Eleven o'clock," he repeated aloud;     l "thunder, I slept long.  W hat'll Blobbs say? Dear me, I've done it this time, certain." After incredi- bte deeds of rapidity, he completed a hasty toilet, and slipped out of the house, and almost ran to the office., He paused a  moment at the door to recover breath, then pushing it slyly open, stole timorously in, unper- ceived, to his desk. Banker Blobbs was in the little room, engaged. "Thank heaven for that," devoutly ejaculated Mr. Yoper, as he prepared to commence his daily routine  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC8357-00000042"/> 78      AN. UNFORTUNATE MAN. of copying. Blobbs had not heard him. He would begin his work, and the exact time -of his entrance would never be known. There was a clock in the office, but Mr. Yoper zealously avoided observing it, that he might say he did not know what time it was when he came in, if questioned by Banker Blobbs. He removed his coat, and donned his 'desk-rig; and seizing a pen, ran his fingers through his hair, and commenced writing. He had a round, iron paper- weight, which was on the top of his desk. A strong breeze was blowing through the open widow, in front of his position, lifting the papers, and wafting them about the room. He reached for the paper-weight, but failing to secure a firm hold, it slipped from his fingers, rolled over the desk, and banged with terrific sound on the floor, whence it trundled the entire length of the room. 'Mr. Yoper; in the heat of the moment, permitted some profane expressions to escape his white lips, as he eyed the run-away weight. "Mr. Yoper," cried a shrill voice. "Yes, sir," answered that individual, getting off his stool, and advancing to the door of the private office, where Banker Blobbs sat in state before a green-cover- ed table, overspread with innumerable documents. "You're very late to-day. What time did you come to work?" "Some--I don't just know the hour, sir."   AN UNFORTUNATE MAN.       79 "What kept you away?" "Very sick--cramp-cholera-up nearly all night -no sleep, sir. Feel bad now. Scarcely able to sit up without a support for my back." Banker Blobbs did not seem  cross nor outraged. On the contrary, he appeared rather sad. He went on- "I feel sorry to tell you, Mr. Yoper, you've lost a splendid post through this tardiness. You remember having once spoken to me about the position of teller in the Haymarket Bank 2" "Yes, sir." "The cashier was in here this morning, to offer it to you. Their teller is dead, and they need somebody at once. He came to me first, because Hbhad on two occasions brought the matter to his mind." Mr. Yoper bowed, and acknowledged his gratitude. "He would have taken you at once--to-day. Salary two thousand dollars." Mr. Yoper groaned inwardly, and looked ready to cry. "Sorry," said Blobbs; "-that is all." Mr. Yoper returned to his desk and placed his head upon his crossed arms. He did not move for more than twenty minutes. His cup of misery was nearly full,--a bitter draught and a deep one. But he was not to drink it quite yet. He thought j'-  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC8357-00000043"/> 80      AN UNFORTUNATE MAN. of the charming widow, and it afforded him comfort. She loved him-that he knew; and was ready to tell him so, that admitted of no doubt. She only wished to teaze him a little. He was to visit her that evening, and she would accept his love, and acknowledge herf own for him. Blissful thought! He would soon handle her money, and buy a dozen watches, and fill a score of pocket-books. Then he would have no further need to drudge for Banker Blobbs, at a very moderate income. He would not have cause to sigh at losing the tellership of the Haymarket Bank. So pleasing were these thoughts; that Mr Yoper raised his head and whistled- in a low tone, however, for Banker Blobbs' detested whistling. Then he threw open his books cheerfully, and scribbled away at his entries of names and amounts of credit. The widow and her fortune were not for- gotten. A gentleman entered, and asked for Mr. Blobbs. Mr. Yoper pointed to the private-room, and turned to resume his work. What ailed him? Why did he turn very red, and then very white? twitch his mouth, and moisten his eyes, and grow very nervous altogether? and stare so strangely at the quiet pages before him?-What saw he there? Ah! what? All through the list of names he had, written,-here and there-Joe Yoper, one hundred thousand dollars. Ten times it was there. His mind had been on the fortune instead of his work. What should he do now? A   AN UNFORTUNATE MAN..      s puzzling question, indeed. The pages were numbered. If he should cut one out it would be noticed. The paper would not stand erasures. He could not remedy. the mistakes in that way. He pondered for some minutes, and concluded to take out the page, which he did very neatly. "There!" he murmured; "I think that will do."       .. There was no further disaster, and Mr. Yoper worked away, until half-past twelve, at which time Banker Blobbs came out of his room and said, with due cere- mony, just as he haddone and said every day, for ten years, "Mr Yoper!" "Yes, sir." "I am going to dinner."  When he had disappeared, Mr. Yoper descended from his high stool, placed his pen behind his ear,- ready for an emergency, and ensconced himself com- fortably in a cushioned chair. A  form darkened the doorway, and a voice said, "How are you now, my boy?" "Ah! Kitteury, come in." Kitteury walked in, and took the opposite chair, with a  pleasant nod. "Heard anything of your watch, Yoper?" "No; how could I?" ' "How could you, sure enough!" returned the visiter,  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC8357-00000044"/> 82     AN UNFORTUNATE MAN. looking attentively at the carpet; "Guess you'll never hear of it!" "I don't expect to," answered Mr. Yoper, resign- edly. "Bumpers and Jiggs are coming 'round to-night, to play euchre. I've counted you in.--All right, ain't it?" "Why no! I'm engaged this evening--up town." "'Pshaw!-particularly?" "Very."-Mr. Yoper blushed. "Going courting, Eh! Sly dog, Yoper,'cunning fellow," said Kitteury, playfully. Mr. Yoper blushed deeper, and looked -directly at the green wafer-box; "Come, come, Yoper; who is your intended? tell us." " I'd better not." "Why?" "Oh, because." "An excellent reason, indeed!" said Kitteury; " but you'll not put me off in that style; you must tell me." "Not yet; you must wait a bit." "Must I?" retorted Kitteury, slyly; "must I, in- deed! We'll see." "What do you mean?" "I know her!" "Kitteury!" "Sir!"   AN UNFORTUNATE MAN.       83 "You don't know her!" "I do, I tell you; better than yourself. A little bird told me*" Kitteury tapped Mr. Yoper pleasantly on the knee with a long ruler, and chuckled at his discomfiture. "Well, then; what do you think of my prospects?" "Poor!" "Poor!" echoed Mr. Yoper; "Come, no nonsense. Don't jest." "I'm in earnest, said Kitteury; -"You are going to marry the widow of the lamented Mr. Grumby." "Perhaps." "For beauty?" "No." "Accomplishments?" "Not exactly."' "Good qualities?" "Pshaw!" W What then,--true love?' "She's rich,-large estate." Kitteury shut his eyes, and throwing his head back, laughed heartily. Mr. Yoper looked funny. "How much do you set her down for?" asked Kit- teury.                - "Oh, I don't know!-hundred thousand or so.', "You're wrong; she's not worth five hundred. I  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC8357-00000045"/> 84      AN UNFORTUNATE MAN. know all about her. I heard of your performance last night.-You're in for it. Don't coun t on the fortune, however;-gad, you'll be out. Hav'nt proposed yet, have you?"               J "Blame it; yes," exclaimed Mr. Yoper, very much exercised. "I was under the impression that she is. rich, and was anxious to secure the prize. I'm afraid I'm too late in learninig differently." Mr. Yoper's voice was low and sad; and he looked very wo-begone. "My luck!" he aid; "Always wrong.-What's the use, Kitteury? I can't help my- self. Its my luck!" Kitteury coughed as he rose from the chair, and patted his excited friend on the shoulder. "Never meet trouble at the door. Gad, she'll re- fuse you yet!" "'No fear of that," groaned Mr. Yoper. "Don't be too sure,-keep up a good heart! Bye- bye," and Kitteury was gone. Mr. Yoper had no further time for misery. Banker Blobbs came in, and required some important writing done, which kept him at the desk until evening. After tea he started for the widow's home, agreeably to promise. He prayed most sincerely that she might be out, or very much engaged; or, if in and at liberty to see him, that she might answer, 'no.' Anything to release him! He paused before the door to think a   AN UNFORTUNATE MAN.       85 moment. A di'm light was visible, through the half- turned slats of the venitian blinds at the parlor windows. Some one was warbling a touching melody. Mr. Yoper stood under the window irresolute, until a man ap- peared, coming up the street. He mounted the steps, and placed his trembling hand on the bell-handle. He could hear the words of the ballad, "I'll give to thee this hand of mine!" "I'm sorry for that," thought Mr. Yoper; "I'd sooner you'd keep it." He was on the point of leaving the step to extend his walk, until he could collect himself for the inter- view, when the door was opened very suddenly and noiselessly. He started involuntarily, and quite lost his presence'of mind. It was the widow's sister that came out. Mr. Yoper was caught; he took off his hat, and bowed; and asked to see the widow.  "Was she at home?" She was; and he entered. Very soon he was in her presence. She looked nice in her well-fitting black silk, with flounces, and her hair done up in braids. But his love was cold, and he had little to say. She had evidently prepared herself to please her lover, but it had the opposite effect upon him. Mr. Yoper knew his fate when he saw her languishing eyes. He saw 8  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC8357-00000046"/> 86      AN UNFORTUNATE MAN. himself in the toils without a hope of escape. But it is unnecessary to tell all they said. Let it suffice, that, on his return Mr. Yoper met Kitteury, and taking him. aside, said, in a mournful tone, "Kitteury, she said, 'Yes."' Kitteury tried to comfort him, but in vain. Mr. Yoper had met with his greatest misfortune.   IN the winter of 1830, whilst travelling in the Mid- dle States, I had occasion to journey from Paxton to Mount Pleasant, a distance of fifty-six miles. Upon calling at the office in the afternoon to book myself for the morning stage, I was informed that the regis- ter was full. Returning to the inn, I seated myself before a glowing fire in the bar-room, to consider what I should do, as I was anxious to proceed homeward. As the stage did not go every day, I would be obliged to remain in my present quarters two days, a loss of time I could ill afford. "Landlord," said I, as that worthy came in short- ly after, "I am anxious to proceed to Mount Pleasant. The stage is full for to-morrow. and I am left behind. Is there any way by which I can manage to reach Au- burn? Perhaps I can meet the 'Eastern Line' there." "Well, now, sir, let me see. Sometimes we have a neighbor or a traveler going that way in his own con- veyance, who would, no doubt, cheerfully accommo- date you with a seat. But I can't say if there is any one going to-morrow.  I'll keep a lookout, though- perhaps I shall hear of some one to-night."  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC8357-00000047"/> 88      TiRE PHANTOM IIAND. "Do," I answered; "I shall esteem it a favor, and am ready to pay for the ride." Leaving orders to have a room prepared for my night's sojourn, and to have supper served there at seven o'clock, I'atrolled out for a walk. Upon my re- turn I noticed a handsome coach in the yard of the inn. The ostler was watering two splendid horses, under the eye of a quiet, modest-looking man, in dark, plain livery. "Heigho!" thought I, "we shall have nome noble company this evening. I wonder how many?" and thus musing I passed through the entry and to my- room. At supper time a servant came in with a tray, and whilst he arranged the table I asked, "Who arrived in the coach I observed in the yard?" "A gentleman, sir-alone.' "Will- he remain all night?" "Yes,: sir." In a few moments my meal was ready. Requesting the servant to bring me some needed article, I seated myself, and was about eating, when he re-entered and, handed me a slip of paper.

THE PHANTOM HAND.      89 I read the note, and looked inquiringly at the servant who said, "The gentleman, sir, about whom you asked awhile ago gave that to .me, and bade me say he will be in all the evening." "Show me his room," said I, rising from my un- tasted supper. I soon found myself confronted with the individual in question. He was standing with his back to the fire when I opened the door, but at once advanced gracefully and courteously, and extended his hand, "My name is Grey," said I, shaking his hand. "I am pleased to know you, Mr. Grey," said he, pleasantly. "Pray be seated." "One moment, sir, if you please;"I responded; "have you supped?" "Not yet." "Well, then," I continued, "I have just had sup- per served in my room, and came to beg you will honor me with your company, if agreeable. I always enjoy a meal better with a companion. You Will come?" "With pleasure," he answered, smilingly; and in: a few moments we were enjoying the substantial food set forth by mine host. I now had opportunity to observe my companion thus suddenly acquired. He was of middle size, spare and pale looking, with 8*  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC8357-00000048"/> 90      THE PHANTOM HAND. a sad expression of countenance. His face had evident- ly once been handsome, but was now careworn and fur- rowed. His hair, which had been very black, was plen- tifully tinged with grey. His manners and dregs betokened him a man of good breeding and wealth; and his conversation and address indicated liberal edu- cation and refinement s Graceful, polite, attentive, easy in conversation, -and genial, he appeared alto- gether a gentleman and a scholar. Having seated himself, he remarked, in a quiet way. "Whilst conversing with the landlord, just after my arrival, I learned that you are very anxious to pursue your projected journeyin the morning, and of the dilemma you are in. As I shall pass through Auburn to-morrow, permit me to offer you a seat in my car- riage." "How shall I thank you, sir?"I said, quickly; you relieve me very much." a"Never mind the thanks, Mr. Grey," he replied "You are welcome, indeed. I shall be glad to have company, and I to be able to serve you."' After supper we chatted for an hour or two, making ourselves better acquainted. As we were about parting for the night, I said, "One moment Mr. Johnson; I wish you would try a very nice wine I have with me. It will assist you to sleep."   THE PHANTOM HAND.       91 "  Thank you," he answered, accepting the proffered glass, "Your health," said I, raising mine. He bowed, raised his glass, and had placed it to his lips, when with a choking, rattling sound of his throat his face assuming the appearance of a man, being stran- gled, horribly contorted and livid, he dropped the glass, which was shivered against the chair, and stag- gering, would have fallen, but that I recovered my self-possession and caught him in an instant. I was strong, and easily carried him to bed, where, having laid him, I turned to summon aid; but, as my hand touched the bell cord, he opened his eyes, and in a husky voice begged me not to alarm the house. Ile said he felt better, and would be quite well in a short time. "No uncommon occurence, sir," he said, in answer to my look of inquiry. "I have been so troubled for nearly five years." "Indeed!"I exclaimed. He said nothing more, nor did I';- after a brief rest he  arose---ade me good night-rand moved toward the door. "But my dear sir, are you not afraid of a return?" I  asked; "you must not be left alone, to-night." "I shall not have it again to-night," he answered, in a sad, hurried tone, and was gone.  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC8357-00000049"/> 92      THE PHANTOM HAND. There seemed something strange about the affair; no apparent cause for the strangling, his distressing suffering, his sudden recovery, and his assurance that he should iot have it again that night, led me to sit and muse upon it for more than an hour, after his departure. X The next morning, we met after breakfast, and he appeared in excellent health, and tolerable good spirits. At the appointed hour, we started, and arrived at Auburn, without accident or incident; here, however, my bad luck had preceded me, and I found the stage had gone through an hour previously. Upon hearing this, my amiable companion said: "Do not be annoyed, I will escort you to Mount Pleasant; do not refuse me the pleasure." I acquiesced, and after a pleasant, ride we reached Mouat Pleasant, towards evening. We stopped to- gether and arranged to have rooms adjoining. We ate supper, in company, and after a very agreeable evening, separated without any thing occuring to mar our comfort. I found it necessary to remain more thfn a week in Mount Pleasant, a nd my friend remained also; he had before informed me, that he was traveling for pleas- ure, and had leisure for anything. We had become quite intimate friends--indeed I considered myself fortunate in making his acquaintance; he had been a   THE PIIANTOM HAND.       93 wanderer over all Europe, and was a keen observer of men and things; he had a fund of instructive, enter- taining, and amusing subjects for conversation. We always took our meals in company. It was the last evening of our stay. After an unu. * sually pleasant evening he retired at nine o'clock, to arrange for his departure in the morning. Having letters to write I pushed the table nearer the fire, drew up a cosy arm chair, and adjusting my materials, was soon busily engaged. Time slipped by unthought of. A violent rap arrested my pen, and I hurried and opened the door. Mr. Johnson came in, in a hurried, excited manner. He had not undressed. His face was very pale, and his eyes were strangely bright and open. Motioning me to close the door, which I still held open, he took my hand in both of his, deathly cold and clammy, and said, quietly, but clearly, "My dear Mr. Grey, you will pardon my interrup- tion when I shall have explained. I admired you from the beginning of our intercourse. I have since esteemed you as- a friend. Circumstances render it obligatory upon me to make you my confident in a matter hitherto locked in my own heart chamber. Will you accept of my trust? Will you be my nearest friend now and to the last?" He held my hand during the delivery of these words,  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC8357-00000050"/> "      THE PIIANTOM HAND. and now pressed it nervously, looking beseechingly into my face. I could not refuse, and answered, "( To serve you, I will do all in my power." "Thank you," he said, in a tone and manner ex- pressing much gratitude. Dropping my-hand he waved me to a seat, and taking , a chair opposite, said: "I must make you acquainted, in brief, with the history of my life. I will try not to weary you. What time have you?" I looked at my watch, and lo! it was past midnight. I was surprised at the hour, but remained silent. He drew a deep sigh, and began his story. I am an Englishman by birth, but have lived away from England half my days. My family is of noble blood, and rank high in respectability'and wealth. An only son, I was indulged by every one. I grew up self-willed, passionate, and dissolute. I had a friend about three years my senior, who loved me with a brother's affection. He was exactly my opposite in habits, but we usually agreed very well. We were seldom separated, at home or abroad. I early acquired a fondness for cards, and after attaining my majority, and a handsome income from property left to me by an aunt, I indulged in gambling, unrestrained. My friend alone sought every opportunity to save me from   THE PHANTOM HAND.       95 the ruin I was bringing upon myself. He followed me everywhere, like a shadow; plead, argued, warned, entreated, wept--yes, even that he did, but in vain. I seemed possessed by a demon. Losing large sums, I hid my trouble in the wine cup. One night whilst in Paris I slipped away from my friends and joined a card party at a private house. I lost considerable money, and drank frequently. I soon became confus- ed and angry, and lost every time. But I resolved to outdare them all. Calling that I would double the last stake-a heavy amount'-I was about making a muddled, ruinous play, when a hand seized my cards and scattered them with the balance of the pack. Turning around, beside myself with passion, I saw my friend standing with folded arms and sad countenance behind my  chair. "Fool! I hissed, and struck him a violent blow in the face. "He did not resent it, save by look, and begged me to go with him to the hotel. His manner, and the jests and taunts of my drunken comrades, mad- dened me the more, and I cursed him for interfering. My cap had fallen to the floor, without reply he stooped to pick it up. With the fury of a maniac I threw myself upon him-coward that I was to take him at a disadvantage--and bore him to the floor. Grasping his throat I pressed and clinched it fiercely, sinking my knee in his breast. My   companions, as soon as !  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC8357-00000051"/> 96      THE PHANTOM HAND. they comprehended the affair, dragged me off. I stood back for him to rise, but he lay-there motionless. He was dead-murdered by me! Oh, God! that I have lived to tell it!" Here my narrator stopped, overcome by his feelings, and dropping his head upon his trembling hands, shook all over like an aspen leaf. I was'seized with horror at the recital of ,his base conduct. Starting up, I walked the room rapidly, doubting my senses. But, as I remembered his early education, his lack of parental love and care, and his being under the influence of liquor when he committed the act, I turned again to look on his misery, when he resumed : "Pity me! Ohj if you but knew how I repented it the instant reason returned! If you could know what I suffered then, and every day since, you-but let me finish--time is very precious." I had/ again seated myself, and was ready to hear all. He continued: "Upon seeing my work, I was sobered at once. I need not depict my sorrow, anguish, remorse, an(d fear. I would have counted it bliss to have given my' life then, to undo my terrible crime. "6 I remained in Paris only long enough to see my victim's body secretly buried. My three comrades in gambling assisted me, and promised never -to reveal   THE PHANTOM HAND.       :97 the circumstance. I hastened to England, andexcused my friend's absence in some well-arranged story, and no questions were asked to give me uneasiness. "Now began a series of fearful visitations, that speedily unmanned me, and rendered my life a curse. The first time was in this wise: One evening, just one month from the fatal evening in Paris, a small com- pany assembed at our house in honor of my return. My father had given a toast; all were waiting for me to respond.  I arose, but as I opened my lips to speak, I saw a bodyless hand--that of my murdered friend- stretched forth toward mDe. It grasped my throat with a vice-like grip. I felt myself being strangled, suffocated, dying. The hand clutched me about half a minute, but the agony and pain I endured is beyond description.  Falling-I was caught by my servant, and carried to a  sofa. I recovered almost immedi- ately, and found some means to excuse the occurrence, and allay the excitement of the guests-. I hid my ter- rible secrets in my heart, and to this hour have kept them from every one. Forty-nine times have I been visited and punished by the bodyless hand. Every- where it has come upon me, in the crowded hall and when alone, at noonday; and in the silent watches of the night. You can now easily comprehend the occur- rence on the evening of our first meeting. I  left England -four months ago, and came here to travel. 9  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC8357-00000052"/> 98      THE PHANTOM HAND. Only in constant change and excitement could I bear to live. Several times have I been on the point of ending my life and my misery together, but some vague fear prevented me. The time you were witness to my visitation, was the first for four months. I had' even begun to hope my punishment had sufficed-that the persecutor was satisfied, and at rest. But alas! you know how bitterly I have been disappointed. And now I am nearly done." He paused, and gazed awhile fixedly into the coals before us. Then heaving a sigh, and without lifting his eyes, he said calmly, "What I have told you is truth, and what I shall now tell you is truth. Once more, making the fiftieth time, the hand will come, and for the last visit. In twenty-four hours I shall be strangled to death! God help me!"  I looked -at my watch-it was just two o'clock. What could I do or say? I began to think of crazy men-of strange meetings with mania-cs--and a feel- ing of uneasiness crept over me. He was not affected, not agitated, but calm and resigned. I was about to rouse myself to speak against entertaining such a foolish idea, but he waved me to be silent, and con- tinued: "My story is told. I am alone in this country, and need a friend to perform for me some little acts of   THE PHANTOM  HAND.      99 kindness. May I dare to request you to be that friend? Can you pity and forgive my sin, which has been truly repented of?" I assured him I would do whatever he requested, for I believed him to be deranged, and determined to soothe rather than irritate his sensitive nature, until I could think what to do for him. He clasped my hand, with many fervent protestations of gratitude, and then retired. Being busily engaged all the next day, we did not meet until evening. He met me cordially, and seemed in good spirits. He entrusted me with a number of letters, to be sent to England, and one for myself, concerning the disposal of his body and personal effects. I confess I smiled as I thrust them all into a corner of my trunk, thinking he would laugh also when I should bring them to him the next day. That evening we supped together as usu'al. Know-b ing the evil, and sometimes fatal effects of intense anxiety and fear upon a diseased: mind and weakened system, I was anxious that my unfortunate friend should sleep all night. But before supper he had assured me he could not rest, and would sit up until the fatal hour-two o'clock. I therefore had a harmless soporific secretly con- veyed into his glass at the table, to assist him to sleep.  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC8357-00000053"/> 100      THE PHANTOM HAND. He drank it, and in an hour thereafter complained of being sleepy, and threw himself upon my bed. I omitted towind my watch, in case he should by any chanceawake too soon, and ask the hour. Raking the fire into a cheerful blaze, I ensconced myself- in my chair, and proceeded to read. How long I read I know not. I had fallen asleep, and awoke with a start, when my book fell on the floor. I was thoroughly awake at once, and felt possessed by a strange fear of something about to transpire, beyond my power to prevent. It grew upon me, until for relief I roused up and advanced to the bed. He was sleeping quietly and naturally. "3 Bah!"I murmured. "I'm weak-minded myself!' I, began to think of going to sleep in earnest, and wondered what was the time of night.. Recollecting I had noticed a great clock in the landlord's room, directly opposite my own, I opened the doorE quietly, and looked over. A bright light shone under his door. I slipped across the hall, and knocked. He opened it in a moment, and expressed surprise at seeing me. "Why, Mr. Grey," said he, '"you're up late! Are you sick?" "No," I answered, " my watch is not going. What time is it, please?'   THE PHANTOM HAND.       101 "Half after twelve," he replied, and added, "I am up late, too. I slept so long this afternoon that I am not ready for bed even." "That's just my trouble," said I; "I Am too wide awake to think of bed. Can't you come over to my room awhile? We'll keep each other company until we talk ourselves sleepy." He accepted my proposition, and we drew our chairs to the fire, and conversed in a moderate tone for an hour. The landlord was an intelligent man, an acquaintance of several years standing. I always stopped with him when in Mount Pleasant, which was two or three times a year. I enjoyed his conversa- tion, and when he had finished a short yarn of his expe- rience at tavern-keeping, I resolved to let him into the affair of my friend, so far as his phantasy was concerned. I was not bound to secresy, and I knew "mine host" to be discreet, and able to keep a secret. I informed him in a few words of the fact that Mr. Johnson was then in my bed, and related some other items connected with his being there. He listened with due -gravity, but agreed with me that our friend was demented, and that all would be right to him in the morning. We continued conversing until the landlord said, "Let us peep in at our neighbor."' We advanced -to the bedside very softly, and drew aside the curtain. 9*  &#xD;<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC8357-00000054"/> 102  c    THE PHANTOM HAND. He was still sleeping easily, with a placid counte- nalnce. ' You see," said I, in a whisper, "all is right so,. far. Whatv time have you? It must- " I stopped short, for I had been looking at the sleep- er's face all the time, and was speechless at the change that took place. Instead of repose and peace, the face was' contorted, and almost black; the eyes were wide open, and stony, and the tongue protrud-, ing. To every appearance, he was being chocked to death. I instantly raised him up-but it was of no use. A brief, painful struggle, a gasp or two, and he was dead! Shuddering, I laid the corpse back on the pillow, and turned to the landlord. - He said not a word, but held out his watch. It was two o'clock. There was a surgeon stopping over night in the house. We called him up. He came immediately. "Ah!;' said he; " apoplexy-poor fellow!" And in my heart I echoed, "Poor fellow!" but I knew it was not apoplexy.   IN Marbleton village, lived Jonas Lair, a poor, but honest and happy tailor. He was not poor through lack of industry; neither from habits of prodigality or dissipation; but because the good people of Marbleton knew but little of the fashions and follies of the gay world, beyond the precincts of their somewhat an- tiquated village, and were not accustomed to make frequent changes in their apparel. They patronized Jonas Lair's little shop only when absolute necessity obliged them to do it; so that the honest man of the needle had no opportunity to grow rich. He, however, enjoyed a comfortable living, and being of very mode- rate desires, was content. His obliging and quiet dis- position made him a favorite with the villagers; and never a day passed but Jonas Lair could boast of a visit from the squire, the doctor, the parson, or the school-master; all honored and great men in Marbleton. He very seldom left his shop-board to walk through the village, or to stand and gossip at the "Blue Plough; the village accommodation for man and beast." Early and late he patiently stitched and patched dilapidated coats and threadbare breeches, or an occasional new garment was fabricated, and he aspired no higher. But Jonas  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC8357-00000055"/> 104     JONAS LAIR'S FORTUNE. Lair was destined to a better fate; and although the fickle Goddess, who makes and unnikes poor mortals, had neglected, she had not forgotten him. He was a young man, of eight and twenty years,- not ill-looking; modest and unassuming, and unmarried. One beautiful afternoon in early summer, Jonas sat upon his worn board, perplexing his constructive faculty upon the alteration of a vest, which a stout old farmer had left with directions, to make it up as a jacket for his last born, a boy of twelve years. He had often rmade similar changes. The worthy inhabitants of Marbleton were very economical, and the necessarily cast-off clothes of the parents, very frequently re-appeared in different forms upon the growing bodies of their children. But in this instance, Jonas was a little puzzled. The blunt old farmer had said, "Make it right new, you know, for Johnny is to go to town next week on a visit to his aunt, who is a trifle particular in these matters. You can easy do it--plenty of stuff," laughed the stout farmer. But when the tailor had taken the vest apart, he found it much worn where it most needed to be good; and the great pockets had caused unseemly gaps in the cloth, which stared the honest knight of the goose quite out of his usual equanimity. He turned mechanically to the window, and gazed .abstractedly out upon the deserted street, the while resting his head on his joined hands, and his elbows on his knees. Suddenly his pale   JONAS LAIR'S FORTUNE.     105 face flushed, his mouth twitched nervously, and his eyes were lit with a new brilliancy. He leaned forward to look through the window-then vaulted from his board in an instant, and ran to the door. He stood there some minutes, looking earnestly up the street. Now the cause of this sudden change from apathy to activity was this: As he had sat vacantly looking out into the street, a very handsome, bright-eyed, rosy-cheeked maiden passed by the large window, and turning her head, looked in.-- She gave the tailor a very pleasant nod, and a far more pleasant smile. They operated upon him like a charm. "Such a beauty!" he exclaimed, as he made the bound for the door, to follow with his eyes her retreating form. She went on until she had passed the Post Office, then turned and retraced her steps. "She will pass here again," murmured the tailor, and he darted in and hurried to the back part of his little shop, where he combed out his hair, put on his best coat and his boots; straightened out the bow of his neck-cloth, and finally resumed his position in the door-way.- She came nearer, with a graceful easy walk, and a self-composed manner, which rather disconcerted the modest tailor, He was very desirous of catching a sight of her sweet face again in a sly way, and thought he could readily do it. But as she drew near, his natural bashfulness was too much for his courage, and he cast ,.r.  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC8357-00000056"/> 106     JONAS LAIR'S FORTUNE. about for some excuse for being out. Happily, the sign swinging above the door afforded an opportunity for remaining. It appeared to need some adjustment. He brought out a chair, and standing upon it, seemed busy, just when the lady came up. But the tailor felt sure she ws watching him, and he feared to turn his head. She was by in another moment, and his chance was lost. He continued to stand upon the chair and gaze after her until she was out of sight. Then, with a great sigh he dismounted, when his attention was attracted to an article lying upon the sidewalk, in front of his door. It was a snowy, delicate little handker- chief; rich in a sweet fragrance. Gently lifting it, Jonas kissed it twice, and carefully placed it inside of his vest, on the left side. Heaving another sigh, he entered his shop and resumed his occupation. The lady was a stranger in Marbleton; that Jonas knew. But why she had nodded and smiled at him, and so sweetly too, he could not tell. It was quite a joy to think about it. And-so he sat for a long time motionless, indulging in the thought, and wishing he could see-her again. The worthy tailor had never been in love, and knew very little about it. But now he did not feel quite as he had felt before. The little shop seemed dull and uninviting, and he did not much like sitting there alone.   JONAS LAIR'S FORTUNE.     107 Neither was he so contented and satisfied with himself and his business. Wherever he turned he saw bright eyes and red cheeks, and a beautiful tempting mouth, and a loveable face, altogether. He began to wonder at himself, and then he said, "Pshaw!" not very loud, and gave the old vest a vengeful snip, which came very near doing some damage. Then his reveries were interrupted by the entrance of the parson, who kept him busy talking until the time for his evening repast. After which, Jonas resumed his work,'and his thoughts; without accomplishing the first, or arriving at any conclusion from the other. Two days--tediously slow days, rolled away, and in all that time Jonas did little else but muse and sigh, and muse again; without exactly knowing why he did so. He kissed the snowy handkerchief when he awoke in the morning, and the last thing before sinking into sleep at night. It was a sacred thing to the tailor, and he treasured it carefully, and valued it above money. But he was not forgetful that he must work if he would eat, and so he managed to solve the difficult problem of the old vest and the new jacket; and the latter was neatly done. On the third morning after his adventure, the tailor sat at his task. He had taken up the steaming goose to smooth out the wrinkles in the new jacket, when a sweet voice said:  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC8357-00000057"/> JONAS LAIR'S FORTUNE. " Good morning, sir !" Jonas dropped the goose-fortunately not on the troublesome garment just finished, and flushing in the face, said," Good morning !" to a pair of very bright eyes; for he, poor man, did not see anything else. Before him was the subject of his much thinking,- the lady of his dreams. She was very handsome, and as she stood there, in the little shop, everything ap- peared brighter and pleasanter for her presence. Jonas remembered his position the next moment, and came down from his board, and brought out his nicest chair, and having dusted it with his handkerchief, begged her to accept a seat. " Thank you !" she said, taking the proffered chair. "I have a little business for you, if you have leisure now." " It will afford me pleasure to attend to you at once," answered Jonas, gallantly. His visiter smiled as she asked- " Can you do my work right away ?" "Yes, ma'am; I think so." "I wish to have a coat -made for a little boy-my nephew, who lives where I am residing at present. Have you cloth suitable ?" "Yes, ma'am," and Jonas produced his goods for her inspection. She chose a piece, and gave her orders, leaving an old coat to go by. She told him she in-   JONAS LAIR'S FORTUNE.         109 tended the new garment as a surprise to her nephew, and that was why she had not brought him to be measured. She feared she would make him unneces- sary trouble by such a procedure, but Jonas assured her she would not. That he could do it just as well. She told him all she required, and desiring him to bring it home when done, if not inconvenient; was going out, when he said, " Pardon me; is not this your handkerchief?" She told him it was, and that she had been so sorry, thinking she had lost it forever. It was a present, and she valued it very much. She thanked him twice, and smiling, bowed, and was gone. Jonas was rejoiced at her visit, but sorry he had parted with the handkerchief. He had nothing be- longing to her, now. Nothing he could kiss, and imagine it nectar. But he had seen her again, and that was something; and when the coat was done he would see her again; and that was a great deal more. So he went to work on the new order immediately, and gave extra time and attention to executing the job in an unexceptionable style of workmanship, for her sake. When it was finished, he wrapped it up neatly, and having made an unusually particular toilet, wended his way to the house designated. His rap brought the lady herself, to the door. 10 &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC8357-00000058"/> "O     JONAS LAIR'S FORTUNE. She received Jonas pleasantly, and invited him into the parlor. "My nephew is not at home," said she; "He has gone to the mill with his father. When he returns I will have him try it on, and will apprised you of the result to-morrow, or, in a day or two." "Very good, ma'am!" answered the tailor, taking up his hat to depart; but before he had made'a step, Mrs. Green, the mistress of the house, came in. He knew her well. She shook his hand cordially, and exclaimed : "Why, Hetty! I didn't know you were acquainted with Mr. Lair; I thought you were an entire stranger here. How- is this, Mr. Lair? Eh! You know my niece?" "Only in the way of business, Mrs. Green," an- swered Jonas. And then Hetty was obliged to make explanation of her intention to make Tommy Green a present of the coat, by way of a surprise to all hands; which was the only acquaintance she had the pleasure of enjoying with Mr. Lair. The tailor listened, in a strange state of feeling, to this confession. The old flush suffused his face when Hetty spoke of his acquaintance being any pleasure to her. "Well!" spoke out Mrs. Green; "You must know   JONAS LAIR'S FORTUNE.     1ll each other better.-This is Hetty Somers-- my niece, Mr. Lair! Mr. Lair, Hetty, is a particular friend of Mr. - Green."' Miss Somers acknowledged the introduction in. a becoming manner, and Jonas was much delighted. Mrs. Green remained a short time in the parlor, and then declaring she had bread in the oven, hurried away, and left the new friends to become better acquainted. Jonas did not find it a difficult business, with such a- pleasing, amiable companion. He was soon at his ease, and enjoyed his good luck amazingly. When he withdrew from Mrs. Green's, hemhad to consider for some minutes whether he was not dream- ing. When quite assured that he was wide awake, he ^ began to recall Miss Hetty's kindness and pleasantry, until he felt that she might-may-be like him a little as a friend after a while. With such consolatory thoughts, he reached his shop. From this time he was a different man. A new existence opened up before him. He paid more atten- tion to dress and manners, and studied ease and conver- sational habits. He hunted out his old, dog-eared school-books, and polished up his almost rusted know- ledge. He was inlove, and there was something tan- gible about it. He had been duly presented to Miss Hetty's favorable notice. She had given him her  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC8357-00000059"/> "2     JONAS LAIR'S FORTUNE. hand in kindly grasp. She had talked and laughed with him, and had seemed to enjoy his company. And he was happy--very happy. Miss Hetty called twic' at. the little shop, after their acquaintance in Mrs. Green's parlor. Once, to sug- gest an alteration in the nephew's coat; and again, to make settlement. So they were becoming quite inti- mate. Mrs. Green took an interest. in Jonas, and Tommy Green brought him many an invitation -to a social meal. Mr. Green chucked him under the chin, and poked him in the ribs, and winked and giggled in such an uncommon and mysterious manner whenever they met, that the tailor began to think the poor old gentleman was getting childish, and felt sorry for him. As the weeks rolled on, Jonas became a frequent visitor at Mr. Green's, and, gradually acquired confi- dence and ease in the society of Miss Hetty, who ap- peared to relish his visits. As before mentioned, Jonas - was rather good-looking, and by no means ignorant. He was fond of a good joke, and abounded in humor- ous anecdotes, which he could relate in a very pleasing way. Things moved on in this wise, and the tailor began to feel himself a lover in earnest. He imagined that Miss Hetty looked favorably upon his suit, that told his love in actions, which certainly spoke plainer than words. But alas! that there should be so many verifications of the old adage--"that the course of   JONAS LAIR'S FORTUNE.     113 true love runneth not smooth.". A-cloud was lo6ming up in the horizon of the tailor's clear,/ sun-lit sky, which soon threatened to assume unpleasant pro- portionS. Jonas Lair's shop was at the lower end of the main street of the village. The upper end was more com- pactly built, and had the newest houses. The Blue Plough, the Post Office, Simon Sloan's store, the new church, and the school-house, were all there to adorn it. It was the aristocratic portion of the village ;and was rapidly becoming the spot for the men of wealth- the solid men of Marbleton. Jonas had often thought of moving up, but procrastination kept him in the old place.  It was the month of October, and things were unusu- ally lively in Marbleton. There would be a great fair in a neighboring town-Eagleton-in a few weeks, and the flaming posters, freely distributed, had aroused the Marbletonians. Extensive preparations were making to be there in good trim. In fact, the dwellers in the aforementioned'town of Eagleton, distant from Marble- ton about ten miles, had been rather free in speaking contemptuously of their neighbors-the Marbletonians. They had termed them ignorant, miserly, and old- fashioned. At which shabby talk the Marbletonians had been a trifle incensed; but as they had had little occasion to visit the people of Eagleton, they had 10*  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC8357-00000060"/> "4     JONAS LAIR'S FORTUNE. wisely borne the opprobrium in silence and indifference. But they were waking up at last. The great fair was to be " a sight to see," and everybody would go who could. So'there was a bustle and stir in the village. The men needed new and better clothes, and Jonas was as busy as a bee, and could not leave his shop an hour. One morning, two weeks before the time for the fair, the residents of the upper end of the village were sur- prised, and somewhat startled, to see a commotion in the long unoccupied store-room of widow Beam's house. The windows were being washed, the paint scrubbed, and the floor mopped. Everything betokened prepa- rations for a new-comer. And the new-comer came the next day. A spruce, handsome, polite, dapper young gentleman, who speedily made known his object in- thus disturbing the quiet of the aristocracy of Mar- bleton, by hanging out a sign-: SYDNEY JONES, Fashionable Tailor. Late of Eoagleton, and the deed was done. . Sidney Jones had a supercili- ous, confident manner, that seemed to say-" you will see what I shall do." He' fitted up the windows in gorgeous style, displaying bewitching patterns of vel- vets, silks, cassimeres, and cloths, so that the staid people of Marbleton began to waver in their belief in homespun and plain goods, still they preferred to o                  ,   JONAS LAIR'S FORTUNE.     115 patronize Jonas Lair, and perhaps would not have troubled Sydney Jones at all, had it not been that the capacity of the little shop was inadequate to furnish the work required. By degrees Sydney Jones acquired custom, and turned out elegant fits, and matchless fabrics, which won upon the hearts and pockets of nearly all Marbleton. But, with a few others, the squire, the parson, and the doctor, continued firm- allies to Jonas Lair, and ordered an extra suit each, to show their indifference to the supplanting powers of the," foppish tailor, late of Eagleton." "He is an up-start!" exclaimed the old squire, when the trio had convened in the tailor's shop, one dull evening. "Ah!" echoed the good parson; "The people are -running after vanity.-Their heads are turned to worldliness!" "He is a proud, conceited fool!" indignantly averred the doctor; "and ought not to be encouraged." So they talked and vented their dislike to the inno- vation upon Marbleton habits and customs; but the tailor continued to stitch and cut-and cut and stitch, and said not a word. Sydney Jones had a nonchalance about his move- ments that was truly refreshing to the astonished, simple folks of the quiet village, in which he had con- descended to open, his shop.     *    . t" , '  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC8357-00000061"/> JONAS LAIR'S FORTUNE. He ogled the modest maidens, and gossipped with the elderly: single ladies, and invited himself to meals with the matrons, in a manner that was irresistable. One evening, having an hour's spare time, Jonas thought of Miss Hetty, and concluded to pay her a brief visit. Having suitably attended to his appearance, he walked briskly up the street, and by the brilliant shop of his gay and successful rival, who was not in. Upon arriving at Mrs. Green's, who should he see in the parlor, entertained by Miss Hetty,-his heart's idol,- Sydney Jones. Alas! poor Jonas. Here was something unthought of, and consequently quite unexpected. But he could do no less than honor the introduction which Miss Hetty gave him. Mr. Jones was glad to know Jonas; at least he said so several times, and shook his hand warmly. He talked freely-about everything, and made himself quite agreeable. Jonas tried to do the same, but did not entirely succeed. He felt uncomfortable, and did not stay long. He returned to his shop, but he worked ro more that night. For several hours he sat before his bright fire, for the evening was chilly-musing upon the' condition of matters and things in Marbleton, since the advent of the fancy tailor, "Sydney Jones, late of Eagleton."   The next day he was surprised by a visit from his new acquaintance. Sydney Jones walked in with an easy, familiar nod; and, without invitation, seated himself in the nice chair, once used by Miss Hetty. Jonas Lair had formed a dislike to the new tailor from the first. Not so much on account of the injury done to his trade,-although that may have helped the feel. ing; but, because of the arrogance and conceit of the intruder upon the peace of Marbleton. But as Mr. Jones seemed desirous of being sociable and agreeable, Jonas did his part pleasantly and cheerfully; and the rival knight of the shears soon appeared to be quite intimate. After the first visit, Mr. Jones stopped in often; and occasionally his visits were honored with a return. With all his apparent perfection, Sydney Jones had some weak points which Jonas was not slow to discover. Although his conversation was well guarded, as a general thing, he sometimes showed himself up in a manner which proved him to be a mere adventurer. His hobby was money.-He wanted a fortune; either by marrying, or finding it suddenly, some other easy way. He was also very credulous when cautiously approached; and believed, to a certainty, that he would wake up some fair morning to find himself rich. One evening our friend, the-once happy tailor, sat   &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC8357-00000062"/> "8     JONAS LAIR'S FORTUNE. dreamily upon his board, with an unfinished coat thrown across his knee. The door was ajar, although the weather was not warm. "Pleasant thoughts to you, neighbor," awoke Mr. Lair from his reverie, and lie looked around to find Sydney Jones seated in the nice chair, looking as cheerful as a blue sky. ' Thank you," answered Jonas, quietly. ' You seemed to be dreaming nicely when I dis- turbed you. Of some lady-love, I dare say!" Jonas smiled, but made no answer. 'Nice town, this!" remarked Mr. Jones; "Nice people,-especially the ladies!" "Rather so;-I agree with you!" said Jonas. "Yes, sir; its a very pleasant spot. I think I'll live here forever.-Marry may-be. I'm charmed with a dozen pretty girls already; but there's one in -par- ticular I'm inclined to fancy more than the rest." "Ah!" "Yes, sir ;--Miss Somers! You know her too. She told me of your funny acquaintance. She's a beauty, and rich too I'm informed; but from what I can see, and I flatter myself I can see more than most people, she won't look at a poor man for a husband. She treats me well, I'll allow; but then she may think I have money, and she can see I am made of the right stuff to be wealthy some day not far distant. I hav'nt ,v ,   JONAS LAIR'S FORTUNE.     119 proposed yet, but I shall do it soon, I think. You know her pretty well. Now, what do you say? Won't I make a lucky hit?" "I have been very favorably impressed with Miss Somers," answered Jonas; too much amused to be alarmed at the intentions of his rival.  "Well! You'll find neighbor Jonas, I'll make her lMrs. Sydney Jones,--see if I don't." "If you can!" suggested Jonas. "Pooh, pooh!"   No trouble about it!" Jonas smiled at his visitor's, confidence, but said nothing. "I say, Lair! how is it you have lived here so many years, and not married yet?-Nice girls, rich papas; everything nice,-wonder you hav'nt arranged it long ago." "No hurry, sir!" answered the tailor, in his quiet way; "C Time enough, when I see my way clearer." "Yes; you're right! I'll agree," continued Sydney Jones; "It requires money, or, at least some address to'do the business."  The tone and manner of the Eagleton seceder seemed to indicate a very negative idea of the ability of the Marbleton gentlemen to manage matters of that nature. Jonas noticed it, but paid no attention to"the insinua, tion.  He seemed thinking of something else all the time they were talking, insomuch that his visiter said: A,  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC8357-00000063"/> 120     JONAS LAIR'S FORTUNE. "You haven't got over your dream yet, neighbor?" At the word dream, Jonas started, and looked curi- ously at the speaker. "What's the trouble?" continued Sydney Jones:, "Some scheme to become rich, suddenly? or, perhaps you're in love, after all. Come now; I imparted my secret to you: play'fair, and let me hear what you're thinking of so seriously. I'm sure it must be love- thoughts you're indulging in." The Marbleton tailor looked a moment at his oppo- nent in business, then drew his chair closer, ,and said, "Well, the truth is-H-but I don't know whether to tell it or not." "Tell it of course. You can trust me, all the world over. Have no fears, sir," urged Sydney 'Jones, encouragingly, and he looked the personification of secrecy. C"You will not reveal what I may be foolish enough to be persuaded to tell you?" said Jonas, anxiously. "On my soul, no! No, sir! Close as a tomb- faithful until death, and afterwards;" asserted Mr. Jones, solemnly-betraying intense eagerness, to become possessed of Lair's secret, despite his efforts to appear otherwise.     - "Now then, my dear friend, proceed." "I wouldn't tell it to any person, only, that I need a little advice in the matter I have on hand," said   JONAS LAIR'S FORTUNE.      121 Jonas, "As you appear to be well informed-better in fact than anybody about here--and competent to advise, I'll impart it to you. You'll think me very foolish, I know." "No sir--on my soul, no! Nothing foolish about it," interrupted the expectant listener, " pray go on- right through." ( Well," began Jonas, "Three nights ago, I had a dream. v I dreamed that -- but you assure me, you will not betray my secret?" "Dash it!' certainly not. On my soul, sir, I will not. But I fear you'll never give me a chance at this rate"-and Mr. Jones attempted a very weak smile. "You're too cautious to be caught easy: Ha, ha H proceed now, if you please." "I dreamed," resumed the narrator, ', that a box is buried under a blasted poplar tree; not far out of the village. It contains jewels and gold, to a fabulous amount. The night following, and last night the dream was before me again-making three nights in succession.  Stranger yet, to day, after dinner, I fell asleep over my board-and sir, I dreamed it again! What do you think of it?"  The Eagleton tailor had tried hard not to manifest any undue interest in the story; but every feature  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC8357-00000064"/> 122     JONAS LAIR'S FORTUNE. told on him! He was evidently deeply affected; but he managed to recover his calmness, and answered: "I think it strange, sir; very singular. I believe in dreams,*Mrr. Lair! I have known several of this nature to be true. You will find the box and be rich. That is; if you will only-go about securing it, in the proper way. Every thing depends upbn that. Were you informed anything more about it?" : "Nothing more, than what I have told you. But can't you tell me something about how to proceed! There will certainly be sufficient for two, and I pro- posethat you join with me in procuring the treasure. This is the reason I have let you into the-affair at all. I am a little timid, about meddling with such things. You are not so-so far as I can see. You appear to not fear anybody nor anything. What say you?" "My dear sir, you are kind, I thank you-I agree, certainly. I am with you, whenever you please. I have a Volume on hidden treasure at the shop. I'll look it up, and find out what is to be done in the pre- sent case. You said under a blasted maple, I think." 'C Poplar." ' Ah, yes I poplar-so you did-near-let me see,; Did you-describe the locality?" "I think not, but I have no objection to be plain with you; as you will not disclose it." ? /..

I can easily point "out the exact spot when there, but I don't know how to describe it now,. However, that matters little; as we will go together. When shall we try it?" "Let me   think. This is Tuesday, I must have a day or two to prepare for it. They say the "Old Boy" always takes care of such treasure, and we must perform certain 'ceremonies to pacify him'- you know."  "Very well! Appoint your own time. Any night will suit me."  Say Saturday, then. There is less danger of being seen, as fewer persons are out on the Eagleton road, which runs near there." "Very good." "I may not get down to see you until then. I  am pushed with work for the fair. I'll try and see you on Friday, and will then tell you all about the way to manage it." A   few words more, and -Sydney Jones took his departure. The tailor resumed his task, and stitched away more lively than ever before-seemingly very happy, no  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC8357-00000065"/> i24     JONAS. LAIR'S FORTUNE. doubt, in anticipation of his 'great fortune. Then he fell to thinking again, and once or twice spoke out his thoughts. "She will be Mrs. Sydney Jones, will she? I doubt that. A pretty specimen of conceit you are, my fine fellow! She may not marry me, but she will never marry you, Mr. Sydney Jones!" and the words seemed to make the poor tailor very joyous, so that he laughed and sung right merrily. In the- meantime,- the object of -his merriment wended his way to his shop, and having closed it, sat down and had a hearty fit of laughter. Presently he arose, and changed his' diess, putting on a farmer's suit, and disguising his face with false whiskers. A cap, pulled low over his eyes, completed his costume. Thus attired, he sat before the stove for more than two hours. When the little clock in the next room struck ten, he arose, opened the front door, and looked out. Everything was still and lone in the street. The moon was shining in a clouded sky, and the air was quite cold. After a careful survey of the neighbor- hood, he slipped quietly out, and stole down the street, and through the village, out into the open country. At the gate of an isolated farm-shed, he espied, and took possession of a spade, which he carried by his side, until he arrived at Wilber's Hollow. Here he sat down on a fallen tree, and threw the spade on the   JONAS LAIR'S FORTUNE.      125 ground. He looked. nervously about the place, and peered fearfully through the gloomy trees and thick bushes, and seemed debating within himself whether to go further on or retrace his steps. -Ie was evidently a coward. Presently he rallied his courage, took up his spade, and moved into the hollow. The under- growth of dwarf-trees and interlacing shrubbery greatly impeded his progress, but he seemed determined not to pause again; and after much hard work, he came within sight of the blasted poplar tree, underneath whose spreading roots the coveted treasure was to be found. It stood upon a little hillock, grim and spectre- like, in the trembling moonlight. He was very much excited, and for half an hour remained within the friendly covert of the surrounding trees, lacking heart to begin his work.  He had come for the treasure, to- take it all for himself. The exact spot was unknown to him, so that he would be obliged to dig at random. Trembling in every limb- he took up his spade, and made a stroke.  As the edge of the instrument struck the ground, a  startled night-bird gave a screech, and fluttered over his head, terrifying him so that he i dropped his spade with a shriek. But silence reigned again, and he gradually collected his scattered senses and strength, and nothing more interrupting, he dug vigorously until his spade struck something which gave back a   dead sound, like wood. His strained 1 1*     v  ,  - e  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC8357-00000066"/> JONAS LAIR'S FORTUNE.  ears caught it in an instant. IIe had found the spot. With renewed vigor he soon uncovered the top of a dark box, about eighteen inches square. Digging carefully around it, he speedily lifted it from the hole, and stopped an instant to rest. Whilst in this position, he was alarmed at hearing the sound of somebody coming towards him, through the bushes, from the direction of the Eagleton turnpike, which was only a hundred yards distant. He sprang up, and seized the box, to throw it back into the hole, intending to cover everything with brushwood-there were plenty of fallen limbs lying about-and hide himself, but he was too late. Before he had half con- cealed the place, several figures sprang into the clear- ing, and in an instant he found himself fast in the clutches of Doctor Pillston and two stout hired men. "Well, my gay rascal, what have you done ?" asked the doctor in a stern tone. "A murder, I dare say. Speak " shouted the man of physic. "But the senses of the treasure-seeker were scared entirely away, and he could only mumble incoherent words, until the doctor directed his men to search the premises, when he recovered his speech, and essayed to explain. "It is nothing-only a trick, Sir !-a little plot I was arranging for a friend of mine." "Now, my worthyplotter !" exclaimed the Doctor,   JONAS LAIR'S FORTUNE. JONAS LAIR S FORTUNE.   127   solemnly,-" don't add a string of lies to your other wickedness. Did not we hear a scream from this direction a short time ago! Eh ! Dodson ?" "Most certainly !" answered Dodson. "No mistake about that;" corroborated the other individual. "I heard it, plain as day." "Tie him! gentlemen," said the Doctor, with em- phasis--" and continue the search." The prisoner seeing the turn of things, and believing that he was not recognized, thought it best to attempt an escape. The treasure would be found, and be lost to him, anyhow; and besides it might attach more sus- picion to his errand there at such an hour. No sooner thought of than tried. As Dodson brought a rope, the other man and the Doctor held each an arm. Sum- moning all his strength, he gave the unthinking Dod- son a stunning kick in the stomach, which sent the unfortunate man doubled up to the ground. As he expected, the Doctor forgot himself, loosed his grasp, and sprang to the fallen man's assistance. At that instant, he dealt the other man a heavy blow in the face; but the man was staunch. Although the force of the stroke made him stagger and blink, he held his prisoner, and the next moment jumped on him and suc- ceeded in bearing him to the ground: where, with the Doctor's aid, he was securely bound, despite his strug-   I &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC8357-00000067"/> 128     JONAS LAIR'S FORTUNE. gles. He kicked the Doctor in the jaw and arms, and bit the hand of the assistant, and showed- himself to be possessed of uncommon activity. "My stars I exclaimed the ill-used Doctor, as soon as he recovered his breath. He's a very tuugh customer-very: and he felt his sore jaw, as though he was inclined to think it a miracle it was not bro- ken. Dodson soon recovered sufficiently to walk to a log and sit down. The Doctor and his friend began an investigation. Several questions were put to the pri- soner, but he maintained a strict silence. The box was once more lifted out and opened. At the sight revealed, the worthy Doctor recoiled in hor- ror, and looked aghast at the spell-bound prisoner. The box contained a suit of clothes and a shirt, dab- bled with blood. As the articles were taken out of the box and held up to view, the prisoner groaned; shut his eyes and hid his face in his hands. He seemed to be deeply affected. At the bottom of the box were found a short, heavy cudgel, and a broken-bladed butcher knife, both stained with blood. "Oh? bad cruel man!" exclaimed the doctor, feel- ingly: "Whatever induced you to such a crime? Where is your victim? You had better make a clean   JONAS LAIR'S FORTUNE.      129 breast of the whole matter. Secrecy cannot avail you anything. Where is the body?" "There is no body;" answered the stricken man, sorrowfully. Sydney Jones was in a very bad situation, and he knew it. He was suspicioned of being -a mur- derer, and many a man had been hung on far less circumstantial evidence than that there produced against him. Inwardly, he bewailed his fate,) and cursed the hour he came to Marbleton. When he reflected upon the chain of circumstances, the hour, the place, the scream, the box and its horrible con- tents, his -foolish resistance, the :known and highly respected character of his captop, his being a compara- tive stranger in Marbleton; every thing was so much against him, that he could almost foresee the con- clusion of the whole matter; and he groaned in the spirit and wished himself dead. He saw there would be no use in attempting to exculpate himself, there; and besides he was so much confused and excited that he did not know what to say. Fearful of further crimi- nating himself by some crazy speeches, he determined to be silent, until a more fitting time. The doctor continued to give his friends directions, and ask the prisoner questions; not one of which was honored with an answer,  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC8357-00000068"/> 130      JONAS LAIR'S FORTUNE. At last he grew somewhat irritated at the silence, and exclaimed sharply: "Well, well, Sir! Be obstinate if you will. I'll have the hollow searched at day-light, for the body." "And the creek ;" suggested Dodson. "Of course!" said the Doctor; "Every place likeTy to afford&amp; a shield to the deeper evidence of this hardened wretch's villainy." It was within two hours of daybreak. A wagon was procured, and the prisoner and box were placed in it, and driven to a temporary prison in the lower part of the village.  Here he was searched, and his disguise removed. Before them stood Sydney Jones, the fashionable tailor, very chop-fallen. Astonishment appeared upon the faces of all present, and the doctor, stepping back, exclaimed: "You, Sir! Is it possible? Dear, oh dear! Who would have thought, you would do murder!" The others said: "Oh, horrible, horrible!" and appeared shocked, beyond power of expression. Unfortunate Jones, overcome by conflicting emo- tions, too strong to be longer mastered, he gave forth a groan, and fell back, insensible. When day opened fairly, Marbleton was soon in a terrible state of feeling. "A murder has been com- mitted!" said one to the other: "Did you hear of it?'"   JONAS LAIR'S FORTUNE.     , 131 And then the oft repeated story was told again with added particulars; until the narrator and hearer, alike, were worked into an intense feeling against the arrested murderer. "And, who do you suppose the man is?" would be the conclusion of the bloody narrative. "Sydney Jones-the new tailor." And then, there were sun- dry head-shakings and many wise remarks of, "I never liked him : He always had a bad look out of his eyes. I expected you would name him ;" and other equally charitable expressions. Judging by the tenor of the gossip in Marbleton, everybody had, all along, suspected the 'fashionable tailor' to be a scoundrel,. and "' A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd, Quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame." Jonas Lair opened his shop window at the usual hour, and stood before the door, quaffing rich draughts of of health from the bracing morning air. He saw there was an unusual stir in the village. The villagers were gathered here and there, in groups of three and more, in animated discussion. Presently the  tailor was espied, and several of the talker's came over to him. "Good morning, neighbor Jonas! Have you heard the news?" "News!   what news?"  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC8357-00000069"/> 132     JONAS LAIR'S FORTUNE. And then the story was recounted for his benefit; during the recital of which, the tailor expressed a due amount of astonishment and horror. He seemed some- what ashamed, too, that the criminal should be a fel- low craftsman, As the morning advanced, word was brought to the village; that the daughter of a neighboring farmer was missing. Immediately, everybody believed that Sydney Jones had killed her. Threats were made of lynching him. The jailor communicated the interest- ing news to his prisoner, who at once considered him- self a doomed man. He had no heart to think of a defence. What could he offer in refutation of the charge? Who would believe him? He was in great agony. In the midst of his grief, the officers of the law entered the room and escorted him to a convey- ance, which was then started for Eagleton, where he would be examined. About four miles out, the road crossed the upper extremity of Wilber's hollow. As the party were passing some large bushes, three men sprang from behind them and stopped the horse. One of- the constables drew his pistol and pulled the trigger; but the weapon only exploded the cap. The men in the road laughed and ordered the officers out of the wagon. The angry owner of the unfaithful pistol, tried another, with no more fatal effect. .      .           .   JoNAS LAIR'S FORTUNE.     133 By this time the men had unharnessed the horse and whilst one of them led him away, the others drew pistols, and threatened to scatter the brains of the constables to the four winds, unless they released their prisoner. Such persuasion was too much for the officers, and they hastened and set Sydney Jones free. One of his rescuers took him aside and said, in a low tone, "Escape now,--away!" The delighted tailor lost no time in obeying the injunction. Plunging into the woods, he was soon beyond hear- ing. He was never heard of again, in those parts. There was trouble in Marbleton when the officers returned and told their storys. The men who had rescued the prisoner had started the horse homeward, and the sagacious animal had trotted back to his stable. Then the officers were permitted to depart, with an injunction not to attempt the re-capture of their man unless they wished to have holes put through their heads. So the murderer escaped. Jonas Lair said very little about the matter; but not many evenings after the occurrences just narrated the doctor, the squire, and the tailor were in the latter's shop, talking in whispers, and laughing, as if enjoying an excellent joke. "I never saw a man so frightened," said the doctor, 12  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC8357-00000070"/> 34     JONAS LAIR'S FORTUNE.           lbbing his hands together; "He'll never go again after ensure hidden in the woods, I'll venture to assert." "s You managed it well," said the squire, chuckling; Now then, Jonas! you'll have a clear track in love nd trade. I wish you good luck!" "It's all right now, I think!" answered Jonas He'll not visit:-Marbleton again." "I just got there in the nick of time," said the loctor; "to catch him with the box. You had a good assortment in it, Lair, but Mr. Jones did not apple-. ciate your taste-ha ha!"' Thereupon they all laughed, and had a jolly time, generally. When the trio separated at a late hour, they said, , We'll keep it a secret 1" and so they did. The good people of Marbleton have not yet learned what tran- spired in the tailor's shop. The place of Sydney Jones remained as he left it, until word was sent to Eagleton. Then a man came, andclaimed the goods, and removed them. Thus Marbleton resumed its wonted quiet, and Jonas was again without a rival. But he found a fortune for all that. In a few months after the involuntary departure of Sydney Jones from the village, Jonas won the heart of Miss Hetty Somers,--his first love, and that was fortune enough for him.  IT was a very cold, bleak morning, just at th6 grey of dawn, that I took my seat in the old stage-coach for Bankville, to continue my homeward journey. The distance, I had been informed, was about fifty miles; and, as it was not expected we would arrive at our terminus until nightfall, I settled as comfortably 'as possible into my alloted space,--drew my heavy cloak more closely about me, and prepared for-a dull day. The coach accommodated five persons besides myself, and every seat was occupied; having been previously secured. The country through which we passed, presented nothing unusual in appearance to invite attention, and my companions being rather taciturn, I was becoming drowsy at the end of the first hour on the road, when the coach stopped, and I heard the driver exclaim,--"All full, my good woman!" Rousing myself, I looked out and beheld a young woman, holding a child by the hand; both very blue in the cold air. She seemed very anxious to pursue her projected journey, and gazed so wistfully into the snug coach that I offered to give her my seat; apd without more fords dismounted-handed her, into it  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC8357-00000071"/> 136       IN THE SNOW. and accepted a position with the driver. Once again under way, I was relapsing into silenae, when my new companion said pleasantly, "Cold comfort up here, sir?" "Yes; rather!"I answered, turning to look at the speaker. The driver was an old man, with face bronzed by exposure to all weathers. He was habited roughly, but had a cheery, pleasant voice, and a kindly expression of countenance, that speedily made me feel interested in him. He handled the reins, too; and directed his four noble horses with consummate skill, showing long practice and much patience. "I have felt colder days than this, sir!" he re- marked; "Ah, yes! This is no circumstance to some I have experienced. I have driven on this and other roads, for some thirty years, and in all kinds of weather; some very-very rough." "You have seen some pretty heavy snows, I pr'e- sume?" said I. "You say right!" resumed the old man, fixing his eyes upon some object in the distance, to the right of us. "Do you see that break in the mountain, Just in sight?"       '  "Quite plainly sir!"  ' I Our way leads through that gorge, after winding somewhat, to take in several post villages.

"Indeed!" said I, inviting him by my tone, to con- tinue the conversation. "Yes sir! and if you desire it, I will relate to you the circumstance; although there is a sad story con- nected with it." I thanked him, and begged he would proceed. Grasping the lines with a firmer hand, the old man commenced :--"It was, I believe, about fifteen years ago, in mid-winter; I started from Markes, then a small village, with three passengers-a gentlemen and his wife and child,-a lovely and interesting boy. The morning was such as this, only not so cold; for the light clouds which flitted across the sky did not prevent the sun from giving us some warmth. The lady was quite young, and rather beautiful; but a shade of sadness ever rested upon her face, bespeaking some hidden sorrow. Her husband was very kind to her, and laughed loudly at the pranks of his boy as we drove along; but at times was silent and rather grum. I noticed his face was somewhat bloated, and concluded he was addicted to drinking too much strong liquor. The stage of those days was merely a covered wagon, with seats for six, and a place behind for the baggage- much was not taken. The driver occupied part of the 12* ' -          A "\  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC8357-00000072"/> IN THE SNO W. seat in front, and could see and converse with those within. An hour after starting, the sky was rapidly overcast with those dull, heavy, leaden-looking clouds; sure to bring snow. Soon after it began falling-very slowly for a little while, and the winds began to whistle about our ears. The air grew colder as we proceeded, and we were obliged to muffle warmly. The snow was very light, and seemed a long time whitening the ground. Indeed, we had reached the Relay House, about half way where we changed horses, before it was an inch deep. Here was a comfortable inn, and the lady proposed remaining until the next day, until the storm was over. But her husband persisted in continuing the journey- remarking there would be no difficulty in getting through the twenty-seven miles yet before us, and laughed at her fears. He asked me if I did not intend going all the way; and on my telling him I did, (for I had the mail, and was bound to try it at least,) he persuaded his wife to continue on the road. After our usual stop we took our seats again, and were soon on-our way. I had two strong, noble horses; neat limbed and spirited, and we dashed along gallantly for a few miles. The storm increased greatly, and the snow fell thicker and faster, whilst the mountain air n            '-   IN THE SNOW.   blew keen and cutting. At the Relay House I had observed the lady strove to keep near her husband all the time, as if fearing some evil would happen him. But he had managed to slip away several times for a few moments, and twice I saw him at the bar of the inn, with a glass in his hand. Again, just as we started-after lifting his (boy in to her, he stepped back and procured another drink. Whilst at the Relay House, I had no fears of having much trouble to drive to Bankville-on the other side of the gorge. Having only driven on the road one winter-a mild one, I had never been caught on the mountain, in a snow storm. We pushed on as rapidly as possible,-the way becoming more difficult at every mile traveled, on account of the heavy fall of snow, which was drifting before the north-east wind, that whirled it into my face. I had some hours before-this, lowered and secured the front curtain, or partition of thick, double leather; thus shutting my passengers in and making them more comfortable. Sometimes the eastern side of the road was quite bare of snow, and then I touched up my team and gained a little for the next struggle. ' At sunset we entered the mountain-road, leading up the western side of the severed chain. Snow had been falling for six hours, and half that time very heavily.  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC8357-00000073"/> "O       IN THE SNOW. The wind had blown it about, and drifted the narrow pass about a foot and a half deep all over. The horses labored stoutly up the grade, and I began to see I would have trouble if not very careful. Springing- from my snowy seat, I took the off-horse by the head, and urged them on. The sky was almost hidden by the blinding flakes, and -the fierce winds seemed to gain strength with every gust, until they fairly shrieked like wailing demons in despair; and in their madness almost overset the stage. But even then I did not fear, believing I could cross the mountain before the snow was deep enough, to prevernt; and knowing that once accomplished, a half hour would bring us to Bankville. I frequently stepped to the coach-window to reassure my passengers; and whilst I always found the lady in distress of mind, I never received a word from her husband. He was leaning back in a corner in silence. We at length gained the summit, after strenuous toil, and were descending in better time, when unlucky fate, a large tree was blown 'down right across the track, bringing us to an- instant halt. Here was a situation. I was alone, so far as human help was concerned, on the rugged -slope, the snow drifting deeper every moment, the winds strong enough to have swept us, stage, horses, and all, down the chasm on our right, had we not been fast in the snow,   IN THE SNOW.        141 a large tree blocking the narrow road, and night com- ing on. I was in my prime then, and not easily daunted; but I assure you I felt uneasy." I here ventured to interrupt him, and asked '" where was the gentleman all that time?" "Drunk, sir; lying in the stage, unconscious. I was for a moment inclined to be angry with him, but that feeling soon gave place to one of -pity for his wife and child. Seizing my axe-I always carried one-which, was keen of edge, I prepared for work. I handed the lady the stage-lamps to light, which done, I told her to keep one, and hung the other in its place. Soon my axe was ringing merrily upon the impeding trunk, and the chips strewed the white surface of the crispy snow, I did not attempt to clear a passage for the coach, as it was now immovable in' the snow-drift. I merely cut a piece from the trunk large enough to permit a horse to pass. That done after two hours hard-work, I had the pleasure to see the severed sec- tions sink into the snow, leaving room to pass, if attempted at once. I then informed the lady of my success, and explained that our only chance of -escape was to mount the horses, and endeavor to reach Bank- ville. She hesitated when she saw her husband would have to be left awhile. But I persuaded her it -was impossible to take all at once, especially one in such a helpless condition. I assured her I would return as  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC8357-00000074"/> "2       IN THE SNOW. soon as she was in safety, and rescue him. She saw the sense of my reasoning, and consented to go with me. I seated her upon one of the horses, with her sleeping child in her arms., Taking the large buffalo- robe from my seat, I threw it over her husband, and piled the cushions around him. Leaving the well-filled lantern hanging to the back seat, I descended, and closed-the door tightly. - Mounting the other horse- to whose neck I had fastened the other lantern-and taking his mate's bridle, we started down the moun- tain. The wind had lulled somewhat, and by keeping near the edge of the road, we succeeded in breaking a way to Bankville. There I aroused the inn-keeper, left my passengers, and in company with two men, mounted fresh horses, and returned to the mountain. The wind had changed in the interim, and was blow- ing almost a hurricane from the northwest. But little snow was falling, and that on the groundt was being drifted in huge piles on the eastern side of the way, leaving the other side quite free. Once on the sum- mit, I looked in vain for any sign of the light I had left. As the beams from our lanterns lit up the spot, I saw the coach was over on its side. - The snow in drifting away from it, had, left it at the mercy- of the winds, which had blown it over in the manner we found it. Another instant, and I had the door open, and by the aid of my lantern saw the gentleman was doubled   IN THE SNOW.       143 up on the floor-dead. A livid mark upon his temple indicated the cause. When the stage had overturned, he had been thrown violently, head first, against an iron brace, securing the -front seat, and no doubt instantly killed. Righting the stage, we attached the horses, and reached Bankville without much difficulty. The agony of that young wife and mother was painful to behold. I was obliged to return the next morning, and did not see her again; but they told me she took her husband's remains with her to the North.'" The old man did not speak again during our ride, except to point out the place when we were passing- through the gorge. ,'  -  /  f!  &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC8357-00000075"/> IN a certain year of the olden time, before the days of steam and telegraphs, and shrewd detectives, Tum- bletown was incorporated, and honored and protected by the instalments in office of Able Winkie, as Bur- gess, and Amos Podgers and Perter Badger, as-Con- stables. Able Winkie was a stringent lover of law and order, and manfully determined -to have peace and quiet preserved in Tumbletown, at all hazards, and at every sacrifice of his own comfort, as he declared in his eloquent speech, upon the momentous occasion. Now, as Tumbletown was a very staid,.in fact, rather a sleepy sort of a town, with only an occasional small election squabble, it may have been deemed foolish and unnecessary in Mr. Winkie to make such asser- tions; but he considered himself bound to say some- thing, and not being a man of notable erudition, he could think of nothing better. The Burgess was at once filled with an excessive amount of self-importance. It is said of him, that when about retiring at night, after the eventful day, he paused, in the necessary act of removing his coat, and looking sternly at Mrs. Winkie; said, with exceed-   THE BURGESS OF TUMBLETOWN.    145 ing great solemnity: (' You see before you-not Mr. Winkie, Ma'am, but the Burgess of Tumbletown." What effect this imposing speech, celebrated for brevity, had upon Mrs. Winkie, our informant did not say ; but doubtless she w*as overwhelmed with a sense of the great change, and could make no comment. Mr. Winkie was a short gentleman, not too stout, with a large bald place on his head, and a smooth chin. He was but little versed in legal lore, and depended upon being able to glean sufficient knowledge from sundry old law books, should he ever find himself in a tight place. He had a very exalted opinion of his own merits and- abilities, and believed himself to be of so much consequence to Tumbletown, that, should he be untimely called upon to pay the great debt of nature, Tumbleton would go to decay, and eventually be no longer known.        ' He always carried a  large-headed stick-mostly under his arm, and walked along with a dignity befit" ing his high position. Every one in the town held his worship in great respect. Hats were doffed and heads bowed wherever he walked. Mr. Podgers, high constable, stood very much in the light of a shadow, to Mr. Winkie. Whatever the latter said or did, the high constable fully endorsed. He would have considered it rank treason to entertain 13 !  &#xD;<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC8357-00000076"/> 1 46   THE BURGESS OF TUMBLETOWN. for a single moment a contrary opinion. Mr. Pod- gers had from the beginning; in truth, even before his election-of which he had had no doubt at all-resolved to be a faithful and efficient officer, and so he was. Mr. Badger, on the contrary, was not so careful to sustain the dignity of his calling, and to keep his honor unsullied and above suspicion. Some things were said of Constable Badger, by-no mea;s complimentary to his fidelity to the laws, and Burgess Winkie. But he, was a clever, good-hearted soul, and a great favorite with the children; and consequently was in high repute with the matrons. As the matrons, for the most part ruled their husbands; the malicious whis- perings of the few were treated with silent contempt by the many, and so Mr. Badger continued to repre- sent a guardian of the peace. One chilly, rainy evening, in the fall of the year, a little group was gathered in the bar-room of the "Crow and Eagle," engaged in friendly conversation. Martin Grigg, the bustling landlord, was busy behind his bar, mixing sundry glasses of odorous punch for his thirsty visitors, who had disposed themselves in comfortable positions, about the great stove in the centre of the room.. Prominent amongst the loungers was Constable Badger, sitting with his face to the back of his chair, upon which he rested one arm; whilst the other held an empty glass, from which some epleasant * ,    THE BURGESS OF TUMBLETOWN.     147 beverage had evidently just escaped down his throat. He was occupied regarding the!empty vessel with loving and regretful looks and, no doubt, considering the propriety of repeating the dose. Next to Consta- ble Badger, leaning back in a one-armed chair, was Dill Beam, the sexton. He was asleep, or pretended to be, with both hands in his pockets, and his feet rest- ing on the edge of the wooden box filled with sand, which surrounded the stove. Three other worthies- Sol Snaggs, the-tailor; Jim Jobbs, the joiner, and Phil White, the cobbler, assisted in completing the- interesting circle. The tailor was noted in Tumble- town for - two things; making very bad fits, or no fits at all; and for having an excessive share of curiosity. Nothing could transpire in the place, or for miles around, but Sol Snaggs could tell more about it, and hours sooner than any other individual. He was never averse to leaving his shop at any hour of the day, to gossip with a neighbor; and the luckless wight, who needed his clothes made in a hurry, might rave and scold to his heart's content, without inciting the lazy tailor to industry.          . " Having mixed the liquors for his customers, Mr. Grigg came from behin'd his bar, and stood with his back against it; prepared-to talk or listen, as circum- stances might require.  He was a pleasant, medita- tive, easy man; not stout, nor lean, nor short, nor   &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC8357-00000077"/> "8   THE BURGESS OF TUMBLETOWN. tall; but a happy medium between them all. To all appearances he lived well, kept a clear ,oonsienee, and enjoyed good health. "An inclement night, constable!" said Mr. Grigg. "I should think as much;' replied the worthy constable. "A bad night to be on the road." "Something like the night Squire Glenn was mur- dered at the stunted buttonwood, ten years ago," remarked Dill Beam, whose memory was- excellent in such matters. "You remember that, Mr, Grigg." "Ayei! I do that Dill. Theybrought him in here; the worthy old man, when he was breathing his last." "The murderer was never found out," said Mr. Badger, musingly. "More's the pity," said the landlord, "He de- serves a short rope, if he is yet unhung, which I doubt." "Well!" began Sol Snaggs; when I'-- Here the sound of a horse's feet gave evidence of a new-comer, and Mr. Grigg hurried to the door. In a few moments he returned in company with a very wet,  muddy traveler.  The traveler bowed to the company, and walked to the bar, where he tossed off a stiff glass of raw brandy, and gave directions about his beast. Then he ad.   THE BURGESS OF TUMBLETOWN,'    149   - vanced to the circle about the stove, and accepted the chair Constable Badger vacated, that gentleman pre- ferring to walk awhile from the bar to the east window. "Have you rode far to-night?" inquired Mr. Grigg. "About twenty miles since sundown, or the time the sun goes down--for not an inch of sun did I see to-day," answered the man. "The mud for the last five miles, was above the fetlocks of my horse. Hard traveling, I assure you." "Not a bit of doubt about that," returned the land- lord. There was silence for a few moments, which was broken by the traveler saying in a low tone: "What a horrid murder that was." The company started very perceptibly, and the con- stable stopped his monotonous tramp behind the man's chair, all attention, whilst landlord Grigg leaned for- ward, his eyes considerably dilated. "A murder!" echoed Phil White, with blanched cheek.  "Then you've none of you heard of it?" said the traveler quietly. "No," said all of them under their breaths. "Tell- us about it," urged Mr. Grigg. Thus adjured, the traveler told them of how a wealthy and retired merchant, living in Clayton--dis- 13*    -   &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC8357-00000078"/> 150    THE BURGESS OF TUMBLETOWN. tant from Tumbletown forty miles--had been brutally murdered the previous night. The murderer had been arrested, but had escaped through some mismanage- ment on the part of his!aptors. He was still eluding the officers of justice, having gone nobody could sur- mise where. It was not thought he had taken the road to Tumbletown. "But he may do so yet," added the stranger. "Bless me!" ejaculated Mr. Grigg, aghast at the bare idea of a real, live murderer coming to Tumble- town, and perchance stopping at the Crow and Eagle for a drink, to keep up his courage. "He might come here-  dozen times," remarked Dill Beam. "How should anybody know him from an honest man-?" "Bah!" sneered the constable. "I -could tell a murderer in a minute, as soon as I set my eyes oh him. No disguise could cheat me, I tell you; I'd find him out-trust me for that. A man of experience and discernment oan read the iountenance. I can do it," and the worthy Badger looked very hard at the trav- eler, as if the time had already come to display his superior powers.- But the traveler returned his gaze with such good interest, that Mr. Badger was some- what abashed, and withdrew his eyes in much haste. "Well!" spoke up Sol Snaggs, "some of them chaps as' commits murder, and does big stealing, air   THE BURGESS OF TUMBLETOWN.    151 pretty cute, now, I've been told; and once they're off, they ain't easy caught again." "Maybe they are, and maybe they are'nt," ans. wered the constable, tapping his forehead knowingly. "Well," added the stranger; "I'll tell you how he Was described to me. A youngish sort of a man, with dark whiskers all round his face, and curly hair. He was dressed in a black suit, out and out, when last seen; but he'll change it, of course, as soon as he can. He is about five feet ten, and not heavy built. Very gentlemanly and easy in his manners. That's all I know about it or him. But you've enough to help you, should he chance this way. I hope you'll catch him." With that he got up, and ordered another brandy, which having drank, he desired a light to go to bed. Mr. Grigg stepped to the door at the side of the bar, and called into the dark passage, "Snacks!" After repeating the call six times, each time pitching his voice higher, Master Snacks appeared, creeping along with an unlit candle. "Light it!" commanded the landlord. "What do ' you bring it in that way for?" Master Snacks evidently had not the remotest idea  why he had brought it in that condition, so he wisely held his peace, and gaped in Mr. Grigg's face, instead of an answer. ,'  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC8357-00000079"/>   152    THE BURGESS OF TUMBLETOWN. "Did I ever see such a booby!" exclaimed Phil White contemptuously. He'll never know anything, if he don't soon learn something;" and with this sage and brief remark, Phil White turned to Dill Balm. "Certainly not!" said the latter, in confirmulation. "He's a bright lark-very." Meanwhile the 'bright lark" was endeavoring to light his candle at the tall one on the bar; but with little hope of success, as the wick was thoroughly saturated with tallow, and he did not hold it steady long enough. "Break it, will you!" cried Mr. Grigg, provoked at the " lark's " stupidity. What was the astonishment of the spectators to see Master Snacks deliberately take the candle from the candle-stick, and break it in half, at the same time staring the traveler out of countenance. 'Now, what a fool!" exclaimed Constable Badger. Landlord Grigg could say nothing for a few seconds, from sheer surprise. But he presently recovered him- self, and darting forward, seized the candle-stick in one hand, and with the other dealt the boy a blow on the ear, which set him to howling in a most hideous style. "Get out of my sight, you--y--y--ou stupid dolt," he commanded, "and stop that noise, or I'll horse- whip you, and cut your tongue off, and--" What further pleasant and desirable acts of kindness   THE BURGESS OF -TUMBLETOWN.    153 the irritated man was about to promise Master Snacks, remained unspoken; for the traveler reminded Mr. Grigg of his desire to be off to bed. So the landlord repaired the damaged candle with newspaper, lit it, and led the way into the entry, followed by his guest, who nodded a good-night to the group at the stove. "What an awful murder!" remarked Phil White, when the retreating footsteps had gone beyond hear- ing. "What do you say, Mr. Badger?" "A remarkable crime, surely," said the constable,! pausing in his walk to flatten his nose against the east window, in a vain attempt to peer out into the road. The storm was raging furiously, and with each wild gust of howling wind, the heavy rain dashed alarm- ingly against the trembling glass in the rattling sash, as though some strong, impatient hand were trying to tear it out. After the constable's answer, no one spoke until the landlord returned. He blew out his light, deposited his candle on the high shelf above the door, behind the bar, and came slowly forward to the stove. "I've an idea that murderer may come along here to-night," he said, seriously. "No! You don't think it! Do you?" quickly, said Snaggs, half rising from his chair. "I've a kind of presentiment.-I don't feel easy.-  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC8357-00000080"/> 154    THE BURGESS OF TUMBLETOWN. Something is going to happen," continued Mr. Grigg, "or I'm an old croaker-mark that!" A kind of awe fell upon the men of Tumbletown, the constable included; although it would not do for him to show it, so he tried to look incredulous, and said, ' Pshaw!" No one took the least notice of such hardihood, on the part of Mr. Badger ; so he said; " fiddle-sticks!" and resumed his walk. "Mr. Badger!" said Mr. Grigg, solemnly, "What do you mean?" "Nothing!" answered the Constable, without paus- ing.. "Well!" asked Dill Beam; " if he comes this way, what 'il you do, landlord?" "Catch him, of course," said Mr. Grigg, bravely. "And eat him?" added Mr. Badger, gravely. The company did not seem to view the subject in the same bantering light, and, the cobbler was about to comment upon the constable's untimely wit, when the old clock gave forth its accustomed premonitory, wh-r-r-r, and struck ten. At the sound of the ever faithful monitor, the land- lord moved to the bar, and commenced closing it, whilst the loungers arose to depart. The Crow and Eagle was never kept open after ten o'clock. Dill Beam took up his lantern, lit the candle, but-   THE BURGESS OF TUMBLETOWN.     155 toned his great coat to the throat, settled his slouched hat over his brows, and stalked out the door, attended by his companions similarly prepared to weather the storm. They stood a moment on the- porch, and then each said: "Good night!" and disappeared in the darkness. Mr. Grigg closed the doors and-windows, adjusted the fire and sat down to collect his ideas. Now, whether from not being able to concentrate them with- out much fatigue, or because of their exceeding dull- ness, when collected, it is difficult to say; but from some cause, his head began to droop forward, and then straightened, suddenly, and fell again, in a man- ner, which threatened to break his neck, if long con- tinued. Presently, he breathed hard, until he snored. He was fast asleep. The candle burned low, and a long, black wick dimmed the light. A current of air made it flicker, and long, queer shadows danced about the room, played on the floor, hid in the corners, hopped on to the benches, ran over the smoke-covered ceil- ing and even over the landlord's face. Still he slept on. There is no telling but he would have continued to slumber until morning, or longer; but just when the last half-inch of candle was melting in its socket, a thundering rap on the door woke him, as an electric shock would have done.  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC8357-00000081"/> 156   THE BURGESS OF TUMBLETOWN, "( God bless me!" he exclaimed, trembling like a leaf, as the knocking was repeated louder than before, and without intermission. He had arisen, and was standing, irresolute, between the stove and the door- his eyes fixed on the latter, as though he expected to see some one walk right through it. A tremendous bang, caused him to move forward, involuntarily. After considerable effort to decide whether to undo it, or not, he opened the door half- way, and hid himself behind it, whilst he sought to catch a glimpse of the party without. But the door was pushed violently open, almost crushing Mr. Grigg against the wall, and a man rushed in, and stood in the middle of the room, and shook himself like a dog. 'Whew!". he exclaimed, for a few moments, not deigning to notice the scared man behind the door. The intruder allowed the rain to run off his oil-skin coat and cap, until little streams crept over the floor, towards/ Mr. Grigg. The man looked down, and his eyes followed one until they rested upon the landlord's feet, and thence traveled up his body, and stopped at his white face. "Well!" said the man, sharply; "Why do you stand there? Come out 1 I'll not eat you." Mr. Grigg came out forthwith, and stared at his ill- timed visitor, like a child at a puppet-show.

"I am the landlord!" said Mr. Grigg, tremulously. "You, eh! I beg your pardon. I should'nt have thought it. Well! Mr. "Grigg," humbly suggested that individual, in a low voice. "t Grigg! is it?

Don't stop to say a word-just hurry along, will you?" Mr. Grigg bowed and vanished into the dark entry, glad of an opportunity to collect his ideas. He hur- ried to the room were Snacks was sleeping. After a deal of thumping Iand pulling, he landed the half- awake lad on the floor. "Get up you lout, or I'll flay you alive!" cried the impatient and excited landlord, making ominous motions with a cart-whip which had hung in the room. Thus threatened, Master Snacks was wide awake in an instant, and had his clothes on in three minutes. His master threw a  great coat over him, and bidding him follow, led the way down  the back stairs, and opened the door looking towards the stables. "Now then," said Mr. Grigg; " run for your life, "  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC8357-00000082"/> 158   THE BURGESS OF TUMBLETOWN. to Burgess Winkies, and tell him there's a murderer here--a desperate fellow. Off now!" and the land- lord pushed Snacks out, and closed the door, leaving it unlocked. Then he slipped up to the traveler's room and wakened him, after considerable trouble. In a con- fused manner, Mr. Grigg managed to inform his guest that the murderer had come and was in the bar-room. "What shall we do?" he asked. "Wait until I am dressed," said the traveler. ( Sit down-or no-perhaps. you had better keep an eye on his movements, until I come. I'll be ready in a few moments." The frightened landlord stole softly down the stairs, and through the entry, and peeped through the key- hole in the bar-room door. The intruder upon Mr. Grigg's quiet, was evidently impatient. 'He was walking rapidly about; but, in another minute stopped at the bar, unbuttoned his vest, and thrusting in his hand, stood as if trying to think seriously, about something important. Then he drew forth a pistol, and examined it with much coolness. Mr. Grigg's teeth chattered, and his blood threatened to stop coursing through his veins. As the man leaned against the bar, with the candle at his side--partly in front, Mr. Grigg could plainly see his shirt bosom. He noticed two spotsof blood on it.   THE BURGESS OF TUMBLETOWN.    159 He was in a quandary. Should he go in, or wait? He concluded to do the latter, and kept his eye to the keyhole, whilst he trembled at every sound. Snacks ran away as fast as the mud would allow, and in a few minutes thundered at Mr. Winkie^s door. Mr.-Winkie was pleasantly dreaming in his cozy bed when the crash of Snacks' heels resounded through the still house. His more wakeful spouse heard the terrible noise first, and pulled her lord's ear to awake him. The Burgess gave a grunt, and turned over. His gentle partner tried it again. "Mr. Winkie-dear!-do get awake!" here she pulled his ear a little harder,-"There's somebody!" ' Bless us--where?" cried his honor, pulling off his night-cap to hear better. "Thieves!" he yelled, as Snacks sent both heels and two half bricks-one in each hand, against the door. "Murder!-fire!--m-m !" "Hush, hush; dear!" said Mrs. Winkie, covering his mouth with her hand; "Get up and look out the window." "Not for the world!" cried the valorous Burgess; "They'll shoot!" "Then I'll do it," said Mrs. Winkie, and she jumped  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC8357-00000083"/> 160    THE BURGESS OP TUMBLETOWN. out of bed and raised the sash before Mr. Winkie could offer a protest. She could not see Snacks, who was on the porch; but that young gentleman hearing the sash raised, leaned out over the railing and shrieked, "Mr. Burgus, Mr. Burgus!" "Snacks is that you?" called Mrs. Winkie, half recognizing the voice. "Yes'm; where Mr. Burgus? He must come right away to the Crow and Eagle. There's a murdrer there, and Master Grigg sent me to tell him to come right away." "What's that Snacks? What's that-a murderer?" shouted the Burgess, who, finding his wife was not injured, had bravely crept to the window and was peeping over her shoulder. ' A murdrer;- that's all I know," answered Snacks. "Dear me!" exclaimed Mr. Winkie; " where did you say?" "At our house, sir!" "A murderer at the Crow and Eagle! Heaven keep them all. They'll be killed in their beds.- Dreadful! horrible! Mrs. Winkie, ma'am, make a light. Snacks!" ' Sir!" "I'll come at once," and he shut the window and   THE BURGESS OF TUMBLETOWN.    161 dropped the curtain, whilst Mrs. Winklie lit the candle. Mr. Winkie hastily dressed,-so fast, indeed, that he put on his waistcoat inside out, and broke his sus- penders jerking his trousers from the peg. Then embracing his wife very affectionately, he said, with a touch of feeling, mingled with dignity, "Mrs. Winkie, ma'am! Murderers have been known to take life! This man is doubtless a hardened villain;--a very desperate fellow. He may kill somebody, and possibly that somebody may be me. But I go without a fear, and if I should not come back alive, you will bear witness to the sacrifice I shall make, for the good and safety of my fellow men." "Oh, Mr. Winkie!" sobbed his estimable lady, letting fall two drops of hot tallow upon her noble husband's neck; "Must you really go?" "Madam!" spoke out the Burgess; "You forget yourself;--there now. Not a word more. I must run.-Don't keep hold of me." But although Mrs. Winkie did not have hold of him at air, and made no effort to detain him, Mr. Winkie did not seem in such great haste. He was about speaking again when his gentle partner said, amidst her tears, -"Oh, those poor men! What a horrible thing to be killed in your sleep." "Dear oh,-yes! What am I about?

I stopped so long? said Mr. Winkie, pausing with his hand on the latch of the half-opened door, as if await- ing an answer from some one in the entry. No person responding, however, to inform him; he looked at Mrs. Winkie, then at the window, and finally walked: cautiously out of the room, his good lady lighting him down the stairs. At the foot he paused again, and seemed inclined to make another speech, but his wife said, ("Those poor people will-" " ou're right! so they will, before I can get there to arrest the assassin's arm," said the Burgess, and he seemed overwhelmed with the tremendous responsi- bility resting upon him. But he soon recovered, and rushed towards the street-door. Here he stopped short,- "Mrs. Winkie, ma'am!" "Well, dear!" "I am going!" '"Yes, love!" "Don't wait up for me!" "No dear!" "I'll not expose myself unnecessarily, therefore I may be spared to return. I do hope nothing 'will transpire to injure me, for your sake!

"Well, love?" "Good bye!" "Good bye, dear!" Mr. Winkie opened the door again, and fell back with a cry, at the same time banging the door shut and locking it. Mrs. Winkie alarmed, came to the top step with-the candle. ( What's the matter, dear?" "A man," whispered the Burgess, pointing signifi- cantly to the door. Mrs. Winkie screamed, and dropped the light, which went out, leaving them in utter darkness. "God help us!" ejaculated Mr. Winkie under his breath. There was a loud knocking at the door, and a voice called for Mr. Winkie. "That voice!" cried the latter worthy, in a delighted tone. "Podgers!" -and he hastened and  opened the door. . Sure enough; Podgers stood there with a lantern he had just succeeded in lighting for the second time.

Podgers came up the steps, and Mrs. Winkie came down, and her candle was found and re-lighted, and then the Burgess and the high constable went out together into the stormy night, and made for the Crow and Eagle. Snacks dreaming it important to have sufficient force had stopped at Constable Podgers on his way home, and rapped him out. And Mr. Podgers could not think of permitting his honor to go without an escort, and so had hurried to meet him. They found the tramp anything but agreeable. The bold elements had no respect for the Burgess. The boisterous winds cut his face. The pouring rain soaked hiss clothing, despite his great coat and umbrella; and the mud held him back in its tough embrace. For some rods the executives of Tumbletown held their way in silence. "Mr. Podgers," at length called Mr. Winkie. "Sir, your honor." "It is terrible." "It is, indeed, sir," answered Podgers, not exactly understanding to what his honor alluded. He might have meant the bad weather or the unpleasantness of having to leave his couch at that time of night; or he   THE BURGESS OF TUMBLETOWN.    165 might have been thinking of the condition of affairs at the Crow and Eagle. "Mr. Podgers," continued his honor; "I depend entirely upon you in this trying hour. You are my stay, sir! Don't fail me!" "I will not, sir," answered the high constable, solemnly. They were!nearing the Crow and Eagle, when Mr. Winkie was nearly overcome with terror at the sudden appearance of a figure, which sprang up before him. There is no telling what might have been the result of the fright, had not Podgers turned his light upon the form of Snacks, who looked badly scared, too. "You young wagabone," said the high constable, giving Snacks a blow under the ear. "What are you here for?" "To show you the door," whimpered Snacks. "Master sent me." "Oh, he did, did he?" said Podgers. "Very good then; lead on." Snacks led them to the back entrance. The door was unlatched. "Stop!" whispered Mr. Winkie.  "Mr. Podgers!" "Your honor, sir." "You had better go in first, and examine the pre- mises." "Yes, sir;" and in went the high constable, very  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC8357-00000086"/> 1G('   THE BURGESS OF TUMBLETOWN. cautiously. He crept stealthily through the entry, feeling his way from side to side, until a slight noise arrested his attention and progress. ' Who isit?" he asked in a whisper. "  Me;" answered Mr. Grigg, feeling- his way to the high constable. "Where's the Burgess?" "At the door," said Podgers. "Where's the mur- derer?" "In there," said Mr. Grigg, taking the constable's hand. "But I must see the Burgess." Together they stole back to the door, and finding Mr. Winkie and Snacks in waiting, they adjourned to the kitchen, struck a light, and being joined by the traveler, a council was held. After a brief discussion, it was considered best for all to go together, and by main force compel a surrender. Back therefore they went, walking boldly; Mr. Grigg leading the way with his candle. He threw open the door, and held it back, whilst Mr. Podgers entered, followed in order by Mr. Win- kie, the traveler, and Snacks; the latter very white in the face, and shaky in the limbs. The murderer was sitting before the fire. He seemed to be tired, and did not appear such a despe- rate villian, after all. He started, and turned his head as the party entered, apparently puzzled to understand the meaning of their coming. meani coming,   THE BURGESS OF TUMBLETOWN.     167 The Burgess took heart at the quiet demeanor of the man of blood, and advancing a few steps, cried out rather loud: "' You are my prisoner, sir! Surrender to the law." At this the prisoner sprang up in such a quick man- ner that the whole company rushed- back, and Mr. Winkie took refuge behind the stove. "Arrest him, constable," cried his honor, faintly. Mr. Podgers made a run at the murderer, but the latter drew his pistol, and the high constable stopped very short, and retreated behind the bar. Whereupon the murderer walked around to Mr. Winkie, and twisted his hand in Mr. Winkie's neck- cloth, and put the cold muzzle of the pistol to Mr. Winkie's forehead.         - "Oh-o-o- -m-m- ur-der! shrieked the Bur- gess, sinking to- the floor, his weak limbs refusing him support. "You'll arrest me,.will you, eh?" said the murderer, tauntingly. "I'm your prisonier, am I? I think not." Mr. Podgers was not a great coward, and his vene- ration for his superior officer helping his reviving cou- rage, he seized his club, and rushed bravely upon the murderer, with uplifted weapon. The latter jerked Mr. Winkie to his feet just as the club descended with fearful force, and the unfortunate Burgess received the blow on his bald-head, knocking  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC8357-00000087"/> 16(    THE BURGESS OF TUMBLETOWN. him almost senseless. Mr. Podgers dropped his club, aghast at his work, andi stood speechless. The murderer laughed, and seemed to enjoy the per- formance. . The sound -recalled the high constable to his senses. His blood was up now. He flew at the murderer savagely, dashed him against the wall, caught him by the throat, and wrenching the pistol from his hand, dealt him a blow on the head, which immediately ended the contest. The murderer surrendered, and Mr. Grigg, bringing in a rope, they bound him fast enough. Then Mr. Podgers turned his attention to Mr. Win- kie. 'The latter individual had not been hurt much, only stunned for a few moments, and was now sitting on the floor, rubbing his head, and staring wildly about him. The high constable assisted him to arise, and Mr. Winkie finding he could stand without difficulty, walked over to the helpless prisoner, and shook his fist in his face, until he was satisfied; his indignation and anger 6 being too deep for utterance. "You old scoundrel!" commenced the prisoner, vehemently; "I wish I was loose, you'd sufferfor this. I'll " "Take him away, and lock him up," ordered Mr. Winkie. "Anywhere, so he'll be safe."

"Leave him where he is. He can't get away. I'll stay, and see that he don't," said Podgers. "Very well," said Mr. Winkie. "So would I, but one is sufficient. I think he is fast enough." "No doubt of that," echoed the traveler, who had not found it necessary to endanger his person at all in the struggle. He was making himself comfortable by. the stove,' and enjoying a glass of brandy, which the landlord had set out for his benefit. "I'll keep Mr i Podgers company," he continued. "You shall be remembered, sir, in my report to the court," said the Burgess, generously. "Your valuable assistance this night shall not be forgotten. What name, sir?" "Dinks!" answered the traveler. "Mr. Dinks, in the name of Tumbletown I thank you," said Mr. Winkie, with dignity, pressing his breast with one hand, and offering the other to- Mr. Dinks, whilst he inclined his body forward gracefully. Mr. Dinks shook hands with Mr. Winkie, and assured him he merited no thanks. He had done so little. 15   &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC8357-00000088"/> 170    THE BURGESS OF TUMBLETOWN. "Do not say that," interrupted Mr. Winkie. "Your very presence here, upon the side of law and order, has been of inestimable benefit. It was unnecessary for you to do anything more, because Mr. Podgers-- faithful Podgers "--here Mr. Winkie removed the hand from his breast, and extended it to the high con- stable, who seemed much affected by such notice of his humble services. Mr. Winkie looked tenderly at his assistant, and continued: "Ever forgetful of his own safety, ever foremost to perform any duty, however arduous or dangerous."' He dropped their hands. Here the reckless prisoner laughed heartily. Mr. Winkie turned a withering look upon him, and walked away, followed by the landlord, with his tall candle. The high constable inspected the prisoner's bonds, and finding them all right, and that it was impossible for him to escape, drew a chair to the stove, and pre- pared to keep watch. ' Mr. Dinks, the traveler, remained awhile, talking; but soon complained of being tired, and, in need of sleep. Mr. Podgers assured him there was no neces- sity for him to lose his rest, as he could easily call him, if needed in an emergency. So Mr. Dinks said he believed he would go to bed, with many injunctions to be called up at once, if any- thing should happen. -Meanwhile, the landlord re- %.   THE BURGESS -OF TUMBLETOWN.    171 turned from lighting the Burgess across the street, and, the traveler bidding them 'good night," retired. "Nice man, that," remarked Mr. Podgers; ' I like him first-rate."' "Do you?" said Mr. Grigg; "so do I. Shall I stay here with you, Mr. Podgers?" "Oh, no! it's not, necessary; I can manage him. He'll be quiet enough, now. You can go to bed; you need your sleep more than most folks,"' said the con- stable, kindly. "1 Well," said the landlord, yawning, s"I'll do as you wish." Taking up his favorite candle, he snuffed it, and bade Mr. Podgers "4 good night." When he had been left alone a long time ith the prisoner, during which not a word was spoken, Mr. Podgers thought he observed his companion moving his body. Somewhat alarmed, he watched him sharply for a few moments, and then got up, and went boldly over, to make a closer inspection. Lo! the murderer was asleep, sitting uneasily in his chair. "Poor fellow!" murmured the humane constable, as he returned to his place. Mr. Podgers sat very quiet, trying to think over matters and things, until the room grew duskier, and the air oppressive to his eyelids. He found it a difficult task to keep them open, and -at length did not try any more; and so leaned his head-  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC8357-00000089"/> 172    THE' BURGESS OF TUMBLETOWN. back, and soon, sank into a long profound sleep. A violent shaking roused him from his dreams, "Help! help!" he cried, starting up, half awake. "What now, Mr. Podgers?" said Mr. Grigg, laugh- ing. "Who's hurting you?" Mr. Podgers rubbed his eyes, and stared about, as if out of his senses. It was broad daylight, and the vigilant guardian had been sleeping, undisturbed; for more than four hours. "Why, landlord! how is this? Was I nodding?" "I should say you were," answered Mr. Grigg, with emphasis. "You were sound asleep when I came in." "Oh, no!" expostulated Mr. Podgers. "Guess you're mistaken, landlord. Sleeping? not me!'"and the constable seemed a little offended at such an impu- tation upon his watchfulness. "Don't you think you were mistaken?" repeated Mr. Podgers. "Well!" said Mr. Grigg, seeing how things were going; "perhaps I was. I'll take it all back. You're too careful for such business. How's your prisoner?" "Fast enough," answered Mr. Podgers, proudly. "Catch him getting away from me. Guess he'd have to be sharper than most people." "Certainly," said Mr. Grigg. "You're a   proper man to be constable, Mr. Podgers. A   very proper man."   THE BURGESS OF TUMBLETOWN.     173 The landlord set about opening his house and bar, and proceeded to his usual morning duties. Mr. Podgers walked over to his prisoner, and asked: "t ow did you rest, sir?" "None of your business," was the curt reply, which rather staggered the constable. "Don't be cross," hecontinued; " it won't help you any. You'd better, by a good deal, be- civil. You may want a friend before you"-here Mr. Podgers put his hands to his throat, and made sundry motions, sufficiently significant to be readily-understood. "That's brave, to bully a helpless man, isn't it?" said the captive, bitterly. "Oh! it's quite manly in you to stand there, and insult me, when my hands and feet are tied with your cursed ropes. Untie them a bit, and then see if you dare say it?" Whether Mr. Podgers was ashamed of his conduct, or alarmed at the man's words, has never been settled; but he moved away, and walked out into the porch, keeping an eye on the chafing prisoner. "Fellow!" cried the latter--as Mr. Grigg came in;, "untie me, and stop this nonsense. You'll suffer for this outrage, all of you, or I'm not alive." "Then you're dead!" said the landlord, quietly; and you may shut your mouth, and keep your spleen to yourself. Nobody cares to-listen to a murderer." "A what?" said the other, savagely. 35*  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC8357-00000090"/> 174    THE BURGESS OF TUMBLETOWN. "I said it once," answered Mr. Grigg. "How often do you want to hear it? Does it sound pretty to you,?"' "You're an old jackass," said the prisoner. Mr. Grigg took no notice whatever of this remark, and commenced raking the fire. At this juncture, the door opened, and Mr. Podgers escorted in Mr. Winkie, and quite a number of people, whom the Burgess had notified of his important capture. "Is he safe?" asked Mr. Winkie, anxiously, as he came in. "All right, your honor," said Mr. Podgers. "I watched him all night. He's a desperate fellow, as your honor'has had cause to know." "Yes," answered Mr. Winkie, tapping his head. "I do know it; my head knows it, too." Mr. Grigg was kept busy answering the hundred questions put by the astonished natives of Tumbletown. When. they had gathered all the information, and understood what a tremendous duty Mr. Winkie had performed, they cried "Hurrah for the Burgess;- Iurrah! hurrah!" and. they made quite a commotion, and pressed forward to take that delighted functionary by the hand, and assure him of their unbounded con- fidence in his administration ofjustice. In the midst of the clamor a close carriage was driven up, and stopped before the door.   .    THE BURGESS OF TUMBLETOWN.     175 Landlord Grigg bustled out, and assisted a cloaked gentleman and a veiled lady to alight. He ushered them into the private parlor of the Crow and Eagle, and begged to know their wishes. "We wish breakfast, landlord," said the gentleman. "This is my wife.--We were married last night, in somewhat of a hurry," and the gentleman looked ex- pressively at Mr. Grigg. "Yes, sir;, I understand," said the latter; "You shall have breakfast in a few moments. Make your- selves at home." "What is the occasion of that crowd?" asked the gentleman. "Why, you must know!" returned the landlord; "that a murder was committed yesterday, or, the night before, rather, in Clayton, and we caught the murderer here, last night."       , -"You did!" exclaimed both his listeners. "Yes; he's in the bar-room now." "I must have a peep at him," said the newly made husband.           - He followed Mr. Grigg to the door of the bar-room and looked to where he pointed. "What!" he cried, as the prisoner turned his gaze upon him, with a strange expression in his eyes. "Can I believe my senses. You here,-arrested for murder!" said the gentleman, crossing the floor to  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC8357-00000091"/> 176    THE BURGESS OF TUMBLETOWN. the prisoner, and offering his han(. "Forgive me, Emlin! Come, youo don't bear me ill will; I know you cannot. But, stop a moment.-Landlord!" "Well, sir!" answered the much astonished Mr. Grigg, "Have this gentleman released immediately, and send away this crowd. There is some mistake here. This individual whom you brand as a murderer, is Squire Emlin's son, of Avon, whom some of you must have heard of."' With these words the gentleman took out his pen- knife, and was proceeding to cut the rope, when Mr. Winkie came forward- "Not so fast, my fine fellow!" said the Burgess, pompously; "He is my prisoner, and until I am satisfied he must not be set free." "' How!" said the gentleman, indignantly; "Don't you believe me?" "No!-" retorted Mr. Winkie, grandly; "You may be as bad as he is. At any rate, you shall not interfere, Mr. Podgers!" "Your honor!" "Stand by the prisoner?" The high -constable drew his club and assumed a threatening aspect. "This is outrageous!" exclaimed the gentleman, looking from one to another of the group, as if seeking   THE BURGESS OF TUMBLETOWN.     1" help in the difficulty; "Don't any of you know Squire Emlin?" No one answering, he appeared to almost despair of effecting his purpose. Just then the bride emerged from the private parlor, alarmed at hearing the dispute. "My dear brother!" she cried, running across the room and throwing her arms about the prisoner's neck; "What is the'meaning of this? Who are these rude men, and why are you here, tied in this fashion? Cut him loose, John!" she said, in a firm tone. "My dear lady, ma'am!" expostulated Mr. Winkie, touching her arm gently; "H-we--" "Cut the rope, I say!" she interrupted; Give me the knife!" and, despite the presence of Mr. Podgers, the prisoner was set free in an instant. The high constable could not strike a lady--young and handsome at that. '"Now then, what do you want?" she asked, sternly; confronting the astonished Tumbletowners. Not one answered. Even Mr. Winkie was non- plussed.  He began to think he had been too hasty. Here another carriage drove up to the door, and three men jumped out, and came hastily in. "What's the trouble here?" asked one,-a burly man, evidently the leader of the trio. /     &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC8357-00000092"/> 178    THE BURGESS OF TI;'MBLETOWN. A dozen voices began explanations, in a dozen differ- ent ways. At length thenew comers learned the cause of the commotion. . The burly man pressed through the throng, and immediately exclaimed, "That is not the man. You've taken up the wrong individual!".  "Ah!" said Mr Winkie, and "Ah!" echoed Mr. Grigg, whilst Podgers scratched his head and said nothing. "The right man is shorter, stouter, and has a red face."      - ;  Landlord Grigg turned pale, and stepped out of the room.  Hastening up to the traveler's apartment, he knocked, but no one responded.  He tried the door. It was unlocked. He opened it a little, and looked in. The room was tenantless.  Mr. Grigg shook as if with a severe chill and entered. On the table he espied a paper.  He took it up and read:-- "I'm sorry I cannot stay longer; but delay might prove danger- ous. Give my respects to your friend Winkie. Tell him he's made a slight mistake. His prisoner is not the Clayton murderer.--I am the man!" [Signe'd,]    BBLAIR, . alias Dinks. The paper fell from Mr. Grigg's paralyzed hands, and he dropped into a chair as if death struck.   THE BURGESS OF TUMBLETOWN.    179 The awful discovery tha tthe real murderer had been there--that he had been friendly with him-had waited upon him, and had touched his hand. That he could have been so easily arrested, and yet had escaped. Had cooly walked away and no attempt made to detain him. And that he, (Mr. Grigg,) had been instrumental in -having an innocent man outraged and beaten in his blind zeal to serve the law. It was too much to bear in quiet. Mr. Grigg groaned, and wrung his hands, and shook his head, and seemed likely to go crazy. Some one called him. - He took no notice of it.- Another call, and then there were foot-steps on the stairs; and yet the landlord sat there, wringing his hands. The door opened, and Mr. Podgers walked in and laid his hand upon the troubled man's shoulder. He was about to speak, but Mr. Grigg pointed to the paper on the floor, and buried- his face in his hands. The high constable stooped and picked up the paper. It required but a few seconds to read it. Folding it up very small, he placed it in his pocket and walked out, and down to the bar-room, and sought out Mr. Winkie, and whispered something in his ear. The Burgess turned to the people, and bade them withdraw. He said they should have an explanation at another time.  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC8357-00000093"/> 180   THE BURGESS OF TUMBLETOWN. When they were gone Mr. Podgers produced the paper, which all read with astonishment, mingled with shame and anger. "Dear me!" exclaimed the Burgess; '"What a mis- take! How strange, and yet quite natural when I think. You must admit it was natural to suspect you. Was it not?" and Mr. Winkie looked at the late pri- soner's vest, not having courage enough to lift his eyes any higher. "Perhaps so," returned the latter. "It did look suspicious, I'll admit. As I understand it now, I'm willing to forgive and forget." He extended his hand, and Mr. Winkie seized it eagerly, and seemed deeply affected. When Messrs. Grigg and Podgers had imita- ted ,the Burgess, the latter said, "May I ask how you chanced to come here, in such a plight, at such an hour? "Certainly!

As soon as he was informed of matters and things, he sent me off, post haste on horseback, to run them down. I had a rough time of it, in the rain and mud, until I reached here, when my horse gave out. I dismounted and found all closed; but soon woke up the landlord, whom in the dim room, I mistook for a frightened servant man, from his appearance and behavior. I asked for a horse to continue my travels, and he went out as if to do as I requested. He was gone some twenty minutes and I sat down before the stove, half inclined to stay here" for the storm dnd ride had made me tired and sleepy. At the end of that time, I heard quite a noise of feet, the door was opened, and in walked the land- lord and two or three more, and you-nodding to Mr". Winkie--can supply the rest." Then the Burgess told his story, which needed the additional explanation of Mr. Grigg to clear up the mystery. Thus it. became clear to every one. The burly man and his companions who were from Clayton, and in quest of :the -murderer, now departed-to prose- cute their search,  The gentlemen from Avon then ordered a dinner to be served, and pressed the Burgess and his redoubtable right-hand man to honor the table with their company. Mr. Winkie acknowledged and accepted the invita- tion for himself and friend, with becoming dignity. 16 * as                 , A. y  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC8357-00000094"/> 182    THE BURGESS OF TUMBLETOWN. The dinner was served at a proper hour, in the best room of the Crow and Eagle. There were only five in the company, but they managed to have quite a jolly, good time.: Mr. Winkie was particularly felicitous, and talked incessantly. He made many gallant and witty speeches to the bride and her husbad, and ate a great deal and seemed exceedingly happy to have so pleasant a termination to their unfortunate mistake. After dinner, Mr. Winkie indulged rather freely in the liquors, and Mr. Podgers not daring to act differently, followed suit; until both became highly exhilarated, and in that agreeable condition, retired at a late hour, after begging pardon of the gentlemen a dozen times, and protesting that they should never forgive themselves for the unintentional--entirely un- intentional injury they had done him! The Burgess and his faithful auxiliary, departed down the street, arm-in-arm, pursuing a somewhat zig- zag course, and going over double the necessary quan- tity of ground, to arrive at their homes. The runaway pair soon after entered their carriage ; and the forgiving brother mounted his rested horse, and together they were driven and rode away, leaving landlord Grigg a wiser and a sadder man.   MiR. FUSBY was a married man, and a man of family. Mrs. Fusby, however, was the head of the house. She had assumed that position, immediately upon arriving there, after their wedding trip. She reigned in her small kingdom  an. absolute monarch. Not, that Mr. Fusby was a helpless, abject, cringing subject, and she a virago in person and man- ners. Far from it.  No gentler being, apparently, ever breathed; and Mr. Fusby was a good-sized, strong and hearty man. Therefore, in a physical point of view, he eould easily have been master. - But she managed in this way: Did she wish for anything, and was Mr. Fusby foolish enough to refuse her; she did tot argue with him, or scold, or appear sullen. No--she allowed her silent submission to so pray upon her delicate constitution, and had it so much to heart, that she invariably took to her bed, and remained there in suffering and misery, until her cruel partner relented, which, he never failed to do, in three days at farthest. Three cherubs, so Mrs. Fusby styled them, although her lord was not quite inclined to agree with- her in that opinion, had, blessed their home with their coming, and remaining, also.

Thoroughly spoiled by their mother's indulgence, and her protection from their father's attempts at correction, they occasioned a sad time for Mr. Fusby, in the frequent visitations of weakness to his wife. Mr. Fusby's mother-in-law did not like him. She always treated him as though he was a great villain, who, had by wiles and flattery, enticed away the lamb of her flock. She never hesi- tated to let Mr. Fusby see how contemptible she con- sidered him. He -had, moreover, two brothers-in-law; good enough in their way, but not exactly to Mr. Fusby's taste, as boon companions. These individuals seemed to have imbibed a no small share of their mother's -antipathy to poor Fusby. They used him very badly, save when they chose to honor him with their due bills, for value received; which, they did rrather oftener than was convenient for their accom- modating brother-in-law. l But Mr./ Fusby bore every thing like a martyr, and strove to be happy, notwithstanding his accumulated discomforts. In the course of human events, it became necessary for him to make a journey, to be absent about three days. But little clothing was needed, and so he purchased a neat, black carpet sack, and took it home for Mrs. Fusby to pack. She always did such things for him.   MR. FUSBY'S JOURNEY.      185 From the beginning, she had accustomed herself to relieve him of all troublesome matters. He was not allowed to perform, the simplest duty appertaining to house-keeping. There may have been a shrewd policy in this. At least, Mr. Fusby found himself in a sad predicament, whenever his loving partner deemed it necessary to take to her room and bed; thus leaving everything at odds and ends in the house. But the journey was before him; so the- carpet-sack was duly packed and committed to him, with numerous injunctions to take care of himself, on account of his innocent and dependent family. He bade them adieu in the most affectionate man- ner. In truth, when he called to mind, that Mrs. Fusby might possibly be taken ill in his absence, a tear glistened in his eye, and he found it requisite to draw forth his bandanna, and bury his face- in its ampli- tude; whilst he hurried away, not trusting to look back at his bereaved ones. Mr. Fusby, however, was not of a mind to look long upon the gloomy side of the picture. He knew tha;t partings were not forever, and not always avoidable. He concluded to make the best of it, and enjoy-himself. His trip, therefore, was rather a pleasant one. He found himself in company with several unprotected, timid young ladies, in whom he took a fatherly interest "They are so innocent of the deceitfulness of this 16*  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC8357-00000096"/> 186     MR. FUSBY'S JOURNEY. world, he would murmur, and need the guardianship of some responsible individual, some steady, respectable, elderly person, and man of family, like myself. The handsomer they were, the more Mr. Fusby deemed it his imperative duty to see that they were not insulted or imposed upon. Thus he was always in agreeable and fascinating society, and never found his ride wearisome. When necessity obliged him to part from these innocent maidens, Mr. Fusby always seemed very loath to see them leave his protecting presence, and would take their hands, kindly, and,hold them a long time, whilst he seemed thinking of some excellent advice, appro- priate to the occasion. In such pleasant manifesta- tions of good-will to his neighbors, Mr. Fusby pur- sued his journey. In due time he effected his business, and prepared to return. He stepped aboard the late afternoon train, and ensconced himself for an uncomfortable ride. The evening promised to be cold and cheerless. The day had been cloudy and misty, and now a, slight rain was falling. Placing his carpet sack by his feet, he wrapped his scarf about his neck aud face, and was ready to take things as they should come-good or bad. In front of PMr. Fusby sat a -lady dressed in black. When the train stopped for a few moments at the first station,   MR. FUSBY'S JOURNEY.      187 the lady arose to procure a drink. The train started before she could effect her purpose, and she hastened to return to her seat. She was jostled into Mr. Fusby's arms, for that gentleman had opportunely arisen, foreseeing the consequences, and prepared himself accordingly. Assisting her to her seat, Mr. Fusby gallantly procured the water, and waited upon his blushing, fellow-passenger. She thanked him, without lifting her eyes, in a -very modest manner. She was quite handsome, and had a low, sweet voice. Of course, the remainder of the homeward journey, Mr. Fusby assumed charge of his fair friend, and paid every attention to her comfort. She was going to the city where Mr. Fusby resided, to pay a visit to a sister living there-but not directly. She purposed stop- ping, a few days, at a town on the road. So when the train arrived at the desired station, Mr. Fusby got out to see to her baggage; whilst the conductor assisted her off the car.  ' "Mr. Fusby had scarcely time to say adieu, when the whistle sounded,' and he was obliged to jump aboard, and they were off again. He reached his home in safety, and was received with proper manifestations of affection. Handing his carpet sack to Mrs. Fusby, he retired to perform his ablutions. He had barely begun to wash his face, when he was startled by the sudden appearing of his  . *       &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC8357-00000097"/> 188     .MR. USBY'S JOURNEY. loved wifer in a very excited condition. Pale and trembling, she stood beforie him, and gazed steadily upon him.; with tears gathering in her eyes. Mr. Fusby began to feel queer. He had never seen her in such a state before. She seemed devoid of life or motion. 'Mr. Fusby's knees shook, and he could hardly find utterance. "Well, my love!" at last he ventured; "What is the matter now? You're ill again! Letme assist you to your room!" and he advanced to do so. "Off!" she said' feebly; "Don't touch me!" and sank to the floor. Mr. Fusby was somewhat alarmed. She had always before managed to drop on the bed.--Here was some thing new. But in the few seconds he stood thinking what to do, he heard the front door open, and footsteps ascended the stairs, and presently Mrs. Fusby's mother entered the room, in quest-of her daughter. She rushed at Mr. Fusby, nearly pushing him off his feet, and cried, "You're a brute, sir! to throw your poor, delicate, helpless wife down.-Shame on you!  Get-out of the way!" and the fond mother assisted her daughter to arise; helped her into her room, and shut and locked the door in Mr. Fusby's face. Poor mlan! iHe went disconsolately to the cheerless,   MR. FUSBY 'S JOURNEY.     189 supperless kitchen, and, seating himself by the cold stove, fell to thinking. In his thoughts:--sick wives, unruly, turbulent children, cross, meddlesome mothers. in-law, and domineering, troublesome brothers-in-law were painfully contrasted with pleasant rides in cozy cars; young, blooming, kindly maidens-all life, health, and sweetness; and agreeable chats and acquaintances. He was too much accustomed to his wife's fits, to feel alarmed on her account; and too tired to think much about it, one way or the other. He presumed she would be all right again, in the morning, or, the next day, at the furthest. When hunger interrupted his musings, he looked up some cold victuals, and made out a miserable repast. Then, finding everything was still in the house, he crept away to bed in an attic room, and found relief in balmy sleep-- for troubles did not visit Mr. Fusby in his dreams. He was weary, and slept long; far into the: morning. When he awoke, the rain was over, and the day beautifully clear and bright.- Mr. Fusby arose, and dressed himself; feeling quite cheerful and happy. But, suddenly the remem-, brance of the previous evening flitted across his mind, and made him feel uncomfortable. Having finishhd his toilet, he repaired to the dining- room first, to make a reconnoissance, but could see no appearance of breakfast,--then to the- kitchen; but no evidences of preparation. Everything was just as he  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC8357-00000098"/> : 90     MRB. BUSBY'S JOURNEY. had left them, the night-before. Somewhat astonished, he -;went to seek :his wife in her, bed-chamber. The door waswpartly open, but no one within.  Upon the ,.unused bed was, Mr. Fusby's carpet-sack, and dis- tributed. onspicuously :about, were sundry articles of female apparel, apparently just removed from the open- mouthed sack. In much wonderment, he continued his search, until he was confident he was alone.--Wife, children, mother-in-law,-all were gone. A closer investigation of the bed and its contents, disclosed a note directed to him. He read,-- "Abandoned man. No longer worthy to be a husband and father. The evidences of your unblushing infidelity convince me that you are both wicked and heartless. I shall leave you to your impurity.1"          ANNA. Mr e Fusby dropped the note, and made a careful examination of the carpet-sack. He readily understood the cause of the difficulty. The carpet-sack, although wonderfullylike, was not his own i By some odd error, he had appropriated one belonging to a female passen- ger,--well filled' with all kinds of women's clothing and ; appurtenances. Amongst -the collection, were several letters in delicate envelopes. The letters were addressed to "My darling Nellie," and signed, "Your loving Frank!,: The writing was very much like Mr. Fusby's, and his middle-name was Frank. Here then, was the cd   MR. FUSBY' S JOURNEY.     191 cause of his wife's stampede with the -children. She was leaving him to reflect upon his villainy. What was he to do! No wife, no children,-bad as they had been, he missed them. No breakfast, no fire--nothing in the house to eat,-getting late, and he hungry. He sat down to cogitate, when a terrific jerk of the door-bell aroused him to action. Hurrying to the door, he was confronted by his amiable:brothers-in-law. They had heard of the insult to their. sister, their mother, and themselves; and had come to demand some little personal satisfaction. Mr. Fusby was indignant, and ordered them to clear out, and mind their own business. Whereupon, they intimated, that it would afford them pleasure to kick himn into the street, or, to batter his head into a jelly; but that he was too small game for their notice,--that he was too degraded for them, even to kick. They furthermore said, that, in consideration of receiving certain documents, setting forth that they were indebted to him, they would go, and leave him to his own vile reflections. Mr. Fusby being a man of peaceful habits and educa- tion, was, for a moment, averse to war; and so drew out the due-bills, and was about- handing them :over, when a second thought changed hisdetermination. He stepped quickly into the kitchen, seized a large poker, and rushing: out suddenly, aimed a blow at the larger ,man, which was dexterously avoided, and another at the -N..  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC8357-00000099"/> 192      MR. FUSBY'S JOURNEY. other brother, which he failed to escape from, and con- sequently had his head nearly knocked off. Mr. Fusby was excited. Other blows were made in rapid succes- sion-at each, alternately, ,until the valorous brothers considering close quarters objectionable, beat a retreat in much haste, carrying with them sundry marks of the free use of the poker. As the last brother cleared the door, Mr. Fusby assisted his exit with his boot, and then closing the door, ran back to the kitchen, and sitting down, enjoyed a good laugh. He wondered at himself at first, but now, that he had discovered he was possessed of strength, he determined to be master in future,-wife or no wife. Mr. Fusby began to feel much better. His little exploit had been of immense benefit. It had developed his hitherto latent powers, and was in a fair way to discover others--of mind, as well as body. He went down town for breakfast; and took his other meals there also. For more than a week Mr. Fusby lived in this style, and was rapidly becoming addicted to his old-bachelor habits. In fact, he seemed to like the quiet house, when at home, and the excel- lent meals when abroad. He lbegan to think it advisa- ble for Mrs. Fusby to be near her mother, as she was always in such delicate health. Then he concluded it would be nice, if he had no care of a  house. He would rent his, furnished,   ,   .   MR. FUSBY'S JOURNEY.      193 retaining a room for his own use. So he advertised freely, and' had numerous applicants. One morning he was-in waiting at the house to receive visitors, The bell sounded, and he opened the door. There stood Mrs. Fusby, her mother, and the children. Mr. Fusby invited them to enter. -" Did you wish to look at the house, ma'am?" asked he very politely, looking demurely at his wife. "I would prefer a family without children." The ladies were astonished. They had seen the advertisement, and were alarmed at Mr., Fusby's pro- ceedings. "Would he dare do such a thing, the wretch. Allow strangers to use the furniture?'" Mrs. Fusby's mother was wroth, and urged her daughter to go and maintain her rights. So they were come, expecting to make poor Fusby quake in his boots. But the quiet, submissive man had departed, and in his place was quite a different individual. Just as quiet, but there was a certain determined expression of his eyes, and his manners gave evidence of a change. Mrs. Fusby could not say a word, and her mother did not like the appearance of things, and so kept quiet. In another moment a second ringing of the bell summoned Mr*- Fusby to the door again.

There's not an eatable in the house," said Mr. Fuiby. "Will you see to it, dear?" "Immediately!" answered his joyful wife; and she withdrew.  At the breakfast-table it was explained, that the cousin's carpet-sack was just like Mr. Fusby's, in every respect-they were one make. f They had been dis. placed under the seats, by the motion of the car, and the lady had taken up the wrong one, in her haste to get out. Of course, Mr. Fusby brought the other one home without noticing tho exchange.  Hence the trouble in his household. Now, however, harmony was fully restored, and promised to never again be disturbed. Mr. Fusby was not annoyed by a recur- rence of his wife's disorder; and as his mother-in-law was never able to do enough for him; and as the brothers-in-law had likewise learned a lesson, peace reigned in his home, and everywhere else; and he blessed the day he set out upon the journey, 'N   *    JOB GEETS was a rich, avaricious, miserly fellow. He was, moreover, hard-hearted, unfeeling, and often exceedingly rough to his tenants, for Job was a landlord, and had collected his rent for many years with zealous care-never abating a farthing, nor suffering an hour's delay. Some people averred that Job Geets had no heart. Not a man, woman or child in the whole vil- lage, could remember of ever seeing him smile or weep. If his face was an index of his heart, the latter must have been very flinty in its nature, for his countenance- never changed-always stern, chilling and repulsive., He asked no favors and granted none. Job was a. bachelor, and-lived in a large, old-fashioned building, just outside the village. Saving the presence, of a widowed sister, he dwelt alone, One day in mid-winter, after an early breakfast, Job took his great stick, and walked briskly.-into the, village. He had a number of rents to collect from the poorer portion of his tenants, and calculated in his mind as he moved along, what to do with such as might not be ready. His first stopping place was before a tumble-down 17*             .  &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC8357-00000102"/> 198      THE GOBLIN'S LESSON. sort of a building-between a house and a shanty- very shabby and wretched in appearance. With a lively rap, he placed his hand on the latch and opened the door a few inches; a low voice said '"Come in," Mr. :Geets went in; and took his stand near the fire- place, almost empty of coals. The room was scantly furnished, and every thing gave evidence of extreme want and misery. A feeble, wearied young woman, sat holding a sick infant in her arms, whilst two other little ones, crouched on the floor in a corner, munching -dry bread and shrink- ing fromr the. cold air that had entered in company with Job Geets. "Now then!" exclaimed that- individual, scarcely waiting a moment, "what are you looking at me for ; why don't you bustle about? Don't keep me waiting on you, all day. Come where is my money?" "Please sir, Mr. Geets," began the young woman, in a sad voice,.' I have been sick, very sick, for near- ly two weeks, and have not been able to get the rent ready by to-day. Won't you please be so kind as to. give me a few days more, and-'" '"Not an hour " thundered Mr. Geets, "not anf hour, not a half. What business have you here, if you can't pay :the. rent?

"No, no; I'll do nothing of the kind. You can't pay it, and so you must clear out-right away. See! now; I'll help you to move! Suiting the action to the word, Job Geets speedily placed the few articles of furniture in the street, and having locked the door, walked off, leaving the poor woman and her little ones, shivering, amidst their wretchedness. Job Geets continued his walk, finished his business, and returned home a After dinner, he went into his bed room, as usual, to count his money, which having done, he took up a lantern and a huge key and proceeded to the cellar. Traversing several gloomy passages, he stopped, be- fore a small iron door in a strong wall. Adjusting the key to the rusty lock, he gave a turn and threw it open. Passing in, he closed the door and locked it. This was Job's treasure vault. He had come to de- posit the result of that. day's collection. The vault contained nothing but an iron-bound chest, which was placed in one corner. Setting his lantern on-the floor, Job applied another key to the huge padlock, confin- )  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC8357-00000103"/> THE GOBLIN'S LESSON. : ing the great hasp, and soon lifted the lid. The, box was nearly full of bags, containing gold and silver, and packages of dark looking papers. Taking out one of the bags, he untied the mouth and put in it the money he had brought. Replacing it he knelt a few moments, contemplating the treasure before him then spoke half aloud, All mine, all mine." " You lie !" said a voice apparently just behind him. Job turned very pale, and glanced nervously about him, but observing no one, murmured, Only my fancy." "You lie again, Job -Geets !" said the voice, and starting up, Job looked behind him. To his horror, he beheld a frightful figure standing in front of the iron door, leering strangely at him.    / The figure was that of a tall, dark-featured man, shrouded in a black mantle, his eyes fearful to see, They seemed on fire, and the expression of his counte- nance did not tend to soothe Job's terror. Job Geets was an arrant coward, despite his bravado when dealing with his cowed tenants and creditors. His whole frame shook with great fear, as he stood spell-bound before the grim  visitor, whom he at once saw was not a common one, in this world. "How are you, Job Geets?" questioned the un- welcome-intruder, quietly.   4   THE GOBLIN'S LESSON.,         201 'I--Id--don't feel well," stammered Job; the words tumbled helplessly out, and his teeth rattled like castanets.  "Not well, eh! poor fellow ?" chuckled the goblin, with a peculiar look upon his chilling face. "Feel bad, do you; what is wrong, Job ?" "I-I-d-don't know, sir !" answered Job, half dead from fear. (' I'll tell you, then; shall I Job-eh ? Your heart is affected; am I right ?" and the goblin advanced and poked Job familiary in the region where that portion of the human anatomy is situated. Job fell back a yard or two from  the unpleasant contact, and could not answer a word. "Oh! come now, Job, tell me, is it the -heart, eh ? speak out, Job." "I-I-don't know; I guess you're right, sir," said Job, afraid to offer a dissenting opinion. "The trouble is, your heart is too hard, Job; wants softening, eh, Job ?" and the goblin again approached the unfortunate possessor of the hard-heart, and clasp- ing his waist, whispered in his ear, with a very hot breath-" I'll melt it for you. Come !" To Job's unutterable horror and despair the earth opened, and down they went-down-down-down- through blackness and stifling heat, into an immense cavern, seemingly in the bowels of the earth. &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC8357-00000104"/> 202      THE GOBLIN'S LESSON. A chorus of unearthly voices shrieked a fearful welcome to Job and his captor. Job seemed pos- sessed of a supernatural strength, for, despite the dreadful circumstances attending his condition he did not faint or sink under the great fear which agonized him, but was able to steal a timid glance around him. The place was dark, save in front of him for a little distance, where a scorching fire fiercely crackled, and sent its tongues high above the pit in which it was burning. Dancing about it, and flitting in and out of the heavy shades which rested upon the remainder of the cavern, were any number of strange, dusky, fear- ful beings, and not a few were amusing themselves, jumping in and through the great fire, which seemed kindly disposed towards them, and did- not even singe their naked bodies. They seemed to be keeping a holiday because of Job's coming. "What shall we do for Job Geet's heart, which is too hard for his comfort?" said the tall goblin. "Melt it!" shrieked the unearthly chorus, and a hundred eyes glared and winked horribly before Job. "What do you say to that, Job Geets, eh? asked his captor, grinning most ghostly. "H--d-don't t-think it necessary, sir, if you please," answered Mr. Geets. I think not, sir, if I may be allowed to speak." "Oh, ho! you're wrong," said the tall goblin, "I'm ),   THE GOBLIN'S LESSON.     203 afraid you're wrong," and the unearthly chorus re- sponded, "Oh, ho! oh, ho!" in a manner which made Mr. Geets' hair stand up at once. "We know better, you see," said Job's interested friend. 'No harm to try it, at any rate,. eh-?" said the tall goblin, looking at his friends. "Try it! try it!" yelled the whole troop; and there- upon they cut such capers and performed suich bewil- dering antics that Job's overstrained brain was entirely confused. He would have sunk insensible but for the tall goblin, who supported him, at the same giving him a hot pinch to keep him awake. "Look, Job!" whispered his supporter, waving his hand. "What do you see? A pretty picture, Job; a pleasant, cheerful scene, eh?" Job looked; he could not do otherwise. On one side the shades had parted and revealed a familiar-view; a -street in his own village-one of his own tenaments! "Look closely, Job!" whispered the tall goblin. It was plain enough; he easily recognized the poor widow and) her children, whom he had put in the snowy street that morning. She held a dying babe to her exhausted breast, and seemed herself ready to sink into death. The howling Wiinds-Job could'hear them- were cutting queer blue figures on their hunger-pinched? faces. Behind her, snugly wrapped in a great coat  i* X*    -        &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC8357-00000105"/> 204      THE GOBLIN'S LESSON. and furs, was somebody very like Job, adding to her , misery by taunting, cruel words. Job involuntarily closed his eyes. "Ready i" called the tall goblin. "Yes! yes!" answered the unearthly chorus: and, as Job opened his. eyes in deadly fear of some impend- ing doom, he beheld a huge cauldron suspended over the great fire. From its depths issued a bubbling noise and curls of steam, indicating a very warm tern- 4 perature of its contents. "Now, then!" shouted the goblin. "In with the man whose heart is callous to the cries of the poor and the suffering; in with him!" and Job saw them spring upon him ; they caught him up as if he were a feather, rushed him to the cauldron and held him above it. A moment he was permitted to gaze into the seething, tumbling mass within, and then a plunge, and Job gave forth an awful shriek, and made a jump, and found himself-upon the floor of his bed-room! It was" all a dream-a horrid night-mare! He had gone into his bedroom after dinner, as usual, and had fallen asleep. Job arose, and, pressing his hand over his eyes, looked cautiously about him, as though fearing to meet the faces of the goblin visitor and his friends. But the room was still and he was alone. An hour he sat motionless, gazing, fixedly, into the glowing coals before him. Then, with a great sigh, he arose, and     THE GOBLIN'S LESSON.     205 arrayed himself for a walk. Taking his great stick he he strode quietly out, and hastened again to the village. What all he did there I may not say; but this much I know-the poor widow and her little ones slept,- that night, in comfortable beds, in a nice home, and many a- poor villager added to his evening prayer a thanks- giving for the blessings sent through Job Geets. Job had changed, and, ever after, was the widow's friend and the patron of the poor. 18 O ,  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC8357-00000106"/> A STORY OF CHEERWING VALLEY. CHAPTER I. "THE lowering clouds give promise of a rough night, wife," said the old weather-beaten ferryman, as he gazed upon the troubled face of startled nature. "If I mistake not my reckoning 'twill blow a hurri- cane afore midnight." "True for you, John," said his wife, who was standing in the door-way, awaiting his coming to sup- per.

He assisted his father in managing and propelling the, boat across the ferry.   . The day had been raw and cold, and but few tra- velers had required the services of the old ferryman. As evening came on apace, the sky darkened before the great sluggish clouds that loomed up over the brow of the mountain. The river, too, assumed a sombre hue, as the shadows fell upon its ice-burdened surface. The road passing through the northwestern section of Virginia into Pennsylvania, after leaving the vil- lage of Ganmore, leaHs round the base of the Chest- nut Ridge, and thence up the valley of Cheerwing. Some thirty miles from the entrance of the valley, it is intercepted by a river, nearly half a mile wide. It was here the ferry-house was located, on the left bank, near the foot of the mountain.  From the rear door-way, a view was had of the gorge through which the stream coursed its tortuous way, and also afforded a glimse of the western sky. , It was a romantic and beautiful spot, with the val- ley stretching far away, on either -side, hemmed in by the two opposite ranges of mountains, and the river flowing through a deep cdt in one near by, and wend- ing its usually silent way towards the other, through which it found a like passage. The ferryman, an honest, kindly disposed man, who had seen many  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC8357-00000107"/> 208       THE STRANGER. rough times, had lived here with his family for twelve years. "We will go now, and draw the boat high on the shore, for I warrant no one will come this way to- night," said the ferryman, as he finished his repast. They were not long gone, and after their return they secured the fastenings, and talked of the storm until bed-time. As 'evening waned into night, the sounds without gave indications of the increasing force of the tempest. The winds whistled loudly around the hum- ble dwelling, whilst the trees on the mountain side groaned and cracked, as the fitful blasts rushed upon them. The hands of the clock pointed to the hour of eleven, when the sound of horses' feet striking rapidly the flinty road, rang sharply out on the air, above the noise of the contending elements. Soon after, the old ferry- man -was aroused by a vigorous pounding upon the door, and starting up, he seized a lantern, and open- ing the casement above the porch, peered forth into the black night.. "What is- your will?" cried he. "I would cross the river," replied a coarse voice, and a man stepped into the road and looked up. The old man bade him wait, and then hastened to admit him to the house. The ill-timed rider was muf- fled closely, and, approaching the fire-place, where a   THE STRANGER.       209 few coals emitted a slight warmth, he turned his back to the ferrymnan, as the latter said: - "I fear, sir, I can do nothing-for you in that way to night. It will be almost impossible to withstand the hurricane which will soon be upon us. Better wait until dawn-by that time the wind may lull, and you can then speedily be on your way." "Can't do it!" answered the stranger, without moving; "I must cross that river now, if I have to swim my horse." "But the river is dangerous," said the ferryman, "on account of the ice the winds are sending down." "Are you afraid?" asked the other with a sneer. "No, sir; but I value my life too highly to rashy throw it away. -So content yourself with us until morning."  "See here!" said the stranger, turning abruptly and exhibiting at countenance, the aspect of which rather alarmed the old man ;  "I must-must, do you hear? -cross to-night-now! I have already lost much pre- cious time in talking, when acting would have been more to the purpose. Life or death depends upon the event. Come-here is gold for you," tossing him a heavy purse, " and a-'like sum if landed on the oppo- site side in an hour." Now, the old man, although not avaricious or 18* -                    &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC8357-00000108"/> 210       THE STRANGER, miserly, loved the bright gold, and its clink was plea- sant to his ear. "Well," said he, slowly, "I'll venture to make a trial, anyhow; may be we can work through. Ho! Harry! awake, boy!" and, shaking his son out of his dreams, he told him to make ready to try the ferry, and to awaken his mother and inform her of the mat- ter.- The good wife strove to dissuade them from the attempt, but the old man told her he had promised, and would go, if but a few yards. When all were ready, they set out, the ferryman leading the way with a lantern, the light of which was a mockery in the dense blackness that almost hid the. one from the other. The stranger followed, the bridle of his horse in his hand, and the youth brought up the rear, bear- ing the boat poles. The winds were fairly howling in their madness, and came upon them with a force that every instant threatened to dash them to the ground, whilst the drifting snow which was falling rapidly, J whirled into their faces with almost blinding effect. The spirit of the storm was abroad in its might. A dull heavy sound came from the river, where the waters were lashed into fury, with the ice crashing and roaring, as borne on by the rapid current; the huge blocks were ground together. With care they reached the boat. The old man placed his light on the bank,   THE STRANGER.       2" sheltered by a large rock from the tempest, and stood a moment in thought, "Ia!" he cried, as the stranger started," now you see for yourself-what say you-shall we go back?" "No!" returned the latter; only hasten-let us be, off." "Very well; come boy, bear ..a hand. And you, sir, might assist, if you will." The stranger did so, pushing with all his strength, and the boat was speedily in the water. The horse was led in and fastened, and the -ferryman, now anxious to lose no time, shoved off. The stranger stood in the bow, watching the blocks of ice, as they roared past the staunch boat, and would hold no conversation with his companions. The old man and his son toiled with giant strength, but the progress was slow, pain- fully slow ; and they were at times nearly prostrated by the sudden gusts of wind that blew keenly down the river. They dared not give up, however, and their passenger giving his aid, they succeded, after almost incredible exertions in grounding the boat on the right bank of the stream, though at some distance below the usual anchorage. The stranger mounted his horse, and rode off at a terrible speed, apparently forgetting to hand the ferryman the second purse promised; the latter being busy securing the fastening of the boat, and his son at the stern. Thev listened to the retreat- ing sounds, until they could no longer be heard; then'  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC8357-00000109"/> 2 12.  '    THE STRANGER. vith a sigh of disappointment, at missing the reward, they embarked again and retraced their journey with an energy that defied cold or storm. The boat being lighter, was less difficult to force through and over the ice, and after much labor they arrived safely at home. The wife and mother was anxiously awaiting the return of those dear to her, and had a blazing fire to welcome them. When she found them all right, a fer- vent prayer of thankfulness ascended to Him who rules the storm. After removing their wet garments, the old man said : "Wife, I don't understanda why that man should be abroad such a night as this," and he looked stead- fastly into the fire, as though he would there read an explanation. "Strange--very strange," returned his wife. Yes : he was well dressed-rode a fine horse- seemed to have plenty of money, (though he forgot to give me-the second purse promised,) and was appa- rently a gentleman. But why such haste on a night like this? I fear all is not as it should be." "Did you see his face, John?" "Only for a moment, and then the expression startled me. I wonder if this is honest gold? But what have you there? Ah! a key-must have drop- ped when he turned so suddenly. Singular shaped key, ain't it? I'll keep it; mayhap we shall hear again from the gentleman. And now let us to bed."   THE STRANGER.       213 CHAPTER II. ON the morning of the same day, in a stately mansion some thirty yards back from the road leading north- ward from the ferry, sat an old gentleman and a young lady. They were father and daughter-the former being a hale, cheerful man of sixty years, and the latter a maiden of about nineteen summers., A servant was engaged preparing breakfast, and his operations at length ceasing with the word "ready!" they drew near to partake. "Lilly," said the old gentleman; "I feel uneasy, and yet-pshaw! 'tis foolish to give it a thought-I-" "What, father?" "I had a dream of such a vivid nature, that I cannot banish the remembrance of it," and a perceptible shudder shook the old man's frame. "Why, what was it? please tell- me." "Well," and he strove to smile ; "I will; but 'twas nothing-a mere fancy of the night. I dreamed the day was raw and chilly, just such a oneas this, and we were in the drawing-room. Toward evening the sky clouded over, and a storm approached which threat- ened to be very severe. Whilst engaged talking, a rider. drew rein at the door and desired to see the owner of  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC8357-00000110"/> 214       THE STRANGER. the mansion. I thought he was ushered in at my order, and apologized for the intrusion; but mentioned the stoirn, as connected with his wish to have shelter for the night. Of course, I told him he was welcome, and bade him be at home. After tea the storm came on, and it was a wild night. The winter winds were fearful to hear. We chatted pleasantly, until the stranger complained of fatigue, when I had a room prepared, and he retired. We all- soon followed. I had been in bed I know not how long, when my door was opened and a figure entered. It approached the fire-place, and I saw-the Stranger. I thought he must have walked in his sleep, and was about to call to him, when his movements indicated that he was awake. He had a long knife in -his hand, the blade of which flashed in the fire-light. He came to my bed-side, raised the knife, and felt for my heart. I seemed under a spell, and could not cry out; but closed my eyes for death. A blow-a sharp pain-and I awoke in exces- sive fright-great drops of sweat attesting the agony of my mind.' "Why, father," said Lilly, cheerily; "I often have wild, fearful dreams; let us eat, and think no more about it." "I do not place credence at all in dreams,' answered he; ,' and yet I cannot at once release my mind from this vision, so terribly distinct was it." They adjourned s   .. THE STRANGER.      215 to the drawing-room and spent the morning in their usual employments. 'Mr. Mason had resided in the mansion since his mar- riage, some twenty years previously. His wife, a deli- cate woman, was not long spared to cheer his home; and after her death he devoted his time more zealously to the wants of his daughter. Lilly was of that pleasing style of beauty which never -fades. Light and graceful, of a good figure, handsome features, with dark eyes and hair;--she was the belle of the valley. Kindness beamed forth in her expressive countenance, whilst innate modesty lent a charm to crown it all.  '       -   , The love between father and child amounted almost to idolatry. Lilly loved him with a tender and deep affection, which constantly manifested "itself in ener- getic efforts to please, and promote his comfort and happiness. He, on the other hand worshipped his gentle child; administered to her every wish, and spared no pains to make her days all sunshine and joy. Her education was duty cared for, and'the higher accom- plishments not forgotten. Mr. Mason was amply sup- plied with this world's goods, and lived at his ease in I his beautiful home. \A  &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC8357-00000111"/> 216       THE STRANGER, CHAPTER III. WBEN Mr. Mason moved tol Ridge 'Hall with his peerless bride, he took with him, as -a waiting maid, a young woman, who had been an esteemed servant in his father's family. She kad been married during that time, and was a widow, with a bright-eyed boy, a child of about four, when Mr. Mason took her into his ser- vice. The child was rather pretty, and his affectionate disposition soon won as a firm friend the proprietor of Ridge Hall-for so the mansion was called. 'When he was about ten years old his-mother sickened and died, with the assurance that her boy would be. duly care'd for. Accordingly, Wilfred was taken into the family, and adopted as Mr. Mason's son. Wilfred at this age evinced a- desire for study, which'was exceed- ingly pleasing to his foster father. He was instructed in all the learning of the day, and, with Lilly, enjoyed an equal opportunity to acquire the higher accomplish- ments of mind and person. The constant familiar intercourse between Wilfred mnd Lilly, at study, and during recreation, tended to iwaken a deep friendship; and, indeed, as years passed. n, they found an affection springing up in their hearts, which speedily developed into love. Lilly had not been   THE STRANGER.        217 reared with aristocratic notions of noble blood and birth, nor was she taught to consider virtuous poverty beneath her, and when Wilfred declared his love for her, she confessed a like feeling for. him ; a mutual understhnd- ing was had, and they were happy in their new joy, although without Mr. Mason being aware of the exist- ing state of affairs. Wilfred's disposition had changed greatly, after pass- ing his eighteenth year. He became fond of an easy, careless life, and at times was inclined to be morose and sullen, which, with a proud nature, rendered him obnoxious to those subject to his will. He seemed, too, to forget his position in the household, and exacted servitude to his whims that ill became him.' He manifested no particular love for his kind bene- factor, although he treated him with marked respect. Such was the state of matters, some  three years previous to the night which ushers in our story. Mr. Mason admitted Wilfred into his business affairs with great confidence, and often called upon him to assist in his financial matters. A   change was ever after perceptible in his manner. He became thoughtful, and inclined to solitude, as though-,revolving some plan of great moment in his mind. He was discontented at all times. Lillyand -her father noticed the change, and whilst the former re. doubled her efforts to chose away his gloom, the latter-  .'  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC8357-00000112"/> 218       THE STRANGER. conjectured that he was weary of his dull life in the country, and wished for a relief, and the old gentleman pondered and planned to the intent that he might find a way to obtain the desired end. At length he deter- mined to send Wilfred away from Ridge Hall for a season, and resolving to speak to him. in the morning, he- dismissed further consideration of the matter until then. After breakfast next morning, Mr. Mason desiring Wilfred to appear in the library, repaired thither. Shortly after, Wilfred entered, and, taking a seat, pre- pared to listen.- "Wilfred," said the old Igentleman; " 1 wish to talk plainly to you about a matter concerning your own interest, and desire your views on the subject." Wilfred started, but remained silent. "I have observed a growing restlessness in your disposition for many months, and supposed you were becoming tired of your present life. How is it, boy?" Wilfred nodded an affirmative. ,Well," resumed his foster-father; 'I have con- sidered about it, and have concluded to offer you a change. What say you?" "You are the judge," returned Wilfred -gloomily; it is not well that I should suggest anything." "Nay, boy, not so; you know I have always treated you as my own child; nothing has been withheld that -.  .                . t   THE STRANGER&amp;       219 could add to your comfort or pleasure. I have con- sulted your opinion in many important business affairs, and cannot see why you should answer in that strain, I merely thought to afford -you an opportunity to see other places and new faces, to relieve the dull routine of country life, in fact, you are old enough to be think- ing of choosing some position, where you could benefit yourself, and give your powers of mind due expansion, and this too has hastened my desire that you should enter the arena of business, and acquire a knowledge of mercantile life, in order that you may have a standby in after years. I have a friend-a merchant in H-, who is a thoroughly practical man, and he will give you a situation in his establishment if you wish.  It only remains for you to say if this accords with your desires." "It-matters little," returned WilfreAd, carelessly; " I shall be glad to avail myself of your kind forethought. It is true, you have been indulging moeto such a degree that I had well nigh forgotten that I should be up and doing for myself; but I will at once retriqve my error by immediately preparing for my journey to P-- . With your permission I will withdraw and-" "Stop, sir!" said Mr. Mason, "do not be in too great haste.

Going to his room, he closed the door, and threw himself into a chair, where he remained motionless for some time; then, starting up, he paced the floor with hurried steps,- ever and anon giving vent to his feelings in expressions of anger. "The old fool, to thus destroy all my plans for the future by one fell blow. Of course, he is only seeking my happiness--promoting my interest. Ah! I know better than that. He has in- some way learned of my love for his daughter, and not wishing such an alliance, he chooses to send me away, and so quietly end the matter. He will then teach her to forget me, the low- born, and finally marry her to some gentleman of noble lineage and wealth; whilst I am toiling unthought of, hundreds of miles away. And then, too, to -be so solicitous about my welfare, as to occasion himself much thought and worriment of mind, and close his remarks by offering ,me a choice in the matter, when his own arrangements and language admitted of none. "Bah! I hate deceit; why not tell me plainly he was supporting me:--that I should earn my own bread? But 'tis done, and I'll not weep, nor yet object; but for the present, yield implicit obedience to all his wishes. Who knows what the future may unfold for   THE STRANGER,        221 me? Ah! there is Lilly calling me, and I will go to acquaint her with this new idea." Smoothing his ruffled temper and brow, he descended to the drawing-room, where Lilly awaited his coming. "Do you know, little one," he said smiling, ' the result of the council of two held this day in the library?" "What council, Wilfred?" "Ah! true enough; you didn't know there was to be a council. - You heard your father request my pre- sence there, did you not?" '"Why, yes; I recollect now, he did say something at breakfast about your meeting him there; but I'sup, posed only to assist him with business. What was it?" "He wished-to talk with me concerning my future, life; and the result is simply this: He is of the opinion that I had better become acquainted with some business, to afford me a means of honorable sup- port, as-he doubtless thinks I have too long been X useless burden upon his hands, and therefore he pros poses, and in fact, has decided, that I shall go to P   , and enter the establishment of a Mr. Sindson, merchant, and acquire a knowledge of mercantile life." "Indeed! why father has not mentioned, or even hinted this to -me." "Doubtless not. You dull-to-comprehend, do you not see his idea?

He is aware that it requires two to carry on a matter of this kind, and acting on that knowledge, he means to send me far away for a long season, and trust to time to obliterate all traces of love from your heart. This he will do under pretence of seeking to advance my wel- fare. Consider-this as I have done, and you will see why your father has not made you acquainted with the matter. He fears you will object, and desire him to allow me to remain-which, however, I would not do now, after giving my acquiescence to his wishes." "I am sorry, very sorry you are going from me; but, Wilfred, you are certainly doing father great injustice in attributing his purposes to his own selfish views. You are mistaken in thinking as you do, and entertaining for a single moment such suspicions in regard to his kindly-offered assistance to advance you to a position whereby you may acquire wealth and position in a very few years. You would have me to think my father would do you an injury, when all his efforts have been directed with a view to make you forget all- else save that you are to him as a son. Although deeply regretting that we must separate, even for' a brief season, I cannot bear to have you think as you do, feeling confident you have placed a i     THEI STRANGER.       223 wrong construction upon his motives. Father assur- edly is best able to judge what is for your benefit, and the separation need not be for a great while, you know, and in the interim we can correspond frequently, and I may some day find a favorable opportunity to inform him of our love, and solicit his consent to our union immediately on your return. Your cheerful accept- ance of his proffer may be a stepping-stone to win him over, should he at all object, which I have no reason to fear he will. But when do you start?" "In about three weeks; and in the meantime, I shall be much engaged, so you will excuse any appa- rent neglect," said he hastily, for he was angry with his gentle partner because she did not think as he did, and for attempting to argue that he was wrong. He returned to his room in no better iood than before, and during the intervening three weeks was not so often with Lilly as previously. Lilly really loved Wilfred, andf was saddened when she thought they must be separated at all; but her perfect confidence in 'her father, and her pure affection for him, induced her willing and silent sacrifice of self-interest.  &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC8357-00000115"/> 224       -THE STRANGER. CHAPTER IV. TEE day for Wilfred's departure arrived. In the morning-early, he and Lilly were together a long time, conversing of the future-its hopes and fears, and in: perfecting plans for the interim. Wilfred seemed to have forgotten his pique, and was all sunshine and activity. The family carriage, which was to convey them as far as Waterbrook, being brought to the door, he sprang lightly in after Mr. Mason, and leaning from the window, recived a farewell kiss, and the next moment was gone. Lilly missed Wilfred greatly; but with a light heart, she preferred to enjoy the present, and have it glide away swiftly, instead of weeping for the past, or vainly wishing for the future to hasten. She pursued her studies with renewed diligence, and sought employment for her leisure hours, in assisting good dame Marlin, the busy house-keeper. Mr. Mason 'and Wilfred arrived at Waterbrook without accident or delay, and here they parted; the former giving Wilfred much useful advice. He pro- vided him with a well-filled purse for present neces- sities, and requested him th write often, and not scruple at any time to ask of him any favor, pecuniarily or otherwise. With many kind wishes for his safety,   THE STRANGER.        225 success, and happiness, he bade him adieu, and next day returned to Ridge Hall. Lilly was now her father's -exclusive company, and proved a worthy companion; for her filial love prompted her to make his lonely hours pass joy- ously and quickly.  She never wearied of attend- ing him, and anticipating his every wish, always talk- ing cheerfully, and diverting his thoughts-from sad- ness or despondency. She was really a very sunbeam in the old man's home. There were several servants, male and female, con- nected with the. Hall; the family numbering eight, all told. Ridge Hall was situated on the ferry-road, about ten miles north of the river, in a nook of the eastern range of mountains, and surrounded by natural scenery, of great beauty.  The spurs of the Laurel Ridge, in the rear of the mansion, rose majestically towards Heaven, bearing upon their rough bosoms vast forests of luxuriant trees. A deep creek, narrow and winding, ran past the right of the house, and from the front porch was visible a splendid cascade of silvery waters, dancing in the rich sunlight, as they leaped from rock to rock. A fine valley extended as far as the eye could reach, on either side ; and in front, the opposite range of the Chestnut Ridge, loomed up darkly in the distance. The grounds, too, were attractive, being excellently  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC8357-00000116"/> 22  -     THE STRANGER. cultivated, and filled with rare plants and choic exotics. It was a pleasant spot, and the home O taste and refinement. Mr. Mason was originally fron England. His father had much wealth, and upon hi, son's arriving of age, gave him a goodly portion foi himself. Lillyr was Mr. Mason's only child; and as, we have seen, was his idol. Losing her mother at a tender age, she clung to her remaining parent with double love. There were few neighbors to Ridge Hall; but they visited Mr. Mason, and held him in high esteem as a gentleman of worth and talent. Amongst others, a Mr. Hunter and his two grown sons, were frequently at the hall to spend a social evening. They valued the information to be gained from the conversation of their host, which was at all times instructive. Time sped on, and four years had gone to join the vast ages of the fading past. Wilfred had occasion- ally written, buf for over a year they of Ridge Hall knew naught of their protege. Wilfred, after parting from Mr. Mason, met with no mishap; and after due time we find him in P---. He   waited upon Mr. Sindson the next day, and received a cordial welcome from that gentleman, who at once gave him an eligible position in his business. For a  while he devoted much attention to his employ-   THE STRANGER.        227 er's interest and his own; but unfortunately, making the acquaintance of idle men, he spent so much time in their company as to seriously affect his capacity for discharging his duties faithfully. After a six months trial, Mr. Sindson deemed it advisable to be without him; and thus, left to follow his own inclinations, but a little time served to make him an eager worshipper at the shrine of folly and crime. He needed money to continue this life, anrd his purse being empty, he had recourse to gambling to replenish it. Losing from time to time more than he could win, -he was constantly in debt. One night he borrowed a large sum from a companion in iniquity, and staking all on the hazard of a single die--he lost, and rushed -from the place almost a madman. He had hoped to-win, and thus retrieve his fallen fortunes; but imagine his anguish at this termination. He -passed a wakeful night, and in the morning sought his friend, and told him he would be absent a few weeks, and upon his return would repay him for his kindness.  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC8357-00000117"/> 228  ,     THE STRANGER. CHAPTER V. Ir our readers will remember, the beginning of the second chapter, left Lilly and her father occupied with their usual morning duties. The morning was cheerless and cold, and the sky dull. and heavy. In the after part of the day the atmosphere became hazy, and towards sunset huge masses of black clouds appeared above the mountain-top, whilst wintry winds began a mournful song, a requiem to the fading light. Mr. Mason, apprehending a storm, transacted all his outside business early; and at dark was seated with Lilly in the drawing-room; A bright fire cast its ruddy light over the room, where the servants were arranging the supper, which had been ordered there. "Listen, father!" said Lilly," " do hear the wind- what a fearful noise it makes.  Indeed it almost frightens me, even near you, with such a storm gathering," "Yes, daughter! 'twill be a terrible night; and I pity the poor wayfarer who must brave it." "Oh! I do hope there will be no- one exposed to its violence," said Lilly, shuddering. "A  night like this renders our homes doubly dear to us. What reason we have to thank God that we -have so comfortable a shelter from the inclement blast. low   THE STRANGER.  .      229 I wonder where Wilfred is to-night; poor boy, I should like to--" "A stranger, sir, desires to see you," said a ser- vant, opening the door. ' Show him in, Sammy!" said Mr. Mason, jump- ing up briskly. ':Ah, sir!" as a tall, well-dressed stranger entered; "glad to be able to afford you a shelter-pray draw near to the fire, and--" here, Sammy, my boy! take the gentleman's wet gar- ments and place thdm to dry. Just in time, sir, to unite with us at the evening meal," continued the host, his noble heart warming towards the storm- stayed traveler. "I'll warrant you're hungry--rid- ing.-draw up, Sir, and make yourself at home." Thus cordially invited, the stranger did justice to the supper.          - It was now that Mr. Mason and Lilly had' an oppor- tunity to observe their guest. He was intent, or seemed so, upon his meal, and did not talk much. He appeared to be a man of thirty-five years, tall, well- formed and graceful in his movements, wore black whiskers all around his face, and had black curly hair. After the repast was ended, he was disposed to be pleasant, and related how that he was journeying southward, when the tempest came upon him, and that he had been lured to their hospitable home by the light from the windows. Complaining of fatigue, he was 20  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC8357-00000118"/> 230       THE STRANGER. early conducted to his room, and bade his host good night. Soon after Mr. Mason retired, and the family were speedily in the land of dreams. The stranger, on being left alone, drew aside the curtain, and looked out into the night. - 'A rough ride, I'll have of it," he muttered, and shivering with the thought, he turned to the fire and sat down. An hour after he arose silently, took- his way down the rear staircase, opened the hall door, and was presently standing within the stable. He was strangely familiar with the house and grounds, going from place to place with ease. His horse was soon saddled, and leading him to the side door facing the south, he fastened him. Returning to the back door, he re-entered the house, unlocked the side door, and again stood within his room. Finding all quiet, he slipped lightly across the entry to the door of Mr. Mason's chamber. The lat- ter gentleman was now enjoying the sleep that con- scious innocence brings to the weary. He had not forgotten his dream, but the pursuits of the day, and the lively conversation of the evening, had, in a mea- sure relieved his thoughts of their ominous burden, and he sought his couch with a feeling of security that banished fear. The stranger tried the door, and find- ing it unlocked, opened it softly and -entered. He went to the fire-place, listened a moment, and then unicovered the live coals from their ashy nest. Profit-   THE STRANGER.        231 ing by the brief light thus afforded, he approached a small closet in the corner of the room, pressed a hid- den spring, and the door flew back. Removing a drawer from the case thus disclosed, he placed his hand in the space, and produced a box in which he found a singularly shaped key; which he seized ner- vously. Replacing the drawer and closing the closet, he knelt by the iron-bound box, and applying the key the lock yielded to the pressure. Lifting the lid, the gold was within his reach. He took the key from the lock and placed it in his pocket, then cautiously lift- ing several bags of the precious metal, he bore them down the stairs, out the side door, and deposited them in the saddle-bags on his horse. All this -was done in a very few minutes. Again he knelt by the strong box, and removed two purses well filled. This done, he commenced a search as if for some object of importance, (for he seemed to know what was in the room and in the box.) Whilst thus engaged, the light from the fire grew dim; and rising, he again stirred the coals and returned to the search; but the room being but dimly seen in the glare from the fire, he struck against a low stool that had escaped his notice, and. stumbling, knocked the heavy lid of the box, which fell with a sharp clang that sounded loud through the house. Mr. Mason, awakened by the noise, sprang from his bed, and naturally ignorant of the cause, was pro- A  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC8357-00000119"/> 232.       THE STRANGER. ceeding to strike a light, when a movement of the rob- ber revealed his figure to the- bewildered man, who immediately called for help. The robber caught him by the throat and sternly bade him cease -his cries, or he would kill him. Mr. Mason, being excited, grap- pled with the man, and still called lustily for assist- ance. His cries were attracting attention in the house, as the various noises attested. The stranger had evidently only intended a rob- bery, for he now endeavored to cast off the grasp of the thoroughly awakened old gentleman, with a view to escape; but the latter only tightened his hold, and shouted " murder! help! help!" at the top of his voice. Hurried footsteps were- heard in the room above, and a door was opened. The stranger found the old man was likely to hinder, if not prevent his exit, and maddened by the efforts to make him a pri- soner, he drew a knife and struck Mr. Mason in the back. The latter released his hold with a wild cry of pain, and the; stranger sprang to the door just as the two servants entered. Doubling his hand he dealt the foremost a blow, which staggered him, and rush- on tumbled the other over, and jumping over him and down the stairs, mounted his horse and rode off. On emerging from the gate, he turned his horse's head southward towards the ferry. He had two-reasons for so doing. The one was, that any pursuers would first -   THE STRANGER.        233 suppose that he would go as he came, which was north- ward(, towards P---- affording some chance to escape across the open country. The other was, that as the south road was intercepted by the river ten miles below, they would think no man would dare venture the ferry on such a night. Dashing on despite the war of the elements around him, and the piercing cold; he-soon came within hearing of the roaring stream, and a 'moment afterward drew rein in front of the ferry house. Dismounting and keeping hold of his horse, he summoned the old ferryman; a s we have seen in the beginning of the story, for the man whom we met then, and the stranger, were one and the same- person. The stranger had just escaped in time, for the whole house was aroused, and all ran to Mr. Mason's room. The one servant had speedily regained lhis feet, and flew to the assistance of his fallen master, who was lying moaning on the floor. The other had been knocked senseless, and was conveyed away. Mr. Mason was badly wounded, but recovered sufficiently in a little while, to give a brief account of the matter and to send for- Mr. Hunter and his sons. They hastened to his bedside and only waited to hear from the house- keeper a brief description of the stranger, and the route he came, and then rode rapidly away to the north, feeling sure that if the fugitive had taken the other road, he could not escape that night.

He examined the wound and pronounced it dangerous, but not mortal; which announcement was hailed with unfeigned demonstrations of joy by the household. Lilly had fainted upon seeing her father prostrate on the floor with the blood flowing from his back, and was borne away unconscious. Upon regaining her senses, she commenced a spell of passionate weeping, and would not believe but that he was dead. The kind 'house-keeper had much difficulty to convince her to the contrary, and then to prevent her from going to him, which, in her excited condition, would have had a serious effect upon his weakened system. She hap- pily saw the sense of the reasoning, and allowed her- self to be persuaded upon, and remained quiet until the surgeon arrived. An hour after, his opinion relieved her suspense, and she at once became calm, and was permitted to see and wait upon her father. Order being restored, the servants retired, and the house again becaie silent, save the low tread of the nurse and the whispers of the watchers.   THE STRANGER.        '235 CHAPTER VI. I,    AT breakfast, the Hunters returned, having failed to see or hear of the fugitive; although other neigh- bors had been aroused and assisted to seek for him. After breakfast, they searched the country towards the south, and arriving at the ferry-house, were told of the occurrences of the night, and received the key the stranger had dropped, which was the key to the strong box. They thus found a clue to the direction taken -by the robber; but had the mortification to learn that they had lost him, for having a few hours start, he was then, doubtless, in a place of safety. Mr. Mason, with good nursing, attention and quiet- ness, recovered from the effects of his wound-; but his system had received a severe shock, ands he was never again so strong-- as before. Months passed, the excitement subsided, and the robbery and almost murder ceased to afford subject for further conversation. Affairs moved on as of old at Ridge Hall, and the summer was declining; when, one day, word was brought to Mr. Mason that a man in? k who was confined in prison for murder, de- sired to see him -and his daughter; as he had not long to live. Mr. Mason- determined to go to him, having a dread presentiment that the murderer was Wilfred, his foster son.  f   &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC8357-00000121"/> 236       THE STRANGER. In a few days, being ready to commence the journey, Mr. Mason told the house-keeper when to expect them back, and also gave orders to have the saddle horses in waiting at Stanton, on the lower ferry-road, as they would return that way; he wishing to visit an esteemed friend living there whom he had not seen for many years. They then set out, and arrived at? in due time. Upon calling at the prison, they were admitted to the cell of the condemned, and found the guilty criminal to be Wilfred-sure enough. Disease was doing its work. Consumption was fast bearing him to the grave. He bade them be seated, and then gave vent to his feelings in a flood of bitter tears. Remorse was eating at his heart's core, and the merciless thoughts of the past were leaving scathing wounds upon his soul. He was deeply conscious of his wickedness, and was humbly seeking pardon from an offended God. He said he had heard of the attack on Mr. Mason's life, and asked him if he had ever heard of the robber.  Upon his replying in the negative, Wilfred told them to look upon the being before them-and behold the man.. They were astonished, and supposed- his mind was wandering; but he, began and narrated his history from the hour of parting from Mr. Mason at Waterbrook, and assured them that it was he, who had robbed and nearly killed him, after being so kindly 9    Y   THE STRANGER.       237 received and entertained. He said he had not intended murder-only to possess himself of the gold--make his escape, and return to? to continue his career of. crime. Fearful of being caught and recognized then, he had recourse to force to release himself from the grasp of his foster father. He had succeeded in pass- ing the river (as we saw elsewhere,) traveled until dawn, and finding he was not pursued, stopped at an inn to rest, and upon resuming his journey, arrived art P without accident. Here he had squandered his ill. gotten wealth, and having quarrelled one night with a companion at a gambling house, he had- stabbed and killed him, was arrested, tried, and condemned, to, expiate his crime on the gallows. But disease was doing the work instead, and feeling that his days were numbered, he had sent for them, to explain, express his sorrow for the transaction, and implore their for- giveness. The latter was freely given, and the gentle maiden wept over his untimely fate. Finding they could be of no service there, and that their pre- sence was only increasing his misery, they departed, after bidding him a final adieu. Soon after, they set out to return.- A few days were spent in Stanton, and then mounting their horses they continued their homeward ride; reaching the ferry towards nightfall. During thejourney across the river, Lilly was seated upon her horse, and her father stood, holding his  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC8357-00000122"/> 238       THE STRANGER. head to prevent accident. A move of the boat frighted- the other horse, and her father letting go his hold to catch him, struck the animal she was on. He, too, becoming restless, the ferry-man attempted to seize the bridle, when he sprang back over the stern into the water, carrying Lilly with him. Her father, in agony, reached out the boat pole, but she could not grasp it, and sunk.  Harry (the ferryman's son,) at once sprang in and succeeding in catching her dress, as she appeared the second time above water. It required but little effort to sustain her until the boat was backed to them, for Harry was strong and a good swimmer. She was speedily placed in her father's arms, and they hastened to the shore. The boat touched the land, and Lilly was carried-to the ferry-house. The ferryman's wife used every exertion to resuscitate her, and soon her labor was rewarded with success. Lilly opened her eyes, and, recovering her breath, asked for her father. The old gentleman: nearly wild with joy, caught her to his :breast, and exclaimed, "Here I am, my daughter, thank God! oh, thank God!"    Lilly  was soon able to resume her journey, but they did not set out, until her father had gone and brought in Harry, who, blushing and stammering, said he had done nothing- to merit the thanks and blessings the old man was showering upon him. The, latter, however, kept shaking the young man's hand, and bade him ask   THE STRANGER.        239 what he would, he should have it. Harry refused any money or promise of wealth, but when,Lilly removed a plain gold ring from her finger, and offered it to him as her token of deep gratitude, he bowed low, and accepted it. The travelers were soon on their way towards home, each busied thinking of the accident- its nearly fatal result, and of the pleasant and rather handsome-son of the ferry-man. Upon arriving home, and after tea, they were discoursing upon the events of the past day, and the old gentleman said he was determined in some way to show his appreciation of the noble youth's service, and would not rest until he had done something to benefit him. A few days after, Harry called to ask how Miss Lilly was, after her 'fright. Mr. Mason bade him enter, and called his daughter to answer the question in person, which she did in such a pleasant manner as to place the young man entirely at his ease, and they talked together for an hour or more.  When he left it was-with the under- standing that he should come to Ridge Hall, and receive the benefit of a good education. Arrangements to this effect were made with his parents, who were glad to - have their son enjoy so great an advantage, and so Harry Sammer was speedily installed as one of the household. But little remains to be told ere we are done. Wilfred died in prison six months after the visit of Mr. Mason  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC8357-00000123"/> i 240       - THE STRANGER. and Lilly. He was penitent, and passed away from earth and pain, to the dread tribunal of the great Judge, with a fervent prayer for mercy. Mr. Mason had-exerted himsflf to procure his release, but in vain, and after his decease, he attended in person to his burial, :as a last token of affection. Harry continued at Ridge Hall, until he was unable to go away, without taking another with him, and as a third party objected to such a proceeding, he concluded to remain. In fact, Harry, as a natural consequence of enjoying the society of Lilly Mason, became a solicitor to have and forever hold that great privilege, in other words he sought her hand and heart in mar- riage. Lilly, too, found her affections, chastened by disappointment and sorrow, centring on him, and when he declared his love for her, and vowed she was absolutely necessary to his existence, she gave him the return-desired, and they, with the approbation of her father, were made one-joined in that holy union that God smiiles upon, and which makes life joyous. They, at Mr. Mason's request, continued their abode at "the Hall, to cheer and comfort his declining years. The old ferry-man rejoiced at the unexpected happy termination of/ affairs, foir many years continued to -transport travelers across the .river, and seldom failed to recount the story--of the night on the river and -the:stranger;.     ;  :-  .  . : , &#xD;</p>
