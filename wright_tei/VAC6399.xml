               <head type="sub">THE DEATH OF A PATRIARCH.</head> 
               <p>IT was a dismal October night! The wind moaned drearily round the old homestead, and penetrated every crevice of the spacious kitchen, causing the flame of the tallow candle,-which, in an iron candlestick, was suspended by a wooden rod from the low ceiling before the fire-to flicker with an unsteady glimmer.</p> 
               <p>As I sat on the form, in one comer of the capacious fire-place, and watched the huge brands smouldering to ashes, and listened to the night wind, and the low murmur from the adjoining bedroom, a feeling of loneliness and alarm crept over me, and with a shiver I sprang to my feet, glanced up the wide chimney, and around the familiar room, with that undefined dread, all sometimes experience.</p> 
               <p>Nothing uncanny met my sight. There were the sanded floor, white walls and dark wainscot of the large room, just as I had always remembered it, with the black claw-footed tables, flag-bottomed chairs, and long dresser; its loaded shelves now gleaming with an uncertain shimmer.</p> 
               <p>Above the high mantle hung the History of Joseph, delineated in twelve wonderfully designed and colored prints, in black frames; at their side depended the almanac and the tobacco trencher, with its store of clay pipes and New England-not Virginia-weed, for Grandsir, raised his own tobacco.</p> 
               <p>Grandma'am's low chair was at my side, and her spectacles and knitting-work lay on the round stand in the corner. Opposite, stood Grandsir's large arm chair with its "Job's trouble," woollen patchwork cushion. As I glared to this chair my eyes filled, and, with a subdued sob, I sank back on my seat, for that very day the dear old man had seated himself there after the noonday meal, and with the white locks falling over his calm, pale face, had sunk into at what first was supposed to be his after-dinner nap, but soon it was discovered to be stupor, the precursor of that slumber from which comes no earthly awakening.</p> 
               <p>For a time, I wept hysterically; how could I bear this my first great grief? I must see my grandfather! What was this death, this mysterious messenger? Stifling my sobs, I quietly opened a door by the fire-place and entered the bedroom. It looked eerie in the dim light which cast weird shadows upon the walls, and left the bed, with its dark green moreen hangings, in obscurity.</p> 
               <pb n="2-3" xml:id="VAC6399-00000003"/> 
               <p>The lofty case of drawers loomed up black and gigantic, and the uncouth figures in the picture over the chimney-piece u Of England's Glory in the issue of his late Royal Highness Frederick, Prince of Wales," stood out more grim and ghastly than ever. All this, with the solemn stillness in which the tall clock, in a corner of the kitchen, could be distinctly heard, completely overawed me, and with a quickly beating heart I crept to cousin Ruthy, who, seated upon Grandsir's blue chest, was swaying herself to and fro, and weeping silently.</p> 
               <p>Grandma'am sat at the bed's head, quietly wiping the tears that rolled slowly over her wrinkled cheeks. Doctor Evans was seated at the other side, and Parson Noles occupied a chair at the foot.</p> 
               <p>Sitting and standing around the room, were my uncles and aunts, and a few neighbors, who had come to sympathize and assist in the house of death. After a while I gained courage to leave Ruthy's side, and edge gradually towards the bed. The kind doctor stretched forth his hand and placed me on his knee. There lay my dear grandfather, with his beautiful white locks scattered over the pillow, and his finely-moulded face turned towards mine. Slowly the eyes opened, then closed-a tranquil smile flitted over the features-a slight shiver-and all was over. The lamp that had been gradually growing dimmer and dimmer, had now gone out on earth to shine with renewed brilliance in the celestial land.</p> 
               <p>There was a moment's silence, then Parson Noles supported Grandma'am from the room, the doctor took my hand, and accompanied by Ruthy, whose grief now broke forth in loud sobs, we returned to the kitchen; the others followed.</p> 
               <p>Parson Noles requested me to bring him the Bible. I stepped into a chair beside the oaken desk, and took the large volume from its top, but overcome by the thought that Grandsir would never read it more at morning and evening worship, one of our kind neighbors was obliged to come to my assistance.</p> 
               <p>A new candle had been placed in the candlestick, the stand was drawn under it, and the Bible laid thereon; the fire having been replenished, the company seated themselves, and reverently listened, as the clergyman read: "That the strong man should bow himself, that the grasshopper should become a burthen, and desire fail, because man goeth to his long home. Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern. Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was, and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it."</p> 
               <p>There were low sobs, as all rose, and with bowed heads joined in the fervent out-pouring to the All-wise and All-merciful Ruler, who, in his good providence, had seen fit thus suddenly to call home his aged servant. Thanks were given that his passage into another world had been so easy and brief, blessings were invoked upon Grandmother, the family, and the church and town which had now lost one of its oldest and most prominent members; finally an earnest wish was expressed, that all might at length be united above.</p> 
               <p>The minister and doctor soon took leave, and I went to bed, but sleep was impossible. For a time, I listened to the suppressed voices in the chamber of death; at length these ceased, the house became quiet, Ruthy joined me and I fell asleep.</p> 
               <p>About midnight, I was awakened by some sound caused by the watchers below, and lay for a time listening to the mournful sighing of the wind through the orange pear-tree by the window. Suddenly I found myself wandering with Ruthy through a large and magnificent building. I led the way from room to room, and at length opened the door of a spacious apartment full of people. My cousin with a terrified look motioned me away, but with great satisfaction I pushed aside the door, and stood upon the threshold.</p> 
               <p>Before me sat the peaked-bearded, sable-cloaked and steeple-hatted ancestor, who, with a few brave companions, had first settled on the banks of the winding Quascacunquen. Near him, tall and stately, stood the Mistress Alice, his high-born and delicately bred wife, who, for conscience sake, courageously left her pleasant English home for a log hut in the unbroken wilderness.</p> 
               <p>Next came the stern Puritan, who pushing still farther on, had set up his hearth-stone beside the beautiful Merrimac.</p> 
               <p>Beyond, were more immediate progenitors, and at the upper end of the room stood Grandsir, with the parents that I had never known, by his side.</p> 
               <p>I sprang towards them, and was locked in that embrace for which my heart had always yearned.</p> 
               <p>With words of counsel and cheer, the vision passed. Was this a phantom of the brain, or was the impression I then received, which has accompanied me through life, and often been a guide and landmark, a revelation of spirit to spirit, a communion in which earth had no part?</p> 
               <p>A bright autumn sun was shining through the blue-checked curtains when I awoke, calm and refreshed.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER II.</head> 
               <head type="sub">A FUNERAL IN THE OLDEN TIMES.</head> 
               <p>AN unusual bustle pervaded the house. Upon entering the kitchen, I found that my two aunts, who had been summoned the previous afternoon from the neighboring town were about to return, accompanied by our neighbor, Mrs. Prime. These, with Grandma'am, and Ruthy, were grouped around the large table between the front windows, upon which several articles of mourning were displayed. There was evidently a grave discussion going on, and with some fear that I should be deemed an intruder, I sidled towards the group. As I passed the end window, I saw that Mr. Prime was harnessing our Dobbin into the new square-top chaise, that Grandsir never used excepting Sundays, and other extra occasions.</p> 
               <p>Approaching the table I found Ruthy was making a list of articles, which Mrs. Prime was commissioned to purchase.</p> 
               <p>After much conversation, in a solemn half whisper, matters were concluded, and the chaise brought to the door. With many last words, and especial directions from Ruthy to get everything in the newest style, they drove away.</p> 
               <p>Aunt Nabby and Cousin Judy now came in, and in a few moments Uncle John brought Miss Lane, the mantua-maker. Ruthy bade me eat my breakfast, and another council was held respecting the farther preparations.</p> 
               <p>Numerous jugs, bottles, buckets and boxes, were drawn from the dresser, cupboards, and placed in Uncle John's cart, and after much confusion and clatter, he also started for "Port."</p> 
               <p>A black silk dress, that had been my mother's, was brought forth, and, as after examination, it was decided that it would cut over nicely for me, and look as well as new, Miss Lane commenced her work.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Prime returned in a few hours, and several other neighboring women came in to sew in the afternoon. If it had not been for the solemn faces and half-whispered tones, I believe I should<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC6399-00000004"/> have forgotten my loss in this unusual commotion; but at night, when all was still, the empty chair and shadowy room brought the reality vividly to view and I stole into the bedroom to gaze upon the dear features, so placid in their last repose.</p> 
               <p>As I stood there, recalling the simple earnest character of the departed, the question came, would he approve of the manner in which the day had been spent. I was conscious that I never before had been so engrossed by fashion and like worldly matters, and I felt condemned. I was too young to analyze these feelings, but was sure that Grandsir would disapprove of unnecessary parade, and that I ought not to be proud because I was to wear my dead mother's silk gown at his funeral.</p> 
               <p>The next morning, the seamstresses were again busily at work. The red oven lids were taken down, and the great and little ovens put to heating. Then began such a concoction of bread, pies, and cake, as I never had witnessed excepting at Thanksgiving.</p> 
               <p>The house was in confusion during the day, and till late at night. In the evening, the coffin was brought, and the body prepared for its final resting place. This made me very sad; tired, with a heavy heart, I went to bed, and sobbed myself to sleep.</p> 
               <p>The morrow having been appointed for the funeral, more help came, and the bustle increased.</p> 
               <p>I was told to dust the "fore-room." With a feeling of shame, I obeyed. I had not entered this grand apartment since the annual catechising, and the thought of the mortification I then endured now brought the warm blood to my cheeks.</p> 
               <p>Knowing my weak point, and fearing disgrace, I had studied with unwonted diligence, and the very morning of the day set for the examination had repeated the whole Westminster's form to Grandsir; but when the hour arrived, the grandeur of the preparations, and unusual elegance of dress, the children gathered from all parts of the district, standing in a row, the majestic solemnity of the clergyman, seated opposite in the great arm-chair, and the dignified gravity of my grandparents, quite overcame me, and when my turn came, not one word could I remember, could not even tell "What was the chief end of man?" Where my wits went I know not, but my brain reeled and eyesight failed, much to the chagrin of the family, and my ignominy. Ruthy was obliged to lead me from the room. Now the spacious apartment presented its usual prim appearance. The high bow-backed chairs kept sentry round the walls, the massive table, with curiously carved and twisted legs, stood beneath the antique mahogany framed looking-glass, the round tea-table presented its polished surface in one corner, the buffet, with its display of china, glass, and plate occupied another. Having dusted the furniture, and drawn the freshly strown sand upon the floor into a herring-bone pattern with the broom, I lingered to examine two holders that hung either side of the wide chimney. One displayed a colored woman, holding a tea-tray, the other, a boy bearing a tea-kettle. They had been the handiwork of my mother, and were considered chef-d'uvres of needlework.</p> 
               <p>The relatives from a distance now began to arrive. Mrs. Prime called me to turn the spit, which rested on brackets attached to the tall andirons, while she basted the beef with a long-handled butter-ladle, the drippings being received in the pan beneath.</p> 
               <p>The table having been set and the viands ready, I was directed to tell Uncle Jerry to draw a mug of cider. Uncle Jerry, as he was familiarly termed, was a rather simple man, who lived at a little hamlet in the woods, beyond the pond. Being honest and faithful, he was often employed about the farm.</p> 
               <p>I found him seated on the barn-floor on an inverted bushel measure. Having told my errand, I was surprised at being obliged to reiterate it. This only elicited a solemn shake of the head, and growing impatient, with a smart slap upon his shoulder, I demanded why he did not come along.</p> 
               <p>"I'se je ready when je rest is," mumbled forth the old man, with thick utterance. It was evident that somehow he had got too much liquor. What should I do? this was too scandalous; what would Grandsir have said?</p> 
               <p>At this moment a tall, weather-brown woman bounced past. Catching Uncle Jerry by the arm, she brought him to his feet in a twinkling, while with a sound shake she asked him "What he meant by thus disgracing hisself, and at Deacon Lee's funeral, too? You ought to be put in the stocks!"</p> 
               <p>Turning to me, she added: "This comes of having so much liquor about. I told Ruthy to have an eye on the old feller when she was filling the case-bottles and decanters. He will take a drop if he can git it, and a leetle tips him over."</p> 
               <p>"I 'se je ready Molgy Pinn," whimpered Uncle Jerry. "Then come to the well; cold water will set ye straight agin." And with no gentle hand, Mrs. Finn dragged her other half to the old well-curb before the house, where an application was administered that would have rejoiced the heart of a modern hydropathist.</p> 
               <p>The old man soon came in, and with my help, the cider was procured, and the company summoned to dinner. It was not a time for feasting, and the meal was soon over.</p> 
               <p>The dishes having been washed, the kitchen was put in order for reception of the corpse, which was brought from the bedroom and placed on the large table in the centre of the room. The pall having been adjusted, the silver plate, bearing the name and age of the deceased, was screwed to the lid.</p> 
               <p>The bedroom was next arranged for the bearers. I assisted Ruthy to turn up the bed under the moreen hangings. Brandy, wine, and spirits, were placed upon the table beside the mourning gloves and scarfs, that were to be presented to the friends who were honored with this mournful duty.</p> 
               <p>Like refreshments having been put in the other rooms, I went up stairs. Miss Lane was setting a few last stitches as' I entered my chamber. Ruthy joined us, and, with a sigh of relief, the dressmaker handed her the completed garment.</p> 
               <p>With an odd mixture of gratification at my unwonted elegance, and sorrow for the cause of its sable hue, I donned my silken attire.</p> 
               <p>Miss Lane bustled round, declaring "we never looked so well in our lives; mourning was so becoming, and those were such loves of bonnets! But what is this, Ruthy?" she inquired, taking a band of crape from the bed.</p> 
               <p>"Cousin James' weed. Aunt Rut-ledge says he cannot arrive much before prayers, so I thought I would take care of the crape."</p> 
               <p>"You had better give it to Mrs. Prime, who has charge of the weeds," Miss Lane replied, as she turned Ruthy before the glass. With a glance of approval, my cousin replied, "that she preferred to attend to James' hat herself."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, indeed!" rejoined her companion, with a meaning smile. "Perhaps he would expect it"</p> 
               <p>With a conscious little toss of her head, that implied that it might be so, Ruthy drew down her veil and left the room.</p> 
               <pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6399-00000005"/> 
               <p>The subject of this conversation was a young man who had been reared in his grandfather's household. His father having died soon after his birth, his mother formed a second alliance, and moved to New Hampshire. This was at that time a great undertaking, and it was not deemed prudent to expose so young a child to the hardship of a new settlement. James was accordingly left with his grandfather, and the old gentleman would never permit his mother to claim him.</p> 
               <p>At sixteen, the youth entered Uncle Rutledge's store in the neighboring seaport town, but for the past two years he had been employed as supercargo in one of the vessels in which the enterprising merchant had an interest. This vessel had just returned from a European voyage. Though we were sorry that Grandsir should not have lived to bless this, his favorite grandson, we were truly rejoiced that he would be able to take his part in the last obsequies to one whom he had loved as a father.</p> 
               <p>My bonnet having been tied on, I joined my cousin, Mira Rutledge. Together, we went below to take a last look at that venerable face, so soon to be shut from us forever.</p> 
               <p>How could we leave it! People were beginning to assemble, and we were bidden to take our places with the chief mourners in the best chamber.</p> 
               <p>How distinctly that sable-clad company rises to recollection! Gradually, the apartment became filled, and I was conscious there was a crowd below, and through the window I saw the yard was full of vehicles, and groups of men and boys were scattered about, conversing with serious faces, in low, solemn tones.</p> 
               <p>Parson Noles came in with noiseless tread, and having shaken hands with my grandmother and other members of the family, seated himself in the centre of the room.</p> 
               <p>There was an expectant pause-the rumble of wheels broke the silence.</p> 
               <p>A fashionable chaise, drawn by a superb gray horse, dashed to the door, and a young man sprang out. Throwing the reins to an attendant, with a quick step he entered the house. A pause, while a hasty glance was taken of the dear face, then James came above; saluting grandmother and the mourning group, he took the chair placed for him by the fire. The funeral service now commenced-I have a confused recollection of a long harangue, in which my grandfather's noble character was faithfully delineated, and a still more lengthy prayer, through which I sobbed in a childish abandon of grief.</p> 
               <p>The service over, Mr. Prime proceeded to call out the mourners. Grandmother and the sons and daughters having gone, James, Ruthy, and I were called. Passing down the stairs and through the crowded passage, we entered the chaise, and wheeled into the line of procession. The porters stood at the head of the avenue, supporting the bier,-the black velvet pall swaying gently in the still autumn air. Flanking either side came the bearers, in their black gloves and crape scarfs.</p> 
               <p>It had been a cloudy morning, but at that moment the sun suddenly burst forth, irradiating an extensive prospect. For miles, the eye wandered over hill and vale, forest and meadow, tiny brooklet and wide lake, on to the boundless ocean. Clear and distinct, in the afternoon light, gleamed the spires and buildings of the neighboring sea port town, with the signal towers at the river's mouth, the sands of beach, island and distant headland, and the white sails of vessels. Across rose the brown meeting-house, around and below lay the scattered homesteads of the parish. Farther on, came more distant spires and villages, the whole bounded landward by rolling hills, with the blue tops of nigh mountains sharply defined against the gray horizon.</p> 
               <p>The porters moved slowly forward, and the mourning train followed,-a long line of vehicles, reaching over a quarter of a mile.</p> 
               <p>Cousin James had much trouble to restrain his mettled steed in the requisite measured pace. Not a word had been interchanged between the three occupants of the carriage, till, with a suppressed scream, Ruthy exclaimed, "The weed! Oh, Jessie, James hasn't his weed! How could I forget it; why did n't you remind me? Dear, dear, we can't send back, what shall I do?"</p> 
               <p>Glancing at my cousin's hat, I rather maliciously replied, "that the mistake was now past remedy, but that it was singular, after all her exertion, that one of the chief mourners should appear at the grave without a weed. I should not have thought it would have slipped your mind after what you told Miss Lane."</p> 
               <p>I was sharply commanded to hush.</p> 
               <p>I think the tone of this colloquy struck my cousin peculiarly. Turning, lie looked from one to the other, and replied, "that Ruthy need not grieve for the crape,-that mattered little as long as there was grief and loving memories in the heart. He was no stickler for outward ceremonial; while he would not diminish one iota of respect for the dead, he had often thought that fashion favored too much funeral display."</p> 
               <p>Here were my vague, intangible feelings clearly and appropriately defined I leaned forward and gazed at my cousin. He was much changed. The handsome youth had become the handsome man. My searching look drew his attention.</p> 
               <p>"Well, pet, what do you think of me? I scarcely knew you. Have you grown good as fast as you have tall?"</p> 
               <p>I sadly shook my head. James smiled, with a kiss declared "I looked anything but a hoary sinner"; and a silence ensued, broken only by Ruthy's moans "of what folks would say about that weed."</p> 
               <p>The procession now approached the bare, desolate burying-ground upon the hillside. No bell sounded a funeral knell, for the low, brown meeting-house did not boast of such an appendage, but slowly and solemnly, in tearful silence, the last rites were paid to the manes of the worthy and revered, dust was committed to dust, in the full belief that the spirit had returned to the God who gave it.</p> 
               <p>Lingeringly, with many tears, we returned to the chaise.</p> 
               <p>"This seems hard," said James, as the procession turned homewards, "but we must remember that our loss is Grandsir's great gain. It would have been an unspeakable comfort to have heard his dear voice again, but I am thankful to have arrived in season for this occasion. Providence orders all aright, and the dear old man may be still with us in our better moments, though unperceptible to mortal sense."</p> 
               <p>Could this be? I had revolved this question often the past few days, and now, sinking back in my seat, I continued in a reverie the remainder of the ride. I was aroused by a sudden halt. We were at home; either side of the gate stood the bearers, who, with doffed hats, saluted us as we passed.</p> 
               <p>As soon as she was within doors, Ruthy ran for the weed, which she immediately fastened on James' hat. As she had anticipated, its non-appearance at the grave, had been universally remarked, and she received a severe rebuke from her mother and Mrs. Prime for her carelessness.</p> 
               <p>The family assembled in the parlor to<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6399-00000006"/> listen to the reading of the will. There was an expectant hush, and the dignified importance of Squire Norton, as he broke the seals of the large document, impressed me with great awe.</p> 
               <p>I was unaccustomed to law papers, and the phraseology of the long will rendered it nearly unintelligible. I then thought, from the numerous legacies, that my Grandfather must have been immensely rich: now I know that he was only a fore-handed farmer. Several things puzzled me greatly,-one clause respecting Grandma'am, and items concerning myself, were beyond my comprehension. One thing alone, I clearly understood, this was that I was placed under my Cousin James' sole guardianship. He was to have undisputed sway over me and mine.</p> 
               <p>This gave me great satisfaction. James had always been like an elder brother, and I blessed Grandsir, in my heart, for his affectionate consideration. Full of this feeling, I turned towards the young man. His glance was fixed upon the floor,-a chill crept over my enthusiasm. Would he consider me a troublesome charge? I could not say. All at once, the irreparable loss I had sustained pressed its reality upon me. With a feeling of utter loneliness, I buried my face in my hands and wept silently.</p> 
               <p>The will having been read, tea was handed round. Soon after, the company began to disperse. In a short time, all had left but Uncle John and his wife, who lived near, and Aunt Su-key and Cousin James, who were to remain for the present, and the house resumed its usual Saturday evening quiet.</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER III.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE NEW GUARDIAN.</head> 
               <p>GRANDMA'AM, complaining of headache, retired to the bedroom. Uncle John and cousin James repaired to the fore-room. My aunts and Ruthy drew their chairs before the kitchen fire, and conversed in low tones. It was evident that my presence was a restraint. Overhearing, at my seat by the window, something about meddlesome Matty, and everything getting to Grandma'am's ears, I stole into the parlor. I felt that I was intruding there, but the fires had gone out above stairs and the night was chilly, so I crept forward and seated myself in a low chair by the chimney.</p> 
               <p>Uncle John and cousin James were seated before the fire. On the round table between them lay the little black trunk, in which all Grandsir's papers were deposited. They were both intently examining deeds, notes, etc., but as the clock struck eight, Uncle John rose with the remark, "that they would defer secular concerns till after the Sabbath," and wishing James goodnight, he called his wife from the next room, and immediately after they left for home. James placed the scattered papers in the box, then drawing the arm-chair before the fire, he leaned back, with closed eyes.</p> 
               <p>I felt unspeakably sad and lonely, but had no inclination to join my aunt and cousin, the murmur of whose voices fell faintly upon my ear. I wished much to ask my new protector a few questions, but pet as I had always been, I dared not now disturb his reverie. He seemed altogether too much of a stranger for familiarity, and I was watching the mouldering fire, with big tears rolling down my cheeks, when he suddenly exclaimed: "What a quiet girl you have become, Jessie. I saw you come in but you have been so still I had entirely forgotten your presence. I scarcely recognize my merry little girl in the tall, silent, embryo young lady I find in her stead. I see that I must form a new acquaintance. How do you like your new guardian? What is the matter; why these tears? Come, don't be foolish. Pet, come here and unbosom the trouble!"</p> 
               <p>With the utmost tenderness, he drew me towards him, and placed me on his knee, in the old familiar manner.</p> 
               <p>I hid my face on his shoulder and sobbed aloud, for this kindness opened wide the flood gates of grief and wounded pride.</p> 
               <p>"What is all this,-what has so grieved our darling?" he fondly inquired.</p> 
               <p>"I am in everybody's way; nobody wants me," I half pettishly replied.</p> 
               <p>"Nobody wants you? what do you mean?"</p> 
               <p>"Why, Grandma'am has no right here now, they say, and Aunt Rutledge said you would not want to be burthened with me, and they as good as turned me out of the other room awhile ago. Everything seems changed now Grandsir is gone."</p> 
               <p>"True, Jessie, one household is broken up; another will take its place, but this has passed away forever. This is a sad truth to us, Jessie, but we must be thankful that such a home was ours so long, and that we can retain the pleasant memories that must ever cling around this hearth-stone. Aunt Rutledge is mistaken; instead of regarding you as a troublesome charge, I accept the trust with pride and pleasure, thankful that my beloved grandparent should repose so much confidence in me as to intrust his pride and joy, the pet and solace of his old age to my care. With God's help and your own exertion, I hope to see you the woman he would wish you to be come."</p> 
               <p>I clasped my arms about my cousin's neck, and promised to become his little girl entirely.</p> 
               <p>He smiled, said I should be his great girl soon, and inquired if I was going to feel desolate and miserable, and fancy that no one cared for me any longer.</p> 
               <p>"No, I had been silly, but what was it about-Grandma'am?"</p> 
               <p>"You knew that this was Grandsir's second wife?"</p> 
               <p>"I had been told so, but without much heed." Thoughtfully, I returned, "but she has been like an own grandmother,"</p> 
               <p>"True, and we shall always love her as such; but when she married, an agreement was made in case that the wife outlived the husband, she should receive a certain portion of the estate instead of the usual widow's dower. She has no part of the real estate; Uncle John will take the house and farm. I believe Grandma'am intends to board with him. I suppose she will feel more at home here now than at her own farm, which she received from her first husband."</p> 
               <p>"Then I am to stay, too, of course. Grandma'am couldn't spare <emph>me</emph>."</p> 
               <p>James smiled. "Don't pronounce us cruel, Jessie, but both Grandma'am and I have decided upon a different home for you. Now, do not look so alarmed and grieved, you are not going far; only to the parsonage, to your Aunt Compton."</p> 
               <p>"To the parsonage, to my Aunt Compton!" I gasped. "Why, James, my Aunt Compton can scarcely endure my presence, I remind her so vividly of her dead daughter, and her other sorrows."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, she said she had been very weak, but that the Lord had renewed her strength."</p> 
               <p>I was almost too much surprised for words. Madam Compton, the late pastor's widow and my deceased father's aunt, had been the especial dread of my childhood, and the annual visit, which Grandsir had insisted I should<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6399-00000007"/> pay to her, had been the one horror of my blithesome infancy.</p> 
               <p>"Must I go,-was there no alternative?"</p> 
               <p>With much tenderness, James replied, that he wished me to see how I should like the parsonage. Madam Compton really desired my companionship; that he thought it best I should be separated from Ruthy and Aunt Nabby; in fine, he had a variety of reasons for feeling satisfied at the prospect of this new home for me, which I should understand and appreciate in the future.</p> 
               <p>As it was time for prayers, with a strong feeling of dissatisfaction and gloom, I returned with my guardian to the living room. Aunt Sukey sent me in quest of Grandma'am. I found the widow seated before her bedroom fire. She looked up as I entered, and extending her hand drew me on her lap. "So it is my little gal: I was just wondering what she had done with herself." I kissed her pale cheek and replied, "that I had been settling the affairs of my realm, with my prime minister." She smiled, and inquired, "how we got on?"-"Oh, nicely; he lays down the law, and I obey. But seriously, Grandma'am, do you wish me to go to the parsonage?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, dear, I think it will be best. You must not doubt my love, Jessie, because I cross your inclination in this matter; my own wishes are as much thwarted as yours. I should be only too glad to keep you with me, my child, but I think Madam Compton has a prior claim, and I believe that it will be advantageous for you to reside with her. She is the most suitable person to fit you for your station in life."</p> 
               <p>I could not see why, my last hope was gone. Go to the parsonage I must. Well, "what could not be cured, must be endured!"</p> 
               <p>Determined to accept my fate with the best grace I could assume, with as much cheerfulness as I could summon, I accompanied Grandma'am to the kitchen.</p> 
               <p>The Bible having been placed on the stand, James, with a tone and manner much superior to any I had ever heard, read the 15th chapter of 1st Corinthians. It was not customary for our Puritan fathers to use the New Testament at family worship. Grandsir always read the Old in course, consequently the sweet, soul-inspiring words sounded new and strange. Pronounced in that low, rich voice, they fell like oil upon the troubled waters of my soul. The chapter finished, prayer was offered, a brief, earnest, appropriate supplication, very unlike Grandsir's somewhat lengthy formula, yet breathing such peace and hope, it seemed almost divine.</p> 
               <p>As Ruthy closed the chamber door, and I looked round the familiar room, I could not help sighing forth: "Oh I wish my Aunt Compton had not asked me to live with her!"</p> 
               <p>"You are going then?" Ruthy exclaimed, turning from the glass and gazing at me earnestly. "Yes, James and Grandma'am think I ought, though I must confess I do not quite understand their reasons."</p> 
               <p>"I do. It is for your interest to go Madam Compton is very rich, and you are her lawful heiress, though she can will her property as she pleases; but if you mind your p's and q's, and gain her blind side, I dare say you will get it all. James knows this; do as he bids; no danger but what he'll manage well."</p> 
               <p>"He would never entertain such motives, I am certain," I indignantly replied. "But am I so poor, Ruthy? I thought Grandsir left me some money in his will."</p> 
               <p>"Poor!" exclaimed my cousin in an amazed tone, turning to me as she spoke. "Bless you, child, what are you talking about? Why, didn't you know you was rich, immensely rich? Dear heart alive, to think that it should have been kept from you till now. Grandsir never would let any one speak of it before you, but your father was the richest man in the parish; now Grandsir has given you your mother's portion. You have the same as Aunt Rutledge and Aunt Sukey. If so lucky as to secure your Aunt Compton's fortune, you will be one of the greatest heiresses in the State."</p> 
               <p>I was greatly astonished. I knew little the value of money, and care had been taken to keep me in ignorance. My life hitherto had been passed in happy thoughtlessness, midst a sphere of solicitous affection. Care was a visitant I had never entertained; but this evening the thought had come that I might be poor and dependent. Though I was far from comprehending what a consequential personage I really was, in the world's eye, it was a great relief to know that I was not beholden to anybody.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE OLD MEETING-HOUSE.</head> 
               <p>FAMILY cares had called Uncle and Aunt Rutledge home the preceding evening, but they returned Sunday morning in time to accompany the family to meeting. Aunt Sukey drove Grandma'am in our chaise; Ruthy and I accompanied James.</p> 
               <p>The meeting-house, a square, time-embrowned structure, stood upon the summit of a high hill, up whose steep side the road wound in an almost per perpendicular ascent. As I have said the weather-beaten edifice did not boast a bell, but people in carriages and on foot were approaching from every direction. We fell into the line of chaises that were slowly clambering the hill, and drove to the shed where the horses were tied. Ruthy looked coquettishly pretty, as we approached the front door, near which was the old horse-block where groups of men and boys were gathered, and whispered to James, "that I had better go with her to the gallery, as our pew would be full." "She shall go with me, then you can sit with the family," he replied, and raking my hand, we proceeded up the centre aisle to the parsonage pew near the pulpit. As Parson Noles had no family, my Aunt Compton still retained this seat. She was already in her place, and received us with friendly courtesy. I regarded her with unwonted interest. She looked grand and stately, sitting perfectly erect in the high-backed, elaborately carved chair in the centre of the pew, her rich black attire rustling with the slightest movement. For a moment, I felt a little flustered at the notice I saw we attracted, but in a short time gained courage to look around.</p> 
               <p>The interior of this primitive meeting-house differed greatly from more modern structures. The centre or broad aisle was crossed at right angles by a narrower one terminating at two side-entrances; another aisle ran round the building, separating the wall pews from the body of the house. These pews were large, square compartments, surrounded by handsomely turned oaken balusters. The centre of the building was filled with benches, for the accommodation of elderly persons, males and females, each occupying a respective side. Above the high pulpit hung the huge sounding-board; beneath was the deacon's seat. The choir occupied the gallery opposite, which was reached by a flight of stairs either side of the front door. The side<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6399-00000008"/> galleries had a long pew extending the entire length of the wall. These were appropriated by young men on the male side, by maidens on that of the female; next came seats for boys and girls, while those in front were occupied by middle-aged men and women.</p> 
               <p>Nearly all the seats were filled. Two deacons had seated themselves behind the heavy oak communion-table. One place, alas, was empty! The venerable form that had occupied it that day week, was now resting beneath the cold mould.</p> 
               <p>The tithing-man, with his long pole, seated himself among the boys in the gallery. Parson Noles walked majestically up the aisle in his black gown and white bands, there was the clatter of many feet, every seat was filled, the last loiterer had entered, the sexton took his place at the head of the pulpit stairs, all became quiet.</p> 
               <p>The pastor rose and read the two first lines of a psalm, one of the deacons stepped forward, and repeated them in a slow, monotonous tone, the head singer, with his pitch-pipe, set the tune, and was followed by the choir; then two more were given out; thus the long psalm was sung. The notes requesting prayers in our bereavement having been read, all rose, and with bowed heads reverently stood through the half-hour dedicated to the service. After a hymn, came an excellent funeral sermon from the text: "And Enoch was not, for God took him." A copy having been preserved in the family, I can attest to its merits, but I was then too young to feel much interest in sermons; besides, I was watching my Aunt Compton, and recalling what I knew of her history. Leaning back in my corner, in imagination, I transformed the sombre, sable-clad figure into a blooming maiden, the darling of a large household, the belle of an aristocratic town circle. Then came the handsome, godly young minister to woo and win, the wedding solemnized with all the gayety and splendor allowable in those grave times; the sundering of girlish ties, and the removal to the new parsonage, which paternal love had built and furnished in a style unequalled in that infant parish, just reclaimed from the wilderness. With a decorous kindliness that won the respect and love of all, the young madam performed the duties pertaining to her honorable station, as minister's lady, and the head of a hospitable household. Years passed; her father, the beloved and skilful physician, had been gathered to his fathers; a beloved brother had died in a foreign land, leaving an orphan boy to swell the infant band at the parsonage. With what yearning tenderness these six bright-eyed children were reared! How the pale, grave father, and the silent dignified mother, sunned themselves in their smiles, and sympathized in their innocent joyousness! But a change was at hand-the despoiler was there. New England's scourge, the terrible throat distemper, which that year swept over the land, was then even at the door. One Saturday, the house resounded with the merry glee of childhood; baby feet pattered up and down; rosy faces were in all the rooms; the next, five of the little forms,-the whole of the pastor's children, were sleeping the sleep of death in their tiny graves upon the hill-side, and the sixth, the beloved orphan nephew, who, for two days, had been hovering between this world and the other, was lying helpless as an infant, but free from danger in the large family room, that now seemed so strangely still and empty.</p> 
               <p>After this, a laughing, singing, merry Hebe was sent to fill, for a time, the void in the bereft home; but just as the lovely maiden was merging into womanhood, she too was called; a short but terrible fever put an end to her earthly existence. Parson Compton had been growing feeble for some time, and this stroke completely prostrated him. Meekly bowing to his Father's decrees, he murmured, "Not as I will, but as Thou wilt"; and in one short month another grave was made, and the beloved shepherd, the true disciple, had joined his darling Jessie and sweet babes above.</p> 
               <p>The orphan nephew, Philip Bradshaw, was the only living member of the family over which Madam Compton had watched with such true maternal love and pride. How wildly now did her widowed, childless heart cling to him. In early manhood, with an unusual share of personal and mental endowments, the possessor of a large fortune, and the husband of a gentle spirit, every way qualified for his helpmeet, the future extended bright and clear. Rejoicing in the happiness of those she loved to call her children, who on their part, were untiring in their devotion to their bereaved relative, a few short years passed like a marriage bell, then death again claimed his own. My father went in a rapid consumption, my mother left this world as I entered it.</p> 
               <p>No wonder the sight of the feeble infant was more than my aunt's poor crushed heart could bear! No wonder I was willingly consigned to the care of my mother's family.</p> 
               <p>Now, however, when time had partly healed the spirit's wounds, when the babe was fast passing into girlhood, when she, in turn, was suffering from bereavement, the old love woke in the benumbed heart, the smothered fires were rekindled, the decision was made,-again there should be youth and love round the parsonage hearth.</p> 
               <p>Yes, there should be, I mentally resolved, as I noted my aunt's compressed lips and the spasmodic opening and shutting of her eyelids, the only token of the emotion that the sermon called forth. The whole audidience were affected by the eloquent pathos of the preacher. Many were sobbing, and several aged men had risen, and were leaning upon their sticks, or over the pews, with eyes intently fixed upon their pastor.</p> 
               <p>The more than an hour's sermon was finished; another petition was uttered, and a solemn benediction pronounced. There was a pause; the congregation stood in respectful waiting. Parson Noles slowly descended the pulpit stairs, my aunt taking me by the hand, joined him in the aisle; side by side we proceeded to the door, the Parson and my aunt returning the bows and courtesies of the people, as they went. Next came the elite from the pews, followed by the more humble portion of the congregation. Part of those from a distance spent the short intermission at the neighboring houses. Others remained at the meeting-house. A group of girls gathered in the gallery to talk over fashion and the beaux. With a demure air, several women congregated in the parsonage pew to discuss household matters, and gossip a little about their neighbors' affairs, but in a low tone, with serious faces, and pious ejaculations, as befitted the place and day. Uncle Vun having disposed of his doughnuts and cheese, struck fire with his tinder-box, and smoked in the deacon's seat.</p> 
               <p>Aunt Compton paused to greet Grandma'am and the family, James having told her that I would accept her offered kindness, she patted me on the shoulder most graciously.</p> 
               <p>James handed Grandma'am and Aunt Sukey to their chaise, then led forth his horse, and, as standing in the chill air had made the spirited animal restive, we were obliged to spring to our seats with all the agility possible.<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6399-00000009"/> Whirling about, before James was fairly seated, the fiery steed sprang through the crowd upon the hill-top. People stared, men shouted, women screamed, some essayed to seize the bridle, but were deterred by James' warning voice; on we rushed, thundering down the precipitous descent, dashing past the slow-moving country vehicles, throwing the small stones of the rough, gravelly road high in air. Never had children of the Puritans left the sacred precincts of the "meetin-us," on the "Sabba day," in such a scandalous fashion. Having gained the more level road, our steed condescended to slacken his pace a little. Ruthy had been half dead with fright, but I enjoyed the race, and greatly admired the cool skill of my driver. As Ruthy expressed it, "we were at home in no time." "Thank heaven!" she ejaculated, as her feet touched terra firma; "I hope you do not own that horrid beast."</p> 
               <p>"No, but I would if I could afford it. I am strongly tempted to commit the extravagance," said my guardian, as he patted the beautiful creature.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, do buy him," I exclaimed, as I timidly rubbed the nose he in the most friendly manner held down to me. "See how quiet and affectionate he is now. Take some of my money and buy him, James; but what is his name?"</p> 
               <p>"Peacock. How came you to know you had any money, Puss?"</p> 
               <p>"Ruthy told me that I was rich, so I will commission you to buy this horse, and you may have the honor to drive me in my airings." James smiled, cast an inquiring glance at Ruthy, then with a quizzical look, asked how rich I supposed myself.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I do not know, but think I can afford this horse, and another to match, with a green and gold carriage, and coachman and footman in livery, like the Donaldsons."</p> 
               <p>"Indeed, madame, but do the Donaldsons sport such style?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes; they have a princely establishment."</p> 
               <p>"Are they at the farm now?"</p> 
               <p>"No; I met Miss Kate at Squire Norton's last week, and she said she was on the eve of flitting to their mansion in town."</p> 
               <p>James laughed. "Pretty good, pet; you haven't forgotten how to mimic, I see."</p> 
               <p>"Miss Kate inquired very particularly for you; said she expected you would be quite irresistible upon your return, with all the polish of foreign travel added to your former charms."</p> 
               <p>My guardian gave a long, low whistle, and I laughed with inconsiderate glee.</p> 
               <p>Ruthy sharply bade me come in. I obeyed, as James led Peacock to the barn.</p> 
               <p>"I should think you were the deacon's grandchildren by the way you two are behaving!" she exclaimed, as I followed her up stairs. "One might know James had been in some heathen place; but with your bringing up, I should think you would know better than to chatter at such a rate about secular concerns on the Sabbath, right after Grandsir's funeral, too. I am ashamed of you, Jessie."</p> 
               <p>Self-condemned, I subsided into my usual "Sabba-day" demureness. Luncheon (few families had dinner on this day) was served as soon as the rest had arrived; the short noon sped; the carriages were again brought to the door.</p> 
               <p>Ruthy declared that nothing would tempt her to ride again with James, so joined Grandma'am and Aunt Sukey. Aunt Rutledge invited me to a seat in her carriage, but I declined; "I liked both horse and driver; I would go with my guardian." "There spoke her father's own child," said my aunt. "He always had the best and handsomest horses money could purchase, and he was the best and most fearless horseman in all the country side. Why, he always came across, through brake and brier, over walls and ditches, when he was courting Bethia."</p> 
               <p>"That would be just the beau for me," I laughingly exclaimed, as I sprang to my seat.</p> 
               <p>"How your eyes sparkle, Jessie," said James, as he followed; "but how came Ruthy to say you was rich?"</p> 
               <p>I repeated the conversation of the preceding evening, faithfully reporting the mercenary view she had taken of his desire for me to go to the parsonage. I saw his cheek flush as I spoke. Turning, and looking me steadily in the eyes, he said: "You did not believe that, Jessie?"</p> 
               <p>"No, and though I am willing to go to the parsonage, it is because I pity a lonely old woman. I am sure I do not care how she disposes of her property."</p> 
               <p>"Of course not; you have too much of your own to scheme for more, would willingly have kept the knowledge of your position from you a little longer, but perhaps it is as well as it is. It is time you commenced the education of a gentlewoman, and began to understand the adulation you will receive. As the courted and envied heiress, you will have constant cause for circumspection. Great wealth brings great responsibility, and elevation of station has its corresponding cares and perplexities."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, James," I exclaimed, quite appalled by this glimpse at futurity, "I wish I was not such an heiress! Can't you take some of my money, or do something to make me poorer?"</p> 
               <p>My companion laughed, I thought most immoderately, and replied, that he did not see any opportunity at present, but that Fortune was such a fickle goddess she might possibly grant such an earnest request. "I did not mean to frighten you, Jessie. I doubt not you will have wisdom for your dignified place in society. In the mean time, fit yourself for any station; you will have every advantage, improve every opportunity to the best of your ability. A judiciously educated, well-regulated mind is a priceless treasure that cannot be wrested from you."</p> 
               <p>"I will do my best, but I have learned the cause of that mysterious whispering last evening. Aunt Nabby is worried about some money that Grandma'am has. She thinks the old lady has obtained it contrary to the terms of her marriage settlement. She and Ruthy were telling Aunt Sukey about it last night, and did not wish me to hear."</p> 
               <p>"Indeed, how did you find this out?"</p> 
               <p>"Aunt Sukey called me into the fore-room this noon, and talked it over with Aunt Rutledge. They asked me if she had the money."</p> 
               <p>"Did you know?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, yes; I have often had the silver to play with. There are a hundred dollars tied up in a bag made from an old stocking. I told them that it was kept in the right hand deep drawer, in the case of drawers in the bedroom."</p> 
               <p>"What did they say?"</p> 
               <p>"Aunt Rutledge was thankful that she was not disposed to peep into people's drawers, and worry about their contents. Aunt Sukey did not believe Grandma'am had got the money unjustly, and added that she would never be repaid for all she had done in the family, let her have what she would."</p> 
               <p>"That is true," said James emphatically;" she has been a mother to us all, though Aunt Sukey nursed you, and Ruthy has been her assistant of late. Grandma'am has been a hardworking, care-taking woman; she has<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6399-00000010"/> fairly earned every penny. Aunt Nabby has her good traits, but she has rather too close an eye to the gear."</p> 
               <p>"Aunt Rutledge said she had only one eye, and that turned in. I could not at first think what she meant, as Aunt Nabby has very handsome eyes, but I comprehend now."</p> 
               <p>My companion joined in my laugh at the conceit, but immediately bade me hush, as we were nearing the meeting-house. "Come directly out when meeting is over," he directed, as he lifted me from the chaise. Accordingly, I bade Aunt Compton a hasty good-by, when the afternoon service had closed, and hurried to the shed. James was holding the reins, and we were off in a twinkling; but, instead of going the direct route, my cousin turned in the opposite direction, which led home by a more circuitous way, over the main road.</p> 
               <p>"Where are you going, James? You must not take a ride on the Sabbath day, the tithing-man will stop you!"</p> 
               <p>"Do you think he could?" was inquired with a serio-comic expression.</p> 
               <p>I laughed, and the conversation diverged to various family matters, the knowledge of which my companion's long absence rendered necessary. He also gave me directions for the future, with much good advice, that afterward proved of infinite service. Notwithstanding our longer drive, we were at home nearly as soon as the others Uncle John, with his wife and children joined us, as Grandma'am desired to see the whole of the family assembled once more round the social board. Supper was soon ready, but the though that this was the last time we should thus meet, effectually deadened my appetite.</p> 
               <p>After the meal was over, Grandma'am called the children round her to repeat the catechism. We had been accustomed to say it to Grandsir every Sabbath evening; but I had not thought of t since the preceding Sunday, and as usual, without preparatory study, was much at fault, requiring continual prompting.</p> 
               <p>"Did you ever see such a child?" Aunt Nabby impatiently exclaimed. "I should think, Jessie, you would be ashamed of yourself. Here's my Sammy, only five ye'r old, can say every word."</p> 
               <p>"Jessie cannot help having a poor memory," said Ruthy, with a show of patronage I was in no mood to relish.</p> 
               <p>"I haven't a poor memory," I quickly returned. "I can remember what I understand,-what I like. I can say nearly the whole of that beautiful chapter James read last night, and I never recollect having heard it before, and I have only read it twice to-day."</p> 
               <p>"Repeat it," said my guardian, as he drew me beside him.</p> 
               <p>After a moment's thought, I began: "Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?" Entering into the spirit of the inspired words, I was able to give the remainder of the chapter, fully and distinctly.</p> 
               <p>There was silence when I had finished. Scarcely an eye was dry. James drew me on his knee, enfolded me in his arms, and silently laid his cheek to mine. How sweet that moment was! how it has lived in memory!</p> 
               <p>This slight glimpse of heaven was suddenly shut out-as it always must be in this imperfect existence. Ruthy, in a shrill tone, hurriedly proclaimed that the sun had set; then came the clatter of dishes, not one of which was ever allowed to be washed from sunset Saturday evening to sunset Sunday night. I was called to assist. It was dark before the crockery was in order and beds made. Then came getting the tubs from the cellar, and other preparations for washing, as Ruthy declared everything must be in readiness for Molly Pinn, as there would be such a hard day's work on the morrow.</p> 
               <p>After quiet had been restored, we again drew around the bright fire in the kitchen. Grandma'am slipped out, returning in an instant bearing in her hand the identical bag of money that had caused so much commotion.</p> 
               <p>"Here is some silver," she said, seating herself and untying the string. "I brought it with me when I married your Sir. It is part of the portion I received from my father's estate; I have kept it by me in case of emergency. Now, I wish to give each of you something by which you can remember the old woman; tain't much, but it expresses my good will, and you can buy something that will bring the old days to mind." With a face beaming with affection and kindness, the old lady counted out ten dollars for each of my aunts, and Uncle John and James. Ruthy and I received five, the other grandchildren one apiece.</p> 
               <p>This generosity was received with tender gratitude. Aunt Nabby and Ruthy had the grace to look a little foolish. Aunt Sukey's black eyes sparkled triumphantly as she exchanged glances with Aunt Rutledge. I gave my money to James, with the desire that he should purchase me a gold brooch, in which to inclose my parents' and grandparents' hair. He promised to procure one the first time he visited Boston.</p> 
               <p>After some consultation, it was decided that Uncle John should remove to "South-end" Wednesday. Aunt Rutledge said she would come Tuesday to assist in dividing the furniture and Grandsir's personal effects.</p> 
               <p>James requested Ruthy to have my wardrobe in order, that he might take me to the parsonage Tuesday afternoon.</p> 
               <p>These matters concluded, the moon having risen, our visitors bade us good night.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER V.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE PARSONAGE.</head> 
               <p>TUESDAY morning, James drew me aside to explain, that in the division of household furniture and effects about to take place, he should select only a few cherished mementoes, and advised me to a like course. "The furniture will be of use to our relatives, but only an encumbrance to us. I have chosen Grandsir's stock, knee and shoe buckles, his Bible, 'Fox's Book of Martyrs,' and a few sermons and pamphlets. You had better look over the things, as you will fee permitted a free choice."</p> 
               <p>Acting upon this hint, I soon made up my pile; a few pieces of favorite glass and plate, a little pitcher that had been brought from England by the Mistress Alice Lee, our maternal progenitor, and some linen of my mother's spinning and weaving. The holders were mine by right, and James handed me Grandsir's silver stock buckle, remarking that it was just the thing to fasten my sash.</p> 
               <p>A few moments sufficed for these arrangements, but our relatives met with much difficulty. Aunt Rutledge and Aunt Nabby had a controversy over a table-cloth, which, from some early association, Aunt Rutledge wished to possess, but which Aunt Nabby declared "his marm had gin to her John."</p> 
               <p>Aunt Rutledge, an easy-tempered woman, soon yielded to the pertinacity of her sister-in-law; not so with the more decided Aunt Sukey, who fully maintained her rights. She and Ruthy had such a dispute respecting a small<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6399-00000011"/> copper tea-kettle, that the two did not speak together for months; Aunt Sukey declaring that she had purchased the kettle with her own money, for her convenience, when I was an infant; Ruthy as stoutly asserting that Grandsir had said that the utensil should be hers in case of his death or her marriage.</p> 
               <p>Words grew so high, that I was fain to seek the quiet of my chamber. Ruthy soon came to complete the preparations for my departure for the parsonage, "You are to take the small, red trunk. Father will fetch the others to-morrow," she said, as she fastened my gown. "What shall I do without you, Ruthy?" I moaned. My distress dispelled my cousin's ill-nature in a degree. In the main, she was a good girl and pleasant companion; we had much to bind us together. Kissing me she soothingly returned: "You must come to see us often; I shall run over to the parsonage when I can muster courage, but you know how awfully grand the Madam is." My aunts and Grandma'am bade me adieu with affection and words of encouragement. Swallowing my tears, I followed my trunk into the chaise, but as we turned from the house, I could not forbear from weeping hysterically.</p> 
               <p>James was most kind and considerate, and I was soon able to command myself. How new was this lesson of self-control! How fast I had lived in the past week. Years seemed to have been crowded into the seven days.</p> 
               <p>The parsonage lay beyond the meeting-house, below the brow of the hill It did not belong to the parish; the farm had been purchased, and the buildings erected by my Grandfather Bradshaw as a wedding dower for hi daughter. The house, a double, two-story structure, white in front, with red ends, stood in the midst of a smooth lawn, shaded by elms. A neat picket fence separated the enclosure from the grassy country road. In the rear were a substantial barn and other farm buildings.</p> 
               <p>No one appeared at our arrival. In silence, we proceeded up the gravel-walk. Our knock was answered by a tall, spare woman, in a brown woolen gown and skirt, and white linen cap. She held the corner of her checked apron in her hand; with a slight courtesy, in a curt tone, bade us enter.</p> 
               <p>I intuitively felt that it would require some exertion to gain Miss Peggy Wyat's good graces. Entering the wide hall, with its staircase of low, white steps, and handsome, dark balusters, its massive, antique furniture, and one picture on the wall,-a view of Harvard University, in somewhat inaccurate perspective, we turned into the parlor, the door of which Miss Peggy, with pursed-up lips, held open. My aunt rose to meet us. Having assisted me to take off my things, she went out to give directions respecting Mr. Lee's horse, and to summon Parson Noles, who, being a bachelor, had always resided with her.</p> 
               <p>The fire flashed upon the brass fire-set and china tiles of the chimney, glinted in the dark wainscot, and lighted the leaden-hued paper on the wall. On the centre of the polished hard-pine floor lay a square Turkey carpet, with a rose-entwined border; elaborately carved high-backed chairs, with cane seats, were arranged beyond. Above the curious, antique table, hung a large mirror; opposite was a portrait of my Grandfather Bradshaw, a handsome, middle-aged man, in red coat, white wig, and delicate lace ruffles. Above the oval stand depended a small painting of my Cousin Jessie.</p> 
               <p>I gazed at this picture with unwonted interest; as the firelight warmed the tints, it gave such a life-like vivacity to the beautiful face, that I almost fancied the spirit had, for the instant, visited the shadow of its former enshrinement, that the sweet one was bidding me welcome to her place on earth.</p> 
               <p>James noticing my gaze, turned to the portrait. I inquired if he thought me like my cousin.</p> 
               <p>"There is a resemblance, but you are not so pretty."</p> 
               <p>My aunt and the parson now entered; an animated conversation ensued. James had made good use of his sojourn abroad; his descriptions were both instructive and entertaining. How wide the world was, how little I knew! With an humble sense of ignorance and inferiority, I took my knitting-case from my pocket and commenced working most diligently.</p> 
               <p>The short afternoon was drawing to a close. My aunt went out, and the parson turned to me, exclaiming, "What an industrious little body we have here."</p> 
               <p>No, I was a sad, idle girl, had given Grandma'am much trouble.</p> 
               <p>"Indeed; but I suppose the catechism is mastered by this time?"</p> 
               <p>This was a sore subject, but childish things were passing away. With a deep blush, I replied in the negative.</p> 
               <p>"No?" the parson looked grave.</p> 
               <p>"She cannot commit to memory what does not immediately strike her taste or fancy; but, with proper training, this will be corrected," James kindly interposed.</p> 
               <p>"True, true, I understand," rejoined the clergyman. "We can't turn her into a parrot." James smiled, and trusted that I should improve, do honor to my place and position. Tea being announced, we followed the parson to the back sitting-room, and seated ourselves at the round table, with its rich display of china, tiny cups, fragile as egg-shells, miniature spoons, with teapot, cream-pitcher and sugar-bowl of like Liliputian dimensions.</p> 
               <p>The meal over, Peacock was led to the door. With an immense effort, I suppressed my emotion, and bade James good-by.</p> 
               <p>"Keep up a brave heart, pet; you will see me soon," was whispered with a farewell kiss.</p> 
               <p>How desolate I felt as I watched the chaise from view.</p> 
               <p>"Would you like to come to the library?"</p> 
               <p>I turned; Parson Noles was beside me with kindly pity in his benign face.</p> 
               <p>I was happy to accept the invitation. I had never before entered this apartment. At that twilight hour it was a sombre place; bookshelves occupied two sides, a writing-table stood in the centre.</p> 
               <p>The books, to one unaccustomed to more than half a dozen in the whole house, were truly astonishing.</p> 
               <p>"You never saw these before?"</p> 
               <p>"No. Are they all yours?"</p> 
               <p>"Most of them belonged to your Uncle Compton."</p> 
               <p>"Did they? may I read them?"</p> 
               <p>"I am afraid that would be a more formidable task than learning the catechism; but you may choose any you like; I will light a candle."</p> 
               <p>"Here is a Josephus, full of pictures."</p> 
               <p>"Do you like pictures?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, and I wish to read the book."</p> 
               <p>The clergyman looked surprised, but gave me the candle; lighting another for himself, he commenced writing.</p> 
               <p>My aunt came to look after me, but finding that I was not in the parson's way, left me to my reading.</p> 
               <p>The hours were chimed from the tall clock in the hall, but I was far away among the Judean hills. The sudden removal of my candle brought me to present realities.</p> 
               <p>"I could not make you hear," the parson laughingly explained. "We are to have a great student, if not a<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6399-00000012"/> busy bee; but it is time for prayers; the family await us in the sitting-room." The evening worship rendered, the parson returned to the library. Peggy opened the doors of a press bed, and commenced arrangements for the night, as Madam Compton made this her sleeping-room.</p> 
               <p>Job took my trunk, and. preceded by my aunt, I ascended to the chamber above. It was a large, cheerful room, with three pleasant windows shaded by, white muslin curtains; a high-posted bedstead similarly draperied; a case of drawers, green chairs and table, and an antique dressing-glass. This had been my cousin's room; here she had died.</p> 
               <p>Aunt Compton's eyes filled as Job left us; with a sudden yearning, I threw my arms around my stately relative, and sobbed forth my desire to fill in a measure the vacant place.</p> 
               <p>I think she was surprised; but lifting my face, she kissed me affectionately, saying, I had my father's kind heart, and my mother's winning manner. In her usual subdued way, she unlocked my trunk, placed its contents in the drawers, and assisted me to undress.</p> 
               <p>At that instant, my eye fell upon a sampler wrought in bright silks, framed and glassed, which hung above the mantle. Approaching, I read: "Jessie Bradshaw Compton, aged ten."</p> 
               <p>"Did my cousin work this when only ten years old?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes; can't her namesake mark?"</p> 
               <p>"A little; I have done a small yellow thing."</p> 
               <p>"You shall make a twin to this some time. Do not forget your prayers my dear" With another kiss, I was left to my slumbers.</p> 
               <p>It seemed strange at first; I should have liked a chat with Ruthy, but did not feel half as lonely and homesick as I had anticipated.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE NEW HOME, AND THE PARISH WITCH.</head> 
               <p>THE next morning a neighbor came in haste for my aunt. One of his children was very ill, the doctor was absent, the madam must prescribe and advise.</p> 
               <p>After she had gone, the parson rode away.</p> 
               <p>Having arranged my room, I went for a book, but found the library door locked. What should I do to pass the time?</p> 
               <p>Peggy was churning, the breakfast dishes still stood upon the table. I volunteered my assistance. The offer elicited a contemptuous huff.</p> 
               <p>Madam Compton had received her niece into the household without consulting her handmaiden; the slight was not to be overlooked in a moment.</p> 
               <p>I had a will as well as Miss Peggy; so taking a wooden piggin from the dresser, I dipped some water from a kettle over the fire, and commenced operations. At this, Peggy condescended to supply me with dishcloth and towel; but my handiwork was subjected to a strict scrutiny, every dish being minutely examined ere it was put in its place. I had been trained as particularly as Miss Peggy could desire; nothing having been found amiss, I saw that I had risen considerably in her estimation.</p> 
               <p>The morning work completed, I went forth to inspect the premises. I found Job husking in the barn-floor, and proceeded to make his acquaintance. After an half-hour's chat, I returned to the house with an apron full of hens'-eggs for Peggy. As I deposited the eggs in a basket upon the dresser, a rooster under the window clapped his wings and crowed. "Now what did you do that for, you foolish cockerel?" exclaimed Peggy. "That will sartinly bring a stranger, and 'tisn't baking day till to-morrow and we are e'en-just out of vittles."</p> 
               <p>"Pho, Peggy, you do not suppose the crower knows who is coming, do you?"</p> 
               <p>"I never knowed the sign to fail," was the dry rejoinder. As she spoke, a boy apparently two or three years older than myself entered the yard, followed by a large, handsome black dog. I had never seen the lad before, and his air and appearance showed that he was not one of our country youths. "All honor to signs, Peggy! Here is your stranger coming," I exclaimed. "Do come to the window and tell me who it is."</p> 
               <p>Peggy, who was carding wool in the chimney corner, rose, card in hand, and came forward. "Why, that's nobody but Dwight Sprague, a Boston boy, that came last week to the old maid Neals. His father and mother are dead, and his relatives can't manage him, so they have put him under Master Neal's care; but somehow he's contrived to gain even the master's blind side, and manages to do pretty much as he likes. He's a dreadful plague. Aunt Judy says she believes he'll drive her distracted with his racket and nonsense."</p> 
               <p>As Peggy spoke, the dog took after a pet kitten, and before his master could call him off, the frightened-animal had taken refuge on the well-sweep. Peggy, card in hand, rushed to the rescue. The dog having been chased from the yard, she returned panting and breathless. Having lost her cap and comb in the mele with long gray hair streaming in the wind, and irate eyes, the angry woman commenced scolding the lad.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, yes, I will teach Turk better manners; but call the little cat down, or she will be in the well.</p> 
               <p>Peggy advanced a step, and shrilly called "Kit, Kit," but as the frightened kitten only mewed piteously, the boy went around the well-curb and gently cried "Puss, Puss," while I joined the chorus with a persuasive "Kitty, Kitty." But in a moment the ludicrous-ness of our situation became too much for the lad and myself, and we burst into a hearty laugh.</p> 
               <p>This was the drop too much for Peggy's ire. Flinging a small pail that stood near the well at me, she launched the card at Dwight with such good aim that it caught dangling from his thick, curling locks, while the blood ran over his white brow. I sprang to his assistance.</p> 
               <p>Angry gleams were darting from the blue eyes, but not a word was spoken, as with compressed lips, the card was withdrawn, then turning, in a calm, determined manner he confronted Peggy, who was putting on her cap, with the inquiry of, what she meant? "I drove away Turk, and was trying to get your kitten."</p> 
               <p>"No you wan't; you and this other sarce-box was laughing at me."</p> 
               <p>I hastened to disclaim any such intention.</p> 
               <p>"We were laughing at ourselves as much as at you, we all cut such a queer figure; so make friends my lady, and apologize for this scratch. Only see how you have spoiled my beauty! right before this stranger angel, too! Oh, what a pity it is we are not Catholics,-you would have to go straight to confession for this job."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I 'm sorry I scratched you, but you mus'nt try my temper so; but here comes Madam Compton, and she will give you a plaster that will cure it"; and picking up the kitten, who had now safely descended, she went into the house, while Master Sprague and I walked forth to meet my aunt.</p> 
               <p>She smiled in her quiet way as we related the incident, and told us we must be careful not to affront Peggy,<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6399-00000013"/> for though quick-tempered and odd, at heart she was one of the best of women.</p> 
               <p>The plaster having been applied, Dwight proceeded to assist Uncle John, who had arrived with my luggage. The trunks having been carried above, and my uncle taken his leave, I unpacked my silver and china, and accompanied by my aunt, went to the parlor to place them in the buffet.</p> 
               <p>Master Sprague having been invited to assist us, the things were soon in their places. With curious eyes, the lad scanned the ware. "What a cunning cup," he exclaimed, as he raised one of blue china that would hold about a tablespoonful.</p> 
               <p>"That is one that my husband used when a college student," Aunt Compton replied, as she turned away.</p> 
               <p>"What a pretty room this is, Jessie: may I call you Jessie?"</p> 
               <p>"Whose portrait is that over the mantle?"</p> 
               <p>"My Grandfather Bradshaw's; this is one of my Cousin Jessie; I am her namesake."</p> 
               <p>"What a beautiful girl! How like you are to her."</p> 
               <p>Do you see a likeness? She was the sixth child that my Aunt Compton has buried."</p> 
               <p>Tears rose in my companion's eyes as he softly returned: "Every one has their bereavements, I see."</p> 
               <p>Oh, yes, I am all alone, almost. All are dead but James, Grandma'am, Aunt Compton-."</p> 
               <p>"And lots more," the lad laughingly interposed.</p> 
               <p>I joined in the laugh, but replied that my Aunt Compton was so reserved and stately, I feared that I should never feel at ease with her.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, you will, as soon as you know her better; and she must love you, you are so like that sweet picture."</p> 
               <p>"I am not as handsome."</p> 
               <p>"Who says so?"</p> 
               <p>"My cousin, Mr. James Lee."</p> 
               <p>"He is infallible authority, I perceive."</p> 
               <p>I was slightly provoked at the mischievous smile that accompanied this reply, and tartly returned, "that my cousin always told me the exact truth, and that I detested flattery."</p> 
               <p>So do I; I will tell you the exact truth. Let me look at you. You are not as handsome as that portrait now, but in a few years you will be; girls at your age are rarely beautiful; the transition between childhood and girlhood is a plain period, but at sixteen I am certain that you will bear comparison with this picture, and there is a thoughtful pensiveness to your face that this one never possessed, which adds much to its charm. I suppose you inherited that from your mother."</p> 
               <p>How this boy talked! I gazed at him with amazement, and inquired his age.</p> 
               <p>"Fifteen last month; old enough to be wiser and better. I must go home and study, good-by. We are to be good friends, are we not?"</p> 
               <p>I hoped so, but returned to the kitchen in rather an amazed, uncertain state of mind.</p> 
               <p>Peggy looked up from her carding with the request that, I would "go into t' other room and ask the Madam for jest a drop of spereit. This flurry has set me all of a quake," she said, with a shiver.</p> 
               <p>I delivered the message. My aunt smiled, took a wine-glass from the cupboard, put in a lump of loaf-sugar, then filled the glass from a spirit case under the table. I carried it to the kitchen.</p> 
               <p>Put it on the dresser till the sugar has dissolved," said Peggy.</p> 
               <p>At this moment, Dwight Sprague's roguish face peered in from the half-open door, "Peggy, Peggy," he exclaimed; "here's the witch! Where can I find an awl? I want to stick it in her chair to see if she can't rise from it, while it is there, as you say."</p> 
               <p>"Bless and save us! Don't be tempting the divil, boy; he has dealings enough with you already!" she affrightedly replied.</p> 
               <p>As Peggy ceased speaking, Goody Sloper, the sexton's wife, who, either from her gray eyes and hooked nose, or from a peculiarly strong, penetrating character, had been dubbed with the doubtful cognomen of witch, entered the back door, bearing a bunch of yarn she had been spinning for my aunt. "Good day, young Miss and Master; how fares it with ye, Peggy? and how is the dear Madam? I am afraid she has wondered what I was doing with her rolls so long," she continued, seating herself in the chair Dwight officiously placed before the fire. "But the truth is, my old man had a spell week afore last Friday, and somehow as I was warming his bed, I burnt my hand with the pan. It was bad I couldn't spin for nigh a week; but it is done at last. Here are twenty skeins; you will please take them in to the madam."</p> 
               <p>Peggy had started with a look of horror, as the Goody mentioned her burnt hand; now she took the yarn at arm's length and left the room.</p> 
               <p>Dwight, who had stealthily abducted a darning-needle from Peggy's thread-case, which, with her scissors and pin-ball, hung by the chimney, now came forward; glancing hastily round, his eye fell upon the glass of spirit upon the dresser. Seizing it, he politely handed it to the witch, remarking "that it was a cold day, and there was something to warm her."</p> 
               <p>The woman smiled, thanked him, and began to sip the liquor, while she inquired respecting his Aunt Sprague and her daughters. Dwight answered most sociably, meanwhile dexterously thrusting the needle under the seat of her chair.</p> 
               <p>This effected, the Goody handed back the empty glass, which, with a sly glance to me, the lad placed upon the dresser, refilling it with water, so that it presented the exact appearance that it did when Peggy went out.</p> 
               <p>My aunt now came in with her maid; and, after receiving her pay and another bunch of rolls, the Goody essayed to rise. The hot fire and strong rum had probably rendered her somewhat dizzy, for she sallied back, and came near falling again into her seat; but instantly recovering herself, with courtesies and good-days to each, she made her way out.</p> 
               <p>Dwight drew forth the needle with a laugh.</p> 
               <p>"Now I hope ye'r satisfied, boy! You see the old hag could hardly stem it. If that steel had been larger, she might have sot there till doomsday afore she would have stirred. And I declare, my flesh creeps when I think of her burnt hand."</p> 
               <p>"Why? It was not very bad, Peggy!"</p> 
               <p>"'Taint that. She ought to have jest sich a sizzling all over! Don't ye remember the night White-face had sich a tantrum, and kicked over the milk-pail?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I recollect the heifer kicked over the milk."</p> 
               <p>"Well, unbeknown to anybody, I cut some hair from the eend of her tail, and threw it on the fire. I knowed she was bewitched, but raly, I shouldn't have durst laid it to Goody Sloper afore. It makes me feel queer to think on't."</p> 
               <p>"But, Peggy, she said it was week before last Friday that she burnt her hand, and it was the next Wednesday night the heifer kicked; so your burning the hair had nothing to do with her accident."</p> 
               <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6399-00000014"/> 
               <p>"You needn't try to tell me black is white, Dwight Sprague, though I 'm free to allow you've wonderful learning for a chap of your years. Lawful suz, I have a real qualm! Give me that glass, Jessie. The Lord presarve us from witches!" she exclaimed, as she raised it to her lips, taking a dainty sip; but the liquid had no sooner reached her taste, than with a look of amazement the glass was lowered; then, raising it before her eyes with scrutinizing gaze, she inquired, "if the madam had not given me some Santa Cruz?"</p> 
               <p>I meekly replied in the affirmative.</p> 
               <p>"Then what in the varsal world has come to it? Why, it won't burn!" she affrightedly exclaimed, as she poured a drop on the coals.</p> 
               <p>"Don't you think it is bewitched, Peggy?" Dwight soberly inquired. "If Goody Soper could go through a key-hole, why could she not imbibe the spirit from that rum, and leave a tasteless liquid behind, without so much as leaving her seat?"</p> 
               <p>"Gracious, so she might! What a wonderful knowledgeable lad you are, Dwight; I raly believe you may be the president, if you will try. Lawful sakes, we shall all be possessed by the divil next. Yaw! I quake wus than ever," she added; turning the contents of her glass behind the back-log, she handed it me, bidding me rinse it, and get it refilled, for her stomach was "as cold as a stone."</p> 
               <p>Nearly suffocating with suppressed laughter, I gladly rose to do Peggy's bidding.</p> 
               <p>Aunt Compton, with an amused look pronounced Dwight a wild boy, as she replenished the glass. Upon my re turn with the rum, I found Peggy had commenced preparations for dinner, at the same time entertaining Dwight, who was stretched on the form in the corner, with the recital of a wonderful story about a charmed log drawn by a yoke of white-faced and black-faced oxen, <emph>without heads.</emph>
               </p> 
               <p>As I possessed none of his self-possession, I ran out to meet the parson, whom I had descried at the foot of the hill.</p> 
               <p>Reaching the meeting-house, I mounted the horse-block and gazed around. Before me, stretched an irregular line of buildings, marking the curvings of the main road, with here and there, glimpses of the blue Merrimac, and the rolling hills and snug homesteads of the Amesbury shore. Turning, my eye wandered over Ash swamp, to the lofty eminence of Crane-neck hill, with its thrifty farms, and brown dwellings, nestling cosily amongst their surrounding orchards. With blinding tears, I was gazing at my dear old South-end home, when the parson's cheery tones summoned me to the road.</p> 
               <p>"Would our little girl like a ride?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, much," I replied, as I skipped down from my pedestal.</p> 
               <p>"Can you ride on my saddle?" he asked, as he dismounted.</p> 
               <p>Yes, without one. I used to catch Dobbin for Grandsir, when he was out to pasture."</p> 
               <p>"You did? jump on, then!"</p> 
               <p>I sprang on the saddle, and after curveting round the green, cantered up to the parsonage. Dwight came forth, and gallantly assisted me to dismount, complimenting me upon "my fine horsemanship."</p> 
               <p>After dinner, the parson inquired, "If I had been devouring Josephus all the morning?"</p> 
               <p>I reminded him that the door had been locked during his absence.</p> 
               <p>"So it was; Peggy is so apt to clear up while I am away, I usually lock the door; but you shall have the key in future."</p> 
               <p>I thanked my new friend, and proposed posed to ask Peggy's permission to take the care of the room for the future.</p> 
               <p>The clergyman was much pleased with this proposition, and requested me to accompany him to the library, as he wished to ascertain my educational attainments. "Are they equal to your equestrianism?" he asked, with a smile. I laughingly shook my head, as with some trepidation I followed the parson as he directed. I had no cause for fear, however; my acquirements were respectable for a girl of my age at that period.</p> 
               <p>After my dismissal, though the sight of Josephus was a sore temptation, I brought my lap-bag, and inquired if my aunt would not like my assistance in her sewing? "Thank you, dear, if you can stitch, it will be a great help. These fine collars and wristbands of the parson's are trying for my old eyes."</p> 
               <p>I took a collar, and seating myself by a window, commenced to work.</p> 
               <p>At that instant, Dwight's rosy face, suddenly pressed against the pane, caused me to look up with a start.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, you naughty boy," I exclaimed, "see how you have made me prick my thumb!"</p> 
               <p>"That is a pity," he replied with a ludicrous look of mock contrition, "I'll come in and kiss it; wont that cure it?"</p> 
               <p>I pouted, and bade him go away.</p> 
               <p>"That means come in," he returned. "I am coming." Passing round the house, he entered by the back hall door; proceeding directly to the sitting room, hat in hand, he informed my aunt that he was going to the pasture to gather nuts; "might I accompany him?"</p> 
               <p>Before my aunt could reply, I saucily returned, that I thought it would be more polite to first inquire if I wished to go.</p> 
               <p>With a low bow, pardon was begged. "Would Miss Jessie bestow the honor and pleasure of her society for the excursion?"</p> 
               <p>I would fain have laughed, but with becoming gravity replied, I preferred to finish my work.</p> 
               <p>"Your pleasure is my law," my new acquaintance courteously replied, as he seated himself at the table beside me.</p> 
               <p>Aunt Compton had been adjusting some accounts,-the writing materials were still upon the table.</p> 
               <p>With a request to use them, the youth drew a sheet of paper before him, and dipping the pen in the ink, commenced drawing with great assiduity.</p> 
               <p>An hour passed in silence. From time to time I cast furtive glances at this city lad, so different in every respect from any boy I had hitherto known. His hand glided steadily over the paper for a time, then, with a pause, the head would be raised, the brown curls shaken back with an abstracted look, when with new light in the eyes, and fresh smiles wreathing the handsome mouth, the work would be resumed.</p> 
               <p>I had finished my sewing. As I laid it aside, Dwight handed me his drawing.</p> 
               <p>What was my surprise at beholding a most graphic and ludicrous sketch of the kitten-scene of the morning. For a pen and ink outline, it was wonderful.</p> 
               <p>"Who taught you to draw, Dwight?" inquired my aunt, after our merriment had somewhat subsided.</p> 
               <p>"Dame Nature. My mother taught me to mix colors, and paint flowers, but I was born to the work; no one ever gave me lessons in landscape or figures; I have picked up a little knowledge here and there, the rest is intuition. I could make a great artist, but my Uncle Sprague pronounces them poor, worthless scape-graces, so I suppose that I must accept my destiny and become a merchant."</p> 
               <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6399-00000015"/> 
               <p>"That will be the most prudent course, but it is not necessary to relinquish your love for art in consequence. Cultivate it as much as possible; such tastes are great safeguards for a young man."</p> 
               <p>"Others pronounce it a sinful waste of time, but I cannot conceive why this taste and talent should be given if it is not to be used and improved."</p> 
               <p>"You have the right idea, Dwight. God's gifts ought never to be buried." Glancing to me, my aunt asked: "If I would not like to accompany Master Sprague. The walnut grove was quite a pretty place."</p> 
               <p>"I should be happy to." Procuring a basket from Peggy, which Dwight gallantly took from my hands, we leisurely sauntered down the cow-lane, in the direction of a clump of hickory trees at the farther end of the pasture.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">DWIGHT SPRAGUE.</head> 
               <p>MY escort and I were soon in a confidential chat. After I had described my past life, my grandfather's death, and various other family incidents, Dwight spoke of his father, who had died during his son's infancy, and of the idolized mother, who had recently departed; of his relatives and former home.</p> 
               <p>"How came your Uncle Sprague to send you away from him; ar'nt there good schools in Boston, Dwight?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, excellent schools, but I am such a reckless, roguish fellow they did not know what to do with me. I put my fidgety, fine lady aunt to her wits' end, and horrified my prim, fashionable cousins. My Uncle pronounced me a nuisance that must be got rid of, so I was sent to Dummer's Academy last June."</p> 
               <p>"Why did you not stay there?"</p> 
               <p>"My unlucky genius, Fun, prevented it."</p> 
               <p>"What did you do?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, lots of things! The preceptor, Master Smith, is the queerest old fellow extant; just the sight of him sets me up to all sorts of pranks."</p> 
               <p>"I know him; he preaches here sometimes. He is a short, fat man, very nervous, shrugs and twitches about, and prays with his eyes wide open, always beginning, 'Almitty Gud.'"</p> 
               <p>"That is him to the life; what a mimic you are, Jessie. They say he has acquired so many languages that he has partly forgotten his own. Unquestionably, he is a very learned man, but one wholly unfit for a teacher. Most of his time is spent in poring over some ponderous tome, while his pupils are left to the care of his usher. Now and then he awakes to a sense of his responsibilities, and the way the old fellow then flies round is enough to set one into fits. It is impossible to refrain from mirth. The fellows would crack all sorts of jokes, and play hundreds of tricks at the old chap's expense, and whether I was in the scrape or not, I always had to bear a full share of the blame."</p> 
               <p>"If you had been a well-behaved, studious boy, you would not have suffered from injustice."</p> 
               <p>"Very true, Miss Wisdom, but I was quite the contrary. Then there were the frolics at the boarding-house. There were six of us at Deacon Green's, and the shines we cut were a caution."</p> 
               <p>"How bad you were! You must love to be punished!"</p> 
               <p>"No, that we didn't; but when a parcel of fellows get together they will have their fun."</p> 
               <p>"What did you call fun?"</p> 
               <p>"Many tricks; ringing Sambo for example."</p> 
                
               <p>"Ringing Sambo; who is Sambo?"</p> 
               <p>"It isn't a person, only a bell suspended from a frame in the yard at the deacon's, for the purpose of summoning the farm laborers and boarders to meals. One night, I tied a piece of black yarn round the bell, to which was attached a long, slender black cord; this was passed into the chamber window. As soon as the family had fallen asleep, old Sambo began to tinkle. There was a stir; louder rang old Sambo. The Deacon's bed-room window was raised; jingle, jingle, went the bell. 'Boys,' shouted the old gentleman, 'Let that bell alone and come in directly, or I'll skin every one of yer teeth.' I told the boys to hold; so after listening awhile, the Deacon shut the window, and returned to bed. As soon as we thought he was again snoozing, old Sambo was put in motion. A universal stir succeeded; again the Deacon angrily demanded what we meant. 'Come in, you darned, confounded rogues, or it will be the wus for ye.' I told the boys not to make such a pious man swear. The back door next opened; creeping to the window, I descried the old man searching for the bell ringers. As we kept whist, he soon came in and resought his pillow, but we did not permit him to lie long; jumping up, he called one of his men, and as I surmised that they were lighting a lantern, I snapped the yarn and drew in the cord. After a careful examination of the premises, the Deacon returned to the house; proceeding directly to our chamber, he held his lantern just above each of our noses, but every mother's son, of us was wrapt in the sweet sleep of innocence."</p> 
               <p>"What happened in the morning?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, the mystery could not be dispelled. Part of the family concluded, with the Deacon, that it was the boys; the other half sided with Nelly Bly, the cook, and religiously believed it to have been the witches."</p> 
               <p>I was much diverted; but reproved my companion for his wanton disregard of others' comfort for his own amusement. "It was a shame thus to disturb the old gentleman's rest. What happened next?"</p> 
               <p>"One of the boarders, a French lad from the West Indies, took Turk into the pasture, and he chased the sheep. The little scamp set him on, I know, but all I could get from the garon was: 'Turk did run after the mouton, and I did let him went!' Though the sheep were unhurt, and I wholly blameless, the Deacon vowed vengeance against me and my dog. Soon after, I was compelled to be the scape-goat on several other similar occasions. At last came the final wind-up. It had been a wild, stormy week, and a fire had been kept in the school-room. Friday afternoon, a scholar asked the loan of a few cents; without suspecting any trick, I handed out the money. About the middle of the session, there arose an intolerable stench of burning tobacco. The master had been more than commonly devoted to his books for several days; but tobacco was his aversion, and he was instantly aroused to a fierce spirit of castigation. Springing from his desk, he caught his cane, and flew about like a crazy man. I wish you could have seen his ridiculous figure as he poked the fire, then rushed amongst the desks, punching one, pulling another, pushing one here, and hauling another there, sputtering and stammering, his round eyes sticking from their sockets, and his fat cheeks puffed out red and irate. I could not refrain from laughing, and, quick as a flash, pictured out the old fellow on my slate. An immediate snicker in my vicinity caught the preceptor's attention; rushing up the aisle, he confiscated the slate, and hauled me to the culprit's<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6399-00000016"/> stand for judgment. It was proved that I had provided the money for the purchase of the tobacco, and it was believed that I had been the instigator of the whole affair. The mean dog who had originated the matter would not come forward to clear me, so I was obliged to father the whole. If Master Smith had ever taken the pains to have made his pupils' acquaintance, he would have known that I was never backward in confessing my sins, that he might have relied upon my honor and veracity; but as he knew no more about me than the man in the moon, justice could not be expected. I own, that I was excessively angry, and said what I ought not, but the master was as much to blame as his scholars. Uncle Sprague happened to arrive just in the mele, and he concluded to take me home with him. A few days after my return, Master Neal came to Boston, and it was decided to place me with him."</p> 
               <p>I shook my head. "Oh, Dwight, you are a sad trial; but is not the master terribly stern and severe, and isn't it a queer home for you?"</p> 
               <p>"Rather! But the old fellow's bark is worse than his bite. I know how to manage him, and the old girls, his sisters.</p> 
               <p>"But do you never feel homesick, lonely, and dispirited!"</p> 
               <p>A deep shade passed over my companion's expressive face, and in a tremulous tone he replied: "The One above only knows how truly miserable, how lonely in spirit, I really am. My only resource is to flee from thought, and rush into a frolic; but often when the surface is the gayest, the heart is the heaviest. I wonder why I have told you this, Jessie? I should never-have thus confided to another mortal! You and I have not met for the first time to-day; our souls have been communing for ages!"</p> 
               <p>With a stare of wonder, I gazed into my companion's abstracted face. Tuning, the dreamy look melted into one of roguish glee, which ended in a hearty laugh.</p> 
               <p>"Do forgive me Jessie, but you looked <emph>so</emph> puzzled!"</p> 
               <p>Scarcely relishing his banter, I took my basket and proceeded to gather nuts; but I was not permitted to go on. "My little hands should not be soiled." Unresistingly, I seated myself upon a stone as directed, and silently watched my companion, who alternately whistled and talked to his dog. At length the baskets were filled, and we turned homeward. Astonished, and somewhat shy of this new acquaintance, I proceeded in silence, till with a smile he asked, "what I was sermonizing about?"</p> 
               <p>Afraid to tell, and equally unable to frame an excuse, I blushed to the very roots of my hair, and retained a bashful silence.</p> 
               <p>With his roguish eyes still on mine, he added: "I know, so don't distress yourself; you are considering whether it is proper to cultivate my acquaintance. Don't quite consign me to oblivion. I mean to sow my wild oats, turn a new leaf, and make the world stare. Now, you don't believe me, but I mean it, and I can achieve any thing I undertake, Miss Wisdom! Where did you get that old head on young shoulders?"</p> 
               <p>"Where you should put your own," I laughingly replied, as we joined Job, who was driving home the cows for the night.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE OLD MAIDS NEAL, AND THE METHODIST MEETING.</head> 
               <p>I WAS loitering in my chamber the next morning, when Peggy's shrill tones summoned me below.</p> 
                
               <p>"Jest throw on the old lamb-skin cloak," said she, "and run into the old maid Neals and get our fine sieve. Aunt Judy borryed it t'other day, and I want to sift some flour."</p> 
               <p>Throwing the cloak over my head, I sallied forth.</p> 
               <p>The five maiden sisters, Neal, with their bachelor brother, the master, lived in an old-fashioned brown house, a little below the parsonage, on the other side of the road. I knocked at the door, which was partly open, but as no one appeared, I ventured to step forward. This entrance opened directly into the kitchen, a large, smoke-embrowned apartment. A few pieces of cheap crockery were set out upon a small round table near the fire, before which some Indian johnny-cakes were baking on pewter plates, supported by the tongs, which rested across the andirons; while six little coffee pots sizzled and steamed on as many little mounds of embers in the corner. I thought of the "six-and-twenty white pots, all in a row," and again knocked; but had time to note the homely, time-worn furniture, the shelf depending from the centre beam overhead, with its miscellaneous load, the pile of brush in a corner, and the other litter scattered about, ere any one answered my summons. Dwight was the first to enter. He was surprised to see me there at that hour, but said the old maids would be in directly; the cows were nearly milked.</p> 
               <p>Without further ceremony, he commenced turning the bannocks.</p> 
               <p>"You are quite handy, Dwight; did Aunt Judy tell you to turn them?"</p> 
               <p>"No; but I am not going to let them burn. We do not have such a variety of delicacies as to permit the spoiling of what we do get."</p> 
               <p>I laughed, for the close house-keeping of the sisters was proverbial, and asked, "Why they had so many small coffeepots?"</p> 
               <p>"Because their tastes differ. Aunt Judy likes strong coffee, sweetened with molasses in the pot; Aunt Nanny's must be weaker, sweetened with sugar in the cup; Aunt Susy being weakly, drinks strong old hyson tea; Aunt Liddy prefers young hyson; while Aunt Patience takes chocolate; the master purchases his own coffee, so he also has a separate pot."</p> 
               <p>Much diverted, I inquired what he drank.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I have a sip all round, just which I like. Variety is the spice of life. I get on charmingly; the old girls are trumps, and the master first-rate. There is nothing like knowing how to manage folks, Jessie."</p> 
               <p>At this instant, four of the sisters came in, bearing a foaming pail in either hand. Their ejaculations of surprise drew the invalid Aunt Susy from the adjoining bedroom, when a warm welcome ensued, coupled with much rejoicing over me.</p> 
               <p>"I was such a nice, tall gal for my age." "So like her Sir!" said one; "Jest the picture of her marra!" cried another; "Pretty Jessie Compton right over again!" chimed in the third. It was some minutes before I could explain my errand.</p> 
               <p>"Deary, Suz!" exclaimed Aunt Judy, "To think I should forgit that ere sieve, but I 'm e'en jest distraught. Here's brother been and invited Mr. Sam Stuart to preach his new-fangled religion here on Sunday evening I dunno what folks will say, but larned people like the master are apt to be free-thinkers, allers wants to dive into all sorts of heresies, instead of going by the catechism and covenant."</p> 
               <p>"Sam Stuart! Is he here?" I asked in surprise.</p> 
               <p>"Yes; brother and I went over to Mr. Prime's last night, and he comes in.<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6399-00000017"/> He couldn't get here in time to 'tend ye'r Grandsir's funeral, but now he has come clown to see his marm, and sell a load of butter and cheese."</p> 
               <p>"Is he to preach here next Sabbath night?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes; brother and he fell to talking, and brother invited him to preach. You tell your folks 'twant none of my doings. I feel awfully about it."</p> 
               <p>The cause of Aunt Judy's trepidation was a son of my step-grandmother by her first marriage. Studious and inquiring, his heart was not in his farming, and Grandma'am's property had not thriven under his care. Some years previous, he had received his inheritance and moved to Vermont, but with a large farm in that new state, he had scarcely made the two ends meet. Recently, he had enhanced the anxiety of his friends by becoming a convert to the new sect of Methodists. Uncle Sam Stuart in town to preach Methodism at the masters! This was news. Taking the sieve I hastened home to promulgate it.</p> 
               <p>The family were much surprised. The parson said Master Neal was an odd genius.</p> 
               <p>My aunt assented, adding: "And Mr. Stuart is of the same stamp. It is a pity he did not seek an education."</p> 
               <p>I intimated that I should like to hear Uncle Sam preach. The remark was received in silence. I ventured to add, "that James would be willing."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps so," she coldly replied." Times have changed; I wished to hear Whitefield when I was a girl."</p> 
               <p>"Did not you?".</p> 
               <p>"No; Parson Lowell would not admit him to his pulpit, and my father forbade me to attend his meetings. I decided to disobey him, however, and one evening actually started. At the first street corner, a voice commanded me to stop. I looked around, above, and on either hand; no one was near. I stepped forward. 'Go back,' repeated the voice. Trembling from head to foot, I paused. Want of resolution was not my failing in those days; again I proceeded. 'Go back, go back!' reiterated the voice, in such a decided, peremptory tone that I turned and fled home."</p> 
               <p>"Did you ever hear that voice again?"</p> 
               <p>"No,"</p> 
               <p>"Do you regard it as a supernatural interposition to keep you from evil?"</p> 
               <p>"I think it might have been."</p> 
               <p>"But, aunt, Whitefield must have declared much truth, or his doctrines could not have thus stirred the multitude. It was a pity for you to lose the opportunity to see and hear such a remarkable man, if for nothing but the remembrance."</p> 
               <p>Parson Noles laughed, said, "he believed I had got the best of the argument, if I was a little free-thinker; Aunt Compton must let me attend Mr. Stuart's meeting; it was as well that I should go first as last, as he clearly saw that I should never be satisfied till I heard him preach."</p> 
               <p>Peggy declared anybody might see the stock I sprung from: "the gal talked like a preacher herself."</p> 
               <p>I was somewhat abashed, fearing that I had been too forward; but Grandsir had always treated me as a companion, always encouraged me to talk freely; and this had often caused me to speak upon matters infrequent to one of my age.</p> 
               <p>Nothing more was said, however. The morning was spent in a close attendance upon my studies, under the parson's direction. In the afternoon, Aunt Compton claimed my assistance in stitching. As we sat alone together, I was in hopes she would again revert to the meeting, but she evaded any notice of the subject. My stint completed, I ran into the hall to meet Dwight, whom I had seen approaching. Catching my hand, he twirled me down to the farther end. Next he volunteered a new dance. "It is real pretty; I learned the figure the last time I was in Boston."</p> 
               <p>I complied, and the dancing commenced; but in a moment it was interrupted by a voice in the rear: "Hillo, what's this? That's capital. Why, I should think I had got back to France!"</p> 
               <p>Turning, whom should I espy but James, standing in the outer entrance.</p> 
               <p>With a cry of joy, I sprang to his embrace. This was affectionately returned, as he exclaimed: "Well, pet, you seem to be getting on pretty well: who is your partner?" I introduced Dwight.</p> 
               <p>"Haven't had time to be homesick; that's right. Where is Madam Compton? I should like to take you to South-end this evening."</p> 
               <p>My aunt was happy that I could have the pleasure. We were soon on our way. Much to my satisfaction, I found James had purchased the handsome horse.</p> 
               <p>I related my experiences since we parted, and begged James to interpose respecting the meeting. He promised compliance, said "I should get tired of it fast enough, but my curiosity ought to be satisfied."</p> 
               <p>I found that Aunt Nabby had her furniture nicely arranged. The house presented a strange mixture of unfamiliarity and homeishness. Uncle Sam had just returned from "Port"; he had disposed of his load, and purchased articles for home use.</p> 
               <p>Aunt Nabby was scolding about his extravagance. "Only think, Jessie, he's bought his wife a silk gownd, and Sally a blue bonnet. Now he wants me to iron him a white handkercher to preach in over to Master Neal's. A pooty preacher! I hope he wont have to borry money to take him home; and he must have cream toast, and white sugar in his tea. Grandma is a fool to cosset him so."</p> 
               <p>"He sings and prays beautifully," said Ruthy. "I wish you could hear the old warming-pan ring in the cellar way."</p> 
               <p>"Ring, how?"</p> 
               <p>"Why he hollers so it rings like anything."</p> 
               <p>"Hush, Ruthy, here are the Primes," exclaimed Aunt Nabby.</p> 
               <p>The male members of the family soon appeared, and joined the circle around the fire.</p> 
               <p>The conversation, as was the wont at that period, immediately turned upon politics. All were Federalists, with the exception of Uncle Sam. Aunt Nabby was the most zealous speaker. She declared, that "If Tom Jefferson was elected, Sabba' day would be done away, the meetin-houses all shut, and the French revolution would come right over again. Why, he puts the 'Age of Reason' afore the Bible, and Tom Paine above Christ."</p> 
               <p>"Jefferson is a great and learned man; he will not permit the union of church and state, that is your Hopkintonian hobby," retorted Uncle Sam. Aunt Nabby replied, that "It wouldn't hurt any state to be joined to true religion, and 't was a pity there wasn't some power to put down schismatics."</p> 
               <p>Uncle John covered this home-thrust by some funny reference to petticoat-government; while Mr. Prime declared, "Jefferson was in league with Bonaparte; we should have that Robert Spear to rule over us yet."</p> 
               <p>James exchanged an amused glance with Uncle Sam. "Come, Mr. Lee," exclaimed the latter, "what is your opinion of Mr. Prime's prediction."</p> 
               <p>"That Bonaparte will have plenty to occupy him in Europe; as I do not<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6399-00000018"/> believe in spirits walking, I do not dread the dead Robespierre."</p> 
               <p>"There, sir, I telled you Robert Spear was dead; now I hope you'll believe it, since Jim Lee's been to his country," outspoke Mrs. Prime.</p> 
               <p>A smile passed round the circle. "Robert Spear" had been Mr. Prime's pet bugbear; it was hard to give him up.</p> 
               <p>Eight o'clock struck. Mrs. Prime proceeded to knit to the middle of her seam-needle preparatory to rolling up work. I stole behind Uncle Sam, in a whisper requested him to pray and sing before we went. He turned and gazed fixedly into my face; seeing I was in earnest, he electrified the company by calling in a clear, solemn voice, "The Holy Spirit is among us, let us pray."</p> 
               <p>Taking my hand, he knelt and drew me beside him, then in a loud, emphatic tone commenced: "Holy Father, we thank Thee that out of the mouth of babes and sucklings, Thou hast perfected praise."</p> 
               <p>The impression was irresistible; each paused, then involuntarily assumed a reverential attitude. What devotion and fluency were displayed in that prayer! The tones were loud, so loud that the warming-pan rang an audible accompaniment; still there was nothing repugnant nor ludicrous. That strong, earnest spirit for the moment enchained the others, bore them with his own in fervent aspiration.</p> 
               <p>All, even Aunt Nabby, quietly seated themselves, as the petition was ended. Uncle Sam placed me on his knee, and in a powerful, melodious voice, sang a good hymn, set to an exhilarating tune. I was delighted, and thanked him warmly for gratifying my wish.</p> 
               <p>The gentleman evidently gave me credit for more spirituality than I deserved. With a warm kiss, he invoked the choicest blessing upon my head.</p> 
               <p>As we rode home, James inquired why I had asked Uncle Sam to pray.</p> 
               <p>"Ruthy had rendered me curious. What do you think of his religion?"</p> 
               <p>"I honor his sincerity, but his manner is too ear-splitting."</p> 
               <p>"Still, it is not ridiculous."</p> 
               <p>"Not in the least, Jessie, as the world counts; this preaching will prove a bad speculation for Uncle Sam; but I believe that, at last, he has found his true vocation."</p> 
               <p>Aunt Compton made no objection to my accompanying James to the master's, Sunday evening. Saturday night had been kept, the Sabbath observed; holy time had ended according to the Puritan code, which, reckoned by Mosaic time. "The evening and the morning were the first day."</p> 
               <p>The house was crowded. Mr. Stuart was at prayer on our entrance. Dwight squeezed me into a corner beside himself. The irreverent lad was rapidly sketching the assembly.</p> 
               <p>In the foreground stood the preacher, with raised hands and closed eyes. On his right, peered up a little old woman, with an eager, cynical visage; to the left, came a broad-faced girl, with wide-open mouth and eyes; beyond, a fat man was nodding in desperate efforts to resist the drowsy god; in front, a tall, wiry fellow gaped in wondering attention; the picture was filled with other figures in divers expression and attitude.</p> 
               <p>As the artist had covered his paper, after the singing of a hymn, I was at leisure to listen to the sermon; but to one uninterested in the discussion of minor points of doctrine, it was wholly devoid of interest. As James had predicted, I soon became exceedingly weary. My companion proposed an escape by a back-door; I gladly acceded. The transition from the close room to the clear, autumn night air was refreshing.</p> 
                
               <p>"What does Uncle Sam mean by falling from grace, Dwight?" I asked, as we turned up the hill.</p> 
               <p>"Sinning when you don't mean to, I suppose. I have a personal knowledge of that moral infirmity. But, Jessie, such a performance as this we have left, would never make me better. I can appreciate the motives of both speaker and audience, but its ludicrous elements completely overmaster every other sentiment. Now, alone with you, on this hill-top, with this starry canopy above, this tranquil beauty around, my better nature awakes. Solitude and nature have ever been my best soul-teachers. I seldom feel serious in any place of worship. Sometimes the morning service in King's Chapel proves an exception. It is a grand, solemn pile; at times, the rich tones of the reader, the responses of the congregation, the pealing organ, and swelling music of the chants, take hold of my spiritual sense; I can bow reverently, with the heartfelt acknowledgment that the Lord Gorl, Jehovah reigneth, blessed be His holy name."</p> 
               <p>"I should like to go to that church," I answered, in a suppressed voice, for my companion's air of reverence had impressed me with unusual awe.</p> 
               <p>"I hope to take you there some day; hope to seat you in my mother's place in the old pew."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you." Why was this so falteringly spoken? why did my heart beat such a wild refrain? In tremulous wonder, I walked on in silence. This was broken by the declaration from Dwight that my Cousin James was a handsome man: "You love him dearly?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes; he has always been like an I elder brother."</p> 
               <p>"A brother? well keep him in that relation."-"I assuredly intend to." I had now reached the parsonage gate; with a quiet good-night, the lad passed on to the brow of the hill.</p> 
               <p>Where was he going? I watched till his lithe form was hidden in the shadow; cautiously tiptoeing forward, to my dismay, I saw him disappear within the sombre pile. The idea of visiting the empty building at this hour was frightful to my childish mind. What a strange youth this was!</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THANKSGIVING AND THE SPINNING BEE.</head> 
               <p>THANKSGIVING was approaching. Increased activity pervaded every domicile. The last remnant of harvesting must be completed, and preparation made for the long, cold winter close at hand. Within was equal bustle. The cheese must be carried to the cellar, the dairy and its utensils thoroughly scoured, the rest of the house put to rights.</p> 
               <p>Miss Lane was employed to make our homespun woollen gowns, and Tailor Thurril came to replenish Job's winter wardrobe. Peggy huffed and snarled over kettles of apple-sauce and pots of preserved quinces; then came the baking of pumpkin-pies, cranberry tarts, and loaves of plum cake.</p> 
               <p>There was to be our usual family gathering at South-end, and an evening party at Mrs. Prime's in honor of James' return.</p> 
               <p>Dwight, somewhat to my relief, went to Boston to pass the holidays.</p> 
               <p>The afternoon preceding the festival, Miss Betty Bradshaw, a cousin of Aunt Compton, arrived at the parsonage. For many years it had been her custom to pass the day with her relative. She was a maiden between fifty and sixty, still personally attractive, exceedingly agreeable, and possessed of<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6399-00000019"/> an independent fortune. The youngest of four sisters, her childhood was like a summer's day, till the terrible throat distemper, that converted so many New England households into a Ramah of mourning, brought death and desolation. Only Betty survived. The shock was too much for Madam Bradshaw; her reason became shattered, and she settled into a moody, quiet creature, devoted to her remaining child. She lived many years, and it was touching to see the poor woman leading about her womanly daughter as if she had still been a little girl.</p> 
               <p>Miss Betty rejected every suitor during her mother's life, feeling that she required her entire care; after that, she declared herself too old and ugly for matrimony, and resided with her maid-servant in the house that had been her father's, in the neighboring town. Her life, however, was neither secluded nor useless. A large circle of friends always welcomed Miss Betty with peculiar cordiality; the children esteemed her as their best friend. If a quilt was to be drawn, a pocket or petticoat worked, or picture stretched, Miss Betty must superintend the matter. Many a heart did she gladden, and many a hearth was made happier by her presence.</p> 
               <p>It had been decided that I should dine in my new home, but I was to take tea at South-end, and attend the party in the evening.</p> 
               <p>Aunt Compton herself, arranged my dress for the occasion. This was an unlooked-for attention which 1 duly appreciated. My black silk she trimmed with some of her rich lace. James brought the new brooch (Grandma'am's present). After it was fastened, my aunt clasped a heavy gold necklace around my throat. Tears were in her eyes, as she said, "This was my other daughter's, my other Jessie's last birthday present."</p> 
               <p>As I pressed my lips to hers, I felt hat she had phrased her words aright; that we were as mother and daughter to each other.</p> 
               <p>The merry afternoon at South-end glided all too soon. Tea over, James, Ruthy, and I repaired to Mr. Prime's. The company were beginning to assemble. As became my age, I sought an obscure corner, but Mrs. Prime drew me forth, and placed me beside the most distinguished guest,-a young lady from Haverhill.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Prime, a rigid, bigoted man, was a great abhorrer of amusement in any form; he and Aunt Nabby were in the habit of holding long harangues upon the sins of fiddling and promiscuous dancing; but pretty Debby Prime, the only daughter, had obtained her will, and the fiddler soon appeared and took his stand, back to the fire.</p> 
               <p>A colloquy with a group of young men having been held, James came and inquired, "If I could lead with him in the new dance Dwight had taught me."</p> 
               <p>I thought I could.</p> 
               <p>"Very well; then we can teach the others," and he led me to the top of the room.</p> 
               <p>As the set formed, I overheard the Haverhill lady, who stood next, inquire, "What that little chit was to open the dance for?"</p> 
               <p>"That is the great heiress, Jessie Bradshaw," was the reply. "Her partner is the famous travelled gentleman, Mr. Lee; he is her cousin and guardian; evidently he intends to be something more in time, but there will be plenty of aspirants for her hand; she will be a great catch for somebody."</p> 
               <p>Unfortunate words! words,-nothing but ball-room chatter, yet how they sank into my heart, how for long years they poisoned my existence!</p> 
               <p>I glanced at my unconscious vis-a-vis, and blushed painfully. I knew why I was in that conspicuous position. I knew my cousin's noble, uncalculating character. Still, the tares were sown, thenceforth to grow, rank and norious in my soul.</p> 
               <p>Jonas Prime, a burly clodhopper, claimed my hand for the next set. I was sufficiently versed in politeness to know that I must not slight my host's son. The next partner was more agreeable; my hand was solicited for every dance, and I received a profusion of compliments and attention. Suddenly, I found myself the belle, the heiress. Bitter, bitter words! never to know whether I was sought for myself or my money. Not a particle of vanity was roused at the sensation produced; humbled with a slight scorn for my kind, I turned from the revelry, glad to know that I had secured an abiding place in the bosom of my grief-stricken, reticent aunt. On the Thursday following Thanksgiving, occurred the annual spinning bee. At an early hour, a fire was kindled in the great back chamber, the manufactory of the family; here were the loom, woollen, linen and spooling wheels, reel, swift, and warping bars. Soon several teams arrived, bringing the girls' linen wheels. Their fair owners quickly followed. The spacious work-room shortly resounded with the buzz of industry and the tongues of the lively maidens.</p> 
               <p>Meantime, the young men had repaired, to the parish wood-lot to cut and haul the year's firing.</p> 
               <p>Dinner was served at separate tables, but the young people met at tea. The skeins having been counted, much to my pride it was found that Ruthy had surpassed her companions, consequently was declared queen of the bee.</p> 
               <p>Tea over, the parson invited the elder and more serious portion to join him in the library; the others made merry in the kitchen.</p> 
               <p>Dwight ran home for his fife; this, with the voices of the girls, served for several dances. "Spinning the plate," "blind man's buff," "fox and geese," were next introduced. The fun and racket had reached their climax, when the door opened, and old Uron, the lame pedler, stumped in. He was received with a shout of welcome.</p> 
               <p>"Good evening, masters and misses, good e'en to ye," squeaked the old man, as he seated himself before the fire and, began to untie bag and bundle. "Here's tapes, pins, needles, sewing-silk, black sewing-silk, all colors, almanacs and sarmons. Here's the sarmon preached at the funeral of Mr. Prince, the blind minister; Fast and 'lection sermons, the confession of the pirates that was hung in Boston, and varses on the death of Eliza Fales, that was killed by her beau, Jason Fair-banks,-beautiful varses, with a sweet, pooty border of black coffins. Here's Jack, the Piper, Whittington, and his Cat, Pilgrim's Progress, The Children in the Wood, Bank of Faith, The Prompter, or the Man Coming out at the Little End of the Horn, the History of the Devil, and a great many other religious books."</p> 
               <p>"Give us the History of the Devil," shouted one. "I want the pirate's confession," interposed another. "Joe, buy me the verses with the 'sweet, pooty coffin border,'" said Ruthy, to a handsome young fellow that had been especially attentive to her through the evening.</p> 
               <p>I demanded "The Prompter," thinking that if its hero came out of the little end of the horn, it might be a suitable present for Dwight, as I wished to make him some requital for the handsome "Robinson Crusoe" he had brought me on his return from Boston.</p> 
               <p>Aunt Compton came to purchase silks for my sampler, Peggy replenished her needle-case, and there was a jocular exchange of trifles throughout the company<pb n="36" xml:id="VAC6399-00000020"/> pany. Dwight received my gift with a low bow, and expressed his gratitude in a speech that elicited the cheers of the party.</p> 
               <p>"What caused your lameness, Mend?" he demanded as the pedler was retying bag and bundle.</p> 
               <p>"I was killed jest as my brother was."</p> 
               <p>The lad's eyes dilated. "Indeed,-how was that?"</p> 
               <p>"Tree fell on us, killed my brother stark dead, and me jest like him. He died, and I lived."</p> 
               <p>"So I see, you're pretty lively, for a killed man."</p> 
               <p>"Peggy, hand on the flip, this good fellow must have a drop to warm up, before he goes."</p> 
               <p>Peggy pulled forth the loggerhead that had been heating in the bright coals, and in a moment the silver tankard was steaming full of the beverage. Nuts and apples having been handed round, as the clock had struck nine, it was declared time for dispersion. The company were ushered to the parlor, where after a short prayer from Parson Noles, and the singing of "Old Hundred," the guests bade us good night, Dwight escorting the pedler to the master's, where he proposed to sleep.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE DISTRICT SCHOOL.</head> 
               <p>THE next Monday, the winter term of the district school commenced. This was usually under the sway of Master Neal. During the summer, he taught a private school in his own house.</p> 
               <p>As South-end was in the next district, I had never been his pupil. Dwight, though a private student, prepared to attend this term. He offered to be my escort the first morning,-a kindness which my aunt gladly accepted.</p> 
               <p>As the school-house was at a distance, the snow deep, and there was only an hour's intermission, my aunt decided that I should take my dinners.</p> 
               <p>Peggy took one of her egg baskets, into which she carefully packed several slices of bread and corned beef. "You shall have a sassage when the hogs are killed; they are nice to carry to school," said she, as she stepped into the pantry. "Now, what sort of pie do you want?"</p> 
               <p>I preferred mince; but had found that Dwight's maxim respecting managing people was very effectual with Peggy</p> 
               <p>Just let her think she was always having her own way, and you could lead her whithersoever you would; so I had the policy to reply: "Just what you please, Peggy."</p> 
               <p>"Well, then I'11 cut a mince; children allers loves mince, and you shall have some plum cake; here are some pieces for Dwight, too, 'taint what he gets every day I warrent. You shall have some doughnuts and fried applesarse turnovers to-morrow, if I get through washing in good season."</p> 
               <p>"O, don't trouble yourself, Peggy."</p> 
               <p>"'Taint no trouble, child. It is hard enuff to go to school, to the Master specially, without going with mean vittles. I'll look out for you, too, Dwight, if you take good care of our leetle gal; you must be een-jest starved on Aunt Judy's allowance."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, no I get along pretty well, though it is not as if I lived with you, Peggy. Aunt Judy has been quite flush lately; bakes me dropkin cakes very often."</p> 
               <p>"She does, laws sakes, what has come over her! what will happen next?"</p> 
               <p>"I guess I shall run off with the old

                   girl some day. Don't you think she must have fallen in love with me?"</p> 
               <p>Peggy thought something must have happened, for Aunt Judy to bestir herself to bake drop, or as she termed them, dropkin cakes, for such a jackanapes.</p> 
               <p>Bidding Peggy to mind how she miscalled people, Dwight gallantly took my basket and satchel, and we sallied forth.</p> 
               <p>It was a clear, cold morning; smoke wreaths curled cosily up from the scattered farm-houses. The cattle and sheep had grouped themselves in the sunshine, under the lee of barns and walls, while from the woods came the busy drum of the woodpecker and the cheery caw of crows.</p> 
               <p>Our path led by a small, one-storied house, owned and occupied by Sexton Sloper. As we drew near, his wife came forth, with the hood of her brown cloak drawn round her face, and a bunch of yarn in her hand.</p> 
               <p>"There is the witch," said Dwight. "I am going to put this piece of silver in the path, to see if she cannot pass it, as Peggy and Aunt Judy assert."</p> 
               <p>I begged him to refrain, but my words were useless; my escort was firmly bent upon trying the experiment. The coin was dropped, and though I fain would have hurried on, I was detained to Witness the effect of the manuvre.</p> 
               <p>I suppose the shrewd woman had seen Dwight stoop to drop the four-pence. From the position in which the world had placed her, she would naturally be suspicious, on the outlook for tricks; so, after passing us with a courtsey and good-day, she went slowly forward, carefully scanning the path.</p> 
               <p>The coin was quickly espied. Picking it up she called to Dwight, that he had lost some money.</p> 
               <p>"Don't it burn your fingers, Goody?" he laughingly Returned. "You may keep it to pay my passage to one of those night meetings, for a ride on your broomstick the next stormy night, as I want to join that dance of witches, and make the acquaintance of the piper."</p> 
               <p>The Goody grinned, and told him he was a knowing lad; she guessed he had got enough of the piper in him already. Then lifting her disengaged hand, and pointing her long, bony fore-finger at me, in a slow, solemn, impressive tone, she added:" Beware, Miss Jessie! the path is very bright now, but an hour hence the shadows will fall across it, and there are holes and slippery places beyond. Such will be your life; many a bitter hour is in store. The one beside you will cause many a heart-ache. The world is a weary place. It will prove just as much so to the beautiful young heiress as to the poor old witch."</p> 
               <p>I was terribly frightened! Dwight did not lessen this terror by shouting, "Hold your tongue, you infernal old hag. Say what you will to me, but let Jessie alone, she is finding what the world and its contents are fast enough, without you scaring her out of it."</p> 
               <p>"That's a brave lad!" returned the witch, "Always stand by her, and I'll speak a good word for you," she continued, nodding with a sibyllic grin that I thought most diabolical, as she turned and proceeded up the road.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Dwight, how could you talk so to the Goody! I do so wish you had let her alone," I whispered, as she disappeared round a curve of the highway.</p> 
               <p>"Why, she was not offended."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps not, but such people have so much cunning there is no knowing what they may do."</p> 
               <p>My companion turned a quick, searching look at my paleface; "Surely a girl of your sense cannot believe in witches?" Seeing that I could scarcely stand, he gently drew my hand in his,<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6399-00000022"/> and with soothing tenderness strove to allay my terror.</p> 
               <p>Shiver after shiver crept over me, as with trembling steps I faltered forward. Why should I disbelieve in witches? I had never been taught to do so, on the contrary, perfect faith in their presence and malignity, was a popular household doctrine, forming a part of the received theology of the period. In every domicile, I saw horse-shoes hung above the doors, and similar charms to intercept satanic influences; why should I be less superstitious than others? I therefore drew nearerto Dwight, returning his look by one thoroughly dubious.</p> 
               <p>"Why, Jessie, I really did not think that you was so credulous! That woman is to be feared if her enmity is aroused, but not on account of any supernatural power. The world, misunderstanding her powerful but eccentric character, has dubbed her with the cognomen of witch. She must bear the stigma, therefore is determined to make the most of it. I really like the sorceress, and mean to gain her heart to counterpoise Aunt Judy's. Once your friend, and she is one to stick close as a brother; to go through fire and water to render service. She meant nothing by what she said to you, so be a brave girl and shake off this fear. You must never dread anything when I am by, my dear, little Miss Wisdom if I am to cause so many heart-aches."</p> 
               <p>I laughed, released my hand, and with proper sauciness, replied, "That he need not flatter himself upon that prediction, that I was sure Goody Sloper could not be a true witch, for naming such a silly prophecy."</p> 
               <p>A long, low whistle, succeeded by a thoughtful, melancholy look, was reply. After a moment's silence escort inquired "If I was such a distinguished heiress as the witch had intimated?"</p> 
               <p>"Did not you know it?"</p> 
               <p>"No, indeed, I never thought whether you was rich or poor; I am not give such inquiries. I have seen that you are careless of money; I suppose for are rich enough to prevent anxiety respecting pecuniary matters.</p> 
               <p>"I! I am as poor as a church-mouse; lave scarcely sufficient for my education, if I go to the university."</p> 
               <p>"I thought you had chosen a mercantile life."</p> 
               <p>"I do not know, I hate trade,-bargaining and money-getting are my detestation. So I have the supreme honor of attending the loveliest heiress in the region. I hope I shall sufficiently appreciate the favor."</p> 
               <p>"I wish that you were ignorant that I possessed one cent!" I exclaimed with a fervor that astonished the lad; but the words in the dancing-room rang in my ears.</p> 
               <p>"Why?" was the laughing rejoinder, "I sha'nt like you the less!"</p> 
               <p>"Of course not! How much has this information raised me in your esteem? Oh, it is so hard never to know whether you, or your money is the best loved. I hate the very sound of heiress! How I wish I could grow poor!"</p> 
               <p>Dwight gazed at me in surprise; my vehemence astonished him." Why, Jessie, how bitter you are; you surely do not believe that I shall think more highly of your money than yourself;</p> 
               <p>1 really love you less, now that I know of this fortune, than I did before?"</p> 
               <p>I shook my head. "If any body is disinterested, I think you are, Dwight; but self-knowledge is hard to secure: we are all selfish beings!"</p> 
               <p>Dwight laughed, declaring "me the funniest girl in creation." He wondered how wise that little head would get at "twenty."</p> 
               <p>The school-house at this moment came in view; a small, brown structure, at the angle of two cross roads, a hot, unsheltered spot in summer, bleak and bare in winter.</p> 
               <p>Huge smoke billows were issuing from the low, broad chimney. Entering the open door, we passed through a small entry to a large, low, smoke embrowned apartment beyond.</p> 
               <p>A fire of green logs was steaming and sputtering in the stone fire-place which occupied two-thirds of the lower end; the teacher's desk filling the remainder of the space; in front, tier above tier, rose a series of clumsy, unpainted desks, much hacked and knotted by the knives of their various occupants.</p> 
               <p>On the hearth, around the smoking fire, were grouped some fifteen boys, and about half as many girls. Most were strangers to me, as well as to Dwight. I had seen them at meeting, but had not even a speaking acquaintance with but one scholar. This was a fair, pink-cheeked girl, with a beautiful plump figure, little pearly teeth, and light flossy ringlets. She was the daughter of Squire Norton, with whose family ours had always been on visiting terms. As this young lady was older than myself, I had never held much intercourse with her. Now, however, she rose with a cordial good-morning; I returned the salutation, and introduced my companion.</p> 
               <p>"You had better keep on your wrapper, it is so chilly here," she said, as she handed my hood to a tall, buxom girl, who was deliberately eyeing us from head to foot; directing her to hang it in the entry next hers.</p> 
               <p>"La, Ann Norton, who was your waiter last year?" she exclaimed, placing her hands behind her with a look of derision.</p> 
               <p>Dwight, who had been regarding my beautiful acquaintance, with surprised admiration took the hood from her delicate hand, and with a low bow, begged to put it in the place designated.</p> 
               <p>"You don't know which nail belongs to Ann Norton," pertly interposed the tall miss, as he stepped into the entry.</p> 
               <p>"Angels appear in celestial blue, and Hebes in roseate red," returned the consummate flatterer, as with an arch glance, he hung my black hood between two which were of those colors.</p> 
               <p>"Goodness, gracious, scholars of the meetin-us district, mind your Fs and Q's, for pity's sake, for you've nothing less than Goody Sloper's familiar among you!" shouted the loud-toned lassie, as she clapped her red hands with great gusto. Ann sank gracefully back into her former seat, the bench in the corner, and in a languid tone begged her schoolmate "not to be so boisterous." Dwight's eyes were again resting upon her with his first look of admiration, when a slight shiver and soft complaint of cold from the beauty aroused all his activity.</p> 
               <p>"Shut that door, boys, why, what are you thinking about? Bring some of that dry wood from the entry; give me the bongs, you little tow-pate." Ordering this one here and another there, with the aid of the kindling wood, and dint of much poking and fussing, the fire was at length aroused to a sufficient activity to produce a slight degree of warmth.</p> 
               <p>It was amusing to see how Dwight made himself master of ceremonies. A stranger among scholars, many of whom were men grown, he immediately took; he direction of affairs as though he lad been Lord of the Manor,-a situation which was freely accorded till his last scholastic hour in their midst.</p> 
               <p>The master now made his appearance,-a signal for perfect silence.</p> 
               <p>After naming our seats, he ascended his desk. I was placed behind Ann Norton, immediately in front of the hoydenish Polly Brown. Dwight gave me my basket and satchel, then re<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6399-00000023"/> treated to his seat, the upper desk at the opposite side of the room.</p> 
               <p>Thump, thump, went the master's formidable ruler, upon his clumsy, oak desk. Every sound became hushed, every eye was concentrated on Master Neal.</p> 
               <p>"First class, come to read," was the first authoritative command.</p> 
               <p>Having always been accustomed to have the morning session opened with prayer, I was somewhat disconcerted, and knew not what to do. Peggy informed me at night, "That the master was too much of an old infidel to ever pray in school, but that he had such a powerful deal of laming that folks didn't mind it."</p> 
               <p>"You are in this class, Miss Jessie Bradshaw; bring your Bible and take your place next Master Dwight Sprague," said the master in a wonderfully gentle and polite tone.</p> 
               <p>I tremulously took the place designated in the long line that had ranged themselves in a row facing the teacher's desk. I was glad to get near the fire, for my teeth were chattering from the cold.</p> 
               <p>"Open to the first chapter in Genesis," directed the master. "Miss Jessie, the parson tells me you are an excellent reader; be so good as to read over the chapter,-the rest will follow and profit by the example." What could the man mean? I read that whole chapter for an example! I, the youngest and smallest of the class. I stared at the master with the idea that he must be demented.</p> 
               <p>"Commence, my dear."</p> 
               <p>The idea of Master Neal calling anybody, my dear I He really meant that I should obey his bidding. I was perfectly aghast, ready to faint.</p> 
               <p>Dwight kindly interposed, "I was timid and a stranger. Could not I be excused? He would read the chapter."</p> 
               <p>"Hold your peace, jackanapes; who cares for jour reading, Master Egotist! Come, Miss Jessie."</p> 
               <p>I had been told that the master's laws were like the Medes' and Persians', and there was a decision in his tone that I was not disposed to resist, so after a pause to collect my faculties, I courageously began my task. The first few words were low and faltering, but as I advanced, the beauty of the inspired text took such possession of my soul that I forgot my timidity, even my situation. I had read this chapter many times before, but in a careless, thoughtless manner, without appreciating the glorious theme.</p> 
               <p>"Very well, indeed. I see the parson was right. I hope you will all profit by Miss Jessie's very feeling rendering of this admirable composition, especially. Master Dwight," said the master, as his eyes rested with a peculiar glance upon my neighbor, I did not understand then. Afterward, I knew that the presumptous lad had, the day previous, held a long discussion with his preceptor on the truth of the Mosaic revelation.</p> 
               <p>The class having gone through the chapter, verse by verse, while I was graciously permitted to stand and listen, we were dismissed again to our seats.</p> 
               <p>The master, having collected our quills, seated himself to make pens, while the first class busied themselves in ruling the first page of their blank copy-books. Lead pencils are a later invention; their place, at that period, was supplied by a plummet of lead; these were of home-made manufacture, and moulded in various forms to suit the taste of the owner. Mine was something like a miniature lance; others resembled axes, chisels, etc.</p> 
               <p>The pens made and copies set, writing commenced, and the master turned his attention to the junior classes.</p> 
               <p>A page covered, the writing materials als were put aside, and the girls received permission to go out. I was thankful for the opportunity to warm my benumbed feet and hands. In a few moments the authoritative ruler remanded us to our seats. Next came the boys' recess, after which arithmetic and spelling closed the morning's exercises.</p> 
               <p>The master having shaken the little flaxen-haired urchin that Dwight had so unceremoniously enlisted into his services, nearly out of his skin, for mutilating the orthography of divers words on the first page of old "Webster," the big ruler thumped the welcome signal for dismissal.</p> 
               <p>The large boys and part of the girls returned home; those that remained gathered about the fire with their dinner-baskets.</p> 
               <p>"Halloo!" shouted the great Polly Brown, as Ann Norton produced a piece of boiled souse: "Here's an angel, a celestial, blue angel, feeding on pig's trotters! Why, only honey and metheglin should pass the pearly bars of that ruby portal!"</p> 
               <p>"Hear, hear!" screamed Dr. Evans' black-eyed Sally, above the shouts of laughter; "Polly Brown is growing poetical,"</p> 
               <p>"Tell us Cat Skin, Polly," implored a little girl.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, yes, tell us Cat Skin," cried at chorus of voices.</p> 
               <p>"I can't; I want to eat my dinner. Let me have a piece of your cranberry pie. Sally, and I will give you some of this sage cheese; it is uncommon good, considering who made it."</p> 
               <p>"Did you make it, Poll?"</p> 
               <p>"I helped."</p> 
               <p>"That means yes, to my question, here's the pie."</p> 
               <p>"Let me just taste, Sally," "and me" "and me," echoed half a dozen voices.</p> 
               <p>"Here, take it, it's nothing remarkable: stop, let me divide it equally."</p> 
               <p>"But, Polly, you are robbing yourself."</p> 
               <p>"No, I don't care for it, there is enough more where this came from."</p> 
               <p>"We've plenty of cheese, but I wanted to taste yours, Polly, and it is splendid," said one; "elegant," exclaimed a second;" better than marm's by a long chalk," chimed in a third.</p> 
               <p>Receiving her honors with due meekness, Miss Polly mounted to the top of the master's desk, and busied herself with her viands.</p> 
               <p>There was a short silence. Ann, having finished her dinner, leaned her pretty head against the jamb, in one of those graceful attitudes which were so natural to her. Polly, having also disposed of her eatables, lifted up her voice, with her eyes fixed in a ludicrously languishing expression, she sang in a tone that would have filled a cathedral: <q>

                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>This parody upon the then new and popular song of "What can the matter be," was received with shouts of applause.</p> 
               <p>"Sing another, Polly," clamored her companions. "Don't," begged Ann, in her soft, languid tone, "you will split my head with such a racket."</p> 
               <p>"Poor dear, she's narves," whispered Polly, with a dolorous air, then in a rich, clear voice she commenced.</p>

               <p>"Hurrah! the boys are going to slide down hill. Hurrah, for a coast!" Jumping from her elevated seat at one bound, Polly was at the door.</p> 
               <p>"Stop her, do stop her, girls!" urged Ann, with unwonted animation. "Do think what you are about, Polly. It is a shame for you to make such a Tomboy of yourself, besides bringing disgrace on all the girls of this district."</p> 
               <p>Polly, who had mounted the woodpile in the entry, at this juncture, placing her hand to her mouth screamed, Hear, hear! the beautiful and refined Squire's darter is making a speech, really deigning to instruct Lieutenant Brown's vulgar Polly." Springing her perch with the agility of a cat, and bareheaded, she darted across an intervening meadow in a twinkling, catching his sled rope from little Job Turner, the orthographical delinquent, and snatching his geometrically divided cap of red and blue, which rose like a candle extinguisher, steeple-crowned, from his white head, she drew it over her own bushy locks, and with lightning-like rapidity darted up the hill.</p> 
               <p>"What a Judy she is," said one amidst the group around the school-house door. "My marm would whip me soundly if I was to go out there among the boys," said another.</p> 
               <p>"Polly would be more likely to thrash her mother than her mother Polly," said Sally Evans; "she does just as she pleases, but father says the right stuff is in her, that she will make a first-rate woman."</p> 
               <p>As Polly bore off little Job's property, the bewildered lad glanced amazedly at his hand, then felt of his head, and as the reality of his despoilment became realized, and cold wind blew about his ears, a distressed look passed over the childish face which ended in his thrusting a blue mitten into each eye as he lifted up his voice to weep. Dwight, who had been coming down the road, had witnessed the whole of Polly's escapade; as might be expected he was highly diverted. Jumping the wall he shouted, "Capital, capital," calling me to join him and share his sled. As I did not advance, he came over to where I was standing, inquiring why I did not come.</p> 
               <p>"Why, I should be ashamed to be a rude girl. What would Aunt Comp-ton say? and James would pronounce me a regular Tom-boy."</p> 
               <p>"Madam Compton is too sensible to keep you cooped up in that freezing room, and James is too much of a traveller to be fastidious in such things. Why, do you suppose I would urge you to an impropriety? This reluctance is sheer prudery; that girl is fifty years before the age. Our granddaughters will all have their sleds, their grand-ma'am may as well take her share of sport now she can."</p> 
               <p>I laughed, and half convinced, followed the prophet with Polly's hood, saying that at any rate I would restore poor little Job's cap.</p> 
               <p>Before we reached the foot of the hill, Polly was at the summit. Erect with peaked cap, and strong lithe figure, she was a study for an artist.</p> 
                
               <p>Isn't she superb!" enthusiastically exclaimed my companion, "that Ann Norton is a perfect angel, but this girl has more soul in her little finger than a dozen such beauties."</p> 
               <p>"But Polly is so rude!" I interposed.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, but the other is so insipid; not but what I could gaze at her for hours, just as I would at a lovely picture, but this girl is a study with her dignity and spirit. Who is she?"</p> 
               <p>"Lieutenant Jed. Brown's daughter."</p> 
               <p>"What, the spreeing old Revolutionary officer?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Lieut. Jed is really a superior man, but he went into the army when a mere boy; volunteered in the enlistment after the battle of Lexington, and remained in service during the war. His whole soul is wrapped in a military life; he understands nothing else. Aunt Compton says the army unfitted many for civilians. Mrs. Brown is a weak-minded woman, slack and discouraged. Aunt Compton sent them pies and meat at Thanksgiving."</p> 
               <p>"Miss Polly is not put down by that," replied Dwight. "She will patronize you wherever you may meet, if you are an heiress."</p> 
               <p>I laughed, and as we had overtaken the bewailing Job, I threw Polly's hood over his head, and forcibly grasping one hand, I dragged him much against his will, with me up the hill.</p> 
               <p>"Here comes the faithless lover," Polly shouted, as she espied Dwight. "He has left his celestial, blue angel to pine in the chimney-corner over green logs, while he sports on the hill side with the roseate Hebe!"</p> 
               <p>"Give this boy his cap, you harum-scarum witch," returned Dwight.</p> 
               <p>"Poor, little monkey; did his tiny-tonty ears tingle?" she exclaimed, as she pulled the cap from her head and thrust it upon the urchin's, hauling it down over his nose; and, tying her own hood on back-side foremost, she seated herself upon the sled; then pulling the struggling Job into her lap, with a whoop and hurrah, they glided down the hill.</p> 
               <p>"Come," said Dwight, as he prepared to follow. It was a sore temptation, but propriety would have gained the ascendency had not Dwight, with gentle force, drawn me on the sled before him; in an instant, we were gliding down the long slope. As Polly had said, it was capital, and I could not resist taking a few more slides. Propriety was knocking loudly for re-entrance, however, but I grew so warm and bright, felt so much better for the exhilarating exercise, that it was a real pleasure only to stand and breathe the clear, cold air; but as some of the older boys appeared, I returned to the school-house.</p> 
               <p>Ann seemed shocked at my conduct, but the other girls, when they saw how fresh and warm I was, and heard a description of the sport, were inclined to take my part.</p> 
               <p>Ann said she never took the trouble to argue, and that heiresses were privileged mortals: of course they could branch off into any eccentricity they choose; it would only set the fashion for others to follow."</p> 
               <p>This was a new phase of the case; was it true? If so, I ought to be extremely circumspect. Dear, dear, this was part of the responsibility James spoke of, I supposed. Oh, me! what a bore it was to be so conspicuous a personage; but I would try to do my duty.</p> 
               <p>I was roused from these reflections by the entrance of the master, and the commencement of the afternoon exercises. The first class was called to read in the "American Preceptor"; the remainder of the afternoon was, devoted to arithmetic, ciphering on a slate, then<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6399-00000025"/> copying rules and sums into a manuscript book, provided for the purpose. This, as well as the copy-books, were of home manufacture; a quire of foolscap stitched together, and supplied with strong brown-paper covers.</p> 
               <p>The master having heard the classes in the Testament, Dillworth's spelling-book, and the primer, seated himself while they conned their spelling lessons. Now and then his assistance was required in a sum, or a pen was handed for repair; though thus engaged, his lynx eyes kept a sharp lookout, and woe to the delinquent, whether large or small.</p> 
               <p>Through the day, Dwight had steadily pursued his studies. I was just thinking this might be the beginning of that new leaf which he was always promising, when, with a prodigious yawn, books and slate were suddenly cast aside; languidly leaning his head upon his hand, he cast a dreamy look over the school-room till his gaze became concentrated on Ann Norton, who, all unconscious of this observation, was copying, in a neat, ladylike hand, the first rule from "Pike's Arithmetic." After a ten minutes' survey, a sheet of paper was abducted from his sum-book, and he began to work assiduously.</p> 
               <p>Half an hour elapsed. From the frequent quick glances to our seat, thence to his paper, I was certain he was not only sketching my pretty neighbor, but that the drawing was nearly complete. I think the master, who had watched the lad as narrowly as myself, was of a like opinion. For some moments, lie had been poising and balancing the ponderous ruler in Dwight's direction; suddenly, with the speed of an arrow, it was launched at his head. Luckily for my friend, he chanced to raise his eyes in season to dodge the formidable missile, which went directly through a pane of glass in the window in his rear.</p> 
               <p>A suppressed titter glided over the seats, while the little urchins on the low form in front snickered audibly, The master never relaxed a muscle. Dwight sprang to his feet, glanced out of the window, and without the ceremony of permission, walked down the aisle, passed the door, and, after a moment's absence, returned with the ruler, which, with a low bow, was laid on the master's desk.</p> 
               <p>As the wind came in at the broken pane, I handed him my scarf as he returned to his seat; it was stuffed in the sash, and the exercises proceeded as if nothing had occurred.</p> 
               <p>The next morning we found the glass reset. How or when no one ever knew. Dwight declared it must be through Goody Sloper, for the grim old fellow had never stirred from home till the usual school hour. Witchery or otherwise, the window was whole, and not the slightest allusion was ever made to the affair.</p> 
               <p>Recess being over, and the spelling lessons recited, the master put on his hat and overcoat, tied a red bandanna handkerchief about his neck, and drew on a pair of thick blue and white striped mittens. My curiosity was greatly excited. What was he about to do? Having become equipped, he stepped from his desk, and with folded arms, commenced a promenade to and fro in the space between the front desks and the now smouldering fire.</p> 
               <p>Greatly diverted by his eccentricity, I found it impossible to concentrate my attention upon my lesson. After a long silence, during which I imagined the master had become wholly absorbed in his own meditations, in a gruff tone he unexpectedly called out: "Jessie Bradshaw, your sum is on your slate, not over it."</p> 
               <p>I was terribly startled and abashed, and thenceforward shared in the belief of the other pupils, that the master was always cognizant of our doings. Whether he chose to notice or punish any delinquency, depended much upon his humor. He always had his favorites, but those could never count upon immunity. You could never feel safe in ill-doing.</p> 
               <p>The first class having again read, the ruler knocked the welcome hour of dismissal.</p> 
               <p>Though I had enjoyed the day, home was very welcome, and my aunt and Peggy rejoiced my heart with a recital of the lonesome time they had had; even the parson said he had missed his little pupil.</p> 
               <p>This first day was the prototype of many others. The master wielded his despotic sway, with equal eccentricity. One day winking at faults, that at the next would send the Bible, or any other ready article at the offender's devoted head. Little Job Turner, and a whole row of similar dunces, got such a daily thumping and shaking that they scarcely knew A from B,-could do nothing but quake with terror.</p> 
               <p>Notwithstanding this queer, irregular regime, few teachers, in later years, could count more distinguished men and women amongst their pupils, than Master Neal. What was studied, was learned thoroughly, and sometimes the well-read scholar, and acute, far-sighted man, would forget his position and mingle freely with his charge, giving them much information in a pleasant, friendly manner, that was duly appreciated. I am certain these oral instructions were never forgotten, besides binding our hearts to the odd, original instructor, whom we loved as well as feared.</p> 
               <p>In another respect, I think Master Neal's school excelled even our most noted modern seminaries,-its penmanship could not be excelled; a poor writer never left his supervision; our copy-books and arithmetical manuscripts were models of neatness and elegance.</p> 
               <p>Ann Norton glided to and fro in her noiseless way, gracefully receiving the homage of Dwight and most of the other older boys,-looked beautiful, always, and did little else, I soon detected her in copying the worked-out problems of the sums on my slate; this, with like deceptions, roused my scorn and ire. Dwight laughed at my complaint. "Everything could be forgiven such a beauty. Her whole business in life was to be pleasing." That means flirting with the beaux, in that sly, make-believe modest way. "She's a good-for-nothing artful minx, as her husband will find, to his sorrow!" Dwight laughed more immoderately than before. "He did not intend to become her husband,-he much preferred Polly Brown." She and Dwight had become bosom friends. They studied, told stories, sang, and slid down hill together. Both were good scholars, apt and retentive; but equally unmethodical and heedless. Dwight was pursuing a higher course of study than that of the district school; thus a smattering of history and Latin crept into the institution. Polly borrowed Dwight's books, and in an incredibly short time mastered their contents. Her proficiency in the Latin grammar so astonished and delighted the master, that he invited her to recite with Dwight, and for the remainder of the term she was left pretty much to her own devices. Her time was far from misspent, however. She was a great reader, and at my request and the master's recommendation, the parson supplied her books. Besides Josephus and other histories, which were read in school hours, we hung with entrancement, during the noon intermission, over the pages of the "Arabian Nights," which I discovered on a high shelf in the library.</p> 
               <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6399-00000026"/> 
               <p>Dwight drew some admirable caricatures. The master having confiscated one that betrayed the school-house and its inmates, was so much pleased with the performance, that he caused it to be framed, and hung it in his own room.</p> 
               <p>He also painted a water-color portrait of Ann Norton. This more ambitious attempt was entirely successful. The picture and its artist immediately became the two chief wonders of the neighborhood.</p>

               <p>As Ann Norton and Polly Brown had paid me visits, they were anxious for me to return the hospitality.</p> 
               <p>I passed an afternoon at Squire Norton's, but Aunt Compton thought I had better spend only an evening at Mrs. Brown's, they were so straitened in circumstances, and had such a family.</p> 
               <p>Accordingly, one moonlight night, Dwight proposed the visit. Peggy said she would join us. "'T was a long time since she'd seen Miss Brown, and she'd jest fill her pocket with cake and doughnuts for the children." A quarter of an hour's walk brought us to an unpainted, two-story house, which with its surrounding buildings, presented a somewhat dilapidated appearance.</p> 
               <p>Lieutenant Brown had inherited this place from his father, who had been one of the leading men of his day; but having been obliged to sell part, to pay legacies to his sisters, it was diminished in importance. Enough remained to give its owner a livelihood; a prudent, industrious man could not have failed to obtain one; but unfortunately the Lieutenant was neither.</p> 
               <p>A member of the army from the battle of Lexington till the close of the war, much of his early training had seen lost. The rustic boy, a novice to the world and its wiles, had returned the elegant officer, with polished manners and refined tastes. The camp had been an indifferent school for close application and business-habits, and the superior officer made but a poor farmer, while he was a most agreeable visitor, and the jolliest of boon companions.</p> 
               <p>If Mrs. Brown had been an energetic, calculating body; had even made her home as pleasant as some wives, her husband's course might have been quite different; but she had been a beauty, the pet of her family; till her marriage, had never known a care, or had a wish crossed. If good fortune had borne her forward, she would have floated noiselessly down the unruffled tide, with the reputation of a good wife, and sweet, gentle woman; as it was, she succumbed to the first wave of adversity, became discouraged and fretful, and before long was recorded as the most unthrifty and slatternly housekeeper in the parish. Everything was quickly at sixes and sevens, both within and without. No wonder that the neat, fastidious officer was glad to leave his cheerless home, fault-finding spouse, and dirty children, for congenial society, at the warm, bright barroom of the Main road tavern; less wonder that complaints and reproaches awaited his return. Ere many years, absolute want came to the household. Children alone were plenty, and bright, pretty children they were, if washed and neatly dressed; but, fill Polly was fourteen years old, the whole troop ran about, a perfectly unkempt horde of little savages. At that age, Miss Polly suddenly awakened to a sense of responsibility, and set herself energetically to work a reform. Encouraging her oldest brother, a lad some fourteen months younger than herself, to remodel without, she began to sweep and scour within; and with what help the next sister could render, the house was soon put in as good order as her neighbor's.</p> 
               <p>The next step was to clothe the children. Relatives and Mends came to the young girl's assistance, and the whole band were made presentable.</p> 
               <p>This new era brought fresh life to Lieut. Brown; and though he still loved the tavern and a social glass rather too well, his affairs had for the past two years been rapidly improving; several old debts had been cancelled, and his farm had been managed with much more skill and care. Polly had been apprised of our intended visit, and the family-room was as neat as a pin; a bright fire burned on a clean hearth; fresh sand had been strewn over the floor, and a pair of mould candles burned in well-polished brass candlesticks on the round stand before the fire.</p> 
               <p>The Lieutenant, who, in the worst of times, had always kept himself clean and respectable, received us in his Sun-day coat, with nicely powdered hair. Mrs. Brown looked rejuvenated in her new cap and clean apron; and, as she serenely jogged her infant in the cradle, presented much of the beauty for which she formerly had been celebrated.</p> 
               <p>The younger children were in bed, but Joseph and Bethia were busily at work on the form in the chimney corner.</p> 
               <p>"How fast you knit, Bethy," said Peggy, as she seated herself in the chair which her host, with all the grace that characterized the gentleman of that day, presented.</p> 
               <p>"What are you doing, Josy?"</p> 
               <p>"Why, I declare, the boy is pegging a mitten. Well, we've come to a real live," she added, as Polly seated herself at the stand, with her work-basket and a set of shoes. "How long is it since you took to binding shoes, Polly?"</p> 
               <p>"This is my second set."</p> 
               <p>"She says she is going to earn some new finery," explained her father.</p> 
               <p>"Well, that's clever; I like to see gals have force; I 'd rather they would dress a leetle too much rather than too leetle."</p> 
               <p>"I believe you are right, Miss Peggy. Polly reminds me of my mother. She was just such an energetic body. Always set everybody to work."</p> 
               <p>"No grass ever grew under her feet. She was a blessed woman. Let's see, she died while you was in the war."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, just before the surrender of Cornwallis."</p> 
               <p>"Were you at the battle of Bunker Hill, Lieutenant?" inquired Dwight.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, my boy, I marched with the minute-men the day after the battle of Lexington, and only came home for short visits, at long intervals, during the remainder of the war."</p> 
               <p>"Do tell me about the battle of Bunker Hill: I have always longed to hear the story from one of the actors on that field."</p> 
               <p>"I will do my best to gratify you. It is a pleasure to an old soldier to fight his battles o'er again."</p> 
               <p>"The troubles between the mother country and her colonies had, as you know, been long brewing, and the presence of the British troops in Boston had increased the indignation to a pitch bordering on frenzy, and events were awaited in impatient anxiety. Committees of safety were on the alert, and minute-men held themselves in constant readiness. All over the land was the expectant hush preceding the deafening thunder peal. The battle of Lexington was fought April nineteenth. About midnight, a messenger arrived with the intelligence. I was awakened by my next neighbor, who also was a minute-man, and after short preparations<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6399-00000027"/> tions, and hasty adieus, we started for the place of rendezvous. It was near daybreak when we reached the training field, most of the soldiers were assembled, the rest soon appeared. After Parson Compton had implored the divine blessing, we set forth.</p> 
               <p>"The sun was just rising, when with three hearty cheers from the assembled crowd, which was as lustily returned, we commenced our march, and about eleven o'clock on the second night after our departure, we arrived in Cambridge.</p> 
               <p>"We found about twenty thousand men assembled there, but they were wholly undisciplined, and, in their homespun clothes, presented a most motley appearance. Little wonder that the well-equipped regulars made a jest of us.</p> 
               <p>"Officers had not been appointed, and as no regular enlistment had been made, there was great confusion. It was a difficult matter for the general officers, and the committee of safety, to keep together and provide for such a body of men. Our provisions had immediately followed us, we had plenty to eat, but not being provided with camp kettles, it was difficult to get our food cooked.</p> 
               <p>"Gen. Ward was in command; under him were Generals Heath and Whitcomb. Gen. Putnam and Col. Stark came in a few days, but there was not much order. The people were in a state of alarm. Many of the inhabitants of Cambridge had fled from their homes, but the men were threatened with punishment if they injured property. Soon the minute-men returned home, some to resume their former occupations, others to make preparations to again join the army. I came home for a few days, then in Gerrish's regiment marched to the seat of war.</p> 
               <p>"We began to throw up fortifications. Putnam urged the importance of these works; but the army was still in an unorganized state. Officers had not received their commissions, there was want of ordnance, and much confusion everywhere. The army had not become fully organized, when the battle took place. There were frequent skirmishes between us and the red-coats, in which we were generally victors; this kept us lively and in good spirits. We had many good officers and privates, old soldiers that had served in the French war; besides all our men were sharp shooters, with plenty of spunk well roused up. Three companies of our regiment formed the left wing of the army at Chelsea; my company was still at Cambridge, when it was decided to fortify Bunker Hill.</p> 
               <p>"Orders were issued on the sixteenth of June for Prescott's, Fry's and Bridge's regiments, with a fatigue party of Connecticut troops, to parade with intrenching tools on Cambridge common, at six in the evening. The men were ordered to furnish themselves with blankets, and food for twenty-four hours. Col. Gridley's artillery company, with two field pieces, were also ordered to parade. They assembled and were placed under the command of Col. William Prescott. President Langdon, of Harvard College, made a fervent prayer, and about nine o'clock they marched away.</p> 
               <p>"That was an anxious night to those in the camp, as well as to the workers on the hill. At dawn, the boom of cannon from the men-of-war in the harbor announced that the day's work had commenced. Everybody was instantly astir. The sun rose red and fiery, as though he too had become belligerent, and the day soon became excessively warm.</p> 
               <p>"At the first report of the cannon, Gen. Putnam urged the necessity of re-enforcing Prescott; but Gen. Ward was cautious till he should find where Gage would make his chief attack. He feared he would come to Cambridge to destroy the stores there, and only a part of Stark's regiment were then sent to the hill; but, about eleven, other re-enforcements were dispatched, and three companies were recalled from Chelsea.</p> 
               <p>"When the news came that the regulars had landed in Charlestown, there was great clamor and confusion, the bells rang, the drums beat, and adjutants rode from point to point. I ran for my arms and ammunition, and hastened to my company, which was now ordered to the scene of action. About three o'clock we arrived within its precincts.</p> 
               <p>"What a sight it was before us! The British were retiring from their first repulse; Our men, much elated, stood firm to their post; beyond, the ships and batteries belched forth their destructive missiles. The smoke and flame of burning Charlestown rose toward heaven like an incense fire on the altar of liberty. The surrounding hills, fields, roofs, and steeples were crowded with spectators, while the air was filled with the roar of artillery, the rattle of musketry, the crash of falling timbers, and the cries and shouts of the combatants.</p> 
               <p>"Our colonel, a jolly, portly man, a good officer, but not much used to exertion, at this point expressed himself completely used up, and unable to proceed farther, and with a most unwarrior-like air, threw himself beside a haycock. This was not the best example for raw recruits, that had never before smelt gunpowder; but most of the men were rallied, and under the command of our adjutant, a gallant Danish officer, who had seen service, rushed to the mele.</p> 
               <p>"By this time, the British were preparing for their last attack. Prescott kept good order at the redoubt, and if he had been provided with sufficient ammunition, it never could have been carried; but on Bunker Hill there was great confusion. Some were hurrying from the scene of conflict, alleging that having worked twenty-four hours without refreshment (for many had neglected to provide themselves with food), they could do no more; men were scattered behind rocks, haycocks and trees.</p> 
               <p>"After the redoubt was scaled, everybody fought pretty much on his own hook, with whatever weapon he could command. Oh, that we had possessed a sufficiency of ammunition!</p> 
               <p>"When I first approached the field, a cold shudder ran over me; but this soon vanished, and without a thought of self or danger, I fought like a tiger.</p> 
               <p>"Somehow, I never could tell exactly how, I found myself at a rail-fence, where a breast-work had been formed from the new-mown hay. Here a considerable force maintained their ground with great firmness. They resisted every effort to turn their flank, and prevented the main body, who were retreating in disorder, from being cut off. When we saw that Prescott had left the hill, we commenced a retreat in remarkably good order, considering the circumstances. There was great slaughter on the top of Bunker Hill. Edmund fell there, Peggy. It was a glorious death! Much better was it to die there, with a memory honored and revered, than to have skulked with some of his comrades behind hay-stacks."</p> 
               <p>"That it was, Lieutenant," replied Peggy, with flashing eyes, but her mouth twitched nervously. After an instant's pause, she added more steadily, but still in a rather unnatural tone: It was well. I never murmured, though he was as good a lad as ever shouldered a musket, and I was left alone. Alone till the judgment, but that can be borne,-eternity is our portion."</p> 
               <p>Dear Peggy, what a chapter in her life this evening had disclosed! Who would have dreamed that this prim,<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6399-00000028"/> angular maiden, thus faithfully cherished the memory of a youthful love, thus communed in spirit with the early lost! How little do we really know of the interior, spiritual life, the actual life of those around us! My heart clave strongly to Peggy from that hour.</p> 
               <p>What a day that seventeenth of June was to us at home," said Mrs. Brown. "We had but just got over the fright of that scare about the 'regulars coming.'"</p> 
               <p>"Do tell us about that, Mrs. Brown," I implored; "I have heard grandma'am say everybody was scared nearly out of their wits."</p> 
               <p>"They were; I 'm sure I was. I can scarcely remember anything about it, I was in such a fright. We took our best things and went into the pasture, where we staid all night."</p> 
               <p>"How soon after the battle of Lexington was the great 'fright?'" asked Dwight.</p> 
               <p>"Two days, Peggy. It is as fresh in my mind as if it were but yesterday, It had been a stirring, busy day; for as soon as the minute-men had started, the committee of safety sent round carts to collect provisions from every house. We sent everything we had baked, besides beef, pork, and bacon.</p> 
               <p>"I had jest got an oven-ful of victuals on the table to cool, and gone into the yard to milk, when I heard somebody galloping furiously along the road, was going to watch with old Miss Prime (this Mr. Prime's mother). Thinking she was wuss or dead, I ran into the lane. At that moment a man flew past, screaming, 'The Regerlars are coming; they have landed on Plum Island, and have got as far as Artichoke bridge, burning and killing all on the way.'</p> 
               <p>"For a minute my strength seemed to all go from me; I couldn't seem to see nor hear; all in a maze, I crawled into the house. I met my brother Sam with his gun; he told me to bring him the big powder horn. By the time I had brought the powder, Deacon Foot's hired man had come with his gun, and in a few minutes, more than a dozen had gone down the road shouting,' Vengeance to the red-coated rascals!'</p> 
               <p>"Deacon Foot now come in, all out of breath, to get me to go to his wife, who he said was in a dead faint; marm asked him what it was best to do, but he didn't seem to have his wits sufficiently to understand anything; so she telled me to see to Miss Foot, and she would run over to the parsonage. Arter sir died, marm allers went to Parson Compton when in a strait.</p> 
               <p>"I run into the deacon's. If I hadn't been so scared, I should sartingly have laughed. Ye never see folks in sich a pickle. Miss Foot lay clean gone, on the kitchen floor, jest as she had fallen. The hired gal was setting stock still, raly scared out of all sense. The baby was screaming at the top of its lungs, in the cradle where it had been tossed by some of'em; leetle Molly was rocking it furiously, crying herself as though her heart would break, while Aunt Nabby, the deacon's phthisicky, old maid aunt, swayed back and forth in her arm-chair, moaning and wheezing.</p> 
               <p>"I caught up the baby, bade Molly hush, spoke a comforting word to Aunt Nabby, and shook up Judy, the hired gal. By this time Miss Foot had begun to come round, I got her into a chair and gave her some rum and water.</p> 
               <p>"The deacon now come in, all of a quiver. Miss Foot inquired for Israel.</p> 
               <p>"He was up in the Higgins lot, but must be back soon.</p> 
               <p>"Next she asked what it was best to do. The deacon thought we had best wait for marm, and see what the parson advised; meantime he would take care of his papers and money, and she had better hide her spoons and best things.</p> 
                
               <p>"Squire Norton came in directly. He was going to yoke his oxen to the cart and take his family to an old house he owned, away off from any road, and well hidden by hills and woods, and he advised the deacon to line them. Miss Foot instantly fell in with the plan. The deacon hid his papers in a hollow tree; Miss Foot tied up her silver spoons and lowered 'em down the well. (I couldn't see why 'twant jest as well them with her. But she persisted in her own consait.) Judy was so beside herself, that she pulled the knobs and drops out of her ears, and threw them arter the spoons. I tried to stop her, but she was too spry for me. Miss Foot got her spoons the next day, but poor Judy could never fish up her earrings though she tried every day that summer.</p> 
               <p>"Marm now jined us; the parson thought the whole matter would turn out as it did,-a big scare. He said it didn't look probable. So marm concluded not to jine the party, but to go home; as Israel had not yet got back, I was commissioned to tell him where they had gone. The squire now drove up, and Aunt Nabby was hoisted into the cart; Miss Foot followed, but with a scream, she was as quickly out. What do you spose in her fright she had done? Why caught up the cat instead of her baby! If the regerlars had been in sight, I should have laughed! Well, arter a while, they got started, and marm and I went home and finished milking.</p> 
               <p>"I telled our leetle Paul to keep a look out for Israel Foot. He came about dusk. He said he guessed as the boys had all gone, that he would stay to defend marm and me, and their premises. I thought him wonderful brave all of a sudden, but jest concluded it was a show off, as 1 had twitted him well, for lacking courage to go with the minutemen. Jacob Prime came for me with the horse and pillion in half an hour; the poor boy was e'en-jest scared out of his wits, and I found the whole family in the awfullest flurry. They had got old Marm Prime wrapped in blankets, and the horse waiting in the old-fashioned 'chair,' ready to take her down into South-end paster. How they expected to get her down that rocky hill, steep as the ruff of a house, is more than I can tell; it was well for the old lady they didn't try. It was a long night, and notwithstanding what the parson had said, I could not get rightly settled. The moaning of the wind, and the singing of the fire more than once, set my heart to beating as I fancied them to be the far-off sounds of the drums and fifes of the regerlars. But no regerlars appeared, and at sunrise I went home.</p> 
               <p>"The boys had marched to Port; but not hearing anything of regerlars, had come back by midnight. The squire's and deacon's folks got back by the time the sun was half an hour high. They had had a terrible time. Aunt Nabby breathed so hard, they were afeared the regerlars would hear her; so they wrapped her in a coverlit, and buried her in the leaves away off in the middle of the woods, as much as a mile from any living creeter. The poor old soul nearly perished. Miss Foot's baby squalled so, that the squire wanted to kill it, he was so afraid it would diskiver their hiding-place. There was now a great hullabaloo for Israel. Marm had not seen him since nine o'clock the night afore. As he did not appear, the men folks went in search of him. They found him perched in a tree, at the farther eend of the long paster. Afraid to stay at home, he had taken a loaf of bread and a junk of salt pork, and hidden himself in the tree. Not knowing what might be going on at home, he hadn't dare to come down."</p> 
               <p>After the general laugh had subsided,<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6399-00000029"/> Dwight said, "He supposed the poltroon never heard the last of that brave exploit."</p> 
               <p>"No, that he didn't," replied Peggy. "He was fairly goaded into jining Gerrish's regiment, but it didn't mend the matter; if his colonel hid behind a haycock you couldn't expect Israel to fight."</p> 
               <p>"How soon did you know of the battle of Bunker Hill?" asked Polly.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, that day" said Peggy. "I was up to South-end, helping Jessie's grand-marm. Tim Talmer, the tailor, was to work there. Some time in the forenoon somebody said it thundered; but as the sky was as clear as a bell we thought it couldn't be. As the strange sounds kep' on we went to the door to listen: 'I'll tell ye what't is,' says old Tim, 'them's big guns.' Jest then, Sam Stuart ran up from the field, crying out there is a fight; there is a battle. Old Nat Silsbee, who has been in the French war, says it is an engagement, and by the sound, he should say it was at or near Boston.' The boom of the cannon grew louder and louder, and was heard in many places, Half the town came up to South-end; that is such a sightly place. About noon we began to discern smoke jest on the edge of the southern sky; it grew heavier and heavier; we thought Boston must be burning. Dear sake, what an awful afternoon that was! A'most everybody had some of their family in the army, so you may judge what an anxious time it must have been."</p> 
               <p>"How soon did you learn the particulars?" I asked.</p> 
               <p>"We learnt that the battle was at Bunker Hill, and that it was Charles-town that had been burnt, the next day; but the particulars did not come till nearly a week arter,-but they came quick enough," the good woman added, in a husky voice. Polly, wishing to turn the conversation and enliven Peggy, requested her father to sing us some of the patriotic songs, popular during the war.</p> 
               <p>"I will sing the 'Vision' a song composed during the siege of Boston." Clearing his throat, the Lieutenant commenced: <q>

               <p>This specimen of the rustic songs of the Revolution was received with applause. The Lieut. was a good singer, and as the tunes were lively, they were much better sung than repeated.</p> 
               <p>Dwight drew his chair beside his host, to enter still further upon the scenes of the war, while we women-kind regaled ourselves with a little harmless neighborhood gossip.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">FAST.</head> 
               <p>APRIL brought the annual fast. Breakfast over, the beans and Indian pudding in the oven, a sabbatical silence settled upon the household. At eleven o'clock, we repaired to meeting, where a long sermon upon the delinquencies of the time, was preached to a crowded audience.</p> 
               <p>As there was but an hour's intermission, I concluded to remain at the church, Ann Norton invited me to partake of some viands that she had surreptitiously concealed in her capacious pocket,-a kindness I scornfully declined.</p> 
               <p>Dwight praised my honorable contempt for Annie's irreligious deceit, but hoped I did not consider myself more heavenly for an empty stomach.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Norton and Mrs. Brown joined grandma'am in her pew, and solaced themselves for the lack of their dinner, in a general dissection of the whole parish, much to the discomfort of my scandal-hating relative.</p> 
               <p>Afternoon meeting over, everybody hurried home to the smoking viands awaiting them. How good the beans and pudding did taste! Job, poor fellow, ate so much that he was ill several days. After supper, a party of young men and boys were espied playing football in the master's pasture.</p> 
               <p>We were appropriately shocked. Playing ball Fast-day I Dwight must be the instigator of such wickedness!</p> 
               <p>The evening was spent at the master's. Aunt Suzy Neal being an invalid, was debarred from attending divine service; this deprivation was often supplied by the master with a sermon of his own writing. As I was sure these must be unique productions, I had begged permission to be present at the next reading.</p> 
               <p>Accordingly, Fast morning, an invitation<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6399-00000030"/> tation to that effect had been forwarded by Aunt Judy.</p> 
               <p>Peggy accompanied me with the assurance, "that though the master was a real old sinner, he could preach the most argumentative sarmons. Even the divil ought to have his due; and she must own, nothing could beat 'em for cuteness."</p> 
               <p>A chorus of hospitable greetings met us at the door, and we were escorted to Aunt Susy's room by the quartette of maidens. Dwight soon came in, with a quite perceptible limp.</p> 
               <p>"What was the matter? Was he hurt?" was the instantaneous inquiry.</p> 
               <p>"It was a mere nothing; only a slight sprain from tossing a foot-ball."</p> 
               <p>"And served him right! A just retribution for playing ball Fast" pronounced the unanimous verdict.</p> 
               <p>"No sin had been committed. Fast was not an ordinance from God, only from the governor. It was well to thus set apart a day at this season for religious observance, but sheer nonsense to refrain from food and innocent recreation."</p> 
               <p>"Take care, youngster; you are invading my province," grimly interrupted the master, as, with twinkling eyes, he entered and seated himself by the oval stand next Aunt Susy. I knew by the expression of his face, that he was highly delighted with Dwight's homily, and shrewdly suspected that the manuscript he drew from his pocket did not lessen his self-appreciation.</p> 
               <p>A pause,-a silence only broken by the sputtering of the green logs on the fire,-then with a loud hem the reader doubled back his page, and, in a distinct, emphatic tone, named his text.</p> 
               <p>"There appeared a great wonder in heaven-a <emph>woman</emph>." A slight murmur, and an amazed look which subsided into a smile, passed round the circle; then the master commenced his sermon, which I am sure critics must have pronounced both meritorious and remarkable. Few divines could match it. The dark side of a true picture was graphically portrayed. Every evil under the sun, from the fall of Eve down, was directly and forcibly traced to the malign influence of woman upon man. Severe and one-sided as was this essay, I was not then disposed to question its truth, and I am sorry to add, that time and knowledge of the world has but heightened my admiration of the master's penetration.</p> 
               <p>The old maids declared that brother was "too bad"; and Dwight intimated that our host should delineate the genial power of the softer sex in his next effort.</p> 
               <p>"No," Peggy hurriedly interposed. "But master, do jest show up how the masculine ninnies are nosed round by the good-for-nothing, artful hussies, while they jest turn their backs on the good, sensible women."</p> 
               <p>Dwight declared, "That was just it, and if the master needed help, Jessie would be on hand, for he had a personal knowledge of her eloquence on that subject."</p> 
               <p>The master shrugged his shoulders, and muttered something about jealousy of the pretty Ann; a sentence he was not destined to finish. Gallantly kissing the hand I clapped over his lips, he laughingly declared present company was always excepted, or he would show how this was a living example of his theory, with a low bow (not of the malign), but of the influence of what are termed the gentler sex. Why, who else could thus stop his mouth save the divine Jessie?</p> 
               <p>Half frightened, yet greatly diverted, I continued the banter till Aunt Judy and Peggy asserted, amid peals, of laughter, that the preacher had got the worst of it. "I telled Parson Noles last week 't was a pity Jessie hadn't been born a boy, she would have been sich an orator," proudly out-spoke Peggy.</p> 
               <p>"She is just right," returned the master, wiping his eyes; "Heavens! I never expected to laugh so again, in this world."-"Did you expect to in another?" I saucily inquired. A pinch on the cheek was my reply; then Dwight was directed to take me home. "Children ought to be in bed, and he was scandalized at such behavior, Fast. Dwight must read me another homily."</p> 
               <p>Our shawls were brought, and a merry good-night exchanged.</p> 
               <p>Peggy affirmed, "That she believed the witches was in Dwight and me! Who would ever have believed that Master Neal could be so sociable? She hated him like pison, but must own he had been real agreeable that night,"</p> 
               <p>Toward the end of the month, I heard Peggy muttering and snuffing in the dairy. I demanded the trouble, for since our visit to Lieutenant Brown's we had been great cronies.</p> 
               <p>The following evening I had ventured to inquire for the hero of Bunker Hill. It was long ere the poor body had had an opportunity to unburthen her heart, and it was with unspeakable delight that the tale was poured into my sympathising ear. Vividly she painted the handsome, brave young man; graphically depicted the morning of his departure, when with a foreboding heart, but dry eyes and steady voice, she bade him do his duty, in life and in death; she was his, wholly and entirely his, in death as in life, she would remain true to him. Deep and heroic as, had been the girl's love of that solemn hour, it was faint in comparison to that now welling in the breast of the ancient maiden, who through all these long solitary years had thus silently cherished the memory of the departed. Steadily refusing every offer of marriage (though several that might have been considered tempting had been offered), this glorified love, this spiritual union had been the one softening influence in her lonely, desolated heart, and whimsical, fretful, yet kindly nature,-the one gleam that had kept her interior affections a shrine for love and faith.</p> 
               <p>Not receiving an answer, I stepped to the dairy. From the compressed lips and turned-up nose, I inferred something important had occurred; at any rate here was a terrible to-do. "Would she please tell me what was amiss?"</p> 
               <p>"Pooty days"-a loud huff, while the upper lip curled still more scornfully,-"Pooty days we're fell on for sartin. Pooty times-'twant so when I was a gal. When I was a gal, ministers was ministers; in them days, they was shepherds to the sheep, pastors breaking the bread of life to their congregations. Catch yer blessed Uncle Compton doing sich a thing! He'd a scorned it! Well, times has altered! new days, new laws; I guess we sha'nt see the millennium in a hurry."</p> 
               <p>"What has the parson done, Peggy?" I inquired, in amazement.</p> 
               <p>"He hain't done nothing, as I knows on."</p> 
               <p>"What is he going to do, then?"</p> 
               <p>"Throw up his office and go to laming boys?"</p> 
               <p>"Teaching boys! why, is he going to keep school?"</p> 
               <p>"Keep school! (a great huff); being a perfesser in Cambridge college, ain't being a school-master, I take it." I began to gather in the matter. "The parson going to leave his charge for a professorship at Harvard? that could not be permitted; he must not think of such an idea. A clergyman ought to spend his life amongst the people over whom he has been ordained."</p> 
               <p>"Much as ye know about the matter," was returned in a tone of condescending derision. "Anybody that is ministerial larnt can preach; but<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6399-00000031"/> tain't everybody that has the gumption to larn the ministers. That's what our parson is called to do, Jessie." Straightening herself, with great pride, she added:-</p> 
               <p>"That's it, to larn the ministers and set the college straight. Keep it good, old, sound Arminian, and not let any of these new-fangled Hopkinsian doctrines take root in it. 'Tain't everybody that has the gift to do that, but our parson has it, he'll put it all through like a book."</p> 
               <p>"But, Peggy, I thought you were averse to his going!"</p> 
               <p>"I didn't meant to have him fling his light under a bushel measure," was the reply, as with pursed-up lips she resumed breaking up her cheese curd.</p> 
               <p>As I well knew, words were useless when the good woman was in one of these fractious, contradictory moods, I sought my aunt for an explanation of the matter.</p> 
               <p>I found that a professorship had been urged upon the parson, and after much prayerful deliberation he had concluded to accept it.</p> 
               <p>At the next Thursday lecture, the congregation were informed of their pastor's projected departure.</p> 
               <p>A murmur of grief and disapprobation swept through the house, but as the clergyman proceeded to state his reasons, silence was obtained.</p> 
               <p>"He had concluded that he could do more good at Harvard than in his parish; he felt that it was his duty to go, heresy was creeping into the institution. Honor or emolument could have been no inducement."</p> 
               <p>"You lie, you know you lie!" shouted the stalwart butcher from the Main road, as he sprang from his seat, and shook his clenched fist at the speaker's face.</p> 
               <p>Immense sensation ensued. People were greatly shocked and incensed with Mr. Hardy, but Parson Noles' calm tones soon quelled the tumult. He reiterated his previous statement, and proceeded in such a logical and friendly strain, that soon there was not a dissenting mind or dry eye in the assembly.</p> 
               <p>It was hard to part, but duty must be before inclination,-their minister must go. Butcher Hardy alone held aloof, his wife and son exerted themselves to compromise matters. The parson was invited to dine, the old gentleman coaxed into an apology, and the affair was thus settled in amity.</p> 
               <p>As the parson did not intend to commence his new labors until after the summer vacation, he continued his pastoral relation up to that period.</p> 
               <p>The first of May, Mrs. Norton called to obtain my name on a list of pupils she was obtaining to form a select school. A niece of hers wished to form one, and considered our parish a suitable spot to commence the task.</p> 
               <p>The squire's lady was greatly rejoiced to secure such an advantage for her daughter Ann. Her niece had attended Atkinson Academy two terms, besides taking lessons all the previous winter in drawing and needle-work, from a most accomplished Boston lady. Of course she must be highly qualified for a teacher."</p> 
               <p>After consultation with James, it was decided that I should join the genteel seminary.</p> 
               <p>Dropping into Polly Brown's soon after, I found her busy making candles. The moulds for the best candles were full of tallow, and the rods on the candle-frame were crowded with dipped.</p> 
               <p>"Here I am, up to my elbows in grease, Jessie, but I am right glad to see you. Sit down and take off your things, I shall be done soon," said the lively girl, as she lifted her hot face as I entered.</p> 
               <p>"This candle-making is a good job well over, isn't it, Polly?" I exclaimed, as I seated myself.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, indeed; next week I must make soap, then comes house-cleaning with the lye. I am in a hurry to get everything extra done up before Bethy goes to school."</p> 
               <p>"Who is to keep the summer school?"</p> 
               <p>"A Miss Duncan; our little tribe will go there, but Betty is going to Miss Norton's famous school."</p> 
               <p>"Is she?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I wish I could go, but if wishes were horses, beggars might ride."</p> 
               <p>"Why can't you go, Polly?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, we can't afford it, I am going without a new gown to send Bethia. Mother thought I must have one for I have outgrown all my last summer dresses, but I can pattern the white, and my dark calico will do. It is a good thing not to be a beauty; it don't signify what I wear, and it is convenient always to know what to put on."</p> 
               <p>"Should you have time to attend school, if it was easy to pay the tuition," I somewhat hesitatingly queried"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I guess so you needn't be afraid to ask questions, Jessie, it does me good to plan with you, I have to do so much thinking alone; Bethy is a good girl, but hasn't got your long head, Miss Wisdom. I shall have more dairy work this summer, for we have another cow. We had pasture enough, but father couldn't muster the money for one, hard as he tried last year, so I bound shoes to help out last winter."</p> 
               <p>"Why, I thought you were going to buy a silk dress."</p> 
               <p>"That is what I pretended, and perhaps it will get it after a while. My cow will earn us fifty dollars a year, but, dear heart, there are so many mouths to feed! and I could not earn quite enough to pay for the heifer, though I bound early and late, but I guess that the spring butter will more than do it and I mean to make splendid cheeses; they won't be very large, but Josy is raising somes calves,-I expect to have a wonderful dairy in a few years."</p> 
               <p>"But you could not do all that work, and go to school."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I think I could manage. Bethy is smart and Molly begins to help. The mornings are long, and school is out so early there is quite an afternoon often. I think I could do it, though I should have to work; but that is good for me. See how I grow, and how strong I am. At any rate I am determined to send Bethy, we will have one lady in the family."</p> 
               <p>I inquired for Mrs. Brown and the children.</p> 
               <p>"Mother has gone into the squire's to tea. I like to have her and baby out of the way, when I have great works going on. The children are dropping corn for father, and as I am in a hurry to fit them for the summer, I told Bethy she might take her sewing up stairs, and I would finish my candles."</p> 
               <p>With admiration, I gazed at this young girl, thus voluntarily assuming the burthen of her family, and for the first time rejoiced in the possession of wealth. Dear Polly, she should go to school, she should have a new dress, all the sisters should have new gowns.</p> 
               <p>Full of these schemes, I impatiently awaied James' appearance; on his arrival, rushed into a statement of plans.</p> 
               <p>"Stop, stop, pet! how fast you talk! Lieutenant Brown is a mere sot I un-stand."</p> 
               <p>"He has reformed, and it is entirely owing to Polly's exertion and influence,"</p> 
               <p>"She is that great, raw-boned girl with a red face, that sits in the gallery at meeting?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes."</p> 
               <p>"That girl is just fitted for a smart<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6399-00000032"/> country woman; do not strive to raise her above her place, Jessie."</p> 
               <p>I tried to explain: "Polly was a remarkable scholar."</p> 
               <p>"That is not desirable for one in her sphere," interrupted my provoking guardian. "She is a coarse, strong girl, made for hard work, with a fund of animal spirits and wit to carry her through it. She is a blessing to her family, but not just the companion for you. Ann Norton is a much more fitting associate. She is a sweet, gentle girl, with an angelic face, and perfect manners. I hope you will make her your intimate friend."</p> 
               <p>I opened my eyes, and thought of the master's sermon. What a lack of discernment my wise cousin displayed! From that hour, I doubted his infallibility; gave up my blind dependence, began to look and judge for myself. It was no use to discuss matters, that I knew full well; so in a meek tone, I inquired about the dresses.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I will bring you some calico; how much do you want?"</p> 
               <p>"A whole piece."</p> 
               <p>"Whew, entering the wholesale business, are you? Why not give your colored gowns, they will be outgrown before you are out of mourning?" I did not see any necessity for all this economy, and knew it would make Polly more work to alter my old dresses than to cut new, but thought it best to acquiesce, with the proviso that Polly should have a nice gown.</p> 
               <p>"I will bring it next week, but it is not best to assist able-bodied people too much, Jessie. Lieutenant Brown ought to be as well off as the rest of the parish."</p> 
               <p>I saw that James, like many another business man, was no great philanthropist; so reserved future plans for Aunt Compton's more sympathizing ear. As in the openness of my heart, I had confided my fine schemes to Polly, James had placed me in rather an awkward position. I could not report what he had said, and I would not invent an untruth. Softening the explanation as much as possible, I related why my guardian had circumscribed my bounty. I bungled the story so much, however, that Polly instantly suspected the truth.</p> 
               <p>"What a pity you couldn't muster some of Ann Norton's deceit at a pinch, my dear, honest Jessie," Polly replied-with a smile (it was bitter though), and with her most queenly air she added, "It is very well. I thank Mr. Lee for his consideration. I doubt not I shall be more usefully employed, more profitably for myself and others."</p> 
               <p>"Don't be angry, with me, Polly," I implored.</p> 
               <p>"Angry with you, my dear darling, I never dreamt of the thing, I shall love you dearly all my life. If I did not love you, Jessie, I would not be thus beholden to you, but you have much, I little; we are both God's children, why should we not share with each other? All I wish is to fit myself for a useful, independent life. If you are willing to help I am willing to be helped. The tables may turn some day. We are dependent creatures, one great family, placed in this world to co-operate together."</p> 
               <p>Dear Polly, I could assist her in remodelling my cast off-garments. Several days were devoted to that purpose.</p> 
               <p>The next Saturday, James brought me a bundle. Opening it, I found a pretty purple cambric calico, and a beautiful blue gauze fan, flowered with Spangles.</p> 
               <p>With astonishment, I asked if that fan was for Polly.</p> 
               <p>"No; I might present it to Miss Ann Norton." Here was a dilemna, but I would be truthful. Handing my guardian the fan, I answered, if you desire Ann to have this, please present it yourself. I dislike her exceedingly, and cannot so hypocritical as to feign regard."</p> 
               <p>James gazed at me incredulously, and sternly replied, "That he hoped I was not growing opinionated."</p> 
               <p>The next day the new teacher appeared in the squire's pew. She was a rather pretty lady, in her cousin's style of beauty, and astonished our country folks with the splendor of a peach-bloom silk, and white hat, with long, drooping plumes. Altogether, she was a very elegant personage; few would have questioned her capacity for a preceptress. As I saw that my guardian's eyes often wandered in her direction, on our way home I rather maliciously inquired, "If he wasn't afraid I should get too polished with such an exquisite instructress?"</p> 
               <p>"I was really growing rude; he did not wish to see me such an artificial Miss as this Miss Norton, but Her cousin Ann was perfectly natural; he was sorry my taste was so low as to prefer that vulgar Polly Brown to the ladylike beauty."</p> 
               <p>Dwight's amused glance attracted James' attention.</p> 
               <p>"Why did I entertain such a dislike to the pretty girl?" he asked.</p> 
               <p>"Did you ever hear of rival beauties agreeing? Besides, Ann has copied Jessie's sums all winter. Angels have nothing to do with facts and figures; you and lean forgive her, but it is not so easy for Jessie."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, ha! I understand! So the pretty Ann does not love arithmetic? Ho wonder; she wasn't made for anything but poetry and sentiment."</p> 
               <p>I suppose my face was eloquent, for Dwight fell into one of his ecstasies, and James gave me a look of condescending sufferance that increased my I impatience.</p> 
               <p>The next Monday the school commenced, in a large chamber at the squire's.</p> 
               <p>The studies were confined to reading and spelling,-the greater part of the time being devoted to needle-work.</p> 
               <p>Miss Norton exhibited specimens of her handiwork that delighted her pupils. These consisted of a mourning-piece, wrought in silks, with a figure dressed in the latest French mode, weeping over a funeral urn in the queerest perspective; and a sampler, upon which was depicted a red house, with a diminutive tree, garnished with stupendous scarlet apples, a mammoth robin perched in the top, and a natural curiosity, designed for a boy, beneath.</p> 
               <p>If it had not been for the ladies capacity to induct me into the mysteries of pocket-book stitch, and embroidery on muslin, my summer would have been entirely wasted.</p> 
               <p>As it was, my eyes became so weakened by the various fine openwork stitches then in vogue, that I did not commence a second term.</p> 
               <p>I had scarcely seen; Polly during the season, and was happy to receive a visit. She looked well in her new dress, and I noted a marked improvement in manner,-the hoyden was fast merging into a well-bred, stately young lady.</p> 
               <p>As she rose to take leave, she produced a small packet. "Some trifles she hoped I would accept." Opening it, I found a prettily wrought muslin tucker, and a spray of wild roses, painted in water colors.</p> 
               <p>"Why, Polly, where did you get these?"</p> 
               <p>"I did them."</p> 
               <p>"You! Did you paint these roses?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes."</p> 
               <p>"How!" I exclaimed in astonishment.</p> 
               <p>"Why, I learned it by watching Dwight. He gave me the paints. The first was a great daub, but Dwight bade me persevere. This is the sixth copy I have made, the fifth was decent.<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6399-00000033"/> I gave it to Dwight, but this is much better."</p> 
               <p>"It is beautiful; I shall show it to James."</p> 
               <p>"Thanks to him, I have learned more than if I had attended Miss Wiglum's school."</p> 
               <p>I laughed, and told Polly I was coming to see her cheeses. Aunt Nabby pronounces them first rate, and she is not given to over-praise.</p> 
               <p>"I have done my best: they will bring quite a sum."</p> 
               <p>"Is the cow paid for, Polly?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes. Father is greatly pleased. My efforts have given him new courage. He is arranging to repair the barn, so that the stock may be kept in better condition."</p> 
               <p>"You are a wonderful girl, Polly."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, no, Jessie; I have only done my duty."</p> 
               <p>I could scarcely await James' arrival. As I had anticipated, he was surprised at the painting.</p> 
               <p>The next Saturday he brought two paint-boxes, thoroughly furnished. "I could give one to Polly. Painting flowers was a pretty feminine accomplishment,-he should be happy to see me proficient in the art."</p> 
               <p>In August, the parson preached his farewell discourse. The congregation were deeply affected; altogether, it was a very doleful day.</p> 
               <p>The parsonage seemed sad and lonely without the cheerful, benignant clergyman. Peggy was terribly huffy,-everything went wrong.</p> 
               <p>Candidates for the vacant pulpit immediately presented themselves, and as they were our guests, we made the acquaintance of several young ministers.</p>

               <head type="sub">MY FIRST SUITOR.</head> 
               <p>ONE Saturday afternoon in September, as I was busy drawing, Peggy entered the sitting-room with the exclamation, "La, sakes, Jessie, who do you s'pose this dandy is?"</p> 
               <p>Glancing through the window, I saw that a young man on horseback had entered the yard; from his clerical dress and saddle bags, I concluded that he was to be the officiating minister of the morrow. As my aunt was absent, attending a sick friend, I rose to receive the stranger.</p> 
               <p>Job having taken his horse, he came in, and with a profusion of bows introduced himself as the Rev. Mr. Rodes.</p> 
               <p>I apologized for my aunt's absence, and having shown him his chamber and the library, and begged him to feel perfectly at home, took my drawing to the parlor.</p> 
               <p>My guest joined me directly. The young candidate was small and effeminate; his hair, worn in long ear-locks, was craped and powdered; his clothes were of the finest material arid most fashionable cut. Bristol diamond knee and shoe buckles, a showy watch-chain and key, with a bunch of seals, and a gold finger-ring, completed this unusually foppish garb for one in his office.</p> 
               <p>With an assumption of dignified gravity, he walked round the room, examined the portraits, then seated himself by the table at which I was at work.</p> 
               <p>Dwight, who had gone to Boston for a week, had directed me to practise outlining leaves in India ink during his absence. The beauty of fern having attracted my attention, I was striving to transcribe a leaf to paper, and fancied I was succeeding very well. I had a correct eye, some taste, and much love for my work, and with such a teacher as Dwight, and only nature for a model, I could not fail to progress rapidly.</p> 
               <p>I was thinking how pretty my leaf looked, yet how inferior it was to the original, though that was only the wild herbage of the roadside, when my companion exclaimed, "You are quite expert with the pencil, Miss; it seems to me I would have chosen a less homely subject."</p> 
               <p>Homely! that fern homely! Surely, there were those with eyes that saw not. If the clergyman could see no beauty there, it would be useless to discuss the subject, so I quietly replied that "My teacher had directed me to draw leaves, and as that was rather difficult, I thought it good practice."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, indeed! who is your teacher?"</p> 
               <p>As Dwight was absent, I ventured to say, a young man from Boston, who is studying with Master Neal.</p> 
               <p>"Indeed! Hem! Does not Miss Norton teach in this parish?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes; I have been her pupil the past summer."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, yes, indeed,-hem; then you know the lady?-Hem-a very elegant, accomplished young person. I should suppose she could give you the best instruction in every branch of accomplishments."</p> 
               <p>I replied that I had profited by her tuition.</p> 
               <p>"Ah, yes, no doubt; you could not do otherwise."</p> 
               <p>Leaning back in his chair, balancing the tips of his upraised fingers together, with a most solemn face and serious tone, he added: "I think little of these mere externals, worldly vanities and shows. We are dying creatures; that ought ever to be our first consideration. The first thought at uprising, the last as we sink to repose. Every object and employment ought to conduce to the end of showing us our infinite littleness, our worthlessness and sinfulness in the wrathful eye of an offended Deity. Therefore, if precious time, the time given us to save our souls from hell, is devoted to works of a merely fanciful nature, proper subjects ought to be sought, such as shall lead the mind to a contemplation of its mortality."</p> 
               <p>I suggested that I had been taught that the mind, or spirit, was immortal.</p> 
               <p>"Hem-ah, yes, hem-yes; I did not express myself with sufficient perspicuity. I intended to infer that time should be spent in a manner to unfold the vanity of earth, the contiguity of hell, the shortness of time and the never-ending eternity gaping at our very feet."</p> 
               <p>Certainly; waste of time was a sin for which all were accountable.</p> 
               <p>"True, very true, Miss Bradshaw; I am happy to see so young a lady alive to this fact. Feeling thus, I wonder you do not leave this trifle, and paint a mourning piece. Miss Norton has some lovely specimens of art; I strongly recommend you should place yourself under her instruction again at once. By keeping our griefs and losses constantly in the foreground of existence, seeing the world as it is, one vast sepulchre through which its denizens are walking in one vast, funeral procession, we may lead bur thoughts from things of time to those of eternity. It is written, that it is better to go to the house of mourning than to the house of feasting."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, and it is also written: there is a time for all things; a time to be merry and rejoice as well as to mourn and lament. Could he not educe instruction from the fern as well as the mourning-piece?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, indeed-hem; really, he had not considered. What could I offer upon the subject?"</p> 
               <p>"An hour ago it was fresh and green, now it is drooping, an hour hence ft will be withered and dead; still, its component parts are only changed, not annihilated nor lost, but will again appear in some new form,-perhaps one of greater interest and beauty."</p> 
               <p>"Ah, yes. Quite poetical-but-"</p> 
               <pb n="62 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6399-00000034"/> 
               <p>What that "but" portended, I was not destined to know, the conversation being interrupted, much to my relief, by the arrival of Miss Norton and Ann. Both were prettily surprised at finding Parson Rodes, who I found was a townsman of the former lady. Notwithstanding their declaration to the contrary, I strongly suspected that they had been apprised of his coming. My aunt now returned, and, after a graceful demur, the young ladies were persuaded to lay aside their bonnets and stay to tea.</p> 
               <p>"They had not thought of stopping, but it was pleasant to meet an old friend, etc" These compliments passed for what they were worth with my aunt as well as myself. We both knew Miss Norton came with the intention of making the most of her "dear old friend's" society.</p> 
               <p>Ann soon expressed an unwonted interest in the flower-beds beneath the end-windows. I invited her to visit them; as we returned into the hall, I caught my name, coupled with "great heiress," and shrewdly suspected I was the subject of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tte-a-tte</foreign> between Mr. Rodes and my former teacher, who had been left together, while my aunt glanced at the tea-table.</p> 
               <p>Before sunset, our visitors departed. The minister repaired to the library, and the usual Saturday night stillness ensued. I was glad of the quiet, for a slight headache had increased to a painful degree, and I soon sought my pillow, but obtained little rest. The morning found me dizzy and sick.</p> 
               <p>"How pale you look, Jessie; is your head no better?" kindly inquired my aunt, as I crept down to prayers.</p> 
               <p>I explained that I had been unable to sleep, and felt very miserable.</p> 
               <p>"She must have some 'arb tea right away," said Peggy, placing her hand on my forehead.</p> 
               <p>As my aunt acquiesced, Peggy telling the minister that she would be back directly, ran up stairs to the garret, her herb depository.</p> 
               <p>With a sympathizing air, Mr. Rodes rose from the large, leathern-covered arm-chair, and insisted upon my taking it. I much preferred my own low chair, but to prevent words, complied with his desire.</p> 
               <p>"Won't you have a pillow, Jessie?" said my aunt, as she drew one from the press bed. I had not time to reply, before the young divine had seized it, and with gentle care had arranged it for my support. I saw my aunt's amused look, and sick as I was, could not help wondering at such unusual attention.</p> 
               <p>Peggy returned, and the morning worship commenced. After breakfast, feeling chilly, I sought the kitchen, seating myself on the form in the corner. In a moment, Mr. Rodes came in, with a pair of crimping irons in his hand. "Might he heat the tongs in the coals?"</p> 
               <p>"Certainly."</p> 
               <p>With many expressions of sorrow at my illness, he stood beside me till the irons were sufficiently warm, then inquired, "If Peggy would be so kind as to crimp and powder his hair!"</p> 
               <p>Peggy, with a great face, sat the little parson clown in a chair in the centre of the room: pinning her apron over his shoulders, she went to work.</p> 
               <p>First, the earlocks were combed and crimped with the irons, then the back hair, was frizzed into a puff, and the lower portion cued down and fastened with a ribbon, the whole having been whitened with powder, the dressing was complete.</p> 
               <p>Stepping back, Peggy took a leisurely and satisfied survey of her work. After a most minute scrutiny, she exclaimed, as she unpinned the apron, "There, I guess ye'll do! I shouldn't wonder if y'er head would fetch as

                   much as the asses at the siege of Samaria!"</p> 
               <p>I was obliged to retreat to the sitting-room. Aunt Compton was actually laughing,-an unusual thing for her, at any time, especially Sunday morning.</p> 
               <p>My head was so bad, that I was sent to my room, and placed on the sick list; my aunt would not leave me during the forenoon; but I grew so much better I insisted that she should attend the second service. "Peggy could go also, all I needed was quiet."</p> 
               <p>"She should do no sich thing, 'twas no use going, that jackanapes was no force, his sarmons hadn't none of the kernal, they was all bran."</p> 
               <p>"But, Peggy, you have heard but one sermon, he may improve on farther acquaintance."</p> 
               <p>"Don't you set yerself up to talk Shet y'er eyes, and go straight to sleep."</p> 
               <p>I was quite willing to obey, and fell into a refreshing nap, which lasted till the afternoon meeting was nearly over.</p> 
               <p>Opening my eyes, I perceived Peggy gazing earnestly from the window.</p> 
               <p>"I inquired what she was looking at?"</p> 
               <p>"A great flock of blackbirds have settled on the corn, they'd eat it all up 'fore night I raly believe."</p> 
               <p>I rose and went to the window; a field of corn near the house was literally black with the marauders.</p> 
               <p>"What a grand shot there is," said Peggy. "I wish Job had got home, his King's arm is loaded. How they do gobble it down! I used to be a pretty good shot, when I was a gal. I wonder if I couldn't skeer'em off?"</p> 
               <p>"Why, Peggy, you would shoot yourself."</p> 
               <p>"Not as ye knows on, gal; I was Bought up to the trade. Arter Sir died, Sammy used to be away in the out-fields a good part of the time, and I've killed many a crow and black-bird; once I shot a fox. I've a good mind to fire!"</p> 
               <p>"Why, Peggy, woman, it is Sunday, you are a worse infidel than the master!"</p> 
               <p>"Pho, I can quote scripter for it."</p> 
               <p>"What, for shooting blackbirds Sunday! Where?"</p> 
               <p>"Aint it written, that thou shalt pull thy ox or ass out o' the ditch Sabba day? If the corn that feeds the critters is in danger, we should save it. I'm gwine to fire."</p> 
               <p>"Don't, Peggy," I hurriedly interposed, but it was no use, she was below in a twinkling. Taking the King's arm from the brackets over the fireplace in the kitchen, she sallied forth, and fired with such good aim, that fifteen of the birds fell at the one shot.</p> 
               <p>I was so diverted, that forgetting. I was an invalid, I ran out to assist in collecting the spoil.</p> 
               <p>Meeting was just closing. The report of firearms at that hour excited the curiosity and alarm of the assembly; but Peggy and I had made good our retreat ere the congregation issued from the building.</p> 
               <p>It was amusing to watch the people as they came hurriedly forward, gazing in consternation up and down, hither and thither. "What had the noise been? Was it thunder? Was it a gun? It must have been supernateral! Something dredful was going to happen! Mabby 'twas 'caus Jafferson had been elected; he had n't shet up the meeten-us's yet, but nobody knew how soon he would. We ought to expect some judgmarnt with sich an infidel for a chief magistrate! Or perhaps it was the witches. No doubt Goody Sloper had a hand in it, if it was mischief. She did n't seem to do nothing, but they was sure she was in league with the evil one!"</p> 
               <p>Such were the exclamations bandied about, by the retiring congregation;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6399-00000036"/> and many that night, in their evening devotions, prayed with increased fervor for deliverance from evil. Peggy and I kept our own counsel; she covered the birds in a basket, and placed them in the chimney corner, to keep them warm till after sundown, when they were slyly picked and dressed.</p> 
               <p>I must own I felt some conscientious scruples; not so much at the killing the birds, as at the secrecy of the thing. Peggy bade me not be a ninny.</p> 
               <p>"She would make a pie fit for a king. Perhaps Job can bring down a few more in the morning." Having admitted Job to her confidence, he procured the number of game requisite for Peggy's pie; but the accommodating fellow declared it a hard job." Peggy's shot had shied 'em so, there wouldn't be much gunning among blackbirds very soon."</p> 
               <p>The pie was very nice, and Aunt Compton never dreamed but what it was made from Job's spoils. Long years elapsed ere the truth leaked out.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Rodes bade us adieu with many thinks, and the hope of my amended health upon his return at the end of the week, for we had learned that the society's committee had engaged him to preach through the month.</p> 
               <p>As the young man rode away, Peggy exclaimed, "La, Jessie, if you was a leetle older, I should expect to see Parson Frizzle carry you off in his saddle bags."</p> 
               <p>My aunt bade Peggy cease such nonsense. "She hoped it would be a long time before I thought of beaux."</p> 
               <p>"Hity, tity. Show me the gal in her teens that don't think on 'em! La, sakes, I had turned off nigh a dozen afore I made my choice, an' I was only eighteen when Edmund Carlton went to the war; and don't ye remember how yer blessed husband used to laugh, and tell how he fell in love with ye when you were nothing but a leetle school gal? Don't tell me boys and gals musn't think of one another; its nater, and all according to Gunter,-ra'al scripture doctrine."</p> 
               <p>Aunt Compton left the kitchen without reply, but an hour later, as we sat at work together, she asked, u How I should like to go to town to spend at few weeks with my aunts and Miss Betty Bradshaw."</p> 
               <p>Of course I should be delighted.</p> 
               <p>"The old meeting-house by the river side is to be taken down next week," she continued. "As I should like to sit once more in the spot where my first religious impressions were received in the sacred fane of childish recollections, I have concluded to go down Saturday, to stay till after the dedication of the fine new house of worship, so you can make your arrangements; do not forget anything, as I shall not limit your visit; it is time you saw a little of the great world."</p> 
               <p>Full of pleasing anticipations, I ran above stairs, to make the requisite selections from my wardrobe, while Peggy bustled up and down, washing, clear starching, ironing and crimping. After a busy week, everything was declared packed, and Saturday morning we set forth upon our short journey.</p> 
               <p>I leaned from the chaise and begged Peggy to take good care of Mr. Bodes, with the injunction to do his hair beautifully.</p> 
               <p>A funny face, and the caution to behave like a lady, were her parting benisons.</p> 
               <p>The ride down the main road on that clear September morning was enchanting. On either hand stretched stately woodlands and thriving homesteads, surrounded by fields, and orchards laden with autumnal harvest. Entering the lower parish, we passed the elegant seat of Mr. Donaldson, one of the merchant princes of that day; beyond rose the square meeting-house in the midst of its soft, velvety green; passing on, the country grew more level and open, and the spires of the town became visible.</p> 
               <p>"Here is the site of Queen Ann's chapel, Jessie," said my aunt, "the mother church of the present St. Paul's society. I recollect the old building distinctly."</p> 
               <p>"And there is the haunted house," exclaimed Job, who was our driver.</p> 
               <p>"Haunted house,-what, that old brown one? was it really haunted, Job?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, 'twas really haunted!"</p> 
               <p>"Why, Job, I don't believe you."</p> 
               <p>"'Twas surely; for an old cow wandered in at the open door and somehow got up the stairs, but couldn't get down agin. Nobody lived there, but the neighbors heerd the noise and were skeerd nigh about to death. 'Twas most a week afore a soul durst go into the chambers. It made the awfullest stir, as the poor beast moaned and lowed and trampled about most of the time. At last, a young lawyer from Port ventured up the stairs; poor Molly was but just alive, but they got her down safe and sound, and she lived to do good service for many years arter."</p> 
               <p>Much amused at Job's story, I leaned still farther forward, to gather in the opening glimpses of the handsome town, Passing the Plains cemetery, we entered the high street, not then the beautiful embowered avenue of later times, but a plain road with dwellings sparsely scattered amidst intervening fields.</p> 
               <p>Farther on, the buildings became more and more pretentious: then came several palatial mansions. Job reined up the horse, to allow me a good view of Dexter's house and images, which were then in their pristine glory.</p> 
               <p>Declaring that it was a shame to have the fine Jackson residence thus spoiled. Aunt Compton ordered Job to drive on. "She would not please the silly fool by stopping to look at his absurdities."</p> 
               <p>Turning past the Morse house, famous in the annals of witchcraft, we drew up before my Uncle Rutledge's residence, a much finer one than he had occupied upon my last visit; but the firm of "Rutledge &amp; Lee" were rising in importance; their establishment must befit their circumstances.</p> 
               <p>Before Job could lift the ponderous brass knocker, Aunt Sukey opened the door, and with Aunt Rutledge came forth to receive us. With pleasing cordiality, we were ushered into the best parlor. This apartment corresponded with the exterior in its enhancement of elegance. An English carpet and a slender-legged, deep-seated, chintz-covered sofa, and mahogany chairs, had taken the place of the wooden painted chairs and striped home-made carpet with which 1 had been familiar. A large mahogany sideboard, garnished with plate glass, replaced the birch table with the red, gilt-flowered tea-tray and painted china, which had been the admiration of my infancy. Handsome card tables and two large Dutch mirrors completed this very genteel furnishing.</p> 
               <p>After an half-hour's chat and the refreshment of cake and wine, we drove to Miss Betty Bradshaw's.</p> 
               <p>The old Bradshaw mansion which she had inherited, stood nearly at the extremity of the southerly side of Water street, and commanded an exquisite view of the river and bar, Salisbury point, Plum Island, and the, blue waters of Massachusetts Bay.</p> 
               <p>Our cousin was expecting us, and her neat house was in the most perfect order. The wrought flowers of her chair-covers and pictures vying with the gorgeous tints of the autumnal glories of the well kept garden, to which the narrow, small-paned casements in the rear opened. Everywhere the<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6399-00000037"/> maiden's industry and artistic skill were conspicuous; giving that attractiveness to the low-ceiled, dark wainscoted rooms and antique furniture, which feminine taste alone can produce, and without which the loftiest and most superb apartments are uninviting and cheerless.</p> 
               <p>After dinner, my cousin, Mira Rutledge, came to introduce me to the wonders of the town, the chief of which was the new meeting-house, which, from its unusually fine architecture, and elegant spire, had become the attraction of the period.</p> 
               <p>How lofty, spacious and convenient it was, in comparison to our old structure. I wondered if Dwight's church was as handsome. Having mounted the pulpit, gallery, and the lower glass house, from which a most magnificent prospect was obtained, my cousin proposed that we should take a look at the old house, which was to fee vacated the next day. Accordingly, we walked down to what is now Market square, and gazed at the time-embrowned pile, whose site at present is marked by the city pump.</p> 
               <p>Little did the founders of this first church deem how soon its precincts would become a business mart. Around rose lofty warehouses, save on the river side, where a long, irregular line of butchers shambles indicated the spot where the present market now stands.</p> 
               <p>Old and tottering, hoary with age, its use and beauty gone, it was meet that the venerable church should be removed; but I could not but feel a sad, yearning tenderness for this ancient sanctuary of my fathers.</p> 
               <p>This relic of an epoch then fast passing, was similar to our parish meeting-house; there were the same square pews, with their handsome balustered sides, the seats for males and females, the high pulpit, sounding-board and deacon's seat; but a few years previous, to the concern of many, an innovation had been introduced in the shape of an organ. Great was the tumult! Some left the meeting, denouncing the instrument as a papistical invention, a real popish fiddle. Loud had been the invectives against the "tooting tub" and "sarving the divil on an orgin." The pastor of a rival congregation had learnedly and logically demonstrated the enormity of giving ear to this "<hi rend="i"/>Devil's box of whistles." Notwithstanding all this disturbance, the organ kept its place, discoursing sacred melody from Sabbath to Sabbath.</p> 
               <p>I never had seen an organ, and was greatly impressed, the next morning, as I seated myself in Miss Betty's pew, by its lofty case, crimson, drapery, and golden pipes, and impatiently awaited the first note.</p> 
               <p>At length the old and invalid pastor and his young colleague entered, the deacons and the tithing-man were in their places, the house filled and grew quiet. The young minister read a hymn without aid from a deacon,-that was a novelty; but when the organ pealed forth and the choir rose, I leaned back with closed eyes in a perfect ecstasy. How very near that hymn carried me to heaven! Oh, that the spirit always had such pinions to upbear them above earthly care and sorrow! As the elder pastor was to bid the final adieu, the younger clergyman performed the morning service. In the afternoon, the house was thronged, and the final farewell was most impressive. True, this was given to only wood and stone, but how had that wood and stone become entwined about the hearts of the audience! What floods of memories swept past, as, they gazed at the time-stained walls!</p> 
               <p>At that font they had been baptized, hither had their childish steps been led, here their first religious hope received. Hither had they come in the flush of joy and health, and in the prostration of grief and age. Here they had stood at the bridal and the burial, in weal and in Woe, with aged parents, beloved brethren, wives and children now gathered to the Lord's garner above Surely, this had been none other than the house of the Lord, and the gate of praise.</p> 
               <p>The beloved old pastor rose, after the opening exercises, and with much of his youthful eloquence, preached from the sixty-third psalm, second verse: "To see Thy power and Thy glory, so as I have seen Thee in the sanctuary." He spoke of our dependence upon the Creator, of our social duties and privileges, of the delight and profit of thus assembling together for worship, and expressed the hope, that, though that house was soon to be levelled with the dust, that it should not be finally lost to any, but remain in the happy effects of an attendance there. "With such a temper," he continued, "they would give farewell to the temple where God had been served through the long space of one hundred and forty-one years. All those who took an active part in its erection have long since slept in the dust. But we would humbly hope and believe, that many souls, now in glory, have been assisted and strengthened in their way thither; and there are others still living, who in the sincerity of their hearts can say: Here Christ hath met me-here he hath blessed me.</p> 
               <p>"I may not finish without observing, that according to the serious and thoughtful disposition with which you leave the <emph>old house,</emph> you may hope, through Christ, for an acceptance into the new one, and I pray God that he may beautify his temple, far beyond those decorations of art, which give it so splendid an <emph>external</emph> appearance, and which attract our notice, with so very sensible a pleasure.</p> 
               <p>"May we bear in mind, that it is not long that any of us can worship in the sanctuary here below; but blessed be our God, 'there is an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.' There may we catty our views; for that state be ripening. God, of his infinite mercy, grant that we all meet at last in the heavenly mansions, and be of that happy number, who shall stand at the right hand of Christ, and spend a blissful eternity together."</p> 
               <p>After a farewell prayer and hymn, the congregation dispersed, with glistening eyes and lingering steps.</p> 
               <p>As James had pronounced me a perfect scarecrow, and emphatically decided that my outgrown mourning would not do for the dedication, Aunt Compton had arranged to take me shopping Monday morning; but a nervous headache, induced by the exertion and agitation of the previous day, compelled her to devote the period to rest. As Miss Betty was busy preparing for guests expected at the consecration, I was directed to ask Aunt Sukey's assistance; but as I sallied forth, I became forcibly impressed with the grandeur of doing up the job myself. Everybody would be engaged on this Monday morning; surely I was old enough to take the care of my wardrobe.</p> 
               <p>Full of these important ideas, I hurried up the street, and soon descried the handsome sign of "Rutledge &amp; Lee." Approaching, I saw that workmen had already begun the demolishing of the old meeting-house, from which the organ was at that instant borne forth.</p> 
               <p>Crossing to the fashionable pave, I entered a three-storied brick store, which extended to a narrower and less fashionable, but more crowded thoroughfare in the rear.</p> 
               <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6399-00000038"/> 
               <p>The front apartment of this spacious building was devoted to dry goods; the back, to groceries. As the firm carried on a large town and country trade, besides being extensively engaged in the shipping interest, the chambers above and the cellars beneath, were crowded with merchandise and produce. While elegant equipages and aristocratic belles frequented the fashionable front store, wagons, carts and drays, traders, countrymen, seamen, etc., thronged the commercial mart beyond.</p> 
               <p>At my request, one of the spruce, young clerks went in quest of Mr. Lee, who was superintending matters at the meeting-house.</p> 
               <p>My guardian came directly, and confirmed me in my self-reliance.</p> 
               <p>"Certainly; I was old enough to choose my dresses."</p> 
               <p>As I was to go into half mourning, I selected a piece of black and white changeable silk.</p> 
               <p>"Are you sure that you prefer this? shall you not change your mind?" he asked, as he measured it off.</p> 
               <p>"No; when I once decide, I never alter my mind."</p> 
               <p>"Then I have the honor to possess a feminine rara-avis. What shall you get for a bonnet?"</p> 
               <p>"The honor to possess a feminine rara-avis." <emph>Possess!</emph> I was none of his belongings; so, somewhat frigidly, I asked how one made from that same silk would look.</p> 
               <p>"Charmingly; you have a capital taste, Pet. Mrs. Selby is of course your milliner. Tell her to fashion the hat exactly like that French one of Miss Kate Donaldson's."</p> 
               <p>Promising to do so, I left with a direction to the dressmaker. Miss Lane, now a fashionable town, modiste, kept me some time chatting over home news; and the artistic Mrs. Selby detained me still longer, with exhibitions of her skill on Mrs. Judge P--'s caps, Madame Donaldson's turbans, and Miss Kate's trimmings. I must go into the little parlor back of the shop, and examine many things on which to report to my aunt, "who must need something for the dedication." It was near noon before I got back to the store. James was ready to wait upon me, and I at once proceeded to finish my shopping.</p> 
               <p>As my guardian was about to roll up the goods, Aunt Rutledge, Aunt Sukey, and Mira came in.</p> 
               <p>"Why, James!" exclaimed Aunt Rutledge, as she looked over the pile, "how came you to countenance this extravagance? A camel's hair shawl, silk stockings, and Mechlin lace! why, Jessie, do you know the cost of these articles?"</p> 
               <p>"No, indeed, I had not thought of inquiring the price of a single thing. James had shown the goods; I had selected them, and he had praised my choice."</p> 
               <p>"That is just a masculine procedure. Encourage ladies to dress in the most costly and fashionable manner, then raise a muss on account of their extravagance," said Aunt Sukey. "Look at these white kids, and as I live, half a dozen of those two-dollar linen cambric handkerchiefs! That is too much, James: one or two of these, and some long lawn would have done just as well."</p> 
               <p>I was greatly disconcerted, and replied that I thought I was rich enough to buy what I liked.</p> 
               <p>"No one ought to waste, Jessie, and wealth is so uncertain you ought to learn economy when young," replied Aunt Rutledge.</p> 
               <p>"Papa tells me not to mind Ma's croaking," Mira laughingly interposed.</p> 
               <p>"It is not croaking, my daughter. I trust that evil days may never come; but I fear that this prosperity will not always continue. Your father and James have already lost by these European troubles, and quite a portion of Jessie's father's estate has also gone."</p> 
               <p>This was all news to me. I had never given a thought to my property, and knew not a single thing respecting it. In reply to the questioning look directed to my guardian, he replied: "Do not be frightened, Jessie; your father was largely engaged in commerce at his death, and though one or two vessels were seized and confiscated, the others made such prosperous voyages that no great loss was sustained. I am investing your fortune as safely as possible. You are becoming quite a landholder. All these new stores to the right are yours, and that long wharf. I think you may safely indulge in a few nice handkerchiefs and stockings. True economy is shown in the care of a wardrobe. Purchase as good and durable an article as your means will allow; then keep it well, and you will be ready for any emergency."</p> 
               <p>Much relieved, but with the determination to become perfectly acquainted with the state of my property, and the extent of my income, I followed my aunts and cousin to a chamber above, where seats had been provided for the accommodation of those lady friends who might be desirous to witness the levelling of the old meeting-house. The room soon became filled with a fashionably dressed throng. Wine and cordials were brought from the cellar, glasses sent for, and a very gay scene ensued.</p> 
               <p>Every support having been withdrawn from the doomed edifice, with the exception of one corner, a hawser was attached, and the surrounding crowd forced back, then with a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull altogether, the ancient house came down with a terrible crash, amidst a blinding dust, and the huzzas of the multitude.</p> 
               <p>The primitive church had passed into a heap of rubbish, thenceforward to be only a memory of the olden time.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE DEDICATION.</head> 
               <p>THE long-anticipated first of October at length arrived. At an early hour, the town became thronged, as the fame of the new meeting-house had spread far and wide.</p> 
               <p>Contrary to promise, my bonnet had not been sent. James fumed and fidgetted, then despatched his page, Jake, with an irate message to the delinquent milliner.</p> 
               <p>I much wondered what the boy would make of the errand, for Jake was a small specimen of the semi-barbarous "Shoalers," and depicted a perfectly unique specimen of humanity.</p> 
               <p>Considerable trade was at that time carried on between the Isle of Shoals and the main land. Jake had been brought to civilized society by a skipper of one of the craft engaged in this business.</p> 
               <p>Horses and carriages were unknown articles in the ocean Isles, but cows and windmills were numerous.</p> 
               <p>Half an hour after Jake's disembarkation, as he stood in the door of Rut-ledge &amp; Lee's store, gazing about in gaping wonder, he espied a horse and chaise driving down the street. Rushing up to my guardian, he seized his arm, screaming, "Cappen Lee, Cappen Lee, look, look! here's a cow without horns running away with a windmill!"</p> 
               <p>James was so much diverted with this speech, and the odd phiz of the untutored lad, that he immediately enlisted him in his service, a place which he filled in a most faithful but strikingly original manner.</p> 
               <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6399-00000039"/> 
               <p>My guardian's confidence in the lad's obtaining the bonnet was not misplaced. He soon appeared, hurriedly conveying a girl with a bandbox.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Selby sent a profusion of excuses,-"But there had been such a press of business, as every lady had ordered something new for the dedication"; and her handmaiden would not leave until the new hat was tied on, that she might see that it was perfectly <foreign xml:lang="FRA">au fait.</foreign>
               </p> 
               <p>The great bell-crowned head-gear having been duly admired, I drew on my long, white kid gloves, and wrapping my new camel's hair in graceful folds, with James hurried up the street.</p> 
               <p>I saw my guardian's gratified look, and was conscious that I was dressed most becomingly, was perfectly aware of the pride with which he led me up the church steps, and through the crowded porch.</p> 
               <p>The family, to secure seats, had preceded us. It was with some difficulty that I was squeezed into my Uncle Rutledge's pew. To make room, Mira and I perched ourselves upon the broad window-seat.</p> 
               <p>As I was admiring the grace with which my elegant guardian escorted ladies to pews, I encountered a pair of eyes which instantly lowered mine. At that moment Mira whispered, u Look in the opposite gallery, Jessie, there are Master Neal and Dwight Sprague."</p> 
               <p>So there were; I had not noticed the Master. I had not expected that Dwight would return so soon; I wondered if he had missed me; of course I should not ask, but I secretly hoped that he would say.</p> 
               <p>At the appointed hour, the two pastors, with several other clergymen and other distinguished strangers, entered The house was already full; it soon became densely thronged, and the very interesting dedication service commenced.</p> 
               <p>After appropriate anthems, hymns, and prayers, came an excellent sermon delivered by the younger pastor, from the one hundredth Psalm, fourth verse.</p> 
               <p>"Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, and into His courts with praise; be thankful unto Him and bless His name."</p> 
               <p>In a most solemn and impressive manner the preacher set apart the house for worship,-dedicated it to the Most High God; implored Him there to meet his people, and accept them through His well beloved Son, the gracious Redeemer; prayed that there the pure doctrines of Christianity might be taught, its sacred precepts be forcibly inculcated, its glorious promises clearly unfolded, and its awful threatenings faithfully denounced.</p> 
               <p>Finally, he besought his hearers "to live under a realizing sense of this eternal truth. <q>

               </p> 
               <p>As Aunt Compton and I were to dine at my Uncle Rutledge's, Aunt Rutledge despatched James to invite Master Neal and his pupil.</p> 
               <p>They joined us as we came forth. With a very low bow, Dwight complimented me on my extremely genteel appearance. "I scarcely knew you, Jessie; how dress alters one! I really think my fine Boston cousins would consider you presentable to-day, but don't get too superfinerous, pray. When are you coming home, to be a nice, unsophisticated country girl?"</p> 
               <p>"Not for this long while; she is going to school with me. What do you say to that?" Mira mischievously inquired.</p> 
               <p>"That I am a victim to the most cruel fate must end my miserable existence in the lowest depths of despair," he replied, in such a comically tragic air that the conversation ended in a merry peal of laughter.</p> 
               <p>But, in the course of the afternoon, my young friend inquired, "If I really intended to remain long after my aunt's return?"</p> 
               <p>I did not know; perhaps I might stay through the winter.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, don't, Jessie, I implore and beseech; it is so lonely without you."</p> 
               <p>"Why, you have Polly; and better still, the angelic Ann."</p> 
               <p>"Take care, Miss, or I shall actually pinch you! Thank fortune that I have Polly, for I am positively going to turn that new leaf, and prepare for college, and she will help me study much more than you, Miss Wisdom."</p> 
               <p>"Are you in earnest? really decided to enter college?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes; I can't say that it is perfectly satisfactory, but it will be better than trade; I should die in a counting-house."</p> 
               <p>"Going to college," exclaimed Mira; "what are you going to be? a minister?"</p> 
               <p>"Would you advise it, Miss Mira?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, certainly; you are so admirably fitted for one, that everybody must recognize the appropriateness of the thing."</p> 
               <p>"Many a truth has been uttered in jest, Miss Mira, I could incite the adoration of the young ladies, and the more elderly, with tearful eyes would expatiate upon the heavenly gifts of the godly young minister. With solemn tones, the dear souls would pronounce him St. John, Erasmus, Luther, Calvin, Melancthon, and John Rogers in the primer, all united in one."</p> 
               <p>My reproval at this levity upon sacred themes only elicited the declaration, "that Goody Sloper was a false witch. Instead of my heart being broken, there was much more probability that his would be reduced to powder."</p> 
               <p>Would the youth ever grow rational? Mira hoped not. "She was in love with him, intended to become my rival immediately."</p> 
               <p>"What, and jilt Tom Carnes?"</p> 
               <p>"Tom Carnes! How foolish! she had considered her Cousin Jessie more sensible!"</p> 
               <p>After Aunt Compton's return, I remained at my Aunt Rutledge's, and accompanied my cousin to Master Shorts' school, but his iron sway, and the rudeness of many of the scholars, excited great disgust. The course of instruction was similar to that to which I had been accustomed; a few of the boys studied a pair of globes that garnished the master's desk; but the girls were restricted to the mere elementary department.</p> 
               <p>During an afternoon spelling match, a small pupil, for some misdemeanor, was decreed to run the gantlet at the close of the recitation. Much wondering what this new punishment could be, I impatiently awaited, while the words went back and forth down the long class. The column through, the feminine portion were remanded to their seats, while the boys ranged into two opposite lines; joining hands they formed an arch through which the struggling, screaming culprit was ruthlessly thrust upon his hands and knees, each two boys bringing down their clasped hands with a resounding whack upon his devoted body as he strove forward. The cries of the bewildered, bruised and helpless lad were terrible; the whole scene, sickening and barbarous. Mira and I, with most of the girls, crouched beneath the desks, our heads buried in our aprons, vainly striving to stifle the shrieks and moans of the little delinquent. The line at length having been passed, soiled and bloody the boy was left upon the floor. After a pause, faint, giddy, and half blind, he managed to rise, and reel to his seat. At dismissal, half a dozen of the older<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6399-00000040"/> girls, with womanly kindness and pity, bathed his face, arranged his clothes, and sent him homeward if not rejoicing, at least comforted.</p> 
               <p>Aunt Rutledge was shocked at our account of the proceeding, and declared that her daughter should not commence another term. James preferred my taking lessons of Miss Betty, to regular school attendance. "Her garden furnished fine models for my pencil, and I would otherwise profit from an intimate association with a refined gentlewoman like Miss Bradshaw."</p> 
               <p>This sojourn with my father's cousin, also brought a love which my ambitious, aristocratic, world-enthralled guardian had not counted; that love which must come from daily communion with any of the great sublimities of nature. Hitherto, my experience had been confined to woodland, field, rock and hill, interspersed by babbling brooklet, glassy lake and silvery stream; a widespread circuit of rural life, bounded by distant mountain peaks, and long threads of sandy shores, beyond which, stretched lines of ocean imperceptibly mingling with the cerulean of the sky, or broken into foamy crests that blended with the gray horizon or the drifting cloud rift.</p> 
               <p>Now, just across the narrow street extended the wide river, with its tributary on the right, pouring in its waters to swell the broad expanse; beyond, the sentinel sand-points reached their barring arms to the narrow outlet, as if to guard the quiet stream from the rude billows of that mighty ocean that dashed and swelled, furlong after furlong, far off into the misty distance. Day after day I watched the shifting lights and tints, ever varying, ever new. One hour, a mirror-like sheen reflecting house, tree, sail and cloud; the next, dark, neutral waves, turgid and somber. Untiringly, I revelled in the glorious beauty of the blue waters and golden sands, the glittering sails of the in-coming and out-going sail-boats, fishing-smacks and West India schooners, or the more distant ships gliding across the bay, majestically sailing into the unkenned space afar; watched and listened to the musical dash and dip of oars as the huge gondolas, hay-freighted from the outspreading meadows, moved slowly past; or to the lighter, quicker stroke, mingled with laugh and song, as a pleasure dory or fishing-wherry went by.</p> 
               <p>Night after night I sat by my window, lulled into delicious placitude by the murmuring cadence and musical rhythm of the waves, as they gently plashed upon the beach silvered by the moonbeams; or, awe-struck and shuddering, peered into the darkness, as the angry billows boomed and broke over the bar, towering up into the rainy sky as if eager to swallow the guardian towers, whose red lights glowed in the mid distance like the two fiery eyes of some monster of a fairy tale.</p> 
               <p>Then there was the new life of the suburban portion of a maritime and fishing town. The noise and turmoil of the busy wharves, the various novel sights, sounds and smells, the loading and unloading of vessels, the rumbling carts, trucks and drays, with the cries and shouts of sailors, laborers and teamsters. The long, irregular rows of fishermen's huts, with their white-haired, bare-footed children sailing chips in the tiny pools and eddies of the flats, and the brawny fish-wives in brown, homespun short gown and petticoat tucked to the knee, ankle deep on the strand, aiding their other halves in taking the fish from the boats, and bearing them to the great fish-flakes below the long ropewalks. All this was a life as new as suggestive, one as expanding and enlivening as the broad waters that had so unwittingly become my instructors.</p> 
                
               <p>A few mornings after my return to Miss Betty's, I was surprised by a call from the fashionable and distinguished Miss Kate Donaldson. This lady, the only child of the wealthy Mr. Donaldson, though far advanced in her twenties, still affected the air and dress of sixteen. Previous to my guardian's visit abroad, she had been remarkably gracious and condescending; since his return, this had changed to a familiar affability, as flattering as it was charming. This evident partiality had become a standing joke in the family.</p> 
               <p>But though perfectly sensible of the prestige attached to those select few who were counted amongst Miss Kate's particular friends, my elegant cousin pursued a non-committal policy, which showed that his heart was as yet untouched.</p> 
               <p>Miss Kate, a petite, airy creature, with a clear, pale complexion, and a profusion of light, flossy ringlets, with great empressment, flew toward me, and seizing my hand, declared her pleasure at the meeting. "I only returned from Boston yesterday, my dear, or you would have had an earlier welcome. Now, get your bonnet, ma chere, and come to pass the day with me. I have seen that horrible Blue-Beard guardian, and he has given his august permission; has even condescended to promise the light of his countenance in the evening."</p> 
               <p>I scarcely knew how to reply, but Miss Betty relieved my embarrassment and assisted me to prepare for the visit. Proceeding to the "Court End," we entered a large, square, three-storied mansion; a lawn, shaded by elms in front, and, a paved court leading to a stable and coach-house in the rear. Giving my bonnet to a servant, Miss Kate led the way to the parlor, where I was introduced to her mother, a fat, red-faced woman in a stiff silk and crape turban.</p> 
               <p>The apartment was much more superb than any I had before entered, but my attention was quickly turned from the rich furnishing to several portraits decorating the walls. One, that of a lady in a dress of blue satin, with the antique bodice, full skirt and demiopen sleeves, finished with double lace ruffles and stomacher to match, ear jewels and necklace of pearls, and hair brushed from the forehead and turned over a "roll" at the back, instantly riveted my admiring gaze. Very beautiful, in the dawn of womanhood, she stood in a wood, through which stole gleams of a glowing summer sunset; One hand hung gracefully at her side; the other, outstretched, caught the sparkling drops from an old-fashioned aqueduct.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Miss Kate, how magnificent! What a lovely creature, and I never saw such a splendid painting!"</p> 
               <p>"Yes; Aunt Kitty was very pretty; she died when only twenty, and this portrait was painted a few months prior to her death by the distinguished artist, Copley. You show your taste in appreciating this picture; few would so quickly have perceived its superiority."</p> 
               <p>"I have heard Dwight Sprague speak of Copley; he painted the portraits of his parents."</p> 
               <p>"Yes; and they are most magnificent pictures. I believe the artist considered them among his very best."</p> 
               <p>"Dwight says they gave him his first true ideas of art."</p> 
               <p>"Then Master Dwight opines that he has true ideas," said Miss Kate, smilingly elevating her delicately pencilled eyebrows. "Modest, truly! He is a rare lad, and puts that austere uncle to his wit's end, much to my satisfaction."</p> 
               <p>The entrance of luncheon ended the conversation. The refreshment partaken, Miss Kate seated herself at her<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6399-00000041"/> embroidery frame, in which a scripture piece on black satin was nearly completed. In an arbor to the right, sat King David playing the harp; on a throne at the left, Solomon sat in judgment; in the centre, uprose tall trees of a nondescript species, one of which bore mammoth apples, which a man among the branches tossed to a woman beneath. Absalom hung in the centre tree, Joab transfixed him with his spear, while the unfortunate prince's horse gallopped wildly into the foreground, amid peacocks, rabbits, gazelles, fawns, and many strange flowers. Men and women paid court to the monarchs; a sun wrought in gold thread glittered above, and birds flew through the air.</p> 
               <p>This elaborate and brilliant piece of needle-work was a fair specimen of the embroidery of the period. Almost every one would have pronounced it splendid; but as I gazed at the Copley painting, and noted the perfection of outline and nicety of finish, the flexibility of the limbs and softness of skin, the living beauty of the hands and gorgeous drapery, the exquisite tracery of the lace, and the perfection of the hair, the truthfulness of light and shade, even to the shadow of the ruffles on the arm, the limpid grace of the trickling drops dripping upon the velvet sward, the exactness of the perspective, carrying the eye far out beyond the wood to a more open country, where ruddy cloud streaks lined the horizon, I could but wonder, that Miss Kate, with her culture, should spend time over such an incongruity. The peacocks were pretty and natural; I determined to work one life-size on white satin.</p> 
               <p>The one o'clock bell brought Mr. Donaldson, a tall, stately, taciturn personage, my beau-ideal of a great merchant, with the weight of a mighty business upon his mind.</p> 
               <p>Dinner was immediately announced. The board groaned under a load of the most costly plate and ware, and the richest of viands. One liveried servant waited at table, another presided at the sideboard. Three or four highly-seasoned and delicately cooked courses having been served, the repast ended with a luxurious dessert, accompanied by choice liquors. My host took brandy and water; his wife sipped a glass of hot gin-toddy; Miss Kate and I had wine.</p> 
               <p>The meal over, Mr. Donaldson lighted a long Dutch pipe. Madam Donaldson sought her room for a nap. Miss Kate took me over the house and garden.</p> 
               <p>She had plenty of amusing small talk, amongst others mentioned the Misses Sprague. I asked if she knew Dwight's relatives.</p> 
               <p>"Yes; but they are not over fond of him; his aunt, a good-natured, though somewhat fretful woman, is his best friend. Mr. Sprague intends building a handsome mansion on the ancestral domain in the Falls parish, in the spring."</p> 
               <p>I ventured to inquire respecting Dwight's mother.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, she was a perfect love, but Mr. Paul Sprague nor his wife could ever abide her. Rumor says she rejected Mr. Paul for his elder brother, and Madam Sprague was jealous of the superior charms of her sister-in-law.</p> 
               <p>"Papa thinks that Dwight is not treated as his father's son should be. He was his grandfather's especial pet, and it is surprising that he should not have been made co-heir with Mr. Sprague."</p> 
               <p>"Dwight cares little for money."</p> 
               <p>"Yes; and his talents will always command a fortune, but that is no excuse for injustice."</p> 
               <p>At six o'clock, tea was brought to the parlor, and handed on a silver salver in elegant china cups, accompanied by an exquisitely chased silver ewer, sugar urn, and slop basin.</p> 
               <p>My guardian entered soon after the candles had been lighted,-tall tapers in graceful, silver branches either side of the chimney-piece.</p> 
               <p>At his request, Miss Kate played the guitar, accompanying the instrument with a sweet, well-trained voice. She looked youthful and pretty in her white muslin, with the soft curls falling over her white shoulders.</p> 
               <p>Madam Donaldson summoned James to a game of cards. Much to my amazement, I found that my cousin was an adept in a pastime upon which I had been taught to look with horror.</p> 
               <p>My ideas were, I found, receiving rapid expansion. At ten, a hot supper was served. As this was something to which I was unaccustomed, I declined taking anything, but Madam Donaldson would not listen to a word.</p> 
               <p>"Not eat supper! why, how did I expect to grow?"</p> 
               <p>James thought I might indulge in a bit of chicken, and Mr. Donaldson insisted upon helping me to punch.</p> 
               <p>"Punch was wholesome: made folks sleep well,"</p> 
               <p>As Miss Kate bade us good-night, she expressed a wish to take me to St. Paul's church the next Sunday. I was happy to accept the invitation, as I had long cherished the desire to attend the "Piscopal meetin" as Peggy termed it.</p> 
               <p>James inquired, as we walked home, "If I had spent a pleasant day?" I replied in the affirmative, shyly intimating my wonder at his indifference to Miss Kate's charms.</p> 
               <p>"She has plenty of beaux, Jessie."</p> 
               <p>"So she told me, adding, 'but like Queen Elizabeth, after being courted all her life, she believed she should die a maiden.'"</p> 
               <p>My guardian laughed, declaring, "That he could have sworn that to be one of Miss Kate's speeches had he heard it repeated by a stranger at the antipodes."</p> 
               <p>My slumbers were rather broken that night. I dreamed of going to church in a punch bowl, drawn by chickens, to witness the marriage of Miss Kate and Dwight Sprague, James acting as parson, in the blue robe of the Copley lady with Madam Donaldson's turban for a mitre.</p> 
               <p>Sunday morning, I rode with my new friends to St. Paul's in their handsome carriage, drawn by a superb span of bays, in a glittering harness, with coachman and footman in livery.</p> 
               <p>With awe, I passed through the porch and up the broad aisle of in reality the simple church which, to my, eyes, unaccustomed to any but the congregational meeting-house, presented the splendor of a magnificent temple</p> 
               <p>With serious wonder, I glanced from chancel to altar-piece, thence from reading-desk to pulpit. The pealing organ, the white-robed rector, the kneeling worshippers, the deep responses, grew more and more impressive. Bowing my head with closed eyes, I felt that I could fully appreciate Dwight's solemnity, and wondered if his church could be more splendid or reverentially inspiring.</p> 
               <p>That afternoon, I accompanied Miss Betty's maid to the Independent church to hear that celebrated English preacher, the Rev. Charles Milton, Miss Betty laughed at the contrast between my morning and evening escorts, but I was as happy walking beside Hannah Mixer, in her "hair-bine" gown, as I had been riding with the Donaldsons in their rich brocades.</p> 
               <p>The two-towered edifice was soon reached; we had scarcely entered a pew, when a short, thick-set man, with a broad, swarthy face, small glittering eyes, and a profusion of heavy, black curls falling over his collar, sprang up<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6399-00000042"/> in the pulpit with the impetus of a toy jumping jack, and with upraised hands in a stentorian voice shouted Diet's pray."</p> 
               <p>Completely electrified, I rose with a nervous tremor creeping from head to foot, but I was scarcely erect before the prayer was at an end.</p> 
               <p>I doubt not the word was expounded with power, but the speaker, with his queer eccentric manner, his startling changes and quick gestures, so worked upon my nerves that I actually grew hysterical. The end of the service brought positive relief.</p> 
               <p>I returned home at the month's end. Aunt Judy "was glad I'd come, Dwight was so unsettled; he painted too much." As I was examining the sketches he had made during my absence, I found a water-color drawing of a flock of sheep, grouped under a rocky precipice, that struck my fancy.</p> 
               <p>"How pretty this is," I exclaimed. "You ought to be an artist, Dwight."</p> 
               <p>"To that end was I born, but destiny forbids!'</p> 
               <p>"If it was possible, would you go to Europe to study?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes; though there is no teacher like the great Master of the universe. Why is it, that having eyes we see not? If it was my mission, I would strive to found an American school of art."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps it will be your mission. As yet I scarcely think the American people able to appreciate your ideas."</p> 
               <p>"True, the masses would prefer Miss Kate's Scripture-piece or Miss Norton's mourning urns. Well, I will prosecute my studies; I wish mathematics, etc., were more to my relish. The fact is, Jessie, I am sadly deficient in character. Polly Brown possesses twice the resolution I ever summoned."</p> 
               <p>I laughingly replied, "That self-knowledge was an excellent thing, and I thought he might get on with such superior models as Polly and myself."</p> 
               <p>Contrary to expectation, Mr. Rodes again appeared at the parsonage. Under pretence of an invitation to visit throughout the parish, we found he was to be our guest through the week.</p> 
               <p>His foolish foppery disgusted my aunt. Peggy made him the butt of several practical jokes; even the sober Job grinned behind his back, and his obsequious attentions to myself grew daily more annoying.</p> 
               <p>Friday afternoon, fretted past endurance, Aunt Compton proposed a visit to South-end. Purposely prolonging our stay till late in the evening, the little parson had no pretext for lingering below after "prayers."</p> 
               <p>Bidding me good-night in the tenderest of tones, he mounted the stairs, and opened the door of his chamber, but, with a shriek of terror, it was as quickly closed, with a clang that shook the solid house on its foundation.</p> 
               <p>Job peered from his room and inquired the trouble, while I ran above, followed by my aunt and Peggy, with like queries.</p> 
               <p>With a white face, the little parson gasped from quivering lips, "Oh, the fiend! the foul fiend is in there-just at the bed's head-a great, grinning fiery monster, with eyes of flame. It must be Satan himself!"</p> 
               <p>"Pho," said Job, as he valiantly advanced to the rescue; "I guess you've mistook!"</p> 
               <p>"No, it is just on the pillow. It cannot be anything human! Do not go in alone, my good fellow, I beg."</p> 
               <p>Sho! I aint afeard of nothing in this here sanctified house," replied the undaunted yeoman, as he strode sturdily forward, whilst we feminines drew closer together, and the trembling parson ensconced himself behind Peggy.</p> 
               <p>Cautiously lifting the latch, Job drew the door slightly apart and warily peeped within. A long, shrill whistle, then it was flung back with a shout, disclosing, as the parson had said, a great, grinning, fiery monster, which cast a lurid glare over the long passage where we stood.</p> 
               <p>The parson reeled back with an exclamation of affright, while Job, fairly dancing with glee, cried, "Gorry, parson, it's nothing but a pumpkin lantern, though I'll allow its the darndest one I ever seed. Dwight Sprague must have carved it out,-nobody else could have fixed sich an infarnal critter."</p> 
               <p>My aunt cast an angry look at Peggy, as Job brought forth the harmless cause of the tumult, but her face was perfectly expressionless, and though we knew she must have been cognizant of the whole affair, if not an active participant, we never could persuade her to an acknowledgment.</p> 
               <p>Dwight pleaded guilty, with due contrition the next morning, but I had not much faith in his penitence.</p> 
               <p>His object was effected, for the little parson was summarily driven from the field. The story flew like wildfire, and the weak, foppish minister found it convenient to shorten his projected period of pulpit service.</p> 
               <p>The following winter, I again attended the district school, and strove to follow Polly Brown in arriving at Finis in Pike's Arithmetic.</p> 
               <p>The master was grimly furious. Just as if it was necessary for girls! If we had sufficient arithmetic to count our beaux and knots of yarn, it was enough. There was enough for women to do without their encroaching upon man's province."</p> 
               <p>Notwithstanding his spleen, we persevered, much to the admiration of the other scholars, and if he would have owned it, to that of the master also.</p> 
               <p>In March, I was sent to town, to benefit by the instruction of a fashionable teacher of some celebrity.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Lowe, a gay, fascinating widow, much admired by the opposite sex, at James' recommendation received me with marked attention. The course of study consisted of grammar, "The Young Ladies' Accidence" being the text-book; epistle and note writing, after the model of the "Complete Letter-Writer"; embroidery, singing, and playing the guitar.</p> 
               <p>I was now enabled to work the long-projected peacock, a feat which placed me in the front rank of Mrs. Lowe's show pupils.</p> 
               <p>This sedentary life began to tell upon my constitution.</p> 
               <p>In September, Dr. Norcross, with a grave shake of his bewigged head, ordered me back to the parsonage. I must have country air and exercise, resume the spinning wheel, and let accomplishments go to --a place considered hotter than agreeable. Dwight entered Harvard in August. He called to bid me good-by. Outwardly, he was the gayest of the gay, but by the shadow in his eyes, I knew that he was far from happy. The promise that I should soon hear from him was speedily redeemed. In a few-clays after his departure the "Post" brought me a letter. This was the first epistle I had ever received; how much my self-esteem was heightened, one may imagine. I feared that Aunt Compton or James might disapprove of this correspondence, but as no objection was raised, an answer was sent, which though very different from the style of the "Complete Letter-Writer,' gave great satisfaction.</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER XV.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE ORDINATION.</head> 
               <p>AT my return, I found that a new ministerial candidate had become domesticated at the parsonage. Mr. Kirkwood, a tall, dark young man, with<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6399-00000043"/> a lofty brow, and deep-set, thoughtful eyes, was the complete antipodes of flippant Parson Rodes,</p> 
               <p>Keeping aloof from the family, he rarely spoke, even at meals, excepting to discuss some mooted point of doctrine. Somewhat surprised with her stately ideas of lady-like hospitality, my aunt evaded these disquisitions as much as possible; but she was not, a woman to yield her convictions, or to subscribe to what she deemed unsound or heretical.</p> 
               <p>Notwithstanding her evident desire to avoid controversy, the new clergyman often contrived to draw her into long and animated conversations upon subjects in which they could not agree. The way the changes were rung upon original sin, total depravity, fore-ordination, election, free will, etc., would have rejoiced the heart of a polemical disputant.</p> 
               <p>Vainly striving to gain some light, I could but appreciate the power and skill with which my aunt managed her side of the argument, though Mr. Kirkwood was no mean antagonist; he must have felt himself not unfrequently foiled, if not wholly disarmed.</p> 
               <p>Peggy was terribly scandalized. "What did the young prig mean? Jest as though Madam wan't Scripter doctrinated! Little wonder the world was growing infidel with sich doctrines as these Hopkinshun idees laid afore the people. Teaching a body that they must be willing to be damned afore they could be saved! What sort of a Deity was the God they pictured up? Why, it was nothing short of blasphemy! Children ought to be taught love and reverence, from gratitude to their Heavenly Father, not from fear of the Devil. A family ought to be governed by affection, not by a birch pole behind the door."</p> 
               <p>Though the liberal party objected to Parson Kirkwood's settlement, as the popular voice declared in his favor, with true democratic grace they yielded to the will of the majority. So the call was given, and in due time accepted.</p> 
               <p>New Year's day having been appointed for the ordination, a general stir commenced throughout the parish; for an ordination at that period was one of the grand events of a lifetime,-the signal for great display of convivial hospitality.</p> 
               <p>As the old year waned to its last days, a second Thanksgiving baking began in every household; decanters and case bottles were replenished, glasses polished, and punch bowls made ready. As it was our province to entertain the Officiating clergymen and their delegates, we had a full share of this turmoil.</p> 
               <p>Peggy had been much scandalized at the choice the parish had made in a minister, and her part of these extra exertions was conducted in the worst grace. The new parson had most unwittingly healed a breach of several years' standing between the maiden and Master Neal; a doubtful fellowship was suddenly changed to the closest intimacy; but the way in which the new friends dissected the incoming candidate was positively frightful. In vain did Aunt Compton animadvert upon the duty of forbearance and charity. Her words were heard with respect, but it was evident that they fell on stony ground, perfect adamant. If Peggy's pride as cook had not been in question, I fear our guests would have fared but poorly. As it was, the good woman fretted and worked, worked and fretted, strode from pantry to moulding-board, from moulding-board to oven, slamming, doors, banging the rolling-pin, clattering dishes, and wielding the long oven shovel with a tremendous din.</p> 
               <p>"She wouldn't iron my white India muslin, not she. Wear that flimsy thing out nights this weather! No wonder the gals wan't as strong as their grandmarms. Miss Norton was a fool; folks would be tired enough with the day's works, without fiddle-dedeing all night."</p> 
               <p>I placed the irons before the fire in silence, and commenced to clear-starch a dress for a party Mrs. Norton proposed to give, ordination evening.</p> 
               <p>"What's them irons for?" demanded Miss Peggy, in her fiercest tone.</p> 
               <p>"To do up this gown, Peggy, dear."</p> 
               <p>"You ain't agoing to do it yourself, so you needn't think on't."</p> 
               <p>"No; but I will roll pies, while you iron it, Peggy, dear."</p> 
               <p>"Now, Jessie Bradshaw, I tell ye I wont stand none of yer gammon."</p> 
               <p>"No, indeed; I do not intend that you shall, Peggy, dear."</p> 
               <p>Facing about, with the rolling-pin in a threatening attitude, I was told to <emph>dear</emph> her again if I dared. "You are not going to roll pies nor beat cake; you will be killed with all this fracas; jest beating them eggs has put ye all in a hectic. We shall have ye with one foot in the grave next, going right after yer sir and marm; then what would Dwight say?"</p> 
               <p>"He wouldn't worry if I put in both feet."</p> 
               <p>"Now, Jessie Bradshaw, you say that agin if ye dare."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, I will take a Bible oath that his heart would crack into a thousand pieces if it will please you, Peggy, dear; but Dr. Norcross ordered housework, so give me the rolling-pin while you iron the dress; it is just ready. Mind and do it splendidly, Peggy, dear, because I intend to captivate all the young ministers, Peggy, dear."</p> 
               <p>With a make-believe box of the ear, Peggy declared I was the provokingest creetur, letting alone Dwight, she ever did see, and much mollified, surrendered the baking to my charge, and commenced to iron. Job, who was picking geese and chickens in the chimney-corner, began to anathematize matters now. Peggy was sufficiently quiet for him to be heard. "He'd ruther have pompous, little Mr. Rodes any day, if he did take a punkin lantern for the old boy. He didn't want a parson so starched up and sanctified that he couldn't say boo to a goose. This new man hadn't even the grace to be sweet on Miss Jessie,"</p> 
               <p>I assured my admiring servitor that that was a blessing for which I was devoutly thankful, adding that he "must strive to see Mr. Kirkwood's many estimable qualities."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Miss Jessie, ye can't catch old birds with chaff!"</p> 
               <p>"But, Job, you are not an old bird, so you must not think that I shall take you for an oracle."</p> 
               <p>Shaking his head, with a broad grin, Job bobbed his shock head, declaring 'twas u no use getting round a Bradshaw ; they'd allers an answer for everything."</p> 
               <p>He only wished Dwight was there. "Wouldn't he picter up Parson Grim?"</p> 
               <p>New Year's day dawned, cold and blustering. A fierce north-west wind drove the deep snow into such huge drifts that the teams were taken out to break a path to the meeting-house.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Kirkwood, with two other clergymen, had come the previous evening; at an early hour the other guests began to arrive. I was kept busy all the morning compounding flip, and hot brandy punch for the half-frozen people.</p> 
               <p>Aunt Compton had been troubled with rheumatism for several days; it was now found that she was much worse, though extra help had been employed. Polly Brown's rosy face was hailed with great delight.</p> 
               <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6399-00000044"/> 
               <p>"She could be spared at home; did we wish for a volunteer?"</p> 
               <p>Indeed we did; never was aid more opportune! At that moment, James drove to the door; springing from his sleigh, he hurried in, bearing a bright tin-kitchen in his hand.</p> 
               <p>This utensil was just coming in fashion. I had seen one in town; the rest crowded round my guardian with inquiring eyes.</p> 
               <p>In his most assured air, my cousin slipped off his overcoat, and kneeling before the new roaster, exhibited its merits; then springing to his feet, he cried, "Bring on your turkey, Peggy; I will help you spit it."</p> 
               <p>Peggy had been in a fume all the morning; this tin-kitchen was the drop too much. The vials of her wrath overflowed and poured over James' devoted head.</p> 
               <p>"Pooty times she'd come to, pooty times; she hadn't quite lost her mind, no, not quite, if a furren-travelled jackanapes did set himself up to show her how to roast with a new jing-lum-comflutter. She wasn't Goody Sloper, nor in league with any witchery, but an honest woman, that allers expected to cook as her marm did afore her, and if that wan'tgood enough, folks needn't eat her vittles; 'twouldn't more'n kill her if they didn't."</p> 
               <p>James, poor fellow, was tremendously taken aback. With the kindest motives, he had made this purchase, paid six or seven dollars for the utensil, purposely to help and please Peggy,-it really was too bad. Polly Brown's good nature overcame her prejudice, and in a most obliging manner she offered to roast the turkey, if Mr. Lee would show her how.</p> 
               <p>As Peggy declared the "heathenish varmint" should not be placed before the regular kitchen fire, the form was removed, and an extra one kindled in the usually unoccupied corner.</p> 
               <p>James turned back his cuffs, and proceeded to spit the turkey which Polly had stuffed; in half an hour my Mend declared herself au fait to the business.</p> 
               <p>It was now time for church. Aunt Compton could not go. I was obliged to be her representative. Fortified by her rich muff and tippet, and an extra-filled footstove, I escorted our lady friends up the hill. Although early, the house was nearly filled notwithstanding the bitter weather; many had come ten or fifteen miles, while there was a full attendance from our own and the adjacent towns.</p> 
               <p>The old building was like an icehouse; my furs and stove did not prevent a frequent shiver. The wind roared and whistled round the time-worn edifice, dashing the snow in frosty showers against the panes, which, as it was driven through the broad crevices of the rattling doors and windows, formed little drifts on the floor and sills.</p> 
               <p>Much to the consternation of the deacons, and the horror of the elder portion of the audience, the choir (which had been re-enforced by the best vocalist of the neighborhood) proceeded to sing an anthem in the modern style. Deacon Osborn had never favored Mr. Kirkwood's settlement; from that moment, he prophesied the most disastrous consequences from the connection.</p> 
               <p>Old Boreas whistled without; the consecrating services went forward within. The long sermon, followed by the ordaining prayer, charge, right hand of fellowship, and address to the people, with a closing anthem that quite outvied any former musical production that ever resounded through the old house of worship; then the benediction was pronounced, and the benumbed audience rushed towards home, warmth and good cheer. The clergymen crowded round the library fire, liberally helping themselves from the liquor case on the table. The ladies circled about that in the sitting-room with glasses of hot toddy.</p> 
               <p>The long table was already laid in the parlor, and the good success of Peggy's viands, coupled with Polly's wit, had won her into a much more propitious mood.</p> 
               <p>The turkey looked delicious. James took the dredging-box and assisted his coadjutor to baste the fowl. This done, much to the admiration of Peggy, my elegant cousin drew forth the skewers, and deposited the roast upon our best china platter. With a series of nods, she approvingly declared: "It was very well. She hoped somebody would now give cine credit to Jessie's discernment, and not set theirselves up to lord it over her likings! She strongly advised Jim Lee and Polly Brown to set up house together, if they could allers get on as well as they had over that tin kitchen."</p> 
               <p>Due justice having been given to the good cheer, the ladies retired. The great punch bowl, pipes and tobacco, having been placed before the gentlemen, they were left to the afternoon's conviviality.</p> 
               <p>As I had expressed a wish to see Aunt Sukey and Mira, both of whom were at South-end, James obligingly drove me thither. Uncle John's house and barn were full. Peggy had managed to keep her kitchen free of interlopers, but Aunt Nabby's was crowded with a rough set, who with jest and repartee, made free with the New England and eatables. Ruthy declared the master the wisest. "He had not permitted the least preparation, informing incomers that there was the fire; they could warm themselves, and that was all." Aunt Nabby rebuked her daughter: "We ought not to grudge when such an inspired man was settled over us. Why, Parson Kirkwood spoke as never man spake!"</p> 
               <p>Ruthy shrugged her shoulders, and commenced talking about the party.</p> 
               <p>Squire Norton's rooms were full in the evening. After a time, by dint of much manuvring, the long kitchen was at length sufficiently cleared for a dance; but the set had scarcely formed, when Mrs. Norton bustled in with the announcement that Parson Kirkwood disapproved of dancing; it must not proceed. Ann pouted, said the parson was engaged to be married, his opinions were nothing to her, and ordered the fiddler to strike up; but the rest had been reared in too much reverence for clerical authority to second the motion. With considerable ill-nature, they dispersed over the house, anathematizing the new minister as "a great fudge."</p> 
               <p>Ordination was followed by an entirely new regime. Instead of our winter sociables, prayer-meetings became fashionable. My aunt did not concur with these novelties. "Sunday preaching and the Thursday lecture had sufficed for our pious ancestors. She had no faith in these forcing systems." Like other young persons, I enjoyed novelty, and I grew curious and very anxious to join my acquaintance, but it was some weeks ere I obtained leave. At length, one evening I received permission to accompany Peggy to the school-house.</p> 
               <p>A huge fire roared in the great fireplace, and the room was imperfectly lighted by tallow candles thrust into perforated wooden blocks, which were scattered over the desks. The singers were practising a new tune as we entered. Deacon Foot, a short, pursy man, much overcome by his walk over the soft snow, followed us to a seat. After a second's pause, seeing what was going forward, he sprung to the teacher's desk. Gasping forth "That<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6399-00000045"/> is no way to praise the Lord," he jerked a hymn-book from his pocket, caught up a candle, and with breathless eagerness proceeded to deacon-out the two first lines of a hymn. The first was unintelligible, the second read, "And their types were all withdrawn," but in his breathless haste the old gentleman rendered it "And their <emph>tr-i-pes</emph> w-e-r-e a-11 w-ith-d-r-aw-n."</p> 
               <p>There was a universal titter; Mr. Kirkwood's entrance put a stop to the proceedings of his officious underling, and he humbly withdrew to an obscure corner, but my equanimity was completely upset for that evening. My aunt declared that I should not go to another meeting; I was bad enough already without being made worse by such disorderly assemblies; more than half went only for a frolic; it was shameful to call such mummery religion.</p> 
               <p>Aunt Nabby, on the contrary, was excessively anxious respecting the state of my soul. She and Ruthy did al they could to counteract Aunt Comp-ton's influence. Among them, I was in a fair way to hate the name of religion, and lived in constant dread of Parson Kirkwood's interference. Little intercourse had passed between us, but I now became aware that his stern, cold eye was often fixed upon me, and I was certain Aunt Nabby had commended me to his especial consideration.</p> 
               <p>The annual catechising in a neighboring district having arrived, I gladly embraced the opportunity to appropriate the library. This was my favorite apartment; here many happy hours had been spent, and much instruction gained. Having written a long letter to Dwight, I lingered beside the little table in the recess, where we had so often read and drawn. The winter sun shone brightly, the logs simmered on the hearth,-it was just the cosey solitude I loved. Leaning my head against the chimney, I fell into one of those dreamy reveries that are so delicious.</p> 
               <p>This was dispelled by the lifting of the latch. Mr. Kirk woo I entered.</p> 
               <p>"Don't go, Miss Bradshaw," said he, as I rose, "I have been seeking an opportunity to address you in private for several days; resume your seat if you please."</p> 
               <p>With a beating heart, I obeyed, but with a strong effort maintained self-control. I was aware that it was a part of the new minister's system to put everybody down. He sometimes displayed great tact in doing this; I had seen him set people, especially females, into such a fluster that they could not have told black from white. I was determined he should not obtain a victory over my free will. Therefore I braced every nerve, stilled every pulse, as far as I was able.</p> 
               <p>"Your aunt Nabby," the parson commenced, "has spoken to me frequently of late respecting your religious education and unregenerate state. She tells me what I cannot credit, that you have never been able to repeat the catechism perfectly."</p> 
               <p>"I had some difficulty in: retaining it in memory, when a mere child, though great pains was taken with my instruction, but as I have advanced in maturity this has been entirely obviated."</p> 
               <p>"I am happy to learn that Mrs. Lee was misinformed. I could not understand how the daughter of a race so renowned for steadfast piety had been thus neglected. Your position is enviable, Miss. Life must present an alluring aspect; do you ever contemplate, death and judgment?"</p> 
               <p>I replied that I often meditated upon my departure from this world.</p> 
               <p>"Indeed, and can you do so without dread?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, yes." This was strictly true. My interlocutor must have seen my perfect sincerity.</p> 
               <p>After a slight pause, he continued:</p> 
               <p>"You surprise me, Miss Jessie; upon what is this assurance founded?"</p> 
               <p>"The loving mercy of my Heavenly Father."</p> 
               <p>"And upon no merit of your own?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, no; all that I have is derived from Him, to Him be the praise and glory."</p> 
               <p>"What do you think would be your portion in another world?"</p> 
               <p>"That for which my soul is best fitted."</p> 
               <p>"Very well; supposing that the Divine will should assign you a place in the lowest abyss of the bottomless pit, could you still retain this affectionate reliance upon His wisdom and justice?"</p> 
               <p>"So long as I retain this love and trust, this yearning for the overshadowing of the Holy Spirit, I have no anxiety for my doom. Evil loves make devils and devils mate hell. So long as I keep my heart open to the reception of purity and truth, so long shall I become a recipient of good, and if I commence an angelic work here, it will be perfected hereafter."</p> 
               <p>"Beat that if ye can, ye ordained of the Lord! That is sounder doctrine than was ever stirred in any brimstone kettle," exclaimed a voice in the rear.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Kirkwood sprang aside, disclosing Goody Sloper, with the hood of her cloak thrown back, and a bunch of flaxen thread in her hand. Nodding her head at the minister, in one of her most sibyllic tones, she added, "If that was yer creed, parson, the divil and I couldn't spy out so many of yer secrets."</p> 
               <p>A dark frown had been gathering on the minister's brow. Now he thundered forth, "Begone, you limb of Satan! How dare you thrust your polluted presence into my private apartment?"</p> 
               <p>"Hoity, toity," she returned, indignantly. "Why don't you ask the Divine Lord how he dared to speak to naughty women, and to eat with publicans and sinners?"</p> 
               <p>Turning to me with a courtesy, she added: "I could not find your aunt or Peggy without, Miss Jessie." Excusing myself to Mr. Kirkwood, I followed the witch from the room. My aunt and Peggy were both emerging from the cellar as we entered the kitchen.</p> 
               <p>I expected Mr. Kirkwood would renew the conversation thus abruptly interrupted, but he never again referred to the subject. His leisure, soon became wholly devoted to preparations for his nuptials, which were to take place as soon as the house he was refitting on the Main road should be completed.</p>

               <head type="sub">BOSTON SIXTY YEARS SINCE.</head> 
               <p>JUST at dusk, one cold evening in February, James drove up, with the information that if I could be ready to return with him in an hour, I might accompany Aunt Sukey and himself to Boston on the morrow.</p> 
               <p>Go to Boston? Glorious! Up-stairs I rushed, followed by my aunt and Peggy.</p> 
               <p>The latter having been reminded that Mr. Lee was supperless, descended to minister to his comfort, while Aunt Compton drew forth my little red trunk.</p> 
               <p>"How long did James say you would stay?" she inquired, as she dusted it.</p> 
               <p>I had not stopped to ask, but now ran below with the inquiry.</p> 
               <p>"Two or three days."</p> 
               <p>These were short limits, but no matter! Peggy consolingly remarked<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6399-00000046"/> "That if I only got there, I shouldn't die a fool."</p> 
               <p>In half the time specified, my preparations were completed. My cousin hurried away, for we had a long, cold ride before us, and should be obliged to set forth early the next morning.</p> 
               <p>"I never thought of taking you with us till five minutes before I started, then it came into my mind what a nice opportunity it was to show you the city," said my cousin, as we drove away.</p> 
               <p>I thanked him warmly for his kind consideration, his constant endeavor to gratify my wishes. Anticipation kept me warm during the ride, and awake half the night. I was the first to be stirring in the morning.</p> 
               <p>Breakfast over, the stage was impatiently awaited.</p> 
               <p>At length the great sleigh, with its gaudy curtains and four white steeds loomed in sight and drew up before the door.</p> 
               <p>Aunt Sukey came down in her black satin cloak with its rich lace trimmings a new beaver bonnet, and wrought lace veil, and a superb set of rich sable furs. She looked very handsome, and Uncle Rutledge jocularly assured her, she would certainly make a conquest. With a contemptous toss of her dainty little head, which set the smooth, jetty curls into a fascinating flutter, my handsome old maid aunt replied: "She hoped she hadn't quite entered her second childhood" The trunks had been carried out, we followed with a merry laugh at Aunty Sukey's repartee. With a sigh of joyful satisfaction, I settled into my comfortable corner of the back seat, striving for a realizing sense of my situation, for it seemed altogether too much like a bright dream to be true. Yes, I was actually on my way to Boston. Several of our companions were acquaintances, and we had a most sociable ride. Then there was the bustle of changing horses, the taking up and setting down passengers, besides the novelty of the way, with a glimpse at the various towns and villages, and many a picturesque view of winter landscape. As we neared our destination, I kept a sharp lookout for foe first view of the city. About two o'clock it burst upon my admiring sight. How vast it seemed! What myriads upon myriads of buildings there appeared! Charlestown bridge passed, we entered the narrow, winding streets, lined by high buildings that shut out the clear, blue sky! What a novelty! My eyes stretched wider and wider as we threaded our way onward. The Boston of that period was far different from the Boston of to-day; but never has its most sumptuous modern streets presented the splendor that those narrow crooked thoroughfares that day exhibited, idealized, as they were, by my girlish enthusiasm. Often since, when retracing the route, I have vainly striven, to reproduce the youthful vision; to again glorify the dingy buildings and dirty pave, with the bright coruscations of an undimmed imagination.</p> 
               <p>Slowly making its way through the crowded streets, the stage at length deposited us at the "Bunch of Grapes," on State street. Safe at my destination, I found that I was both hungry and tired.</p> 
               <p>As Aunt Sukey was too much fatigued to go out that afternoon, I ensconced myself on the broad window seat, and found sufficient amusement in watching the opposite buildings and the busy street. Evening brought visitors. I did not retire till long after my usual hour; but the unwonted noises kept me awake some time. The sun had already risen, when I opened my eyes with the glad consciousness that this was to be my first day in Boston.</p> 
                
               <p>The morning was devoted to shopping. No Eastern bazaar of the "Arabian Nights" could have appeared more magnificent than those old-fashioned depositories. Completely dazzled, I much wondered how Aunt Sukey could so coolly select her purchases. The idea of bargaining and cheapening there-it seemed wholly preposterous. Our first calls were made in Cornhill, which at that time was the principal trading street, chiefly for dry goods, in the city. We made purchases at the stores of H. Tuckerman, whose establishment was famed for rich cloths; thence we proceeded to that of Fitch P. Putnam, who kept a large assortment of dry goods; next my aunt accompanied me to the book-store of Monroe, Francis &amp; Parker, which was at No. 4 Cornhill. Then we purchased some fancy kid slippers for evening wear, at the genteel shoe store of William Frobisher, No. 4 South Row. Near noon, James joined us, according to agreement, to escort us to the store of William King, 65 Ann street, where he assisted my aunt in selecting a handsome fox muff and tippet for myself.</p> 
               <p>At dinner, James declared his business over for that day, and inquired how we should like a ride to Cambridge.</p> 
               <p>Many thanks for the proposition, we should prefer it to anything. Besides getting a view of the colleges, we would call on parson or professor Noles, and Dwight would certainly feel slighted if we did not inform him of our presence in the city.</p> 
               <p>The Professor was delighted to see us, and Dwight for once was too happily surprised to be boisterous, and Turk was fairly beside himself.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Jessie! I cannot realize this," Dwight exclaimed, as we set forth together to view the University buildings, and the house Washington occupied before the evacuation of Boston by the British.</p> 
               <p>How fast we talked! After I had related all the news, told everything I could about everybody, I inquired respecting his pursuits. Well, he was getting on so-so. He did not love study, but had managed to keep a respectable standing in his class; but he had been taking lessons in miniature painting of an English lady. He got her to take his likeness for me, but as some of his friends were dissatisfied with it, be had painted another from it, which was thought preferable; I should see both and take my choice. This was the fulfilment of an old promise. The picture was presented in return for some half hundred sketches I had patiently submitted the young artist to make of myself.</p> 
               <p>After the painting of Ann Norton's portrait, I had personated all sorts of characters for him, attitudenized for hours for his especial benefit,-surely I deserved this reward.</p> 
               <p>My companion went to his room for the miniatures while I walked slowly forward towards the Professor's. He joined me immediately, and presented both the pictures. That of his own painting was much the best, and I instantly claimed it. The ivory was set in a pretty gold case, with a lock of the painter's sunny hair under the oval glass in the back.</p> 
               <p>James invited Dwight to return with us, and in half an hour we were on our way back to the city.</p> 
               <p>As the afternoon was not spent when we arrived, Aunt Sukey desired to make another call; James consequently set Dwight and me down in Cambridge street.</p> 
               <p>My companion wished to go to his Uncle Sprague's, and insisted that I should accompany him.</p> 
               <p>I inquired if we could not take King's Chapel in our route, as I was<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6399-00000047"/> desirous to see the church of which I had heard him speak so often.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, very easily."</p> 
               <p>Making our way over the slippery sidewalks, we approached the venerable pile, which was then one of the principal architectural ornaments of the city.</p> 
               <p>With awe I gazed at the massive, solemn fane, and expressed the desire I felt to see the interior.</p> 
               <p>Dwight said, he was sorry that I could not stay over Sunday, but that he hoped this brief visit was the prelude of a much longer one.</p> 
               <p>Proceeding onward, we crossed Washington into Summer street; walking down the left side, came to a large, old-fashioned house, before which Dwight stopped. "Is this your uncle's residence?" I exclaimed in some surprise, for I expected to have found one much more magnificent.</p> 
               <p>"Yes; isn't it handsome enough to meet your expectations? The girls want a new house, but my uncle talks of removing to his estate in the country soon, so will make no improvements here. This is a very valuable site, however, and that large field opposite is his property; his two cows are pastured there in the summer."</p> 
               <p>Entering, I was ushered into a parlor, where we found two tall, light-haired young ladies, whom Dwight introduced as his cousins. One, upon our entrance, had risen from a small, low, slender-legged piano. This was the first instrument of the kind I had ever seen. Miss Sprague informed me that her father had just imported it from London.</p> 
               <p>I begged her to play. She said she had not yet become much of a performer, but obligingly acquiesced.</p> 
               <p>I was charmed, and determined to ask James to procure one for me.</p> 
               <p>When we came out, I expressed surprise at the ladies' urbanity. From Dwight's and Miss Donaldson's description, I had anticipated a much more formal reception. "An heiress will never experience discourtesy from my wealth-worshipping cousins, though she be only a little country girl," Dwight laughingly rejoined. "You may count upon a very warm corner of their hearts, Jessie. They have really taken me into favor since they accidentally discovered that I had the honor of your correspondence," I playfully replied that I was happy to learn that somebody appreciated it properly. "But, seriously, Dwight, do you think I have nothing, independent of my fortune, to recommend me to people's regard?"</p> 
               <p>"Certainly, much; but that will always cast a certain prestige around you, that will be your best passports in some circles." I had already experienced the truth of this, and with a sigh, declared it was hard that I should never know how much I was esteemed, independently of my money.</p> 
               <p>"You can in some cases. Your Aunt Compton would love you just as well, Jessie, if you were without a sou, and I believe you may say the same of most of your other near relatives, and Polly Brown. You certainly have no cause to suspect your kind guardian's sincerity?"-"No, nor his love; but my heiress-ship renders me a much more important object in his eyes. He is fond of his ward, but her social position reflects upon himself, and ministers to his pride of place."</p> 
               <p>"What an analyzer of character you are, Jessie. I am actually afraid of you; I can't gainsay your words, but you cannot accuse me of any such ideas."</p> 
               <p>"No; I will give you the credit of being altogether too indifferent to pecuniary advantage. Thrown into seclusion, in lieu of better companionship, I became your friend and confidant, otherwise I dare say I should have been completely overlooked."</p> 
               <p>"You are slightly astray there, Miss Wisdom; I was not quite a hermit, and, of the two, Polly Brown is better company than you, more lively and entertaining I mean. She is just the one to drive dull care away; while you always put all sorts of serious thoughts into my head. So James has been brought to a toleration of the magnificent Polly? I doubt if he ever becomes capable of appreciating her properly. Stop-I must send her a token of remembrance-here is a jeweller's; shall I buy her a ring?"</p> 
               <p>"Polly would sing c Rings on her fingers, bells on her toes,' if you did," I laughingly rejoined.</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps she might, as she is always making fun of her hands. They are not very pretty certainly, though very useful, which is much the best, if they can't be both. What shall I buy for her?"</p> 
               <p>I suggested a silver thimble.</p> 
               <p>"That's it; how famously I should get on if I had my little Miss Wisdom always at my elbow, with her cool head-and hard heart."</p> 
               <p>I bade Dwight hush, to be on his good behavior and not defame me, as we entered the store of Davis &amp; Brown, 53 Marlboro', now Washington street. What a profusion of beautiful things! I had never dreamed there was such rich jewelry in America. After making some purchases for home friends, I ventured to treat myself to a pair of new ear-rings. Aunt Sukey and James had not returned when we arrived at our lodgings. After I had taken off my bonnet and pelisse, Dwight took a slight gold chain from his pocket; having drawn it through the ring of the miniature he threw it round my neck, saying, as he did so, "You must prize that chain, Jessie, for it was my mother's."</p> 
               <p>I told him I should duly appreciate the gift, but that I hardly thought I ought to take the chain. "You ought not to give your mother's jewelry away, Dwight."-"You do not suppose 1 would to any one but you, I trust?"</p> 
               <p>"No; but you ought not, even to me. None but a wife or child ought to wear this chain."</p> 
               <p>With a comical face, Dwight declared I was the greatest fudge-budge extant!</p> 
               <p>"Keep it, then, till I want it for that wife or child," he added; "it will be much safer in your hands than, mine."</p> 
               <p>I was willing to take it on those conditions, and the conversation was interrupted by the entrance of my relatives.</p> 
               <p>After tea, the theatre was proposed; Aunt Sukey was somewhat dubious respecting the propriety of the thing, but her objections were at length overruled, and half crazy with the delightful prospect, I ran to our room to prepare to look my prettiest, as James and Dwight directed.</p> 
               <p>The oil lamps before the old Federal-street theatre burned with their usual effulgence, but to my eyes they wore the brilliance of so many Aladdins, and in a whirl of excitement I mounted the stairs; but I had been seated some moments, in a front box of the dress circle, ere I could take a collected view of the scene.</p> 
               <p>With admiring wonder, I glanced timidly down to the pit, with its crowd of masculines, then, with more assurance, I surveyed the elegance and fashion upon my level; next, my eyes wandered to the less packed second tier, then still farther up, to those mysterious upper regions so near the lofty, ornamented roof.</p> 
               <p>The orchestra was playing upon our entrance. I had scarcely made myself familiar with the spectacle, when the curtain drew up, and "The Tale of<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6399-00000048"/> Mysteries" commenced; this was followed by the "Brazen Mask."</p> 
               <p>Although carried to the acme of felicity, unlike some play-goers I never for a moment gave myself up to the illusion. The scenery remained painted canvas; the actors, clever men and women.</p> 
               <p>Several gentlemen visited us during the performance. One, a handsome, middle-aged man, having requested an introduction to my aunt, devoted the remainder of the evening to her.</p> 
               <p>Was Uncle Rutledge to become a prophet?</p> 
               <p>James and I hoped so; Col. Selwin would be an unexceptionable match.</p> 
               <p>Dwight wondered we should be anxious to marry Aunt Sukey.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, a wedding would be a fine thing! What a time Uncle Rutledge would make of it! I must certainly be a bridesmaid."</p> 
               <p>The young man thought" We should scarcely be as gladsome as I supposed. Weddings usually were sober affairs."</p> 
               <p>As Dwight was obliged to return to Cambridge, he bade us good-night at the door of the inn; the Colonel also made his parting bow, but the next morning he paid a long call. I did my best at bantering my aunt, but was repaid with such a superfluity of my own coin that I was glad to desist.</p> 
               <p>At two o'clock, we bade adieu to the city; it was dark when we reached home. Mira and I loitered over the nursery fire in our night-dresses till a late hour, while I related the chief incidents of the journey. Aunt Sukey's beau was talked over with girlish glee, and a description was given of the theatricals, that elicited the applause of the youngsters, and called my aunts above stairs. Aunt Rutledge laughed till the tears ran, at the nonsense, while Aunt Sukey smartly remanded us to bed; her behests had been obeyed too long to be slighted, but Mira and I continued a whispered conversation till near morning.</p> 
               <p>Upon my return to the parsonage, I found Aunt Compton busy doing up her best cap, and Peggy up to her elbows, beating a huge milkpan-full of plum-cake.</p> 
               <p>What was going to happen?</p> 
               <p>"Why, Mr. Kirkwood would be married Thursday morning, and would bring his bride home that day; they would probably arrive about dusk, so the deacons and their wives, with several other leading church members, and all the young people, had decided to meet the happy pair on the confines of the parish, to escort them to their new residence, where the remainder of the congregation were to assemble to welcome the young madam. As they intended to spend the evening, the wealthier housekeepers had taken the tea-table under their supervision, intending to spread it with a profusion of choice delicacies."</p> 
               <p>Consequently, our Peggy's exertions. "She declared if that cake didn't put Miss Prime's all in the shadder she'd give up beat," as she deposited the pans in the oven. As Aunt Compton had never entered company since her husband's decease, I expressed surprise at her preparations. It was much against her inclinations, but Mr. Kirk-wood had requested her, as a particular favor, to receive his bride, and she felt it to be her duty to accede to his wishes. It was proper that she should do the honors of the occasion. "It will be the last time that this will ever be requested of me, Jessie," she added, smiling sadly. "I shall sink into the old dowager after this. Poor young bride, she little knows what she will be called to encounter; she shall have all the support my presence can give upon such a trying occasion." I do not know why it was, but I felt as if my aunt's sympathy was superfluous; that her presence would not be of much account to the woman that Mr. Kirkwood had chosen for a bride, or rather, that had accepted him for a husband. It seemed to me that she would have sufficient reliance on herself without a wish to lean upon any one, least of, all my stately relative.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE MINISTER'S BRIDAL.</head> 
               <p>AGAIN the parish were all astir. Every one being anxious to out-do their neighbors in dress, equipage and viands.</p> 
               <p>I could not see but what the new converts, notwithstanding their previous great show of renunciation, exhibited as much worldly-mindedness as the rest. It was for their favorite's bridal, however. Perhaps they thought the end justified the means. Ruthy came over, the afternoon of my return, to procure the Boston fashions. As she took leave, she whispered: "Don't tell everybody all this, Jessie; it is so unpleasant to be common, and if you are discreet, we can be the two greatest fashionables present."</p> 
               <p>I inquired if that was her creed, adding that she must not expect me to subscribe to it. I had no desire to become celebrated for fashion, but it gave me pleasure to be friendly and obliging.</p> 
               <p>With a disdainful toss of the head, my cousin replied, "that I could do as I pleased; but, for her part, she did like to be a little different from the common herd." Much amused with these airs, I promised the desired secrecy, a promise that became more difficult to keep than I had imagined. The whole parish actually besieged me for fashions; even Aunt Judy Neal came in to consult respecting her cap.</p> 
               <p>Monday evening, I was informed that Jonas Prime desired me to step to the door.</p> 
               <p>"Jonas Prime! Wouldn't he come in?"</p> 
               <p>"No; he wished me to come to the door."</p> 
               <p>Going into the hall, I perceived Jonas in an attitude of bashful awkwardness, on the steps to the back entrance. Advancing, I wished him good evening, and invited him to enter.</p> 
               <p>"No, I can't stop," he stammered, scratching his head. After a slight pause, reddening up to the roots of his white hair, he added: "I've come to invite ye to go with me to meet the parson Thursday night, and I hope ye will, Jessie."</p> 
               <p>It was difficult to command either face or voice, but I managed to politely decline: "I had not thought of joining the escort; if I did so, I should accompany my cousin James."</p> 
               <p>"Let Jim Lee look out for himself! He can get plenty of gals, and yer old enough, Jessie, to have a beau of yer own. I ain't none of yer Donaldsons nor Spragues; but sir's lots of chink, and that's what makes the mare go in this world, my dear. Sir and marm have scraped together more chink than ye guess, and I've had my eye on ye ever since ye was knee-high to a toad. If ye'll go, ye needn't worry but what I'll get a first-rate turn-out. Our colt is a teamer, and I'm gwine to borry cousin Zeke's sleigh. Jest say the word, and I'll engage to out-trot Peacock, or any other hoss. Won't folks stare? Then I've got a genewine broadcloth coat and a pair of silk breeches. Marm said she didn't care for the cost this time; Jessie Bradshaw's feller could afford to branch out a leetle. Now, do say ye'll go, ye sweet, pooty lady-bird, and I'll get some silk stockings and pumps, or do anything else that will please ye."</p> 
               <p>I had much ado to speak, but as concisely as possible, reiterated my previ<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6399-00000049"/> ous refusal. Jonas could not understand it, after all his splendid preparations. I really pitied the great, ungainly blockhead; but this commiseration vanished, as he at length turned away, muttering: "Darn it; I wish I had the money back for them clothes. Sir and marm were old fools to put me up to this. I might ha' knowed she'd turn up her nose at me." Completely overcome, sinking into the first seat, I gave full vent to the pent-up mirth.</p> 
               <p>Peggy, who had been listening at the kitchen-door, joined heartily in the laugh. "The beaux are coming in airnest, ye see, Jessie, spite of yer Aunt Compton," she said, wiping her eyes on the corner of her apron. "Dear suz, I'm e'en-jest dead. If that gumption had staid five minutes longer, he would have set me into fits. Broadcloth coat and silk stockings and breeches! Massy on us, I hope we shall live to see him wear'em! Dear, dear, I wish Dwight could jest step in for half an hour; this ere beats yer theatre plays all to nothing."</p> 
               <p>Aunt Compton was as much amused as Peggy. She advised me to apprise James of this invitation. My note received an immediate reply, in which I was assured that I should be defended from all Jonas Prime's allurements, and that the writer would out-do him in the splendor of his team, if he did not in that of dress.</p> 
               <p>Thursday morning, to the delight of the numerous watching eyes, dawned clear and bright.</p> 
               <p>The forenoon was spent at the new parsonage, where many of the ladies were actively engaged in preparations for approaching festivity.</p> 
               <p>After dinner, I assisted Aunt Compton to dress. In her black silk, snowy cap, 'kerchief and ruffles, she looked the perfect lady of the old school. I remarked that her manner was even more than usually quiet and dignified, and I knew by the pale cheek, compressed lips and drooping lids, that memory was unusually busy within.</p> 
               <p>Imprinting a quiet kiss of sympathy, which I saw was understood and appreciated, I went above to arrange my own toilet.</p> 
               <p>Peggy came in looking nicely spruce and old-maidish in her high-crowned cap, with its fine plaited frills and stiff cinnamon lutestring gown and skirt.</p> 
               <p>I told her she was altogether too grave for such a jolly time, and proceeded to garnish her with purple ribbons, at which she made a great face, "declaring I should make her more ridiculous than Jonas Prime, but then, one was always obliged to let me and Dwight have our own way; she never seed sich a pair; anybody might see the Lord had put us together."</p> 
               <p>At which asseveration, I raised such a quarrel that Peggy fairly stopped my breath with wonderful declarations on the elegance of the attire.</p> 
               <p>"Do stop talking, gal; no, Dwight is not half good enough for ye! Oh how splendid you do look in that pink and green changeable. La, sakes, why ye ought to have the governor! And them ear-rings! well I must say that puts on the touch. Du tell, are them the Boston ones? Oh you ought to have nothing less than the president! But gal what do you wear that picter for if you hate Dwight so?" she provokingly added, as I threw the chain over my head.</p> 
               <p>With a great pretence of anger at this impertinence, I hurried on my bonnet and wrapper, to join James and Mira, who were awaiting me below.</p> 
               <p>My guardian had procured a double sleigh, and a perfect match for Peacock, and rejoiced in the idea of outshining every one. It was just the sphere to excite his pride; one could not have taken greater pleasure in the display of that afternoon, where each did his best to outvie his neighbor, in horses and horsemanship.</p> 
               <p>Fifteen minutes brought us to the place of rendezvous. Here a gay scene burst upon the eye. Bright sleighs, prancing steeds, pealing bells and well dressed gentlemen, and ladies showy with silks, plumes and furs.</p> 
               <p>The house (the first in the parish) appeared thronged, but it was so cold James thought we had better try to gain an entrance.</p> 
               <p>Mira and I had just wedged our way through the crowd to a window by which Polly Brown was seated, when Jonas drove up his black colt and his cousin's sleigh. With a tremendous flourish, he swept to the door, and jumping out, displayed the full splendor of all his new toggery, even to the silk stockings and pumps. The unbuttoned overcoat, flying wide, exhibited the glossy broadcloth, dashy vest, and ruffled bosom.</p> 
               <p>Whom had he obtained to honor his fine clothes?</p> 
               <p>Bless us, was that Miss Norton? Yes, indeed; there she sat as elegant as her escort, bowing right and left like a queen. "Who would have dreamed that the exquisite school-ma'am would have condescended to this?"</p> 
               <p>"There's money, Jessie," whispered Polly, "besides, I do not believe any one else invited her, and Mr. Rodes is to be groomsman."</p> 
               <p>"Indeed; I did not know that."</p> 
               <p>At this moment, a shout of "here they come," uprose. Amidst hearty cheers, the bridal party advanced and stopped in the centre of the throng.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Kirkwood sprang out, for the nonce looking positively cheerful. The bride, a tall, robust girl, with a fair complexion and blue-eyes, dressed in a pearl-colored silk, with a white satin circular, trimmed with fur; a bonnet to match, and a, gray muff and tippet, smiled and bowed most graciously; but as she declined leaving the sleigh, Parson Kirkwood drove forward, followed by Mr. Rodes and Miss Kirkwood. The three deacons and their wives next advanced; these were followed by the more elderly portion of the congregation, the rear being brought up by the long line of young folks. The fleet steeds, merry bells, brilliant colors and dancing plumes, rendered it as lively a cortege as one could imagine.</p> 
               <p>My aunt received the bride with motherly tenderness; then with courtly grace, introduced her to the company.</p> 
               <p>It was a trying scene for the young madam, but, as I had foreseen, she was equal to the ordeal.</p> 
               <p>The more active housekeepers now began to think of tea. As I was crossing the hall, I encountered Mr Rodes. The little man seized my hand with most extravagant expressions of delight at the meeting.</p> 
               <p>Hastily withdrawing my hand, with an incoherent reply, I darted into the kitchen and ensconced myself under Peggy's protection.</p> 
               <p>The large tables fairly groaned under their weight of Delicacies, round which clustered the notable good wives, each anxious for the reputation of her viands.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Prime bustled about, with her flowered green damask gown pinned up, displaying the quilted pink tammy shirt, while she descanted upon the superiority of her pound cake. Aunt Judy, in her unexceptionable cap, nodded incredulously to Peggy, who, straight as a grenadier, sliced her" fruit mottled loaves with an air of defiant scorn.</p> 
               <p>I found that I had lost caste with the Primes. Debby flounced past without a word, bat her mother talked at me, "upon the sinfulness of being stuck up," much to the mystification of pretty<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6399-00000050"/> Mrs. Brown, to whom the speech was nominally addressed.</p> 
               <p>Tea having been handed and the dishes washed, my aunt and most of the married people took their leave. The more youthful ranged through the house, grouping as chance or inclination dictated.</p> 
               <p>The musically inclined, after a time, congregated in the parlor to sing hymns, under the direction of the choir-leader.</p> 
               <p>Ruthy sat by the bride, looking sweetly sanctified in her Boston fashions, which, as she had desired, elicited every one's admiration; but the old leaven peeped from her black eyes, as Miss Norton proceeded in a simpering flirtation with the clerical groomsman.</p> 
               <p>The beautiful Ann Norton languidly reclined in an arm-chair, scarcely deigning to notice the band of admirers by whom she was constantly surrounded, much to the chagrin of more active belles.</p> 
               <p>Jonas Prime strutted from room to room, all unconscious that he was the jest of the whole assembly.</p> 
               <p>Near nine o'clock, I descried Job beckoning to me from the entry. Hastening to him, I learned that Peggy had left two teaspoons: "I should find them in the pantry."</p> 
               <p>Several of the ladies had furnished plate,-quite a pile of spoons still lay upon the shelf; it was some moments before I discovered ours. Turning with them in my hand, a soft touch on the shoulder caused me to look up with a start.</p> 
               <p>"I beg pardon," exclaimed the low voice of Parson Bodes: "I did not intend to frighten you, my angel," he added, grasping my hand with an endeavor to convey it to his lips. Snatching it back, with an impatient jerk, the spoons were brought with a resounding whack directly across the parson's little, snub nose.</p> 
               <p>Without stopping to apologize, I made for the door, but the little man was too spry for me. Rubbing his nasal organ with one hand, with the other tie clapped down the latch, and, placing his back against it, eyed me much as a cat does an imprisoned mouse.</p> 
               <p>I was greatly provoked, and, in an angry tone, requested leave to pass.</p> 
               <p>"Not till you have sealed my doom, sweet Jessie; raise me to the height of bliss, or consign me to the depths of despair."</p> 
               <p>"This is perfectly preposterous," I gasped. "If there were not another man in the world, I would not even then give you the shadow of encouragement."</p> 
               <p>My suitor started aside with an indignant "Ah!" while I rushed forth like a whirlwind.</p> 
               <p>The company was breaking up. Running above, I astonished Polly and Mira with an outburst of the inner spirit, as I seized my wrappings. Hurrying them on, I bounded over the stairs, and in my haste to obtain the protection of the sleigh, came near forgetting to bid the bride good-night.</p> 
               <p>Her query of whether Madam Comp-ton's niece was not a rather eccentric Miss, which I heard asked as I turned away, did not excite surprise; I dare say the lady had sufficient reason for that impression. As I stept from the door, Parson Bodes' sleigh was led up. The minister having donned coat and hat, stationed himself at the foot of the staircase. Miss Norton came lightly down; there was a moment's whispered colloquy, then the lady presented her hand, and the parson daintily led her forth, directly past Jonas, and placed her in his own sleigh. Jonas stared, then in a perplexed tone, shouted: "You've mistook, Miss Norton, here I am; I durs'ent leave go the reins to wait on ye, the colt has got into sich a tantrum, with all the doings, but come right here and git in."</p> 
               <p>Miss Norton turned, and bowing graciously ciously, sweetly replied: "That Mr. Prime was very kind, but that she would return with her old friend, Parson Bodes."-"What does she say? Go with the parson; why, she's my gal! Look here, black coat, that's my gal; you've no right to her!" he screeched, as the parson took the reins, and with a low congee, swept up the road.</p> 
               <p>"Stop 'em, stop 'em! that's my gal," shrieked the discomfited rustic, red with rage, as he vainly strove to quiet the restive colt. "Stop'em, I say. Darn it, don't ye know that's my gal he's carrying off!"</p> 
               <p>There had been a breathless pause during the whole scene, but as the two vanished in the darkness, a shout that rent the air, went up from the crowd that were assembled about the door; a shout which, as the news was taken up and rehearsed, was echoed from within, while the whole company poured into the passage and before the entrance.</p> 
               <p>Jonas, stamping with rage, fiercely inquired, "Why somebody didn't stop'em? He didn't see nothing to laugh at, and somebody should laugh the wrong side of the mouth, if it wan't for that plaguy colt, and he'd have vengeance on that scoundrelly parson or his name wan't Jonas Prime,"</p> 
               <p>Parson Kirkwood, with ill-surpressed merriment, strove to mollify the indignant Jonas, as he assisted him to pacify the excited colt; at length the poor fellow, too, drove away, notwithstanding the parson's exertions, uttering curses both loud and deep.</p> 
               <p>Our ride to the parsonage was a merry one. Aunt Compton actually laughed, and Peggy fairly screamed over a recital of the evening's adventures.</p> 
               <p>Mira was to remain over night. Peggy had a bright fire for us in my room, and before we retired, we drew up the lightstand on the hearth, and endited a joint epistle to Dwight.</p> 
               <p>The following week brought a reply, with an enclosure of three clever caricatures. The first was entitled, "Jonas' First Attempt," the second, "Jonas in a Predicament," the third, "Love Passages in a Pantry."</p> 
               <p>Having been laughed over by a select few, they were laid aside, with other treasures of a like description.</p> 
               <p>Parson Bodes was careful to keep out of the way of the enraged Jonas, and in a short time it was whispered that Miss Norton did not intend to commence another term. Shortly after, the engagement was formally announced, the wedding day having been already fixed.</p> 
               <p>I was devoutly thankful, and, from the bottom of my heart, wished my former teacher unmixed bliss.</p> 
               <p>This spring, Aunt Nabby suddenly discovered that Ruthy was altogether superior to the daily routine of a farm life. She should no longer spin and weave, milk and churn. "If they only gave her a chance, she was as likely to marry a professional man as Madam Kirkwood!"</p> 
               <p>Accordingly, after much preparation of wardrobe, Miss Ruthy was despatched to Atkinson academy, to undergo a three months' polishing.</p> 
               <p>Colonel Selwin had visited Aunt Su-key several times since our memorable Boston tour, but nothing definite transpired till May, when our aunt announced that their marriage would take place in four weeks, immediately prior to a removal to Pittsburg.</p> 
               <p>This startling intelligence brought both dismay and grief. "Pittsburg! why, that was at the world's end!"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, it was a great distance, but Colonel Selwin's business could be advantageously pursued in that new and rising place; she was troubled at leaving her friends, but would be more troubled to separate from one who had won her heart."</p> 
               <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6399-00000051"/> 
               <p>Dear Aunt Sukey! Nothing could be said. Surely, she had lived single long enough, ministered to the various needs of the family sufficiently to please herself, and marry whom and when she would. But Colonel Selwin was already rich. Mira and I secretly pronounced him a heartless man, to carry a bride to such a wilderness,-what should we do without our' maiden aunt? Then to bury her thus in the far, far west, without a hope of an interchange of visits, it was terrible!</p> 
               <p>The wedding verified Dwight's prediction. Grandma'am and Aunt Rutledge wept through the ceremony Mira and I stood clasping each other's hand, feeling intensely solemn. Notwithstanding every effort, it was a rather April scene, tears mingling with smiles.</p> 
               <p>Scarcely hoping to meet again this side the grave, the final farewell was spoken, and the newly married pair commenced their arduous journey.</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE RAISING.</head> 
               <p>THAT spring Mr. Sprague began his long contemplated improvements on his farm in the Falls' parish. Preparations were made to convert the place into an elegant country seat. Raisings in those days were the signal for a festival. Extraordinary effort was to be made to mark the erection of the roof-tree of this princely mansion.</p> 
               <p>The doings at Sprague Farm had served for conversation through the summer; the raising put every one on the qui vive.</p> 
               <p>Our choir were invited to join that at the Falls in a consecration hymn; an address was to be delivered by Dr. Parkinson, the eloquent and distinguished pastor; this was to be followed by a sumptuous entertainment.</p> 
               <p>Dwight had come into the country during vacation. As his uncle was kept in the city by business most of the time, his nephew became a valuable coadjutor. His quick eye and good taste were brought to full account, and while he promoted his uncle's interest, he won golden opinions from those with whom he was associated, becoming a general favorite in the vicinity.</p> 
               <p>The Misses Sprague had been several weeks at Donaldson Place. They called at the parsonage with Miss Kate soon after their arrival, and it was arranged that I should accompany them to the raising.</p> 
               <p>At two o'clock on the appointed day, much to the admiration of Peggy and the sisters Neal, the green and gold coach drew up before the gate. The ladies leaned forth to greet me, and I was handed to a seat between Miss Kate and Miss Louisa Sprague, Miss Sprague and Madam Donaldson being our vis-a-vis.</p> 
               <p>The stout lady, in stiff paduasoy and immense turban, overshadowed the slight Miss Sprague in her scant, limp India muslin, casting her into complete insignificance. Madam was in the best of humors; her broad, red face grew radiant as she shook her fat sides at her own witty, but rather coarse jokes. The more refined Miss Kate kept up her usual stream of small talk, while the taciturn Misses Sprague leaned back in their respective corners, polite and reserved.</p> 
               <p>It appeared like a Sunday, as we drove forward; field and workshop were deserted, the wheel was silent, the shuttle at rest; the whole population had poured forth to be present at the grand raising. The factory at the Falls alone was in motion. Showers of spray, glittering in rainbow hues, poured over the huge water-wheels as they revolved in the snowy foam, and the buzz of the machinery mingled pleasantly with the rush of the miniature cataract over the mill-dam just above the picturesque bridge across which our road wound.</p> 
               <p>This, the first woolen mill ever erected in Massachusetts, had been in operation but a short time, and had not yet ceased to be an object of curiosity to the whole country side. As neither the Misses Sprague nor myself had visited it, Madam Donaldson ordered a halt.</p> 
               <p>The gentlemanly agent immediately came from his counting-room with an invitation to alight and examine the premises. Leading the way, he escorted us over the building.</p> 
               <p>The huge drums which carried the bands on the lower floor, coupled with the muffled buzz and hum of the machinery, were most impressive and novel, but our amazement increased upon reaching the second story. Here picking, carding, spinning and weaving were going forward. There were comparatively but few spindles, but at that time they seemed almost infinite. The looms, large, clumsy affairs, were worked by hand; weaving by water-power has been a later invention. The operatives were generally English emigrants, imported for this special work, and mostly males, a few young girls alone being employed in splicing rolls.</p> 
               <p>Having gone through the mill, thoroughly examined the whole, our polite escort handed us again to the carriage. Amid thanks on one side, and bows on the other, the coach moved on; Miss Kate declaring that she did wish that our Yankees had some manners.</p> 
               <p>"Where could you find an American of his class possessing the grace and polish of this English machinist? We are so democratic, so afraid of subservience and deference that, as a nation, we are really becoming vulgar and rude. Only a select few have the least idea that good breeding is worthy of cultivation."</p> 
               <p>Passing the parish church, towering amid its encircling graves, we drove down the hill; then, wheeling to the left, a lively scene suddenly burst upon our vision. Stretching up the road on the right, lay an old-fashioned, terraced, box-bordered garden, brilliant with gaily blooming parterres; beyond, stood the venerable homestead, gray with storm and shine of a century; in front swayed an immense throng, amongst which uprose the timbers of the new house.</p> 
               <p>Dwight came to hand us forth, but the ladies preferred to retain their seats. Mr. Sprague approached to pay his respects. He was followed by Dr Parkinson. Our host, a tall, stiff, formal man, almost immediately excused himself, but the little black doctor was extremely sociable. The eloquent divine was a devout worshipper of pretty women,-black eyes having his especial admiration.</p> 
               <p>Our brisk conversation was suddenly brought to a pause. The mammoth skeleton was erect, complete, ready for baptism. Statue-like upon the ridgepole, stood the master-builder, bottle in hand.</p> 
               <p>Gradually the tumult hushed, then every sound ceased. Amidst the most profound silence the libation (prime West India) was poured forth, then whirling the bottle three times about his head, it was tossed to the ground with an hurrah, which was caught up and reiterated with deafening shouts by the multitude.</p> 
               <p>Three times three having been given, preparations were made for the farther ceremonies. Boards were placed over a part of the floor-timbers, and the orator, singers, and most noted guests took their places.</p> 
               <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6399-00000052"/> 
               <p>As Madam Donaldson declined trusting her bulky person on the frail staging, Dwight placed her a chair upon the lawn; we younger ladies mounted a pile of timber a little beyond. The crowd closed in, and the hum of voices ceased. Dr Parkinson advanced, and in his usual eloquent manner, descanted some thirty minutes upon domestic architecture. Beginning with the rude huts of our progenitors, he came gradually down to the luxurious structures of modern days, and ended with an eulogistic peroration to the honor of the munificent founder of the present elegant structure. The singers next prepared to perform their part. It was a pleasant sight, those young girls in their white muslins and blue sashes, flanked by such a band of stalwart, handsome youths.</p> 
               <p>The tune was pitched; the united voices sang the first lines of the selected hymn: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l>"If God refuse the house to build,</l> 
                        <l>The workmen toil in vain-"</l> 
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>A tremendous crash!-down, down went choir, orator, and visitors, indiscriminately into the cellar beneath, amidst dust, rubbish and broken boards. It was a fearful sight! Frantic shrieks rent the air, the cries of the crowd mingled with the wails and groans of the wounded, while the throng rushed forward, trampling upon each other in their eagerness to assist the unfortunate sufferers; women fainted, children screamed,-there was the wildest tumult and confusion.</p> 
               <p>Polly Brown was among the singers; in an instant, I saw Dwight lift her from the ruins. I hastened to my friend, as she was placed upon, the ground. Her face was scratched, her body bruised, and her white muslin torn to tatters, but there was no serious hurt She was assisted to the house, where the rest of those injured soon assembled.</p> 
               <p>There were many bad scratches and contusions, but happily, no severe injury had occurred. The most serious happened to Joe Osborn, Ruthy's old lover, who received a severe sprain in his right shoulder. This mishap proved of great edification to his father, the Deacon. The young man had obstinately persisted in the practice of profane fiddling; this sprain, which disabled Joe for several months, was pointed out by his sire as a signal judgment upon his sinfulness.</p> 
               <p>The marks of the accident having been obliterated as far as possible, the entertainment was served; next came wrestling, running, and other athletic sports; it was dark ere the crowd dispersed, and it was long ere the famous raising ceased to be a topic of conversation.</p> 
               <p>Dwight passed the last week of his vacation at the master's; his presence was the signal for a party, which the old maids had long had in contemplation.</p> 
               <p>The master's room was made spruce, the kitchen cleared, and the best gowns brought into service. Invitations had been sent to all the young people in the neighborhood. A dozen girls assembled on the appointed day at two o'clock, and were received by the sisters with the utmost cordiality. Aunt Susy came from her bedroom, and it seemed as though each maiden had determined to out-talk her sisters.</p> 
               <p>The go-abroad knitting-works were examined, the desirability of cotton yarn in lieu of thread expatiated upon, and the variety of the ornamental clocks compared, and the different patterns explained. The beaux came to tea, the master joined the party, with a twinkle on his grim visage that all knew denoted a most genial, entertaining humor.</p> 
               <p>The entertainment was set forth in the kitchen, whither we were mar shalled by the master, who, as we had anticipated, became the soul of the lively meal. The banquet consisted of drop cakes, Indian doughnuts, election cake and whortleberry pie.</p> 
               <p>Aunt Judy had requested me to bring my guitar, which she declared "must be e'en-jest like David's harp." As most of the company were musical, we passed an agreeable evening.</p> 
               <p>It was a fine moonlight night, and as our hosts were bidden adieu at an early hour, the beaux and belles had a fine opportunity for sentiment. As Dwight and I sauntered up the hill, he suddenly asked, "What shall I choose for an occupation, Jessie?"</p> 
               <p>Haven't you decided yet?</p> 
               <p>No, and what is worse, see no reason that I ever shall."</p> 
               <p>"What do you say to law?"</p> 
               <p>"I have neither inclination nor talent for the profession. I should never rise to eminence, and a poor lawyer is a poor thing."</p> 
               <p>"True; what of medicine?"</p> 
               <p>"I have no taste for drawing teeth or dismembering limbs, or for dancing attendance upon fidgety fine ladies, cross old scapegraces, sentimental misses and squalling children."</p> 
               <p>"What a faculty you have for conjuring up bugbears," I laughingly rejoined. "There is but one other sphere open, the church."</p> 
               <p>A serious expression passed over my companion's face. Looking steadily into my eyes, he continued, "Don't laugh, Jessie; I have always had a slight bias towards the church."</p> 
               <p>I had suspected as much, but after a moment's reflection, replied, "That one ought to feel more than a slight bias to enter the ministry. Like Samuel of old, they ought to hear the Lord's voice calling them to the work."</p> 
               <p>"True, Miss Wisdom; and my inner voice calls me another way, but what can I do? Fate forbids my becoming an artist, and I could make myself a minister if I could get good enough, but I am so full of the old Adam!"</p> 
               <p>"But your interior self is serious and devout; I believe you possess the talents requisite for a popular preacher. We all ought to be good enough for ministers."</p> 
               <p>True, but I am the last person to undertake to reform others,-I, who cannot take care of myself."</p> 
               <p>"Still, I would cherish this idea of the ministry,-providence may make matters more clear to you."</p> 
               <p>"Providence works by human means, Jessie. My trouble is this human means. Painting is my good genius. Doing that miniature for you kept me out of a tremendous scrape, I will try to be studious and keep steady, get 'college learnt,' as Aunt Judy says, and hope for the best. The thought of this anxious, kindly little visage will be a strong incentive to exertion."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head> 
               <head type="sub">A SLIP BETWEEN THE CUP AND THE LIP.</head> 
               <p>THE three months' academy polishing over, Ruthy came home much more the lady, in her own and her mother's estimation.</p> 
               <p>Aunt Nabby declared that her pretty white hands should not be embrowned by milking and housework; that it now would be her own fault if she did not make a match that would set her above labor.</p> 
               <p>Accordingly, Miss Ruthy put on all her airs, turned a cold shoulder upon Joe Osborn, and tossed her head more than ever.</p> 
               <p>A division had arisen in the parish respecting baptism. It had been the<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6399-00000053"/> practice of the former pastors to christen every child presented for that rite.</p> 
               <p>Parson Kirkwood determined to set aside this "half-way covenant" (as it was termed), and receive only the children of church members</p> 
               <p>This was the signal for great commotion, as it had been understood, previous to his settlement, that the clergyman would admit the "half-way covenant," and he was accused of deceit and double dealing.</p> 
               <p>My aunt strove to convince the parson of his error. u Jesus had called little children to him, and blessed them. Were these John's or Peter's children? No, but infants taken indiscriminately from the crowd; probably from the arms of mothers wholly unacquainted with the great teacher, to whose presence curiosity alone had brought them."</p> 
               <p>Mr. Kirkwood courteously admitted the truth of my aunt's argument, but notwithstanding, went steadily forward in establishing his favorite method of church discipline.</p> 
               <p>The effect was to dissatisfy a large number of his best parishioners; several left the congregation; amongst these were Peggy and the master.</p> 
               <p>Naturally, the opposition looked up to Aunt Compton as their leader, and though the good woman strove to encourage friendly and charitable relations, there was little sympathy between the two parsonages.</p> 
               <p>The inmates at South-end, on the contrary, had become great favorites of the new pastor and his lady; this intimacy was increased by the visit of a brother of Madam Kirkwood. This gentleman, a lawyer of some distinction, a grave, silent person, with a singularly triste and absent air, immediately became an object of great interest to Aunt Nabby, and she determined that he should become the matrimonial ladder by which Ruthy should climb to indolent fine ladyism.</p> 
               <p>Madam Kirkwood seconded these views, and heartily cooperated in every manuvre to further the object; fop Miss Ruth Lee was a desirable match, in a pecuniary view, besides personally being everything desirable.</p> 
               <p>There were sociable tea drinkings, and more formal evening parties at both mansions, rides and walks,-every device that could facilitate the growth of an intimacy between the young couple.</p> 
               <p>Though polite and attentive, for a time the gentleman was strangely insensible to Miss Ruthy's charms, but, like most beleaguered citadels, he at length succumbed, and the engagement was triumphantly announced.</p> 
               <p>My experience in love matters was as yet not extensive, but it struck me that Mr. Lovett was singularly cold and reserved, and my sentiments were shared by the family in general, but Aunt Nabby would not listen to a hint upon the subject.</p> 
               <p>"He sot a deal by Ruthy, a deal; he was too much of a gentleman to court a gal like our country nobodies, but he sot a deal by her, and why shouldn't he? They would be married in six weeks; it was short notice, but she should'nt be ashamed of her darter's fixing out, nor of her wedding nuther,"</p> 
               <p>Great became the commotion; Aunt Rutledge's house was literally turned topsy-turvey to accommodate Miss Ruthy's mantua-makers and seamstresses.</p> 
               <p>James had accepted an invitation to be groomsman, and as Aunt Nabby was fully alive to the honor of being a near relative to the great heiress, I was appointed bridesmaid.</p> 
               <p>My skill in marking had been called in such constant requisition, that, as a consequence, I rose on the eventful tenth of December with a severe nervous headache.</p> 
               <p>Concealing it as well as I was able, I went over to South-end, where I knew that my services were expected It was late in the afternoon before I was at liberty to return. The family exclaimed at my ghastly visage, and it was found that the dress of dead white silk which I was to wear to match the bride's was terribly unbecoming.</p> 
               <p>In vain Aunt Compton fortified me with green tea, arranging and rearranging the rich lace trimmings, striving for a better effect. In vain did Polly Brown twist and retwist the glossy, black ringlets, bringing them farther forward, then pushing them back. It was no use, the more they exerted themselves the paler I grew. Peggy declared "I looked like a speerit, with that white face and them great! sorry eyes; she'd run up gerret and git some mullen leaves, they'd give me a beautiful color if I'd hold them to my cheeks a minute. She'd done it many a time when a gal."</p> 
               <p>Affrightedly disclaiming such blistering cosmetics, I went below. James threw down the paper in his hand, and pronouncing bed my only fitting place, gave vent to his feelings in a few genteel anathemas at Madam Kirkwood's and Aunt Nabby's expense.</p> 
               <p>South-end was a blaze of light when we arrived. Most of the guests had assembled; James and I were ushered to the bedroom where Ruthy and Mr. Lovett awaited us.</p> 
               <p>The bride looked very lovely. What was unbecoming to my sallower complexion was especially suited to her blooming beauty.</p> 
               <p>The noise of carriages ceased,-the clock struck seven! Ruthy nervously patted her satin-slippered foot upon the floor; I drew on my gloves.</p> 
               <p>At that moment, the swift gallop of a horse broke the stillness, the next, the door opened: "A letter for Mr. Lovett," said Molly Finn, with a courtesy.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Lovett took the missive and advanced to the light upon the mantle. As he glanced at the superscription, his face flushed, then grew deadly pale. Turning his back to us, the letter was read in silence. After a perusal and reperusal, he turned, and commenced pacing up and down the room. Ruthy ventured to go to him, and with her gloved hand upon his arm, inquired. "If he had received bad news?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes,-no-" was gasped in such a sepulchral tone that I unconsciously turned to James, whose eyes met mine with a perplexed expression.</p> 
               <p>"What are you about? didn't you hear the clock strike?" exclaimed Mira, skipping in. "Everybody is waiting, the parson up in the middle of the floor, the doors are all open; everybody is expecting your appearance."</p> 
               <p>James rose, Ruthy took a fluttering look in the glass, I lifted my aching head from the side of the bed, and took my guardian's arm,-still, the bridegroom paced to and fro, with that mysterious, agonized expression on his ghastly face.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Lovett," there was a good deal of command in the groomsman's voice, your <emph>bride,</emph>-we <emph>all</emph> await you."</p> 
               <p>Then came a breathless pause; Mr. Lovett stopped in the middle of the room. Passing his hand, with a bewildered look, across his brow, he stepped before Ruthy and essayed to speak, but in vain. Thrice the effort was made ere speech followed, then, in a husky whisper, he murmured: I cannot marry you, Miss Lee-for reasons I cannot now explain, this marriage must not take place,-it would be sacrilege. I must leave you without a hope of pardon. My conduct has been wrong,-wholly inexcusable, but I hope to explain some day, even to claim the friendship which I shall always entertain toward you and yours."</p> 
               <p>With a slight bow, the gentleman<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6399-00000054"/> wheeled about, and hastily approached the door; James' hand arrested, him. With the exclamation of "For God's sake, don't interfere!" he shook himself loose and darted past.</p> 
               <p>Not a sound had interrupted this singular scene; now Mira ran out screaming for her mother and Aunt Nabby; Ruthy, whiter than I had been, sank into a chair, while I bent over her with hot cheeks. Between our incoherence and their surprise, it was some moments ere we could make the matter comprehensible to Aunt Nabby and Aunt Rutledge. When the truth really became clear, Aunt Nabby fell into violent hysterics, and Aunt Rutledge sent for Parson Kirkwood and his wife.</p> 
               <p>Their surprise and consternation equaled our own. Mr. Kirkwood and James went in search of the false swain, but he had taken the farmer's horse and made good his retreat.</p> 
               <p>Uncle John was summoned, and a council held respecting the next step. What could be said to the assembled guests? At length it was decided that James should inform them that, Mr. Lovett had received an unexpected letter, which was of such importance that the nuptials had been postponed. It was some time before the house was cleared of the wonder-struck throng; not till then were we at liberty to go up stairs. Ruthy had sat in an apathetic state during the commotion, now whispering me to accompany her, she ran to her chamber.</p> 
               <p>"Lock the door, Jessie," she gasped, "don't let mother or the rest come, but do help me to get off these things, I can't breathe, they are stifling me, have a great mind to throw all this silk and lace on the fire," she hissed between her set teeth, as she wrenched herself loose from her bridal robes.</p> 
               <p>"No, no," I interposed, really frightened at my cousin's violence; but I was glad to see that the color was returning to cheek and lip, glad to hear the passionate tones and hysterical sobs that followed. After a time, the family were permitted to enter, when the affair was duly discussed; but everything still remained shrouded in mystery. Not the least clew could be discovered for Mr. Lovett's conduct.</p> 
               <p>At a late hour, a good dose of hop tea having been administered to the disappointed bride, she was prevailed upon to seek her couch. I took my old place beside her. How life had changed since I had last occupied that spot! I turned to expatiate upon the theme to my bed-fellow, but, lo and behold! she was fast locked in the arms of Morpheus. Concluding that her heart was not quite broken, and that she would survive the shock, I strove to compose my thrilling nerves, but that was impossible; not one wink of sleep visited my eyes on that never-to-be-forgotten night.</p> 
               <p>Great was the gossip as the strange event spread abroad; all sorts of stories were set afloat, but explanations were not received for several days. Meantime, Ruthy kept her chamber, refusing to see any one out of the family. Madam Kirkwood was also greatly distressed at her brother's inexplicable conduct.</p> 
               <p>Letters at last came, letters to both Ruthy and the Kirkwoods.</p> 
               <p>Two years previous, Mr. Lovett had formed the acquaintance of a young lady, a pupil at the, academy in his place of residence. This acquaintance ripened into love, and mutual troth was plighted. After the girl's return to her home, a constant correspondence was maintained for some months; then it suddenly ceased; his letters remained unanswered, and the lover received the astounding intelligence, from what he deemed a reliable source, that the false, fair one was about to give her hand to another.</p> 
               <p>Disappointed, indignant, grieved Mr. Lovett determined to forget his love, and to facilitate this, came into the country to visit his sister. In this state, he met Ruthy. Her evident partiality pleased his vanity; her beauty and position suited his taste and ambition; his sister urged the match, and in an unlucky hour he proposed and was accepted. But, day by day, he grew more ill at ease; an inward voice urged him not to utter vows which his heart refused to ratify, but a sense of honor withheld retraction. With a bosom torn by these conflicting feelings, he was approaching the altar when that letter arrived, the superscription of which, at a glance, told him that it was from the hand of her he loved. That epistle disclosed a scheme of villany unparalleled out of a romance.</p> 
               <p>The lady's family, desirous of her union with a more wealthy suitor, had suppressed the letters to her lover, and spread the report that she would soon marry his rival. Providentially, she discovered the ruse in time to prevent a miserable union, for such it must have proved to Ruthy, as well as to Mr. Lovett, if his first fiance's missive had come too late.</p> 
               <p>On the day, a few weeks later, appointed for the bridal of Mr. Lovett, I was summoned to South-end "Come this afternoon, and wear your best bonnet and wrapper," ran Ruthy's note.</p> 
               <p>Somewhat surprised at the message, I went as directed. Aunt Nabby bade me go to Ruthy's room as I entered.</p> 
               <p>What was my astonishment to find my cousin standing before the glass in the full glory of her white silk, while mine (which I had not taken home) was carefully laid out on the bed.</p> 
               <p>Stopping in the doorway, with dilated eyes, in wondering tones, I demanded what this all meant?</p> 
               <p>"That this is to be my wadding day as well as Mr. Lovett's, my dear," my cousin triumphantly returned. "Did you suppose I would submit to be left in the lurch to become an old maid?"</p> 
               <p>"Who in the world is going to take you?" I unceremoniously blurted forth.</p> 
               <p>"Guess, Miss Impertinence. Don't you know? haven't you heard a lisp?"</p> 
               <p>"Not a sound; but have you and Joe Osborn really made up?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, <emph>we</emph> have really made up I How big your eyes are my dear! But they are very beautiful! You will look vastly better to-day than when you had that dreadful headache. But you will have to descend to William Norton for a partner as James is in Boston. Come sit down, I will smooth your curls!</p> 
               <p>So you didn't know it? Isn't it capital! I was so glad the town clerk lived in the old town parish!"</p> 
               <p>"But how did you bring it about, and how does the deacon feel pleased?"</p> 
               <p>"Deacon Osborn? Oh, he is delighted! Everything has been at sixes and sevens since the old lady died, and he knows I am a good Housewife."</p> 
               <p>"Why, I thought you did not mean to work any more."</p> 
               <p>"Just hush! Sit still, or these curling tongs will burn you. Now, behave, and I will tell the whole story,-it is as good as a novel."</p> 
               <p>I was coming from Parson Kirk-wood's the day Mr. Lovett's letters were received, when whom should I meet but Goody Sloper. I tried to pass without speaking, but she planted herself directly in front of me, exclaiming, 'That's right, keep a stiff upper lip, and put a bold face on the matter! Trust to me, and you shall be married on the same day as your false squire.'</p> 
               <p>"Too preoccupied to pay much heed to her talk, I hurried home. Madam Kirkwood took tea with us; after she had left, I sat down by the fire in the<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6399-00000055"/> fore room, to think over past events; then the Goody's words came forcibly to mind. What did she mean?</p> 
               <p>"Just then there was a knock at the front door, I mechanically rose and opened it. What was my astonishment at being confronted by Joseph Osborn.</p> 
               <p>"My heart beat so I could not speak, but Joe came in smiling, cordially wishing me good evening.</p> 
               <p>"what did it mean?</p> 
               <p>"Joseph, seeing my consternation, stopped, and hesitatingly inquired, 'if I had not expected him. Goody Sloper had informed him that I was exceedingly anxious for an interview.'</p> 
               <p>"'Goody Sloper,' I gasped; 'what a witch she must be thus to divine my secret thoughts!'</p> 
               <p>"'Then you did not send for me?'-"'I should not have dared,' I murmured, hiding my face in my hands.</p> 
               <p>"Joe drew me down beside him, and we had a long, long talk; one that I shall remember and profit by to my dying day. There I had been despising him because he was only a plain, honest farmer; setting myself above one whom I was really vastly beneath; but I mean to become worthy of him, and also to become a true Christian woman, instead of the vain, silly hypocrite of the past few months."</p> 
               <p>"What did your father and mother say to the new programme?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, mother was only too glad to many me up, and hush scandal. Father was thankful I had come to my senses; he hoped he should never hear any more nonsense about style, position and fashion, but that I should do my duty in the sphere it pleased God to place me.</p> 
               <p>"Joe said the Goody had served us such a good turn, it was no more than fair to verify her prophecy; as I was ready, we concluded to be married today, but I determined to keep the whole thing secret if possible. I did not send the invitations for the wedding party till this morning."</p> 
               <p>Are you to have a reception this evening?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, certainly, You wouldn't have all that cake mould? Yes, we are to have all the guests that were present the other time; but concluded to be married this afternoon privately, for to own the truth, I was a little nervous about it. I couldn't have waited the assembling of the company in that bedroom again. You would have seen me flying up the chimney! There, you look sweetly; I am sure Dwight would pronounce you the divine Miss Wisdom immediately."</p> 
               <p>I laughingly assured my cousin that it mattered little so long as he was not present. I should not think she would have the cruelty to remind me of his absence on such an occasion.</p> 
               <p>Ruthy peered questioningly into my eyes. "You don't love him, or you are the best hider of secrets I ever knew?"</p> 
               <p>"Which of the two opinions do you conclude upon, ma'am? But here are the sleighs; I think you had better attend to your own affairs at present," I merrily returned, as I assisted my cousin to arrange her silver gray cardinal and white satin bonnet. Aunt Nabby had two foot-stoves ready filled; the coverlets were tucked warmly about us, and, with a fervent blessing from her parents, Ruthy and her lover drove forward; William Norton and I followed. Dr. Parkinson and his family were awaiting us, and the nuptial knot was soon tied.</p> 
               <p>South-end was full of relatives at our return. Uncle Rutledge's family, Miss Betty Bradshaw, and other town friends; James was expected later.</p> 
               <p>The bride's greeting would have warmed the heart of a cynic. Uncle Rutledge was in one of his funniest moods, and old Deacon Osborn grew actually boyish. Aunt Nabby was obliged to both coax and scold to bring the company into sufficient order for tea.</p> 
               <p>This was scarcely handed round, before the evening visitors commenced to arrive. Mirth and enjoyment were universal, when the sound of bells rose above the din of voices; Uncle Jerry, seizing the horn lantern, rushed forth joyously, shouting "that Major Lee had come!"</p> 
               <p>Uncle Jerry had divined truly; there was Major Lee, but who was that figure in the rear?</p> 
               <p>"Dwight, Dwight, here is Dwight Sprague! welcome, welcome!" uprose a chorus of voices. This was indeed a most pleasant surprise.</p> 
               <p>After the young men had offered their congratulations to the bridal pair, and become warmed and refreshed, the merriment increased.</p> 
               <p>Dwight declaring that I looked like a bride, called for Parson Kirkwood. Half a dozen voices responded that he was too late, the parson had returned home.</p> 
               <p>"Besides, Dwight, Jessie declares she will never have you," wickedly interposed Polly Brown.</p> 
               <p>Heigh, ho, hunt. She's strong I Dreadful icy! Isn't she Jonas?" the wild fellow continued, wheeling round to where that individual stood in all the radiance of his new freedom suit. "Flint, adamant, rock crystal, a whole mammoth care stalagmite. Let's commit suicide, Jonas, pierce our hearts with a skewer, and die weltering in gore at the feet of the iceberg."</p> 
               <p>Such a shout, it was really too bad! For Mr. Prime and his sister's sake, I hastened to hush Dwight, who next demanded a fiddle.</p> 
               <p>Parson Kirkwood had vetoed dancing, so the bridegroom had not brought his violin.</p> 
               <p>Much to everyone's surprise, Deacon Osborn at this moment appeared, making his own way through the crowd, with the instrument in his hand. Giving it to his son he bade him strike up.</p> 
               <p>"Solomon had said there was a time to dance, and this was one of the times intended; we should not presume to set our knowledge above that given us in the word of God. Dance, then', my children! dance, and make merry; let your hearts be glad, and your faces shine; dance, and give thanks, praise and rejoice!"</p> 
               <p>Greatly impressed, the set formed with a chastened alacrity. Spite of Parson Kirkwood, the dancing was kept up till nearly midnight. Dwight inspirited the old as well as the young; before the evening was over he had set half the old folks to tripping the "light fantastic toe." Those who had not danced for years, became brisk as the youngest. Everybody declared they had renewed their age; While Grand-ma'am affirmed "that nothing could equal Ruthy's two weddings, they were more curious than any romance"; and Deacon Osborn asserted "that she reminded him of Job, her last day was her best day."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XX.</head> 
               <head type="sub">BOARDING SCHOOL.</head> 
               <p>THROUGH the exertions of some of the leading men in the Falls parish, a seminary for young ladies was established there the ensuing Spring.</p> 
               <p>This school was hailed with delight by both Aunt Compton and myself, as it presented the advantage of an academic course, with the convenience of spending the Sabbath at home.</p> 
               <p>The school opened the first of April, under the most favorable auspices. There were from forty to fifty pupils,<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6399-00000056"/> among whom were my Cousin Mira, Ann Norton, and several other intimate acquaintances, besides young ladies from various parts of New England.</p> 
               <p>The establishment was under the care of two ladies of marked ability, and the course, of instruction much superior to any I had hitherto enjoyed. I now entered upon a regular course of grammar, geography, history, rhetoric and arithmetic,-"Walsh's" arithmetic having been substituted for "Pike's."</p> 
               <p>As I had become imbued with Master Neal's strong love of Latin, I was sorry to relinquish the study; expressing this regret to Dr. Parkinson, he very kindly offered to attend to my recitations, which thenceforward became a delightful recreation, closely cementing a warm friendship between myself and the distinguished divine.</p> 
               <p>To keep us staid and proper, out of the mischief incidental to boarding schools, Mira and I had been placed under the supervision of Miss Hastings, the principal teacher. We boarded with her and several of the other pupils at a widow's, near the seminary.</p> 
               <p>This old lady, an excessively pious and parsimonious person, favored us with long prayers and homilies, and extremely short commons.</p> 
               <p>Her lynx eyes would wander up and down her meagrely spread board, evidently begrudging every mouthful. A good appetite, or the gratifying it, was in her eyes the one unpardonable sin.</p> 
               <p>"Prayer and fasting, Miss Hastings, and young ladies," she would whine in doleful accent with lengthed visage; "Prayer and fasting are the two great weapons for carnal warfare. This is a terrible world, a terrible world, the sooner we depart the better, if we can reckon ourselves among the called. Mortify the flesh, my friends, and thereby purge the spirit; that is the only way to fight the good fight, and become heirs of the white robe and the golden crown."</p> 
               <p>The girls slyly concluded that if the present was the old lady's regenerated heart, her natural one must have been abominably wicked; and they were so sinful as to query her adaptation for the heavenly spheres, as it was not supposed that she could there find scope for her penurious habits and miserly propensities. If several of the young ladies had not lived near, and thus were enabled to victual the whole, we could not have survived till the end of the term; but this parsimonious regime was the; cause of some most ludicrous scenes.</p> 
               <p>Miss Hastings had established the custom of reciting texts of Scripture before the morning and after the evening meal. Our hostess always made it a point to listen to the exercise, which she did with the most sanctified air and expression.</p> 
               <p>One evening, we had been served with some light, fresh rolls,-a great rarity on the widow's table, as every saving housekeeper knows that old bread goes much farther than new. The meal ended, Miss Hastings made the signal for the Bible lesson to commence. The first in turn, was a wild girl from New Hampshire. Rolling up her eyes and drawing down her chin, in a distressingly supplicatory tone, she exclaimed, "Evermore give us this bread." The effect was irresistible I The widow scowled. Miss Hastings bit her lip, and we girls suppressed our laughter and continued the recitation as we were able. It was rather an unintelligible affair, but no reprimand was received.</p> 
               <p>This was such an open expression of public opinion, that our landlady was forced to give it some heed, but towards the end Of the term the old regime was resumed.</p> 
               <p>One Thursday night, our private stock of provisions having given out, after a scant supper, and an evening of hard study, sleep was declared impossible, and a proposal to besiege "Old Skinflint's" larder was unanimously hailed with applause.</p> 
               <p>Tiptoeing down the stairs in our night dresses, we boldly opened the kitchen door, but a peep into the large, sparsely-furnished room, silent in the moonlight, brought a strange awe over the party, and no one durst venture beyond the threshold.</p> 
               <p>Suddenly, Ann Norton, who was one of the foremost, with a suppressed shriek, sprang back, nearly oversetting those in the rear.</p> 
               <p>"Don't go in," she whispered, with livid lips, "there is something white moving about in the pantry,"</p> 
               <p>"Pho, Ann, what a scarecrow you are!" valiantly returned the New Hampshire heroine.</p> 
               <p>"Hush," said Mira, in a suppressed tone. "Ann is right, there is something white,-a tall figure all white, standing by the dresser."</p> 
               <p>"You goose," returned our leader, "it is a towel, or something, hanging upon the wall!" Turning to me, she added, "Come, Jessie, you have some pluck, come with me,-you know you want to see a ghost."</p> 
               <p>Taking my hand, with a quick, firm step, she crossed to the half-closed pantry door.</p> 
               <p>I must own to a queer sensation as I followed my companion over that sanded floor, a sensation that I think may be akin to that of a soldier, as he rushes forward in a "forlorn hope" to storm a bastion. Nature recoiled, but pride and courage urged an advance; then I could not shrink where others dared. One foot from the mysterious closet, I rushed before my schoolmate, and seizing the door, swung it wide open. A tall figure, white from head to foot, towered in the centre of the small apartment.</p> 
               <p>For an instant, we stood transfixed, then the spell was broken by a low laugh, and the musical voice of Miss Hastings congratulated us upon our valor.</p> 
               <p>Yes, it was Miss Hastings, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en robe de nuit,</foreign> driven like ourselves, to seek for refreshment, but not one morsel could be found. Hunger, however, became forgotten, as the ludricrousness of the whole adventure grew apparent. Amid mirth and fun, teacher and pupils resought their pillows.</p> 
               <p>The new mansion at Sprague farm was not completed till July, and the family did not remove thither till the commencement of Dwight's vacation.</p> 
               <p>Mira and I were immediately honored with a call from the young ladies; this was followed by an invitation to tea from theft mother.</p> 
               <p>On the day designated, Dwight came for us in his uncle's rich, but plain carriage; we were received and shown over the house and grounds with much urbanity by his cousins.</p> 
               <p>Business detained Mr. Sprague most of the time in Boston, and Madam Sprague, a victim to gout, rarely left her room, but Dwight whispered, as we returned from the garden, that I must prepare for the dignity of a personal inspection.</p> 
               <p>Quailing from the prospective distinction, I was hoping, as the afternoon waned, to escape from it, when the sound of several steps and the tap of a cane struck my ears. Dwight sprang forward and deferentially held aside the door, while Miss Lucretia hastily wheeled a large, easy chair to the window next the entrance. It was scarcely placed, when the van of the approaching procession, a small, black boy bearing a footstool, arrived; he was<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6399-00000057"/> followed by a white girl, loaded with cushions and pillows; then came a short, stout, florid woman, in a ruffled dimity wrapper and gauze cap, leaning upon the footman on one side, on the other supported by a gold-headed cane; the rear of the cortege was closed by the housekeeper, a magnificent personage, equipped with a shawl, smelling bottle, fan, and a bouquet of pinks.</p> 
               <p>The ceremony of introduction having been performed, after much bustle and arranging and re-arranging, the invalid at length became seated; but it was discovered that the wind was east; her chair must be removed to a south window. Dwight presented his arm, and after another ten minutes' fuss and flurry, Madam was finally placed to her mind and at leisure to attend to her guests.</p> 
               <p>"I am happy to see you, young ladies," she graciously exclaimed, with a graceful bend, which was coupled with a quick glance of scrutiny. "How much you resemble your father, Miss Rutledge; and this is the divine Jessie," she continued, turning to me with much affability. "I have long been familiar with your lineaments, my dear, from the contents of a portfolio that was carelessly left upon the drawing-room table." Perceiving my rising color, the lady hastened to add, "Do not be distressed, my dear; I kept the discovery entirely to myself and gave such a caution to my nephew that I am certain the sketches have since been kept from the profanation of general sight."</p> 
               <p>"My extreme youth must be my excuse for permitting Mr. Dwight to retain those drawings, and you may be assured my Aunt Compton knew nothing of them," I hurriedly replied, adding, as I turned to Dwight, "I must insist upon their being- immediately returned or destroyed."</p> 
               <p>"Your behests are always obeyed, Miss Bradshaw; they shall be immolated at the funeral urn of the defunct little Jessie," replied that gentleman, with a low bow.</p> 
               <p>"You quite misunderstood me, my dear young lady," interposed Madam Sprague. "I never dreamed of imputing the slightest indiscretion on your part. The sketches have much merit, and you were very kind to encourage our young amateur so much. It must have been exceedingly wearisome. Now, that my nephew has relinquished the wild idea of becoming an. artist, I am happy to accord his talent full justice; but I hope you will permit him to retain these boyish productions, as I am certain that he cherishes them fondly."</p> 
               <p>Here the artist nephew made as great a face as Peggy, for which he must have accounted had we been alone; as it was, I was obliged to content myself with a look, which plainly inquired, What did that mean, sir? In return, I was told, sotto voce, "Not to look so like a tigress, though it was vastly becoming." Madam Sprague next turned to congratulate Mira respecting the elegant mansion her father was erecting in town.</p> 
               <p>Miss Sprague said, "That he came to look at her piano the week before they left the city, intending to procure one like it," while her mother added, "And he concluded to send to Paris for furniture similar to this, though I advised him to get red damask, instead of green, for a town drawing-room."</p> 
               <p>I glanced at the handsome sofa and chairs, the marble-topped tables, huge mirrors, rich carpet and curtains, and told Mira, that her mother would preach economy more than ever.</p> 
               <p>"Is Mrs. Rutledge very economical?" inquired Miss Lucretia.</p> 
               <p>"Papa and Jessie think so. She has been anticipating reverses ever since I can remember. They have not yet come, and I have become used to ma's prognostications of evil," replied Mira.</p> 
               <p>"Still," said Miss Sprague, "it behooves us to think of the possibility of change; many people have been sadly reduced since the troubles in Europe began,"</p> 
               <p>"I am not sure but that Jessie would enjoy poverty and a hut," Mira laughingly returned. "She often talks as though her fortune was a great curse."</p> 
               <p>"It would relieve her from that phantom fortune-hunter that haunts her waking thoughts and nightly dreams," said Dwight. "If the lucre was gone, you could fearlessly confide in Providence and me, couldn't you Jessie?" he saucily inquired.</p> 
               <p>With a contemptuous air, I repeated, "Confide in you! I hope I should have a better support, if it was needed."</p> 
               <p>"Wait till the time comes, Jessie," was whispered in return, in such a thrilling tone that, with a shudder, the words fell upon me like a prophecy. Sobered, almost saddened, I turned away, to hide my involuntary emotion</p> 
               <p>Madam Sprague, though unable to catch the whisper, witnessed its effect, and hastened to gaily interpose a hope that her nephew might not reverse the matter and claim my august protection.</p> 
               <p>Mira declared if misfortune came, that she should teach school. To which Dwight gallantly replied, "That he should wish to be a little boy again, to sit at her feet for instruction."</p> 
               <p>"You should sit on a stool in the corner, and receive a sound whipping often as you deserve," returned his pretty interlocutor, with a pursed-up, school ma'amish air.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, dear, how these girls abuse you," exclaimed Madam Sprague.</p> 
               <p>"I guess my teaching will go with your preaching, Dwight," continued Mira.</p> 
               <p>"Preaching!" exclaimed all the Spragues in a breath.</p> 
               <p>"Dwight preaching! well, that is something new!" added his aunt.</p> 
               <p>"Didn't you know that he intends to become a second St. Augustine, after he has sown a sufficient quantity of wild oats?" Mira mischievously inquired.</p> 
               <p>"No, indeed, I never heard of it before! Dwight enter the ministry? why, it is preposterous!"</p> 
               <p>"Say nothing about it, then," gravely returned her nephew.</p> 
               <p>"Upon second thoughts, I am not so sure," resumed Madam Sprague. "If you will renounce those dissenting doctrines inculcated by your mother, and take regular orders, I think it would be an excellent plan. A clergyman always has a certain prestige, and old Dr. Callender is getting feeble, I dare say we could get you appointed his colleague; then in due time you would be advanced to the rectorship, and that would be a sure stepping-stone to the bishopric. I advise you to consider the plan, my dear boy."</p> 
               <p>"I shall become a Methodist preacher if I enter the ministry," the dear boy demurely replied.</p> 
               <p>I came near laughing, but the Spragues gave a general scream, and with much disgust, exclaimed "Horrible! don't mention such low people, Dwight"</p> 
               <p>"I shall study with Uncle Sam," pursued the incorrigible nephew.</p> 
               <p>"Uncle Sam! who in the name of wonder is he?" inquired his aunt in amazement.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, a relative of mine by the way of marriage," provokingly returned the scapegrace.</p> 
               <p>Mira went off in a merry titter, and the Spragues turned to me for an explanation. I assured them their relative was not worth noticing; his nonsense really did not merit expounding.<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6399-00000058"/> Tea at this moment having been announced, Dwight offered his arm to his aunt, the former procession was formed and the old lady safely conveyed to the table.</p> 
               <p>The evening passed agreeably, with music and conversation. Towards its close, while the others were grouped about the piano, Madam Sprague called me to a seat by her side, and began to talk about her nephew.</p> 
               <p>I saw that she was anxious to discover how high he ranked in my esteem, but I was discreet, and besides, I highly relished the mystification of the lady.</p> 
               <p>"Dwight is a sad fellow," she exclaimed, with a furtive glance at me, "an unsettled, wilful boy, but he has a kind heart, Miss Bradshaw. His mother spoiled him, that is the root of the trouble,-she just ruined him. It was a happy day for us all when Providence saw fit to remove her."</p> 
               <p>"Why, I thought she was the very salt of the earth,-little below the angels!" I cried, in surprise.</p> 
               <p>"So she contrived to make herself considered. If it had been a Catholic, country, I believe the community would have sainted her. Father Sprague almost worshipped her; I was nothing in comparison. Of course, it was really too small a matter to fret one, yet I must acknowledge that it was annoying to have daughter Kitty quoted right and left, and set up as a pattern woman Even Dr. Callender pointed her out as a model Christian, although he knew she was not evangelical."</p> 
               <p>"Did she not belong to King's chapel?"</p> 
               <p>"Stone chapel, we call it, since the Revolution, my dear. Yes, she belonged there, but that I am sorry to say is no longer an evangelical society. They have departed from the faith, and become worse than infidels. Why, my love, they have had the audacity to alter the prayer-book. I am not strenuous in my opinions; never have objected to Mr. Sprague's attending meeting, while I, a Virginian, reared in episcopacy, go to church; but the Stone chapel medley I cannot abide."</p> 
               <p>The carriage at that moment being announced, the conversation was abruptly brought to an end. With a cordial invitation to renew the visit, to come sociably, any time, our adieus were made. Dwight gaily asserted" I had won the old lady's heart, he was certain. I should be chief maid of honor to her highness," while Mira declared "She was jealous! That she thought her beauty ought to be equivalent to my money." I laughed and chatted during the short ride, but at heart I was sad, and ill at ease. What was truth? For a longtime I lay awake that night pondering the question.</p> 
               <p>There were Aunt Compton, Mr. Kirk-wood and Madam Sprague, each of a different creed, and while they were fully assured of the infallibility of their several doctrines, they were quite as sure of the fallacy of that held by others, while the three joined in execrating and scorning Uncle Sam, who, in turn, was just as sure of his own exemption from error.</p> 
               <p>I could not but think that these differences and dissensions, these bickerings and heart-burnings, must seem exceedingly trivial in the eye of the Universal Father. Did not they worship one Deity, trust in one Lord? Why such rancor and disagreement?</p> 
               <p>Despairing of unravelling this knotty point, I had recourse to Dr. Parkinson at the next Latin lesson.</p> 
               <p>With one of his funny squints, he gravely informed me, "That I must not doubt Madam Sprague's orthodoxy, for she had given that parish a Bible and its pastor a surplice."</p> 
               <p>Seeing my puzzled look, he became serious: "My dear young lady, you ask me what is truth, and where it. is to be found? <emph>Here!</emph>" laying his hand on the large Bible by his side. "Here it is! Here you can find it Read and ponder. Look not to man, but to God, and the truth will come; not the formulas of man, but the divine truth. Forms are good, are necessary, but always remember, little lady, that it is the Holy Spirit alone that giveth life, Where that is, there is <emph>Truth</emph>."</p> 
               <p>About six weeks after Dwight's return to the university, near the end of the afternoon session, I received a message from Madam Sprague, summoning me in haste to the Farm. This notice would not have excited unusual surprise) as since the absence of her daughters on a tour to Saratoga, I had often been honored with similar communications, had not it informed me that something unforeseen and distressing had occurred to Dwight.</p> 
               <p>The suspense was not to be borne. Begging a dismissal, I hurried to the Farm.</p> 
               <p>Madam Sprague, who had been watching my approach, received me with tears, crying "Oh, that wretched boy. I believe he was born to be our bane, Jessie."</p> 
               <p>Sinking into a seat, I faintly asked what he had done?</p> 
               <p>"Read. Here is a letter for you; 1 suppose he has made the same confession to you, that he has to his uncle, only probably in a different manner."</p> 
               <p>Seizing the missive she held out, I retreated to the farthest recess, and drawing the window drapery about me, so as to secure comparative solitude, I broke the seal.</p> 
               <p>"You must set me down a very long, broad black mark, Jessie, dear," it commenced, "but don't quite erase me from your books. I have been an exceedingly naughty boy! Picture me standing penitentially before you, with a finger in my mouth, and a tear in my eye, declaring that I am sorry, and that I won't do so any more!</p> 
               <p>"As I am certain that my gracious Miss Wisdom cannot withstand such an affecting appeal, I will hold up my head, and tell my story like a man.</p> 
               <p>"All these months of college life I have been careful to keep free of scrapes. One way and another, you have helped me wonderfully in this, Jessie, and art has also been my good genius; painting that miniature for you kept me out of a frolic that would have proved anything but elevating. But to my story. Last Thursday, some of the fellows caught a goat that has been a nuisance round the green, and proceeded to array him in an old military coat, a white wig and a cocked hat. As bad luck would have it, I was drawn to the scene of action, and as the old fellow did not relish his new finery, my assistance was invoked in tying on his head-gear. Never dreaming that any trick was in contemplation, I thoughtlessly complied.</p> 
               <p>"The bell, at that instant, summoned us to prayers, and I hurried away. I had no sooner gained a seat, when what should I espy but Billy, standing in the entrance to the broad aisle. I had not the slightest idea of introducing the goat into the chapel, but it seems that was the intention of the originators of the mischief.</p> 
               <p>"I was about to rise, and drive out the animal, when Billy jumped upon the rail heading the pews on the right side, and nimbly made his way the whole length, thence, he leaped to the communion-table: with another bound, the pulpit was reached; planting himself directly upon the cushion before the officiating professor, Billy gave a sonorous bray. Nothing could have been more ludicrous or mirth-provoking. After a time, the goat was driven from the building, and the service proceeded; but the aggrieved faculty took<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6399-00000059"/> the matter up, and all who had any hand in the business have been suspended six months. According to my destiny, I must suffer with the more guilty.</p> 
               <p>"Well, it can't be helped, but I meant to have graduated with honor, had you and the family on to commencement. Now, I shall not return; I am not sure that I ought to have entered college, but I trust that the time has not been wholly misspent. I shall not seek a profession.</p> 
               <p>"High-ho, what a weary way I make of life! But it is of no use to imitate Lot's wife. Go ahead, is my motto. The future has always been terribly misty; I never could see more than an inch before my nose, and I hardly discern that now. Uncle Sprague's head-clerk is ill, and I am supplying his place; I can have the situation if I choose, but my uncle and I do not agree in our ideas. I will not barter my sense of right for all the gold of Golconda.</p> 
               <p>"Write me a good, long letter of sage advice, my Mentor, and inclose a thick lock of your bonnie black hair also; an acquaintance has offered to plait me a watch chain, arid your long, even locks, are just the requisite material; besides, I need it for a talisman. You are my sheet-anchor, Jessie; don't cast me adrift, or I shall certainly be swept upon the rocks of perdition.</p> 
               <p>"My head aches dreadfully, and my heart worse. How I wish that I could throw myself at your feet, in our recess of the dear, old library; your cool hand would be so refreshing to my fevered brow. But a truce to this. I must, and will, be strong and brave Tell the girls I send them all a hundred kisses apiece, and ask Polly Brown not to despise me: I will send her my Virgil when Cousin Lucretia comes What a girl Polly is! I admire her more and and more every year.</p> 
               <p>"Write if possible, by return of post to your affectionate, if wayward Dwight."</p> 
               <p>With a sigh of relief, I refolded the letter. This was bad enough, but nothing to what my alarm had conjured up. There was nothing criminal, still it was provoking. I also had held reveries respecting honors and commencement. It was a shame for a young man, nearly twenty, to make such a boy of himself. I had no patience with his folly! But he is paying a fearful penalty for his thoughtlessness; he suffers more than you can imagine,-whispered pity.</p> 
               <p>Suffer? well he ought to suffer, out-spoke the sterner nature. What right has he to cause his friends such trouble? why was it that my life should be mixed with this youth's? It should be so no longer. His weal or woe should not affect me! Could this be? No, never! Try as I might the cords could now never be severed. Oceans might roll between us; Years of separation might intervene, still our souls must remain united. In taste, thought and feeling, we had become one in youth-one must we remain till old age.</p> 
               <p>With a strange awe, I recognized this unity,-I must accept my fate! Never could we now become wholly sundered, neither in this world nor in the world to come. As this truth forced itself upon me, I buried my face in my hands, and with anguish of spirit questioned why we had ever met! The next moment brought rebuke. Had not the companionship conferred more than it had received? Was I not infinitely indebted to Dwight? From no other source could I have received such refining culture. No; much more than schools or books had he ministered to my mind's development. I felt how comparatively ignorant, how bounded and meagre my ideas would have been had I never known him. No; I could not repine, or wish my life other than it had been. I would take the bitter with the sweet; perfection was not to be looked for in this world. It was a subject for thankfulness, that the young man had no bad habits surely; this high-souled son of genius would some time emerge into the clear and perfect day. Does genius ever find its place? whispered anxiety. Oh, dear, what was I to do? What advice ought I to give?</p> 
               <p>While these thoughts had been passing through my mind, Madam Sprague, seeing me deposit the epistle in my pocket, had commenced a soft, piteous plaint. "Isn't it a shame," she began. "Such a foolish, childish affair, and I had set my heart on the silly boy's taking orders. The Sunday after that conversation in August, I requested him to read the service, and I can affirm he did it clue justice, and that is more than can be always said. He read it splendidly, Jessie, with such a reverent tone and air that it was perfectly divine. I am sure that in a surplice he would look heavenly. I was reminded, while he read, of a painting of St. John I once saw in Philadelphia. I am certain he would create a great sensation, if he would only persevere and study for the ministry; he might pursue his course with Master Neal or Dr. Parkinson through the six months; but Mr. Sprague says he will not hear of a return to college. What shall you advise, Jessie? Of course you will remain his friend?" This last query was put in an anxious tone.</p> 
               <p>"If possible," I replied; "but I cannot take it upon myself to advise any young man." Drawing my shawl around me, I was about to depart, but Madam Sprague would not permit it. I must stay to tea. In vain I pleaded my Latin lesson. I should ride; she would order the meal directly.</p> 
               <p>Feeling that opposition was useless, I submitted with as good grace as possible, but talk I could not. At last, the supper was over, and I seated myself in the chaise with my hostess' incessant plaint ringing in my ears. Dear Madam's petted footman felt called upon to commiserate me, as we drove forward. "Master Dwight was a good 'un, though; the best of the bunch! Young fellers would have their goes. Lord love ye, Miss Jessie, this is nothing to what Mr. Paul (that is his uncle) used to do when he was his age! Pious as he is now, he was a rare one at Mr. Dwight's age! Lord's sake, the old granther could tell ye if he was alive!"</p> 
               <p>Half crazed with this gossip, I was thankful to find myself in my room. Mira and I had secured board at the parsonage that term; our chamber was shared by two other young ladies; quiet was not to be obtained there. My bonnet was scarcely off before the summons came to the library. The Latin lesson was recited, how I cannot say; the rest of the evening was at my disposal; but where could I writ?</p> 
               <p>After a moment's reflection, I gained courage to ask the loan of a corner of the Doctor's table.</p> 
               <p>"Certainly, certainly, now, and at any time, Miss Jessie; but what has happened, my girl? what has that heedless boy Dwight done?"</p> 
               <p>I inquired why he suspected that he had done anything unusual?</p> 
               <p>"Mira said Madam Sprague had sent for you to come to the Farm, and she supposed something was amiss with Dwight."</p> 
               <p>I knew that the tale would soon reach every ear, so related it to my kind friend.</p> 
               <p>"The good-for-nothing jackanapes, to get into such a scrape! But, after all, it is nothing. The blackguard will do well enough by-and-by. He will make a man yet; so don't worry your little pate about him."</p> 
               <p>I replied that I did not intend to do so.</p> 
               <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6399-00000060"/> 
               <p>"That is right, little lady; 'don't compromise yourself; you are very young, and those eyes could secure a Duke, if we had such gentry, which thank God, we have not. But be prudent, my little heiress; do not throw yourself away, or marry in haste to repent at leisure."</p> 
               <p>I assured the Doctor that he might rely upon my discretion, as for marrying; I intended to become a second Miss Betty Bradshaw.</p> 
               <p>Pulling my curls, the good gentleman hoped I should be half as good a woman; but he also hoped it would not be as a single one, and left the room, after a comical message to Dwight, half reprimand, half encouragement, declaring that it was his clerical duty to go and comfort Madam Sprague.</p> 
               <p>At last I was alone. Half an hour I lingered over the small fire, which the autumn night rendered grateful; then seating myself in the Doctor's chair, in a few words, I expressed my regret to Dwight; while assuring him of my interest and sympathy, I emphatically asserted that its continuance rested entirely with himself. His future, as far as human means was concerned, rested wholly in his own hands. Now was a turning point; he could make it either weal or woe, and I solemnly implored him to look beyond me to the only true source for consolation and guidance.</p> 
               <p>Enclosing the hair as desired, sealed the missive and joined my companions. The news was already known, through Dr. Parkinson. Mira declared "She was glad it had happened! Dwight never was designed for a profession; art was the mistress to which he now should devote himself body and soul."</p> 
               <p>The next week brought a serio-comic reply to my missive. The first sentence was a passionate outburst, of the inner spirit, coupled with fervent longings for the good and true; the next, informed me that I need fear nothing for his future, as Dwight Sprague, Esq., was a candidate for the highest honors.</p> 
               <p>"I entertain very serious thoughts, Jessie," he wrote. "Very serious, and intend to become converted. Not from the error of my ways, as I do not see as that would prove a profitable speculation. Saints do not flourish now-a-days, but what is incontrovertibly of much more importance, I think of swapping my political creed. Here goes: down with Federalism, hurra for Democracy! Don't shudder Jessie, though Federalism is the most fashionable in your parts; there are really quite a number of respectable, genteel Democrats in the country, and I think of applying for the Commodoreship of Jefferson's gun boats, or of scaring up another expedition after 'Horned Frogs' and 'Prairie Dogs,' with Lewis and Clark."</p> 
               <p>Though I could not refrain from laughing, I was far from satisfied with the epistle. But when did Dwight perfectly satisfy me? Never, for any length of time, certainly. His political burlesque was so apt, however, that I could not resist reading it to Dr. Parkinson.</p> 
               <p>Jefferson's boat flotilla, as well as the recent expedition of Lewis and Clark, to the Columbia river, was exciting the derision of the Federal party, who, of course, seized every pretext for annoying their opponents.</p> 
               <p>The trouble and losses experienced by our maritime and commercial population had increased the bitterness of party spirit in our borders to a pitch that was little short of frenzy. Politics became the chief theme in every circle; in the city and country, on the Sabbath and on week days, in the mercantile mart and by the household hearth, at weddings and at funerals. Like the religion of Christ, they divided vided people and kindred, and a man's foes became those of his own household.</p> 
               <p>Congregations were divided; clergymen became active partisans, and thundered from the sacred desk their anathemas with anything but Christian forbearance, and their hearers acted what the ministers preached.</p> 
               <p>Society became divided into two great cliques; there were Federal churches and Democratic churches; Federal balls and Democratic balls; such a set would not speak to another set because they were of opposite parties; neighbors did not associate for the same reason. Friendships grew cold; matches were broken, and all the bonds of society changed.</p> 
               <p>The Democrats of our vicinity would rush to town on a Sunday to listen to the Democratic Parson Jenkins, while many of the opposite would come six miles, in the heat and dust, or cold and snow, to luxuriate in the rushing eloquence of that famous Federalist divine, the Rev. Dr. Parkinson, who weekly poured forth from his high pulpit the Alpha and Omega, with as much of the "thus saith the Lord" spirit as ever Moses dictated from. Sinai.</p> 
               <p>At Thanksgiving, I found that Polly Brown was preparing to join the seminary. An aunt; had offered to furnish lodging, but as her residence was more than a mile from the school, James, much to my surprise, suggested that I should pay Polly's board at Dr. Parkinson's.</p> 
               <p>"Thanks! the proposition gives me much pleasure. I had thought of it, but dared not mention it."-"Am I such an ogre, pet?" he gaily inquired, as he rose and bent over me, tenderly adding: "In future, I hope all your wishes will be confided to one who is certainly desirous of gratifying them."</p> 
               <p>"But I was not sure that you would approve of Polly's attending school."</p> 
               <p>"If she was satisfied with her attainments, I think it would be as well, but as she is not, it is no more than just to smooth her path up the hill of science."</p> 
               <p>Again thanking my guardian, I ran over to acquaint Polly with the pleasing intelligence, but, much to my chagrin, the offer was kindly but firmly refused.</p> 
               <p>"You are very kind, Jessie, and it was very considerate in Mr. Lee to think of the proposal, but he taught me the value of self-reliance long ago. The walk is nothing; it will do me good."</p> 
               <p>In a pet, I replied that she would be indebted to her aunt.</p> 
               <p>"No; I can do enough out of school hours to pay for my keep"</p> 
               <p>"Not and study as we do; we study very hard."</p> 
               <p>"You already know how expansive are my capabilities," Polly returned, with a laugh.</p> 
               <p>But I was ill pleased, and gloomily asserted that I was not loved as formerly</p> 
               <p>My dear, darling Jessie, time will show; but really I cannot accept your kindness, or Mr. Lee's, without pain,-a loss of independence which I could not endure. Perhaps I am too proud, but Mr. Lee <emph>shall understand</emph> me, if I am not fully appreciated."</p> 
               <p>Startled, almost frightened, at the unusual vehemence manifested by my friend, I looked up and gazed into her face. In what was it changed? I could not define! "How pretty you are growing, Polly," I exclaimed.</p> 
               <p>Pshaw, Jessie, don't be foolish! I shall never be pretty."</p> 
               <p>"No, pretty is not the right word; superb is better; regal beauty, crowning queenly grace."</p> 
               <p>"Hush, little flatterer," my friend replied, as she placed her hand over my lips; but there was a melancholy in<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6399-00000061"/> her eyes that I could not fathom and dared not question.</p> 
               <p>Much to Madam Sprague's disquiet, Dwight passed his Thanksgiving in Philadelphia amongst some maternal relatives, and soon after signified his intention of remaining there to study art.</p> 
               <p>The Spragues were incensed, and most of his northern friends grew serious over his erratic course Aunt Judy and Peggy alone spoke in his defence. "He was a good youth, an uncommon youth, and if his life was spared, would be an honor to his kindred and country. We should see in time what he would become."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXI.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE MILITARY REVIEW AND BALL.</head> 
               <p>APRIL completed the academic course. As the London pianos had arrived, I accompanied my cousin to town to receive instruction in music, dancing and French.</p> 
               <p>Our teacher, a grave, silent French migr, excited both respect and commiseration. One of the old noblesse, his sphere had been amidst the most refined Parisian circles; now, in old age despoiled of country, friends and home, a precarious livelihood was obtained by those accomplishments which formerly had been his passport to courtly favor.</p> 
               <p>Polly Brown left the seminary with a recommendation that secured the summer school in the "Meeting-house district." James pished and pshawed, declared she had much better attend to her dairy, and let Bethia act the lady school-ma'am. Bethia, however, manifested no inclination for the vacation, and while she excelled in the dairy Polly won both love and respect as teacher.</p> 
               <p>In October, a grand military review was to be held, followed by a ball in the evening. The governor was expected. His Excellency and other distinguished guests were to dine with my Uncle Rutledge, who had been recently appointed a Brigadier-General.</p> 
               <p>As this ball was an opportune period, it was decided that it should introduce Mira and myself to society.</p> 
               <p>Early in the season, the family had removed to their fine new mansion. As it was finished and furnished with magnificence, one would have supposed it fit for the reception of a prince, but Aunt Rutledge, a proud, ambitious woman, as well as a notable housewife, contrived to keep the household in a turmoil the fortnight preceding the gala. The huge "Rumford cookery," monster embryo of the modern range, glowed and roared, devouring sufficient fuel in the two weeks to furnish a moderate sized cook-stove for as many months.</p> 
               <p>Dress was the mighty theme that burdened the waking thoughts and nightly dreams of my cousin and myself. Unfledged belles, the subject was momentous. It should be alike; upon that, was our fixed determination, but what would equally suit a tall, fair blonde, and a short, slight brunette?</p> 
               <p>James at length decided we should wear white muslin, buff gloves and slippers, a gold star upon the left breast, with a girdle to match, our hair in curls, without ornament.</p> 
               <p>Aunt Rutledge interposed, as Miss Lane began her work. "Do not, let them be too low in the bosom, and cut the skirts long, and full enough for decency."</p> 
               <p>"They shall be perfectly modest, Mrs. Rutledge. Did you hear of Miss Norton's accident?"</p> 
               <p>"No, was she in town?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Miss Kate Donaldson had invited her to spend the winter with her. Stepping into Lawyer Knights' chaise the day before, she rent her beautiful India muslin from bottom to top."</p> 
               <p>Regret was expressed, but I fear it was only lip deep. Neither my cousin nor myself could care for the vain, unprincipled girl. She might cajole Miss Kate, and please the opposite sex, but her schoolmates saw her through a different medium. On the morning of the important day, the family were awakened at an early hour by the distant report of firearms.</p> 
               <p>Slipping on her dressing-gown, Mira ran to raise the front windows in expectation of a salute. She was right; soon a company of soldiers defiled before the house.</p> 
               <p>"It is a good thing to possess one's wits. It would have been rather an expensive honor if we had had such a smash as General Howe's house received last muster,-not one whole pane of glass remained in the front sashes. Step here, Jessie, behind this curtain; they can't see us. I am glad to see Captain Merrill out."</p> 
               <p>"Has he been ill?"</p> 
               <p>"Didn't you hear of the accident he met when he was chosen captain?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, they were trying his courage by filing at his legs, and, through carelessness, he received a full charge of powder in one of his calves."</p> 
               <p>"Yes; and only think, he never flinched, and Nurse Patten says he was a model of courage through it all. I hope it will put an end to such foolish customs."</p> 
               <p>"After all our boasted civilization and progress, I sometimes think, Mira, that we are but one remove from barbarism. Put your hands to your ears,-there is the signal to fire!"</p> 
               <p>Crash, bang! went the old flintlock firearms; then James appeared upon the porch; arms were stacked, and the company passed up the steps into the hall.</p> 
               <p>"Everything is ready," said Mira, as she drew a long breath, "I helped father fill the decanters and case bottles last night. There go John Knight and Tom Games, they have begun to drink before sunrise to-day, and they will keep it up till dawn tomorrow."</p> 
               <p>"Will they be presentable this evening?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, yes, only a little excited, as becomes gentlemen after dinner!"</p> 
               <p>"Mira!"</p> 
               <p>"Well, ma chere?"</p> 
               <p>"I cannot see the necessity of accompanying Miss Hastings to Burmah; I shall stay and convert the heathen of this pious town first."</p> 
               <p>"I do not intend to convert anybody."</p> 
               <p>"Not even Tom Carries?"</p> 
               <p>"Not even Tom Games, Miss Wisdom."</p> 
               <p>Breakfast over, our officers donned their martial array. Peacock had long refused oats, "snuffing the battle afar." For the last half hour, Jake had proudly led him in his trappings before the j house, much to the risk of his own bones and the admiration of the neighborhood.</p> 
               <p>A cheer burst from the assembled crowds, as the popular Major Lee vaulted into his saddle, to be renewed as my uncle mounted his powerful parade horse.</p> 
               <p>The arrangement of the dining table had been consigned to Mira and myself, but we were constantly drawn to the window.</p> 
               <p>First, marching to the sound of the fife and drum, came the elegant and aristocratic "Light Infantry," in their uniform of white and blue, and sweeping white plumes. These were followed by the graver artillery, with darker uniform, black feathers, and field pieces drawn by superb black horses.</p> 
               <p>"Isn't the Light Infantry splendid?" inquired Mira.</p> 
               <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6399-00000062"/> 
               <p>"Yes, but I belong to the cavalry or artillery; they seem grander. Here is the Joppah military company."</p> 
               <p>"Do see the women and babies! How I wish Dwight was here!"</p> 
               <p>t twelve, we joined Miss Kate Donaldson and Ann Norton in Mr. Donaldson's carriage, and drove to the muster-field at the " Plains."</p> 
               <p>With a proud display of his mettled steeds, our black coachman made his way through the motley crowd, in its precincts, the usual heterogeneous mass, with the accompanying noise and confusion.</p> 
               <p>Riotous merriment, mingled with wrangling and oaths, proceeded from the numerous refreshment booths. Peddlers were hawking gingerbread, confectionery, and various small wares. Old Uron was limping round with bag and basket, cursing and swearing at the Crowd of boys, who, ripe for fun, followed the "killed man" hither and thither. Babies were squalling, little children crying, mothers coaxing and scolding, and rushing this way and that, after, stray members of the flock. Wild girls were flirting with boisterous beaux, bold, flaunting women called attention by loud, lewd tones. Here and there, knots were gathered round some repulsive creature, a fortune-teller, with her greasy pack of cards, or some like device. Miss Kate leaned forward, exclaiming: "How little one-half the world knows of the other half." Ann drew back: "Wished Pomp would drive faster; we should catch smallpox, or something else, among this horrid set to people."</p> 
               <p>The coach having reached an eligible spot, Pomp drew up with great clat, and, having reset his goal-banded hat, condescended to inform us, "We was jest in time to see de whole affair." As he spoke, a flourish of trumpets announced the approach of the governor and staff, who rode on the field escorted by a fine battalion of cavalry.</p> 
               <p>The usual evolutions succeeded; though there were not the full bands and, splendor of modern equipment, still it was a fine, stirring spectacle.</p> 
               <p>The drill over, one of Gen. Rutledge's aids came to escort us to his markee, where we were introduced to his Excellency. Having partaken of refreshments, the ladies were again conducted to their carriages, which drove to an eligible position to witness the "sham fight." This was the great attraction of the afternoon.</p> 
               <p>A breastwork had been thrown up on a slight eminence; part of the troops and a reserve of horse having been stationed behind this screen, they were attacked by the other half. After a smartly contested mimic battle, the parapet was carried, and victory declared for the besiegers.</p> 
               <p>The business of the day being ended, we joined the retreating throng that filled the road homeward.</p> 
               <p>I was putting the last touches to my dinner dress, when a slight tap called me to the chamber-door.</p> 
               <p>James stood in the passage: "Are you alone?" he whispered. Having received a reply in the affirmative, he added: "William Norton is in my room, too tipsy to appear at table. No one knows his condition. I found him on the field, and got him here without notice. Can't you send up some coffee and eatables by Jake? He is trusty. I must hurry to the drawing-room."</p> 
               <p>"I would manage." My guardian ran down stairs; I followed. The maids were too busy to notice my proceedings. Placing the viands upon a tray, gave them to Jake, with strict injunctions to secrecy. The boy gave a knowing wink, promised "to mind his eye," and vanished.</p> 
               <p>Completely assured, I joined the distinguished party in the parlor. Din ner was immediately announced. His Excellency led out my Aunt Rutledge; my uncle took Mrs. Col. Bladen, the rest followed according to etiquette.</p> 
               <p>I fell to the escort of the young aid, the witty and elegant lawyer, whose chaise had been the cause of the mishap to Ann Norton's dress.</p> 
               <p>This gentleman was an immense favorite with the ladies, and the much sought boon companion of his own sex.</p> 
               <p>The meal passed in the usual style. My companion kept me vastly entertained; I was really sorry when the ladies retired.</p> 
               <p>The gentlemen soon joined us. Tea and coffee having been served, we separated, to dress for the ball.</p> 
               <p>As Jake was lighting us to the carriage that was to convey us thither, I inquired for his patient.</p> 
               <p>"He's ruther shaky yet, but I'll git him along bum-by," with sovereign contempt in look and tone, "He's a green 'un, Miss, got a pesky weak head; it'ill be a time afore we makes him a gentleman."</p> 
               <p>Greatly amused at Jake's idea of a gentleman, I sprang into my seat, devoutly hoping the Squire would never learn poor Bill's mischance.</p> 
               <p>A moment's drive brought us to Washington Hall. A prim, black damsel, in white 'kerchief and yellow turban, awaited the ladies in the anteroom. Having divested ourselves of our shawls, Mira and I were escorted by James and Major Knight into a spacious apartment. Windows draped with red, faced on either; side, wax tapers burned in glittering, glass chandeliers, and violins were tuning in a low gallery at the opposite end. The yellow settees were nearly filled; we were led across the hall to a seat near the orchestra, beside Miss Donaldson and Ann Norton.</p> 
               <p>Miss Kate's petite figure was robed in blue gauze, with long, pendent plumes amid her brown curls. Ann looked lovely in a buff crape, with blue trimmings.</p> 
               <p>As we were novices Miss Kate pointed out the most prominent belles and beaux.</p> 
               <p>"Opposite are the Misses Ray; below, are Miss Fotheringay and her cousin, Miss Miles. The gentlemen call her the evening star; the Kay girls are pronounced beauties, and Ellen Fotheringay is called a wit. You have, made the acquaintance of our beaux of beaux, the handsome Prince John, as the ladies have dubbed Major Knight. At the entrance stands Squire Montgomery, the modern Demosthenes of this region. There is Tom Carnes; he has obtained the sobriquet of the Bishop, he is so wicked."</p> 
               <p>Greatly diverted, I asked if the gentlemen knew of these cognomens.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, indeed; your Cousin James is termed, 'My Lord Superb.'" Much amused at the aptness of this title, I turned to my uncle, who, at this moment approached to inform me that I was to open the ball with the Governor. I had not dreamed of such eminence, and was aghast at the mere idea.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Uncle, choose some one else, please," I pleaded.</p> 
               <p>"No;' Mrs. Bladen does not dance."</p> 
               <p>"But Mira does!"</p> 
               <p>Not so well as yourself; besides, Miss Bradshaw has the precedence."</p> 
               <p>Dear, dear, this horrid heiress-ship! How I despised this polite role of shams! Carlyle has never been more bitter than I was at heart that night. I had little time for philosophy. His Excellency came forward, and with courtly grace, handed me to the top of the hall. My uncle led out Miss Kate, Major Knight advanced to Mira; James, somewhat to my chagrin, chose Ann Norton, I thought the beauty looked a little triumphant as she passed, and<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6399-00000063"/> I was wicked enough to enjoy my place above her.</p> 
               <p>Perfectly reassured, I was able to go down the dance with as much self-possession as if I had been in the parsonage kitchen, with only Dwight for an associate. My distinguished partner paid me the most flattering compliments; adulation and attention were on every side. What girl does not enjoy her first ball? Near midnight, I descried William Norton, pale and downcast, just within the entrance.</p> 
               <p>It was evident that he was much ashamed. His sister was too busy with her admirers to notice him. Beckoning the young man to me, I inquired if he had danced.</p> 
               <p>"No, Jessie; I have a confounded headache."</p> 
               <p>"Not so bad but what you can dance this set with me?"</p> 
               <p>Poor Bill cast a grateful glance, and murmured, "I was too good." but took my extended hand. As I had interred, this kindness was his passport to the highest coterie: he was soon established in the good graces of the most exclusive belles.</p> 
               <p>The night wore on into the small hours. Miss Kate cautioned me against drinking the cordials so freely passed round. "They are too strong, Jessie See those girls in the corner; ar'n't they a little too lively?"</p> 
               <p>"It is time to go home, Miss Kate."</p> 
               <p>"So Mira thinks, but Ann demurs, pronounces us old-maidish prudes and declares she will see the last of it."</p> 
               <p>"No matter what she says, <emph>she shall go.</emph> James, bring Ann into the shawl room!"</p> 
               <p>Pretty, fair la belle reine, will the beautiful Ann obey his behests?" queried Major Knight, as he offered hi arm to gallant me from the hall.</p> 
               <p>"Yes."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I have my consolation for he nonce," he returned, gazing laughingly into my eyes. "The lovely Ann is not exactly an unsophisticated lambkin; she has an eye to the main chance in the shape of a good match."</p> 
               <p>In some surprise, I asked, "If he thought she had sufficient consideration or such strategy?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, she loves admiration,-will have it; but catch her to marry a poor devil like me!"</p> 
               <p>I gravely shook my head, wondering if every young lady was subjected to as strict an analysis as the pretty Ann.</p> 
               <p>Aunt Rutledge awaited our return in night-cap and wrapper. "She was a naughty woman for sitting up!" was pronounced in a breath.</p> 
               <p>"Just as though she could sleep, with half her family dancing to perdition!" was the playful reply.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, ma," Mira saucily retorted, "which is the worst, fibbing or dancing? You know you would have liked to have gone with us. Jessie and I have made a suitable sensation."</p> 
               <p>"So your father tells me, but go to bed, these things are very well once in a while, but don't let them turn your heads."</p> 
               <p>Like the great poet, then just introduced to the public, we awoke to find ourselves famous.</p> 
               <p>Major Knight called the next morning, with the information that the Misses Norton, Rutledge and Bradshaw had become styled the three graces.</p> 
               <p>Mira pouted, and declared it "too bad to be mixed up with that deceitful minx; she seemed born for our plague."</p> 
               <p>I had a good fit, and reminded her that "charity suffereth long"; which elicited the command, "Not to counterfeit piety."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">FASHIONABLE LIFE AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE PRESENT CENTURY.</head> 
               <p>MY cousin and myself were now fairly launched on the sea of fashionable life. Since the Revolution, the West India trade and foreign commerce had greatly enriched the place, and many of its merchants had acquired vast wealth. These lived in a style now unknown to a town of its size. Before the Revolution, all our idea of elegance had been derived from England, and, at this period, the country had not thrown off this allegiance. English style and mode of life were affected by our gentry, in their spacious mansions, well-stocked wine cellars, heavy family coaches, superb horses, and liveried Servants.</p> 
               <p>Many of these domestics were blacks. Some few, that after emancipation preferred to remain in families where they had found an easy bondage, or descendants of slave parents, who still clung to the home where they had been born and nurtured.</p> 
               <p>Luxurious indolence, rich dinners, with long sittings over the wine and dessert, card parties of an evening, with a hot meat supper at nine or ten o'clock, was the usual routine in many of our first families.</p> 
               <p>Embargo and non-intercourse had impoverished some; but the cloud that was to overshadow our commercial sky was then only a mere speck on the horizon. Though some distinguished families showed signs of retrenchment, and others, by nicely darned laces, made-over brocades, and tarnished liveries, evinced the keeping up of appearances; the majority went on in the full tide of prosperity.</p> 
               <p>The coterie into which I was introduced,-sons and daughters of these households,-consisted of delicately-bred Misses, proficient in everything that was then considered requisite in a lady; and highly educated, courtly gentlemen, too many of whom, I am sorry to say, might in these days come under the cognomen of "fast young men."</p> 
               <p>Our circle of beaux was enlarged by the numerous law students, who flocked to the place to profit by the instruction of that eminent jurist, the late Judge P--.</p> 
               <p>These, with the addition of a few young merchants and clerks from the country, constituted the gentlemen of our <foreign xml:lang="FRA">beau-monde.</foreign>
               </p> 
               <p>The morning was usually devoted to making calls and the reception of visitors, when the on-dits of the day, and the last novel, were discussed over a bit of cake and a glass of wine.</p> 
               <p>The afternoons passed in practising a new tune, reading a new book, or working at some dainty needle-work.</p> 
               <p>We had no publishing houses to issue a book a day; our reading nearly all came from England, but we were pretty well supplied with the prim, love-laden effusions that had delighted our mothers. Miss Opie's, Miss Porter's and Mrs. Radcliffe's novels were, greatly in vogue. When I first came to town, "Elizabeth, or the Exiles of Siberia," and the "Hungarian Brothers," were the novelties under discussion, but that winter the "Wizard of the North" cast every competitor into the shade, enchained the whole reading community by his magic pen.</p> 
               <p>The evenings, when not spent abroad, or in formal parties at home, were enlivened by social calls from gentlemen friends, who talked politics with my uncle and James (we were usually all Federalists, few Democrats found their way into our distinguished circle), discussed books, or sang and flirted with Mira and myself.</p> 
               <p>Seldom could have been found a<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6399-00000064"/> more talented or better informed band of young men than the one that often surrounded our work-table. Some have become eminent in the land, but too many, alas, have long filled ignoble graves.</p> 
               <p>Squire Montgomery, magniloquent and polite, was a perfect prince of gallants. One half forgave Tom Carnes' excessive dissipation, while listening to his brilliant conversation, or his magnificent rendering of Shakspeare and Ben Johnson. Lawyer Knight was the king of agreeable fellows, always knew exactly what to say, and how to say it; what to do and how to do it, and his remarkable musical abilities shone conspicuously after a few glasses. Though he drank like a fish, he was never the worse for it.</p> 
               <p>Looking back upon this period, cannot forbear wondering why we did not freeze with the thin clothing then worn. Surely, the multiplicity and breadth of skirts now so fashionable is better than to wear next to none, and those too scant to step in freely, as so many did at that time. Scarcely any fashionably dressed young lady could step over a moderate gutter or puddle without a leap, and others, like Ann Norton, found it difficult to get into a chaise. Then, as white, or a fancy gauze were the only genteel full dress, we were often exposed in this thin attire, with bare necks and arms, to all the rigidity of a New England winter. Silks were admissible for home, social gathering! and the street, and bombazettes came that season, but white was worn almost universally among young ladies for evening dress, special calls, and to church, on pleasant Sundays.</p> 
               <p>What would one think now, if compelled to wear a white cambric dress into a cold meeting-house, some snapping January morning, with no thicker covering than a wrapper of delicate pelisse cloth, lined with flannel, and a fur muff and tippet? Those huge muffs, and the tin foot-stoves must have been our safeguards. Without them, we most assuredly must have perished.</p> 
               <p>A very genteel Miss did become so benumbed on one occasion that when the amen was pronounced at the end of a long prayer, she had not consciousness enough to sit down, but remained standing till borne forth by her frightened friends.</p> 
               <p>The autumn of which I am writing, after several stormy parish meetings, it was decided by the society of the First Church, where my Uncle Rutledge's family attended, to follow the recent Boston fashion, arid set an iron stove in the house.</p> 
               <p>Owing to some mistake about the fuel, no fire was lighted, the first Sunday after the stove had been placed in the building. As we came from morning service, Aunt Rutledge inquired of one of the deacons, how he had liked the sermon.</p> 
               <p>"Dunno, marm, dunno!" he hurriedly replied, rubbing his forehead. "That tarnal, new-fangled stove, has numbed up my head so that I can't jestly recall a word on't; never had sich a headache in my life; if the congregation can stand that heat, I can't."</p> 
               <p>This was too good a joke to be forgotten, and for a long time the poor deacon was tormented with anxious inquiries respecting the state of his head.</p> 
               <p>The military ball, though so early, fairly began the season. Party succeeded party, and, after "Thanksgiving," a series of assemblies were held once a fortnight at Washington Hall, where the young folks danced, while their seniors amused themselves round whist tables, set out in the anterooms</p> 
               <p>Business had called James south the week after the review, and though such a journey was a serious affair, in those days, we had confidently expected him back by "Thanksgiving;" but "Christmas" was at hand, and he had not made his appearance, and we could not gather from his short business notes any sufficient reason for his prolonged absence.</p> 
               <p>One afternoon as I was sitting alone, bending over the pages of "Marmion," which Mr. Knight had just brought, I was almost overthrown by two great, shaggy paws suddenly placed upon my shoulders, while a cold nose was thrust against my face, with a salute more hearty than agreeable; at the same time, my low rocking-chair was drawn back, and a pair of warm lips were pressed upon my forehead.</p> 
               <p>"Why, Turk, you darling old doggy," I exclaimed, as I threw my arms round the neck of the now huge, middle-aged dog: "Where did you come from?"</p> 
               <p>"Here, spare a few of those kisses for a darling young biped," said a voice in the rear.</p> 
               <p>"Are you in the body or out of it, Dwight? Did you and Turk enter by the keyhole, or through the closed door?"</p> 
               <p>"We came in like good Christians, as we are, mam'selle. You must have been reading a love-letter not to have heard us."</p> 
               <p>"It is better than a love-letter; but come round here and let me look at you, young man."</p> 
               <p>With a great show of humility, Dwight came and knelt at my feet. "Marmion," he exclaimed, picking up the volume, which I had dropped in my surprise. "I will forgive you for being oblivious to even my proximity. Well, Miss Wisdom, what do you think of me?"</p> 
               <p>"That you have partaken pretty freely of the tree of good and evil during your absence."</p> 
               <p>"All hail, Minerva, goddess of wisdom! and here comes a goddess of love and beauty," he added, with a laugh, as he sprang to his feet to meet Mira, who at that moment entered.</p> 
               <p>We were all glad to get Dwight back, and he immediately became the bosom friend of all the young men, and the great favorite of all the ladies, both old and young.</p> 
               <p>I was sorry to find, that, though he had acquired a great deal of valuable information, had studied anatomy, and otherwise perfected himself in his artistical studies, during his residence in Philadelphia, he had not become any steadier, or more likely to bring his superior talents to practical use. Present enjoyment seemed his only aim, and I was often far from pleased at his mode of amusement. It gave me many pangs to see him, day after day, join the heedless revelry of the gay set, his fellow-boarders, at the "Wolf House."</p> 
               <p>I sometimes ventured to remonstrate, but he only laughed, vowed I was too wise for common mortals, and left me to flirt with Ann Norton or roll ninepins with Torn Carnes and Sawyer Knight. A fortnight had passed in this manner, when Dwight came with the information that he should start for Boston at twelve o'clock.</p> 
               <p>"Don't look too forlorn, Miss Wisdom. I am really and truly called there by business. Will you please lend Mrs. Lowe that miniature that! painted of your cousin, Jessie? She wishes to copy the background."</p> 
               <p>It is at the parsonage. She can have yours,-the grounds are alike."</p> 
               <p>I went up-stairs and brought the picture, with Mrs. Sprague's chain attached.</p> 
               <p>Dwight's face lighted. "I did not dream of your having this one here. You never wear it."</p> 
               <p>"Do you expect me to sport your miniature?"</p> 
               <p>"There are many that would be proud to do so, Miss Wisdom."</p> 
               <pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6399-00000065"/> 
               <p>"Perhaps you would be proud to have them; if so, you are welcome to the picture."</p> 
               <p>With a long, low whistle, I was bidden not to get rabid before he got back.</p> 
               <p>I was sorry for my speech. Petulance was a poor aid for reformation. I would do better in future. The day passed; I wondered Mrs. Lowe did not return the picture. She needed it only a few hours, Dwight had said.</p> 
               <p>The evening was spent at Mr. Donaldson's. I noticed that Ann wore a chain like Dwight's mother's. Had he taken me at my word, and given the ornament to Ann? I could not tell whether the miniature was attached; if so, it was hidden beneath her sash. Suspecting some roguish trick, I determined to keep quiet.</p> 
               <p>The next evening, Dwight came back. For the first time since his return from Philadelphia, he seemed anxious and dispirited.</p> 
               <p>The picture had not arrived, but I resolved not to mention it.</p> 
               <p>We were a gay party, but Dwight sat by my aunt's table snipping shreds in silence. As the other visitors left, he rose, dropped the scissors, and turning to me, asked if "Mrs. Lowe had returned my miniature?"</p> 
               <p>I looked him steadily in the eyes, as I answered in the negative. "That's strange," he returned, in the same absent manner he had shown through the interview.</p> 
               <p>I saw that I had misjudged him; had Mrs. Lowe forgotten the loan?</p> 
               <p>I was alone sewing the following morning, when Dwight came in. He wore the same sober face. I had found that in these taciturn fits it was best not to be curious. We had sat some moments in silence, when I espied Miss Donaldson daintily tripping across the street.</p> 
               <p>She entered with her usual affected air, exclaiming, "I trust I do not interrupt a tete-a-tete, but really, Mr. Sprague, I felt it incumbent upon me to inquire if you knew that Ann Norton was publicly wearing your miniature?"</p> 
               <p>"What!" demanded Dwight, with such an air of amazement as is seldom depicted.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Mr. Dwight," responded Miss Kate, "for the past few days she has been wearing your likeness suspended from a gold chain."</p> 
               <p>"The deuce she has; where in Heaven's name did she get it? Why did you not tell me of this last night, Jessie? Oh, I forget; of course you did not know it."</p> 
               <p>I felt ashamed to own that I did, but after a moment's hesitation, replied that Ann had on the chain the evening of Miss Kate's party.</p> 
               <p>"Why, in the name of wonder did you not claim it, or at least, demand her right to it?"</p> 
               <p>With hot cheeks, I stammered out something about not knowing but that he desired her to have it. A frown had been gathering upon Dwight's brow as I spoke; springing up, with flashing eyes, he exclaimed, "Jessie, I never could have believed you such a simpleton. Ann shall rue this "; and, seizing his hat, he darted across the street to Mr. Donaldson's.</p> 
               <p>"What a spirit the young man has, when it is roused, though usually so sweet tempered," said Miss Kate, as the door closed upon him. "I would n't be Ann for considerable. So you and Dwight have had a quarrel!" she continued, seating herself to see the matter out. "I suspected as much; well, a love spat is the spice of courtship, but always make up, my dear, yes," and there was a little sigh; "remember my words, and, my young friend, <emph>always wake them up."</emph>
               </p> 
               <p>I was trying to impress it upon Miss Kate's incredulous conception that Dwight and I were anything but lovers, when our hero returned, and, with comical grimace, tossed the chain and miniature into my lap, bidding me "rub off the contamination." Then sinking upon the sofa, he indulged in an unrestrained fit of merriment.</p> 
               <p>It was impossible not to laugh with him, but Miss Kate was loud in her importunities for an explanation.</p> 
               <p>It appeared that Mrs. Lowe had given Ann the likeness the afternoon it had been borrowed, with the request that she would return it to me; instead of complying, she had appropriated it to herself.</p> 
               <p>"It is a sequel to the sum larceny, Jessie. Ann's ideas seem somewhat confused upon some matters," said Dwight, wiping his eyes.</p> 
               <p>"She is sufficiently clear-headed to undertake her own interest," indignantly replied Miss Kate, "but how did she excuse her conduct?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, she kept it for fun, to see what Jessie and the rest would say." You ought to have seen the smile, with which she added, "I knew you could not scold me very hard, and I meant to return the picture to-day."</p> 
               <p>"I hope you told her she was an artful piece of wax-work, as she is," responded Miss Kate. "I believe she wanted to make mischief; such things have often embittered a lifetime. I have no patience with the girl. Mrs. White has invited her to Haverhill, and I shall pack of Miss Beauty as soon as possible."</p> 
               <p>What slight things will change the whole course of existence! Little did Dwight and I imagine the effect Miss Kate's decision would have upon our lives; little did she foresee that by it she had sealed Ann's doom!</p> 
               <p>Mira entered at this moment, with the intelligence that it was a current report that Ann was engaged to Mr. Sprague.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Sprague thought they had had anything but a lover-like interview within the hour, but there was no knowing what might happen,-this was a strange world. Turning to me, he added, in a graver tone, "Jessie, I must ride up to the master's this morning; may I have the pleasure of your company?"</p> 
               <p>"Certainly! I was pining for the parsonage."</p> 
               <p>It was a bright, though cold day, and good sleighing; the ride was very exhilarating to me, but my companion maintained his former thoughtful silence. For the first time, I feared to press his confidence; as we neared our destination, he bent forward, and with a quizzical look, that brought the color to my face, inquired "how I came to make such a blunder as to distrust him? Don't look so distressed, Puss. I am delighted to find my goddess Minerva can mistake now and then. I have been very naughty lately, but am now going to turn that new leaf."</p> 
            </div>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">NEWS.</head> 
               <p>AFTER a warm welcome, and an hour's conversation with Aunt Compton, I went into the kitchen; Peggy immediately commenced a recital of home-news, the sayings and doings of the neighborhood.</p> 
               <p>"Goody Sloper had bewitched Mr. Turner, the joiner; he could n't repair her house jest when she wanted, and he'd been raving ever since."</p> 
               <p>"Why, Peggy, the man is insane. Goody Sloper isn't answerable for it."</p> 
               <p>Peggy gave an immense huff, "She shouldn't dispute me, I'd laming, was a great lady by all accounts, had danced with the governor, but the Goody came in, when all the doors<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6399-00000066"/> were shet, in the shape of a great gray cat, and walked round his room."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Peggy, how can you talk such nonsense!" I exclaimed.</p> 
               <p>"Don't you believe Squire Norton, child?"</p> 
               <p>"I dare say he saw a cat in the room, but I do not believe that it had anything to do with the Goody."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I hope you believe in the witch of Endor, if you don't in Goody Sloper," Peggy replied, with pursed-up lips.</p> 
               <p>I laughed, and inquired for Parson Kirkwood.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, he's serving mammon and the Lord as usual. Begging things to specerlate on week days, and preaching agin French infidelity and fashions Sundays. He didn't say nothing, how-sumever, agin the parish giving his wife a black satin cloak and sable muff and tippet."</p> 
               <p>"I'm sure she needed them. Did they get them by subscription?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, and Aunt Nabby had the cloak made up at her house. I don't say nothing agin Miss Kirkwood's friends agreeing among themselves to make her a present, but I don't like these 'scription papers. Folks feel kind o' 'shamed to refuse to give when they're brought in, and a good many will give when they can't afford it, and others will put down a larger sum than they can spare, 'cause Miss Squire or Gineral or Colonel Somebody has gin so much. They're no force! Poor Miss Pike put down a dollar towards Miss Kirkwood's things, and you know, ever since her house was burnt, she has had scarcely enough clothes to be decent Sabba-day."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, they ought not to have called upon her. I will send her my fox muff and tippet; I do not need them now I have my new sables. But what did you mean when you said the parson begged things to speculate upon?"</p> 
               <p>"Why, he gin out last fall that he couldn't afford to keep a horse, so yer aunt and the 'Squire, and some of the Main-road folks, sent ever so many loads of hay; I guess in the whole, it amounted to nigh six ton. Well, what did he do but sell horse, hay and all!"</p> 
               <p>"That did not look just the thing, but perhaps the parson wanted to buy some expensive books, or something that he thought he needed more than the horse. Ministers have wants that we know nothing of, and you ought not to be too hard upon them, Peggy."</p> 
               <p>"I ain't, but folks talk a good deal. It don't look well to see our minister walking about and begging rides; people that don't know the sarcumstances must think we are a mean set."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I am sorry this should have happened. Clergymen should be extremely circumspect. Their delinquencies do more hurt to the cause of religion than we can calculate, and the same must be said of all who profess to be followers of Christ."</p> 
               <p>"That's truer than any of Parson Kirkwood's preaching; for you must know I've attended on't lately, and last Sunday the whole congregation was in a giggle."</p> 
               <p>"Why, what was the matter?"</p> 
               <p>"Ye know the parish allers draws the minister eight cords of wood off the 'Parsonage' lot. Well, last year Parson Kirkwood complained that it wasn't enough, so our folks begun to inquire into the matter, as in course they didn't want their minister pinched for fuel. What did they diskiver but that the parson had sold several logs for timber sticks. Last week the wood was drawn for this year, and Sargant Jones went to working it up. The first day, the parson came out in the forenoon, and says, 'Mr. Jones, there are some fine trunnel logs, it is a pity to chop them for firewood. You may put them aside.' The sargant said, jest as you say, and Mr. Kirkwood went in to dinner. Arter he had gone, the sargent went to work splitting up the logs jest as fast as he was able, for he said he wan't a-going to have them sold, and then have it told that the parish didn't give their minister enough wood. He'd jest got the last stick open, when the parson appeared. 'Oh, Mr. Jones,' said he, 'I intended to have saved those logs; I told you not to split them.'</p> 
               <p>"'Did ye,' said the sargant, putting on a perplexed look. 'Now, really, I didn't understand ye, I'm a leetle hard o'hearing sometimes.'-'Is that the reason you do not come to meeting, Mr. Jones?' inquired the parson. 'Yes,' said the sargant. 'Then come and set in the pulpit next Sunday, Mr. Jones,' said the parson, as perlite as ye please.</p> 
               <p>"So last Sabba day, the sargant dressed himself up. Ye know he allers has a decent suit, if he is poor, (these Revolutionary officers are mighty particular about their dress), and as soon as Parson Kirkwood had come in, the sargant followed him up the pulpit stairs in a blue coat with bright buttons, buff waistcoat, white neck handkercher, and his hair cued down with a bran new black ribben. Oh, it was a sight to see him go up, with his military air and his grave bow. The parson turned as black as a thundercloud, but he returned the sargant's salertation, then jumped up and begun the sarvice; but it was enough to kill ye, to see the sargant setting there so grave, listening so attentive, with his hand behind his ear all through the sarmon, 'cause ye know he's no more deaf than I am."</p> 
               <p>I joined heartily in the laugh with which Peggy ended her recital, then rose to prepare to make some calls.</p> 
               <p>I shall bring Polly Brown back with me, Peggy, so get something nice for dinner.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, yes, child; did ye s'pose I should forgit-ye want here Thanksgiving. La, sakes, it seemed like a Sunday! And Polly is the most desarving of gals. She comes over to the master's to study every night, and they have got on nicely at the lieutenant's this year. He hardly ever drinks a drop of liquor, and folks says he'll get forehanded if he goes on, and the children does as well as they have."</p> 
               <p>"It is all owing to Polly, Peggy."</p> 
               <p>"Yes; that's what everybody is sensible on. She is very much respected, and is to teach our school agin this summer."</p> 
               <p>My first call was upon the sisters Neal. I found-all, except the invalid, busily spinning within a recess before the fire, formed by a coverlet stretched screen-like from a nail above the mantel, to another in the great beam overhead. This was a universal fashion in those primitive times. I received a hearty welcome, and was ushered into Aunt Susy's bedroom, whom I was happy to find sitting up in her great chair, also draped with the ever useful checked woolen coverlet, stores of which could then be found in every house. The master was at school. After a pleasant half hour's chat, I took leave, and proceeded to the new "parsonage." Mrs. Kirkwood evinced much pleasure at seeing me, and was happy to hear from her friends in town. The parson also came from his study, and conversed full ten minutes with a remarkably urbane manner.</p> 
               <p>As I left the house, I espied Goody Sloper coming in the opposite "direction. As we approached, she began to smile and courtesy. I called out to her to turn herself into that great gray cat, as I should delight to witness the metamorphosis. She laughed, but in a grave tone inquired, if it was not hard to have such things laid to her charge. "God knows, Miss Jessie,<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6399-00000067"/> that I never wished Jiner Turner harm, and would help him if I could, I have been spinning some yarn for Miss Turner now; but she is afeared to let me step foot in the house. I don't want to press in, but I really think she believes that I can't pass under the horseshoe above the fore door."</p> 
               <p>I told the Goody wise people always bad to pay a penalty for their knowledge. "And I know you are a witch, Goody, so you need n't look to me for sympathy. You remember you told my fortune just here, the first day I ever went to the master's school."</p> 
               <p>With a bright, searching look, she replied: "And it has all come true; I know by the look in yer eyes. Sorrow, care and heartache to the beautiful heiress as well as to the poor old witch; but the sun shines, though the day is dark. Never ye fear; stick by the lad; he is a wild lad and a wayward, but he will be yer stay when all the rest are falling."</p> 
               <p>"Is that a fact now, Goody?" I laughingly inquired. "I wish I knew you were inspired; but good-by, and if I am in danger, do turn into that cat and warn me!"</p> 
               <p>The old woman displayed all her yellow, irregular fangs, and passed on with a blessing and good-day.</p> 
               <p>I next came to the residence of the insane man. Thinking that his wife might find a small present acceptable, I went in. Poor Mrs. Turner, with many tears, recited her sad tale. She had just as much faith in witches as she had in her Bible, and the whole house was defended by horseshoes and like charms against the powers of darkness. She was sure her husband was bewitched. Goody Sloper's kindness had somewhat shaken the opinion that it was through her malign influence, but she was the no less sure that it was owing to some one whom her poor husband had unwittingly offended.</p> 
               <p>The crazy man in the next room having heard my voice, insisted upon my coming in to see him. I had never seen an insane person, and felt a little timid. Not being willing to disappoint him, however, I mustered courage to pass the entry, to the other front room. The opening door displayed so sad a sight that I at once forgot everything but compassion. The windows were boarded, to the upper panes which caused a twilight gloom to reign within the large apartment, which had been divested of almost every article of furniture. Poor Mr. Turner, chained by one leg to a staple in the floor, was sitting upon a heavy chest, near the centre of the room. His hair and beard, of many weeks' growth fell amidst his soiled and torn garments, and his eyes gleamed through the dim light like two coals.</p> 
               <p>"Come here, my little beauty; don't you be scared," he cried. "Sit down in that chair, they have set it out of my reach 'cause I smash 'em. Don't they stare!</p> 
               <p>"They think it's witches, but 'taint, the witches went up Crane-neck road, I see 'em. Want it a sight! Old women on broomsticks, and young gals kicking up their heels, and the divil ahead piping away.</p> 
               <p>"Up they went till they got to South end. Parson Stuart up to Varmont, was praying and singing Methody prayers and hymns, which were as good as a necklace of horseshoes round yer Grandmarm's neck; they never went nigh her. Aunt Nabby was rubbing a cheese for Parson Kirk-wood, so they couldn't touch her. Uncle John was warming himself afore the fire in y'er Grandsir's old arm chair, in course they hadn't power to touch him in that seat. He looked round, toasted fust one hand then tother, and said: 'Yes, yes,-Yes, yes.' So the divil struck up agin, and on they squirled to Farmer Prime's. He was in the cider mill, hurrying up old White. Hearing the noise, he set to hearkening, but when he found it was old Nick, he was awful flustered-('cause ye know he knows the old feller is his fust cousin)-so he hollered 'Terap, 'Terap' with all his might. Old 'White' kicked right and left; among it all, there was sich a racket the whole troop branched off, and run hilter-skilter down Steep Bank into Rocky Hollow, then across the paster into Crane meadow, and they never stopped till they all fell into Crane pond. That was the end of the witches, little lady."</p> 
               <p>The description of the reception of the witches by Uncle John and Mr. Prime was so characteristic, that I could not but be much diverted.</p> 
               <p>With a knowing look the lunatic proceeded. "Squire Norton thought our old Suke was a witch, and he was so scared the night he set up with me he dursent stay with me here, but went into t'other room. Every once in a while he would open the door a crack, and squeak out, 'Don't ye want a lettle caffee, Mr. Turner?' It was caffee, caffee, caffee. He made me so mad, at last, that I told him I'd caffee him if he didn't hold his infernal tongue. Didn't I kick up a ringtum! Oh 'twas fun to see the 'squire shrinking and shaking, his great, white goggle eyes sticking clean out of his head, and his teeth chattering as if he had an ager fit.</p> 
               <p>"Well, I acted so, the old woman sent for Parson Kirkwood, to see if he could n't lay the foul fiend.</p> 
               <p>"But it was no go, though I told him I'd a litter of pigs in the pen, and he might pitch the divil into 'em. I told him to sarve um like those of the Gadarenes."</p> 
               <p>With a lower tone, in the most confidential manner, he continued: "Between you and me, Jessie, I think the Lord was ruther hard that time. It must have been a considerable loss, and taken the owner out of a good round sum. I've been trying to calkerlate the amount. Look here,"-pointing to some chalk figures upon the floor; "I've been ciphering it out, but ye see it don't state the price a head, only the number of swine in the drove, so I can't make out their value.</p> 
               <p>"Parson Kirkwood can't hold a candle to Peter Pindar's parish priest. He was a rare one; pity we couldn't get him over our parish. Did you ever read about him, Jessie?" As I replied in the negative, my companion repeated part of a poem, which I afterwards found in "Lowe's Almanack for 1797."</p> 
               <p>"He was a Romish priest ye see, Jessie, and he <q>

               </p> 
               <p>"Parson Kirkwood would like the Saint's emoluments, I take it, little lady; but he's elected so no matter. Self knowledge, self knowledge, bright eyes! You and I and the Goody knows! Yes, we know," he continued, with a knowing wink and a shrewd pursing-up of the lips. I rose to take leave; beckoning me to approach, in the lowest whisper, I was directed to tell Dwight to come to unchain him, shave his beard and cut his hair. "Tell him he must unboard the windows, too, for the witches are dead; they hadn't nothing to do with it, though. The fact is, I've plagued the<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6399-00000068"/> folks long enough; I'm gwine to behave now. Won't my old woman be glad?" I wondered how he knew Dwight came with me, but promised to deliver his message. After this spectacle, it was refreshing to seat myself in Mrs. Brown's neat kitchen. I found Polly and Bethia spinning, While the elder sister at the same time superintended the education of two little girls, who were too small for the winter school. Mrs. Brown, looking younger and prettier than ever, sat, knitting work in hand, jogging the cradle, in which lay the new baby, while the old one tottled about by the aid of the furniture. I directed Polly to set by her wheel, as I should claim her the rest of the day. As we passed the master's on our way to the parsonage, I called to deliver Mr. Turner's message to Dwight.</p> 
               <p>He was poring over a huge law tome, while other legal works lay scattered beside him. It was evidently an exertion for the young man to bring his thought to present realities; but at the mention of the poor lunatic, his interest revived: "Yes, he would attend to him."</p> 
               <p>Polly added a word of caution: "The crazy man was very strong and cunning."</p> 
               <p>"We need have no fears." The brow again knotted into that first abstracted look, as he resumed his reading.</p> 
               <p>"What has Dwight on his mind?" asked Polly, as we turned homeward.</p> 
               <p>"I did not know; could not conjecture." A, long, confidential talk ensued; such an outpouring as does the heart good. Blessed are those who possess a friend with whom they can share such communion.</p> 
               <p>After dinner, Aunt Compton sent for Aunt Nabby and Cousin Ruthy and her baby. I had not before seen this newcomer, a nice boy, his great-grandfather's namesake.</p> 
               <p>Dwight came to tea. His face wore its most genial expression, and he was in excellent spirits. He had shaved and dressed Mr. Turner without trouble, and while his wife was cleansing the room, had taken the lunatic a short ride. "You never saw such a change," tie added, "if he is treated properly, I do not anticipate any further trouble."</p> 
               <p>This prediction was realized; though the poor man continued deranged in intellect till the latest hour of a long life, he was never again a maniac.</p> 
               <p>As we were about to leave, Polly requested the loan of my French grammar.</p> 
               <p>"Going to study French by yourself, Polly? With all your capacity, I scarcely think you can do it."</p> 
               <p>"I shall not be able to pronounce correctly, but I can acquire the rudiments of the language."</p> 
               <p>"Where there is a will there is a way." I brought the book with the full assurance that Polly would soon become proficient in her new study.</p> 
               <p>On our way home, Dwight asked "What I thought of his reading law?"</p> 
               <p>"That the study will be prosecuted with vigor while the novelty lasts, then it will be thrown up in disgust."</p> 
               <p>"Your discernment will be tested, Miss Wisdom. To-morrow, I shall enter Squire Montgomery's office as a law student."</p> 
               <p>It was much better than idleness. I earnestly hoped he might persevere; attention and application were necessary for any calling.</p> 
               <p>It was past eight when we left the parsonage; the nine o'clock bell had clone ringing before we drove to Uncle Rutledge's door. Jake came out bearing a lantern, his face the personification of astonishment. "Oh, Miss Jessie," he shouted, ere we had fairly stopped, "sich news only think on't-the Major has gone and got married down South, to a Popish French gal!"</p> 
                
               <p>"Married! What major?"</p> 
               <p>"Why, our major! Yer cousin, Major Lee. The general has jist brought the letter from the offis. Gorry, we are in a pretty considerable conflusteration!"</p> 
               <p>James married! I waited for neither shawls nor bundles, springing up the steps, I met my relatives in the hall. Their blank faces, and the "Oh, Jessie!" with which I was saluted confirmed Jake's statement.</p> 
               <p>"Give me the letter," I gasped as I sank upon the sofa. My uncle handed it, Dwight peered over my shoulder. The epistle was short. My guardian had been married the previous week in Philadelphia to Mademoiselle Genevieve De Morney, the only child of the late Count De Morney, a French exile of note.</p> 
               <p>At his arrival at the hotel in that city he had been struck by the decrepitude of the father, and the devotion of the daughter. That same night his aid was invoked at the death-bed of the former. Sympathy for the destitute lady, a stranger in a strange land, had ended in marriage. The missive closed with an appeal in behalf of his Catholic bride.</p> 
               <p>There was a moment's silence as I refolded the letter. Then I burst forth, "Who could have believed that James would have done such an unwise thing? What will Grandma'am and the rest say?"</p> 
               <p>"Won't there be a sensation?" cried Mira "How Aunt Nabby will hold forth. A Papist! Horror!"</p> 
               <p>Dwight laughed. "How the good woman will exhort upon the sin of espousing a strange damsel, a daughter of the 'scarlet abomination,' the mother of lies,' the harlot of the Seven Hills!"</p> 
               <p>"Who can blame her, Dwight?" interposed Aunt Rutledge, with asperity. "Poor Father! I am glad he does not see this hour. James is just like every other man, a perfect fool when marriage is the question."</p> 
               <p>"Now, mother, I beg leave to modify that sentiment," Uncle Rutledge good naturedly replied, "but there is little to be hoped from an unequal match, James had much better have taken Miss Donaldson."</p> 
               <p>"Poor Miss Kate will be cast in the shade beside this beauty, for of course she is beautiful; James always has been carried away by a pretty face."</p> 
               <p>"True, Jessie," said Mira, "we should have had Ann Norton for a cousin, if our gentleman had not been so fully acquainted with her antecedents and surroundings"</p> 
               <p>"I am afraid James is too worldly," sighed Aunt Rutledge.</p> 
               <p>"It seems to me that he has greatly changed since Grandsir's death," I rejoined.</p> 
               <p>"He has grown proud and exclusive," added Mira.</p> 
               <p>"Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses, because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married; for he had married an Ethiopian woman," exclaimed Dwight in a serio-comical tone.</p> 
               <p>It was impossible not to laugh, but we all felt the rebuke. We were cherishing wrong and uncharitable thoughts. James had a right to please himself, and though, like other mortals, imperfect, ha was both good and noble.</p> 
               <p>After an half hour's discussion, it was decided to make the best of the affair, and receive the bride and bridegroom with due honor.</p> 
               <p>A French countess was no despicable connection. Her religion ought not to prove a ban,-very likely we should convert her to Protestanism,-the French usually were anything but bigots. Mira and I fell asleep full of curiosity and anticipation.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE BRIDE.</head> 
               <p>IT was a cloudy, cheerless afternoon, the last day of the year. The house and ourselves were in festive array, for at four o'clock James and his bride were expected. The news of this singular marriage had caused as great a sensation as any of Bonaparte's then oft-recurring victories. Groups of gentlemen had gathered round the entrance of the "Wolf Tavern," and one or two other commanding points. Madam Donaldson's turban could be descried at her chamber window, while Miss Kate's brown ringlets peeped from the one below.</p> 
               <p>With characteristic energy, Miss Kate had the week before manuvred Ann Norton to Haverhill. How much James' marriage had facilitated Miss Donaldson's design, Mira and I could not determine.</p> 
               <p>My uncle's family had assembled in the front drawing-room. Mira and I, with a bevy of the younger children, gathered about the end windows, from which we should catch the first glimpse of the approaching vehicle.</p> 
               <p>With its accustomed punctuality, the four o'clock stage appeared over the brow of the distant turnpike hill. First, the four white horses, then the clumsy, yellow-bodied, gaudily ornamented, three-seated coach. Swiftly down the road it came, across High street, and with an immense flourish Jehu drew up before the house.</p> 
               <p>Jake threw wide the hall door; my uncle and aunt stepped forward, Mira and I followed. There was the clang of steps, the stage door opened and James sprang to the ground. He certainly looked much paler and thinner, more thoughtful and grave, than ever before. A petite figure, in the deepest mourning, was handed forth. Ascending the portico steps, she threw back the heavy crape veil, disclosing one of the palest, saddest faces, and a pair of the most sorrowful black eyes I ever beheld.</p> 
               <p>How different was this from the gay beauty we had anticipated! My heart instinctively yearned to her on the instant.</p> 
               <p>"Poor thing!" whispered Mira. She looks like a ghost! That mourning is a dreadful bad sign for a bride. She will have trouble I fear. James must have married her from sheer pity."</p> 
               <p>Was it so? Pity must have been the foundation for his love, I thought, as I welcomed my new relative and embraced my guardian. His eager kiss, and tremulous tones of tenderness, assured me that I was as near his heart as ever, even more so, and I could now return his affection in the open, sisterly manner I desired.</p> 
               <p>The prediction of the lady in the dancing-room, and that of numerous good people since, could now never be verified.</p> 
               <p>With very different emotions from what had been expected, the bride was seated in our midst. Who could resist that sad, winning face, those gentle, graceful, appealing manners?</p> 
               <p>At first sight, every one pronounced Mrs. Lee plain, but upon acquaintance, this decision was always revoked. Her loveliness did not depend upon mere form and color, it was that something more than physical beauty; that soul painting, ever varying, ever enchanting. Her somewhat trying position was sustained with an ease and grace that won a respect and admiration which soon ripened into love. As it was found she was averse to entering society so soon after her father's death, a quiet family gathering took the place of the party Aunt Rutledge had proposed.</p> 
                
               <p>Most of those invited were present, and however much disposed to cavil, it was difficult to find fault with the French woman; and as she accompanied her husband to meeting, and appeared as good a Protestant as the best, they were wholly disarmed upon that score.</p> 
               <p>Aunt Nabby alone refused an introduction. In her tartest tones, she declared us all "in the gall of bitterness and bond of iniquity, devoured with the lusts of the flesh and the pride of life. She was afeared Sister Rutledge would have a great deal to answer, for, and she a professor."</p> 
               <p>Aunt Rutledge desired the newly married pair to remain with her through the winter, but James was anxious to set up his own hearth-stone. A house was purchased, and furnished with that chaste elegance which appeared inherent in Genevieve; a taste that was duly reciprocated and appreciated by her husband.</p> 
               <p>Though Mrs. Lee spoke English fluently for a foreigner, as she was totally unacquainted with New England domestic life, it was decided that I should become her Mentor for the next few months.</p> 
               <p>Although very happy in this new home, it was not till years after that I fully appreciated its privileges. Mrs. Lee evaded general society, but she soon became the centre of a choice circle. Those distinguished for learning and wisdom, wit and genius, gathered instinctively about her; but in the most brilliant assemblies, she shone the bright, particular star.</p> 
               <p>I was often surprised beyond measure at the variety of her acquirements, and the versatility of her talents. How much a true woman can influence the other sex! It was astonishing to see the change in some of our beaux in the lady's presence, and without the least apparent effort, she succeeded in awakening more than one from the lethargy of sin and folly, into which they were sinking, to incite them to the noble lives which they afterwards led.</p> 
               <p>Our country hare to thank the poor emigr for more than one of her renowned sons; for without her exertion, it is nearly certain that they would have sunk like too many of their giddy associates into early and unknown graves.</p> 
               <p>Dwight immediately became the lady's Mend and confidant. His law studies continued about as long as I had predicted.</p> 
               <p>He came one evening with the information that I was a regular sibyl. Law was the embodiment of the adage, "Set a rogue to catch a rogue." He was an honest fellow, and would have none of it.</p> 
               <p>"What will you do?" I anxiously queried.</p> 
               <p>"Trust to Providence, as Pearson did his old mare, when he turned her out with three feet of snow on the ground, and the thermometer below zero."</p> 
               <p>"Providence provided her with a frozen grave, I presume," returned Genevieve. "Is that the goal of your hopes?"</p> 
               <p>"By no means, madam. I intend to become a magnate in the land."</p> 
               <p>"Then you had better take a few lessons of Polly Brown," I interposed.</p> 
               <p>"True, Miss Wisdom; you were sent for my guardian angel."</p> 
               <p>"Take care, Jessie; your advice may be dangerous to yourself. But who is Polly Brown?" asked Genevieve.</p> 
               <p>Dwight and I rushed into an enthusiastic description of our friend.</p> 
               <p>"I must know this Miss Brown. Studying French by herself!" she exclaimed: "c'est impossible! She must come here, must she not, mon mari?"</p> 
               <p>Mon mari, without lowering his newspaper, answered: "Certainly, if it will give you and Jessie pleasure."</p> 
               <pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6399-00000070"/> 
               <p>Of course it would give us pleasure; but, remembering Polly's independent ideas, I explained that she must be invited as my friend; the plan for study would then be gradually developed.</p> 
               <p>"Oui, oui, je comprendre! The young lady is much to be honored. Dwight must take you to invite her to-morrow. I go to Boston next week with James. Miss Brown must keep you company during our absence."</p> 
               <p>This was a nice plan; surely, Polly could but accept the invitation.</p> 
               <p>According to the evening's arrangement, Dwight drove me to the parsonage the following afternoon, calling upon Polly by the way. As I had anticipated, my friend hesitated, exhibiting an emotion for which I could not account. This was quickly suppressed, and after much entreaty, she promised to be ready to return with us in the evening.</p> 
               <p>Genevieve's quiet reception placed Polly completely at ease; but there was a confusion and restraint on her meeting with James, at which I was exceedingly provoked. Why was it that Polly always appeared at disadvantage before my fastidious cousin?</p> 
               <p>It required some persuasion to keep Polly after Mr. and Mrs. Lee's return home, and, for a few days, she appeared ill at ease, but this soon wore away, and in a short time, Genevieve became a dear friend. The French lessons followed naturally; these were united with practice upon the piano and other accomplishments, which Polly had always desired, but never had expected to attain.</p> 
               <p>Though the intercourse between James and his guest was marked with the utmost politeness, there was little cordiality evinced.</p> 
               <p>I was exceedingly galled by my cousin's non-appreciation of his wife's protege, and one evening saucily inquired; "If he did not recognize that it was foreordained that he should marry a French woman for the coarse, red-handed Polly's special advancement?"</p> 
               <p>The hot blood rushed to his very crown: "Jessie!" he exclaimed, in such a tone that I shrank back utterly abashed.</p> 
               <p>Though Polly adhered to the resolution, not to allow pleasure to interfere with her studies, she agreed with Genevieve that a proper attention to society was requisite to the formation of an evenly balanced mind. The study of books was necessary, but the study of human nature not less so. The world had certain claims upon us which it was wrong to disregard. Consequently, much to my delight, my dear Polly became installed in the select coterie over which Mrs. Lee reigned, where her superiority immediately became recognized, eliciting great attention from both ladies and gentlemen.</p> 
               <p>Mira and 1 declared we must look to our laurels, as we were mere pigmies beside the magnificent Miss Brown, whom, without wounding her pride, Genevieve and I contrived to dress with that plain richness so appropriate for her face and figure.</p> 
               <p>Mira's spleen towards Ann Norton's admirers was mitigated at finding that they could pay sincere homage to her superb neighbor.</p> 
               <p>"The men are not so foolish after all," she exclaimed, much to our amusement, the morning after one of Polly's successful evenings. "The trouble is, they are too apt to take their tone from us women."</p> 
               <p>"Adam following Eve's lead. It is such an ancient institution, Mira, 1 do not see how it is to be remedied. Suppose you and Jessie get up a missionary society for the purpose," suggested Dwight, at the same time by an unlucky twirl, upsetting her work-basket.</p> 
                
               <p>"I think somebody had better get up something to keep you out of mischief."</p> 
               <p>"I have something, now," he jocosely replied, as he proceeded to gather up the scattered articles. "What is this?" he continued, as he took a small picture on ivory from the carpet.</p> 
               <p>"Don't break it, be careful! It is a Madonna, Genevieve has given me."</p> 
               <p>"A Dutch Madonna! That is something new! These Madonnas make me nervous! Mary was of pure Jewish descent, she ought to be represented with the characteristics of her beautiful countrywomen."</p> 
               <p>"A chaque saint sa chandelle."</p> 
               <p>We laughed at Genevieve's piquant repartee, but Dwight continued: "I saw a Jewish girl in New York last autumn whose face, slightly spiritualized, would make a perfect Madonna's."</p> 
               <p>"Paint it, mon ami. Paint it at once."</p> 
               <p>"Thanks, Madame; your behests shall be obeyed."</p> 
               <p>We gaily cautioned Genevieve against the abuse of such illimitable power.</p> 
               <p>In a few days, Dwight produced his picture, an exquisite thing on ivory. We were delighted, and good judges pronounced it a perfect gem.</p> 
               <p>Genevieve enthusiastically declared Dwight should become an artist. "Heaven designed you as such."</p> 
               <p>"True, lady, but Heaven's will is not yet exactly executed on earth, notwithstanding the daily petition from myriads of lips for the speedy annunciation of that millennial period,"</p> 
               <p>"Aide toi, et le cielt' aidera."</p> 
               <p>Dwight sighed.</p> 
               <p>I understood the trouble. His small partrimony was expended.</p> 
               <p>How could I help him? Starvation was not such a horror as indebtedness to me. Nothing galled him so much as the idea that the world might think he valued me the more for my fortune. A bright thought suggested itself.</p> 
               <p>I wished for a portrait of Aunt Compton. "Dwight must paint it." James added: "I would like Genevieve's and mine; you must paint those first, that is, if you will consider it a business transaction, and receive the usual remuneration."</p> 
               <p>Dwight, with a comical face replied, "That the laborer was worthy of his hire. Could they fit him up a studio in the third story?"</p> 
               <p>"Oui, certainment," replied Genevieve, springing up. "Come and make your choice of apartments." As we followed Genevieve's light feet, Dwight whispered, "Providence leads those that trust to its guidance; so don't look so distressed, Jessie."</p> 
               <p>Tears rushed to my eyes; it was difficult to murmur, "It is cruel in you not to share with me like a brother."</p> 
               <p>I was not prepared for the outburst that followed.</p> 
               <p>Oh, how I wished I was poor! a pauper even, rather than the distinguished heiress! Dwight ought not to be so proud, so independent I Did I think the less of him for this high spirit? No; far from it.</p> 
               <p>The studio was prepared the requisite materials procured, and Genevieve's portrait commenced. For the first time, Dwight worked steadily, almost too much so for health. James, with his usual kind forethought, insisted that he should take regular exercise, and placed Peacock at his service.</p> 
               <p>The paintings gave universal satisfaction; after James' had been completed, Uncle Rutledge must have hid whole family taken. Miss Betty Bradshaw came next; this was followed by a multiplicity of orders, I feared I should never get Aunt Compton's portrait, but Dwight assured me that it should be painted the next summer, in his annual visit to the master's.</p> 
               <pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6399-00000071"/> 
               <p>Spring and the birds had come. Fast was approaching. Polly and I had begun to think of home, when one noon, as James came to dinner, he handed Polly a note.</p> 
               <p>The young lady broke the seal without looking up; but I noticed my guardian's peculiar smile as she did so.</p> 
               <p>Polly glanced over the page, then turning as red as a peony, she rushed up stairs.</p> 
               <p>Dwight, who had become a member of the family, was descending, and he came to inquire "What had turned Polly into such a virago?"</p> 
               <p>I opined that it was a love letter. James laughed; Genevieve looked inquiringly at her husband.</p> 
               <p>The dinner bell sounded. We were seated ere Polly appeared. With her most regal air, she deposited a note beside her host's plate.</p> 
               <p>"I trust it is encouraging, Polly," said he, taking the billet.</p> 
               <p>Miss Polly shook her head.</p> 
               <p>"Polly, you mad thing," I screamed, "Surely you have not been so crazy as to reject the modern Demosthenes!" Dwight gazed earnestly into her face, and replied, "Yes, she has."</p> 
               <p>"Avez vous considrez? C'est un grand manage?" inquired Genevieve.</p> 
               <p>"Non, Madame, she has no consideration," replied the artist; turning to Polly, he added: "My dear, you need enlightenment! This lover is not to be set lightly aside! He has ancestors-a pedigree as long as the Mall! His first progenitor came into Eden with Adam, his next went out of the ark with Noah; the family were then traced in the Argonautic expedition. They were renowned among the Romans, thence passed into Gaul. The immediate forefather came in with William the Conqueror; since that period, they have figured as warriors and statesmen, priests, and poets. This illustrious suitor is descended from one of the best families in the 'Old Dominion'; his mother was a governor's daughter, his sister's husband is our present attorney-general; he has cousins in the army, navy, and learned professions; lastly, he is a tall, good-looking fellow, with more head than brains, but sense enough to duly appreciate Miss Polly Brown, of no family, nor estate, though I have heard it whispered, that the Browns came out of Eden with the Montgomeries."</p> 
               <p>"Are you through?" demanded Polly, as Dwight stopped. "Take a long breath, do, you must need it."</p> 
               <p>"Jacta est alea," said James, as he placed Polly's note in his pocket.</p> 
               <p>"L'amour et la fume ne peuvent sa cacher. I pity the squire's disappointment," said Genevieve.</p> 
               <p>"He loves his own donship too much to have many pangs," returned the stony Polly.</p> 
               <p>"That will only make it the harder. You will be obliged to have a personal explanation; he will never believe in this refusal till he hears it from your lips," I replied.</p> 
               <p>"Jessie is au fait in these matters. I suspect she is right, Polly," said James.</p> 
               <p>As I had predicted, in an hour after my guardian's departure, the gentleman arrived with a request for Miss Brown.</p> 
               <p>Poor Polly! I told her "she now had an inkling of what I was often called to endure. I had no pity for her, because, she had always affirmed women need not receive offers from those to whom they were averse, if they conducted with proper circumspection."</p> 
               <p>With a look of pitable entreaty, she left the room. At the end of an hour, the suitor departed, and Polly came up-stairs, pale and trembling.</p> 
               <p>"Jessie," she exclaimed, sinking into a chair, "I did not know this was so hard. To think that anybody should thus honor me! But I could not love him! We should both have been miserable, but I shall be blamed for this refusal."</p> 
               <p>"Does Mr. Montgomery blame you?"</p> 
               <p>"No, but the world will. My only hope is that the affair may be kept secret."</p> 
               <p>We all had the same desire, but somehow it crept out, spread abroad, and created due sensation, "What did the girl expect?" Her family were indignant, though proud of the honor.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Brown took her baby, and performed an amazing round of visiting-to descant upon "the splendid offer our Polly had rejected. Well, she would do it; nobody could control Polly; she wished Bethia had had such a chance, she guessed she'd had more sense."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXV.</head> 
               <head type="sub">DENTISTRY AS IT WAS.</head> 
               <p>UPON my return to the parsonage, I found that the parish were in a ferment respecting the meeting-house. The old structure upon the hill-top had long been out of repair; now Mr. Kirkwood urged the erection of a new house, The society agreed that it was needed, but it was not so easy to decide upon a location. Part very sensibly objected to climbing to the present site, while others would not hear of any innovation. There was about an equal division, and parish meeting followed parish meeting, while the matter was discussed in public and private by both men and women, with the zeal and prejudice usual upon like occasions.</p> 
               <p>Our gossips were in a fair way to obtain an overplus of subjects to descant upon at their afternoon tea-drinkings. Scarcely had the sensation respecting Polly's refusal subsided, ere it was rumored that Ann Norton, during her visit to Haverhill, had secured a rich Boston merchant. This report was confirmed soon after Ann's return, in May, by the appearance of the gentleman, who caused a general excitement, as he drove to the 'Squire's in a coach and four, with coachman and valet in livery. This favored lover was a tall, dark man of forty-five, a widower without children. John Knight had been right. Ann must be marrying for wealth and position! Every one was unanimous in this opinion. As hints prejudicial to Mr. Nugent's character were whispered through our circle, most of us were disposed to look with pity upon the bride elect, but it was evident she did not consider herself an object for commiseration. Mrs. Norton was quite angry with Aunt Compton for expressing a doubt of her daughter's happiness. "It was all envy, nothing but envy. Did she s'pose Mrs. White, the very tiptop of Haverhill ton, would have encouraged his suit if Mr. Nugent had been what people said? Why, his house was a palace, and he worshipped his late wife, and went even so far as to procure a marble-topped table to put her coffin on at the funeral! She always thought Ann would do well when she settled, but she had never looked for such a match as this." In vain Aunt Compton expatiated upon the vanity of all external splendor as a means of happiness in matrimonial life." She might have spared her breath, as Peggy averred. "La, sakes, madam," said she, when Mrs. Norton had taken leave, "What's the use talking? Why, you couldn't touch any of the family with a sixty-foot polo; and as to the 'Squire, I hope he won't burst, but raly I'm afeard he'll want hooping."</p> 
               <p>The week following Mr. Nugent's first visit, Ann paid me a confidential call. After relating all the pro's and con's of her engagement, she implored<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6399-00000072"/> that by-gones should be by-gones, and that I would forgive the trick she played with the miniature.</p> 
               <p>"I had an object in doing as I did. I cannot explain now, but really, Jessie, I did not mean to plague you beyond a joke"</p> 
               <p>I bit my lips but said nothing.</p> 
               <p>"You must forgive me, and be my first bridesmaid. I shall ask Mira to stand second. Now don't refuse; our rivalry has ceased; let us be friends."</p> 
               <p>I felt that Ann spoke truly, and not to be outdone in magnanimity, gave the desired promise.</p> 
               <p>The wedding was to take place the first of September. After some demur, Mira yielded to my solicitation, and consented to join me in officiating upon the occasion.</p> 
               <p>It was near the close of a sultry August evening. Ann and I had just returned from town, whither we had gone in the morning, to superintend the making of our dresses for the wedding. It had been a tiresome day, and my head was aching intensely. As I sat in the cool kitchen, sipping the nice cup of tea Peggy had prepared, I congratulated myself that my day's labors were over, and that I could immediately seek "nature's sweet restorer." I had not quite drained my second cup, when Dwight, who was boarding at the "master's" while lie painted the Donaldsons' portraits, entered with the information that Aunt Susy, who, a few days previous had been taken with one of her frequent ill turns, could not procure a watcher, and had sent for me.</p> 
               <p>"She can't go; she needs a watcher herself as much as Susy Neal," up spoke Peggy.</p> 
               <p>"I rather think you are right, Peggy," replied Dwight. "Aunt Susy is feeble, and no wonder, with the little air and exercise she has; but she does not need a watcher. I will tell them you are too tired to come, Jessie, and one of the old maids can sit up if Susy insists upon having some one with her."</p> 
               <p>I knew that Aunt Susy would take my refusal in high dudgeon. Nothing put her out more than any insinuation that she was not in a most dangerous state, requiring constant care. I therefore told Dwight to stop a few moments, then I should be ready to accompany him. Aunt Compton thought I had better go if I felt able; so, much to Peggy's chagrin, I set forth.</p> 
               <p>All but Aunt Judy were in bed when I entered. The windows had been some time shut, and the kitchen felt close, but Aunt Susy's room was like an oven. "Susy will have a leetle fire every night to keep off the damp," said Aunt Judy, as she threw a few dry alders on the bed of coals in the small fireplace. "You must keep her abb tea hot; she wants it most scalding, and I guess that's all you'11 have to do. Here is some tea, and dropkin cakes; I '11 put the kettle in the corner."</p> 
               <p>Oh, dear, must I stay in that suffocating atmosphere all night? "What could not be cured, must be endured," so I put as good a face on the matter as possible, and replied to all Aunt Judy's inquiries respecting Ann's bridal preparations. The sick woman revived wonderfully during my recital, and after Aunt Judy had bidden us good night, fell into a sound sleep. I ventured to open the door into the kitchen, and as the fire had nearly burnt qut, I managed to get through a couple of hours, though my temples throbbed, and my head felt ready to burst. About eleven, Aunt Susy awoke, and requested some Mayweed tea. I poured a draught from the brown mug that stood on the embers, and handed it to her.</p> 
               <p>The cup was instantly returned, with an exclamation of disgust; "It is not half hot enough; build up the fire and heat it; I want it boiling, Jessie."</p> 
               <p>I obeyed directions, but by the time I had succeeded in bringing the liquid to the required heat, the invalid was snoring. What must I do? Keep up that fire so that the tea should be ready against her awaking? I saw no other way. I sweltered through another hour, then the tea was demanded. That time it was just right, and I received due praise.</p> 
               <p>"You are the best watcher I have had this summer," said Aunt Susy, rising in bed. "Now put the pillows to my back, and that blanket over my shoulders, and I'11 smoke. My stomach gets cold and windy, and smoking carries it off. You will see the pipe and tobacco on the mantle shelf. There 'tis, next the cupboard, fill it full and light it for me."</p> 
               <p>"I will hand you the candle, and you can light it yourself, Aunt Susy," I replied, aghast at her proposal.</p> 
               <p>"No," said she, "I don't relish it lighted with taller. It must be lit with a coal. You can do it, only draw a whiff or two, 't wont hurt ye. It's hulsome."</p> 
               <p>Gracious, what would come next? It was useless to object; so I lighted the pipe and gave it to Aunt Susy, who declared it was the nicest pipe she'd smoked since she was sick.</p> 
               <p>By the time she was asleep again, it was impossible for me to stay in the room. I accordingly stole into the kitchen, and having softly raised a window an inch or so, I sat down to inhale the refreshing breeze. Unconsciously, my head fell upon the table before me, and I sank into a deep sleep.</p> 
               <p>Dawn was breaking when I awoke. For an instant, I could not recall where I was, then the recreancy to my trust rushed to mind. I started up in affright. My limbs were cramped, and a tooth that had been troublesome was aching badly. Had Aunt Susy waked during my nap! I trusted not. The fire was out, the herb tea cold; my delinquency would be discovered unless I could right matters.</p> 
               <p>I raked open the ashes on the kitchen hearth, hoping to find a few embers, but none were there. Gathering some kindlings, I esssayed to strike fire, but the tinder-box was nearly empty, and though flint and steel were plied vigorously, I could not light a match.</p> 
               <p>At that moment, Dwight's footstep was heard above; in an instant, he entered the room.</p> 
               <p>"Good morning, Miss Wisdom; how does your ladyship find yourself? I have not slept half a wink, from sympathy in this irksome, unnecessary vigil."</p> 
               <p>Dwight's cheery tones brought new life. He laughed heartily as I related the night's experience.</p> 
               <p>"I wish I could have peeped when you were lighting that pipe, but it is a shame! Poor girl, how pale you look. Give me the tinder-box;"</p> 
               <p>I told him there was not sufficient tinder to catch, as I complied.</p> 
               <p>"Put on some of that dry brush. I will manage," he replied, as he took the King's arm from the brackets above the mantle. Pouring some powder into the pan, he laid it across the andirons. "Push the chips up to the lock, Jessie, and step this way. I have lighted the fire so, many times. Aunt Judy is forever out of tinder."</p> 
               <p>"Isn 't the gun loaded?</p> 
               <p>"No; I fired it off last night," returned the young man, as he pulled the trigger. Bang went old King, with a report that shook the house to its foundation, while bricks and mortar flew about our heads. Dwight shouted, I screamed, Aunt Susy screeched, the master ran from his room, in robe de nuit, bump, bump, came the sisters, springing from bed above.</p> 
               <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6399-00000073"/> 
               <p>"What had happened? was there an airthquake?"</p> 
               <p>The confusion was indescribable. We had much ado to explain, and tranquillize the invalid. A hearty laugh ensued; the master, it appeared, had reloaded the gun without Dwight's knowledge. The bricks having been cleared away, everything in its usual trim, I bade good morning. Aunt Susy paid many encomiums upon my good nursing, declared I had been the best watcher she'd had.</p> 
               <p>Much relieved, I sought my chamber; I had thought the toothache scared away, but it returned with tenfold intensity.</p> 
               <p>Peggy prescribed and poulticed, but in vain. Jump, jump, twinge, twinge, it became unendurable. After twenty-four hours of misery, I decided that it must be extracted. Dwight said he would take me to Dr. Evans.</p> 
               <p>The doctor, had gone to the pasture for his horse; we were obliged to wait some time, but my molar continued as painful as before.</p> 
               <p>"Ho, ho! that row of ivory to be broken. Don't the sight of the doctor scare away the pain?" inquired the kind physician, in his hearty, friendly way.</p> 
               <p>"No, it must come out."</p> 
               <p>"So, so! Pity, pity, Pet!" muttered the good man, as he wound the instrument with his handkerchief.</p> 
               <p>"Now, young man, take her head between your hands,-so-steady, mind."</p> 
               <p>Dwight obeyed, but he turned deadly pale; the doctor saw the change. Turning, he hastily demanded, "Can you go through this job?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes. Don't linger. How I wish I could bear it for you, Jessie," he whispered, as the doctor advanced. The gum having been separated, the iron was screwed on. I clenched the chair with strong determination-a terrible wrench-off came the instrument,-it was too large. More handkerchief having been supplied, there came a firmer gripe. Twist, crash-a jar that vibrated in every nerve, while sparks flashed from my closed eyes-the tooth was broken even with the gum.</p> 
               <p>"What was to be done?"</p> 
               <p>"The roots must be taken out."</p> 
               <p>"Could he do it?"</p> 
               <p>"Certainly; I must be patient."</p> 
               <p>Opening my mouth still wider, as directed, I leaned back upon Dwight's breast, and prepared for the worst. The pain from the broken tooth was so excruciating, I felt that almost any change would be relief.</p> 
               <p>The clumsy, good-natured old doctor set to work, jam, punchy push, bore; bore, jam, push, punch! Human nature has limits; notwithstanding my determination of endurance, it became wholly unendurable. With a faint cry, I sank back, almost insensible.</p> 
               <p>Restoratives were quickly applied, As I revived, the physician wished to resume his labor, but Dwight forbade him.</p> 
               <p>"No, no! Jessie cannot bear anything more to-day."</p> 
               <p>The doctor looked irresolute. "I am afraid those roots will be very painful."</p> 
               <p>"Probably. Mrs. Evans will you be to kind as to hand me Jessie's bonnet?"</p> 
               <p>I had long known that when Dwight chose to command, no one ever thought of resisting. I was carefully lifted into the chaise, but we were obliged to return at a slow walk, as the slightest jar was torture.</p> 
               <p>For more than a week, I suffered Intensely. It was impossible to lie down, and the nourishment I was able to receive was swallowed with much difficulty.</p> 
               <p>My friends were greatly concerned, and good Dr. Evans was truly distressed tressed. "He did what he thought would be best,-I was so delicate, so delicate!"</p> 
               <p>Dwight proved one of the tenderest of nurses; his services were invaluable during my helpless state.</p> 
               <p>"That is a most winning young man," said Aunt Compton, as he rode away the first morning of my convalescence. "The most interesting I ever met; he has such a mixture of womanly gentleness and manly force."</p> 
               <p>"Is he equal to my Uncle Compton? "I archly inquired.</p> 
               <p>"I never think of comparing any one to him, Jessie."</p> 
               <p>"What a fine thing it must be to fall in love,-one for a time, possesses such a hero. I wonder if it would be possible for me to be thus enhanced!"</p> 
               <p>My aunt looked up in her sad, quiet, way: "Your time will come soon enough, my darling."</p> 
               <p>Our conversation was interrupted by the entrance of the bride elect.</p> 
               <p>Ann expressed pleasure at my amendment: "I saw that Dwight's face was returning to its usual cheerfulness, as I met him this morning, so concluded that you was improving. His face has been a pretty true index of your state. You don't love him half enough, but I shan't quarrel with you for it, Jessie, because I have set my heart upon your captivating Mr. Raymond, my first man."</p> 
               <p>"Who is he?"</p> 
               <p>"I can't exactly say. Mrs. White told me his history was exceedingly romantic. His mother made a misalliance, and his youth was one of privation and sorrow. Mr. Nugent knew him when he was a poor cabin boy; but in a few years, he acquired the command of a ship. Upon his return from his first voyage, he found that he had inherited an immense fortune, left by a maternal uncle that had disinherited and disowned his mother, who had long been dead. There had been some love affair when he was only second mate between himself and a lady passenger, high in wealth and position. Her parents interfered, and the poor girl was hurried into a marriage with another. This has cast a gloom over the gentleman. He is the most splendid misanthrope and a perfect Encyclopedia. He has been everywhere, knows everything. I am determined that you shall be his second love, and that is the strongest, you know, according to Sir Walter Scott."</p> 
               <p>"Did you find that out by yourself, Ann?" I Mischievously asked. "Why didn't you secure this Mr. Raymond?"</p> 
               <p>"Wouldn't I if I could? But I ant not his sort! He loves beauty, but, somehow, I could never touch him. I can't explain, but I know I did not possess the master key to his heart. You may, and it would be so delightful to have you for a neighbor,"</p> 
               <p>I laughed, and told Ann that I knew she must have some interested motive.</p> 
               <p>Playfully bidding me "get well, and look my prettiest," the beautiful Ann took her leave. Notwithstanding every effort, my features were far from symmetrical when the nuptial day arrived.</p> 
               <p>Mira came to the parsonage to dress. I could not prevent a slight twinge of envy, as I contrasted her blooming beauty with my wan looks.</p> 
               <p>With a sigh, dismissed the idea of attracting the elegant stranger who was to share my part in the ceremony. Ann's recital had taken a strange hold of my imagination. I had thought of it much more than I Should like to have acknowledged.</p> 
               <p>But when I beheld Ann, I felt that discontent availed nothing. It mattered little respecting the adjuncts; no one could have eyes for anything but the exquisite bride.</p> 
               <p>Dwight's assistance had been evoked<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6399-00000074"/> to arrange the bridal veil and orange blossoms. When the pendent sprays and misty folds were in place, the gossamer floating gracefully over the glistening sheen, the young man stepped back to examine his work. First, the eyes glittered with artistic satisfaction, but gradually they grew grave, almost sad. "Ann," at length he exclaimed, in a serious, entreating tone, "You are going into the great world of fashion with a wonderful wealth of beauty. It is a God-given gift, never abuse it, but attune your spirit into perfect concord."</p> 
               <p>The unusually solemn adjuration struck us all. Ann turned pale and trembled, while her mother declared "People needn't fear for a girl that had had such a pious bringing up as her Ann."</p> 
               <p>Mr. Nugent had been in the country some days: other members of his family and Mr. Raymond arrived in a few moments.</p> 
               <p>As the carriage stopped, a dapper little man and two ladies alighted; these were followed by a tall gentleman from thirty-five to forty, with a pale, clear complexion, dark eyes and hair, and a most distinguished bearing.</p> 
               <p>This was Mr. Raymond; the others were a sister of Mr. Nugent, her husband and daughter.</p> 
               <p>As Mr. Raymond ascended the portico, he glanced up, and recognizing Ann, who was standing with us at her chamber window, bowed. His manner was perfect, but not a muscle of the face changed.</p> 
               <p>"I don't think so much of your famous Mr. Raymond," said Mira. "Jessie is welcome to him! He looks decidedly cross, and doubtless considers this whole affair an insufferable bore, and wishes us all in Jericho. I cannot abide these self-absorbed people, they are the personifications of selfishness."</p> 
               <p>Discontent was certainly legible on the gentleman's face. He went through the form of introduction with frigid grace. Suave and taciturn, his part was performed with that manly elegance that always commands admiration. Though thus cold and reserved, ah intangible something insensibly attracted one, and his voice possessed that rich melodious force so rare yet pleasing, and his transient fitful smile had a peculiar fascination.</p> 
               <p>I had been assisting Mrs. Norton to dress; Mira, Dwight, and William Norton (who was to be second groomsman) were cutting the cake.</p> 
               <p>As I was returning to the apartment assigned to the bridal group while awaiting the ceremony, Mr. Raymond's musical voice arrested me. With my hand on the lock, I heard him say: "Fortune is not as partial as most suppose. I never saw a pretty heiress."</p> 
               <p>"Jessie is much admired," returned Ann's birdlike tones; "but she has not recovered from a painful operation upon a tooth. Her eyes are fine, and she is exceedingly intellectual."</p> 
               <p>"Black eyes were never designed for women, and blue-stockings are detestable. That other girl is a perfect Juno; you ought to have placed me with her."</p> 
               <p>Indeed, sir; that is your opinion, is it? thought I, as, after waiting a moment, that they might hot have a suspicion that I had been listening, I entered the room.</p> 
               <p>Something of pique was, I suppose, legible in my face, for as I advanced, Mr. Raymond glanced up, then rose and deferentially handed me his chair.</p> 
               <p>It was declined, while I passed to the table and drew on my gloves. I was not disposed to burn incense at his shrine, and meant the gentleman should recognize that fact.</p> 
               <p>Accustomed to constant adulation, this conduct effected just the contrary from what I had intended. I saw that if I had been the most consummate coquette, I could not have manuvred better. Though Mr. Raymond scarcely addressed me through the evening, I instinctively knew that he was furtively watching every word and gesture.</p> 
               <p>"A detestable, black-eyed blue-stocking!" How the words rang in my ears! Could I reverse this decision? My fluttering heart said, Yes. He was attracted. I knew it as surely as though it had been acknowledged. Yes, I could handle the master-key! I could unlock that proud, sealed heart! Previously, I had carefully abstained from the first approach to coquetry, but that night I deliberately planned the subjugation of this arrogant, moody man.</p> 
               <p>What was to become of my heart meantime? I never dreamed of asking myself the question; was I not to remain forever in "maiden meditation, fancy free?"</p> 
               <p>The wedding passed as such things usually do. There was the usual quantity of tears and merriment.</p> 
               <p>The bridal party set forth on the ensuing morning. It had been arranged that Mira and I should visit Ann the next winter. Mr. Raymond shook Mira's hand at parting, and expressed the pleasure he should feel at again meeting her. I was bidden a simple good morning, accompanied by a most courtly cong, but as the coach whirled away, I was conscious of receiving his last glance.</p>

            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head> 
               <head type="sub">GENEVIEVE.</head> 
               <p>BUSINESS often called James from home, but Mira and I never permitted Genevieve to remain alone; we were only too glad to find a pretext for a visit; her companionship had become one of the necessities of our lives.</p> 
               <p>The week after the wedding, I was summoned to town. Mr. Lee was to be absent several days.</p> 
               <p>The parlor was empty. The housemaid said I should find Mrs. Lee up stairs.</p> 
               <p>I ascended to her chamber; as no one was there, I passed into a small dressing-room beyond. What was my surprise to find it fitted up with a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">prie-dieu,</foreign> upon which rested a Catholic prayer book, and a Douay version of the Scriptures. A small miniature lay upon the open prayer book, the likeness of a young man, with a handsome, but exceedingly sad face; one of those countenances that enchain the sight, and once seen can never be forgotten; one that will rise unbidden before the mind's eye, at the most unexpected times and places, a perfect haunting remembrance. Wholly absorbed, I was not conscious of Genevieve's entrance till stretching forth her hand, gently withdrawing the picture, in a voice which vainly strove for gayety, she demanded, "Who gave you a right to inspect my treasures?"</p> 
               <p>I saw her pale cheek, and the effort with which these words were spoken; it was no time for trifling; I therefore gravely replied, "I was very rude, but it was a sin of inadvertence; please forgive me."</p> 
               <p>She smiled faintly. "It is not quite the unpardonable sin <foreign xml:lang="FRA">la belle reine,</foreign> but I trust that your Puritanism has received a suitable shock. You are not bigoted, so will not condemn me unheard. I have learned that neither in this mountain nor at Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship; That the true worshipper must worship the Father in spirit. When I married, I determined that my husband's people should be my people; his God my God. It is so; but here are the relics<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6399-00000075"/> of past days; with my husband's concurrence, I have arranged them for convenience in my private devotions. I find that it conduces to my soul's peace to read the pages I first spelled at my mother's knee, to repeat the petitions I there first lisped."</p> 
               <p>"It is very proper, but as every one would not join in this opinion, I shall never mention the fact. You had better place these books under lock and key when they are not in use."</p> 
               <p>"You are kindness embodied, dear Jessie; you shall have your reward," and she again placed the miniature in my hand.</p> 
               <p>I took a long, lingering look. What was the charm that thus riveted my gaze? Genevieve, have I ever seen this face? it seems strangely familiar; who was he?"</p> 
               <p>She turned deadly pale, but after a pause, murmured, "My father's ward, the playmate of my childhood, the lover of my girlhood." Grasping my arm, she whispered, "Jessie, I stood by and saw his head severed, saw him die on the horrid guillotine!" I shuddered, and threw my arms about her with a burst of emotion. We sank upon the sofa and for a time mingled our tears.</p> 
               <p>My companion was the first to recover. "Dear Jessie, your sympathy is priceless," said she; "I am not half as content as I ought to be, with such friends as the Lord has raised up for me."</p> 
               <p>Intimate as we had become, Genevieve had never before alluded to the terrible scenes through which she had passed. James had given us to understand that they had been a perfect vortex of horrors, and had requested that no reference might ever be made to them. Now, however, as I again glanced to that bewitching likeness, I could not forbear whispering, as I raised my eyes to those of my companion, "Oh, how came you to see it?"</p> 
               <p>"I will try to tell you, Jessie. I have wished to speak of these things before, but could never gain courage. I have described my happy childhood, my brother and sister and their early death, though I never mentioned Henri. I have also said that my mother was an invalid! We left the Chateau and came to our hotel in Paris the autumn preceding my sixteenth birthday. This was done from the twofold motive of giving my mother medical advice, and introducing me to the world. Little did we think what awaited us! The troubles that had been so long pending, began to assume a more threatening aspect. My mother grew worse, and I passed a most anxious winter. Every day the clouds grew thicker, both in the political and domestic spheres. My sister had died the year previous. I strove to fill her place in my mother's sick room, but she pined for Adelaide. It was a dark, anxious time! You are acquainted with the events of the Devolution. Some other day, when I am calmer, I will go more into detail; now, a sketch must satisfy you. That terrible night the bastile was destroyed. Amidst the confusion, we got out of Paris, and in a few days, by traversing by-roads, arrived at our beautiful country home. Here my mother languished through those fearful months that preceded the execution of the Royal family. For weeks after the death of the king, she laid without sense or motion; but, just before death, consciousness returned, and she besought my father and lover, as soon as she was interred, to take me, with what property they could collect, and flee to England or America. She died in a few hours, and in a few weeks, we proceeded to put her desire into execution. We returned to Paris in disguise, and lodged in a mean quarter, with an old servant of the family. Oh, Jessie, yon can have no conception of the horrors of that fearful epoch. France was panic struck. Paris flowed with blood. The highest, best, and loveliest, perished daily upon the scaffold. Henri de Conti was young; he had never mingled in public affairs, was but little known out of our immediate circle.</p> 
               <p>"Never in his whole life had he done aught that could injure a single individual. He saw the many evils under which the country had long groaned, and wished for their abolition. Like my father, at heart he was a republican. A limited monarchy, like that of England, they had always advocated, but both had been too much occupied with their own affairs to meddle with politics.</p> 
               <p>"The accidental death of my brother three years before, and Adelaide's illness and death, had kept both from general society. Young, beautiful, good, a true patriot, and a true christian, Henri was seized by the rabble, who had penetrated his disguise, upon the single plea that he was rich and noble. After one of their mock trials, he was condemned to death. The faithful retainers, with whom we lodged, obtained this intelligence. The next morning my Henri was to die! That night, my father had the first stroke of paralysis. How did I ever survive the hours? I must see my beloved once more. Upon that I was determined! The good Joan wrapped me in her cloak, drew a black hood over my face and led me-for I was as one in a fearful nightmare-to the fatal spot. I was to have one glance, then turn away in silence. Everything depended upon silence. Not only my father's life, but those of the good people who had befriended us.</p> 
               <p>"We pushed through the crowd, close to the fatal platform. A tumbrel, crowded with noble forms drove up. My Henri was the first to step forth. Oh, how glorious he was! My saint! my angel! I could not turn; my eyes were riveted as by a charm. In vain Joan strove to pull me away. I saw it all,-the whole preparation-then the bright steel flashed, the guillotine descended, and my Henri was in Paradise-in Paradise-yes, he was there,-but, ah me, I was on earth! Gladly would I have rushed up those steps, and laid my head upon the block wet with his blood. My father! I must live for my father! You will scarcely credit it, Jessie, but I had gone to the scaffold a timid, shrinking, heart-broken girl. I came from it the calm, self-relying woman. Every motion was checked, my whole nature was benumbed. It seemed as though years had intervened in those few moments. I was young and fair when I went out; I was old and haggard when I came in. Even my father did not at first recognize me.</p> 
               <p>"In a short time we fled to Calais, thence after much difficulty, proceeded to England. After a short sojourn in that country we took passage for the United States.</p> 
               <p>"My father was ill through the long tempestuous voyage, but after our arrival in New York, he began to rally, and in a short time, was able to go out, and in some measure, resume his usual mode of life. As he grew better, I began to sink.</p> 
               <p>"Excitement had sustained me thus far; now that the goal had been attained, and I found myself comparatively at peace in a quiet lodging, mind and body both gave way. For nearly a year I was confined to the bed, and another passed ere I could leave my room. The first thing that roused me from the lethargy into which I had fallen, was the discovery that our finances were nearly exhausted. My father had found friends, and he obtained employment in the counting-room of an eminent merchant. Should I permit my feeble parent to toil, while<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6399-00000076"/> I lived in idleness? No, indeed! I forced back sad recollections, and determined to live only in the present. I took more nourishment and exercise, and enlivened the weary hours by the use of my needle and pencil. By these means, and the blessing of heaven, my health returned. And by the sale of the embroidery and paintings, I was enabled to add materially to our scanty income. Time passed, and I had attained a degree of cheerfulness that once I could never have deemed possible (but time and the steady performance of duty are great consolers), when my father was again attacked by paralysis. His mind was weakened, and his limbs and speech affected by the stroke. For a while I toiled on, but I found it was impossible to obtain a livelihood by the sale of my fancy-work. After mature deliberation, I determined to offer myself as a French teacher. During our sojourn in New York, I had led a completely secluded life; my father's mercantile friend and my physician were my only male acquaintances. To these, however, I determined to apply for advice and assistance. I was received with the greatest kindness, and a situation in an academy in Philadelphia was procured. Upon the first day of our arrival in that city, as I was supporting my decrepit parent to the dining-room of the hotel, where we had stopped for a few days while more private lodgings could be procured, a gentleman stepped forward, and, with the most winning address, offered his arm to my father. The poor old man, bewildered by the scene, upon thus hearing his native tongue, imagined himself again in his Parisian home. His language was too much for me; schooled as I had become. I was completely overpowered. The gentleman, without appearing to notice my emotion, paid us the most delicate attention during the meal, and at its close, conducted my father to his chamber. That night came the last fatal shock. About ten o'clock, my father's broken tones summoned me to his bedside. I saw what was coming; the remedies were at hand; I gave them instantly, and a physician was summoned, but every effort proved vain. He lingered only a few hours. I wish I could describe the sweet serenity the departing spirit left upon the worn face. Death has a beauty as well as life! My seclusion had rendered me wholly unacquainted with the customs of my adopted country. I was a stranger in a strange land, alone with my dead. What was I to do?</p> 
               <p>"'Leave everything to me,' said the voice of the kind stranger, who, at the first alarm, had hastened to the bedside of the dying man. You can imagine what followed, but I have never been able to conceive how James came to love me. Pity is akin to love, and pity was the foundation of his esteem. For a time, I would not believe his emotions amounted to anything stronger. I besought him to leave me, to test his heart by absence. I told him my whole story, assured him that I could not love as he deserved to be loved; it was of no use; if I did not positively dislike him, if I should not be unhappy with him, I must become his wife.</p> 
               <p>"What could I do? He had made himself my whole world, the one only tie that bound me to life. At length I reluctantly acceded to his wishes.</p> 
               <p>"I felt that my husband's family must look upon me as an artful adventuress. I was prepared for suspicious coldness, but not for the kind, the affectionate reception I met. God alone knows my gratitude; I have tried to manifest it, but words will always prove wholly inadequate; there are feelings altogether too profound for speech."</p> 
               <p>I tenderly embraced my cousin, with assurances that the gain had been mostly ours; that she was beloved as truly as she loved.</p> 
               <p>The following Christmas, Mira and I paid our contemplated visit to the bride. We found Mrs. Nugent established in a fine house in an aristocratic quarter of the city. The mansion, a square, three-storied, brick structure, with stone portico and copings, stood in the midst of a spacious court, with a circular approach through an arched gate, surmounted by a glass oil lantern, which was lighted every evening. In the rear were stable, coach house, etc.</p> 
               <p>The interior matched the exterior in splendor; the furniture had recently been imported from France, and the extent of the spacious drawing-room was magnified by the insertion of mirrors into the door-panels; the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tout ensemble</foreign> being magnificent. The pink, silk curtains of our bed were also gathered about an oval glass, in the centre of the canopy. This novelty greatly amused Mira, who declared we must lie awake nights to see how we looked asleep.</p> 
               <p>The whole house was one glittering show. I should have pined for a more homely retreat, but Ann was perfectly satisfied. She had lost the animation summoned during her belleship, and had relaxed into her old listlessness and indolence; living upon the maxim that anything was good enough for one's husband, and dressing alone for company, in which she seldom strove to exert herself, unless excited by the presence of Mr. Knight,-who was now a resident in Boston,-or of some other gallant.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THEATRICALS.</head> 
               <p>THE first of January, Mrs. Norton and Miss Kate Donaldson arrived at Mr. Nugent's. The New Year was ushered in with great festivity. Everywhere I met Mr. Raymond, and everywhere I saw him courted as "a bright, particular star" Upon our arrival, he had expressed pleasure at again meeting Mira; I received only a ceremonious salutation. Although he still maintained his courtly reserve, I knew by the furtive glances that I often encountered, that I was far from being unheeded. Meanwhile, I was silently studying his character. Why did this cynical, self-absorbed man so charm the other sex. I soon learned that, like myself, he would have replied that his chief attraction was his wealth; but all women are not fortune-hunters! There must be some other cause! The most common-place female possesses a spice of romance; to this, I traced the universal interest shown to one whose youth was shrouded in a mysterious poverty, and whose manhood, it was believed, had been darkened by disappointment. Besides, I was compelled to own that, if he saw fit, the gentleman could render himself remarkably entertaining. His conversational powers were of a high order; his knowledge both of men and books was extensive; when he deigned to speak, it was always to the purpose, while his transient, fleeting smile was irresistible.</p> 
               <p>One evening in the second week of my visit, Mrs. Norton, Ann, Miss Kate, Mira, Dwight and myself had drawn our chairs round the parlor fire. The twilight was fast deepening into night, but the blazing hickory logs irradiated the large room with a cheerful glow. It was just the hour for social chat. We had been discussing various matters, when Miss Kate suddenly exclaimed: "What have you done to Mr. Raymond, Jessie? He watches you as closely as a cat does a mouse, and is as deferential as though you were the queen."</p> 
               <pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6399-00000077"/> 
               <p>We all laughed, and Dwight replied: "She fails to minister to his conceit. He cannot forgive her for showing him that he is no more than any other gilded man."</p> 
               <p>"You are too hard upon Mr. Raymond. He is more than a gilded man," said Mira.</p> 
               <p>"Yes; you ladies universally pronounce him interesting," Dwight replied, "but probe this influence, and what do you find? Nothing save a morbid unrest and selfish repining. What right has he, or any one, to enshroud himself in a winding sheet of sorrow, and go through the world proclaiming 'woe, woe'? Does this man think that his is the only heart that holds a charnel-house of buried hopes?"</p> 
               <p>"Every one is not born with your sunny disposition, Dwight," said Mrs. Norton.</p> 
               <p>"Every one can mould his disposition, learn to overcome the world, and be of good cheer."</p> 
               <p>There was a pause, which was broken by the entrance of our host and Mr. Raymond.</p> 
               <p>"What, in the dark!" exclaimed the former. "Ann, ring for lights. Girls, I have hit upon a delightful scheme. Raymond and I have been talking over some private theatricals we once assisted to get up in England, and I have determined to have them repeated here; we can turn the upper loft into a theatre, and you must all take parts. The play will be Romeo and Juliet. Raymond can perform Romeo more than creditably; we will end the festivities by a supper and ball."</p> 
               <p>Mr. Nugent lived entirely for present enjoyment, and he was enthusiastic at the prospect of this novelty. Ann yawned, and inquired "If it would not be a great fuss?"</p> 
               <p>"I could have sworn that would be your first thought," returned her husband, with a poorly disguised sneer. Mrs. Norton did not increase his good humor by her queries respecting the propriety of the matter. "Do you think Madam Compton would approve of your taking a part, Jessie?"</p> 
               <p>"Why not? Is it not as innocent to act Shakspeare as to read it?"</p> 
               <p>Mr. Raymond suddenly raised his eyes to mine with a glance that I did not exactly fathom.</p> 
               <p>"My mother is a church member, but she goes to the theatre," said Mira. "Everybody knows you are wicked enough, Mr. Nugent; we can lay our sins on your shoulders if fault is found."</p> 
               <p>We all laughed at the saucy girl.</p> 
               <p>"What do you say to the project, Sprague?" inquired Mr. Raymond.</p> 
               <p>"That it will make no small stir amongst those that term themselves godly."</p> 
               <p>"We happily have only two of that stamp here," sneered Mr. Nugent. "You have not spoken, Miss Kate, but I take it for granted that we may count upon your assistance."</p> 
               <p>"Certainly; Shakspeare and the drama are my adoration."</p> 
               <p>"The scenery can be procured at the Old Federal," proceeded Mr. Nugent. "Sprague, I shall expect your assistance about the fixtures. Raymond will enact Romeo; you must take Mercutio."</p> 
               <p>"Capital!" exclaimed Miss Kate. "We have a natural born Mercutio; the play must succeed."</p> 
               <p>"Who is to be Juliet,-Mrs. Nugent?" asked Mr. Raymond.</p> 
               <p>"No, indeed; I disapprove the whole affair," replied the lady.</p> 
               <p>"What a fair saint," her husband sarcastically, interposed.</p> 
               <p>"Who is to be Juliet?" queried Miss Kate.</p> 
               <p>"Miss Rutledge," suggested Mr. Raymond, as he took out his note-book.</p> 
                
               <p>"No, Jessie," replied my cousin. "She is the greatest actress that ever trod boards."</p> 
               <p>Biting his pencil, the gentleman slowly returned, "You would look the character best, Miss Rutledge. As some other of Shakspeare's heroines, Miss Bradshaw must excel; but I think you would best represent the impassioned daughter of Italy."</p> 
               <p>He did not consider me sufficiently beautiful for. Juliet! Somewhat nettled, I quickly replied, "That if the unimpressible Mr. Raymond could play Romeo, I doubted not that I could perform the impassioned Juliet."</p> 
               <p>A smile passed round the circle, while Mr. Nugent cried "Ah, Raymond, for once you have met your peer."</p> 
               <p>Mr. Raymond lifted Ms eyes, and with one of his quick, searching glances, murmured in a tone meant only for my ear, "Perhaps neither would be a great anomaly. The swift currents of the heart lie hidden the deepest."</p> 
               <p>"We are all acquainted with Jessie's dramatic talent; she must be Juliet, Mr. Raymond," said Miss Kate, "I will take the part of Lady Capulet."</p> 
               <p>"Good, thank you," said Mr. Nugent. "Dwight, do you think the Misses Sprague would lend their aid?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, and Lucretia's lover, Mr. Mason, is in the city."</p> 
               <p>"Then he and Knight and Pendleton will complete the role."</p> 
               <p>"You have forgotten the apothecary," said Miss Kate.</p> 
               <p>"Lean Morris will be a prince of apothecaries," said Mr. Raymond.</p> 
               <p>"Capital! our apothecary will match our Mercutio, won't he, Miss Kate?" inquired Mr. Nugent, enthusiastically.</p> 
               <p>As Dwight had predicted, the play elicited universal remark. Although many condemned it, there was a perfect <foreign xml:lang="FRA">qui vive</foreign> for invitations,-some troubled consciences being suddenly calmed by the reception of an unexpected ticket.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Raymond declared it only developed a new phase in the baseness of human nature, but I would not listen to his misanthropy, clearly proving how a little kindness can awake the sun-light of the heart. "Why, that square bit of written card has converted us poor, deluded, sinful creatures, into the most delightful people, a little gay perhaps, but then they are young and rich, let them enjoy themselves while they can; trouble comes fast enough! It will be no hurt just to look at their acting. They are very delightful people, and Mrs. Nugent belongs to a very pious family; so does Miss Bradshaw,-her grandfather was a Clergyman. A very distinguished family!"</p> 
               <p>"Do you distrust Miss Bradshaw's power after this specimen, Mr. Raymond?" Miss Kate laughing asked.</p> 
               <p>"I never distrusted her power, Miss Donaldson, but every one has a peculiar fitness for some things over others."</p> 
               <p>I was not adapted for a Juliet! He should see! but not at the rehearsals; at those, I was careful to go through my part like a school girl. With much glee, I overheard Mr. Raymond wonder to Ann, "why Miss Kate and Mira thought Miss Jessie so talented." Only in my own room to Mira, and once with Dwight, did I give my full scope to my ability.</p> 
               <p>Madam Sprague was delighted at the amusement, and made me a present of a superb silver muslin for the occasion. Dwight brought his mother's jewel box, telling me it was to be retained for that wife or child, "He hoped they would appreciate my care." After some demur, to please him and the others I promised to wear a set of pearls that had been the late Mrs. Sprague's bridal ornaments.</p> 
               <p>The anticipated evening had come;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6399-00000078"/> my last rehearsal was over. "Splendid," had been Mira's and Miss Kate's verdict "Mind and not get flustered," was Miss Kate's final injunction. "I shall so enjoy Raymond's surprise; I am certain he will be completely confounded."</p> 
               <p>I trusted so, for that object I had worked. His applause was the one coveted.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Nugent had fitted a commodious play-room in the third story. The audience had assembled, the actors were summoned to the adjacent green-room.</p> 
               <p>The silver muslin and pearls proved exceedingly becoming; excitement had given brilliance to my eyes and color to my cheeks. I felt that I looked the impassioned daughter of Italy. I think that Mr. Raymond felt it also; a new light kindled in his eyes, as with a quick survey, he advanced and handed me up the ladder-like steps, leading to the stage, a glance that gave me courage for the first act, in which I participated. Miss Kate and Mira were excellent coadjutors, and the scene went off creditably.</p> 
               <p>The next passed with much clat. Mercutio and Romeo won thunders of applause.</p> 
               <p>The festival at the Capulets was enacted; here I held no conspicuous part. My next, the garden scene, was to be the ordeal, for this I nerved myself, but it was with no slight trepidation that I mounted the balcony from which I was to hold the nocturnal conversation with my lover.</p> 
               <p>A palpitating heart and quivering nerves would never do, and as Romeo entered the opposite side of the stage, and the curtain drew aside, with determined effort, I calmed this emotion, and casting off every thought of the audience, advanced to my post. The first words that I distinctly understood were,</p> 
               <p>"It is my lady! O, it is my love!"</p> 
               <p>From that instant, time, place, everything was forgotten; Romeo's impassioned tones were magical. Was that all acting? If so, Mr. Raymond was a great, artiste. I had known that I could do well, but I never thought to have gone through the part with the inspiration my partner called forth.</p> 
               <p>The play moved on like a phantasm. One thing alone I recall, the thrilling shudder, as Mercutio staggered back exclaiming, "No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door, but 'tis enough, 'twill serve." It was so natural, so characteristic!</p> 
               <p>The last act over, I sprang below, and shut myself in my chamber. Mira followed; our dresses arranged, she went to the parlor, but I lingered. "Supper is being served," announced our maid. "You are wanted, Miss."</p> 
               <p>Slowly rising, I as slowly lifted Dwight's mother's jewels. Should I resume them! ought I? After another moment's hesitation, they were quickly clasped, and I hastily stepped forth. What was my surprise to find Mr. Raymond awaiting my exit. Coming forward, his arm was proffered," with a hope that the evening's exertion had not been too fatiguing."</p> 
               <p>The first glance showed that my object was achieved. The formal, reserved Mr. Raymond had vanished, the look and tone were Romeo's!</p> 
               <p>Where was the triumph I had anticipated? Like the child that sets in motion some complicated machinery that he knows not how to stop, I stood aghast at my work. Murmuring an unintelligible reply, I hurried down the stairs, feeling that those deep, earnest, tender eyes were searching me through and through.</p> 
               <p>The supper-room was thronged. Mira was seated with Miss Kate, on a window-seat in the lower hall. Mr. Raymond placed me beside them, "for rest and air."</p> 
               <p>"You sha'n't act Juliet with that man again, mam'selle," whispered Dwight, as he brought the ladies some refreshment.</p> 
               <p>"Who gave you license to dictate terms to me, most admirable Mercutio?" I saucily returned.</p> 
               <p>"Will Miss Bradshaw take a whip?"</p> 
               <p>The voice was the low, measured tones of Mr. Raymond. I turned, and with a blush, for which I was terribly provoked, coolly took the glass, with a frigid "Thank you."</p> 
               <p>The last vestige of the Romeo vanished, but there was a slight smile lingering around the gentleman's thin, finely-cut lips, that I did not exactly relish. Drawing aside from the group around the window, I entered the supper-room, receiving the plaudits of the crowd with a bitter heart, and internal maledictions upon my girlish folly.</p> 
               <p>The Saturday following the play, Miss Kate, Mira, and Dwight returned home. I was to remain a few weeks longer, in order to accompany Mrs. Norton to the country.</p> 
               <p>From the eventful evening of the tragedy, Mr. Raymond had gradually cast aside his usual reserve, till at length he had established, spite of my efforts to the contrary, the familiarity of friendship. As nothing of the Romeo was visible, I at length laid aside the guards which I had summoned, and almost unconsciously yielded to the fascination of his voice and presence. Few could have found a more entertaining or instructive companion, one more ready to sympathize with, or understand every thought and wish, to appreciate the higher points of my character, while he gently led me beyond the many womanly foibles engendered by my place and education.</p> 
               <p>Gradually, we came to talk of everything; nearly every theme had been discussed, save love and religion; when on a Sunday morning, as I entered the parlor, ready attired for church, Ann drew Mr. Raymond's attention to the new bonnet which I was that day to display.</p> 
               <p>"It shows Miss Bradshaw's good taste," he replied, as rising, he threw my tippet over my shoulders.</p> 
               <p>"It does for a black-eyed blue-stocking," I replied, with an arch look into the gentleman's face.</p> 
               <p>"Mercy, mercy, lady!" he exclaimed. "I always suspected you overheard that senseless speech."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Norton, not exactly comprehending the drift of discourse, felt called upon to make a Sabbath-day speech, with a Sabbath-day tone and face, for though no one thought more of earthly vanity through the six days, the Sunday, as far as outward ceremonial and appearance went, was most duly honored. In a low, deprecatory whine, she exclaimed, "Oh, Jessie, it grieves me to see you and Ann so swallowed up with dress and show, and all these finite nothings; remember that it must pass like a breath; that we shall return to that from which we came. My dear, remember you are nothing but dust"</p> 
               <p>"You mistake, Mrs. Norton," I pertly replied. "It is the men that are dust, we women were made of bone, which is, much nicer."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Norton raised her hands and eyes, with the inquiry, "If Mr. Raymond ever saw such a girl?" His deep, emphatic, "No," caused me to questioningly turn with serious, wondering eyes. A slight smile flitted over the face that suddenly had resolved itself into one of its most cold and reserved aspects.</p> 
               <p>Had I done aught to offend? The gentleman understood the look, and returned, "That it was refreshing to meet a woman wholly free from cant."</p> 
               <p>This was of course meant to be complimentary; but what was his religion? I had never known him to attend church.</p> 
               <p>"To what society do you belong, Mr. Raymond?" I inquired.</p> 
               <pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6399-00000079"/> 
               <p>"To none."</p> 
               <p>"Don't you ever attend worship?"</p> 
               <p>"Sometimes, if there is a preacher of literary fame."</p> 
               <p>"Why, haven't you any religion? I hope you are not an infidel."</p> 
               <p>"I am afraid I must own that is what the world would designate me."</p> 
               <p>"The carriage is waiting, Miss," said the footman.</p> 
               <p>"Wont you come with us? perhaps we shall convert you," I asked, as I took my muff. The gentleman sadly shook his head.</p> 
               <p>I had heard so many people called infidels, that Mr. Raymond's assertion did not shock me in the least. Aunt Nabby had branded Uncle John by that stigma, because he did not like Parson Kirkwood, and almost every one agreed in so terming the master, because he chose to have a belief of his own; but I determined to question Mr. Raymond upon the subject, and learn the particulars of his faith.</p> 
               <p>That evening favored my wishes. Mr. Nugent was out; Mrs. Norton and Ann had gone to their rooms, I was alone in the parlor when Mr. Raymond entered. I immediately commenced my investigation. The gentleman tried to change the subject. I should only be shocked. Why would I unveil all his hidden feelings?</p> 
               <p>One by one, I had thrown down the barriers he had erected to screen his heart from the missiles of an antagonistic world; why did I persist in scaling the very stronghold?</p> 
               <p>I did not know why, but I was impelled to do it. He must tell me his belief or non-belief. I should never rest till he did.</p> 
               <p>"You will cast me from you, and I shall lose the only friendship I care to claim."</p> 
               <p>"No, no," I eagerly replied, "if you are in an error, the more reason that your friends should rally to your aid."</p> 
               <p>My companion smiled such a sad, hopeless smile, that my heart ached for him. Then the whole truth was revealed. I had heard of French infidelity, but this was the first time I had encountered it. No mere disbelief of this or that creed, but a total want of faith in everything that one is taught to receive and revere.</p> 
               <p>As the gentleman had said, I was greatly shocked. Here was this man, so gifted, so intellectual, so educated, unable to recognize the existence even of his own great soul. No God, no Savior, no Bible, no soul, no existence hereafter, was his creed. "Nature gave all, took all. Man the highest order of animal, came in the order of nature like other creations, to pass away like them. Nothing was ever annihilated; matter must ever exist in some form. Our bodies were reproduced through the ages, but this was the whole; what was termed 'soul,' merely consisted in the construction of the brain; let that decay, all decayed,-was at an end."</p> 
               <p>This assertion aroused me from the stupor of horror and astonishment my companion's words had caused. I thought of Mr. Turner. It was not so! That poor, crazy man had possessed more sense than his witch-deluded nurses. His brain was obscured, but still an intangible something peeped forth, bright gleams of an essence that decay could not reach.</p> 
               <p>These thoughts were repeated to my friend, with a recital of the facts that had engendered them. We talked far into the night. I had become wrought to a high pitch of excitement, when suddenly a thought came, which I instantly expressed.</p> 
               <p>"Either you or I am right, Mr. Raymond. There is such a thing as truth, and I <emph>will find it.</emph> Bring me the books you have mentioned, let me read and compare. You allow that I am not bigoted; I will cast aside every preconceived idea, and judge for my self."</p> 
               <p>"I know that you will! If I did not know that you would now never rest till you have put this design in execution, I would never accede to your wish; as it is, I have no option but to obey. You shall have the books, but oh, my dear lady, if there is a God in Heaven, I hope and pray that he will keep you from the abyss of doubt and despair into which I have been compelled to plunge. You must not think that I have accepted my present views from the happiness or peace they brought. Oh, no, I would fain have believed! Oftentimes, I have envied the most credulous people, but you can understand me, Jessie; my reason must be satisfied or I cannot receive."</p> 
               <p>Yes, I did understand him; dissimilar as we were in many respects, in others there was a perfect soul union. What did this portend? questioned my fluttering heart; then my Christian "name," (it was the first time he had ever pronounced it) sounded so new and strange from his lips! Life was putting on a new phase, but I would not seek to pierce the future; the present, with its self-imposed task, should receive every thought.</p> 
               <p>A week of storms, succeeded by a severe cold, facilitated my research, studied and thought, I investigated and compared. I was interested, instructed a new sphere was opened, a world of science of which I had never dreamed but each of these sceptical works produced upon my mind just the contrary effect from what their authors had intended; instead of weakening, they strengthened my faith; that which before had been a mere blind reception, became a vivid reality.</p> 
               <p>It was much easier to believe that this universe with its magnitude and sublimity, its beauty and order, was the emanation from one grand, beneficent mind, than that it fell by chance from chaos. Chance! could there be such a thing? No; daily experience proved a power and guidance above mere accident.</p> 
               <p>Through science, I the more clearly discerned the God in nature; through a thorough search of His Word, I recognized the God of revelation,-saw how through the ages He had shown Himself by prophet and seer; lastly, by His own well beloved Son, who came to manifest Him to the world, to glorify Him on earth.</p> 
               <p>The Word became flesh and dwelt among us; the Alpha and the Omega I Blessed are those that casting aside the love of self and the world, turn with truly spiritual affections towards the Lord and toward their neighbor, living a life of love, charity and use, becoming daily more and more consociated with the angels, more and more recipient of that heavenly kingdom which may dwell in every breast; true branches of the True Vine. To them shall come the voice out of heaven, saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people." "And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes." "He that overcometh shall inherit all things: and I will be his God, and he shall be my son."</p> 
               <p>These truths were expressed to my sceptical friend with all the clearness and force which I could command.</p> 
               <p>First he listened in silence, then refuted and argued; finally, the justice of many of my statements was acknowledged. "He would reconsider, he would reinvestigate."</p> 
               <p>As was to be expected, this new friendship elicited much comment. The Nugents were too well bred for<pb n="152" xml:id="VAC6399-00000080"/> innuendo, but their satisfaction was hourly evident. Mrs. Norton, with less delicacy, declared her delight.</p> 
               <p>"Madam Compton had better talk about her Ann! Mr. Nugent, though he did n't go to meeting very often, wasn't an infidel; not but what she thought Mr. Raymond plenty good enough for me. Young men would be young men; both Nugent and Raymond would settle down into respectable, staid fathers of families by-and-by."</p> 
               <p>The Misses Sprague were excessively indignant.</p> 
               <p>"Engaged, almost as I had been, to their Cousin Dwight from a child! Poor Dwight! It was shameful!"</p> 
               <p>Madam Sprague laid aside her gout sufficiently to pay me a visit during my indisposition.</p> 
               <p>"Surely, I was not going to discard her nephew? That Mr. Raymond was a stern, dark man. There were strange stories respecting his family. The uncle from whom he had inherited his fortune was a terrible miser, and his money would never bring a blessing. Dwight was wayward, but he was gaining fame; if he would be an artist perhaps Mr. Sprague would assist him; a great deal depended on my countenance. I was a favorite with Mr. Sprague."</p> 
               <p>"Then Mr. Sprague might become profuse, for Dwight was the same to me he had ever been; no one could ever usurp his place."</p> 
               <p>The lady looked surprised, but took leave with much cordiality.</p> 
               <p>My Aunt Compton, and other female relatives, seemed to place sufficient reliance upon my discretion to allow me to follow my inclination but both James and my Uncle Rutledge, did not disguise their pleasure at the turn affairs had taken. I was to prolong my stay as long as I pleased, go where liked; my guardian was perfectly satisfied with such an escort as Mr. Raymond.</p> 
               <p>The morning of my departure, Mr. Raymond brought some choice books as a parting gift. "Miss Jessie," he said, in a low, serious tone, "You have done what schools and divines have failed to effect. I had settled benumbed, torpid, faithless, hopeless, into a mere breathing machine; below the beasts, for they perform the functions for which they were created. You have brought doubt, curiosity, lack of confidence in myself, restlessness,-a new life. Through you, I am becoming abased, thereby exalted. May I not have the pleasure of hearing from you sometimes?"</p> 
               <p>Determined not to encourage undue hopes, I replied, that as he intended to accompany Mrs. Nugent to the country soon, and as I should be very busy after so long an absence, he must excuse me from writing. With that peculiar smile which I could never exactly fathom, he returned, "Tell your friend Dwight to add prudence, as well as wisdom, to your cognomen. You merit both."</p>

               <p>"That is not strange; I have lived five ordinary years in the past five weeks."</p> 
               <p>"What kind of a man is this Mr. Raymond, Jessie?"</p> 
               <p>I smiled. "I said nothing of Mr. Raymond. You can judge for yourself ere long, as he intends paying us a visit."</p> 
               <p>"Now don't be foolish. James says you deny an engagement, but I surely am to have your confidence."</p> 
               <p>"Certainly; Mr. Raymond never spoke of love to me since our acquaintance."</p> 
               <p>"But would he not have done so, if permitted?"</p> 
               <p>"How can I say, ma chere. It was my business not to permit it."</p> 
               <p>Genevieve laughed. "You are a queer girl. James and your uncle desire the match."</p> 
               <p>"So I perceive. Why is it?"</p> 
               <p>"Oh, it is desirable in every way. Gentlemen like to matrimonially dispose of the young ladies under their care."</p> 
               <p>"Just as if marriage was the one thing needful! I wonder how the world would get on without the old maids?"</p> 
               <p>With increased merriment, Genevieve declared, "One would suppose I intended to join that much abused sisterhood."</p> 
               <p>"That had become my fixed determination. Miss Betty Bradshaw was happy; her life was rich and complete."</p> 
               <p>"Certainly, in the divine order, she had been placed alone in her earthly pilgrimage, but Jessie," my Mend continued with anxiety, "decide nothing rashly. The love of a really good, noble and true heart ought never to be disregarded."</p> 
               <p>"I was sensible how truly she spoke." Again kissing the baby, I bade its mother a good morning, and walked over to Dwight's studio.</p> 
               <p>The young man had rented a suit of rooms in State street. Home letters had informed me that his time was fully occupied; that order had succeeded order with unprecedented rapidity; that he was rising in both skill and popularity.</p> 
               <p>The artist was busily employed upon my entrance, but started up with an exclamation of pleasure, as I stepped beside his easel.</p> 
               <p>In a short interview the previous evening, I had seen that he had grown thin and pale, but I was not prepared for the change, now disclosed by the morning light.</p> 
               <p>"You are not looking well, Dwight," I said, as I seated myself to criticise his work.</p> 
               <p>"How can I, leading this dog's life? You may think me an egotist, but I am too much of a real artist to relish portrait painting. It is worse than the treadmill."</p> 
               <p>My heart sank; I had hoped he had found his vocation. This chagrin was not permitted to appear however, as I replied: "You have worked too steadily; take a vacation; things then will look different."</p> 
               <p>"When my present engagements are completed, I shall retire from the trade, for it is nothing but a trade. I should prefer house-painting; that would not put my patience to such a test. You have no conception what dolts this world is composed of, Jessie. Wrinkled, bald old men, must be spruced up into youthful beaux; youths must be turned into Apollos; stout, red-faced grandames expect to be metamorphosed into sylphs and shepherdesses; skinny old maids will be painted as blooming Hebes; the young ladies choose the Lydia Languish style, and every freckled, snub-nosed child must be turned into<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6399-00000082"/> an angel or cherub. It is enough to drive one mad."</p> 
               <p>I could not refrain from laughing. "Poor fellow," I exclaimed, with mock pity; "what a bad world it is to use you so hard."</p> 
               <p>"You may laugh, Miss Wisdom; I will have my revenge."</p> 
               <p>"So you shall. Finish here, then come to the master's and paint Aunt Compton's portrait."</p> 
               <p>"That is what I intend. I wish to paint hers, your Grandmother Stuart's, and a few others, then farewell to art!"</p> 
               <p>"No, no; real art shall then come."</p> 
               <p>"Does Mrs. Raymond intend to patronize me?" he asked, with a comical look.</p> 
               <p>"I scarcely think there will ever be such a lady; if there is, I hope she would assist you if it was necessary." A thought had struck me, and I ventured to add, "But seriously, Dwight, Mr. Raymond might prove a valuable friend to you."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you," he dryly returned, "I think I can exist without the pale of the Grand Mogul."</p> 
               <p>"You are unjust, Dwight. Mr. Raymond has knowledge and experience; he would advise you with pleasure."</p> 
               <p>"Knowledge has he? What has this sage taught you?" the young man demanded, in an ironical tone, as his searching gaze fell full into my eyes. My heart beat quickly, but in a steady voice I replied, "Never again to dare to judge my fellow mortals. If we would unveil the inner life of each, we should find too much for pity to wish to condemn."</p> 
               <p>Dwight bowed his head, murmuring, "True, true, Jessie, forgive me; God alone knows how my soul is tortured."</p> 
               <p>I soothingly replied, "'Every branch that beareth fruit, He purgeth it that it may bear more fruit.' You must live up to your doctrine, my good friend. You know you hold that one can overcome the world and be of good cheer."</p> 
               <p>"True, true, Miss Wisdom, but you will learn soon enough that it is vastly easier to preach than to practise; not but what your homilies deserve to be preserved in letters of gold. From boyhood, you have been my consolation; don't desert me now." I was greatly touched by the low supplicatory tone of this last appeal, but managed to gaily reply, "Come and dine with me at Miss Betty's; we will give you new energy for the afternoon's labors."</p> 
               <p>"Going to Miss Betty's? I will come in an hour; at present I am momently expecting a sitter."</p> 
               <p>As I descended the street, Dwight's voice rang in my ears and mingled with recollections of Mr. Raymond's tone. How much more are the real inward feelings disclosed in accents than by words,-an indication of that spiritual communion to be enjoyed hereafter.</p> 
               <p>What was I, that these two gifted men should thus claim my comfort and support? Crushed, overwhelmed with a terrible sense of ignorance and weakness, my soul cried in earnest supplication to the source of all wisdom and strength. Since infancy, I had made daily petitions, but I believe that I may truly say, that this was the first time I had ever really prayed.</p> 
               <p>Miss Betty's cheerful room and cordial welcome were doubly grateful from the previous excitement. As I gazed at the maiden's placid face I longed to ask if her heart had always been at rest.</p> 
               <p>Why should I? If it had never been tried, how could she sympathize with me? If it had, why should I disturb the still waters that had gathered above the billows of disquiet? Dwight had been right; every heart must bear its own burthen, heroically, not darkening those of others.</p> 
               <p>The artist came at the early dinner hour usual to the old-fashioned household. No one could have thought from his easy, jovial air, that he ever had a care or grief.</p> 
               <p>My return to the parsonage was hailed with joy, but I was again summoned from its peacful walls.</p> 
               <p>As the spring advanced, Genevieve's health began to fail with such rapidity that her friends and physicians became justly alarmed,-a journey to Saratoga was proposed.</p> 
               <p>As James could not conveniently leave his business, it was decided that Dwight and I should accompany Mrs. Lee.</p> 
               <p>A light, two-seated carriage and a span of horses having been procured, and fashionable riding habits made, our wardrobe was squeezed into two small trunks and a carpet bag,-nurse and baby having been transferred to the parsonage,-the first of June we commenced the then arduous tour.</p> 
               <p>As we were obliged to travel by easy stages, our first night was passed at a tavern on the Chester turnpike, a large unpainted structure, amidst stables and sheds, standing in a clearing, where a crop was struggling up between the burnt stumps and thickly strewn rocks. I had never before visited New Hampshire, and the rude mountainous scenery was as novel as surprising.</p> 
               <p>The morning being very fine, and Genevieve in high spirits, a ride before breakfast was proposed. The pleasant village of Pembroke was reached with invigorated nerves and a good appetite. We had learned the previous evening that this was Election-day. The road leading to Concord was lively with vehicles, and the town presented stirring spectacle. The hotel was crowded, but, at Dwight's request, Genevieve and I were shown to a private parlor, but our sanctum was soon invaded by wives and daughters of the members of the legislature. All were gaily dressed, and in a lively, excited mood. We were supposed to belong to their number, and much to my amusement, I overheard one lady whisper another, that we must belong to the Portsmouth members, as she was certain we came from below. Another exceedingly showy woman begged, with many excuses, to know if that was the last fashion for bonnets, while a third admired our riding habits. As I turned to answer a query respecting the velvet facings, my hand was seized with an exclamation of surprise; I was so confused that for a second I did not recognize my old schoolmate, Milly Mead, the heroine of the scripture Recitations, and the nocturnal foray.</p> 
               <p>"Why, Jessie, where did you come from? have you married one of our honorable members?"</p> 
               <p>"No, have you? I am on my way to Saratoga," I added, as I introduced Genevieve. "Now let us see the husband, Milly."</p> 
               <p>"Fudge, don't talk of husbands. I am here with father. You must see him. When I find his equal, I shall marry. But permit me to make you acquainted with my friends." I found that we had been thrown into most distinguished company. There was Mrs. General this, and Mrs. Colonel that, the Honorable Mrs. Something, and the Rev. Mrs. Somebody. For a republican court, titles were unusually prominent. Mr. Senator Mead was brought by his daughter. Dwight joined us, and a social half-hour ensued.</p> 
               <p>Milly had been inquiring for all her old friends, when a tall, over-dressed woman bashfully asked if that was Miss Bradshaw from Massachusetts? "Excuse my asking, but I have heard our minister, Parson Rodes, and his wife, talk so much of her, that I feel almost acquainted."</p> 
               <p>"Parson Rodes! was his parish in the neighborhood?"</p> 
               <pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6399-00000083"/> 
               <p>"About ten miles farther on; we must call, as we should pass the house."</p> 
               <p>"We would do so. The parson was an acceptable preacher?"</p> 
               <p>"Why, yes; he was not so deep as some, but quite an orator. His wife was much of a lady, almost too accomplished for a country pastor's wife; but a very agreeable woman."</p> 
               <p>Milly was anxious that we should remain for the day, go with her to hear the election sermon, but Genevieve did not feel equal to the exertion. After an early dinner, we again set forth. Dwight was ecstatic at the prospect of calling upon Parson Rodes, and enlivened the ride by giving Genevieve a description of the clergyman's and my love passages. His recital was so comical, that she at last bade him hush; laughter was a good medicine, "but one must not have too much of a good thing."</p> 
               <p>According to direction, we drew up before a square-frame house, which, with a small barn, stood upon a rocky knoll. The buildings were in good repair, but the premises bore a slovenly, uninviting aspect. A small, untidy girl opened the door, while two white-headed, dirty children peeped from behind her skirts. We were shown into a cheerless parlor, close and dusty. The little parson came instantly, evidently feeling the gratification he expressed at the visit. Mrs. Rodes was more tardy in her appearance; from the profusion of bows, had probably arranged her dress before descending. She looked worn and faded; excused the non-appearance of her children, and deplored the scarcity of good help. Both the parson and his wife invited us to pass the night,-the lady being exceedingly pressing, when she found there was no probability of our doing so.</p> 
               <p>That night we spent at a neat farm tavern. I was admiring the prospect, when a little girl, the innkeeper's daughter, asked me to "Go and see Granny. She wanted to see the lady from below."</p> 
               <p>Entering a large, quiet bedroom, I found a nice old lady seated in an armchair; beside her a stand on which were a Bible and hymn-book. "My dear, you are kind to visit an old woman, but you live in the town where the blessed Mr. Whitefield died?"</p> 
               <p>I replied in the affirmative.</p> 
               <p>"Dear, dear, then you have visited his tomb, I suppose." I was obliged to confess that I had not; but I had been in the old South meeting-house under which his remains reposed.</p> 
               <p>"The dear suz, lived so near all yer life, and never visited Whitefield's tomb! Why, I allers thought if I went within forty mile, I 'd go to it."</p> 
               <p>How important familiar things become when viewed from a distance! I had never attached the least weight to the fact that the grave of the renowned divine was in our midst; now it was with a feeling of shame that I declared my previous indifference. "Did you ever hear the celebrated preacher?" I asked.</p> 
               <p>"Dear heart; yes, indeed; I was converted under his preaching." Then the old lady proceeded to give a graphic description of the marvellous career of the wonderful man. "Go to see his tomb, my dear, for my sake," was her parting behest.</p> 
               <p>The Connecticut having been crossed in a ferry-boat, we soon began to ascend the mountains, thus experiencing a variety of temperature in a few hours. The country put on a less rugged aspect, and the farms were superb. We passed the Hudson at Glen's Falls, one of the prettiest cataracts the world has produced. New England behind, the Dutch origin of the people became obvious. Nothing could exceed the neatness of the public houses. The landlady of one of these amused us greatly, by the explanation that being heiress to the premises, she had married her New England husband, "because Yankees were always smarter than Dutchmen"</p> 
               <p>The afternoon preceding our arrival in Saratoga, we became bewildered. Our road was of the worst description; but as a church spire towered in the distance, we pushed on, till we found ourselves in the midst of a Dutch settlement.</p> 
               <p>Drawing up before the first house, a woman in a short, loose gown, and skirt patched in divers colors, a white cloth cap, and bare feet, came to the door. It was evident that she was not familiar with our mother tongue. To our enquiry respecting the route, she stammered: "I will call mine goot man."</p> 
               <p>"Mine goot, man" appeared, smoking a short pipe. We were, as we had suspected, two miles out of the way, but felt repaid for the trouble, by this glimpse of what seemed to us a foreign land. At sunset, we reached our destination. The famed watering place was then a mere village, with some half-dozen houses of entertainment, a church, and three or four stores. We proceeded to the first hotel, a large, wooden building, with a piazza running along its front.</p> 
               <p>I had but just divested myself of my dusty habit, when an exclamation of admiration from Genevieve drew me to the window; I was to look at that "grand homme."</p> 
               <p>What was my surprise to encounter the glance of Mr Raymond's dark eyes. He instantly recognized me with a smile and bow.</p> 
               <p>Genevieve looked from one to the other. "Your Mr. Raymond is superb," she exclaimed, as I drew back. "I disclaim that pronoun, Madam, but how did you know it was Mr. Raymond?"</p> 
               <p>"By your face."</p> 
               <p>Assuring the lady that she had become a perfect Yankee, I ran below, leaving her muttering something about that "pauvre garcon, Dwight."</p> 
               <p>Mr. Raymond was proceeding to survey a tract of wild land that he owned farther west. He passed the evening with us, while Dwight amused himself with a party of emigrants on their way to Ohio, the then distant El-Dorado of the western pioneer. The next morning, the gentlemen accompanied us to Congress spring. A platform and railing enclosed the fountain, but its surroundings were still in a state of nature. "Round Rock" and "Flat Rock," were in the midst of a pasture; the whole village presented a barren, straggling appearance.</p> 
               <p>Dwight was in one of his silent fits; Mr. Raymond, on the contrary, was remarkably conversable.</p> 
               <p>As the waiter handed the rack of foaming tumblers, Mr. Raymond seized one, Dwight another; both were quickly presented to me; I noted the look that had been interchanged as this was done, and quick as a flash understood their meaning. Womanly tact came to the rescue, without the slightest hesitation, I took Mr. Raymond's glass, and handed it to Genevieve, then snatching Dwight's, I held it to his lips with the playful command, "To t drink it, drain it to the very dregs, without a grimace!"</p> 
               <p>A merry scene ensued, which established the easy familiarity I designed during the walk. Breakfast over, Mr. Raymond made his adieu, and we rode over to Ballston.</p> 
               <p>The water proving beneficial to Genevieve, our stay was prolonged through the month. As the season advanced, visitors began to throng in from every quarter of the Union. An aged gentleman from Vermont, and his invalid daughter, became pleasant<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6399-00000084"/> companions, and the advent of a gay southern family added zest to the daily routine.</p> 
               <p>There was all the novelty of a strange people in a strange place; this was heightened by the numerous bands of emigrants continually passing west. These parties were as motley as the various degrees and funds of those composing them. Some were equipped with every convenience possible for the arduous journey; others barely possessed the means for existence and locomotion. One wealthy yeoman moved his family in a frame building drawn by his numerous draft animals, while a large drove of cattle and sheep brought up the rear. The caravan presented a singular spectacle as it moved slowly past; the smoke curling from the stove pipe, and the women busy at their household tasks within the house.</p> 
               <p>In direct contrariety to this thrift, came a few hours later, a cart drawn by one yoke of lean oxen, in which was deposited a meagre supply of housekeeping stuff. Upon the one featherbed sat the mistress of the family, while her lord drove the patient team; a girl of fourteen trudged behind driving a cow. I have often thought of that barefooted girl, wondered what had been her fate. I trust that she was permitted to see "the wilderness blossom as the rose," and that her children and children's children rose up to bless.</p> 
               <p>A Quaker bride that came to the village on a bridal tour, in a Dutch wagon, with her husband and sister, interested me exceedingly. Like her feminine sisters, out of the meeting, she had regaled herself with the purchase of a bridal bonnet. I was called to examine it, pronounce upon its merits, and its superiority over the old one. I performed what was expected, but for the life of me could not have distinguished the one from the other; both were equally handsome and fresh.</p> 
               <p>A slight hint of this idea brought an eager assurance that the old bonnet was soiled.</p> 
               <p>"Couldn't I see that spot?" I descried the minute speck, and parted from the sisters with a strong belief in Peggy's assertion, "that human nature is the same everywhere," and afirm conviction that a Quakeress in her plain costume could show as much fastidiousness and love of dress as the most showy belle.</p> 
               <p>Another source of amusement, was the oddities of the various invalids, and the way in which they imbibed the healing waters. The most mirth-provoking scenes often occurred at the springs,-such grimacing, spitting, and sputtering from novices, such indignation and disgust, it was impossible not to laugh.</p> 
               <p>One old lady took the matter more coolly. She came in a wagon, with her daughter and son-in-law, from her home on a large farm, at some twenty miles distance. She had long been afflicted with a disease in the nerve of the eye, and at last, had come to try the efficacy of Saratoga water.</p> 
               <p>"Get a pitcher full, John," said she, "and I will sit down here with these young women, and drink, while you and Sally fill the bottles and kegs."</p> 
               <p>The two-quart pitcher having been filled, the old lady placed herself at the table and commenced the task of imbibing it. At every mouthful she would turn with a wry face, and exclaim, "I can't say it tastes very nice, but then I 've detarmined to give it a good try."</p> 
               <p>She was as good as her word. In a couple of hours the water had all been swallowed; this was topped off by a hearty dinner, when the dame mounted into her wagon, with the declaration, "That she raly believed there was some thin' in that water, she felt better aready."</p> 
               <p>Since his encounter with Mr. Raymond, Dwight had been singularly moody and taciturn; under the pretence of sketching, he passed much of his time in solitary rambles. I was only too glad to see the roguish dimples playing about his mouth, as he handed the old lady an extra bottle, with the grave assurance, that "If she would double this day's dose on the morrow, her cure would undoubtedly be effected."</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER XXIX.</head> 
               <head type="sub">SUMMER DAYS.</head> 
               <p>As Genevieve still continued delicate, it was decided that she should reside at the parsonage through the warm weather. At first, James remained in town through the week, visiting us on Sunday, but in a short time, he declared the ride to and fro, morning and evening, to be just what his health needed, and unless kept by business, his nights were spent in the country. Mr. and Mrs. Nugent arrived in July; they were speedily followed by Mr. Raymond. Mr. Nugent's stay was short. Much to every one's relief, he found our neighborhood insufferably dull, and took himself to livelier quarters.</p> 
               <p>Nothing surprised me more than the friendship between Mr. Nugent and Mr. Raymond. Upon expressing it to the latter, he gravely replied: "Nugent was my benefactor when I was penniless and friendless. You do not believe in total depravity, Jessie; have charity even for this man."</p> 
               <p>After Mr. Nugent's departure, Mr. Raymond established himself at the "Golden Ball," the pleasant tavern on the main road.</p> 
               <p>Dwight had also come to the master's. He had kept his word, and given up his rooms in town. Aunt Compton's portrait was commenced, but it progressed slowly. The artist often complained of headache and lassitude; he grew paler and thinner, indolent, and almost peevish.</p> 
               <p>Though Mr. Raymond had become alive to the fallacy of several of his heretofore most strongly cherished opinions, he was still in an extremely unsettled and doubtful state.</p> 
               <p>As he became a visitor at all hours, and soon obtained the freedom of the house, Peggy acquired an inkling of this, and in her most determined tones, declared he' must be set right. "He was a bigger infidel than the master; and though he couldn't hold a candle to Dwight, he mus'n't be lost; she should speak her mind to him."</p> 
               <p>A few hours later gave the desired opportunity. A heavy shower had beaten my morning-glories from their trellise; as Mr. Raymond stepped out to raise them, the sun burst forth through the still falling drops, and a perfect rainbow instantly spanned the heavens. The gentleman turned, and gazed long and silently, then, with a sigh, he reentered the door, exclaiming: "I wish I could believe in what I have never seen, and what I cannot understand. If the cause of everything was as clear as this bow, one would have some satisfaction. I do wish I had a little faith."</p> 
               <p>"You have a great deal," upspoke Peggy, as she came from the kitchen. "You do believe in a great many things that you have never seen and cannot understand. Don't ye believe in the Dark Day?"</p> 
               <p>"Was it so very dark? You cannot remember it, Peggy; you were too young," he gallantly replied.</p> 
               <p>"None of yer gammon," she smilingly replied. "I was nine year old, and I remember it as though it was<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6399-00000085"/> yesterday. It was a clear, bright morning. Arter breakfast, I went to clean the garret; the growing darkness made me look out. A thick, black cloud was rising in the west. Thinking there would be a shower, I ran below. The clock struck nine as I went into the kitchen. The cloud rose and spread over the whole sky, but there was no rain. The cows came up to the barn, the poultry went to roost, and the birds flew to their nests, jest as if it had been sundown. A solemn sort of twilight spread round; we were obliged to light a candle at dinner. It was sort of fearful, but marm kept us pretty cheerful. She said it was God's work, and we need n't fear. We children allers believed what marm telled us; but somehow, we did n't feel like play, but sat down quiet-like, as if it was Sunday.</p> 
               <p>"Some folks were terribly scared; many families fell to reading the Bible and praying, thinking that the Judgmarnt day was coming. Poor fools, did n't they allers know that it would come some time!"</p> 
               <p>Mr. Raymond smiled, and inquired if the night was darker than usual.</p> 
               <p>"Jest as much darker as the day. Now, Mr. Raymond, you believe every word I've spoken, yet you can't tell what caused this darkness, but you've faith that there was a cause; so, if you please, you can have faith in higher things. If some folks would try as hard to be humble and teachable as they do to set theirselves up to cavil and control, they'd be a deal better themselves, and a deal pleasanter for other people."</p> 
               <p>Genevieve clapped her hands, exclaiming: "Bon, bon; you ought to turn field-preacher, Peggy."</p> 
               <p>Mr. Raymond smiled, but his eyes were grave and thoughtful. Genevieve and I had been waiting the cessation of the rain for a ride to South-end. James had purchased each a saddle-horse, upon which we took daily exercise. As we turned into the sitting-room, Dwight rose to fetch the steeds. He had been perusing Southey's Thalaba; as he placed the open volume upon the table, he read:- <q>
                     <lg type="quotation"> 
                        <l rend="ti-1">"The unsuspecting youth</l> 
                        <l>Held forth his finger to draw off the spell.</l> 
                        <l rend="ti-1">Even whilst he held it forth,</l> 
                        <l rend="ti-1">There settled there a wasp,</l> 
                        <l>And just above the gem infixed his dart.</l> 
                        <l>All purple swollen, the hot and painful flesh</l> 
                        <l rend="ti-1">Rose round the tightened ring.</l> 
                        <l>The baffled sorcerer knew the hand of heaven,</l> 
                        <l rend="ti-1">And inwardly blasphemed."</l> 
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p> 
               <p>"That is a pretty good epitome of life," he continued, taking his hat. "The wasp often comes to save us from destruction, but we are not apt to recognize the hand of heaven, though not slow to inwardly blaspheme."</p> 
               <p>Mr. Raymond turned and gazed earnestly into his young companion's face. Dwight caught the glance; with an equivocal look, half gay, half sad, he went for the horses.</p> 
               <p>Aunt Nabby had been brought to a toleration of the popish woman; with Grandma'am she had become an especial favorite. We were gaily chatting in her room when an approaching horseman drew our attention.</p> 
               <p>"Who can it be!" exclaimed Aunt Nabby, "he looks like a minister."</p> 
               <p>"Why it's Sam, my son Sam! "ejaculated Grandma'am in surprise, as the visitor dismounted to open the gate.</p> 
               <p>"What upon airth brings him here, jest in haying time? Some fool's errand or other, I'll warrant!" cried Aunt Nabby.</p> 
               <p>With much curiosity we hastened to meet our relative, and learn the cause of his unexpected visit.</p> 
               <p>He had been to Lynn to be ordained. "I am now a regular preacher of the Methodist persuasion," he explained with grave pride.</p> 
               <p>"A reglar fool ye'd better say!" burst in Aunt Nabby, "Who's getting yer hay' while ye'r getting made preacher? Where's the salary ye are to live on, if ye won't take care of yer farm? yer relations have done about as much as they can afford for ye aready; ye mustn't look to them next winter."</p> 
               <p>There was certainly truth and sense in Aunt Nabby's tirade, if not politeness; but we were silenced and impressed by the elevated, solemn air and tone in which Uncle Sam replied, "Sister Lee, I have meat to eat that ye know not of."</p> 
               <p>Completely taken aback, Aunt Nabby bustled out to prepare supper, and the conversation diverged into other channels. This was the first meeting between Uncle Sam and Genevieve; each was mutually pleased with the other.</p> 
               <p>"This connection of yours is a remarkable man, Jessie," she said, as we rode down the avenue. "He is following his destiny; never interfere with his preaching, it is from God."</p> 
               <p>"I have always felt that it was, but some things, are provoking to people who have only a mere worldly discernment."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you for the compliment implied in that speech, Miss Egotist. I shall report you to James, who certainly comes within your category of worldly people. Suppose we ride on; mon mari must be near home; he would enjoy our company."</p> 
               <p>I acquiesced with pleasure. Mr. Raymond joined us as we passed the "Golden Ball." We met James just at the entrance of a green lane leading to the river.</p> 
               <p>"There is Dwight sketching in the burying-ground; I am going to surprise him," said Genevieve, as she turned, and galloped forward. Springing lightly from the saddle, she passed through the rustic gate and ran up the hill. A light laugh told of the artist's maze. We followed, and joined the two in the cemetery, who were comparing the sketch with the reality. The setting sun cast a roseate splendor over the rolling elevations and blue river, which mirror-like reflected the bright clouds, green hills, arched bridge, and hamlet on the farther bank. Brown houses nestled cosily amid the swelling uplands; the smoke of evening fires curled slowly skywards; sheep dotted the pastures, and kine moved lazily homewards through the green lanes. Dwight had made an accurate copy, with the moss-grown headstones in the foreground.</p> 
               <p>"What a sweet spot this is," said Genevieve, as she advanced up the slight acclivity. "One might feel content to lay their bones here. I suppose," she continued, turning to her husband, "that our place will be on the hill, beside your grandfather."-"Our nearest relatives are on the hill; but many of my ancestors are buried here."</p> 
               <p>"Then bury me here, just here; the prospect is the finest from this point."</p> 
               <p>"Do you expect to look at it out of your grave?" Dwight lightly queried. "You equal the Irish woman, who wanted to be buried amongst more folks."</p> 
               <p>"I sympathize with Mrs. Lee," said Mr. Raymond, as he stepped to her side. "My kindred are cooped in a noisome church vault, but I should like to lie on this breezy spot, surrounded by so much of nature's loveliness."</p> 
               <p>For a moment the two thus stood, side by side, looking into the gathering twilight with serious, far-gazing eyes.</p> 
               <p>James, with his accustomed prudence, reminded his wife that the dew was failing. Slowly we passed out between the graves, and remounted. Dwight walked beside Genevieve, holding her bridle, while she inspected his sketch-book. James rode on her other side, Mr. Raymond and I went forward.</p> 
               <pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6399-00000086"/> 
               <p>Mr. Raymond had been unusually grave during the evening; we had reached the head of the lane in silence, when he suddenly turned, with the remark, "That Mr. Sprague had great talent; it was a pity for him to relinquish art." I replied that "He must not relinquish it."</p> 
               <p>A slight smile curled the gentleman's handsome mouth, as he asked, "Have you the right or power to impose this <emph>must not?</emph>"</p> 
               <p>"No right, and I have doubts respecting the power."</p> 
               <p>The grave face lighted. "You two have been friends from childhood; you must be very dear to each other."</p> 
               <p>"Yes."</p> 
               <p>"Does that lingering, doubtful 'yes' mean 'no'?"</p> 
               <p>"Certainly not." The conversation was converging into a dangerous channel. I touched Jenny, and galloped lightly forward.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Nugent and Dwight's cousin, Miss Sprague, stood in the front door of Squire Norton's house. Ann motioned us to stop. Miss Sprague was visiting at the Squire's; she had received letters from her sister, who had been married to a Virginian a few weeks previous,-letters describing her bridal tour and new home.</p> 
               <p>The rest of our party came up, and Miss Sprague proceeded to read her sister's epistles. As these were refolded, we were joined by Polly Brown and Debby Prime.</p> 
               <p>Debby had become affianced to a spruce young physician in a neighboring town; the clat of her match and the splendor of her "fixing out," had been the chief gossip for months. She had come to pay Polly a parting visit previous to her nuptials.</p> 
               <p>It was Friday night; Polly's school labors were over for that week, and she wished to make up a party for a whortleberry, excursion across the river. "Father says the berries are unusually large in our pasture." As she spoke, William Norton and Ruthy's husband approached. William said he was ready to go, and inquired if the company would not second his motion.</p> 
               <p>Miss Sprague, Mr. Raymond and I replied in the affirmative; Ann excused herself; James said an engagement would prevent his going, but Genevieve must represent him.</p> 
               <p>"Come and spend the day with Ruthy, Mrs. Lee," said Mr. Osborn, "you and Jessie. I will lend my boat for the excursion, but have hay that must be got in, so must be excused."</p> 
               <p>Genevieve thanked him, and inquired respecting her baby.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Ruthy and the nurse will tend her. Don't make another objection!" James gaily commanded, as he playfully placed his hand over her lips. "You women have so many ifs and ands! I wish you to see the view from the other shore."</p> 
               <p>Every preliminary having been arranged, we rode forward, leaving Dwight to escort Polly and Debby.</p> 
               <p>As I entered the hall, Aunt Compton came from her room to tell me that farmer Prime wished to see me on business.</p> 
               <p>Much surprised, I entered the sitting-room. The rich yeoman was seated in the great chair. He rose as I went in, bobbing his head, "He hoped I was hearty;" reseating himself and rubbing his knees with great gusto, while his face grew as radiant as the full moon that shone upon it, he began: "I s'pose ye've heerd what a match our Debby is gwine to make. She's done pooty well," rubbing harder, "pooty well. Now, the women think a deal of toggery, and I allers meant to give my only darter as good a fixing as my neighbors. I want to do as well by Debby as the Squire did by Ann. Well, ye see, Jessie, I'm allers buying land, and that takes my ready cash. I can't raise jest as much as I want jest now, and wife says, 'Go to Jessie Bradshaw; she'll accommodate ye, she'll let ye have some of her rusty dollars.' I'll give a note for six months, payable on demand, and you shall have seven per cent interist, lady-bird."</p> 
               <p>Much amused, I replied that I had no power to transact business, but, should be happy to loan him the money at the usual rate of interest. I would speak to my guardian.</p> 
               <p>What was my chagrin to find that James would not hear a word respecting the matter: "Old Prime might get money where he could; the old curmudgeon should have none of mine."</p> 
               <p>In vain I pleaded for it for old friendship's sake; it was useless. Greatly vexed, I was compelled to acquaint the old man with Mr. Lee's decision. Though I softened the denial as much as possible, I saw that it had given great offence. It was the first time James had ever thwarted my wishes. I could not see any reason for it now; discomposed and somewhat indignant, I was seeking my room, when Mr. Raymond's voice summoned me to the library.</p> 
               <p>I supposed that he had left without bidding me good night, during my colloquy with Mr. Prime.</p> 
               <p>It was a slight surprise to hear his voice and find him sitting in my favorite recess. The bright moon shone through the vine-screened casement, casting flickering lights and shadows upon the white floor.</p> 
               <p>The serene beauty of the still August night fell peacefully into my perturbed spirit, and with a sigh of relief, I sank into the chair the gentleman handed. Standing opposite, leaning against the chimney-piece, he gazed into my face a moment in silence, then said, "Cousin James has been unwarrantably harsh, and unreasonable with his ward to-night."</p> 
               <p>"You heard the conversation?"</p> 
               <p>"It was unavoidable."</p> 
               <p>"You think I ought to have the money?"</p> 
               <p>"Certainly. It was not a large sum for a lady of your fortune to require, and your feelings and those of your old friend were entitled to consideration."</p> 
               <p>"The Primes will never forgive me. I was in hopes Genevieve would interpose, but her husband is considered infallible."</p> 
               <p>My companion smiled. "That is the true wifely instinct, isn't it, Jessie?"</p> 
               <p>I laughingly replied, "That I feared I should be only too alive to my husband's faults if I had the misfortune to possess one."</p> 
               <p>"Dwight would tell you that that was a wicked speech, Miss Wisdom; but I believe you judge your selfrightly. You will never render a blind homage. For that reason your love is worth the winning; it ennobles its recipient. This reminds me that I desired to ask your explanation of the verse, 'For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.'"</p> 
               <p>Mr. Raymond had often asked me to expound Scripture texts, but he cavilled so much that I refused to discuss with him. I therefore replied, "You know that I dislike to enter upon the topic. I have done my duty towards you, henceforth you must work out your own salvation."</p> 
               <p>"I am fully aware of that, but still must urge my request. Just give me an idea how you understand it."</p> 
               <p>"I scarcely think I shall be comprehended by one who does not recognize a soul and a future life."</p> 
               <p>"Those points are conceded. Please go on; are the husbands and wives separated?"</p> 
               <p>"That must depend upon the nature of their union. If it is internal as<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6399-00000087"/> well as external, of the spirit as well as of the body, nothing can separate them. Here we lead a comparatively j external existence; hereafter it must be wholly internal. Jesus tells us that the kingdom of Heaven is within; if the married pair have entered this kingdom here, and their souls are truly united, they must together enter the Heavenly eternity, there to become angels of God."</p> 
               <p>"Jessie, I am afraid these spiritual marriages are rare!"</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps so, but there is such a thing as true marriage nevertheless. It is a divine institution; man has desecrated it; but it is no less of the divine. If the secrets of all hearts were disclosed, we should see that a true union of spirit is no rare thing. Many are the husbands and wives that the world has severed. They may scarcely know each other, they may be separated for years, in the world's eye, and in their own; they may be husbands and wives of others, but in reality they belong to each other. God has united them, man cannot put them asunder"</p> 
               <p>A quiet thoughtfulness had been stealing over Mr. Raymond's countenance, as I spoke, which deepened into solemnity. There was a pause, while he stood in meditation with downcast eyes. At length they were raised to mine, beaming with a glow that I had never seen before. "Jessie," he exclaimed in a low, deep tone, "Through one woman my faith was lost; it is but right that through another it should be restored. For months I have known that you was my comforter, now I clearly see that you are a God-given evangel."</p> 
               <p>Raising my hand to his lips, with a murmured blessing, and good night, he passed over the low window sill, and mounting his horse, rode slowly away.</p> 
               <p>As I stood listening to the retreating hoofs, I espied Dwight rise from the opposite bank. He had evidently been watching Mr. Raymond's departure. For a moment, he stood as though uncertain which way to turn, then with loitering gait sauntered up the hill.</p> 
               <p>I ran to my room to watch his motions; to my dismay, he disappeared within the old meeting-house. I had never become divested of the dread inspired by his fondness for these nocturnal freaks; to-night it came in full force.</p> 
               <p>Sinking beside the casement, I wiated his return. Twelve, one, struck. I had worked myself into a state bordering on frenzy, when his figure emerged from the shadow. There was a slight pause before my window,-but I had withdrawn from view,-then he paced slowly down the hill. I watched till he disappeared within the door at the master's, then sought my pillow.</p> 
               <p>It seemed as if I had only just fallen asleep, when I was aroused by the entrance of Peggy. Dawn was breaking, I asked what was wanted.</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Raymond wants to know if you and Mrs. Lee are going to take yer morning ride?"</p> 
               <p>I then recollected that we had promised to accompany Mr. Raymond to watch the sun rising from a neighboring eminence, Springing up, I bade Peggy call Genevieve and James. I would be down directly.</p> 
               <p>To my chagrin, I found Genevieve declined going.</p> 
               <p>If she went whortleberrying it would be too much fatigue. I had avoided riding and walking alone with Raymond, but my habit was on, my horse at the door, I felt that it would look over-prudish to decline then, and give matters the aspect I was anxious to avoid, Go I must, and trust to my mother-wit to avert any denouement. James' evident delight at the turn affairs had taken raised my ire. Why was he desirous I should marry Mr. Raymond? Certain that gentleman was too honorable to take any undue advantage, top kind to press his attentions if not acceptable, I rode silently, almost sullenly, down the hill by his side.</p> 
               <p>As we reached the master's, I glanced to Dwight's room at the instant he approached a window. Did that fierce, almost fiendish look, belong to the sunny-faced friend of my childhood? Full of past memories and present anxieties, I rode on, too busy with thoughts for words. Mr. Raymond was equally taciturn. Only by a slight look or attention was my presence recognized.</p> 
               <p>As we reached our destination, the sun burst from its canopy of amber, amethyst and ruby, and sailed up into the blue translucence, scattering a long line of glittering gold upon his ocean couch.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Raymond reverently raised his hat over his bowed head. Instinctively I knew that a prayer was in his soul. The tears rushed to my eyes; how humbled, how inferior I felt! Petty discords and worldly cares should no longer dim my vision, vex my heart.</p> 
               <p>My companion turned, his eyes lowered mine, "Jessie you are ill." The tender tone gave a strange thrill; with difficulty, I replied, "that my head ached slightly."</p> 
               <p>"I saw you were pale when you came out; I ought not to have permitted you to accompany me, but I was selfish, I could not forego the delight of having you all to myself, even if it was but for a poor, little half hour, Jessie. Selfishness is a characteristic of man, as you women often find to your cost, but never fear to set the bounds to mine. Let me turn your horse, the glare is to much for those heavy eyes."</p> 
               <p>Holding my bridle, he led the way down the steep declivity. The wood path below was still dim with early shadows, the dew sparkled on leaf and spray, and gemmed the fairy webs on the grassy banks, the air was redolent with fragrance, and musical with the matin lays of its feathered denizens. Mr. Raymond glanced around, above, drew a long, deep breath, then turning to me with soul beaming eyes, he exclaimed, "Oh, Jessie, I have been blind for a season, but now I see. Like the chosen disciples, this night I have been permitted to ascend the mount of Transfiguration. Life will bring its shadows, but henceforth it must be like yonder cloud, whose dark folds are becoming so luminous in the rising sunbeams. Thus the Son of Righteousness lights the darkness of this world."</p> 
               <p>I essayed to speak, but voice was wanting; I could only extend my hand. It was seized and pressed, in both of his. Hastily withdrawing it, I quickened my horse's pace.</p> 
               <p>Though my eyes sought everything but his face, I knew that my companion's searching gaze was upon me. There was a short pause; then he inquired: "What was my haste?"</p> 
               <p>"Aunt Compton would be waiting breakfast," His horse received a tap from his riding-whip, and we cantered forward in silence, till a splendid display of wild roses brought us to a sudden halt. The gentleman rode beneath the overhanging bank, and standing on the stirrups, bent down a branch and severed a spray, which he brought to me.</p> 
               <p>"You were talking of plumes the other day; this is the prettiest plume for this season"; bending forward, he tucked the stem beneath the band of my beaver. As the dewy spray fell over my cheek, he took a silver paper from his pocket; unwrapping it, a long, silken tress of rippling gold fell from its coil.</p> 
               <p>"What beautiful hair!" burst from my lips.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Raymond smiled, and as he held<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6399-00000088"/> it against my raven curls, replied: "If the one upon whose head it grew had possessed your disposition, Jessie, I had never become the manner of man I have been. Do not understand me to blame her; but, unfortunately, she put the Mosaic law before that of Christ, Obeyed the commandment to 'Honor father and mother,' forgetting that Christ had also commanded the twain to become one. You would have clung to the poor sailor-boy. If you had loved as she loved, nothing earthly could have sundered you from him."</p> 
               <p>"I-do-not-know, but she-You became rich too late?"</p> 
               <p>"Too late! My Nelly had been a wedded wife one short month when the only impediment to our union was removed. My parents had died in abject want; I had been cast penniless and friendless upon the wide world. From the lack of a little yellow dross, I had lost all that made life desirable; then it came in a shower. I was not, could not be thankful. A few years previous it would have prevented so much misery; then it was refused with maledictions. How could I thank the miserly wretch whom death alone could render just? Though not grateful for this wealth, I determined to make it a means of usefulness, but how could I fail to be miserable? You and others have thought me morbidly selfish, but I have not grieved for myself alone. Another's life was blighted. Her husband is not a good man, though he is a rich one. She has had much to endure, but she knew where to find consolation. Women naturally are more religious than men. What turns woman to her Maker, often only hardens the sterner sex. She has another comforter, a sweet little girl, a blue-eyed little angel, the exact counterpart of her mother."</p> 
               <p>I looked my farther curiosity; we were emerging from the wood, "Another time you shall hear every particular, Jessie." As Mr. Raymond spoke, we came suddenly upon Dwight; perceiving us, he wheeled about and leaped the wall to the right. I called to him, but receiving no reply, turned appealingly to my companion. His face grew grave, almost stern; there was a moment's hesitation, a moment's struggle, then the low barrier was cleared, and riding up to the young artist he flung himself from his horse, and stood beside him. There was a quick interchange of words. Mr. Raymond extended his hand,-a slight pause-then Dwight raised his bowed head, and placed his within it,-a short colloquy; then the two turned and came towards me, Mr. Raymond, with his horse's bridle hanging over his arm, and Dwight's sketchbook in his hand, the younger man evidently explaining the drawings.</p> 
               <p>As Dwight drew near, I saw that the evil spirit was laid, but how unlike was that pale, thin face, with the dark circles and curves, to the careless, good humored visage I loved to remember. "What is your will, Sylvia, Queen of Roses?" was the jocular salutation, as with a low bow he approached and stood beside me.</p> 
               <p>"I wished to talk over the afternoon's arrangement," I returned, as I twisted off a rose sprig, and stooping, twined it in his button-hole.</p> 
               <p>A slight color mounted to his cheek, raising his eyes, deep, soft, lustrous, he said, "I will drive you over to Ruthy's, by-and-by."</p> 
               <p>I explained that he would take Genevieve, but that I should accompany the others in the wagon from the Squire's.</p> 
               <p>"Very well, I will come in after breakfast and complete the arrangements with Mrs. Lee. Now I suppose the old girls are expecting me." With a bow to Mr. Raymond, he bade us a smiling good morning.</p> 
               <p>Neither spoke, as we proceeded up the hill, but as we turned into the yard, I invited Mr. Raymond to come in and take breakfast.</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, not this morning, Jessie."</p> 
               <p>We stopped before the back entrance to the hall. No one was in sight; hastily running his eye over the tiers of windows, he lifted me lightly from the saddle. For an instant I was held in a firm embrace, then placed gently upon the ground; with his arms still around me, in a low, ever-to-be-remembered tone, he murmured, "Jessie, last night you taught me that our spirits can never be very far apart, though stronger bonds may intervene. Judge me as leniently as you can, and give me all the heart you have to spare."</p> 
               <p>Pressing his lips hastily to my brow, he sprang upon his horse, and rode away without another word or look.</p>

               <p>THE family were still at the breakfast table. Aunt Compton, with a scrutinizing glance, objected to my absence from morning prayer.</p> 
               <p>"Don't chide, madam," James quizzingly interposed. "Little doubt but there has been plenty of devotion during this matin gallop."</p> 
               <p>My nerves were too unstrung for my usual self command,-tears rushed to my eyes.</p> 
               <p>Genevieve glanced reprovingly at her husband, and asked if I had seen Dwight.</p> 
               <p>"Yes. He would come in directly."</p> 
               <p>James enjoined his wife to unite in the excursion. "It would do her good." Turning, he added, "Jessie, if it is your wish, I will bring that money for old Prime."</p> 
               <p>"I did not like to incommode him, but it would gratify me to make the loan to an old neighbor."</p> 
               <p>"Very well," and with a kiss to wife and babe, he hurried away.</p> 
               <p>At ten o'clock, Dwight took Genevieve, her infant and nurse to Mrs. Osborn's. We all went to assist them to the chaise. Genevieve rode away, looking back and nodding a smiling farewell as they descended the hill.</p> 
               <p>It was the Saturday's baking; the huge oven reeked with flame. Bread and pies crowded the great kitchen table.</p> 
               <p>I began to beat eggs for a loaf of cake, which I designed to take for the afternoon's luncheon; but nothing went right. I spilled the egg, mistook in the quantity of sugar, and finally capped the climax by upsetting a pitcher of milk into the flour box.</p> 
               <p>Peggy declared I was no force! "She raly believed I was getting in love, but if I give Dwight the mitten, she'd sartinly cut me off with a shilling in her will. Mr. Raymond was a fine, noble gentleman, still he could not compare to Dwight."</p> 
               <p>Fairly driven from the kitchen, I went to my room and commenced preparations for the pleasure-party, but my ill luck continued. Everything combined at cross purposes.</p> 
               <p>Dinner over, I began to dress; still my progress was retarded; buttons came off, strings knotted and broke; I thought I never should be ready; meantime, a dull, leaden weight settled over my limbs; it was with difficulty that I lifted my feet.</p> 
               <p>The clock struck one. I saw that Dwight was waiting to accompany me to the Squire's, whence we were to ride with the rest of the party, in a large wagon, to the river.</p> 
               <p>Throwing a shawl over my shoulders, I snatched up my sun-bonnet. "Stop!" wailed a Voice in my ear.</p> 
               <p>With an electric start, I wheeled<pb n="168" xml:id="VAC6399-00000089"/> round, and stared about. No one was there. Had my aunt spoken? Was it Peggy?</p> 
               <p>In a strange quiver, I dragged my benumbed feet down the stairs, and peeped into the sitting-room. Aunt Compton was nodding in her easy-chair, while Peggy's voice, humming "Robert Kidd," droned from the distant dairy.</p> 
               <p>This must have been a fancy! Still, to be satisfied, I looked into both parlor and library; the two rooms bore their usual quiet aspect. With an effort, I lifted my basket, well stored with Peggy's viands, from the hall table, and advanced to the front door. My hand was upon the latch, when that thrilling, authoritative "Stop!" again sounded in my ear.</p> 
               <p>Sinking against the door, I gazed affrightedly through the empty vista of the long passage. Nothing was there except the summer flies circling through the cool, shady space; no sound broke the stillness save their drowsy hum, mingled with the muffled refrain of Peggy's song. Suddenly, I recalled Aunt Compton's story of the warning she had received not to attend White-field's preaching.</p> 
               <p>Impatiently uttering a forcible malediction on my nervous foolishness, I turned, and, with renewed firmness, walked down the gravel walk. Dwight came forward to meet me. My hand was upon the gate, when an irresistible, though gentle force, pressed me back, and that imperative "<emph>Stop!</emph>" again thrilled upon my ear.</p> 
               <p>Completely unnerved, wholly overpowered, I sank helplessly upon the grass. Dwight sprang forward with eager inquiries; I gazed wildly into his face, and whispered, "Who pushed me back, who told me to stop?"</p> 
               <p>My companion returned my gaze in bewildered wonderment. "Pushed you back, told you to stop! What are you talking about, Jessie?"</p> 
               <p>"I don't know," I replied, with another searching look round me. "Three times a spectral voice has bid me stop!"</p> 
               <p>For an instant the young man's eyes remained fixed on mine with their former serious questioning, then they changed to a merry twinkle, while with one of his musical laughs, he exclaimed, "Why, Jessie, we shall have to inaugurate you with the 'Goody's' broomstick! I can't divine witches, but it must be more of an angel than devil, if the voice told you to stop, for you are too ill to proceed. Morning rides will never agree with you, Miss Wisdom."</p> 
               <p>"I shall not take another."</p> 
               <p>"A most sage conclusion, worthy of our Minervean goddess. Take my arm. Why, you can scarcely stand! This afternoon must be devoted to rest; I will make your excuses, and Raymond and I will supply your quota of berries; it is n't every girl that has two such purveyors."</p> 
               <p>I smiled, and handing Dwight my basket, bade him "Hasten; the party would be waiting for him; I was myself now, and could get into the house without help."</p> 
               <p>"Was I sure? Then would I take Turk with me; he was unwieldy for a boat."</p> 
               <p>For the first time, the dog refused obedience. It required all his master's authority, and my ability at coaxing, to secure his compliance. At length, with a rueful, discontented expression, he crouched slowly forward. Dwight ran down the road, and I returned to the house, and accompanied by Turk, ascended to my room, when I gladly threw my weary frame upon the bed. Turk laid down beneath it. My aunt learning that I had come back with a headache, affectionately bathed my forehead,

                   and having darkened the windows, left me to the repose that was so grateful.</p> 
               <p>I was aroused by a loud peal of thunder. Starting up with that peculiar sensation of undefined dread that had accompanied me since the preceding night, I drew aside the curtain.</p> 
               <p>A dense, black cloud overspread the western sky; its white, turgid vanguard surging rapidly towards the zenith; vivid flashes rent the sable folds, and huge drops of rain, mingled with hail, pattered against the panes; the motionless leaves began to rustle, while the wind swept forward with that hollow, rushing sound, that betokens an approaching tempest.</p> 
               <p>Turk had started at the first alarm; having shared my rapid glance from the window, he ran to the door with a low whine; I followed, and met my aunt and Peggy upon the threshold. A blinding glare, a terrific crash, and a blast that shook the large, stanch house to its foundation, rooted us for a moment to the spot. Peal succeeded peal, while rain and hail dashed in torrents over the casements, completely blinding outward view.</p> 
               <p>With white faces, we gazed tremblingly into each other's eyes, while "The boat!" escaped from each quivering lip.</p> 
               <p>"They will all get their death of cold!" exclaimed Peggy. "It will be the eend of Miss Lee; she never can stand this drenching."</p> 
               <p>Aunt Compton trusted that they had seen the approaching storm in season to reach Ruthy's. "Little chance of it," returned Peggy; "they'd be busy berrying, and the hills hide so, the shower would be jest upon 'em afore they seed it. Well, it can't be helped now; what is to be, will be I s'pose. But quick up, quick over! See! its passing away! Look at that line of light, and the wind don't blow much now; 'twont rain many minutes longer. Do let that dog out, Jessie, he'll scratch the door down!"</p> 
               <p>I ran below, and opened the hall door. Turk bounded forth. As he did so, Peggy threw up the sash, with the exclamation, "Now don't tell me dogs don't know as much as human critters! See that fellow leg it for the river! Now how do you s'pose he knew where Dwight had gone, if he don't understand our talk?"</p> 
               <p>Watching the beast, with that undefined dread growing stronger and stronger, I espied a man running down a hill that intervened between us and the water. Stepping upon the door-stone, I looked up to Peggy, and asked who it was.</p> 
               <p>"Crazy Turner. Mercy, how he is tossing his arms and screaming!"</p> 
               <p>At an inconceivable speed, the insane creature rushed forward In a direct line for the parsonage. As he advanced, the wild shouts formed themselves into the deepest expressions of woe. A terrible dread clutched my heart! Rushing across the wet grass, I met him as he leaped the garden wall. At sight of me he stopped, throwing his arms above his head, in a voice, whose tragic awfulness still thrills my nerves at the recollection, he shouted:</p> 
               <p>"How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is she become a widow! She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks; among all her lovers, she hath none to comfort her."</p> 
               <p>With a spasmodic effort for speech, I grasped the maniac's sleeve, but with a howl of despair he wrenched it loose, and sprang away screeching, "Woe, woe! the heavens were darkened, the earth shook, the waters swallowed them! Woe-woe-woe! Among all her lovers, she has none to comfort her!"</p> 
               <p>I have but a slight knowledge of what followed,-only a vague remembrance<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6399-00000091"/> brance of running to the stable and leading Jenny from her stall. I can recall nay aunt's and Peggy's scared faces, and urgent appeals that I should wait for Job, as I mounted her, and snatched the sun-bonnet my aunt thrust into my hand. Afterwards, I recalled her earnest entreaty not to thus heed crazy man's words,-then it had no power. Wild waters were around me; a strange gurgling was in my ears; a sinking boat was before my eyes. My steed was mettlesome; I put her to her swiftest pace. Men threw down their tools and ran to the road-side, women and children sprang to doors and windows, dogs barked and people shouted, as I sped on the headlong race. I raised the whole country-side, but was completely oblivious myself. Still that rushing water-that sinking boat-and <emph>one</emph> form cold and stark. Seven human beings had embarked; only <emph>one</emph> was thought of at that hour! The vail was rent, the heart lay bare,-one form lay before me, breathless, soulless,-beyond, around, stretched a void-darkness-desperation!</p> 
               <p>Onward, still onward, with the fleet-ness of the wind. The main road was passed, the river road gained. Faster, faster! Goody Sloper, with dripping garments and streaming hair, seized my bridle. I was at my goal. Following the direction to which the gleaming eyes and long, bony finger of the witch pointed, I entered the open door and stood within the kitchen. Before a huge blaze sat Dwight with a corpse-like face, while Polly, surreunded by a bevy of women, reclined upon blankets on the other side of the hearth. For the first time in my life, I fainted and fell. Returning consciousness told me that I was supported in those arms that I had pictured stiff in death. I was in my cousin's bedroom; a crowd thronged that and the adjoining kitchen. Suddenly, Dwight and I were left alone; the intervening door was hastily closed; there was a confused murmur, the tread of many feet, followed by a deep hush, in which came the dull sound of some object placed upon the floor, Then rose a long, low, simultaneous wail.</p> 
               <p>Starting up, I gazed at my companion. "Dwight, you and Polly-where are the others?"</p> 
               <p>The young man turned his face from me, and groaned in agony. I sprang from the couch on which I had been laid; Dwight grasped my hand. "God knows I tried to save. Oh, Jessie, Raymond was a better swimmer than I."</p> 
               <p>I could not stop for words; unclosing the door, I pushed through the sobbing crowd, and sank beside the lifeless form of my more than sister, my idolized Genevieve. Turk, with dripping coat, lapped the cold hand. The tearful agony throughout the room redoubled.</p> 
               <p>"What were they doing? Why did they not strive to bring back life? Take her nearer the fire; heat blankets, rub her, get something hot; quick, quick!"</p> 
               <p>Eye glanced to eye, gestures of despair passed around, but my behests were obeyed,-obeyed till I was compelled to acknowledge them futile. Yes, our darling, our pride and love was gone from us! Three others besides, lay in the next room; the fourth, that of Mr. Raymond, had, just been drawn from the water.</p> 
               <p>The Nortons and Primes had come. It was whispered that Mr. Sprague had arrived The dead were to be taken home! Oh, mockery! what homes had they become! I turned for Dwight, With a ghastly face, he answered my summons.</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Raymond must be taken to the parsonage; Peggy goes with Genevieve's corpse; can you see to it? I must speak to your uncle; have you seen him?"</p> 
                
               <p>"What uncle?" demanded the young man, with a vacant stare.</p> 
               <p>The master laid his hand upon my shoulder. "I will attend to your wishes, Jessie. Dwight, my sisters are waiting for you." As he spoke, Aunt Judy took Dwight's arm, and leading him to the wagon, they drove away.</p> 
               <p>The master met my affrighted look. "It is the shock! Judy will soon bring him round."</p> 
               <p>The shock! What was to become of James? Glancing through a window, I saw that the sun was setting; he must be on the way home. "Oh James," I murmured, "some one ought to ride forward to meet him."-"Bless you, Jessie, for such thoughtfulness. I will set out instantly."</p> 
               <p>I looked up; Uncle Sam stood beside me. "Go," was all that I could gasp. As I extended my hand, he raised it to his lips, whispering, "Remember that God is still above, dear Jessie."</p> 
               <p>Polly, with her spirit face, begged me to persuade the Goody to change her clothes.</p> 
               <p>"She'll mind you."</p> 
               <p>"How came they wet?" I asked, as I followed my friend to the bedroom.</p> 
               <p>"Why, don't you know that she saved both Dwight and myself?"</p> 
               <p>"No. How did it happen? Why did you try to come back when the shower was so close upon you?"</p> 
               <p>"I scarcely know,-the storm came up like a flash. Dwight and Mr. Raymond hesitated slightly, when we were stepping into the boat, but William Norton was certain we could get across before the rain would come. We were midway the river when the tempest burst upon us. I only know there was a fearful rush and roar; I was in the water. Dwight seized me. I cannot tell anything more, only I heard the Goody's voice; the next of which I was conscious, I was lying on the river bank, supported by Mrs. Osborn."</p> 
               <p>I turned to the Goody, and handed her one of Ruthy's gowns. She took it and answered the inquiry I had looked.</p> 
               <p>"I was berryin' this side and I seed 'em; I knowed their peril and watched. I see that two were swimming this way, the others went right down, I think. Perhaps the women bore the other two men down; they were both swimmers; but I only see the two making to this shore. I see that the man was giving out. I was a Joppa gal, and used to swim, so I jest tucked up my clothes, and waded in; but I had to strike out; it's well I am strong, or we should have all gone to the bottom together."</p> 
               <p>Polly threw her arms about the Goody's neck and kissed her. I wrapped a shawl around the shivering woman, and bade her hasten home.</p> 
               <p>For the first time, I thought of the baby. "Where was she?"</p> 
               <p>"Above stairs with her nurse." The little creature stretched forth her hands with an appealing cry at my approach. I snatched her in my arms, and drew her to my bosom. Dear, motherless babe! but motherless only in name; henceforth. I must fill the place of her that had gone! As far as it was possible, the sweet infant should never know her loss.</p> 
               <p>Aunt Compton displayed the composure I had anticipated. None but myself were cognizant of the emotion with which God was thanked for preserving me to her old age, as I was folded in a strong, though tremulous Clasp to; her heart. Her words first recalled the mysterious event that had kept me from joining the party. Was this a divine interposition? I could not doubt it, but with awe, bowed before the recognition! Yes; I had been saved! Why, oh why? An inward voice uttered, "To work the Father's will, to comfort and keep those that remain." With an invocation for strength<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6399-00000092"/> in my weakness, I meekly went forth to do its bidding.</p> 
               <p>The house was thronged. Disputes and dissensions alike forgotten; human brotherhood asserted full sway. Arminianism and Hopkinsianism, Federalism and Democracy were alike forgotten. Neighbors who had not spoken for months, worked side by side in the most amicable manner. The strict Parson Kirkwood and the free-thinking master vied with each other in performing the last offices to the manes of one whom they had equally professed to dislike and disapprove. The rigid Calvinistic Madam Kirkwood, upon finding a small gold crucifix in Genevieve's bosom, came to ask for a bit of ribbon, in order to again suspend it round her neck.</p> 
               <p>"Doubtless it was a souvenir," she explained. "Mrs. Lee died with it resting against her heart; let it be buried there."</p> 
               <p>Blessing the thoughtful kindness of the staid Puritan matron, I procured the ribbon. Dear Genevieve, why should we selfishly mourn? She had gone to her own!</p> 
               <p>Our dead lay in peaceful serenity. One in the chamber she had so recently quitted, full of life and hope; the other, in the apartment where the previous evening he had caught his first glimpse of that eternity now stretching in unbounded vision. The twilight was deepening. Dwight, with his pale face and wild eyes, crept into the hall; a low, anxious whisper circled from one to another: James had come. Dwight rose, reeled to the door, then sank into a seat in the obscurity. Uncle Sam held the bridle of James' horse, as he came slowly and heavily to the ground. The weight of years appeared to have momently fallen upon him. With a slow, uncertain step, he advanced, and stood in the entrance.</p> 
               <p>Dwight crouched back; I went forward and clasped my cousin's hands.</p> 
               <p>The stupid, immobile look changed into one of agony. "Oh, Jessie, where have you put her?" I pointed above. With a quickened pace he ascended the stairs; the women moved aside; the bereaved man was alone with his dead!</p> 
               <p>My aunt's equanimity was sustained till the arrival of Aunt Rutledge and her daughter, then she broke down entirely. It required strong efforts to bring her from the death-like swoon which followed the meeting.</p> 
               <p>The weather was so warm that it was necessary to make immediate preparations for burial. Such haste seemed terrible, but it was imperative. While my aunts were taking the measure for Genevieve's robe, James stepped into my room.</p> 
               <p>Addy had been brought home; I was undressing her. At sight of her father, she nearly sprang from my lap, with a joyous shout. The stricken man took his motherless babe, and bowing his face upon her little figure, wept as only a strong man can weep.</p> 
               <p>I blessed God for these tears. If I could have seen Dwight thus overcome,-if I could have shed one tear myself, what a boon it would have been! The house was once more quiet. Aunt Judy had prevailed upon Dwight to go home with her; James had returned to his wife's side; nurse and baby were asleep; Aunt Compton had been assisted to bed, and Peggy had been coaxed into following her example.</p> 
               <p>No sound broke the stillness save the low murmur of voices from the parlor, where my aunts, Ruthy and Mira, were busy over the shrouds.</p> 
               <p>In conformity to their desire, I also withdrew to my room, and threw myself upon the bed. How could I bear the grief! I tried to think, I tried to pray,-I could do neither. It was a clear, soft, solemn summer night, the moonlight fell in shimmering beams through the large elms that sighed softly in the slight, night breeze, the crickets and grasshoppers chirped their monotonous refrain, James' footsteps fell regularly upon the ear, as he paced to and fro.</p> 
               <p>My heart was bursting, my brain on lire. Taking the candle, I tiptoed down to the library; Job was nodding in the study-chair. Whispering him to lie down a while on the kitchen settle, I walked up the large, dim apartment. In the centre, stretched upon the table in the cold rigidity of death, lay the noble form that the previous night had stood beside me in yonder nook! Timidly, I advanced-slowly I drew aside the covering. Oh, how noble, how majestically beautiful was that dead face! The light that had flashed over it as that morning dawned still rested there; the whole expression betokened a glimpse of heavenly joy ere the eyes closed on earthly sorrow.</p> 
               <p>As I gazed, how the varied events of the past few months rushed to mind. Looks, words and tones, at the time unheeded, returned, never again to be effaced from memory. How vividly rose the occurrences of the last evening and of that morning's ride! How cold, how unsympathetic I had been! More confidence might have been given where confidence would never have been abused or unappreciated. I had intended to speak more freely another time. Another time! Deluded mortal! the present is the only time which thou canst count as thy possession! Do thy work while it is day, for the night is at hand! Oh, that I could have roused that inanimated form! that I could have unsealed those eyes, opened those ears, even for one poor five minutes, what comfort, what unspeakable comfort, it would have been! Never, again to gaze into the unfathomable depths of those eyes, never again to hear the rich tones of that voice! Those last words rang in my ears, that first and last kiss was on my brow! Nevermore-nevermore! With a cry of anguish, I sank upon the floor, and burying my face in the winding sheet, gave vent to these overcharged feelings in moans and hysteric sobs.</p> 
               <p>An icy hand was laid on mine. "Don't, Jessie, don't," gasped a sepulchral voice. I looked up. Dwight was bending over me. I could neither speak nor move, but gazed helplessly into his ghastly face.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, God, what can I do?" he continued, in frenzied accents. "This morning I wished that man was dead; yes, dead! At heart, for one moment, I was a murderer! But, Jessie, God and all holy angels be my witness, if now the forfeit of my life would restore his, I would willingly exchange places, would gladly, joyfully, accept the grave, if thereby I could restore this loved one to your arms."</p> 
               <p>What could I, what ought I to say? Slowly rising, I clasped my hands over the young man's arm. Timidly raising my eyes to his wild and glassy ones, I murmured, "Dwight this is terrible, very terrible; almost too much for my weak humanity to sustain, but <emph>you</emph> are alive; <emph>you</emph> are with me; it can be borne."</p> 
               <p>Not a muscle changed, but the eyes as they gazed back into mine, gradually softened. Drawing me to him, he bent over the dead, whispering, "Jessie, you ought to have loved him best; he was the most worthy." Stooping, he pressed his lips to the marble brow, then motioned me to do the same. The compact was sealed; thereafter, we had a brother in heaven!</p> 
               <p>James next came below. Feeling that it was best to leave him alone with Dwight, Ruthy and I repaired above to finish our vigil beside the loved form that was so soon to be shut from our eyes forever.</p>

               <head type="sub">DUST TO DUST.</head> 
               <p>OUR stricken family were assembled for the usual morning worship. James opened the sacred volume; he had been the reader since his stay at the parsonage; his quivering lips essayed utterance, but the effort was vain. Hastily rising he retreated from the circle, and buried his face in his hands. No one volunteered to fill his place. Aunt Compton closed the Bible, and bent her head upon it. In a silence, broken by sobs, our orisons went up to Him, who alone can comfort the riven heart.</p> 
               <p>Breakfast was served. How forcibly it brought back the light-hearted meal of the yestermorn! Should we ever wish to eat again?</p> 
               <p>Parson Kirk wood, the master, and Lieut. Brown, came to make arrangements for the burial. It had been decided to have the service over the four in our parish, performed in the meeting-house, at three o'clock. Miss Sprague was to be buried from her father's house, an hour earlier. Though the funeral was to be strictly private, Polly and I received an invitation to attend.</p> 
               <p>Polly had stolen in, still looking more like a spirit than a living being. As she entered, James turned and extended his hand. For an instant, the poor girl was completely overcome, then she murmured, "Oh, Mr. Lee, it seems a sin for me to be alive."</p> 
               <p>"Call It rather a Divine Providence, dear Polly; it has been ordered aright."</p> 
               <p>Never shall I forget the expression of my friend's speaking countenance, as she took Addy from my arms and sank into a seat.</p> 
               <p>"Polly," I whispered, "you do not think of going to Sprague Place?"</p> 
               <p>"I scarcely think I have sufficient strength," she replied.</p> 
               <p>"Must I go?" I turned to Dwight.</p> 
               <p>"It would be a consolation to him to have me with him; if it was not too much exertion he hoped I would do so."</p> 
               <p>I felt that his desires ought to govern mine; my feelings ought to be subservient to his comfort; consequently I signified my acquiescence.</p> 
               <p>Upon hearing it, Aunt Nabby began to be greatly concerned respecting my dress. "You have a black gownd," said she, "and your aunt can lend you a scarf, but where to git a bunnet! I mentioned it to Miss Rutledge last night, and we couldn't think of one we could bony nowheres round."</p> 
               <p>Since Grandsir's funeral I had had my own ideas regarding undue trouble in such matters at such a season; now, the very thought of dress was so repulsive, I hastily replied, "There is no occasion to borrow; my straw is plain and trimmed with white; I will throw a black veil over it."</p> 
               <p>Aunt Nabby glanced round the little circle with a look of horror, "Poor child," she exclaimed, with a sigh. "You are quite beside yourself, Wear white at a funeral? why people would take you for a Quaker!"</p> 
               <p>"That would be of little consequence, Aunt Nabby. It is convenient to wear the white to-day, and in reality it is more suitable, as it is a type of that eternal life into which our departed have entered. Let me wear the symbol of my faith, and do not disturb the solemn calm of this hour by unnecessary bustle or parade."</p> 
               <p>A meaning glance silently passed round the group. Aunt Nabby was about to resume, when James hurriedly interposed, "Let her be, Aunt Nabby; her theory, though novel, is correct; she will dress appropriately; do not trouble her."</p> 
               <p>Aunt Nabby turned reluctantly away, muttering something about town's talk, and folks setting themselves above time-honored observances and customs. James and Dwight, accompanied by the sexton, next repaired to the burying-ground by the river side. Our dead were to lie, as they had stood, side by side, on the spot they themselves had so recently chosen.</p> 
               <p>Looking back, how clearly the Hand of the Deity could be discerned! How surely had it been manifested tending to this one point! With this Providence watching and guiding, why should we rebel and repine. The infant resists the parent whose tender heart and hand alone seeks its happiness and advantage; what were we but infants in the hand of a Heavenly Father? let us wait and trust. Now "we saw but darkly," but in a little while-only a little while-we should "see face to face."</p> 
               <p>At twelve o'clock, the carriage came to take Dwight and myself to Sprague Place. The stately mansion wore all the outward insignia of woe. The house-servants and farm-laborers were assembled in the darkened hall; a small company of relatives and friends had gathered around the bereaved parents in the summer parlor; in the front drawing-room, surrounded by all the pomp that the richest funeral display could give, lay the poor remains of her who so recently had held imperious sway within those walls, the proud daughter of a haughty race.</p> 
               <p>Miss Kate Donaldson came to meet us. With her wonted kindness, she had immediately hastened to the support and assistance of her stricken friends. Mr. Sprague also stepped forward. It was the first time uncle and nephew had met since the accident. Dwight stretched forth his trembling hand and faltered forth: "I tried to save her, uncle. I would have died to do so."</p> 
               <p>The wiry muscles of his relative's stern, stolid countenance twitched convulsively. Spasmodically compressing the thin lips for a moment, he regarded his nephew in silence, then in a low, severe monotone, replied: "I doubt it not; the fault was at the beginning. No one excepting the most inexperienced or heedless would have thought of embarking at such a moment."</p> 
               <p>Poor Dwight! It was pitiful to witness the crushing effect of this speech! Without a word of explanation or extenuation, he turned and walked up to his aunt, who was moaning amid her cushions at the other end of the room. I followed, knowing, for I had gathered every particular from Polly, that Miss Sprague, who was timid in a thunder-shower, had been unalterable in her determination to trust to the chance of a mishap on the river rather than remain during the storm in a shelterless pasture.</p> 
               <p>Madam Sprague's reception was characterized by her usual combination of fretful kindliness. "I'm glad you were spared, Dwight," she moaned between her sobs, "but I can't conceive why this judgment is sent upon us! Why must our daughter be taken in her youth, and, owing to her sister's marriage, just when we most needed her? It seems like a dream. I can't realize that she is there in that coffin! Oh, Jessie; you did not go! It was a great mercy. I am glad anybody is alive; but it does seem as if that Brown girl would have been less missed than my Arabella."</p> 
               <p>I could forgive this selfish outburst, could appreciate the openness that thus outspoke what many another has felt, without having the grace to acknowledge even to themselves.</p> 
               <p>Dwight, at that moment, had lost the power to analyze; he could only feel. With ah expression depicting both horror and disgust, he turned away.</p> 
               <p>The rector from St. Paul's church,<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6399-00000094"/> in town at Madam Sprague's request, first read the Episcopal burial service. This was followed by an extemporaneous prayer by Dr. Parkinson. The mourners then formed in procession, and followed the corpse to a new tomb, just completed for the family burial-place in the churchyard.</p> 
               <p>Dwight and I were obliged to leave immediately. Dr. Parkinson and Miss Kate accompanied us. The four corpses had already been conveyed to the meeting-house when we arrived. A crowd was about the doors, but only the near relatives and friends had been permitted to enter. The coffins stood before the pulpit. Those of Mrs. Lee and Debby Prime in the centre; Mr. Raymond's to the right, beside Genevieve, and William Norton's to the left.</p> 
               <p>An express had summoned Mr. Nugent. Never was more sincere grief evinced than that shown by this debased man; the memory of that hour, subsequently enabled me to pity, when I might otherwise have merely condemned.</p> 
               <p>Ann hung upon her husband's arm the personification of sorrowful abandon.</p> 
               <p>The poor squire evidently strove to maintain his usual assumption of dignified importance; but it was vain; while Mrs. Norton bent over her boy, wailing in anguish.</p> 
               <p>As I was looking at my free, good-natured companion, I felt my sleeve pulled gently. Turning, I found that Jake had smuggled himself in with the family.</p> 
               <p>"Don't take on for this one," he whispered; "he's better off; he was a well-meaning chap, but he'd no head, Miss Jessie, no head; I doubt if it ever could have been seasoned."</p> 
               <p>Jake, with his inborn acuteness, had divined a great truth. God had been good to the pleasant, but unstable young man.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Prime and his wife were bending over their daughter; the intended bridegroom and Jonas stood beyond. The young physician was deadly pale, and Jonas wept like a child. Mr. and Mrs. Prime were in great distress. Pitiable, disconsolate pair, their lives had been devoted to gain; scarcely another thought had ever been indulged; to lay by money, and marry their children well, had been the height of their ambition; this accomplished, with "goods laid up for many years," they had reckoned upon taking their ease; now, how poor, weak, and miserable they must have felt.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Prime grasped my hand, crying, "Oh Jessie! is that my gal, my pooty little Debby? Oh; say tain't; say I'm dreaming! Her fixing out is all ready; her wedding gownd all finished. Oh, say tain't her boxed up in this coffin! Dear, dear, why couldn't the Lord have taken an old woman like me, and left a lightsome young creeter like my Debby?"</p> 
               <p>"Don't, Mann, don't!" ejaculated her husband, as he drew her away.</p> 
               <p>There was a slight disturbance at the door, then Mr. Turner rushed in; running up the aisle, he placed a bunch of white lilies upon Genevieve's bosom.</p> 
               <p>Prompt hands led the crazy man aside, and Aunt Nabby stooped to pick up the flowers, but James and I interposed. Though the tribute of insanity, they were very appropriate; they must remain. Aunt Nabby stared as though she thought us also demented. "Posies on a coffin! why, who ever heard of such a thing? People would take us for heathen!" was her amazed exclamation, as she moved aside.</p> 
               <p>The mourners now took their seats, and the house immediately filled.</p> 
               <p>Though Dr. Parkinson had not been on the best of terms with Parson Kirk-wood, every minor consideration was swallowed in this dire calamity, and the worthy doctor came kindly forward to assist his brother clergyman on this most trying occasion.</p> 
               <p>The services were impressive, and appropriate; but I was incapable of listening. Surely, those four coffins were more significant than any words; perfect silence would have been such a boon!</p> 
               <p>As both Debby and William were laid in the burial-ground upon the hill, the day was far on the wane when our dead were borne within the cemetery by the river side.</p> 
               <p>The hazy light of a warm August afternoon softened the landscape, which rested in a Sabbatical silence; not a leaf stirred, the river flowed peacefully on, breaking in low murmurs over the pebbly shore, reflecting in lengthening shadows the arched bridge, the quiet hamlet and green hills of the farther shore.</p> 
               <p>The two biers were set down beside the open graves, the mourners gathered around; beyond ranged a dense crowd. Preparations began for lowering the coffins.</p> 
               <p>At that instant, I recollected the horror Genevieve had expressed at our custom of committing dust to dust in silence. I looked up; Uncle Sam was at my side. "Cannot you say a few words, Genevieve so disliked our unceremonious mode of burial?" I whispered.</p> 
               <p>Uncle Sam gazed into my eyes with a look that brought the remembrance of that night so long ago, when I had asked him to sing and pray, then stepping to the head of the graves he reverently raised his hat, and drawing up his tall, erect figure, in solemn silence he glanced over the immense, throng. Instantly, every hat was doffed, every motion suppressed, while all eyes were fixed upon the commanding figure and sublime upturned face of the Methodist preacher.</p> 
               <p>There was a moment's silence, then the strong, clear, musical voice repeated: "Thus saith the Lord, the Lord of hosts: I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God." "Fear not; for I have redeemed thee; I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine. When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee.</p> 
               <p>"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone; but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit.</p> 
               <p>"I saw a new heaven and a new earth having the glory of God.</p> 
               <p>"And I heard a voice out of heaven, saying, there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things have passed away. And there shall be no night there, for the Lord God giveth them light, and they shall see His face; and His name shall be in their foreheads; and they shall reign forever and ever."</p> 
               <p>Clasping his hands above his head, with upraised look, and in still more impressive accents, he continued: "Absolve, we beseech thee, O Lord, the souls of thy servants, which thou hast thus suddenly taken out of this world, from all the bonds of sin, that being raised among thy saints, they may be refreshed in the glory of the resurrection, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p> 
               <p>"Come, to their assistance, all ye saints of God: meet them, all ye angels of the Lord; receive their souls, and present them in the sight of the most High.</p> 
               <p>"We humbly beseech Thee, most Holy Father, to look in thy divine compassion upon this bereaved group, upon these mourning relatives, and sympathizing friends; enable them to enter into that peace which, through Thy Son, Thou hast given to Thy disciples. Let the Comforter comfort them;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6399-00000095"/> give each the grace, from their inmost heart, to say, Thy will be done on earth as it is done in heaven, and Thine shall be the glory, the power, and the dominion, forever and ever. A-m e-n."</p> 
               <p>Solemnized and tranquillized, glad that what might have been Genevieve's last wish had thus been performed, gratified that the supplications she would have selected had thus been offered, satisfied that however men may differ in creed and ceremonial, that interiorly and spiritually there is but one church, that broad church, that church universal, whose builder and master is Christ, I turned to take the last look of those disensouled tabernacles.</p> 
               <p>That last look at what has been so cherished, so beloved! That last, last look! Well is it for us weak mortals, that at such seasons the world's eye is upon us, that the conventionalities of society restrain us, that home cares and family ties claim our immediate attention.</p> 
               <p>"Praise ye the Lord; he healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds."</p> 
               <p>Tea was over at the parsonage; Aunt Rutledge and other friends had departed. I was alone in my room, resting my aching head upon my hands, when Turk's cold nose, suddenly thrust between them, roused me from the half-stupor into which I had sunk; at the same moment, Dwight's voice called to me from the library: his voice, but in such a tone that I thrilled with dread Turk uttered a low whine, and preceded me down the stairs.</p> 
               <p>The young man was reclining in the large reading-chair. As I approached he raised his eyes, dilated and glittering, with the exclamation, "Take care of it, Jessie, take care of it!"</p> 
               <p>"What do you wish me to take care of?" I asked, soothingly.</p> 
               <p>"My brain; it is on the mantle Uncle Sprague took it out when he poured in the molten gold. All that gold of which I have been despoiled, seething hot, Jessie, fire for water, hate, hate, I never told of it, though I could then have sought your hand as an equal. I did not raise the river gods; I did not revenge; it was the Almighty, mind, Jessie, the Almighty; but it burns, it burns.' A deadly pallor passed over the wan face, and the sick man sank helplessly back.</p> 
               <p>For a moment, I was rooted to the floor. That which I had been dreading and expecting had come; I must be calm, act and endure. God would give me strength. Stepping softly into the hall, I summoned my aunt and James, despatched Peggy for Aunt Judy, and the master and Job for Dr. Evans.</p> 
               <p>The patient was taken up stairs, and after much trouble, placed in bed. Our good doctor shook his head with serious looks. The poor, delirious creature raved so incessantly about his uncle that a messenger was sent to fetch him, with the hope that his presence might bring calmness, but it merely added fuel to the flame; and the bewildered-stricken man was unceremoniously hustled from the room. There comes but a confused remembrance of the next few hours, but I recollect a wan, haggard face, with, eyes wild and glassy, that confronted me with silent, eager questioning as ever and anon I crossed the upper hall; and in the early dawn, a cold hand clutched mine, and with words of farewell, the parched, tremulous lips besought that I would not heed an insane man's words.</p> 
               <p>Eight long, weary days and nights ensued; tardy hours freighted with anxiety and agony; but on the ninth, the fever took a favorable turn, reason returned, and from that time, the patient continued to progress slowly but surety, towards recovery.</p> 
                
               <p>Incredible as it may seem, I scarcely ate or slept through those fearful days. Dwight would not permit any other to minister to his wants. Though our kind physician scarcely left us, and friends and relatives were solicitous in their attention, mine was the only hand that was permitted to perform the thousand attentions needed around the couch of pain.</p> 
               <p>Dr. Evans, with characteristic partiality, pronounced me the best of nurses, declaring that Dwight owed his life more to my care than to his skill; but I know that a Higher hand gave me the requisite strength for this new duty. Never falter, faint heart; lean upon the one strong arm, and "as thy day, so shall thy strength be." Terrible as this sickness was, I am not sure but what our family ought to have regarded it as one of the greatest blessings. For a time every thought and grief was swallowed in our care and anxiety for our precious Dwight; then came the calm, quiet hours of convalescence, peaceful autumn days, when everything grew subdued and mellowed, even to our grief.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Nugent had administered upon Mr. Raymond's estate. A will had been found in which the larger part of his fortune was donated to an orphan asylum. After Dwight was able to sit up, Mr. Nugent brought Mr. Raymond's private desk to me.</p> 
               <p>"The key is in the lock just as he left it an hour previous to his death," he said, with quivering lips; "you were his last most confidential friend; you alone ought to open it."</p> 
               <p>Could I? Dwight said Mr. Nugent was right, so I took the casket, murmuring, "Some time, some day when I could summon sufficient resolution."</p> 
               <p>In the silence of my darkened chamber on a sombre October day, the task was accomplished. With trembling touch, I turned the key, that key which those strong, warm fingers, now so cold and stiff, had last touched, and with blinding tears, raised the lid and glanced over the contents. Immediately beneath my eye lay a paper, evidently cast carelessly in as the desk was last shut, on which was written in our deceased friend's bold, clear hand:</p> 
               <p>"There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body; the first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven. And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.</p> 
               <p>"Former things are passed away; behold, I make all things new." "Alleluia, salvation and glory and honor and power unto the Lord our God."</p> 
               <p>With bowed head and a reverent heart, I accepted this last message, these last words, which my friend unwittingly, but surely providentially, had thus been directed to send to me. To come to me weeks after they were written, when I, short-sighted mortal, was pining for the presence of that earthy body, mourning that it had put on the spiritual, the heavenly.</p> 
               <p>With a better defined sense of the intimate connection of the spiritual and material worlds, I raised the closely-drawn curtains; as I did so, the dark, neutral gray clouds parted like a scroll, rolling back in pearly sheen, and the sun burst forth in a blaze of glory, enshrouding me in its warm rays. Cheered, gladdened, I sank upon the floor, in its genial beams. The half-benumbed flies came from their hiding places and hummed pleasantly in the light, the gorgeous maple leaves and golden elm sailed gently down through the soft ether, falling with a quiet rustle on the brown sward; a cricket chirped merrily on the hearth, and the steady creak of the cider-press, and the busy, joyous voices of the cider-makers, rose in muffled monotones upon the ear.<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6399-00000096"/> With hope, almost joy, I resumed my task. There were many parcels of business notes and papers; a journal which I felt that no, earthly eye save mine ought ever to see; and a package of letters that I did not read, but having obtained the address from Mr. Nugent, it was sent, with a note of explanation, to his early love.</p> 
               <p>An answer was immediately returned! Thus commenced an acquaintance which afterwards ripened into friendship.</p> 
               <p>On a mild, sweet, Indian summer morning, Dwight proposed riding to the riverside burying-ground. It was the first time we had been there since the funeral.</p> 
               <p>How vividly every minutia of that sorrowful time returned, as we alighted and made our way between the irregularly strown graves, gay with wild asters and golden rod. The river glided murmuringly by, fringed by its forest jewels. Amber, gold, ruby, garnet, and topaz, mingled with emeralds of every hue; the dark tints of the pointed pines sentinelled the distant headlands, while smoke-wreaths marked the homes of industry and contentment. A joyous shout rose from boatmen below, and busy teams clattered gaily over the picturesque bridge.</p> 
               <p>With brimming eyes, we paused before the newly-planted head-stones, conspicuous for their whiteness amidst the surrounding black ones.</p> 
               <p>"I go to prepare a place for you."</p> 
               <p>Yes, dear Genevieve, that is to be thy mission. James had made the right selection.</p> 
               <p>Though I had myself chosen the inscription for Mr. Raymond's, the words at that moment brought fresh power. Truly, "He was not here, <emph>but risen.</emph>"</p> 
               <p>Dwight leaned upon the monument and bowed his head in silence. I sank upon the mound that covered the body of her who had been so deservedly dear, and wept unrestrainedly. Thank God, Jesus wept!</p> 
               <p>In a moment, Dwight stole to my side. "Jessie,"-the voice was subdued and tender,-"can you listen to me? I have something to say to you; will you hear?"</p> 
               <p>Doubling my shawl into a cushion, that my patient should not receive ill effects from his ground seat, I replied in the affirmative.</p> 
               <p>"Ever thoughtful of my well-being, Jessie, I have made but a poor return for all your kindness; you have been hurt at my waywardness and lack of confidence, but I meant for the best. Do you recollect the visit I paid to Boston the December before James was married,-the time Ann Norton made that foolish fuss about my miniature?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, and that you most unaccountably fell to reading law in consequence."</p> 
               <p>"Which Miss Wisdom considered a most foolish waste of precious time! Now listen. That visit was caused by a letter from a friend of my father's, to a lawyer of eminence. He had something of importance to communicate to me under the strictest privacy. What was my surprise to learn that this important secret was no less a matter than the possession of a large fortune, which my Uncle Sprague was unjustly keeping from me during his lifetime. I do not say unlawfully, Jessie. Law and justice are sometimes unfortunately two very different things.</p> 
               <p>"My mother had never spoken to me of my pecuniary prospects, but at her death, from her last solemn injunctions, I gathered that money was to be one of the responsibilities of my situation in society; she certainly spoke of my being heir to a great inheritance. I was consequently somewhat surprised, when my uncle acquainted me with my limited means, but you know what a careless, thoughtless boy I then was. The first wish I ever seriously entertained, came with the information that you were an heiress. Then I desired money, became rapacious for wealth, moody and dispirited because I had it not. I must become your equal somehow; no one should ever have the chance to say, to dream, 'that I valued you for your possessions.' How was this to be achieved, had been the question for months. Here was the means: for an hour I was wild with joy as my legal Mend assured me that the property, owing to a flaw in some writing, could be immediately recovered.</p> 
               <p>"Did any one share our secret? No; his information had come through some papers of his father, who had been my grandfather's legal adviser. As I said, the thought that I should present myself before you, your equal in wealth, overcame for a time every other thought; but reflection brought doubts; I was about to demolish the honor of our house, bring shame upon its head, render our ancient name a by-word among honest and honorable men; I was to bring mortification into the home where I, an orphan boy, had been kindly received, I was to wring the heart of my weak but affectionate aunt, bring shame upon my innocent cousins, now just entering life. All this I should do to possess myself of a little yellow dross which, at some period, if I outlived my uncle, must become mine. Ought I to do this merely to gratify my pride? I could not decide; I returned, I studied the case; sometimes I resolved one way, then the other; I dared not confide in you. God knows what a turmoil my soul was in when we first met Raymond. Then I determined that your preference should decide. I saw at once that he was attracted, and I saw also that his strong, nature in a degree enveloped and bore on your own. How far would this go? I would wait and see! Oh, Jessie, I have had my forty days on the mount of temptation, and it has been hard to always say 'Get behind me, Satan.' Raymond helped me nobly that last morning; he was putting on his angelhood, and I, poor wretch, am still grovelling in this lower sphere, but I have had the grace to determine to leave my uncle to his conscience and his God. Am I not right, Jessie?"</p> 
               <p>I could not speak; could only Extend my hand which was eagerly pressed to heart and lips.</p> 
               <p>"You approve; thank you, Jessie. You cannot conceive what a load this disclosure has removed. Did I say anything of it in my delirium?"</p> 
               <p>"Something that I am now sure Mr. Sprague understood. I think that he believes that you possess a knowledge of his dishonesty, but I would still continue silent. I should not be surprised if he rendered you justice even during his lifetime."</p> 
               <p>"Perhaps so. I care little for the money, though that is not to be despised. I have learned the value of wealth; but if I can regain my health, I can win my bread. But I would like to feel differently towards my nearest relative; would like to be able to say to him frankly: 'I forgive you, but do not compel me to despise the son of my grandfather.'"</p> 
               <p>The hectic was rising; I turned the conversation, and led my charge away. With a mute farewell, we left the sacred spot till spring should invigorate the earth.</p> 
               <p>Thanksgiving passed, a sad, sad festival! Dwight's health had become nearly re-established, when one evening after a day spent in town, he commucated the astounding intelligence that the next week he should enter my Uncle Rutledge's store. As an offer of partnership from Mr. Sprague had been declined on the ground of a disinclination to mercantile life, I was<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6399-00000097"/> greatly astonished, and timidly ventured to remonstrate.</p> 
               <p>"Jessie, I could not act in concert with my uncle; his very presence suffocates me."</p> 
               <p>"Why enter into trade, it is your detestation?"</p> 
               <p>The pale, serious face lighted, as in a firm tone he replied: "At last I have gained sufficient knowledge to see that life was not given for enjoyment, but use. If we do the duty that is clearly pointed out, the patient performance of that duty will bring its reward; a higher, truer pleasure than selfish gratification can ever bring."</p> 
               <p>"But it is not your express duty to enter uncle's store."</p> 
               <p>"I beg leave to think otherwise, Miss Wisdom. You have not seen as I have. James has never been himself since Genevieve's death; your uncle has been chosen representative; most of his winter will be passed in Boston; the head-clerk is a wild, reckless fellow; the rest are young, idle lads. It is my duty to see to the management of affairs. Are you satisfied, lady-bird?"</p> 
               <p>I could urge no farther objection, though I dreaded the effect of care and confinement upon Dwight's weakened constitution; but as time wore on, these fears vanished. He grew stronger, and if he was graver, he was more evenly cheerful.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE GREAT FIRE.</head> 
               <p>THE infirmities consequent to her age had been heightened in my aunt by her recent grief, but she still maintained her position in the household and parish. To myself she had become much more familiar and confidential. Dwight had grown in her good graces to such a degree, that I laughingly averred that between Aunt Compton and Peggy, he would be completely spoiled.</p> 
               <p>The winter was fast passing, in a quiet, chastened sadness. Dwight spent the Sabbath with us, and the solitude was enlivened by the visits of sympathizing relatives and friends.</p> 
               <p>One bright February morning, I was surprised by my aunt's step on the stairs; she rarely came above in cold weather. Opening my door, I hurried her up to the fire. "Throw on this shawl. How came you to venture into the cold hall to-day?" I queried.</p> 
               <p>"I wished to look over one of my drawers; here is the key; it is the lower one in the case of drawers in the best bedroom; unlock it and bring it in here. I shall not catch cold by this great fire."</p> 
               <p>I took the key and crossed to the opposite front room. The spare chamber looked dusky and solemn, with its high-post tester bed and dark crimson hangings, stiff, high-backed chairs, and antique dressing-table. Crossing to the tall, carved case of drawers, I unlocked and drew forth the one directed. Carrying it to my room, I placed it on the table. Aunt Compton withdrew the linen covering, when glistening silk and rare lace were disclosed.</p> 
               <p>"These are old-fashioned affairs, Jessie, but perhaps you will find a use for them by-and-by; at any rate, your grandchildren will like to look at them."</p> 
               <p>"Old-fashioned affairs! why they are splendid! You must have been irresistible in this," I returned, lifting a dress, and shaking out the lustrous folds.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, that partly-gray lutestring was my favorite dress; it is a gown and skirt; here is an embroidered lawn apron to go with it when desired. This white damask was my wedding gown. I walked out bride in the blue paduasoy. This pink sarsenet was your uncle's favorite dress. I thought it too gay, but he said it matched my eyes and complexion. Here are a green damask and flowered brocade that were my mother's, but they have been cut over for me."</p> 
               <p>"How smart you were, aunt."</p> 
               <p>"Here are muslins. Here is an India muslin, and a light chintz. You will like this lawn, it is so fine, and this lace is superb."</p> 
               <p>"Here is a pea-green satin cardinal; but what is in that box?"</p> 
               <p>"Some jewelry. I have never worn it since my widowhood."</p> 
               <p>I opened the square, red casket; a set of brilliant knobs and drops, a brooch to match, and three or four rings were the contents. "What is this?" I asked, lifting a large, thick ring, of the old-fashioned yellow tint, engraved with a skull and cross bones.</p> 
               <p>"That is a mourning ring that was presented to your uncle at Madam Lowell's funeral; he was one of the bearers."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, yes, here is the inscription inside"; and I spelled out in the quaint marking:</p> 
               <p>"Sarah Lowell, ob. 28th of June, 1756, . 52."</p> 
               <p>The tears stood in my aunt's eyes, as she said, "Madam Lowell was the wife of the first minister settled over the congregation at the water side. She was a superior woman, and a second mother to me. After mother's death, I always went to Madam Lowell for advice; her death was a great blow at the time; I little thought what sore trials were in store-I will go down now, baby is waking. Peggy will bring her milk. Do what you please with these, my dear, they are yours now."</p> 
               <p>Thanking my aunt, I returned the articles to their place; but as I tended my sweet charge, my mind was full of the thoughts that they had suggested. Could the grave, silent woman I had always known have worn this rich, gay wardrobe? I strove to picture the young girl habited in these garments. It was impossible! If I had only a portrait! What a gift Dwight was burying. Surely he was not fulfilling his duty!</p> 
               <p>The afternoon and evening were enlivened by an unusual amount of company; and the mooted questions of the new meeting-house and a bass-viol in the choir, which were then agitating the parish, were duly discussed.</p> 
               <p>The master thought there was a greater need of new hearts than new churches. To which Polly Brown replied, "That he must not expect hearts to warm with such cold noses."</p> 
               <p>Aunt Judy opined, "That Parson Kirkwood had better git Irish Jim to play jigs on his fiddle, and a-done with it. What would her Sir have said to sich a Papistical desecration as that grunting viol. She shouldn't step foot in the meetin'us if it was kept in the singing pew."</p> 
               <p>Pretty Bethia Brown pertly told the old woman, "She could stay at home; for her part she wished it was an organ instead of a bass-viol."</p> 
               <p>Deacon Osborn said, "We ought to have a new meetin'us, but it must be set where the old one stood because it was the centre of the parish," while his son asserted, "That was folly. It ought to be at the foot of the hill. We should be dolts to climb that steep ascent longer."</p> 
               <p>The conversation next turned upon politics. Most of the party were Federalists, the master alone being a devout admirer of Jefferson; but as he delighted in a good-natured argument, the evening passed most amicably.</p> 
               <p>After our guests had left, I took the baby tip stairs, leaving Aunt Compton<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6399-00000098"/> sitting before the fire, her Bible in her lap, ready for the evening reading.</p> 
               <p>I had been above but a few moments when Peggy crossed from the kitchen to the sitting-room. I heard her lower the press-bed, then all was quiet, but in an instant the stillness was broken by a scream, while my name rang in frenzied accents from below.</p> 
               <p>Rushing over the stairs, I burst into the room, followed by Job.</p> 
               <p>Peggy was supporting Aunt Compton in her arms.</p> 
               <p>"What is it; is she faint?" I asked, running to the chair.</p> 
               <p>"I dunno! Bring the camphor; get some hot water, Job; oh, dear, dear, she's gone; her heart's still; her pulse don't throb; she's gone, Jessie! Give me the bottle, put her feet in the water; oh, dear, dear, it's no use! what shall we do? I turned, as I was putting on the blankets, and I seed something was the matter. I jest had time to catch her; she opened her eyes, then shut 'em; give one gasp, and it was over, It's no use, she's gone! oh, take her, Job; I can't stand; oh, me, oh, me, what shall I do?"</p> 
               <p>Stupefied, overwhelmed, I strove to recall life. Neighbors and relatives flocked in. Dr. Evans came; he but confirmed our fears. "Our dear Madam had thus quickly and easily entered her eternal rest; we ought rather to rejoice than to mourn." True, but nature rebelled. I fear that Peggy and I for a time were very sinful; we could not be reconciled to our loss. Dear Grandma'am at length tranquillized our grief, and Dwight's presence brought unspeakable comfort. It was deemed fitting that the dear remains should be laid away with every iota of old-fashioned ceremony. Professor Noles was summoned to preach a funeral sermon Dr. Parkinson, Parson Kirkwood and other neighboring clergymen, were invited to act as pall bearers. Mourning rings, gloves and scarfs were procured; all the insignia of outward respect and woe provided.</p> 
               <p>After three days of preparation, which seemed like a troubled dream, the obsequies were rendered in the old meeting-house, with due pomp and solemnity of ceremonial, and the aged form rested beside that of her husband upon the hillside.</p> 
               <p>The bustle ceased; loneliness settled over the parsonage. I was pleased to have it so: glad for free scope for my grief. Both James and Dwight were closely occupied by business cares. Polly, through Professor Noles' recommendation, had obtained the situation of an assistant in the Charlestown Female Seminary. Grandma'am remained with me a short time, but I saw that she pined for home; as Peggy and I were united in the desire to be alone, she was persuaded to return to South-end.</p> 
               <p>I had inherited the whole of my aunt's property, with the exception of legacies to Peggy and Job; there was no necessity for any alteration or innovation in our mode of life; so the clays stole on, still and protracted, unenlivened even by Peggy's scolding; her voice had grown strangely low and plaintive, and Job scarcely whistled, excepting at the barn. The baby caught the prevailing tone and crooned softly to herself, sitting quietly for hours, in the March sun as it fell in pale, cold beams upon the floor while I swayed listlessly to and fro in my low rocking-chair, holding the book or work unheeded in my lap.</p> 
               <p>Dwight broke this order of things. "I must take Addy and pay a visit to town. Peggy had a great deal of spring work coming on. Bethia Brown, bright, chatty Bethia, must come to help her. Job, must get another yoke of oxen, the long field must be broken up this season, the farm completely renovated."</p> 
                
               <p>Job scratched his head, looked dubious, pushed his hat still farther back, scratched harder, re-set his hat, said "Yes sir, yes sir, sartin, sartin," and went forth with a brightened look, and was soon whistling up and down, in and out, as usual, busy, devoted, hearty and happy. Peggy rebelled against Bethia, but at length declared "it no use, <emph>that boy</emph> always did get his own way." Soon the old huffs and sententiousness came back, as she and Bethia entered into the mysteries of soap and candle making, house cleaning, and spring bleaching.</p> 
               <p>Addy grew fat and joyous, and to Dwight's query of "How long I intended to nurse sinful repining, and keep doleful feelings warm?" I responded by acquiescing in his desire, coupled with that of my other relatives, that I should visit town.</p> 
               <p>It was the afternoon of the last day of May, when James drove to Uncle Rutledge's door, with the information that business called him to South-end. "Lieutenant Brown is at the store, and he tells me Polly is at home during her vacation; if you would like to ride, I can leave you till evening with your friend."</p> 
               <p>I was grateful for the opportunity. The day was unusually warm for the season; the Main road fresh in the beauty of spring garniture. Polly was quite taken by surprise; but though words seemed wanting, while the color went and came, I knew that I was weir come, of which I was fluently assured, after James's few words of salutation had been spoken, and he had driven on.</p> 
               <p>Polly had changed somewhat; place and position had given a composure and dignity to her manner and carriage which Accorded well with her stately figure and intellectual face.</p> 
               <p>My friend had much, to tell of Mr. and Mrs. Nugent; much I was sorry to hear. Ann's bereavement had not rendered her less frivolous, and Mr. Nugent was rapidly sinking in dissipation.</p> 
               <p>"Can he have forgotten Mr. Raymond!" was my involuntary exclamation.</p> 
               <p>"No; but with minds of a certain caliber, the only thought is to drown grief. This is wrong; sorrow is given for a purifier, a blessing, not a curse, if we would receive it aright."</p> 
               <p>"Few receive anything aright. But tell me of yourself, Polly; your school and your beaux."</p> 
               <p>What had I done, what had I said, to call up that pained look? It passed, and with a smile my friend replied: "I will describe my school, but you will be obliged to wait for the beaux, Jessie."</p> 
               <p>I laughingly rejoined all in good time, and tying on our bonnets, we sauntered over to the parsonage to call upon Peggy and Bethia.</p> 
               <p>The evening was advanced before James arrived, but he stepped in for a moment. Approaching Polly, he congratulated her upon the desirable situation she had secured.</p> 
               <p>Polly flushed crimson; suddenly raising her large eyes, to his, she replied, "I have sometimes thought that it would be as well if I was at home in the dairy."</p> 
               <p>For a second, my elegant, gallant guardian was taken aback. "Be lenient, Miss Polly," he stammered, "I know I entertained that opinion once, but I have learned to know you better; the china cup ought not to perform the office of the clay pipkin."</p> 
               <p>Polly blushed still deeper; James kindly took her hand, and with tears dimming his eyes, he gently, almost tenderly, whispered, "You are filling the right place, the place that Genevieve, our beloved Genevieve, would have desired you should occupy."</p> 
               <p>The young girl raised her eyes in mute reply. James pressed the now white and shapely hand in both of his,<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6399-00000099"/> and with a bow to the family, handed me to the chaise in silence.</p> 
               <p>Not a word had been interchanged; we had passed Donaldson Place, and were rapidly nearing home, when both were roused from the reverie into which each had fallen by a long, spiral flame, that shot suddenly into the sky from the very centre of the town; this was instantly followed by a sheet of fire that gleamed upon the spires and buildings, and in a few moments, illumined the whole eastern horizon.</p> 
               <p>At the first light, James had put Peacock to his swiftest trot; but as the flames spread, with a caution to me, this speed was increased to a run. I saw that the fire was in the centre of business, and was pretty sure it must be very near my uncle's store.</p> 
               <p>The flames spread inconceivably. As we flew down High street, everything was in a perfect glare. The alarm bells clanged, people shouted, and ran forward, bearing bags and buckets. As we neared home, the throng and din increased. The small, imperfect engines were at work; the fire companies were marshalled; the fire wardens directed the long lines of bucket-passers, while women and children were rushing hither and thither, and carts and drays loaded with goods rumbled past; men were shouting, women screaming, children crying; and above all this clamor, rose the rush, roar and crash of the mighty fire.</p> 
               <p>As we dashed to the door, Jake threw something from his arms and seized the bridle. "They have begun to clear the store, sir; it's the stable in Mechanics row," he gasped.</p> 
               <p>Mira at that instant ran up with her arms full, crying, "Our store must be cleared, James; I have the richest laces, and will get the embroideries."</p> 
               <p>"Don't go down the street again," he replied, as handing me his watch and pocket-book he ran to the scene of action.</p> 
               <p>Mira grasped my arm, "Come, we can save some of the light things." Stunned, bewildered, I followed my cousin's flying footsteps. Our progress was impeded; it was difficult to enter the store, but nothing at that moment could have stopped the dauntless girl.</p> 
               <p>The neighboring warehouses were being rapidly emptied; already the serpentine flames, coiled their fiery tongues above the solid, brick blocks, while a shower of fire was driven across the broad street, over the devoted southern part of the town.</p> 
               <p>Slowly pushing our way, Mira and I at length gained the door of the store. Two large carts stood before it, one loaded, the other nearly so. As the forward team started, I heard my uncle say, "Drive to the Baptist meeting-house." At that instant Dwight's head appeared at an upper window, and his clarion tones rang above the din: "To the North end, towards the Chain bridge!"</p> 
               <p>"Ay, ay, sir," shouted back the teamster. Glancing up, I saw who was respected as the commander; but who had ever gainsaid that voice when it chose to order?</p> 
               <p>Mira flew behind the counter, pulling down boxes and packages. Never shall I forget the scene as we came forth. It was with the greatest difficulty that we reached home, but we had saved more than a hundred dollars' worth of muslins and laces; surely, our efforts ought not to be counted.</p> 
               <p>A couple of bags of coffee had been sent to the house; our servant-maids were in the ranks passing water buckets, but with Jake's assistance the Rumford cookery was put in full operation, and pails of the refreshing beverage taken to those who were so eagerly, though vainly j battling the devouring element.</p> 
                
               <p>My uncle's store had long been down; from the housetop I had watched the conflagration of that long block of handsome and lofty buildings that, with no little pride, I had counted amongst my possessions. Other, less valuable tenements, but constituting no mean part of my property, were also doomed or already in flames.</p> 
               <p>The wind, at this moment, veered a point, and my uncle's splendid residence and the contiguous mansion became endangered. The gentlemen and maids came home; tubs of water, carpets and coverlets were taken to the roof, the silver and other Valuables, and clothing packed.</p> 
               <p>The older boys were serviceable; but as the billows of flame surged forward, it was decided to take the younger children and Addy to a friend's at the North-end. The portico, and every step and approach had, for hours, been crowded with the houseless throng; some only half dressed, others guarding some portion of clothing or household stuff snatched from the general wreck It was not easy to pass through this panic-stricken, despairing multitude, still harder to thread the streets blockaded with wares and furniture of every description.</p> 
               <p>Slowly marshalling my charge, and followed by my aunt's trusty nurse, bearing Addy in her strong arms, I gradually edged my way to the quieter thoroughfares It had been a cool, pleasant moonlight night, but the air had become murky, hot and stifling; a lurid glare cast a supernatural light over the scene, and clouds of smoke lowered overhead, their sable folds gathering density and breadth as the night wore on, while showers of fire poured over the devoted town.</p> 
               <p>The flames rolled wider and wider; the crowd and din increased. Vehicles, from a hand-barrow to a four-horse coach, conveyed goods to safer quarters; country teams, loaded with men and boys, rumbled past; women and children, weighed down with every species of property, rushed by; homeless creatures ran up and down, bemoaning their loss; divided families wandered hither and thither seeking each other; cries of every description rent the air. The wild screams of the feathered throng, fluttering up from their wonted retreats to drop into the flames, the wild neighing of horses, lowing of cows, the confused noise of exertion and distress, the murky, lurid atmosphere, the showers of sparks, the roar of the fire, and the crash of the falling timbers, combined a reality as awful as it was appalling, while above rolled the angry flames, curling, wreathing and hissing like the surging sea.</p> 
               <p>Again the wind changed. Uncle Rutledge's house was safe, but Miss Betty Bradshaw's had become endangered. At this juncture, Polly Brown's resolute face was a perfect Godsend. "I could not remain at home," was her response to our incoherent, tearful welcome. "Why, it is so light there that I could read fine print."</p> 
               <p>Aunt Rutledge, having become exceedingly anxious respecting Miss Betty, Polly, Mira and I determined upon striving to reach the house. This was effected by taking a circuitous route. There was no immediate danger; the sparks were carefully watched; but as the fire momently approached, it was deemed prudent to pack the most valuable articles.</p> 
               <p>The dawn's red light had begun to streak the seaward horizon, when the cry arose that the Baptist meeting-house had caught. At the commencement of the fire, this had been filled with merchandise and furniture, having been supposed too remote for danger.</p> 
               <p>Despair settled over the weary, frightened townsfolk; human effort<pb n="188" xml:id="VAC6399-00000100"/> seemed futile in this contest with the fiery element.</p> 
               <p>As the morning advanced, the crash of falling timbers arose above the general din. The authorities had decided upon demolishing everything in the range of the fire as the only hope that remained of staying its destruction.</p> 
               <p>A sublime but terrible spectacle was presented by the burning church, while right and left surged the flames, mingled with the sound of the falling edifices, and the shouts of those hurrying their prostration.</p> 
               <p>The last efforts, after a time, were successful. Not having fuel, the fire finally burnt itself out. But what a sight that morning's sun disclosed! More than seventeen acres, the best and most populous part of the goodly town lay in smouldering ruin; hundreds were houseless; many who the day previous had been in comfortable circumstances, were, in this short time, reduced to poverty; while others, who had been magnates in the land, in one night, had been despoiled of their strength.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXIII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">REVERSES.</head> 
               <p>TWO weeks dragged heavily forward; weeks of gloom and anxiety. Though most of the goods had been saved, the males of the family, even to the youngest clerk and Jake, seemed weighed down with care and despondency. Dwight, alone, made the least show of cheerfulness; and I saw too well that this was forced. Polly Brown remained with us as long as possible, and the gloom thickened after her departure.</p> 
               <p>The third week had commenced, when as I was sitting in Mira's room, dreamily gazing into the still, twilighted street, my cousin hastily entered. Closing the door with a jerk, she threw herself upon the bed, sobbing violently.</p> 
               <p>Astonished at this outburst from my usually self-possessed friend, I approached with the inquiry of what had happened.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Jessie, papa has broke!" was gasped, hysterically. A fear of this had been strangled in my breast since the fire; though it had been at the bottom of every thought, I would act permit it voice. Failures in those days were failure and disgrace,-a thing too horrible to contemplate! Now the reality was upon me, I sank beside my cousin and mingled my tears with hers.</p> 
               <p>Mira soon recovered from her first grief. Sitting up, she explained, that business had long been dull, many causes had combined to retard trade, and the fire had capped the climax; the firm had that evening suspended payment.</p> 
               <p>"Where are the gentlemen? How has your mother borne the news?" I anxiously queried.</p> 
               <p>"Papa is in bed with a headache; mamma has shut herself into the little back lumber room; James and Dwight, with Squire Montgomery, are talking over papers in the back drawing-room. Oh dear, dear! what shall we do?"</p> 
               <p>I had decided what I should do. Stealing down to the second landing, I seated myself at the top of the lower stairs awaiting Squire Montgomery's exit.</p> 
               <p>Curled up in the darkness, I was stumbled over by Judy Short, my aunt's trusty handmaiden. The poor creature had just come from my uncle's chamber, and was sobbing violently. "Oh, Miss Jessie," she exclaimed, "is this you? Dear, I forgot to light the entry lamp. The children, dear little souls, were so frighted at seeing their father and mother in sich a plight! Yer uncle is down sick, Miss Jessie; and yer aunt

                   says I must go, 'caus she can't pay my wages. Jest as if I'd leave her now, when she took me out of the 'sylum and did everything for me. No; you won't get me to budge. I shall stick to Miss Rutledge as close as Ruth did to her marm-in-law."</p> 
               <p>I told Judy she was right, and that I hoped some Boaz would be her reward.</p> 
               <p>"Drat the men; that ain't what I shall stay for," was the snappish reply, as her square figure disappeared down the stairs into the dim hall.</p> 
               <p>Dear, good soul! How her homely gratitude, and shrill, but cheery tones, had inspirited me. It was near eleven ere 'Squire Montgomery left. Dwight, having bade our friend good-night, passed to the sitting-room; James followed. I tiptoed down; two candles were burning upon the sideboard. James strode forward and seizing one of the decanters, poured out half a tumbler of brandy, which he drained at a draught. Turning to Dwight, he proffered him the liquor, saying: "We must put the spirits down to keep the spirits up, my lad."</p> 
               <p>Dwight gravely shook his head, and opening the cupboard below, quietly placed the half dozen decanters, which according to custom garnished the top of the sideboard, within it; having turned the key, he withdrew it from the lock and placed it in his pocket.</p> 
               <p>My guardian had sunk into a seat; his face hidden in his folded arms which rested upon the table before him. As he was unconscious of my presence, I ventured to speak.</p> 
               <p>"James," I started at my own voice, it was so hollow, so unnatural. My cousin also started and gazed up wildly. "James," my voice was steadier now, "Mira has told me of your misfortune. I suppose I too have suffered a heavy loss, but take the rest of the property, use the whole of the remainder,-it must be considerable,-use it as your own, to assist you in this emergency."</p> 
               <p>My guardian's face was ghastly when I commenced speaking, but it grew frightfully livid as I proceeded, and as I closed, he clenched his shut hands and ground his set teeth in anguish.</p> 
               <p>I was terribly startled.</p> 
               <p>"Tell her, tell her the truth at once," cried Dwight.</p> 
               <p>"I cannot, you must," James groaned.</p> 
               <p>"No"; though the tones were pitiful they were commanding. "It is your place, you <emph>must</emph> do it."</p> 
               <p>My cousin's face softened; he essayed utterance but in vain; the truth flashed upon me. I also was ruined.</p> 
               <p>"Dear James," I murmured, soothingly, as I passed my arms about his neck and sank upon his knee. He drew me to him and burst into such tears as man alone can shed in an hour of penitent agony.</p> 
               <p>"Jessie," he at last gasped, "God knows I never intended to wrong a living soul, above all, my Pet, my darling. But I was over self-confident, over self-assured. Pray not to be led into temptation, my precious! For over a year our firm has been like the drowning man catching at straws. I have obtained money every way possible, vainly hoping that, by some lucky turn, it might be again refunded. You had so much invested in real estate here, I scrupled less at taking up your stocks, but man proposes and God disposes; nothing of that is left excepting the land, and that at present is nearly valueless. You still own the parsonage, the wood-lot at South-end, and I suppose you will receive insurance from the Boston office,-ours can pay nothing."</p> 
               <p>I was still far from poverty. Another thought came. Both Job's and Peggy's little fortunes had been intrusted to Mr. Lee; "Were these also gone?"</p> 
               <p>My guardian shook his head, groaning forth: "Jessie, I am the veriest<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6399-00000102"/> wretch alive. I believe your uncle and I must both have been insane; Grandma'am, Miss Betty and Uncle John are also losers."</p> 
               <p>What ought I to do, what could I do? After a few moment's reflection, I asked if a mortgage on my remaining property would cover these debts; Job and Peggy ought not to suffer; grandma'am could ill afford a diminution of income. Uncle John and Miss Betty were of not so much account, but I wished to spare Aunt Nabby's animadversions. Could I lighten his load? With a still closer embrace I was assured that I could, that I did, "but darling, why should you despoil yourself? You will be penniless! What will you do? All your protectors are unfortunately in a like situation."</p> 
               <p>I was about to reply, that Peggy would give me food and shelter, when Dwight, who had drawn back during our conversation, suddenly came forward. I lifted my head from my cousin's shoulder and gazed inquiringly into his serious, tender eyes.</p> 
               <p>"Do you recollect the first time you took tea at Sprague Place, Jessie?" he asked in a low, appealing voice, "when the possibility of this misfortune was discussed?"</p> 
               <p>I had forgotten, but as Dwight spoke, it all rushed to mind. Again I saw that summer day, the room, the company, distinctly heard Dwight bidding me, "Wait till the time came." Yes, the time had come!</p> 
               <p>I rose and gazed earnestly into the thin, pale, but not hopeless nor despairing face. Dwight smiled, and opened his arms. "Will you come; Jessie?"</p> 
               <p>James murmured a blessing, as I was locked in that firm clasp, and passed out. "Have you a doubt, my darling, my own?" Dwight whispered, as he pressed his lips to mine.</p> 
               <p>"Not one."</p> 
               <p>"At last, at last!" he murmured, as he drew me closer, "but oh, Jessie, what would I not give to regain even a portion of that fortune which heretofore has proved such a bugbear to us both!"</p> 
               <p>My aunt's voice aroused us from personal thoughts. My uncle was very ill; would Dwight hasten for the physician?</p> 
               <p>The young man hurried forth, and I accompanied my aunt up stairs. Mira was bathing her father's forehead, while James also attended to the sick man. The physician shook his bewigged head, and looked grave. Before morning, my uncle was delirious; no one thought of rest that miserable night.</p> 
               <p>The morning carried the news, coupled with many false reports and rumors through the town, and at eight o'clock, one hard-hearted man, whose descendants we have since helped to daily bread, placed keepers in the house.</p> 
               <p>I thought that my usually calm, self-reliant aunt would become frantic. Friends were kindness embodied, and my uncle's fever abated, but it took a low nervous stamp, and it was weeks before he left his bed.</p> 
               <p>The various members of the family who had suffered by the failure were most generous and forbearing. Job and Peggy came immediately to our assistance. Peggy, in her happiest way, "bade me hold my tongue, not to let her hear any nonsense," every time I lisped a syllable about her loss, while Job nearly scratched the hair from his head, in his earnest, but clumsy declarations of attachment and fidelity.</p> 
               <p>"I musn't think of giving up the parsonage; he had ruther go with one meal a day than I should give up what I had allers had,-what I was born to. He had his two fists; could take care of hisself and Peggy, and me too, if I would demean myself so much as to accept his sarvice."</p> 
               <p>I quieted the good fellow with the intelligence that I would soon return to the parsonage, and he went home to work with renewed will.</p> 
               <p>Though there were many alleviating circumstances, the first weeks after the failure were anything but cheerful or satisfactory. For the first time in our lives, Mira and I realized what poverty really was. It had not looked fearful at a distance; I am not sure but what we had placed it in rather an alluring, picturesque light; but we found romance and reality two very different things. The first time that I went into the street, after our calamity had become public, I met an aged woman, that had been brought up in my Grandfather Bradshaw's family. She had recently resided with a daughter, who had been burnt out, and lost nearly everything at the great fire.</p> 
               <p>"I was coming to see if ye couldn't help me to a little money, Miss Jessie," said she. "I hear tell that the Gineral and Mr. Lee have run through. Well, it's no more than could be expected with sich extravagance! La, they doesn't know how to carry it out. They are ris out of nothing; but ye are a Bradshaw, Miss Jessie. Ye have the blood; anybody could see with one eye that ye was a born lady. I jest want a leetle change to get some cloth for the childern, and a leetle tea and snuff for myself. My time's short; 't'aint long I'll trouble anybody."</p> 
               <p>This was true, and though I was a little provoked at Aunt Dolly's non-appreciation of my mother's family, I felt that I ought to assist her to the utmost of my ability. My purse contained a few small coin, and one solitary five-dollar bank note. At first, I turned out the change; but as I glanced to the poor, tattered figure, and contrasted the good, honest, hard-working woman's garments with my rich mourning, that which had been procured for my Aunt Compton's sumptuous funeral, I felt ashamed or such a small offering, and presented the bill, which was received with many hearty expressions of gratitude. I had made the faithful retainer of my father's youthful home rich; but it was with rather a strange sensation that I proceeded on my way; for the first time in my life, I was not the possessor of a single dollar. What was I to do? I had no heart for the call I had intended. Turning towards home, I met Jake, who, with a most rueful visage, was leading Peacock by his halter.</p> 
               <p>Stopping, I inquired where he was going.</p> 
               <p>"To take this 'ere boss to 'Squire Montgomery; he's bought him. Oh, Miss Jessie, you could knock me down with a feather! I must get shet of this town. I'm gwine to sea right away, afore my heart's clean broke."</p> 
               <p>I was as much overcome as Jake. I had never thought of the possibility of parting with Peacock; should just as soon have thought of selling Turk. Silently patting the head the beautiful animal affectionately held down to me, I passed on, actually pulling down my veil to conceal my tears.</p> 
               <p>As I entered the house, I perceived one of the assignees, with two men, moving Mira's piano into the end-entry.</p> 
               <p>"What are you doing, Mira?" I tremulously inquired.</p> 
               <p>"I have sold my piano. Mr. Clark-son is taking it away."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Mira," I exclaimed, "You will want it, if you teach; you ought not to get out of practice."</p> 
               <p>"Won't you lend me yours?"</p> 
               <p>"Certainly; but is this necessary?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, Hannah is clamorous for her wages, and Jake has decided to go to sea; he must have an outfit. Ma has not money to procure the little luxuries<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6399-00000103"/> ries requisite for papa. I have got the original price,-a very good bargain. I have done right."</p> 
               <p>I could not gainsay my cousin, but quietly shifted the work-table and chairs to take off the bare look from the room till I could get my instrument from the parsonage. Though silent, thought was busy. My horse was still in the stable; she must go. Who would take her? I must drive a close bargain; get as much as possible.</p> 
               <p>My arrangements completed, I approached a window. Tom Games was coming up the street. He had gone from bad to worse till he had become expelled from reputable society; a besotted rou, he was shunned by the ladies, and avoided by his former male companions.</p> 
               <p>At a glance, I saw that, for a wonder, even at that early part of the day, he was sober. His look, as he approached, caused me to bow,-a thing J had not done for months. A gratified expression came into the bloated, brutalized face. An idea struck me; his late father had tied up the property in such a way that the dissipated son could only spend the income; he was rich, and kind to animals. Tom Carnes should buy my horse.</p> 
               <p>Opening the front door, I accosted the astonished castaway, and requested him to step in a moment upon a little business matter.</p> 
               <p>With a perplexed, almost bashful air, Mr. Carnes followed me to the drawing-room. Having begged him to be seated, in a hurried tone, I commenced: "I wish you to buy my Jenny, my mare; you are acquainted with her good points, give me what she is worth; what you can afford; and be kind to her, Mr. Carnes; perhaps I shall be able to redeem her by-and-by."</p> 
               <p>The poor fellow's face was actually radiant. "Thank you, a thousand thanks, Miss Bradshaw; wait here, I will be back directly." Tossing on his hat, he bounced out, slamming the door and ran down the street. In about fifteen minutes, he returned, warm and breathless, and tossed ten twenty dollar gold pieces into my lap.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Mr. Carnes, this is too much; the hearse is not worth this."</p> 
               <p>"You left the price to me; you told me to give what I could afford; do not pain me by demurring at my terms. If you knew how happy I am in doing this, how like a man, the man I once was, you have made me feel, Miss Jessie, you would see how infinitely I am your debtor."</p> 
               <p>I raised my head, and looked into the once fine, but now bleared and bloodshot eyes.</p> 
               <p>"Your life is not satisfactory then, Mr. Carnes?"</p> 
               <p>"Satisfactory! I am in hell before my time!"</p> 
               <p>I was touched by the tone of anguish in which this was uttered. "Break the bonds of sin, and fight your way to the other kingdom," I involuntarily exclaimed.</p> 
               <p>"The Great Commander would reject such a renegade. I have been a deserter from his ranks too long!"</p> 
               <p>"Say not so! You, though a debased, sinful mortal, have had all your inherent pity and goodness stirred by a slight, womanly appeal. Will you make the Deity less loving, less generous, than yourself?"</p> 
               <p>"God knows, Miss Bradshaw, that I am weary of my life, but how can I change it? Every one, save those like myself, turns from me; how can I expect compassion from above?"</p> 
               <p>"You cannot have forgotten that Christ said, 'there is joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth.' Take Jesus for your captain, arm yourself with a simple prayer, that long ago you lisped at your mother's knee, and you shall fight the good fight, receive the victor's crown, and hear the voice proclaim, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. Peace shall be yours here, and joy hereafter.'"</p> 
               <p>The heavy eyes lighted. "Miss Bradshaw your words are as those of an angel. Mortals cannot be stationary; I have sunk to the bottom; it is time to rise. Will you lend me that ring for a short time?"</p> 
               <p>I glanced at my finger; the plain gold circlet to which my companion pointed had been a Christmas gift from Dwight years before Seeing my hesitation, Mr. Carnes added, "I will be very careful of it; don't refuse me?"</p> 
               <p>How could I resist that earnest pleading tone? The ring was handed. Slipping it on the little finger of his right hand, he stretched it forth, exclaiming: "Now I have a talisman; surely, I cannot sully it! Miss Bradshaw, I will send for the horse directly; she will be kept at the stable near; be so kind as to do me the favor to use her the same as ever." A bow ended the sentence; ere I had time to reply, I was alone.</p> 
               <p>"Jessie, who was that went out the front door?" inquired my Aunt Rutledge, entering the parlor.</p> 
               <p>"Tom Carnes."</p> 
               <p>"How came he in the house?"</p> 
               <p>"I asked him in. He has bought Jenny."</p> 
               <p>"Jessie, you have hitherto been somewhat privileged, but I warn you to circumspection; the great heiress was a different person from poor Jessie Bradshaw. I fear you have not acted with your usual prudence. I hope Tom will not presume upon it, and call again."</p> 
               <p>I made no reply. How I longed for Dwight's return. Would he scold me? The first glimpse at his face quieted every fear. I had not seen so much cheerfulness there for a long time.</p> 
               <p>"Well, Miss Wisdom; you have driven a brisk business this morning. What upon earth put it in your head to offer Jenny to Tom Carnes?"</p> 
               <p>"Have you seen him? has he told you?" I eagerly asked.</p> 
               <p>"Yes; all, Jessie, every word; but how came it about?"</p> 
               <p>"I do not know; it was one of my impulses."</p> 
               <p>"Jessie, do not you think such things sometimes come from a direction that we do not recognize?"</p> 
               <p>"I should like to believe so; indeed, I think I do. I am sure I cannot account for much that I say and do; it seems as though I was merely the agent of some unexplained force that impels me onward. Did I do right this morning, Dwight? I could not fail to pity and hope for this man, fallen as he is."</p> 
               <p>"You did, as you generally do, perfectly right. It would be well for us if we more frequently remembered that our Lord sat down with publicans and sinners. Tom Carnes shall never again say that there is not a person in the Wide world to take his hand and call him friend."</p> 
               <p>Uncle Rutledge had a nephew established at the South. After much consideration, he decided to join him as soon as his health would permit. James and Dwight remained undetermined as to their course. Dwight said he should not leave James; they must sink or swim together. I saw all the generosity of this determination. My high-spirited cousin had been nearly prostrated by his misfortunes. One would scarcely have recognized the handsome, energetic man in the wan, listless being, apparently without hope or aim. Judy Short declared, "He'd never be fit for nothing without a hoss and business; jest set him going again, and git Peacock back, and we should see Major Lee once more." We felt that Judy was right; but how to set him<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6399-00000104"/> going again, was the question. Dwight and I held many an anxious conversation respecting ways and means.</p> 
               <p>"What if you were to go to your Uncle Sprague, and, in a friendly way, claim your own?" I said to him, one day.</p> 
               <p>"Never! He knows the circumstances; if he is not disposed to be either just or generous, I will not trouble him."</p> 
               <p>That evening, the six o'clock stage stopped before the house. I answered the knock. "Will you ask Mr. Sprague to step here?" said the driver, "I have a letter for him."</p> 
               <p>Dwight was at tea; I signified that I would take him the missive.</p> 
               <p>"Pardon, Miss; I was directed to place it in Mr. Dwight's own hand."</p> 
               <p>I earned the message</p> 
               <p>"My Uncle Sprague's writing," said Dwight, as he returned to the table. "What has caused him to write?" Breaking the seal, a shower of bank notes fell from a blank envelope.</p> 
               <p>A cry of surprise arose from the circle around the table. With flushed cheeks, Dwight gathered the money. "Five thousand dollars! that was a pretty tall sum to trust to one man, wasn't it?" he said, turning over the notes in his hand. "The Jehus on our Eastern line are trumps! Well, James, what do you say to this luck? This money is my own; I ought to have six times the amount, but perhaps it was not convenient for my uncle to advance a larger sum at present. Now I think we may venture to rebuild the store, and commence business in a quiet way."</p> 
               <p>The light had come to my guardian's eyes. "How is this? I thought you had received your whole inheritance." A look from me interrupted the sentence. James had been watcher that terrible night of Dwight's delirium,-a suspicion of the truth dawned upon him. After a moment's hesitancy, he added, "I congratulate you, my dear friend. It has come in the right time. Yes, it will put us on our feet again; with God's help, these losses shall be retrieved."</p> 
               <p>"That is right; put a brave heart to the work. 'Remember Lot's wife,' and go ahead, is my motto," and with something of their old light-hearted activity, the two gentlemen drew aside to discuss business plans.</p> 
               <p>I was making arrangements to return to the parsonage. As I was retiring to my chamber, Dwight followed into the hall, and handed me a bank note. "I wish I could treble it, Jessie, but Mrs. Sprague will have her 'thirds' out of that big fortune that is coming."</p> 
               <p>I made one of Peggy's faces, and told him to keep his money, I did not need it.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, you do; you need new toggery, so does Addy; you <emph>shall</emph> take it."</p> 
               <p>"Hoity, toity, that is pretty good! Luckily you haven't yet the legal power to enforce your <emph>shalls.</emph> I am my own mistress yet, and I tell you flatly I will not touch one cent. Why, I am rich! You needn't crow over me with your big fortune! I can drive as good a bargain as some other folks, and I 've lots of stock on hand."</p> 
               <p>"Part with another thing at your peril, and if you do not apply for money if it is needed, I will jilt you, certain sure, and marry Miss Kate Donaldson."</p> 
               <p>"She wouldn't take you, Mr. Assurance! Oh, Dwight, that reminds me that I wished to ask if Mr. Donaldson had become seriously impoverished by the fire."</p> 
               <p>"I fear that he has; he has lost much in the shipping line, and the fire has about done him up, but the old gentleman stems the tide bravely; his credit is still good. So you do not fear Miss Kate as a rival?"</p> 
                
               <p>"Not one bit, and I forewarn you that I shall buy and sell just as I please. What do you say to that, mon garon?"</p> 
               <p>"That I am thankful to see these dimples again! Seriously though, isn't this funny? I have sought my vocation so long, and now it has come in a second-class store, with a dispirited, broken-down partner, a score of debts to be cleared off, and only sufficient cash for a commencement. Still, this has been the happiest day of my life. I never was half as happy as I am at this moment, my Jessie," he added, with a good-night kiss. It was certainly right to rejoice, still my heart was heavy as I mounted the stairs. Dwight had not found his vocation!</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXIII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE TORNADO.</head> 
               <p>THE summer had been a busy one both in town and country. A new store was rapidly rising upon the site of the former one, and thriving crops bade fair to repay Job's improvements at the parsonage. My uncle had decided to establish himself at the South, but the family were not to move thither till the following spring.</p> 
               <p>The anniversary of our great sorrow had past. Hours that teemed with ever-to-be-remembered memories. Green turf and bright flowers covered the graves of our beloved,-fit emblems of the life their spirits had entered.</p> 
               <p>It was a soft, hazy September evening, as Goody Sloper-who since the accident had become Peggy's right-hand woman-was leaving, after a day's work at the parsonage, she was directed to pick up an apron-ful of "pumpkin sweetin's" to bake for her old man, who was always "poorly."</p> 
               <p>I accompanied the Goody to the orchard to look after a piece of linen which I had there to bleach. As the ingathering clouds betokened rain it was decided to take in the cloth.</p> 
               <p>At that moment, Uncle Jerry Finn, who had been employed upon the farm during the summer, approached, bearing a letter.</p> 
               <p>"The Lieutenant gave it to me, Miss Jessie, he just got it at Port." said the man, as he gallantly assisted Mrs. Sloper in drawing up the pins and rolling the cloth.</p> 
               <p>Glancing at the superscription, I saw that the missive was from Polly. I had not heard from her recently, and with great satisfaction, I slipped the letter in my pocket.</p> 
               <p>"It will be a dark night," said Uncle Jerry, glancing round as he took up the linen, "I shall have to hurry, or I shall see the wolverine to-night."</p> 
               <p>"The wolverine! what is that, Uncle Jerry?" I asked in much surprise, as I followed my humble retainer through the grassy path.</p> 
               <p>"Well, I can't jest tell ye, Miss, 'cause I never seed him, but he's a terrible critter that ranges round in the woods beyond the pond. He went past me tother night like lightning, with every hair on him whistling like a bell, screaming whicker-whack, whicker-whack! I run I tell ye, but the faster I run the louder he screamed, whicker-whack!"</p> 
               <p>"Pho, nonsense, Uncle Jerry, twan't nothing but the rattle of ye'r leather breeches," said the Goody, derisively. Uncle Jerry hung his head ruefully, whimpering, "So Molly Pinn says, but I know better."</p> 
               <p>Having reached the house, I bade my companions good-night. After a lingering look at the fair prospects, the ripening fruit and golden corn, I entered to read Polly's letter.</p> 
               <p>As I broke the seal, a bank bill fell from the folds. What did that mean?</p> 
               <pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6399-00000105"/> 
               <p>"Do not think I forget you," Polly wrote. "Some feelings are too deep for words, though I have said so little; I can never forget that Dwight saved my life, that the Goody then saved us both, that I was left while Genevieve was taken.</p> 
               <p>"I cannot speak or write of that awful moment which must henceforth overshadow our lives; I know the cloud has a silver lining,-still it is a cloud.</p> 
               <p>"Better that it should be so; the clear sky has its charms, but the changing cloudlets add beauty to the heavens. Jessie, I willingly accepted your assistance when it was needed, please to reciprocate the favor. I have no use for the inclosed; I would I could increase it tenfold. Please to buy the Goody a nice, warm winter gown, and use the rest for Addy and yourself."</p> 
               <p>With a strange mixture of emotions, I turned the fifty dollar note in my hand. I sat till a late hour ruminating upon the changes of my recent life; the rain was falling steadily when I sought my pillow.</p> 
               <p>I was awakened by a noise below, and Job's voice calling from his room, asking what was the matter.</p> 
               <p>"We are to have something awful," Peggy returned, "I am barring the fore-door."</p> 
               <p>As she spoke, I detected a strange, rushing, roaring sound, which then I could not liken to anything I had ever heard; now I know that it nearly resembled the noise of a railway express train.</p> 
               <p>Springing from bed, I slipped my feet in my slippers; throwing on a wrapper, I caught up Addy and ran below. As I reached the hall, the fury of the tempest burst over us,-a moment as fearful as indescribable I Groping my way in the impenetrable darkness, I reached the kitchen. Peggy was striving to light a candle; by the time this was accomplished, the storm had passed, the rain ceased; and as we threw open the door, the moon burst from the parting clouds; but the roar of the hurricane could be distinctly heard, as it hastened on its path of destruction.</p> 
               <p>One glance without, showed terrible devastation. With the exclamation, "We are ruined!" Job stepped forward, followed by Peggy and myself.</p> 
               <p>Both house and barn were partially unroofed; the cider-house was demolished; the corn-barn upset, every door and gate unhinged; sheds, fences, and trees prostrated; farming tools in every direction; the whole surface, wherever the eye rested, presented a confused debris of ruined buildings and crops. Feathers, baskets and barrels, had been lifted from the garret, through the opening in the roof, and lodged in the yard beneath. A brass kettle that had been turned down by the back door, was found some time after in a swamp half a mile distant; the milk pails were hither and thither, heavy carts and sleds had been blown about like down; everything was in the greatest confusion that imagination could depict.</p> 
               <p>Looking towards the master's, we saw that they too had suffered in their out-buildings. A light was burning, and the two families soon assembled, aghast and overwhelmed.</p> 
               <p>While we gazed at our household wreck, the lights gleamed brightly in a dwelling at no great distance, where a party of young people were enjoying themselves, wholly unconscious of their proximity to danger; but before morning, we learned that a small house above us had been demolished, and a child killed. Fragments of this building were afterwards discovered, with a bonnet and some utensils, eight miles distant from the spot from which they were lifted.</p> 
               <p>Light disclosed a straight path through the woods where the wind had swept everything before it; this gradually narrowed, till the last traces of the cloud demon were detected upon a wharf in town, where it overturned a small building.</p> 
               <p>A circle of sad, anxious faces clustered about the breakfast-table in the early morning. Great dependence, had been placed upon the year's harvest; especially to the fruit crop had the hopeful eye been turned. Now, over sixty trees lay uprooted above their crushed and bruised burden, which, but yesterday, had with such promise mellowed in sunlight. Corn was prostrated, vines tangled and torn, good buildings were wrenched and shattered, fences and walls were flat. With no funds ready for repairs, surely there was cause for dismay; enough to discourage the <emph>bravest heart,</emph> enough to tax one's endurance, and to try one's faith.</p> 
               <p>Goody Sloper, Uncle Jerry, and crazy Turner interrupted our melancholy meal. The Goody, in her comical way, assuring us, "That she would be answerable for the witches; we were too much in their favor for them to have effected this mischief," while poor, bewildered Uncle Jerry "Was sartin the wolverine wa'n't round for nothing. He'd run past him the night before, crying, whicker-whack, louder than ever." The crazy man, sober and earnest in our extremity, stood with his tools in hand, then bade the nonsense hush! "Miss Jessie, I can work as well as ever. Please to show me above; your roof must be mended immediately."</p> 
               <p>Surprised and pleased, I escorted the joiner up-stairs, when he commenced a work which continued till everything was again complete.</p> 
               <p>Other help immediately arrived, and in a short time, James and Dwight appeared. The whole parish rallied to our aid, and in a, few weeks the old homestead had regained somewhat of its usual appearance.</p> 
               <p>To defray this extra expense, James parted with several costly articles of jewelry that had been reserved for Addy. Though they were mementos of, the mother she could here never know, I felt that they were worthily bestowed. That her father's probity and self-denial was a far more precious legacy to his daughter than the most priceless jewels.</p> 
               <p>I had been passing the day at South-end, when towards evening we were startled by Dwight's approach. As I had supposed him in Boston, I was greatly surprised.</p> 
               <p>"He has a lady and two children in the chaise. Who can they be?" said Aunt Nabby.</p> 
               <p>The door opened: "Aunt Sukey, dear Aunt Sukey!" was the amazed cry.</p> 
               <p>Yes, it was Aunt Sukey and her two children.</p> 
               <p>"Did you suppose I could stay from you through all this affliction?" she exclaimed, as we removed shawl and bonnet. "I tried to come last summer; but now I <emph>must</emph> come. Don't cry so, Jessie; the sun shines after the shower. I shall be just in time for your wedding."</p> 
               <p>"Then we are to have a long visit?"</p> 
               <p>"No; Mr. Selwin will come for me in a few weeks."</p> 
               <p>I looked as I felt, mystified. I expected to be married some day, but not this season certainly.</p> 
               <p>Dwight smiled: "It is cruel to take you away to-night, Jessie; but I must beg you to ride with me to town after tea. Aunt Sukey will take care of Addy."</p> 
               <p>Certainly; Aunt Nabby would do that: but what was in contemplation?</p> 
               <p>Glad as I was to again meet my aunt, my curiosity was aroused to such a pitch, that I gladly found myself alone with Dwight on the road to town.</p> 
               <pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6399-00000106"/> 
               <p>"What is it, Dwight?" I impatiently queried, as we descended the steep avenue.</p> 
               <p>"I scarcely dare say. The peerless Miss Bradshaw will, I trust, forget her pre-eminence; will condescend to merge herself among the common mass of the common sisterhood."</p> 
               <p>Of course I should do nothing of the kind. Exalted myself, I should exalt my sphere, bring it, however humble, to my own level.</p> 
               <p>"Jessie, does this come from the heart; is it a soul sentiment? Speak truly; I am far from jesting!"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, it is a truly soul sentiment from the inmost heart's recess."</p> 
               <p>"Then listen. Do you recollect the tavern in Belleville?"</p> 
               <p>Wonderingly, I answered in the affirmative.</p> 
               <p>"That is to be rented; with your concurrence, I shall hire it. There is a good farm attached, and though the company consists principally of country traders and drovers, money can be made at the stand."</p> 
               <p>Dwight turn tavern-keeper! I become the landlady of a bustling public house! My first amazement subsided into a feeling of merriment; considering our education, position and antecedents, it was too ludicrous.</p> 
               <p>Dwight was a little nettled. For once, he was too seriously in earnest for mirth.</p> 
               <p>"But how had he come to think of this scheme?"</p> 
               <p>"Tom Carnes had suggested it, but he had the delicacy to see that the place was unfit for you, as I know it is, but what can we do? The times are bad, and are not going to mend. England will never be satisfied until she gets a second drubbing. A war will be hard upon New England, but the sooner it is over the better. I wish our people could see this, put their shoulders to the wheel and drive it through; it would spare both life and treasure."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Dwight, how can you talk thus lightly of war?" I cried.</p> 
               <p>"War is a necessary evil sometimes. We must endure it as the sick man does his medicine, for the cure of worse evils."</p> 
               <p>"That is anything but Federal logic; but about this tavern scheme. Did Tom, does James recommend it?"</p> 
               <p>"They think money can be made of it, but they unite in thinking the position an unfit one for you."</p> 
               <p>"Why unfit? Is it too ungenteel, too low, only suited to people whom I have been accustomed to call below me in the social grade?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, you comprehend exactly."</p> 
               <p>"Then, Dwight, I am ready to take up my burden beside you; what is fitting for you is fitting for me. If you think this place desirable, in our present circumstances, if you wish to enter the business, I am ready to help you to the utmost of my ability."</p> 
               <p>There was a deep tremor in my lover's voice, as pressing his lips to mine, he murmured, "God bless you, Jessie! He will bless you; he will give me grace to make your life what your husband ought to make it."</p> 
               <p>There was a pause, during which each heart communed with itself and all was still. That sweet, silent communion, when we know our thoughts are fully shared by another; that communion, when mere words are such a sacrilege!</p> 
               <p>As we neared town, Dwight proposed, as we were to pass the inn, that we should stop and examine the premises.</p> 
               <p>As I was now acquiescent to any and every wish, we drove to the door, but my heart sank as we descended from the chaise and knocked at a large old-fashioned dwelling, surrounded by a cluster of barns and out-buildings.</p> 
               <p>A man, bearing a tin lantern, came to the door, and upon learning our errand, in a sulky tone bade us enter.</p> 
               <p>We found ourselves in a large, untidy kitchen; a woman with unkempt locks, and a slatternly dress, dusted out two chairs with her apron, and asked us to be seated. Dwight signified his wish to examine the premises. Snuffing the candle, she preceded us over the low, smoke-stained, dirty rooms. My heart sank lower, as we went from one to another. The small tallow candle flickered in spectral lights and shades around the bare, cheerless apartments, giving a weird air to the substantial homestead, while the chill, autumn wind sighed mournfully through the narrow passages.</p> 
               <p>"Did not this house once have the reputation of being haunted?" I whispered Dwight.</p> 
               <p>The woman caught the question. "Yes, they said Liddy used to set at that winder; Liddy was the sister they cheated. Everybody went to look at her, and everybody come away scart e'en-jest to death. They all declared there she was, with her white face, jest as she used to set alive. I come to see her, and was jest as sure 'twas Liddy's speeret as that I'm here. At last, Parson Morton come to examine the matter, and he found 'twant nothing but this ere paper pasted over this winder-pane. See, it's a piece of a copy-book, but in the road it looks jest like Liddy now."</p> 
               <p>With a shiver, I drew Dwight away. As we drove forward, he commenced a recital of the plans he had formed, the alterations and repairs that would be needed. "Carnes says I shall have possession immediately. It will be best to rent the parsonage, as Peggy must come with you, and I shall need Job; the good fellow will follow you to the land's-end, I am certain. You will explain our designs to them. Jessie, I think I can get the house ready in a month; please to set our wedding-day early in November."</p> 
               <p>The tornado had given my nerves a severe shock, the evening's occurrences had further unstrung them; I essayed to speak, but the effort ended in an hysteric sob.</p> 
               <p>"What am I doing, my darling love?" Dwight hurriedly exclaimed. "Do forgive me! Act your own pleasure; arrange everything when and how you wish. Don't sob so! I am growing a regular brute."</p> 
               <p>"No, only getting as like James as two peas! Who would have ever dreamed of Dwight Sprague's talking in this unsentimental style of his nuptials with the distinguished Miss Bradshaw," I laughingly returned. Swallowing my emotion, in a playful tone, I bade him "Get his house fixed; I would engage to be ready to occupy it."</p> 
               <p>"And Job and Peggy?"</p> 
               <p>"They will be willing to share our new home. You can rent the parsonage if you find a tenant."</p> 
               <p>"Joseph Osborn's youngest brother would like it; so everything is now in train for our new home. <emph>Our home</emph> Jessie. The words sound very sweet. Pray that God's blessing may rest upon it."</p> 
               <p>I could not forbear disclosing my new plans to Mira as we retired for the night. My cousin's face was a study, as I proceeded. Bewildered astonishment at length settled into indignant disapproval. "Dwight and you turn tavern-keepers! I should think you'd better I Why, are you both demented? Who suggested this ridiculous scheme?"</p> 
               <p>"Tom Carnes. Now don't get furious, Mira. Look at the matter! James must repay his debts if possible; the store will not be very profitable these dull times. The prospect for commercial men is dark, this stand pays well now; in Dwight's hands, it will do<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6399-00000107"/> more. Job will do well with the farm, the parsonage will also bring an income; it certainly looks a promising plan. We must earn our bread; if it is procured honestly, I care not if the world consider the means not sufficiently distinguished. Our life must ennoble our work."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I suppose I must acknowledge the justice of your reasoning, and yield my scruples to your superior sense; join Mr. Games in pronouncing Miss Bradshaw as eminent for intellectual as she is for personal endowments."</p> 
               <p>"Did Tom make the whole of that big speech? he must have meant Miss Rutledge. But how came you to talk with him?"</p> 
               <p>"He called to see Dwight; as he had stepped out, I was obliged to entertain him. He asked for a song, but tears filled his eyes as he turned over my music, saying, 'how this brings back the past! I last heard these airs at Mr. Lee's.' Then he spoke of Genevieve and you. 'They have been my saviors,' he added, 'kept me from perdition.' I felt conscience stricken, Jessie. I had done nothing! Like the Levite, in my superior purity, I had turned aside, to leave him to die in sin and despair."</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Games would tell you that future favor would make ample amends, but we must prove him, Mira."</p> 
               <p>"Why, you are as bad as mother! I never should marry Tom Garnes; I always disliked him, and have no faith in reformed rous."</p> 
               <p>"Squire Montgomery is a much steadier young man, and John Knight is handsomer!"</p> 
               <p>"Now, Jessie, if you don't hush I certainly will disown you! Now, when your aristocratic friends will all turn a cold shoulder, it will be an easy matter."</p> 
               <p>"I suppose the tavern will sink some frivolous, worthless acquaintances."</p> 
               <p>"Probably, ma chere. The cream of upper-tendom will ignore Mrs. Sprague, the innkeeper's wife. You will be obliged to put up with the skimmed milk, Jessie. But what matters it! We will turn philosophers and laugh at the world, with its follies and vanities."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXIV.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE TWAIN SHALL BE ONE.</head> 
               <p>AS was natural, our project caused quite a sensation throughout our extensive circle of relatives and friends. Though a diversity of opinion was held respecting its desirability, none, whose judgment we respected, strictly condemned the experiment.</p> 
               <p>The inn was quickly cleared and put under repair, while preparations for removal were commenced at the parsonage. As had been anticipated, Job was ready to do what Mr. Dwight thought best, and Peggy, after a violent declamation about "that boy's nonsense and my silliness," settled into a quiet huffiness, which I well knew denoted considerable internal satisfaction.</p> 
               <p>Though the parsonage had been well furnished, several new articles were needed, for the public house. Owing to the restrictions of trade, every species of goods was exorbitantly high.</p> 
               <p>As Aunt Sukey was about to pay a visit to her husband's relatives in Boston, it was decided that I should accompany her in order to make my purchases.</p> 
               <p>It was nearly dusk when the stage set me down at Mrs. Nugent's, where I had decided to pass the night. I had expected to surprise Ann, but her evident embarrassment, almost chagrin, disconcerted and distressed me. Though her first hesitancy quickly passed into a show of cordiality, I felt that I was not welcome, and there was an intangible something, so unusual in her manner, that first, curiosity, next suspicion, was aroused.</p> 
               <p>Sufficiently uncomfortable, after tea, I seated myself in the drawing-room with a vague sense of uncertain dread. Ann also seemed possessed by the spirit of unrest; a habit so opposite to her natural passivity that my wonder momently increased.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Nugent, his wife informed me, was absent on a hunting excursion.</p> 
               <p>Between eight and nine our tete-a-tete was broken by a loud double knock at the main entrance. Ann started from her chair with flushed cheeks, but sank back again with an evident effort for self-control.</p> 
               <p>What did such emotion portend? A quick, manly step passed up the stairs, and John Knight entered, with an easy familiarity that showed him to be no stranger in the precincts. Slightly nodding a good evening to our hostess, he advanced with much empressment to greet me. "It was such a pleasure to see me previous to his departure on the morrow for a long sojourn at the South."</p> 
               <p>The gentleman, as usual, was highly agreeable during the hour's chat. Ann continued silent and nervous. Had I obtained a key to a mystery? Could my suspicions really have a foundation? I dared not answer my own questionings.</p> 
               <p>A lingering adieu of myself was taken, with messages to Dwight and others; a quick glance, with a slight bow to Ann, and the visitor passed into the hall. Mrs. Nugent rose, hesitated, then hurried forward; there were a few low words, then in a louder tone, which I could not but suspect was intended for my ear, he bade the lady good-by. "Remember me to Nugent, and take care of these lilies and roses till I return," he cried, as he descended the stairs. The door clanged behind him, and Ann came back to the parlor.</p> 
               <p>Lighting a taper, she said, "You must be tired, Jessie; though I have much to ask respecting my country friends, I will not keep you from repose."</p> 
               <p>I assured her I was not at all fatigued, had no inclination for sleep; but with a few disjointed compliments, she preceded me to my room, where I was immediately left with a hope that I might rest well.</p> 
               <p>This was so contrary to her usual mode,-for no one ever enjoyed a gossiping chat more than Ann,-that my suspicions were necessarily strengthened. After thinking over matters awhile, I slipped on a dressing-gown, and having hidden my light in a closet, I sat down to await the night's issue. From the muffled sound from Ann's room, I knew that she was still up. There was the suppressed noise of opening and closing of drawers, and soft steps to and fro; at last, these ceased-all was quiet. I was beginning to think of bed, when a low whistle sounded from the court. I started to my feet, and peeped from my unlatched door. Ann came forth, and crept stealthily down the stairs, bearing a good-sized trunk.</p> 
               <p>The side entrance was softly opened, there was a pause-next I heard a man's step. The moon made everything visible. John Knight came into the main hall. Ann followed, with a whisper that reached me as I leaned over the balusters.</p> 
               <p>"You must carry the trunk out," she said, "I can't hold it another instant; it is at the foot of the stairs."</p> 
               <p>My worst suspicion was verified. What must I do: alarm the house? I would screen Ann if possible. Stepping back, I seized the candle, and ran<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6399-00000108"/> down stairs, screaming, "What is it? what is the matter, Ann?"</p> 
               <p>The guilty pair turned with a start. For an instant, we confronted each other; then, with an ejaculation of despair, Ann glided into the dining-room, while Mr. Knight approached where I stood. The mere instant that had elapsed had been sufficient to restore his equanimity. With the utmost <foreign xml:lang="FRA">sang froid,</foreign> he exclaimed: "Thanks, Miss Bradshaw. What an admirable thing is self-control! Here is Ann half out of her wits because the draught extinguished her light. I trust I have not disturbed your slumbers; but I missed my note-book, and knowing that I must have dropped it here, I felt obliged to proceed in its quest, at the risk of disturbing the family, as I leave before sunrise to-morrow, or rather to-day, as I believe it is a little past twelve."</p> 
               <p>Dumb-founded at this cool audacity, I stood uncertain what to do or say, when the noise of a carriage, driven rapidly over the flagging of the court, interrupted the colloquy. There was a confused sound of voices, the clang of falling steps. Ann cried, "Fly, John; Nugent's here," as she disappeared up the stairs.</p> 
               <p>An amused, relieved expression passed over the Lothario's face. "Well, Jessie," he murmured, arching his eyebrows, and scornfully curling his handsome lips, "here's a pretty to do; but Ann urged me to this step. We've come vastly near a farce, if not a tragedy. I must fain obey the fair nymph's behest, or Dwight may hear scandal. Nugent will be too drunk to tell tales, but there seems to be a number with him. Lock this door after me. Bon soir. May angels bless you." Lightly clasping my hand, he passed out at the front entrance. Obeying the order I had received, I turned the key. By this time, the whole house was in commotion. Strong men were bearing Mr. Nugent to his chamber. He had been brought home very ill, in a terrible state; his wild cries and groans were fearful to hear. Physicians were summoned, but the raving continued unabated. It was necessary to restrain him in order to prevent personal injury. Catching the sound of my voice, as his attendants were striving to induce him to swallow a soothing draught, the wretched man called out: "Give it to Mrs. Raymond; I will drink it from her hand; quaff the bitter cup to the dregs. Call Mrs. Raymond; she will be my good angel, my preserver!"</p> 
               <p>Bewildered, uncertain, the men gazed at each other in mute astonishment. I well understood whom Mr. Nugent meant. Could I enter that loathed presence? could I minister to such a debased, fallen creature? "Mr. Raymond would have done so; your Saviour would have done so!" whispered an inward voice. Summoning courage, I went into the chamber and drew towards the bed.</p> 
               <p>Could that bloated, fiendish carcass be the once good-looking, gentlemanly Mr. Nugent? the man that Raymond had called friend?</p> 
               <p>The besotted man recognized me immediately. "Give me the draught, Jessie. I'll drink it for your sake and Raymond's. If Ann had been like you, I should never have seen this hour."</p> 
               <p>"Your salvation ought not to have depended upon her, or that of any other earthly being," I answered, as I handed the medicine.</p> 
               <p>"Eve gave the apple to Adam and he ate of it, Jessie. I was bad enough when I married my last wife, God and devil both know; and they both know how much worse she has made me. The devil knows; but, thank heaven, he has fast hold of her, fast hold both of her and her paramour. Jessie, I am not as bad as John Knight! My sins have all been honorable and above board. I have been my worst enemy. Tell Raymond so; you will see him in that other country; but I shall be across that gulf. Lazarus may not come to quench the heat of my parched tongue. Eternal torment of the damned! I begin to comprehend it, dear lady. But I am not wholly bad; there is a yearning for something better; there is, Jessie! Now life is ebbing, things put on a new aspect. Can there be mercy for such as I? say, can there be?"</p> 
               <p>I gazed pitifully into the glaring, fiery eyes and repeated the old, ever new story of the thief on the cross.</p> 
               <p>"Yes, I remember," was the faint response.</p> 
               <p>I asked if he would like to see a clergyman.</p> 
               <p>"No" (the tight grasp tightened over my hand); "only you! Sing me a hymn; sing those you used to sing to Raymond."</p> 
               <p>I complied, and the sick man was soothed into partial unconsciousness; but this continued but a short time; the spasms and raving returned. It was with the greatest difficulty that four strong men kept their patient in bed; these paroxysms were followed by partial returns of reason, when the despair and misery were inconceivably distressing, terrible both to witness and hear. The poor man's only comfort seemed to come from my presence; holding my hand, he would cry: "Avaunt, avaunt, ye foul spirits; I am with her, with nobleness, with purity and charity; ye cannot come here. Raymond, send them away, send them away. In vain, in vain! There is the gulf!" crouching back with glaring eyeballs, "there is the gulf!" In a terrible whisper, that thrilled every nerve, clutching me tighter as he spoke, "Save me, save me, Jessie! No, no! It cannot be! Farewell, farewell!"</p> 
               <p>Then the wretched creature would sink back exhausted, helpless, till again racked by tremor and convulsion.</p> 
               <p>Aunt Sukey, upon ascertaining the state of affairs, had summoned Dwight. Mr. Nugent recognized him immediately, and he was of great service through the three terrible days that the degraded, rent soul wrestled with the wronged, debased body. On the morning of the fourth, the spirit, naked and miserable, passed into the unknown realms that lie beyond mortal ken. Into that great hereafter of the Eternal, sin blighted, sin freighted, it must stand, as from birth it had stood, before its Maker. That Maker, who knew it, knew its opportunities, its temptations, its weaknesses and its hereditary bias,-knew them so much better than any fellow-creature; that Maker, who is a God pf love as well as a God of justice. The soul is before its Father as well as its Judge. We will not seek to pierce the future, but in trembling awe, pray to be "kept from temptation and delivered from evil."</p> 
               <p>A severe nervous headache, followed by great prostration, kept me in Charlestown, whither I had accompanied Polly Brown, till the day of the funeral. Dust having been committed to dust, I called on the widow. She looked very lovely in her weeds, and though still cowed and tremulous, there were glimpses of inward joy for which I was at no loss to account.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Norton was with her daughter, but Ann drew me aside to beg my forbearance respecting the events of the evening of my arrival. "I was very wrong; now I am truly glad things turned as they did; but do not be too hard upon me, Jessie. You don't know what it is to be tied to such a man as Nugent. I can't mourn for him, but I mean to observe the utmost decorum. I have decided to return with mother;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6399-00000109"/> to remain secluded in the country till it is proper for John to claim me."</p> 
               <p>I promised discreet silence, with the fear that the union to which Ann looked forward with such glad certainty would never be consummated, Few men will marry a woman they have ceased to respect, least of all, such a man as John Knight. This fear increased, when it was announced that Mr. Nugent had died insolvent. Then came Ann's time to mourn; a time when sombre garb did not belie the disappointed, melancholy face.</p> 
               <p>"I have been a fool, a worse than fool, Jessie," she passionately, exclaimed, at my last visit on the morning of my return home. "I sold myself to that beast, and if I could have had my wages, the money that I counted so upon for my happiness with John, I could have borne everything; but here I am a beggar, obliged to return to father; I should rather have died than to go back in poverty to that horrid town, to become the topic for tea-table gossip in every house in the parish. Don't you think John will come or write soon? I shall die if he does not; I believe I am growing old and yellow even now."</p> 
               <p>I glanced at the pearl powder and carmine saucer upon the toilet table by which I sat, and in a few words of serious friendly admonition, took my leave of the weak, vacillating, disheartened woman.</p> 
               <p>With the secret I possessed, the slight intimacy which family and neighborhood had engendered, must now cease between Ann and myself; still I determined to keep an eye over her country seclusion. Wayward, unprincipled, unhappy, she was not to be trusted. For once, I clearly saw that, in a measure, I had been placed my "brother's keeper."</p> 
               <p>Notwithstanding my prolonged stay in Boston, owing to Aunt Sukey's activity the new home was ready on the appointed day for its occupants.</p> 
               <p>My aunt's visit, at this juncture was indeed most opportune. Her advice and practical good sense proved invaluable, while her open purse and ready, helping hands smoothed many difficulties. Limited means, with calico a dollar a yard, and moderate-sized mirrors, at sixteen dollars, and crockery and glass in proportion, was somewhat of an annoyance; but thanks to my kind relative, every thing was made easy. Her gifts, and other wedding presents, in addition to the parsonage fixtures, gave to the old tavern not only a neat, cheerful, but even a genteel aspect.</p> 
               <p>"When Uncle John learned that my nuptial day was appointed, he insisted upon the ceremonies being performed at South-end. "A daughter of the house, it was fitting that I should go thence to that of my husband."</p> 
               <p>Accordingly, on a sunny November morn, the old brown house was put in festive array. Friendly hands robed me in my best white India muslin, which Peggy had done up in her unapproachable style (I would not incur the expense of a new gown), Ruthy arranged my hair, as only her skilful fingers could dress it, Aunt Sukey clasped Dwight's mother's pearls (which I wore at his special request), Mira and Miss Kate Donaldson fastened the veil and orange blossoms, presents from Madam Sprague; Miss Betty, Polly Brown and James helped grandma'am and Aunt Nabby to cut the cake and decant the wine; our little chatterbox, Addy, was hushed into a decorous silence; the company gathered in the great parlor, and on the spot where my parents had plighted their bridal vows, Dwight's and mine were consecrated. Dr. Parkinson, in fulfilment of an old promise, made to him when I was his boarder, performed the ceremony. The few brief, solemn words were spoken, the twain pronounced one, one before God and man, one for time, one for eternity.</p> 
               <p>At the close of a merry hour, preparations were commenced for our ride to town. As I stepped forth, what was my surprise to find Peacock at the door. I glanced to Dwight for an explanation.</p> 
               <p>"He is your horse now, ma chere, as I have just promised to endow you with all my worldly goods. I did not deem any other horse worthy to bear home my bride."</p> 
               <p>Though speech was impossible, I did not the less appreciate the delicate affection that had dictated this new gratification.</p> 
               <p>Miss Betty had insisted upon receiving the bridal party at dinner, and in the evening, Aunt Rutledge's spacious and elegant drawing-rooms were, for the last time, opened to the assembled family and a few choice friends.</p> 
               <p>Altogether, my wedding-day was a much pleasanter and gayer one than I had anticipated. Dwight pronounced it an exception to the general rule; he was happy to say it had been a joyous wedding, without one attendant drawback or sadness.</p> 
               <p>The morning after my bridal, Mr. Carnes sent me the mare, Jenny, which in a polite, friendly note, he begged me to accept, with his sincerest wishes for my future happiness.</p> 
               <p>This was the most valuable present I had received; still I did not hesitate at its acceptance, feeling that I thus conferred more than I received.</p> 
               <p>The young man was about departing for Ohio, then the promised land of our New England wanderers. A few days after my marriage, he came to bid us adieu. "You must permit me to retain this ring, Mrs. Sprague," he said, extending his hand. "With God's blessing, it has been a sure talisman."</p> 
               <p>Dwight and I hastened to bid him keep it, to keep it always; and with strengthened hope, bade our friend good-by, with a "Godspeed" upon his new undertaking.</p> 
               <p>One wedding often paves the way for another. Squire Montgomery met Bethia Brown at the wedding party at my aunt's, and instantly fell in love with her. The passion, happily, was this time mutual, and before Christmas, the pretty Bethia became installed as Mrs. Montgomery in the house James had formerly occupied.</p> 
               <p>Thus her mother's prediction became verified, and the match caused such an unusual amount of visiting on Mrs. Brown's part, that the good woman and her baby really became objects of alarm even to that tea-drinking community. Aunt Judy declared, "That between Thanksgiving and New Year, Miss Brown had travelled a hundred mile if she had one, and lugged that great boy every step. It was well that Susy, the third darter, was a second Polly, or she didn't know what would become of the family."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXV.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE WAR OF 1812.</head> 
               <p>MOST expect an accession of care and responsibility at marriage; but few at the outset, are called to the discharge of such onerous duties as those in my province.</p> 
               <p>It had been supposed that Peggy, in reality, would become the head of the establishment; on the contrary, she who had been so perfectly <foreign xml:lang="FRA">au fait</foreign> at the parsonage, was now often completely at a loss in the tavern. I had also feared that her imperious dictation might interfere with the management of the other domestics; but this was also a mistake. Mrs. Sprague immediately became an object of as respectful<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6399-00000110"/> ful deference as Madam Compton had ever elicited.</p> 
               <p>It was only at times, in private, that "Jessie" received an outburst of happiness, when the Lord was invariably thanked for his favors; "but she did hope he would have the grace to set us in a private sitiwation again some day."</p> 
               <p>Dwight kept an excellent orderly house, and company began to flock to it. Though my husband had provided a professed cook, and every other convenience, I must own that, at first, I was often at my wit's end. Never could I sufficiently thank those who, notwithstanding my elevated position, had given me a practical knowledge of domestic affairs in childhood.</p> 
               <p>As the winter advanced, the travel increased; and with snow, came country pungs, loaded with pigs, poultry, butter, cheese, apple-sauce, dried apples, grass-seed, peas, beans, homespun cloth, yarn, etc. In good sleighing, a dozen of these teams would drive to the door in a line. Then it was that I discovered the good calculation that had dictated the occupancy of the stand. All of these farmers loaded back with dry goods, fish and groceries, which were furnished at the store.</p> 
               <p>I had not expected my genteel friends to notice me; on the contrary, I was overwhelmed with callers.</p> 
               <p>The tavern was on the fashionable drive, and just a pretty walk from town; it was pleasant to chat over my cake and wine, and condole with me on my cares.</p> 
               <p>As it was impossible to sustain such a visiting list, I quietly condensed it to my immediate circle; but the winter brought many visitors to my private parlor. Many of our country traders brought wives and daughters to see town life and fashions; these became my especial care, I must attend them on shopping excursions and otherwise entertain them. Peggy often declared "She didn't see how I lived through it," and I sometimes wondered myself. A cheerful spirit is a great support. We were making money; James and Dwight were jubilant at their success.</p> 
               <p>Then there were quiet, genial hours, rendered almost paradisaical from contrast; hours when my husband would join me in my pleasant parlor, to steal the time to paint on a portrait of our darling Adelaide; and happy evenings, when cold or storms preventing transient company, the whole household would be invited thitherto listen, while he read aloud from some useful or entertaining book.</p> 
               <p>This practical acknowledgment of his brotherhood to his dependants, became the means of attaching them strongly to him. I have little sympathy with those that find so much trouble in housekeeping. The winter was spent by the Rutledge family in preparation for their departure to the South. It must have been a severe trial to my aunt thus to leave home and kindred; but her feelings were heroically concealed. Mira was sanguine respecting her projected school, and the younger children anticipated change with the buoyancy of youth.</p> 
               <p>It was not till they were handed on board the "Two Sisters," Capt. Cole, that plied between our port and Georgetown, D. C., that I realized the loss I was to sustain. How doubly dear had each one become; even Judy Short's square visage-the good creature still clung to my aunt-looked beautiful at that sad moment. I watched them over the bar from Miss Betty's upper windows, watched till the vessel be came a speck on the horizon, then vanished altogether.</p> 
               <p>As war with England was declared a short time after, we were necessarily anxious respecting our friends, and the news of their safe arrival was hailed with no slight joy. Our fears had not been groundless. I copy from Mira's first letter:</p> 
               <p>"We suffered from sea sickness and the confinement of the small cabin, and with pleasure received the tidings one fine morning, that in two days we should be in Georgetown.</p> 
               <p>"As I went on deck, I espied a large vessel evidently making towards the brig. Capt. Cole watched her through his glass in silence, but as she approached, I descried the British colors. What did it mean? Had war been declared? The captain feared so, but hoped that he could outsail the larger craft. A few moments showed this a mistake; the frigate rapidly gained upon us, and a shot over our bows told the errand of the stranger. Our captain crowded sail, and ordered the passengers below, I obeyed reluctantly; the boys were refractory and retained their places. Mother was terribly alarmed as a second iron greeting came booming over the water; this was quickly followed by a third. Capt. Cole now deemed it prudent to 'heave to.' Nothing could have been more magnificent than the graceful vessel, as she glided up and proudly swept alongside, the white sails gleaming, the guns glistening,-everything in complete trim; her deck swarming with men, yet not a word spoken, not a sound to be heard save the boatswain's whistle.</p> 
               <p>"First came the question, 'What vessel?' next 'Where from?' 'Where bound?' Capt. Cole thundered the replies through his trumpet, then came the inquiry, 'With what laden?' Our John, like a precious, bold scamp as he is, seized the trumpet and shouted back, 'A few Yankee notions, such as women, children, and spinning-wheels.'</p> 
               <p>"Mother nearly lost her senses when she found we were to be boarded, and bundled the children away in the berths, beseeching me to bury myself in mine. I suggested that she had better follow her own advice, as she was in equal danger, to which, much to my amusement, I was assured that no one would notice an ugly old woman like her. Forty is not such a venerable age, and certainly the mother is much handsomer than the daughter, but fear had clouded Ma's usually clear judgment.</p> 
               <p>"Judy was too indignant to be scared. 'What did them dratted British mean? Hadn't they got enough thrashing once, without wanting to get licked agin? What bisness had they to stop an American vessel on the high seas? Dwight Sprague was right; we must fight 'em! the only wished we'd anything to fight with; she'd sarve the guns and we'd see who'd come off fust best!'</p> 
               <p>"Ma begged her not to talk so loud, and wondered how I could admire the elegant officer that had come on deck. Anxiety for her family had crushed her usual high spirit. It would have been rather inconvenient to have been bundled, bag and baggage, to Halifax. Only the slightest chance saved us. The declaration of war had passed the Senate, but the news of its ratification by the House had not reached the frigate; after an hour's delay, we were permitted to proceed. One half hour later we should have been prisoners of war.</p> 
               <p>"The sail up the bay and river was charming. Papa awaited us at Alexandria with a carriage, and that night found us again established in a home. We occupy a convenient house, commanding a, delightful view of Georgetown, the Potomac, and the adjacent city.</p> 
               <p>"Washington, though as yet still a city of 'magnificent distances,' more a village than a city, will, in time, become a splendid metropolis.</p> 
               <p>"Cousin Mary has been very kind.<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6399-00000111"/> I found a spacious school-room and twenty scholars awaiting my arrival. I commenced the first of the month, and the number has, in this short period, nearly doubled.</p> 
               <p>"We find ourselves in a very desirable circle; nothing can exceed the hospitable friendliness of our new associates; but every hour shows us that we are strangers in an undiscovered country; that being in Rome, we must learn to live like the Romans. The air and manners, the pronunciation and accent, the whole tone of thought and feeling, are at variance with that to which we have been accustomed. Though receiving the kindest courtesy, still I can detect in the tone of society a pride of Southern birth and breeding, mingled with a slight scorn for their more Northern neighbors. The old cavalier disdain for the equally proud, though more homespun, Puritan.</p> 
               <p>"Eddy has already been obliged to wage battle for New England. A spoiled little specimen of chivalry, having taken a miff, persisted in calling him Yankee tank! Yankee tank!' Eddy bore this awhile with the patience befitting his mother's Christian precepts, but at length his Round-head blood overcame precept, and after a warning 'to stop, or he would be sorry,' little cavalier was knocked down, the breath fairly knocked out of him for a moment. Sonny was terribly scared; declares he thought he had killed the saucebox; but I do not think our boys will again be molested.</p> 
               <p>"Then the blacks are a novelty; a constant source of amusement or annoyance.</p> 
               <p>"The week after our arrival, Cousin Mary invited me to spend a few days with her. The first evening of my visit, I retired early with a bad headache. I had scarcely got composed for sleep, when the door opened, and a fat negress rolled a mattress to the foot of my bed and proceeded to ensconce herself upon it. In vain I rebelled,-petitioned Cousin Mary that I might be left alone. 'She could not hear of it? Sleep without a servant with that headache! Impossible; it could not be permitted!' Finding remonstrance vain, I submitted with the best grace I could assume.</p> 
               <p>"Mary left, and Celia laid herself down. I was beginning to doze, when I was fully aroused by audible tokens that my handmaid had sunk into the arms of Morpheus.</p> 
               <p>"I bore the noise till my throbbing head was perfectly unendurable, then awoke her. Drowsily apologizing, she sank down again, and in five minutes was snoring louder than ever. What could I do? Bear it, of course, as I best might; but not one wink of sleep visited my eyes on this first night's experience of Southern ladyism.</p> 
               <p>"Many families are wholly governed in their domestic affairs by a black mammy. She has grown up with the mistress, nursed the children, and holds as undisputed sway in the household as the greatest autocrat in the universe. Others have an Uncle Jerry or Pomp to rule them. Many of the servants are foster-brothers and sisters of their master and mistress, and the children all grow up together.</p> 
               <p>"I am speaking of town life; as yet, I know nothing of that on the plantation, but in my short experience, I have arrived at the conclusion that we Northerners can scarcely understand this domestic institution of the South. Some of its features are revolting, others quite the reverse. Upon the whole, I think it would be difficult to find a happier or more jovial people than the negroes. Heedless as children, casting the present and future upon their masters, musical, fun-loving, with strong devotional and reverential instincts, of the two, I believe the whites, with their care and responsibility, are the greatest objects for pity. Ma is horrified at the thriftlessness of both whites and blacks. I think nearly every New England housekeeper would join in her wonder.</p> 
               <p>"The walls of our parlor are white, hard finished. As Ma thought it too laborious for Judy to scour them, she hired a free negress. As the job was declared done in half the usual time, Ma went to inspect the room. What was her indignation at finding the wall cleaned but half-way to the ceiling. Much provoked, she set Nance to work again, keeping a strict oversight of her proceedings. The woman was exceedingly angry; declared 'anybody might see Missus Rutledge was nuffing but a Yankum <emph>woman.</emph> A Southern <emph>lady</emph> would never have known whether the plaster was cleaned or not.'</p> 
               <p>"I find that change of scene has modified many of my ideas. Dwight will be happy to learn that I have found some genteel Democrats, and that I have discovered that Federalists can be fallible.</p> 
               <p>"How he would have laughed at the chagrin with which I played wall-flower at a party soon after my arrival, when my Federalist pride caused me to refuse a Democratic partner. A rising young man and an 'F. F. V.' Oh! Ah! Only to think what I may have lost by this martyrdom to New England prejudice! Isn't it lamentable? I was somewhat compensated for the otherwise dull evening towards; its close, by the approach of Mrs. Patterson Bonaparte and the Spanish minister. Taking chairs next mine, they carried on a lively conversation for some moments.</p> 
               <p>"These distinguished personages little dreamed that the Yankee school-ma'am understood the French in which they spoke, next to her mother tongue; but I shall not reveal state; secrets. Mrs. Patterson resides near us, living in quiet, almost seclusion. Her whole time is devoted to the education of her little prince, as she fondly terms her boy. Father says she is as fair, though graver and quieter, as when he first saw her, at the period of her marriage.</p> 
               <p>"Among my scholars, is a pretty, petted child, named Mary Morton. To-day, her mother rode in from her plantation in Maryland to call upon me. Not till she spoke of you had I imagined her to be Mr. Raymond's Nellie. She is a pale, faded woman, a widow with this one child. I found her very pleasant and companionable, and she expressed a strong regard for you, coupled with a wish for your personal acquaintance. I am much interested in her.</p> 
               <p>"Isn't it singular how we have become mixed with this romance! What strange things meet us as we proceed through life! Surely, truth is stranger than fiction."</p> 
               <p>In Federal New England, the war was most unpopular. This must not be such matter for wonder when we consider its disastrous consequences to that section. Think of the deprivations, to a people who, not looking with prophetic vision over the length and breadth of the land, gazed with bounded sight only at that portion which was compelled to bear most of its ill effects. Trade previously had been greatly impeded by decrees, orders in council, non-intercourse and embargo.</p> 
               <p>The war brought the climax of misfortune. Vessels decayed at the wharves, store-houses fell into ruin, seamen loitered about the silent commercial marts, everything wore a disheartening appearance.</p> 
               <p>In every, sea-port town there was much dismay and distress. All kinds of labor was impeded, work could not be obtained by the most industrious; in many families poverty took the place of plenty, and idleness and misfortune<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6399-00000112"/> were too often attended by drunkenness and misery.</p> 
               <p>Many a noble man, overcome by circumstances, became a mere wreck of his former self; many a delicately nurtured lady descended into the unthrifty, slatternly household drudge, while their children, born to such a different sphere, half-clad and half-fed, ran wild amongst the very dregs of the population.</p> 
               <p>Little wonder that so many, looking back to the prosperous days succeeding the Revolution, shook their heads despairingly, prophesying the ruin of the country.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Donaldson, among so many other of our chief merchants, who had stemmed every adverse tide, was the last to succumb.</p> 
               <p>Bravely had the shrewd merchant breasted the storm with consummate skill, had tacked through every difficulty, but the war threw him high and dry on a lee shore.</p> 
               <p>Old and broken-hearted, he retired to his farm, where the unconsciousness of a second childhood relieved his latter days from care. Madam Donaldson's decease soon followed that of her husband, and Miss Kate was left alone, penniless, but not friendless.</p> 
               <p>"I can take care of myself," said the brave little woman. "Mrs. Lowe is to be married; I shall take her school. Do not be concerned for me. I shall do very well." A prediction that was fully realized.</p> 
               <p>"It is an ill-wind that blows no one good." The war that brought ruin to hundreds, proved a perfect "Godsend" to us.</p> 
               <p>The summer of 1813, brought throngs of teams, that continued to arrive during the contest.</p> 
               <p>British manufacturers, having quantities of goods upon their hands, ran cargo after cargo into their eastern provinces; thence they were passed across the border, and taken south in carts drawn by oxen. As our accommodations were excellent for such teams, the tavern became a permanent headquarters.</p> 
               <p>Dozens of these carts would be drawn in a line by the stables as evening approached; their motley coverings consisting of patchwork bed covers, coverlets, etc., forming a singularly grotesque mlange.</p> 
               <p>These teams were loaded with every species of merchandise, from the richest lace to the coarsest fabrics. Gunpowder and other ammunition was also frequently transported.</p> 
               <p>Smuggling became a regular vocation. Dwight and James were often called in the dead of night, to stealthily admit the most ludicrously disguised persons, to stow away articles of great value in the most out-of-the-way places. As my womanly wit and invention were convenient, I was more than once summoned to these secret conclaves, but never without much protestation at such unlawful proceedings.</p> 
               <p>Dwight declared, that such a good Federalist ought to joyfully embrace the opportunity to cheat such a horrible government,-one so blind to the honor of the country, so bent upon its destruction. "He wondered how I could wear those silk gloves; they certainly were smuggled."</p> 
               <p>"What should I do? I could get no others."</p> 
               <p>"Go bare-handed, of course; one ought to live up to their convictions."</p> 
               <p>I assured my lord and master that my convictions did not reach martyrdom; but if wheels, looms, and knitting-needles had not been kept busy, even with this contraband trade, people must have suffered for the necessaries of life? But this secret traffic engendered many laughable scenes, James became the hero of quite an adventure.</p> 
                
               <p>Having received notice that a parcel of linen was awaiting his order at the "Kennebunk wharves," as the port of Kennebunk was then designated, he hurried up from the store, determined not to trust it in other hands than his own.</p> 
               <p>Dwight was from home, but after consultation, it was decided to harness Peacock and Jenny to a strong farm-wagon. James having accoutred himself in a gray spencer, rather scant in measure, belonging to one of our hired men, drew over it an old overcoat, minus several buttons, their absence being supplied by a red surcingle. An old slouched hat and a pair of woollen mittens completed his costume.</p> 
               <p>I feared that this outr dress, coupled with such valuable horses, might elicit remark; but with a gay laugh, my cousin sprang to his seat, and the high-spirited animals dashed forward. Turk had been loitering round the door, but, as he seldom left home, I had not thought of his following; but half an hour afterward, much to my chagrin, I found it to be the case. Somewhat disturbed, as the dog was a rather noted beast, I anxiously awaited events. The third evening from that of his departure, brought the welcome rumble of wheels, and James' hilarious tones showed that all was right. A large hogshead, marked "Rum," filled the wagon, which was driven to the barn and unloaded. Turk, quite tired out, sought his nook beside my parlor fire, whither he was followed by his two masters.</p> 
               <p>"How did you get on?" I inquired of my husband, as he carefully closed the door. "Haven't you had any trouble?"</p> 
               <p>"None, I only had a hairbreadth escape, just enough to give zest to the expedition," Mr. Lee replied, with a laugh. "I really consider myself worthy a place in the 'Custom House.' On arriving at the wharves I proceeded according to direction and found the goods stored in the warehouse of a retired sea-captain, who seems to be doing a brisk business. As he is an importer, the linen was packed in an empty rum-cask, but, as upon search, the certificate to this one was not to be found, another was adroitly altered. It was now late into the night, and my new friend took me home where I was entertained most hospitably. The next morning, the cask was hoisted into the wagon,-there seemed to be plenty of hands ready, several very gentlemanly young men being quite willing to put a shoulder to the wheel.</p> 
               <p>"It was nearly noon before every thing had been completed, and, by some mischance I took the lower road; finding my mistake, and wishing to avoid the ferry at Portsmouth, I inquired the way of a young fellow that I met. A cigar won his good offices, and he volunteered to lead the way through a crossroad that turned on to the upper route.</p> 
               <p>"Night had closed in; our path led through dense woods; an early snow, that elsewhere had vanished, covered the ground; here and there we came upon a little clearing, a log hut looming up amid the blackening stumps, its one or two small windows radiant from the pine knot within, and crowded with faces, that the crunch of the wagon through the snow had drawn thither.</p> 
               <p>"The main route having been gained, I bade adieu to my, conductor, and drove forward till past midnight, when coming to a large tavern, I halted. My repeated knocks at length brought a boy's head to the window, who shouted ''taint the teamsters, Mr. Smith; it's a man.'</p> 
               <p>"After further parley the door opened, and the landlord came forth with apologies for the delay. They were troubled with some teamsters from the back settlements, who only came to warm<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6399-00000113"/> themselves and get a drink, and the lad had been directed not to disturb the house by their admittance. A lantern having been brought, the horses were stabled, and Turk and I sat down to a good supper. By the way, I could not drive him back; he was determined to help me through my job. I wish half the men had his sense.</p> 
               <p>"The meal over, I was lighted up stairs. 'There are three other gentlemen in the chamber you are to occupy, but you will find an empty bed,' said the attentive landlord. True, there was an 'empty bed,' but the occupants of the two others had stripped it of every article of covering excepting the sheets. Making virtue of necessity, I quietly slipped in alongside of the solitary sleeper in the second couch. It was scarcely dawn when my light slumbers were broken by the rising of the occupants of the first bed. After they had gone down, I rose and dressed without disturbing my bed-fellow. As preparations for breakfast had commenced, I sat down by the bar-room fire to wait for a cup of coffee. As I did so, one of my room-mates said to the other, 'that fellow up stairs has been to Portsmouth and got a Custom House commission.' I could not forbear a start. There I had been snoozing beside an officer of the customs, having taken his bed by storm."</p> 
               <p>"Ha, ha, pretty good," cried Dwight. "What did you do,-cut and run?"</p> 
               <p>"Not exactly, but I concluded to drive on a few miles before breakfasting. Just as the wagon was brought to the door, who should appear but our government appointee. Eyeing the team with a scrutinizing air, he bade me good morning.</p> 
               <p>"'Fine horses, sir; a handsome dog. From the eastward, I presume?'</p> 
               <p>"'Won't you take a cigar, sir?' I returned, handing him a choice Havana. As my Captain at the 'Wharves' had given me a couple of bunches, I could afford to be liberal.</p> 
               <p>"'Thank you, sir,' he replied, eyeing me more fixedly, 'have you cigars to sell?'</p> 
               <p>"'Oh, no; only a few to while away the time and present to a friend,' I replied, handing him some half dozen.</p> 
               <p>"'Ah, yes, much obliged; where are you taking that liquor? Seems to me that cask scarcely looks reliable.'</p> 
               <p>"I was exactly of that opinion, but being too hurried to answer questions, with a hasty good morning, I mounted the box, and lost no time in putting the ground between me and my inquisitive acquaintance."</p> 
               <p>"Pretty good, what happened next?"</p> 
               <p>"Nothing, till I reached Hampton, when the transom-bolt broke just before the tavern. I went down between the wheels, but received only a slight jar. The whole village rushed to the rescue. I was provoked at the untoward circumstance, but the blacksmith soon repaired the damage. I could not help feeling slightly 'skeery' as Peggy says, however, when the officious, good-natured hostler came forth, with hammer and wedge, to drive the hoops of the cask for fear it should leak.</p> 
               <p>"'We won't lose any of the good stuff, Major,' he said, as he mounted into the wagon. 'Darn the old thing,' he continued, much to my trepidation, 'It's a trump anyhow; if ever I see sich a rickety thing hold out like that. Why thunder and tow, its calked here with oakum. Fireation, why don't it weep out! Well, I must say that beats the Dutch!' You may judge that I was glad to resume the road."</p> 
               <p>Dwight laughed heartily. After supper, the linen was unpacked and conveyed to the store.</p> 
               <p>Money continued to flow in at both house and store. Meantime, the din of arms began to disturb the quiet neighborhood. Two British cruisers appeared off the harbor, and our citizens awoke to the necessity of defence. Militia companies were drilled, a fort was hastily thrown up on Plum Island, and manned by volunteers; the fife and drum resounded at all hours; the panic-struck community became alive with martial demonstrations.</p> 
               <p>That autumn we were surprised by the return of Jake. The boy had experienced unheard of hardships and adventures. In a West India port he had been pressed on board an English ship; after a time he managed to escape from her in a Spanish port and swim to an American brig that was anchored at half a mile's distance. After several transfers and romantic adventures, he arrived safe in our port, in a little privateer, that, with several others, did an active business, thus giving employment to many of the seafaring loungers that had so long thronged the wharves.</p> 
               <p>Jake, notwithstanding his Shoals nativity, had had enough of sea-life. The sailor was completely killed, and he became our factotum both in-doors and out, at the house and the store.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXVI.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE BURNING OF THE CAPITOL.</head> 
               <p>DURING the war, intercourse with our Southern friends became necessarily infrequent; but the information we did receive was highly satisfactory. Mira's school prospered beyond expectation, and my uncle's business was better than had been anticipated. Much to his satisfaction, he was able to share in James' payments.</p> 
               <p>Time sped, and the conflict, with its splendid naval triumphs, progressed. Perry's victory on Lake Erie was celebrated with an amount of din suitable to such an occasion. The success of the American arms in Canada inspirited the people. The Democrats were enthusiastic; the Federalists began to talk of prosecuting affairs with more vigor, when the humiliating news of the capture of Washington, and the destruction of the public buildings was received.</p> 
               <p>The old Revolutionary blood was stirred! This was not to be endured. Every one, excepting the most rabid anti-war men, began to show fight. The women, as usual, took up the heroic side. This insult must be avenged! Mira sent a most graphic account of the burning of the Capitol.</p> 
               <p>She wrote: "You may judge with what anxiety and apprehension the approach of the British was watched by our citizens; but it had never been 'conceived, till the morning of the twenty-third, that the honor of the American arms would not be maintained, and the Capitol of the country gallantly defended.</p> 
               <p>"Early on that day, it was rumored that our troops had been defeated at Bladensburg. Soon this report was confirmed by the appearance of the retreating militia. Squad after squad of soldiers passed in rapid flight during the morning. The panic became general; most of our neighbors packed their valuables, and started for the country. Washington was fast becoming depopulated. My school-room was deserted. Father was urged to place his goods in greater security, but he wisely considered the removal would be equal to a raid from the enemy. As the hours wore on, things grew darker and darker; there had been one continued retreat through the day. Everything in the shape of an animal or a vehicle had been pressed into service; it was a most incongruous and miscellaneous procession. Dwight ought to have had the pleasure of sketching it; there<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6399-00000114"/> might have been a rival of Hogarth's 'March to Tinchly.'</p> 
               <p>"It was nearly four o'clock; the stream of passers had greatly diminished, nearly the whole of the more aristocratic population had decamped, when the cry rose, 'The President! The President!'</p> 
               <p>"Could it be possible? Yes; on came the carriage. Mr. Madison occupied the back seat. Owing to the heat he had doffed his hat; we saw him distinctly. The coach dashed past, leaving us to gaze at each other in blank amazement.</p> 
               <p>"John was terribly indignant. 'Catch Yankees to let the President run away if they were all Federalists!'</p> 
               <p>"Father's military spirit was roused. 'Never was a building better located for defence than the Capitol. If the soldiers had spent the day in intrenching, something might have been done!' Too much excited for repose, the good man paced uneasily to and fro. As evening drew on, the report arrived that the iron-works were in a blaze. As both guns and ammunition were cast there, we had anticipated this result, but it was soon found that this rumor was false; without a halt, the army pressed forward directly to the city. It was about eight in the evening when it became occupied by the advanced guard, and in an hour, the ascending flames told us that the work of destruction had commenced.</p> 
               <p>"We had not looked for this,-had never conceived that Englishmen would commit such an uncalled-for act of vandalism.</p> 
               <p>"We feminines shed a few tears of mingled sorrow and vexation; the masculines were furiously impotent. Really, it was almost too much for brave men thus to be compelled to stand helplessly gazing at the conflagration of so much that can never be replaced.</p> 
               <p>"I mounted the portico, where father and John stood with clenched hands, and set teeth through which came mutterings not loud but deep.</p> 
               <p>"It was a still, sultry, moonlight night; not a breath swayed the flames, which rose up straight, mighty pillars of fire, forming a most strange, a most magnificent sight. Gradually, they widened and brightened, till the Capitol, the buildings of the several departments, and the bridge over the Potomac, were wrapt in one sheet of fire. There we stood and gazed as though it had been a play upon a stage; stood with a sort of benumbed feeling, almost thinking that it must be some horrible nightmare from which we should presently awake; but alas, we were at length compelled to turn from the sinking flames, with the assurance that it was indeed a too vivid reality. That we had been witnessing a great historic event, which must not only impugn the courage of our countrymen but cast disgrace upon our triumphant foe.</p> 
               <p>"At a late hour for them, but still while the flames were at their height, our boys had been reluctantly driven to bed; but in the early dawn, while we elders were snatching a morning nap, they rose, and having surreptitiously arrayed themselves in their last winter's scarlet suits, under the impression that these would permit them to pass unchallenged, they sallied forth into the enemy's quarters in search of adventure.</p> 
               <p>"Much to our relief, before breakfast was quite over, they marched in, full of importance, and laden with spoil which they had picked up among the ruins; half-burnt charts, rulers, paper, knives, etc.</p> 
               <p>"According to their account, they had elicited considerable notice. One splendid officer had patted Eddy's head, with the inquiry if he would not like to be a soldier? to which our hopeful ful responded, 'that he was one; didn't he see his red clothes? and that he should have worn his papa's sword, only it was hanging in his chamber and he couldn't reach it. That just as soon as ho was a man, he should Whip the British soundly for thus dastardly burning our Capitol.'</p> 
               <p>"Phil says this ridiculous speech, as might be expected, caused great merriment; but the officer in the superb uniform said he would give a round sum to own that Yankee boy; that he was made of the right stuff.</p> 
               <p>"This recital somewhat quieted Ma's fears. After all, they were civilized men; surely, these officers would not sanction rapine and murder. Still, we were not free from disquietude through the day, fearing that we might be disturbed by marauding parties; but none of the soldiers crossed into Georgetown.</p> 
               <p>"During the afternoon, the invaders met with an accident, which spread dismay throughout their ranks. On the approach of the British, the authorities at Washington had deposited a quantity of powder in a dry well, which was covered with plank. A party of the enemy had gathered about this well, smoking cigars, when a spark having fallen through a crevice, the powder ignited with a terrible explosion. Some of the group were killed, and several wounded.</p> 
               <p>"This accidental occurrence was regarded as a Yankee trick, and it spread both consternation and horror through the whole army. The Yankees were full of tricks; who knew but that the whole area was undermined! Terror multiplied terror, till a panic took possession of the troops, and they moved with both caution and fear.</p> 
               <p>"In the evening, this terror was heightened by the most terrific thunderstorm. Never anything was remembered equal to it. Glare succeeded glare,-perfect sheets of lightning; while the thunder roared, rattled, crashed and pealed; rain, mingled with hail, poured down like a second flood; and the wind blew a perfect tornado.</p> 
               <p>"The niggers all declared, 'the Lor Gor Ormity was taking up our side for sure'; and I am inclined to think that the British might; entertain something of the same opinion.</p> 
               <p>The fleet were driven from their moorings in the river, and dashed against each other, experiencing considerable damage; tents were overturned, horses broke loose: altogether, it was a fearful night.</p> 
               <p>"The morning brought the joyful news that the enemy was in full retreat. Before sunset, the rear guard had marched forth, and in a few hours, the last straggler had disappeared from its precincts.</p> 
               <p>"In the course of the week, the frightened population had generally retired, and matters regained somewhat of their usual routine.</p> 
               <p>"The joy experienced at the victorious defence of Baltimore, was heightened by the success of our arms at Plattsburg, and on Lake Champlain.</p> 
               <p>"Notwithstanding this success, the larger part of the Federalists still croaked, like so many birds of ill omen, over the destruction of the country, and the corruption and bad management of the government. The Hartford convention was held, and the delegates sent to the Capitol, when the tidings of the brilliant and decisive victory at New Orleans was received: which joyful event was speedily followed by the still more welcome news of peace."</p> 
               <p>It was amid the clamor and din of the noisy demonstrations of satisfaction at this issue, that my first-born saw the light. I had been brought very near the grave, but as soon as I could note my baby girl, I was certain<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6399-00000115"/> she could not live. Doctor, nurse and Peggy all laughed at the idea. "Never was there such a splendid baby." "Yes, true, too true, she was too beautiful, too transparently lovely for life. Note her breath, it grew fainter every moment." Dwight at length reluctantly acknowledged I was right, and Doctor Norcross gravely shook his be-wigged head in tardy acquiescence.</p> 
               <p>Peggy was terribly distressed. I begged her to be quiet. In silence, with feelings which none but those similarly afflicted can understand, Dwight and I watched the tranquil ebbing of the brief life that had brought such joy and hope. Watched till the hither shore was passed, and the angel safe on the other side. Safe on the heavenly shore! But, at that moment neither parent, such was our sorrow, could distinctly discern its peaceful shades. We could only see the lifeless little body, feel the desolation in our hearts. On the third day after, the tiny form was clad in the embroidered frock and cap over which I had spent so many happy, expectant hours, and there was a quiet gathering of relatives and friends; the man of God spoke the fitting words, then our darling's earthly body was laid beside that of Genevieve's by the river side. The new home had been sanctified by its first bereavement; henceforth there would be an angel in the household.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXVII.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE CITY HOME.</head> 
               <p>A MONTH had passed, when, one evening as I sat musing in the twilight, weak in body, and weaker in mind, inert and despondent, little Addy suddenly threw aside her playthings, and climbing the side of my chair, lovingly and soothingly laid her soft cheek on my shoulder, caressingly exclaiming "Pretty little aunty!" Then lifting her head, she peered with wide open, earnest eyes into mine, and gravely questioned, "Isn't heaven the bestest place, aunty?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, heaven is a place of unalloyed happiness."</p> 
               <p>"Then why do you grieve for baby Jessie? My mamma lives in heaven; she will take care of her, and you 've me."</p> 
               <p>True, sweet little rebuker and comforter. Clasping the dear child, I resolved to strive for more faith and strength in future.</p> 
               <p>The door hastily opened; my husband entered. He had received a summons the previous evening to wait upon his Uncle Sprague in Boston, and had gone thither that morning. This message had greatly excited our surprise and curiosity. As soon as Dwight's tender inquiries had been answered, I eagerly asked the news.</p> 
               <p>"Uncle Sprague's affairs are in a most desperate condition. I must return by express to-night. Only the greatest tact can keep him from ruin; but I think we shall weather the shoals; then our ship will sail prosperously forward. Business is coming up; things look extremely encouraging. The old gentleman has explained everything so openly and penitently that he has won both my respect and regard. I feel repaid for my forbearance, Jessie."</p> 
               <p>"I always thought that you would some day, but I did not expect this so soon. How has this ill luck come about?"</p> 
               <p>"In many ways that I cannot now explain, but the chief cause has been my uncle's inattention and carelessness; two things that I could scarcely comprehend; but his head-clerk says: 'Mr. Sprague has never had any heart for business since his daughter's death.'"</p> 
               <p>"I can readily conceive that; and Miss Kate speaks most despondingly of your Cousin Lucretia."</p> 
               <p>"My aunt told me that she feared it was a rapid consumption. Jessie, we must be children to our relatives! I have been maturing my plans on the road home. We must break up here, and move to Boston. I have talked it over with James and he acquiesces. Between us, I think we can maintain my uncle's credit, and establish a profitable business."</p> 
               <p>This was startling; but in less than six weeks the new plan was entered upon. Job and Peggy returned to the parsonage, whither the furniture was reconveyed. Again, the dear old things resumed their stand in the dear old rooms, and the parsonage was its old self.</p> 
               <p>A purchase was found for both tavern and store, and the new firm of "Sprague, Lee &amp; Sprague" went into active operation.</p> 
               <p>I remained at the parsonage till September; then, after a visit to Miss Betty, joined my husband in a fashionable boarding-house in the city. Addy had been left behind as a companion for Peggy; thus I suddenly became the possessor of that leisure for which I had often sighed since my marriage. Instead of a blessing, contrary to expectation, I soon found it a burthen; but as the money to defray the expense of furnishing a house could not then be well spared, I strove to drive away homesickness, but must confess to many miserable hours. In vain I scolded myself for this childishness. Was not the old dream of my girlhood realized? That dream which I had loved to indulge in the twilighted library, reclining in my favorite recess, and building for the distant future; building airy castles, which my heart told me had not all been too bright for truth. Yes, I was the beloved, trusted wife of the rising city merchant, the mistress of handsome apartments, no real need that was not supplied, the best society extending the hand of friendship, with the privilege of kneeling beside my husband in the old family pew at King's Chapel, surely I ought to be happy! I read and sewed; I walked,-striving to reburnish the narrow, dingy streets with the glory they had worn to my childish eyes. I visited, and strove to improve the varied opportunities for self-culture; still, the void was there; the feeling that I ought not thus to be playing the fine lady, while Dwight was immured in that uncongenial counting-house.</p> 
               <p>The loving penetration of my other half soon discovered this disquiet. "So I was dissatisfied with boarding?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes; home was a wife's sphere. God had set the solitary in families; a wife ought to be the head of a household; and instead of a curse, a proper amount of care and labor was one of the greatest blessings yet bestowed."</p> 
               <p>Dwight laughed, pulled my curls, and wished, "Every man possessed such e Madam Wisdom; he would look for a house on the morrow."</p> 
               <p>But the morrow brought sad tidings. Miss Betty, like her cousin, Madam Compton, had died instantly at the breakfast table,-dropped from her chair whilst taking her coffee as usual.</p> 
               <p>Shocked and grieved, we hastened to town, where I was detained till cold weather. With the exception of legacies to her domestics, I was my relative's sole legatee; thus, once more, I became the owner of a handsome property.</p> 
               <p>During a week's stay at the parsonage, I met Mrs. Nugent. She had grown peevish and slatternly, restless and discontented. John Knight's marriage, at this juncture, to a Southern heiress, increased her spleen.</p> 
               <p>"You can easily talk, Jessie," she fretfully exclaimed, as I vainly strove<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6399-00000116"/> to comfort and encourage. "You are happy; every wish has been gratified; you have the husband you love, and the money you needed. You little thought it, but I worshipped John Knight, and though I am sure he admired me, he would not propose. You thought I made that fuss about Dwight's miniature to plague you; but it was to excite John's jealousy. Instead of that, I angered Miss Kate, which resulted in my going to Haverhill and meeting Mr. Nugent. Well, if it was foreordained, as mother insists, before the world was, I do not see how I could help it."</p> 
               <p>"We are free agents, Ann; we have the power to choose for good as well as for evil."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, and I have decided to choose Jonas Prime."</p> 
               <p>"Ann," I remonstrated. "Do not make bad worse!"</p> 
               <p>"No, that is not my intention, Mrs. Wisdom. Jonas has enough money to take up the mortgage on father's farm, and make me equal to you and the rest"</p> 
               <p>"Has Parson Kirk wood a mortgage on the estate?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes; it was not obtained by fair means, if he is a minister. Father was going down hill fast enough without his giving a push. Well, as Peggy phrases it, he will be pope of this Hopkinson college, and little will the world heed such complaints as ours; little does he care what becomes of such poor sinners as we. I shall be comfortable with Jonas; happy, I never can be, but he dotes on the very ground on which I step."</p> 
               <p>"I begged Ann to consider,-to do nothing hastily. Every error could be retrieved; Polly Brown and I would always assist her to the utmost."</p> 
               <p>"Thank you, Mrs. Sprague. I shall endeavor to place myself above your benevolence. Dear me! how well I recollect father's once counting the I Browns a family as sure to come on the town, and here they are flourishing right over our heads. The lieutenant is one of the selectmen, and Joseph has been put on the school committee, and is talked of as the next candidate for General Court. Well, old Prime's dollars will put us straight, and Jonas will be just the dutiful husband I wish; let me have my own way, and adore me above everything else."</p> 
               <p>Words were useless. Like most weak-minded persons, Ann was persistently stubborn. John Knight had been right; her discernment was clear to worldly interests and advancement; no Solomon could be more sagacious.</p> 
               <p>A modest house near Fort Hill awaited my return to Boston. As housekeeping without Peggy was an impossibility, Hannah Mixer was transferred to the parsonage, and after a demur, which I knew was far from meaning dissent, my trusty serving-woman consented to accompany me to the city.</p> 
               <p>It was late in the afternoon of a dark, leaden autumn day that the stage deposited us at the door of our new residence. Peggy's face grew a study, as descending from the vehicle, and slowly gazing around, she took in the whole <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tout ensemble</foreign> of the narrow street, the high brick houses, the oblong of neutral cloud above and the pave beneath. With a stifled sigh, gathering box and bundle, giving an immense huff, the good dame ascended the steps and entered the spruce Liliputian hall, with its narrow winding staircase in front, and passage and stairs leading to the lower regions at the rear. The interior spectacle was not one to elevate the spirits of tired travellers. Passages, parlors and chambers were in the most bewildering confusion. Polly Brown's bright, cheery welcome was solid comfort. Grasping Peggy's box, she guided her down the dim stairs, with the assurance, that "The kitchen was warm and tidy, Dwight, James, Jake, and a maid were hard at work; the house would be quite habitable by bedtime."</p> 
               <p>"Habitable!" (a portentous huff) "Cellers and sky parlors? Pooty times, pooty days; well, she had never expected to burry like a mole, nor perch sky-high like an eagle! Hadn't the good Lord made the airth big enough that these Boston folks must imitate the tower of Babel?"</p> 
               <p>Seating her charge in a rocking-chair before the fire, Polly proceeded to untie her bonnet.</p> 
               <p>"Do you s'pose I've lost the use of my hands, that ye are so perlite, Miss Brown? What's become of yer school?"</p> 
               <p>"It is half-holiday, so I came to receive you and Jessie. I am not experiencing much gratitude, I must say, from Miss Peggy Wyat."</p> 
               <p>Peggy's face had been gradually relaxing; now she pushed Polly aside with a laugh, and as James' voice at that instant summoned her above, she bade her "go and help Jim Lee. Ye know I allers telled ye, ye had better set up housekeeping together."</p> 
               <p>With crimson cheeks, Polly turned in silence, and ran up stairs; I followed</p> 
               <p>Could order ever be evoked from that chaos of furniture, carpets and crockery?</p> 
               <p>Dwight grew merry over my blank visage, declaring that I reminded him of Marius amidst the ruins of Carthage.</p> 
               <p>As Polly had said, some rooms were made habitable for the night, but it required weeks to get everything arranged, and longer to feel at home. Accustomed to the spacious, country mansions, everything was so close, so confined! Peggy declared it seemed like a big baby-house. "She felt as if she was playing keep house, and scarcely dared turn for fear of knocking herself. And that little brick-floored yard, no bigger than a pocket handkerchief; and mounting the ruff of a shed to dry clothes! Well, the wisest man mistook when he said there was nothing new under the sun. He had n't seen Boston notions!"</p> 
               <p>The difficulties of limited space were increased by the ceaseless influx of visitors. My own relatives and friends I expected and desired, but had not counted upon entertaining "dear friends," whom I could scarcely recognize, and fortieth cousins of whom I had barely heard,-people who, wishing to see the city, found it convenient to do so at our trouble and expense.</p> 
               <p>One after another they came from town and country, by stage, chaise and wagon; with all sized, shaped, and colored trunks, till Dwight threatened a hermitage, and our next neighbor, to Peggy's disgust, inquired if Mrs. Sprague took boarders.</p> 
               <p>Among the first visitors, were Mr. and Mrs. Jonas Prime. Ann looked still handsome in her rich bridal robes, but there was a cold glitter in the eye, a strained, contracted look to the skin, and a peevish, fretful expression, that thus early in life spoke of past loveliness, and foreboded an uncomfortable future.</p> 
               <p>The following summer proved that this estimate was too true. During a stay at the parsonage, I saw enough that was dissatisfactory throughput the family, every member of which came to me with their troubles.</p> 
               <p>Ann, sulky and indolent, passed her time in selfish indulgence, miserable herself and a source of misery to every one with whom she associated.</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Norton complained of her daughter's lack of sympathy. "Jonas was harder than Parson Kirkwood, and Ann didn't seem to care what became of her father and mother if she could only dress and live at ease. After all<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6399-00000117"/> they had spent to bring her up, it was a shame, and poor William, in his grave, it was not what she expected from Ann."</p> 
               <p>Under the pretext of showing her cheese, Mrs. Prime drew me aside for a confidential chat. "What could they do with Ann? She and Sir had tried to put her in Debby's place; they had tried to give her a darter's welcome; why did she thus scorn 'em? Why did she marry Jonas if she could not mix with his family, look upon them as her equals?"</p> 
               <p>I did not say, as I might, for the lucre that you and Mr. Prime have slaved so to obtain, but speaking the consolation that was possible, I turned away glad to dispel these domestic shadows in the sunny homes of other friends.</p> 
               <p>The parish was still greatly exercised respecting the new meeting-house, a new structure had become absolutely necessary, as the old one was in a most dilapidated condition. Snow and rain made their way through the roof in such quantities, that in a smart shower during service, people were fain to raise their umbrellas, and perch their feet upon seats and stools while the water ran in rivulets over the floor.</p> 
               <p>Added to this, owing to Parson Kirk-wood's resignation, were dissensions regarding rival candidates for the pastorate. The new minister was finally chosen, but the dispute referring to the site of the church at length became so hopeless of settlement, that it was decided to submit the matter to three unprejudiced persons, from as many of the adjacent towns.</p> 
               <p>This committee very properly concluded that it should stand on a fine, imposing spot near the foot of the hill, and work was immediately commenced, much to Deacon Osborn's and Aunt Judy's disquiet. "They would have to go over the hill. 'Twas a sin and a shame to make some folks travel while others would save shoe leather!" Aunt Judy and her sisters felt called upon for such a round of parish visiting to descant upon the theme, that Ruthy declared, "They would get stout, living so much on company victuals."</p> 
               <p>Dwight came to the raising of the new meeting-house; one of those prim edifices, with tapering spire and gilded weathercock, which have been such prominent objects in a New England landscape. And though these now are passing into oblivion, one cannot always admire the more pretentious buildings that usurp their place. A neat New England church is an object for respect, but one cannot entertain great veneration for a painted, pine cathedral.</p> 
               <p>The following Sabbath could be but a serious, thoughtful day to Dwight and myself. Ere the return of another season, that old structure would be level with the dust; henceforth, that high, carved, oaken chair must be the sole memento of the sanctuary of the fathers.</p> 
               <p>As day melted into night, my husband drew me forth. Silently we sauntered up the grassy road. The crescent moon fell in checkered light through the tall elms, but the square meeting-house stood in bold relief on the bare hilltop. Leaning against the old horse-block, we gazed over the peaceful stretch of quiet landscape, reposing beneath the soft moon and twinkling stars. Suddenly Dwight turned to the sombre pile, and lifting the ponderous latch, motioned me to enter. All the old dread at these nocturnal visits clutched my limbs; not a step could I have moved. Dwight smiled; "I will not force you against your inclination, but I must go in for a moment, Jessie. I have been here so many times alone with my grief, that I would like to have my wife's company in my joy."</p> 
               <p>He should have it! Hallowed was the hour, that last hour in that consecrated house, hallowed by past memo ries and future hopes and aspirations; an hour which gave both grace and strength for the new and brilliant career, even then, though unperceived, looming in the distance.</p>

               <p>MIRA'S summer vacation had been spent with her new friend in Maryland. A description of the tour awaited my return.</p> 
               <p>"Dear Jessie," she wrote: "what an age it appears since I last seated myself to talk to you. I must go back to examination day, which now seems in the far past. The dreaded epoch passed better than I had dared hope. Teacher and pupils received many encomiums.</p> 
               <p>"Mrs. Morton called early the following morning, as it is a long day's ride to 'Riverside.' Our route lay first through a level, sandy country, dotted with old-fashioned country houses, and green with waving crops; then came heavy timber, woods so dense that the thoughts reverted to the forest primeval. Soon after noon, the darkening sky and muttering thunder announced an approaching tempest. Lafayette whipped up his horses, with the assurance that we could reach Maum Sally's tavern before the storm. The sky grew momentarily blacker, the thunder rolled, and the wind wailed through the trees; but just as the first big drops fell, we espied a long, low, log hut in a little clearing by the roadside. Maum Sally, a prim negress, in a blue gown and red turban, received us with many courtesies, and congratulations that we had reached her roof, 'Tank God.' With many apologies and compliments we were led through a kitchen, into an inner room, rude and simple, but clean.</p> 
               <p>"Summoning a girl to wait upon the ladies, the landlady hurried out to give directions respecting our horses, and to prepare some refreshment for ourselves. The whole fury of the storm now burst upon us. One that has never witnessed a Southern thunder-shower can have little conception of its violence. The clear, sultry day suddenly becomes overcast; lightning flashes and thunder rolls; rain, mingled with hail, pours like a second flood, while the wind rises to a perfect tornado. One of the most terrific of these fearful tempests now rolled over us. In that low, dark hut, amid the wide, sombre forest, it was sufficient to try one's nerves. My terror was heightened in the midst of the shower, by the entrance of a half-dozen negro men, dripping and noisy.</p> 
               <p>"Mrs. Morton laughed at my disquietude; bidding me see how quiet they grew as soon as Maum Sally had informed them of the occupants of the inner room. As is common, the shower passed as quickly as it had risen, and nature-that a few moments previous had seemed resolving itself into chaos-came forth, smiling, as an infant from its bath. Maum Sally's nice tea and hot cake having been duly honored, the carriage was brought, and we bowed our adieus to the grinning darkies, who with many genuflections, wished us 'a right smart ride.'</p> 
               <p>"It was late when we arrived at Riverside, but the twilight revealed a large square house, with a veranda surrounding three sides. Beyond the broad, shady carriage drive, a smooth lawn stretched to the Patuxant, across whose blue waters rose the dark, wooded slopes Of Calvert county. To the left, lay a garden, dim and fragrant; in the rear, rose the kitchen, stable, etc.; farther on, at the end of a green lane, came the negro quarters; wandering forward, the eye took in a vast expanse<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6399-00000118"/> of grain and tobacco fields, bounded by a dark fringe of forest.</p> 
               <p>"A bevy of blacks, their faces radiant at the return of 'Missus' and especially of 'little Missy,' greeted us as we ascended the low, broad steps of the piazza. Little Mary was borne forward in triumph, while her mother and I followed into a wide apartment, half hall, half sitting-room, extending through the depth of the house. Opening from this are the parlor, dining-room, library and Mrs. Morton's bedroom, while an exquisitely carved oaken staircase leads to the story above.</p> 
               <p>"My hostess conducted me to a large, pleasant chamber, and having removed the dust of our journey, the summons came for tea. The social meal over, Mrs. Morton returned to the hall. Seating herself at a small table, upon which were lights and a Bible and prayer-book, she placed me by her side, while her little girl sank upon the ottoman at her feet. There was an instant's pause, then, through the open door at the farther end, defiled a long line of blacks, each bearing a wooden stool The house servants, and several from the quarters, came to join with their mistress at evening prayers. With military order, the stools were ranged and the throng seated. Then, with reverent faces, they listened to the sweet-voiced reader, joining in the responses and hymns. I never witnessed anything more impressive than this patriarchal scene. The service ended each with a good-night bow or courtesy, retired.</p> 
               <p>"The morning revealed a most lovely prospect. I was watching the graceful swans as they floated up and down the glassy stream, when Mary summoned me to visit her Guinea hens and peacocks. Cloe, the housemaid, was polishing the hard pine floor of the hall as we descended. I was compelled to stop and admire its delicate and beautiful shading, reminding me of the ball at the parsonage.</p> 
               <p>"Mrs. Morton joined us in the yard, and after looking at Mary's pets, she led the way to the spring-house, a shady, stone building, on the edge of a clear stream. Opening the door, we found ourselves in a clean, cool dairy. Peggy's heart would have been rejoiced at that row of golden-crowned pans.</p> 
               <p>"Mrs. Morton having superintended the skimming of the cream, and given the dairy-maid her instructions, we returned to the house for breakfast. The meal was scarcely over, when a sweaty, black Hercules appeared with a horrid cut in his foot from a hoe. I suppose I could have dressed the wound, but am sure that I could never have summoned the equanimity with which Mrs. Morton performed that office.</p> 
               <p>"Miss Mary's things, and Mrs. Morton's muslins, having been handed to the laundress, the seamstress-who had commenced the new clothes to be given to the servants at Christmas-next came under supervision. Aunt Milly having received audience amidst a great jingling of keys; and Thomas Jefferson set to work weeding the garden beds,-my hostess invited me to accompany her to the quarters.</p> 
               <p>"Passing the spring-house, we entered a green lane lined by white-washed huts, each surrounded by a little garden plot, with a piggery and poultry coops. The hands were in the fields; only the aged slaves and children remained at the village. It was pleasant to see the cordiality and affection evinced by both mistress and servants as we walked forward. Mrs. Morton had a kind word for each, inquired for one's rheumatism, prescribed for that one's cough, gave another a large print testament,-several of her slaves can read,-and a fourth, a little snuff, while a fifth had a new pipe; and a sixth, a flaming red and yellow flowered cot ton handkerchief. The children who had flocked round Mary, were regaled, much to their delight, with molasses cakes.</p> 
               <p>"We were upon the point of returning, after the purchase of some eggs and a pair of chickens, when an aged crone hobbled up to Mrs. Morton and whispered in her ear.</p> 
               <p>"With the exclamation 'Is it possible?' she hastily turned towards one of the cottages, motioning me to follow. We entered a low, untidy apartment; before a few smouldering embers crouched a negress, while upon the bed in one corner lay a heap, which Mrs. Morton instantly lifted; a sharp cry announced its humanity; but certainly I never saw a more miserable or disgusting object. The indolent mother had been too lazy to properly wash or dress her infant during the absence of her mistress.</p> 
               <p>"Despatching Mary for sponge, soap and powder, Mrs. Morton commenced disrobing the little sooty innocent, administering a sharp rebuke to the negligent mother meanwhile. Little Africa having been duly bathed and dressed, we hastened to the house, as notice had come of the 'arrival of visitors. We found Col. Morton, a brother of our hostess' late, husband, his wife, two daughters and niece. Mr. Conway, the clergyman of the parish, who is an inmate of Mrs. Morton's household, returned from a three days' parochial-tour before noon, and at dinner the party was enlarged by the entrance of three gentlemen on their way to Port Tobacco.</p> 
               <p>"The afternoon was spent in visiting the dowager, Madam Morton, who resides in an ante-revolutionary mansion, a quarter of a mile below, just upon the river bank.</p> 
               <p>"The house, with its spacious rooms, narrow passages, dark closets and many sized and shaped windows, reminded me of our old-fashioned New England abodes. The rich, antique furniture heightened this impression, and the striped home-made carpets,-now on account of the heat,-rolled up beneath the slender-legged, mahogany card tables, looked so natural that I almost fancied myself at South-end.</p> 
               <p>"Madam Morton, a stately lady of ninety years, welcomed us with affectionate urbanity; I, a stranger, receiving marked attention.</p> 
               <p>"This old lady, strange to relate, has recently been restored to active life, after having been bedridden from a paralytic affection for more than ten years.</p> 
               <p>"At the advent of the British, last summer, the Riverside plantations were subjected to a most devastating raid.' Much mischief in the shape of mutilated fruit trees, trampled gardens, overturned out-houses, etc., marked their sojourn. Many purely malicious acts were perpetrated, such as casting the entrails of the poultry and pigs they had slaughtered into the well, with various other vandalisms. Mrs. Morton and Mary escaped to Col. Morton's, some dozen miles inland; the darkies took to the woods, and poor old madam, who had resolutely refused to move was left alone, with her faithful attendant; but as the boats advanced up the river, the frightened creature betook herself to a dark closet at the back of the house, leaving her helpless mistress alone in a room facing the river. Like many Southern country houses, a door opened from this apartment on the lawn which, at a few paces, was bounded by the stream. As the boats drew near, one of the soldiers, in mere thoughtlessness, it is charitable to presume, raised his gun, aiming for the broad centre panel, and fired. The bullet passed through the stout oak, whizzed directly over the<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6399-00000119"/> head of the palsied woman, and lodged in the wall beyond.</p> 
               <p>"The bed had stood in such a position that Madam Morton had seen the boat advance, and the raising of the gun, but such was the shock, that as the bullet whistled past she sprang from her bed and ran into the next room with all the agility of youth. The use of her limbs was entirely restored, and now she is remarkably active for one of her years. 'No thanks to the miscreants,' she added, after relating the adventure, as she pointed out the round hole in the door, and the bullet, which is still safely ensconced in the wainscot. 'A great, enlightened nation, to permit its soldiers to shoot palsied old gentlewomen in their beds! I sincerely trust that my own countrymen will never again be so dastardly as to permit it.'</p> 
               <p>"After nightfall, the party was increased by the entrance of half-a-dozen neighboring young men, that is, residents within twelve or fifteen miles, who, finding themselves belated upon a hunting excursion, came to claim the hospitality of Riverside. Surely, no hospitality equals that of the South! It is so easy, so genial, wholly devoid of that fuss and parade, which often has made me feel so inopportune and uncomfortable at the North. Though Aunt Milly must have been compelled to bake an additional plate of waffles, and fry a superabundance of rashers, her ebony face retained all of its jocund self-satisfaction, while her mistress gave directions with a placidity that, if ever I am a housekeeper, I hope to emulate.</p> 
               <p>"Of one thing I have become profoundly convinced, Jessie, and that is, that New England, good and excellent as she is, does not possess the sum total of human virtue, and that there is nothing like travel to educate one's ideas.</p> 
               <p>"The evening was a most lively one, but through its whole length my brain kept upon the rack respecting the sleeping quarters for these new guests. All the bed chambers, as I knew, had become previously filled. What was to be done with these six young men?</p> 
               <p>"As Miss Selby-who had been assigned for my roommate-and I were crossing the hall on our way up stairs, what should I espy, but six camp beds nicely stretched in the dining room, while Cloe was unrolling the mattresses that Thomas Jefferson brought in, and, at the same moment, Aunt Milly appeared, followed by Rosa, bearing a pile of sheets and counterpanes.</p> 
               <p>"I asked if the hunters were to be put there?</p> 
               <p>"'Yes Miss,' replied Aunt Milly. 'We keep these yere a purpose in de little hut by de kitchen; I shall rous de gen-lemen yerly, dey can wash on de piazza, so de room will be to rights for breffust.'</p> 
               <p>"I nodded my approbation, and told my companion as we went above, 'That I began to understand the capabilities of a southern domicile.'</p> 
               <p>"'I scarcely think you do wholly, our resources are sometimes wonderful. We shall be obliged to stow closer here to-morrow night. My two younger sisters are coming. Have you any objections to their occupying a straw bed upon the floor?'</p> 
               <p>"'No indeed, the more the merrier.'</p> 
               <p>"'Thank you. But, Miss Rutledge, how unlike you are to all my preconceived notions of a Yankee lady, a schoolma'am at least.'</p> 
               <p>"'What was your notion?'</p> 
               <p>"'Well, something like Mr. Stuart; he says he cannot believe you what is represented. He had imagined every Yankee lady as thin, picked nosed, green-spectacled, and exceedingly blue, prudish, solemn and puritanical.'</p> 
                
               <p>"'How satisfactory it is to become a means of increasing the knowledge of mankind!'</p> 
               <p>"Miss Selby laughed. 'If it is a satisfaction to win hearts also, I think you in a fair way to achieve your goal Mr. Stuart is evidently smitten; he pronounces you divine, angelic.'</p> 
               <p>"'Somewhat avoirdupois for a spirit, but I like the dark-whiskered gentleman best.'</p> 
               <p>"'You do! But he is not so good a match.'</p> 
               <p>"'Why not?'</p> 
               <p>"'Mr. Stuart owns a plantation; Mr. Eldredge is only endowed with education, talent and industry.'</p> 
               <p>"'I should pronounce him decidedly the best match.'</p> 
               <p>"Miss Selby's face kindled. 'You should?-that is a Yankee idea.'</p> 
               <p>"'Perhaps so. But how comes it that the young man is dependent upon himself? I thought the Eldredges were a very wealthy family.'</p> 
               <p>"'They are; but Mr. Sam (this Mr. Sam's father) was exceedingly dissipated. He died early, leaving a young widow and this one son, then an infant. Most of his property waist gone; the widow retained a house and a few acres of land in Georgetown. Owing to the exertions of a faithful and attached woman servant, this land became a means of support Elsie could be seen in her garden at all hours, and her vegetables, fruit, and flowers always commanded the highest prices. These, with the milk of the two cows, that obtained most of their living upon the commons, kept the family above want, and brought Mr. Sam to man's estate. His father's brothers supplied the means for his education; but they never liked his mother; and she, a weak, delicate person, might have starved without Elsie.'</p> 
               <p>"'Noble creature! I hope Mr. Eldredge has given her her freedom.'</p> 
               <p>"'Yankee again! Yes, Mr. Eldredge has done so; but what does it signify? Of course, he will always take care of her.'</p> 
               <p>"'That is to be hoped; but he might have died; then she, a bondwoman, could have been resold.'</p> 
               <p>"'Yes; I have experienced the trouble to which such a case subjects one. I was talking with Mr. Eldredge this evening about manumitting my mother's old waiting-woman. When the estate was settled, she was obliged to go to Port Tobacco with the rest of the niggers. I bid her in, or Frank (my Brother) did for me; but she came home in a terribly indignant state. We did the best we could to save her feelings. Frank took her with him in his gig. But she says it was just like a sale of horses; that they looked at her teeth, felt of her arms, and poked her ribs, till Mr. Frank stopped them. Of course, as she has been delicately brought up, always been a maid to a lady, she feels differently from some; besides, she is partly white, and to please her, I mean to give her her freedom; though I know I shall always have to take care of her, for she is no more fit to go out into the world and earn her living than a baby.'</p> 
               <p>"'Still, I think you will never be sorry that she is free.'</p> 
               <p>"'No; I do not expect to be, and Mr. Eldredge approves of the course.'</p> 
               <p>"'Which makes it doubly expedient in your eyes. I think I must put up with the Stuart plantation.'</p> 
               <p>"'I wish Stuart heard that speech. Hark, what is that? Oh, I know,' was added, as the young lady stretched over the piazza-railing: 'It is Aunt Morton just coming in. I heard her tell the overseer that she would go to read and pray with Uncle Sambo, who is dying, Mr. Conway has been with him all the evening, but he must see the missus; her prayers would carry<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6399-00000120"/> him straight to "de bressed land," and I think they will.'</p> 
               <p>"'I find that my ideas of Southern ladies were as erroneous as yours of Northerners. I entertained an impression that they were a vain, frivolous race; too indolent for useful exertion. If Mrs. Morton is a representative of their class, I cannot envy the planter's wives.'</p> 
               <p>"'Aunt Nellie is a rara-avis; still, upon the whole, our ladies are far from being an idle people. Aunt Nellie has changed greatly since that dream or vision the night after her former lover's death.'</p> 
               <p>"'Dream or vision! Do you allude to Mr. Raymond?'</p> 
               <p>"'Yes. Has she never told you that she saw him the night after he was drowned?'</p> 
               <p>"'No indeed! Saw Mr. Raymond?'</p> 
               <p>"'Yes; she says he came at midnight, and bade her to cease repining, to live an active, useful life, till the Lord saw fit to unite them above. Whether this was imagination or reality, it worked an almost supernatural change in my aunt; and by her influence, throughout the family and plantation. Uncle John had become sadly dissipated. Whilst grandma kept about, her influence was a restraint; but when she became bedridden, he grew wholly unlicensed. Aunt Nellie, despairing and melancholy, sank into morbid supineness. Uncle John partially lost the use of his limbs; the overseer took undue advantage, and the servants were lazy and unruly. From the date of this phantom visit, began a new era. Cheerful, active, resolute, Aunt Nellie began her present life, with the additional care of a querulous invalid, sick in body and sick in mind; but she had the satisfaction of reclaiming the estate, and of bringing her husband to a state of penitence and, we humbly trust, of regeneration. It matters little whether this was a dream or reality, its spirituality is attested by its effects; but I solemnly believe she saw Mr. Raymond, as she asserts. Do not you think such things possible?'</p> 
               <p>"'My Cousin Jessie would say "yes"; for myself, I am undecided.'</p> 
               <p>"'Your Cousin Jessie? She was <emph>the one!</emph> I have read some of her letters. Is she as lovely as yourself?'</p> 
               <p>"I hope you will appreciate the fine things I told of you, Madam Wisdom, as we retired to rest.</p> 
               <p>"Mr. Stuart and Mr. Eldredge, having accepted Mrs. Morton's invitation to remain over Sunday, the morning was passed pleasantly on horseback. At noon, we were joined by the two younger Misses Selby, lively girls of sixteen and eighteen. A gay chat was going on over the dessert, when an unusual hubbub arose on the lawn, followed by a rush of servants with dilated eyes, who affrightedly proclaimed that 'Ole Missus was poisoned. Rosy had boiled a scorpian in de cabbage!'</p> 
               <p>"Springing from table, we ran to the other house. Simple medicines are at hand on a plantation. Madam Morton had already swallowed an emetic; this soon freed her from danger, though the old lady was much shattered and exhausted.</p> 
               <p>"Inquiries and explanations followed. A few days previous, Madam Morton had injudiciously informed her maid, Rosy, that at her decease, she would receive her freedom and six hundred dollars. Not waiting for the course of nature, Miss Rosy concluded to take the matter in her own hands; but when the effects of her work began to be manifest, contritely confessing her guilt, she flew to the woods, half-crazed with terror.</p> 
               <p>"Men and dogs soon hunted her out, and, amid the wildest clamor, the miserable creature was borne back to the house, and ushered, bedraggled and torn, into her mistress' presence.</p> 
               <p>"Crouching down before the pale, trembling old lady, with upraised hands and eyes, she began to 'bress de Lord, her ole missus had been spared.' One could but sympathize with, and believe in, the sincerity of the girl's penitence.</p> 
               <p>"For a moment, Madam Morton gazed in tearful silence into the sable face; then, in tremulous tones, demanded, how she could have committed such a sin?</p> 
               <p>"'Oh, Rosy, after all my teaching, how could you forget the holy commandment, "Thou shalt not kill."'</p> 
               <p>"'Cos Satan tempt me; he come jes' here fore me, an' he say, six hunner dollars, Rosy, six hunner dollars, an' yer time for yerself. I'se sold myself to Satan, Missus.'</p> 
               <p>"'Then pray to Jesus for a ransom. I will pray for you, Rosy. Now go and clean yourself; you must go into the field after this. Becky must take your place. This is a great trial to me, for I am used to you, Rosy, and Becky is a young thing.'</p> 
               <p>"'Yes, Missus; 'tis a sad ting. But don't forgit to ask de bressed Lord not to give poor Rosy over to Satan entirely,' and. with a most downcast, deprecatory air, the girl took herself away.</p> 
               <p>"Col. Morton declared the jade more cunning than contrite; she should be tied up and whipped, while the ladies were unanimous in the opinion that such a dangerous character ought to be sold down to Georgia immediately.</p> 
               <p>"The dowager silenced the outcry. She had decreed Rosy's punishment; it would be sufficient. She had known the girl from birth; as she had said, she was tempted beyond her strength, her contrition was sincere. It was thoughtless in her to have chattered about her intentions; she felt that she ought not to have put a stumbling block in a weaker brother's way.</p> 
               <p>"Silenced, if not convinced, the party bade their relative good evening. Mrs. Col. Morton thought that Rosy would soon regain her old situation. 'Grandma would never get on with Becky,' and Mrs. Nellie Morton coincided in this opinion. I could not but hope their predictions would be realized, for wicked as she had been, I felt that the girl would never again yield to Satan. Mrs. Morton was expecting a guest from the West; we sat upon the piazza till a late hour, awaiting his arrival, but as he did not appear, we betook ourselves to our sleeping apartments.</p> 
               <p>"The gentlemen had been accommodated in the next room with an extra bed for the anticipated arrival. The night, sultry and hot, brought a disinclination for sleep. We were in the midst of a whispered colloquy, when our ears were greeted with strange creakings and gruntings from the next room</p> 
               <p>"'It is Sam Eldredge tuning Uncle John's old violin. I saw it on the top of the wardrobe this morning,' said Louisa Selby, as she sat up to listen.</p> 
               <p>"'True, in a moment, we were favored with, 'Charley over the Water,' which was succeeeed by Henry's Cottage Maid,' the latter being accompanied by the two young ladies on the straw pallet, in an exceedingly humorous if not exactly harmonious concert.</p> 
               <p>"The partition wall was not thick. The duet, 'Shepherds, have you seen my Flora pass this Way,' was quite creditably performed; next came the old Revolutionary song.</p> 
               <p>"'Why should vain mortals tremble at the sight of Death and destruction on the field of battle,' but as it was Saturday night, Miss Louisa opined that sacred music was proper. Shouting to Mr. Eldredge to play psalm tunes, 'Greenfield' was struck up.</p> 
               <pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6399-00000121"/> 
               <p>"The musicians had all been educated at the North. Mr. Eldredge at the Harvard, the Misses Selby, in Connecticut; they were well acquainted with 'Fugueing,' but the way the tenor led, and the treble started after, the rush with which the basso tumbled in, the pirouetting on the top lines of the cleff, and the trilling and quavering, would have even astonished the scientific choir at the 'Old South,' in our goodly town, and certainly cast them quite into the shade.</p> 
               <p>"The whole music and surroundings were so excessively ludicrous that free vent was given to our merriment; the fun and frolic were at their height, when the tall clock in the hall struck twelve.</p> 
               <p>"'There it is, Sunday; we must go to sleep,' exclaimed Miss Louisa, where-upon a good night was chanted and returned.</p> 
               <p>"For a second, complete silence settled over the house; the next, a clear, manly voice commenced the beautiful vesper hymn to the Virgin.</p> 
               <p>"Simultaneously, we sprang up, and listened. That was neither Mr. Stuart nor Sam Eldredge; it must be the stranger; he must have arrived, and come above unheard amid the musical hubbub.</p> 
               <p>"Whilst my companions were unravelling the mystery, across my vision glided an old church, with a rosy-cheeked boy, peeping between the balusters of the square pew; next I stood by him, now tall and stalwart, and sang those words, in the parlor of our French countess.</p> 
               <p>"As the last sweet strain died on the night air, I sank beside my companion, whispering, 'Who is this new guest?'</p> 
               <p>"'A Mr. Carnes,-Thomas Carnes from Ohio; he is a distant relative of Aunt Nellie's, and a very superior and rising young man, a prospective member of Congress, also quite a match; prepare to look your prettiest. Bon soir.'</p> 
               <p>"Thomas Carnes from Ohio! A very superior and rising young man! Do you wonder that Morpheus fled my couch till near morning?</p> 
               <p>"Shall I confess that I actually dreaded to descend to breakfast; but my nervousness was superfluous. Mr. Carnes of Ohio, met me with deferential politeness, and interested inquiries for old friends. My hostess and her guests were agreeably surprised to find that we were old acquaintances.</p> 
               <p>"As the church was five miles distant, preparations were early made for the ride thither. The narrow road wound through dense woods, intersected here and there by bridle-paths, with now and then a log hut by the wayside. Suddenly, we drove into a small opening, in the midst of which uprose a plain, unpainted edifice.</p> 
               <p>"Our cavalcade stopped, the horses were tied to the trees, and entering the unpretending church, we advanced to a square pew near the chancel.</p> 
               <p>"Scattered in the adjacent pews were the country families, while beyond, were those occupied by the overseers, and seats still farther back accommodated the still humbler class of whites; the galleries were crowded with negroes, whose solemn visages and Sunday garb were most imposing, presenting a curious and unique spectacle to a New England eye.</p> 
               <p>"'The Lord is in his holy temple, let all the earth keep silence before Him.'</p> 
               <p>"Never had the truth and majesty of those words struck me so forcibly as at that moment, when, rising, I took the side of the large prayer-book which Mr. Carnes presented to share with me. Truly, He was in His Temple; what could we do but silently bow to His decrees?</p> 
                
               <p>"As the evening service was held in another and still more distant parish, the afternooon was spent at home.</p> 
               <p>"The children of the plantation gathered on the piazza to repeat the creed and commandments to their mistress. Their shiny, black faces, rolling eyes, and white teeth, as they stood in clean, Sunday blue frocks and butternut suits, were far from an unpleasant sight.</p> 
               <p>"The recitation was nearly over, when Col. Morton, who had been dozing in his easy chair, suddenly opened his eyes. Gazing wildly about, he seized his cane, and in a stentorian voice, demanded 'What it meant? What all these niggers were doing?' His wife soothingly explained.</p> 
               <p>"'Oh, some of Sister Nellie's hobbies,' he returned, calming down, 'Well, well, I dare say she is right! No doubt the children ought to be religiously taught; but I was half asleep, and I thought it was a rising.'</p> 
               <p>"Much surprised, I asked Mr. Eldredge what could have suggested such an idea. He explained, that when Col. Morton was a child he had witnessed a terrible negro insurrection. 'I think that since, he has felt like one who resides upon a volcano, which, though quiet, is liable to, burst forth at any moment.'</p> 
               <p>"'But surely there can be no danger?'</p> 
               <p>"'Not if the blacks are left to themselves. Besides, the "Missus," with reason, is here considered little less than an angel.'</p> 
               <p>"Uncle Sambo, the slave who had died the night previous, was to be interred after tea. As Mr. Conway had a long, ride, the sun was low in the horizon when we reached the negro burying-ground. The blacks were bearing the body from the quarters in mournful procession, accompanying their steps by a plaintive, wailing chant. The clergyman advanced to meet the bier, and the burial service was read beside the open grave, just on the edge of the sombre wood, growing dusky, with lengthening shadows.</p> 
               <p>"This over, a tall, athletic negro, with a well-developed head and somewhat imposing physique, habited in a professional black coat, a second-hand, from 'massa,' advanced to the head of the coffin. This was Uncle Julius, a famous preacher from a neighboring plantation, come to pay the last honor to his 'brudder in Christ' by a funeral sermon. First, a hymn was sung in a minor key, with much pathos. This was followed by a prayer, in which his hearers were exhorted to 'get'pentenee 'fore de summonger called; de grim summonger, def, dat now stood right dere, right in de bery midst.' Then came the, 'text.' 'And dem dat had gotten de vic'try ober de beast and ober his image and ober his mark and ober de number ob his name, stand on de sea of glass, habing de harps of God.'</p> 
               <p>"Intellectually, the sermon was nothing, in its strange jumble of ideas, and wrong adaptation of words and metaphors; analytically, it was simply ridiculous; yet such was the sympathetic power of the hour and the preacher, that at the time, one could not think of criticism, or dream of mirth.</p> 
               <p>"As the blacks expressed it: 'Uncle Julius made us all feel good.' One could but be touched with his description of 'dat bressed Lamb dat died for sinners. De bressed, precious Lord Jesus, who sweat de big drops of blood, and wore de thorny crown upon dat bressed brow, and hung upon de cross to raise us up from dis 'terminated erf.' Then came triumphal visions of 'de hebbenly city, de pearly gates ob shining gold, de crystal robes made white in de ribber flowing from de jasper throne, wid de tree of life for de healing<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6399-00000122"/> ing ob de nations. Vic'try, salbation and power to de Lord, who take us out ob de big pit, and gib us de vic'try ober def an' hell.'</p> 
               <p>"The services were closed by another hymn. After the benediction, his simple audience crowded round the preacher, tearfully clasping his hand, with fervent thanks and blessings.</p> 
               <p>"The coffin having been lowered into the grave, the gentlefolks turned homewards. The moon had risen over the trees, the river gleamed in the distance; not a sound disturbed the lovely summer night. Mr. Carnes drew my arm within his, and we fell behind the others. There was a pause; then he began to speak of the past. Surprised, awestruck, I listened. Was this possible? Jessie, I have often been obliged to own your superiority; but this never came with such force as at that hour. Dear cousin, receive my thanks, my homage, that, rising above conventionalities, you dared to follow in the steps of your Lord; that through the few kind words you dared to speak, we can, with the angels, rejoice that one soul has been awakened to the beauty of true holiness.</p> 
               <p>"Another ring encircles that finger now; but yours shall, as it ought, ever retain the first place.</p> 
               <p>"The harvest festival was approaching. Monday commenced the bustle of preparation. Sheep and pigs were slaughtered, pyramids of 'hoe-cake' baked, and other edibles provided.</p> 
               <p>"Long tables having been set upon the lawn, and the servants' finery generally reburnished, the young ladies proceeded to array Mrs. Morton's dressing maid, Jenny. Her bright sprigged muslin was ornamented with ribbons; a white tucker (my contribution) fell gracefully over her ebony bosom, and her head grew radiant with roses. Miss Louisa, wishing a further supply, called to Thomas Jefferson, whom we had heard whistling in Mr. Conway's room, to fetch them. The lad appeared, bearing with him a strong odor of opodeldoc.</p> 
               <p>"'Now, Tom Jef, what have you been doing? You have been meddling with the medicine Mr. Con way uses for his sprain,' said the young lady.</p> 
               <p>"Tom Jef gave a queer, startled leer, but stoutly averred: "Dat he nebber touched it! 'Deed an' 'deed, an' double 'deed, Miss Louise, I'se nebber did!'</p> 
               <p>"Miss Louisa turned, and passing her hand over his wool, fairly wrung the ointment from his locks.</p> 
               <p>"'Oh, Tom Jef, what a liar! I expect that you will fall down dead, like Ananias and Sapphira!'</p> 
               <p>"'Laws, no, you don't. I'se not Bible folks, I tought dat was de sweet stinkum Mars Sam put on he head. Is't de stuff for Mars Conway's foot? Oh laws, what a go! 'Dildoc on my head! Oh laws! he, he, he! ha, ha, ha!! ho, ho, ho!!!'</p> 
               <p>"It was impossible to refrain from joining in this outburst of merriment; as impossible to scold the little, bright, saucy scamp, one of the veriest imps of creation.</p> 
               <p>"Jenny's toilet was scarcely complete, ere we were summoned to the upper piazza by shouts of uproarious glee. Coming towards the house was a motley procession, consisting of all the plantation hands, bearing Col. Morton at their head. The stout gentleman was carried triumphantly forward upon the arms of two stalwart laborers, just as we used to carry 'arm-chair,' when children. Having deployed before the house, 'Massa' was set down, when, after a neat speech, he invited them to the hall, where they were treated to whiskey.</p> 
               <p>"Having drunk Massa's and Missus' health, the crowd adjourned to don their Sunday suits and holiday finery.</p> 
               <p>"At five, they again assembled on the lawn; grace having been said, the harvest supper was served. Then commenced such courtesy as is seldom witnessed. Such bobbing and courtesying, such complimenting and gallanting, such coying and simpering, and aping of 'de white gentlefolks,' as would have made a cynic laugh.</p> 
               <p>"The repast finished, dancing began; but as night shut in, the Terpsichorean band adjourned to the long, low kitchen. Fresh logs were thrown upon the smouldering embers in the huge stone fireplace, and the pirouetting, shuffling, double shuffling, stamping and leaping, grew furious. Fitful gleams and ruddy flashes toyed with the smoke-embrowned rafters and beams of the dusky room, glittered in the well scoured utensils on the dresser, and lighted the black, shiny faces of the sable throng. Truly, it was a picture to rejoice a Rembrandt; how I wished that Dwight could have sketched it!</p> 
               <p>"Miss Jenny, thanks to our care, had become the belle, par excellence, and the dance went on to an improvised strain in her honor. It ran something in this wise: <q>

               </p> 
               <p>"The dancing was permitted till ten o'clock, when the company dispersed, after having again drank healths round.</p> 
               <p>"The following week, Mr. Carnes escorted me home. I had the honor to receive Mr. Stuart's regrets at my departure. To his inquiry, 'if there were more such Yankee schoolma'ams,' I assured him of plenty, hundreds in general and Miss Kate Donaldson in particular.</p> 
               <p>"The little woman has consented to take my school, to which I cannot return; having engaged to become private tutor to one big pupil this winter. I feel that my patrons are fortunate in my successor. Miss Kate cannot fail to please, and she will find the society especially congenial. I wish I was as certain of my qualifications for my new task; but I shall take my Cousin Jessie for a model, and if somebody does not behave, I shall just uphold Dwight as the pattern for a model husband."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXIX.</head> 
               <head type="sub">JOY AND GRIEF.</head> 
               <p>SO the childish love, which had lived through evil and good, was to receive fruition! This was more than any had dared to hope, and, with fervent congratulations, God was thanked for the happiness vouchsafed to our beloved cousin and dear friend. The autumn continued the subjects for gratitude. A speculation, which Mr. Sprague had given over as hopeless, took an unlooked-for aspect, and in a few weeks much of that fortune which had been deemed irretrievably lost was wholly restored.</p> 
               <p>Previous to his business distress, Mr. Sprague had arranged to build a new house in Summer street. As soon as his good luck was assured, much to Madam Sprague's delight, the old house<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6399-00000123"/> was demolished, and preparations began for the new mansion. Mrs. Mason, now their only child, had been some months in Europe for the benefit of her health, but it was intended, that she should return to occupy the new structure upon its completion.</p> 
               <p>No pains were spared upon plans, in which both elegance and convenience were combined. Dwight's judgment and taste were evoked, and I was often summoned to the consultation, as Mr. Sprague very justly declared, that only a woman understood domestic needs.</p> 
               <p>Christmas brought Addy a wax doll and a <emph>skin</emph> baby, only the skin baby was her aunty's. "It was not dood for much now only to cry and mate faces, but it would grow and get cunning"</p> 
               <p>The skin baby, as well as his mother, flourished finely, and in due time I had the pleasure to present my little Philip Bradshaw at the baptismal fount, where his father and grandfather had been consecrated.</p> 
               <p>Christmas also placed Mira among the matrons of the land. As had been anticipated, Mr. Carnes received the election and immediately took his seat in Congress. By the side of her talented and distinguished husband, Mira rose to an exalted position, which she filled with dignity and sweetness,-a blessing to her family and to society, one "whom her husband could praise as he sat with the elders in the gates."</p> 
               <p>The New Year brought a meeting of the creditors of the bankrupt firm of "Rutledge and Lee," at which their honorable conduct was highly commended, and all farther claims generously cancelled. As the parties were fully able to extend this liberality, it was accepted in the free, manly spirit in which it was proffered, and the proceedings closed by a supper, from which the gentlemen separated with renewed expressions of friendship and regard.</p> 
               <p>The morning after this satisfactory negotiation, James entered my room; throwing himself into a rocking-chair, with his feet on the fender, he leaned leisurely back, complacently eyeing me as I tended my baby.</p> 
               <p>"Well, Jessie, I must say I feel like a new man; no one in the wide world can say that I owe them a sou."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, there is one."</p> 
               <p>"What!" he returned, with an amazed start.</p> 
               <p>"You owe fifty dollars."</p> 
               <p>"Fifty dollars; to whom? Oh, it is to that big gentleman, is it? Must Godpapa launch out so largely for a mug?"</p> 
               <p>"You mistake; this is a real bona-fide debt. You owe Polly Brown fifty dollars, advanced for Addy's clothes in our direst extremity."</p> 
               <p>"Jessie, why did you not mention this before?"</p> 
               <p>"Because Polly would not permit it. She was saved while Genevieve was taken, and she considers it a duty, as it certainly is a pleasure, to contribute to Addy's welfare and happiness."</p> 
               <p>My cousin's head sank upon his hands. In silence, he thus sat for some moments; the face that at length turned to mine was pale and serious.</p> 
               <p>"How I did underrate that girl, Jessie! To think that I should ever have looked down upon her as I did,-so scoffed and derided her brave efforts for self-culture. I hate myself, scorn myself, as I recall my foolish blindness and pride. Thank heaven, you and Genevieve had more reason!</p> 
               <p>"But how am I to cancel this obligation? It will not do to regard it in the light of a regular business transaction; and Polly would not accept a gift of such value. I must express my obligation, my gratitude,-the sense I entertain of her affection and goodness; how can I do it? You must help me, Madam Wisdom."</p> 
                
               <p>I raised my eyes and gazed steadily into his, murmuring, in a low tone, "Open your whole heart to her, tell her all; all from the beginning."</p> 
               <p>My cousin's cheek flushed with an inquiring look; he glanced from Genevieve's portrait back to me.</p> 
               <p>"She would approve," I smilingly returned. "You have breasted your troubles nobly; go and receive your reward."</p> 
               <p>"I fear you are too sanguine. Polly knows me too well; knows what a puffed up coxcomb I have been; she cannot regard me as you imply."</p> 
               <p>"Faint heart never won fair lady."</p> 
               <p>James smiled. "True, fair Minerva, but your proposal seems altogether too Quixotic. I never thought myself a coward; but I declare the magnificent Polly often makes me quail. I will think the matter over; the debt must be cancelled some way," and with a kiss to baby and his mother, the gentleman turned away.</p> 
               <p>Peggy, who was sweeping, and knew nothing of the previous colloquy, waylaid him on the stairs with the inquiry "Of when he and Polly Brown were going to setup housekeeping together? Ye are a free man now. Polly is getting worn down since she's been head schoolmarm; ye'd better look out a house, Jim Lee."</p> 
               <p>With an impatient "pish," James put the old woman aside, and passed out, banging the street door hastily behind him.</p> 
               <p>Peggy gave a low chuckle, and I watched with some curiosity, as he paced the green on Fort Hill. The circle having been perambulated some twenty times, my relative turned and disappeared in the direction of the store.</p> 
               <p>Dwight came alone at noon. James was busy and would dine down town. My husband was hilarious over a letter received that morning from Job, which quaintly informed us of his intention of espousing Hannah Mixer. The surprise could not have been greater had Peggy declared matrimonial designs. Dwight thought Job must nave scratched his pate bald, ere he mustered courage to propose; and the idea of Miss Betty's prim waiting-maid condescending to love passages, was overwhelming. The mirth was increased by the entrance of Polly Brown, who had stolen from her arduous duties on this half-holiday, to take a peep at the newly-arrived gentleman and to congratulate his parents.</p> 
               <p>Polly wondered who would be married next.</p> 
               <p>"It must be you, Peggy. I do believe you have been flirting with that widower up on Fort Hill, who inquired if you could be induced to leave Mrs. Sprague."</p> 
               <p>"Oh, gammon! Ye needn't think to take me in, Miss Brown! Ye are to be the next bride! I shall dance at yer wedding-for I mean to dance at it-within three months, and I'll make yer cake, too. I can make it better than any Boston confectionarier; there no force with cooking butter, and the Lord knows what spice!"</p> 
               <p>"Pho, Peggy; you are not Goody Sloper, and I wouldn't give a snap of my finger for all your predictions; but mind, I'll hold you to that promise of the cake."</p> 
               <p>"My word is jest as good as a bond, and I'll give my word on't. Now, jest you come here and rock the cradle a few minutes. I'm gwine to put up this screen, for so much light is not good for little 'Squire; and don't talk to Jessie for a while; she must rest on the sofa a spell, then you may gabble as much as you like."</p> 
               <p>I passed a new book to my friend, Peggy placed the screen, and I laid down. Silence, broken only by the ticking of my watch, and the humming<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6399-00000124"/> of the wood fire, settled over the room. I had just begun to doze, when a quick step resounded in the passage, a hurried tap, and James entered.</p> 
               <p>"Did I wake you, Jessie? I was sorry to disturb you! but I have concluded to take your advice, and Polly is at leisure this evening. Cannot you write a note, just a line to pave the way. You see I have no confidence in the success of this suit; but if Polly could read my heart, I think she would forgive by-gones. Do you believe I can make her understand my deep, my ardent admiration, my unspeakable love?"</p> 
               <p>"Ask her!" I exclaimed, as pulling aside the screen, I caught up the babe, and made my exit to the parlor beyond, leaving Polly standing before her lover, like a figure in a tableau vivante.</p> 
               <p>Though sanguine as to the denouement, the effort to renew my siesta entirely failed. I could only strain my ears, over the muffled tones issuing from the inner apartment.</p> 
               <p>At the end of an hour, Polly parted the sliding doors. One glance revealed the whole; I need not fear.</p> 
               <p>"Oh, Jessie, how inconsiderate in us to keep you here so. I had no idea it was such a time!"</p> 
               <p>"Cupid seldom notes the hours," I rejoined, as I stepped forward and pressed my lips to Polly's hot cheek. James clasped my hand in silence. Instinctively, each eye turned to the speaking likeness of Genevieve, which hung over the mantel. At that instant, the sun which, for the past half-hour had been obscured, suddenly broke forth in roseate hues, lighting up the sweet face which seemed to smile down upon the group. James drew Polly closer, as tears rose to his eyes; while she, hiding her face on his shoulder, sobbed out a petition for worthiness to fill the place of the angel that had gone.</p> 
               <p>Addy broke in upon this scene, with uproarious delight at the presence of her dear, darling Polly. Peggy followed to attend to her duties as nurse; but as Polly passed out with her affianced, she slyly whispered: "Jest let me know in season to begin that cake."</p> 
               <p>Much to our amusement, for once, Dwight was completely dumbfounded. His face might have been a study for himself, as on his return to tea the new engagement was announced. He had hoped for it some day, but really, between Job and Polly, he had got a stitch in his back. He hoped neither Peggy nor Jake would announce an intention of going off that night, as there was fear that he might not survive the shock.</p> 
               <p>The evening was a most happy one, and the following morning James rejoiced Peggy with the tidings that her prediction would be verified; she might begin the cake in two months, and he should look out a house directly. "Peggy was right; Polly was working too hard; he thanked her for mentioning it; Polly had cared for others too long already, henceforth, it should be his care and delight that she should be ministered to as much as she ministered."</p> 
               <p>The tears stood in the old woman's eyes, as, laying her hand kindly on his arm, she feelingly returned, "Never forgit them words, Jim Lee; allers remember'em. Polly has loved you all these years as gals seldom love; treasure her as God's best gift till yer dying day."</p> 
               <p>Silently clasping his humble friend's hand, James lightly pressed his lips to the wrinkled brow, and went forth to commence the day's labor. Peggy sank upon a seat, and sobbed softly. I well knew what remembrance was working in her breast, but as she never could brook words at such seasons, I could only pay the tributes of silent sympathy.</p> 
               <p>Three busy, gladsome months and bright, breezy March brought the bridal day. Lieutenant Brown's large house, now not only neat, but elegant, soon after sundown became thronged with relatives and friends from far and near. The whole domicile grew gay with light and festal garniture.</p> 
               <p>Peggy sliced her brown, frost-crowned loaves with huge satisfaction. "She'd raly beat herself this time; to be sure she had plenty of ingrevients, but law-sakes, what was things if ye did n't know how to put 'em together? Miss Prime should have a thick slice, so she might <emph>see cake</emph> afore she died!"</p> 
               <p>At James' particular request, Uncle Sam, now the Rev. Mr. Stuart, a celebrated Methodist divine, had been summoned to tie the nuptial knot.</p> 
               <p>Polly was perfectly regal in her simple yet rich bridal suit. Supported by a band of young sisters lovely as Hebes and surrounded by an admiring and lovely crowd, the holy ceremony was solemnized with even more than the clergyman's usual impressiveness.</p> 
               <p>We could but revert to another and far different occasion, when last his voice had spoken to us in public. A few tears were shed, followed by smiles, kisses and congratulations. The cake and wine having been duly honored, Joseph Osborn appeared bearing his violin.</p> 
               <p>Peggy's threat had been slyly treasured. Now, while Dwight led forth the bride, James advanced, and bringing Peggy forward placed her second in the set.</p> 
               <p>The old woman gave some awful grimaces, declaring "she wasn't going to be made a fool of in that fashion"; but as the Lieutenant and Mrs. Brown took their places immediately below her, and the long lines quickly adjusted themselves, her voice was drowned in music.</p> 
               <p>"Down the middle," "hands around," "up the side," Peggy, not-withstanding her adjurations, found herself fairly dancing at Polly's wedding.</p> 
               <p>Goody Sloper, in her brown silk and tasty cap, opined "That she was shorn of her laurels,-Peggy had turned witch in her stead."</p> 
               <p>This first dance set every one in motion, both young and old; the amusement continued till the small hours, when the company dispersed, with the unanimous opinion that there had not been such a blithesome wedding since Ruthy's famous nuptials.</p> 
               <p>A fortnight's tour to New York, and the newly-married pair settled quietly in a new and commodious house at the West-end.</p> 
               <p>For a while I was grievously astray without my chatterbox Addy, and as James had been a constant inmate of the family since my marriage, he also was greatly missed; but increasing household cares, and the frequent calls upon my time, solicited by Mr. and Madam Sprague in reference to their new mansion, which was now rapidly approaching completion, left little space for loneliness.</p> 
               <p>I must select the wall paper, and supervise the hanging; various ornamental finishings must also pass under my cognition; next, the French furniture arrived. I must superintend the unpacking, and select others to match, for the inferior rooms as well as to obtain kitchen fixtures. Finally came carpet-making and settling of the movables.</p> 
               <p>Work, work, went busy hands all through the long summer days, till the end of August brought completion. Carpets were stretched, curtains, mirrors and pictures hung, every appendage in its place from cellar to attic; china closets, pantries and wine vault<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6399-00000125"/> were filled; the retinue of servants engaged; everything put in readiness for the arrival of Mr. and Mrs. Mason, who were expected in one of the ships belonging to the firm, which was now due.</p> 
               <p>After days of waiting, Sunday evening brought the tidings that the "Arbella" was coming up the harbor. Dwight sought the wharf, while I hurried to Summer street to apprise the domestics, and welcome the wanderers to their new home.</p> 
               <p>Plate and china having been unlocked, everything put in train for a hospitable repast, I went over the rooms, giving a last, final touch, till even my quick eye could discover nothing to improve. Nothing was left but to wait. The sun was setting, but not knowing how long the ship would take to reach her mooring, I experienced no disquiet.</p> 
               <p>Opening one of the front parlor blinds, I sat down to watch the well-dressed throng, passing in Sunday decorum. The god of day sank into his golden couch; the long, soft twilight deepened into a still, dark summer night; nine o'clock was pealed from the church towers; the busy tread began to slacken, till only here and there a footfall echoed over the pavement. The housekeeper, with a wondering face, came with a light.</p> 
               <p>"I thought you would like a lamp Mrs. Sprague; where do you suppose they are?"</p> 
               <p>A secret dread for the past hour had been stealing over me,-a presentiment of coming evil. I looked in the woman's face to see if I could read a reflection of these feelings there, and asked if she had expected the passengers could have landed earlier.</p> 
               <p>"Certainly; they ought to have been here an hour ago at the latest."</p> 
               <p>The sound of wheels interrupted us the vehicle rapidly approached, then stopped. They had come; I ran below, followed by Mrs. Clarence. Dwight met me at the stair's foot. One glance at his white face was sufficient! My foreboding had not been causeless!</p> 
               <p>"What is it, Dwight?" I gasped, clutching his arm.</p> 
               <p>"Cousin Lucretia died two days ago, from hmorrhage of the lungs. Her body has been brought on shore, coffined, and, accompanied by her husband, despatched on its Way to Sprague Farm. I must follow immediately, in order to arrive in season to break the news to the family, and forward preparations for the reception of the corpse."</p> 
               <p>Mrs. Mason had been long an invalid; but recent advices had spoken so encouragingly, that we were wholly unprepared for this visitation. Bending his head, my husband murmured, "O, Jessie, how can I tell uncle and aunt? What can I say?" and hiding his face on my shoulder for a moment, the strong man wept like a little child.</p> 
               <p>Hard as the task imposed, I knew it must be fulfilled; that Dwight was the proper one to convey the distressing intelligence to the childless parents, now bereft of their last remaining hope.</p> 
               <p>Soothingly leading him to the dining-room, I ordered lights and tea. "Mr. Sprague must have some refreshment before he commenced his long midnight ride."</p> 
               <p>The awe-struck servants hurried hither and thither, the meal was almost instantly in readiness, and Dwight and I sat down alone, face to face, to the first repast ever served in the new house. A cold shiver coursed through my veins as I took my chair, and with a trembling hand lifted the richly-chased silver pot, and filled the beautifully enamelled, translucent cups, while the magnificent appointments of the spacious room seemed emblazoned with the words, "Vanity of vanities, riches and honor is given, nothing ing is wanting, yet God giveth not the power to eat thereof. Vanity of vanities, all is vanity."</p> 
               <p>My husband glancing up, caught my look; his thought followed mine. Gravely surveying the handsome apartment, he slowly repeated, "I made me great works, I builded me houses, I planted me gardens, I gathered me also silver and gold, I got me servants and maidens, and whatsoever mine eyes desired, I kept not from them; and behold all was vanity!' 'Dear wife, let us remember 'that he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap,' 'Fear God and keep His commandments, and the Lord shall deliver us from every evil work, and preserve us unto his heavenly kingdom, to whom be glory forever and ever, Amen.'"</p> 
               <p>A moment of solemn, tearful silence, then Dwight rose, and in a subdued voice, directed my future arrangements. I was to go forward in the morning, accompanied by James and Polly, and the Rev. Mr. McLerland, an Episcopal clergyman, a friend of Mr. Mason's, and a fellow passenger, who would conduct the funeral rites.</p> 
               <p>Seven o'clock struck the following morning, as the carriage with its mourning inmates rolled over Charles-town bridge. The day was overcast; a wailing south wind, with occasional showers, sobbed in unison with our grief. My infant, which I had been impelled to take, grew restless, longed for, yet dreaded, the journey's end. Little had been spoken for the past hour, familiar objects began to open on the vision. The academy, the meeting-house, the parsonage, then the stone boundary walls of the broad avenue, with the gay box-bordered garden, and the imposing facade of the large mansion. Groups of farm laborers, with serious faces, loitered about the farm-house gates; the blinds of the great house were all down; a solemn silence pervaded the premises. The coach slowly moved up to the grand portico, the door opened, Dwight came forward and handed me out. "Go directly to Aunt Sprague's dressing-room, Jessie," he whispered. Polly was about to take little Philip, but Dwight interposed. 44 No, aunt has inquired for him, he must go with his mother." Making my way through the bewildered housemaids, past the coffin which had been placed in the hall, I reached a back room on the ground floor, which Madam Sprague, on account of her lameness, had appropriated in preference to those above. Mr. Sprague met me on the threshold, wringing my hand in tearful silence, he led me to his wife. I sank beside her, while she clasped me with hysterical sobs. "Oh, Jessie, Jessie, I am so glad you are here! I thought you would never come; you are my only comfort now; but do go and fix my poor girl! They have let me look at her, but I wouldn't only glance; she does not look like my Lucretia. They have not done her hair familiarly, and her robe needs adjusting!" Sobs stopped farther utterance.</p> 
               <p>Kissing the wan cheek, I rose with promises to do everything needful. The babe in my arms, hungry and tired, gave a sharp cry. Madam Sprague looked from her handkerchief: "Oh, you have the little boy; give him to me," she said, stretching forth her arms. Much to my surprise, the little fellow permitted the old lady to disencumber him of cap and cloak. "Jessie, I have been selfish as usual; attend to this little comfort, and refresh yourself, before anything. Dear little fellow, how I love to feel his soft limbs! Only think, Jessie, six babes have I held in these arms, and the last lays out there, stark and cold!"</p> 
               <p>I tried to say, "Not there; six angels await you in heaven." Though my<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6399-00000126"/> voice was incoherent, my meaning was gathered. "Jessie, you are my comfort,-you and Dwight! Mrs. Lee is here, is she not? I must see her. She will do up Lueretia's hair."</p> 
               <p>"Polly will assist; but, dear aunt, please to permit me the sad pleasure of these last duties. Let me stand in a daughter's place."</p> 
               <p>"You do, you do, my darling! You and Dwight are our only children now."</p> 
               <p>Mr. Sprague had entered as she spoke. Taking my hand, in tremulous accents, he added: "Our only children! My dear daughter, do everything that is right; everything that is proper. The housekeeper seems dazed; the whole household is in confusion. I understand your capacity, and give everything up to you and your husband's direction."</p> 
               <p>As Mr. Sprague had said, the housekeeper, a faithful woman, resident in the family from childhood, was quite beside herself. There was much to attend to, much to do; but the mournful preparations were complete at ten o'clock the next morning, when the beautiful service of the English church was read, and the last daughter of that stately house rested in the tomb beside her sister.</p> 
               <p>Mr. Mason, a reserved, haughty man, had never been a favorite with Mr. Sprague or his wife. Now, notwithstanding the consideration attached to their daughter's husband, all parties were relieved at the end of a fortnight by his return to his home in Virginia.</p> 
               <p>Dwight and I had anticipated spending the two remaining weeks of September at the parsonage, but we found it impossible to leave his bereaved relatives. Our companionship seemed their only earthly consolation, and the babe was Madam Sprague's especial comfort. Besides, Dwight, at his aunt's request, was painting a full-length portrait of Mrs. Mason, from a sketch taken previous to her marriage; a picture to match that of her deceased sister.</p> 
               <p>Though I regretted not being able to enjoy the quiet of the parsonage, the days passed most agreeably, bringing a renewal of acquaintance which had become endeared whilst I was a member of the "Young Ladies' Seminary." Foremost amongst these was Dr. Parkinson.</p> 
               <p>An almost daily visitor at the "Farm," his genial presence brought bright gleams of consolation to the stricken household.</p> 
               <p>Madam Sprague had been excessively scandalized by an essay against Episcopacy, from the pen of the celebrated Dr. Kirkwood. One afternoon, Dr. Parkinson came in, bearing a newspaper, which he handed to me, pointing out a particular paragraph. From the mischievous twinkle of his eye, I knew that he was greatly diverted. Folding down the column I read aloud as directed, "That Miss Kirkwood, a sister of the distinguished divine of that name, had the Sunday previous received the right of confirmation at Christ Church, Boston. The lady having been inducted into Episcopacy, through an investigation of its doctrines induced by her brother's severe criticism."</p> 
               <p>"Good," said Dwight. "Such severe strictures generally conduce to an end exactly opposite to the one intended."</p> 
               <p>"Like Squire Benson, doctor," interposed Madam Sprague, good-naturedly, "who declares that your famous Federalist sermon turned him Democratic."</p> 
               <p>The doctor laughed. "Dwight ought to thank me for that, he is one of the party's great guns."</p> 
               <p>"Humph! I have no especial faith in great guns, either political or clerical."</p> 
               <p>"Am I to regard that as complimentary or otherwise?"</p> 
                
               <p>"Oh, you know the old adage, 'If the coat fits, etc.' but seriously, doctor, do you think any permanent good is derived from political sermons? Is the Sabbath or pulpit either a time or place for partisan themes?"</p> 
               <p>"Well, sir, you know that is a close question, but I am willing to own that if I could live my ministry over I should leave unsaid much that has been spoken. Not that I will yield one point to you, Sir Democrat. I had the truth, as far as is given to fallible mortals, but it was not taught in a proper spirit. No one ought to render himself 'a rock of offence' to his fellow-men. But I have asked pardon of those to whom I became 'a stumbling block,' and therein was the error; I ought not to have become that stumbling block through overmuch zeal. If a minister will thoroughly preach and live the doctrines of Christ, I think he may leave his people to choose their course in subordinate matters without anxiety. If homage is rendered to Caesar through six days, one certainly ought to be devoted to that of the Lord without, as you properly term it, partisan themes. It is the duty of the clergy to render the nation a godly nation. If that is not the result, they are no servants of Christ, and the nation cannot stand, however broad their dominions, superior their politics, or brilliant their statesmanship."</p> 
               <p>How often since, have I recalled these words of the superior and renowned preacher, the exalted scholar, and true Christian gentleman.</p> 
               <p>October necessitated a return to the city. James must go South; Peggy was clamorous for my presence; the portrait also had been completed The evening prior to our departure, it was hung in its place, presenting most lifelike semblance of the original. Mr. Sprague lingered long over the work, inspecting its minutest details, then turning to Dwight, and kindly placing his hand on his shoulder, he said:</p> 
               <p>"I cannot bid you to wholly relinquish business; our affairs will not permit it; but hire another clerk,-that will afford leisure for art study. Mrs. Sprague, cannot you spare a room in your new house for a studio?"</p> 
               <p>"My new house!"</p> 
               <p>"Yes, my dear; the Summer-street house is yours, only you will be encumbered with the two old people in the winter."</p> 
               <p>Both Dwight and I tried to speak our gratitude, but we were not allowed. Madam Sprague laughed at my amazed look, declaring, "I should grace the White House if Dwight could only place me there," while her husband, gravely bending, touched his lips to my brow, whispering, "Am I reinstated in your good opinion, dear Jessie. I desire to make ample restitution."</p> 
               <p>"He was, he had," returning the caress, I assured him of my respect as well as love.</p> 
               <p>I had never before shared my husband's tenderness towards his uncle, but from that hour he was wholly forgiven.</p> 
               <p>A few weeks later saw us established in our sumptuous home, but neither Dwight nor myself ever forgot the overshadowing of the death angel that had first greeted us there. Thankful for signal mercies, we diligently strove, to walk ourselves and to lead others in the steps of the Master unto God.</p> 
            </div> 
            <div type="chapter"> 
               <head>CHAPTER XL.</head> 
               <head type="sub">THE VOCATION ACHIEVED.</head> 
               <p>TEN years had sped. Sped with the joy and harmony of a marriage bell. True, there had been the shifting lights and shades of ordinary life, and Death<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6399-00000127"/> had claimed several of our aged friends, but these had gone in the fulness of years, shocks of corn fully ripe, ready to be gathered to the garner of the Lord. Merry voices and busy feet, feet pattering a refrain to chattering tongues, rendered the large house vocal from rosy morn to dewy eve. Feet and tongues, that, as they increased, but augmented the love and, brightness of the household.</p> 
               <p>Each succeeding winter, Mr. and Madam Sprague had been beloved and welcome guests. Through her nephew's exertions and the influence of the children, who would not permit even dear aunty's gouty feet to rest, Madam Sprague's health became much improved; canes and cushions were banished, and the old lady acquired a cheerfulness unknown in younger and undimmed years. To Mr. Sprague, time brought a still greater change than to his wife. Few who had only known the reserved, haughty merchant, would have recognized the genial, courteous country gentleman. The enthusiastic agriculturist, the promoter of every scientific, literary, artistic or benevolent object, his society was widely sought, his days brought satisfaction, and his nights the sweet repose of an untroubled conscience. Happy in himself, and a blessing and joy to his family and the community, he presented the true type of a New England gentleman and a Christian man. For the first few years, business engrossed so much of Dwight's time that little leisure was found for art studies, but gradually, this changed, till painting became the labor, and business the recreation.</p> 
               <p>Gradually, too, the studio which his uncle had fitted up for him became a sealed place, a sort of secret Blue Beard chamber, of which even I was not vouchsafed the key. Luckily, not possessing, Fatima's curiosity my equanimity did not become disturbed, but poor Peggy could not conceal her chagrin, which increased as the years rolled on. "What did I s'pose that boy" (dear Peggy! Dwight and I would always be boy and girl in her eyes),-"What did I think he could be doing, and what sort of a place did I s'pose that studio could be with not a broom nor cluster in it, to her sartin knowledge, for mor'n five year? She had peeped through the key-hole, but all she could see was a great thing like a sheet; she s'posed it was a pictur, but Mr. Sprague and Jim Lee, and them painter gentlemen had all been up the past week, and Jake went up yesterday, and there was sich a banging about she went onto the private staircase, but Dwight had the imperdence to ask her if she hadn't better see that the cook didn't spoil the dinner!" A portentous huff. "The dinner! sakes alive; he didn't gammon me, and it's my private opinion that some picters went off to this picter exhibition, that these artist folks have been so busy getting up."</p> 
               <p>My private opinion coincided with Peggy's to the slightest minutia, but I made no demonstration and restrained hers, well knowing that the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">denouement</foreign> would come in good time.</p> 
               <p>The very next morning, Peggy's heart was rejoiced by an order to have the studio thoroughly cleaned. The good woman had made such a bugbear of the chamber, that the kitchen feminines scarcely durst venture thither, and I was besought to lead the van up the narrow, dark stairs leading to the mysterious apartment. Nothing weird nor uncanny greeted our eyes; nothing save the usual adjuncts of a painter's room. Peggy was obliged to confess "That it looked remarkably well considering how long it had been given up to men folks."</p> 
               <p>Our investigations were interrupted by a summons below. Dwight awaited Peggy and myself, with an invitation to visit the new picture-gallery. "The rooms are not open to the public till to-morrow. You will have a nice opportunity to study the paintings at leisure."</p> 
               <p>Tying on our bonnets, we proceeded, with our escort, to the old Athenaeum building on Pearl street. My husband led the way to the second floor, pushing aside a door. The Spinning Bee in the parsonage kitchen, beamed upon our astonished and bewildered vision.</p> 
               <p>At that instant, we were joined by Major and Mrs. Lee. Polly grasped my hand in sympathetic silence, while her admiring gaze sought the canvas, James placed a chair for Peggy, into which she sank, with a long-drawn respiration.</p> 
               <p>The artist had depicted the moment when the fun and frolic of the evening were at their height. The blazing logs of the huge fire irradiated the large room, developing every familiar household appanage and domestic utensil. On the hearth stood Peggy, the quart silver tankard in her outstretched hand, waiting to receive the red-hot loggerhead which Job was poising for a dexterous dash into the carefully compounded "flip."</p> 
               <p>The game of "Spinning the Platter" gaily progressed. I, in the centre of the foreground, with a roguish sparkle, twirled the pewter plate, slyly eyeing Dwight, who, in the mid distance, assisted Polly to polish a huge dish of apples on the dresser. Ruthy and Joe Osborn were redeeming a forfeit in the corner by the tall clock. Ann Norton reclined in an arm-chair opposite, attended by a band of beaux, amongst whom Jonas Prime, decorated with an immense silver watch-chain and key, was conspicuous.</p> 
               <p>Ranged about the apartment, were other well-known faces. Old Uron stood in the entrance of the half-open door; the linen wheels loomed in the background; and the skeins of yarn upon the wall, attested to the day's industry. After a few moments of silent inspection, Peggy, with a superlative huff of approbation, burst forth into words.</p> 
               <p>"Well, I must say, that picter is what I call somethin' clever, though we had six flatirons instead of four on the mantle-shelf; and the holder on the nail by the oven lid was 'pine tree' instead of 'Job's trouble'; but the tinder-box is in the right place, and them candlesticks look as if you could take 'em and light the candles. Job's King's-arm is all right, too, in the hooks over the chimney-piece; and you have got my inkle loom and thread case, scissors and pin ball, jest as they used to hang by the cupboard door; and there's the civits toasting-fork and chaffing dish on their nails in the chimney corner, and, as I live, the old 'Moses' on the long trammel at the end of the crane, jest where I used to keep it to card wool by; don't you remember the old tin jigamree, Jessie,-half lamp, half feeder, that we used to burn fish ile in; I can recolleet when they were all the ile lamps there was; the shoemakers all worked by 'em, and every shop had a wooden funnel passed up through the ruff to carry off their smoke and stench. Well, times has altered! Then do look at the dresser! Who but Dwight could have drawn out every identical basin, platter, plate and cup, even to the cracked pitcher Job hooped with tin. Well, we was economical in those days! You've done the pewter platters and porringers justice, Dwight, and I'm glad on't, for the folks that's rising up won't know what they be. Dear suz, how truly the boys and gals are pictered out; and Job and me. Job has changed some, and I spose I have too, though I feel jest as young as ever. That's jest yer cunning<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6399-00000128"/> ning look when ye was bent on plaguing Dwight, Jessie; but Polly, folks won't ever believe that's you, though the magnificent Mrs. Lee needn't be ashamed of her old self; but to see her now,-who would dream Ann Norton was such a beauty. Mrs. Prime must feel sore to see how faded and yellow, she has grown; but beauty that's only skin deep don't wear well. Won't Ruthy and Joe laugh? Such a staid couple! Well, 'twont hurt 'em to look back to when they was boy and gal together. Folks ought to improve and advance as they go on from year to year, but still it is best not to outgrow some youthful feelings if people do pronounce them follies. I'm thinking sometimes young people's silliness is wiser than older people's sense; at any rate, it isn't half as calculating and worldly. Well, Dwight, ye know I allers said ye'd do somethin if ye lived long enough, me and Aunt Judy allers stuck to that, through thick and thin, dark and light; and I must say ye tried our faith sorely sometimes, but we allers said you would be an honor to yer family and yer country. Aunt Judy and the master must see this."</p> 
               <p>"Yes, they will both be here tomorrow with Mr. and Mrs. Carnes, Miss Kate Donaldson, and other friends; but I wished to exhibit these to you privately to-day. Let me turn your chair, Peggy, there is a twin painting awaiting inspection opposite."</p> 
               <p>The group hastily turned, and gazed as directed at a picture of the same size which faced the other.</p> 
               <p>The rosy dawn of an April morning glinted on the small-paned casements of an old-fashioned homestead, and lighted a stretch of undulating landscape, through which wound a wide country road, lined by brown farmhouses and improved lands; beyond, swept a broad blue stream; the farther shore, bounded by a chain of rolling hills, some wooded to the summit, others presenting marks of cultivation and pasturage.</p> 
               <p>The usual rural life of the spring morn had evidently been disturbed. Patient kine lowed in the barnyards, wonderingly awaiting the tardy milkmaids. Sheep, huddled under the stone walls, vainly bleat for the customary care. Groups of men and women, on foot and on horseback, hurried forward; loaded teams rumbled heavily on; men, women, and teams all tending to one central point, a spot where the highway opened into a common, green with newly springing verdure, where, in warlike accoutrements, drawn up in martial array, stood a dark group, momently increased by comrades bearing firelock, powder-flask and cartridge box, hastening over the fields, through the winding lanes and along the broad highway, coming from every direction, in the homespun suits and cocked hats of the period.</p> 
               <p>On a rude stand, improvised from some boards thrown across an ox-cart, stood the black-gowned parson, his white wig and bands fluttering in the morning breeze, his hands outstretched, as he invoked the Divine protection and blessing on the brave hearts and bowed heads at his feet,-sturdy yeomen ready to do and die for their home arid country.</p> 
               <p>In the dooryard of the farmhouse in the foreground, stood a blooming damsel, in short gown and petticoat, the brown curls bursting from the hasty knot into which they had been twined. Maidenly tenderness contended with womanly firmness on the handsome, expressive face. Love beamed in the soft, thoughtful eyes, and a forced smile played round the grieved, yet resolute, mouth. Courageously, encouragingly, the shapely, but toil-embrowned hand returns the salute of the stalwart young soldier just beyond the low bar-rails that separate the green dooryard from the dusty thoroughfare. A tall, stout farmer, rich in health and youth, whose feet are bearing him to strife and carnage, while his heart and gaze are with peace and love. The dark curls cluster above the white brow and shade the bronzed cheek, as waving his hat above his head, with a look denoting the bravery of the lion, and the gentleness of the dove, he bestows the last parting benison upon his youthful love.</p> 
               <p>One instinctively felt that this was to be the last interchange of glances; that this was a final earthly adieu; that when next those lingering looks should melt into one, it would be in that world where there shall be no more curse, neither sorrow nor pain, for the former things have passed away.</p> 
               <p>Yet, one could not mourn for the hero that his country forever will honor, or grieve for the maiden, rich in such love and such memories.</p> 
               <p>No catalogue was needed to show that the picture memorialized the historical nineteenth of April, and the gathering of "Minute-men" on learning the tidings of the battle of Lexington, but only the privileged few could know that it recorded the life-romance of an aged spinster one of the world's "old maids," but heaven's registered wives. Through this earthly pilgrimage, a widow indeed and desolate, but trusting in God to obtain that resurrection where they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are equal unto the angels in glory.</p> 
               <p>For a time, Peggy sat frigid, unmovable; then the wrinkled face worked spasmodically, and the withered hands were hysterically clasped over the streaming eyes.</p> 
               <p>Polly and I tenderly twined our arms about her; James and Dwight drew affectionately to her side.</p> 
               <p>This emotion was short-lived. The good woman had governed her feelings too many years to permit them long to overcome her now. Quietly returning my caress, she turned a sad, curiously-amazed, almost awe-struck, glance towards Dwight, and slowly, shyly whispered, "How could you do it, boy! How could you picter <emph>him</emph> so?"</p> 
               <p>"Is it like, Peggy? Have I hit a resemblance?"</p> 
               <p>"It is perfect, jest as he looked back and waved his hat. Seems as though he must speak,-how did you do it, boy?"</p> 
               <p>"From your description, Peggy; entirely from the vivid pictures you used to paint of your heroic lover."</p> 
               <p>"And you began this painting when you was a lad at the master's?"</p> 
               <p>"Yes; both were designed the first winter I was his pupil; but Peggy, why do you not praise my skill in portraying yourself. I know it is a good likeness, for I took Squire Norton into the studio after the figure was completed, and he said it was a living resemblance of what you were at that period."</p> 
               <p>"Well, I dunno; it's so long since I was a gal I've most forgot. I guess you've flattered me some. So you've had these picters in yer head all these years!"</p> 
               <p>"Yes; and through every trial and disappointment, the faith held strong that they would be painted. I felt that they were a part of my life's work, and could but believe that God would vouchsafe the opportunity for its accomplishment."</p> 
               <p>Silence settled over the group, as every eye sought the picture with retrospective thoughts too great for utterance. Then Peggy, slowly rising, solemnly placed her hands on Dwight's head and gravely replied, "It pleased the Lord for a time to lead you through<pb n="244" xml:id="VAC6399-00000129"/> devious ways and crooked paths, but now we see how they all guided, winding and tangled as they were, to this broad, even track of prosperity and happiness. Never despair, my children! Work in your might and the fear of God, and his salvation shall be given to you. 'Trust ye in the Lord forever; for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength.'"</p>
