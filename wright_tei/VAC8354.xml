.Awake, awake! Jtdah,, Ay beloved son I&#xD;
Again thesun rises over the mountains of&#xD;
Israel, and the daughter of, Zion still, lies in&#xD;
chains." So Miriam,'the wife of Matathia,&#xD;
woke all Ier sons every 'morning witih.the&#xD;
rising of theun.- Judah rose and beating&#xD;
his breastwith his, right  and he invoked&#xD;
the Deity to hear:again hisvow.   If .Ifor-&#xD;

forget me;" said he. "Mere I again vow&#xD;
not to taste of the cup, of joy until shame&#xD;
and subjectiQn be banished from thehousQ&#xD;
of Israel."  Then he clasped his -sword&#xD;
and Mswungit'over his head: " AgainIen-&#xD;
secrate this, sword to' the liberty and inde-&#xD;
pendence of my people,to avenge Israel on&#xD;
its atrocious'enemies."j&#xD;
The hoary priest Matathia and his five&#xD;
sons,,repeated this vow every morning ever,&#xD;
after Antioehus' Epiphanes,-lthe=despot o&#xD;

and nationality of Israel, and committedthe,&#xD;

that God only cbastises us on account of our&#xD;

"More than this I expected of thee, fath-&#xD;
er Matathia," said the stranger. "But first&#xD;
Swill finish niy narrative, then we shall ar-&#xD;
gte. None can count the number of men&#xD;
that were killed, because they observedathe&#xD;
comn ndiments, because they read the words&#xD;
of thy od and mine. The delicate daugh-&#xD;
ters of Zon, sire, the mothers in Israel who&#xD;
expiredin the hands of the executioner, be-&#xD;
cause they circumcised their children, are&#xD;
innumerable.' I have seen women hanged&#xD;
'with their children suspended on their necks&#xD;
bause they taught them 'The Law which&#xD;
Mosescommanded us, a heritage of the con-&#xD;
gregation of Tacob. But I shall tell thee&#xD;
the particulars in but one instance. Han-&#xD;
nah is the name of the pious woman that&#xD;
had' seven sons, all brought up in the fear of&#xD;
the Lord.' I have seen them, sire, I have,&#xD;
nwn them well. Wisdom, beauty and&#xD;
virtue never chose finer symbols to present&#xD;
themselves to the eyes of man than the sons&#xD;
of Iannah. They were the pride, the only&#xD;
hope' of their happy mother, and the good&#xD;
ample of the people. The captain with a&#xD;
host.of Syrians came to Bethlehem.  'In&#xD;

- commanded us, Thou shalt have;no other&#xD;

f anger split the head of the pious youth and&#xD;
threw the dead body, at thefeet of the tear-&#xD;
less -mother. Three -rmore.of the sons 'of&#xD;
Hannah were thus summoned to bow down&#xD;

there cruelly slain when the seventhewas ac-&#xD;

"Mine is the silver and mine is the gold,&#xD;

the first time during this horrid hour, tears&#xD;
filled the eyes of the mother. She embra-&#xD;
ced and kissed her child, pressed him eon-&#xD;

claimed, vehemently: 'I 'am the happiest&#xD;
mother in Israel!' I thought for a moment&#xD;
the captain himself struggled against the&#xD;
tears-that forced themselves into his 'eyes.--&#xD;
1' thought lions, tigers, rocks, must weep;&#xD;
but the captain gnashed his teeth savage-&#xD;

at least with the genius of,~poetry, 'to sing&#xD;

visions were beheld 'n'the nocturnal sky,,&#xD;
and many a man had seen fiery chariots and&#xD;
angelic warriors in the golden clouds of the&#xD;

were common among ,the warriors, and the&#xD;

" I have :seen the 'angel Metatron, in a-&#xD;

to his 'comrade Reuben, "Metatron holding&#xD;
a flaming sword over the head of the evil&#xD;
demon Semael. -'Destruction is nigh ,and&#xD;
vengeance approaches,' said Metraton, agd&#xD;
the host of-heaven re-echoed his words,'It&#xD;
Was not language but harmonious nielodies&#xD;

swung his fiery sword, the host of heaven,&#xD;
chanted sombre melodies and Semael fell,&#xD;
lower, lower, still lower,' till he fell into the'&#xD;
Dead Sea, and there he was drowned. 'Then&#xD;
the angelic host exclaimed, 'Thus, o fora&#xD;
all thine enemies shall perish,' and they&#xD;
shouted divine hymns, Which the Cherubiml.&#xD;
and-Siraphim re-echqed in powerful strains.&#xD;
Then Metatron   triumphanitly explained,&#xD;
Israel 'is free!  This is my vision. R eu-&#xD;

"MNetatr nds the angel-prince who stands&#xD;

CHAPTER XV.&#xD;

In the temple of Venus at Jerusalem, where&#xD;
we were before, Aspasia-sat alone.with Iph-&#xD;

"He will embrace another womnandtid&#xD;

noticing the signal began the morning song.&#xD;
They came with the' garments of the sacri-&#xD;

graveyard melodies while they dressed the&#xD;

where she- should spill her blood to make'&#xD;
atonement for the sacrilege.&#xD;
-Iphegine looked indifferently on the priest-&#xD;
esses and 'betrayed no emotion of fear.--&#xD;
Again the chief watchman struck the 'me-&#xD;
tallic bell 'ith his heavy hammer, five times&#xD;
he now sti-uck the bell. The' chorus of the-&#xD;
priests 'was heard from  the subterranean&#xD;
temple, towelcome the victim. The priest-&#xD;
esses pressed the red crown on the head of&#xD;
Iphegine, and 'formedinto procession. As-&#xD;
pasia opened the door and'called her guards&#xD;
to protect the sacred virgins'in the perform-&#xD;
ance of 'their duties. None, however, an-&#xD;
swered her summons, not a sound was heard&#xD;
from 'either apartment. Also the chorus of&#xD;
the priests waO heard no more.  " Treaehe&#xD;
ry!" shecried, furiously, "my guards have&#xD;
deserted me."&#xD;
Now a host of Syrian soldiers emerged&#xD;
from the subterranean apartment and; quick&#xD;
as lightning, they tied, bandaged-and gagged&#xD;
Aspasia and' every priestess,'threw  a wide&#xD;
black robearound Iphegine and carried her&#xD;
off. In the tumult; however, she recognized&#xD;
Jonathan, and cried, vehemently, his name;&#xD;
but in vain; she was dragged away,,and com-&#xD;
manded to be silent.&#xD;
Know   it, profligate, hellish woman,"&#xD;
Jonathan sai1 to'Aspasia, who laid helpless&#xD;
and trembling on the .floor, "thypriests lay&#xD;
slain in the temple, thy protectors are smit-&#xD;

could"cut thee into small- fragments and&#xD;

While Aspasia and her priestesses were&#xD;
laying in'a  'helpless condition, 'Jonathan&#xD;
and his comrades carrying ofi Iphegine, re-&#xD;
turned to 'the subterranean temple, where&#xD;

CHAPTER X VII.'&#xD;
CoNsTERNATIoT.&#xD;
Menelaus sat in his room silent. and alone&#xD;
with'his grief. lls visage was deadly pale,&#xD;
his eyes without luster or motion, his head&#xD;
dropped to his bosom, and his mouth closed.&#xD;
So he' sat allnight, afteko hehad bid farewel&#xD;
to his daughter. .To servant was admitted,&#xD;
the silence of the graveyard- reigned in the&#xD;
palace. Suddenly 'the afflicted man rose,&#xD;
and with a hollow voice he cried: "She is&#xD;
dead, her grief, her 'afflictions are ended;&#xD;
but mine,"-he struck his breast, "mine burp&#xD;
in this heart and consume the blood of life "&#xD;
After a long' pause he continued, "Shame&#xD;
on Menelaus whose only daughter fell a vic-&#xD;
tim to' the tyranny which he,'supports in or-&#xD;
der to bea higbpriest! Shame on human&#xD;
nature, the father sacrifices his own child to&#xD;
maintain his dignity.". Thus he quarreled&#xD;
with. uhise, when a servant entered and,&#xD;
after many bows and excuses, he announced&#xD;
Philarches, the governor of the city.&#xD;
"I congratulate you, my divine lord,"&#xD;
said 1'hilareches, "your child was rescued.&#xD;
She lives." '&#xD;
Menelaus had no words.- He wept and&#xD;
embraced Philarches who'told him, that 'he,&#xD;
this morning, went to the.temple of Venus&#xD;
to, witness the sacrifice as Apollonius had'&#xD;
conmanded, but on arriving there he found&#xD;
th priests and guards slain, the priestesses&#xD;
tied, bandaged and gagged and Iphegine&#xD;
was gon4. He narrated,.how .he released&#xD;
the priestesses, and Aspasia in a fit' of rage&#xD;
told im that Jonathan at the head of some&#xD;
fty Shiai soldiers 'broke into the temple&#xD;
,and rescued lpheg ne..&#xD;
Fenelaus coulk scarcely recover from his&#xD;
surpiseand joy; but Philarehes contained,&#xD;
"Aspig also tells me that our armyis d9-&#xD;
fe te an ,,Apolloniusjs deaq."'&#xD;
shilarches predicted," said Mene-&#xD;
;aus.   The proud man ran into his death&#xD;
notwithstandingthe cautioning voice of his&#xD;
frieds." a, i  e    .&#xD;
.d30:id' ionthan cpme into the city?"&#xD;
was. Air question of Philarelhes. "My di-&#xD;
vine lord, there myst be traitors in Jerusa-&#xD;
Ism, "and it is our dut  odsoe  hmN&#xD;

oQrtup~ and the swod must be applied to ae-&#xD;

&#xD;
FIRST OF&#xD;
At this instant the voice of Amram was&#xD;
heard in the lnti-chamber singing merrily:&#xD;
e       "I fear that woman's fiery eyes,&#xD;
I dread her look,'that keen1f vias&#xD;
With starry rays and sunny beams.&#xD;
Her words are sweet,,her kiss inspires&#xD;
The coward's breast with heaven's fires,&#xD;
The soul, the heart with rapture teems."&#xD;
".What means this?" Philarches asked.&#xD;
-"It is my fool," said Menelaus. "When&#xD;
Apollonius left the city the soldiers dragged&#xD;
him along. He returns just now from the&#xD;
camp. Let us'hear his reports."&#xD;
Amram was called. One arm bandaged,&#xD;
he entered.&#xD;
"Where wast thou, fool?" Menelaus ask-&#xD;
ed, harshly.&#xD;
"Where thou wast not," was the brief&#xD;
answer of Amram.    "First I was where I&#xD;
was dragged'to, then where I was sent, and.&#xD;
last where I was driven. I had little to eat,&#xD;
still less to drink, and no fun at all, 'When&#xD;
all run 1 run. fastest, and. so I came first."&#xD;
" You are wounded?" Philarches asked.&#xD;
"Yes," said the fool, " the dogs bit 'me.&#xD;
The dogs and black bullocks are sometimes&#xD;
possessed of evil demons. ;Ashmadai's-dogh&#xD;
did bite me. Sire, did ever a dog bite thee?"&#xD;
"Never," said. Philarches, smilingly;&#xD;
"but tell me who is Ashmadai?"&#xD;
"He is the prince of demons," said Am-&#xD;
ram, "half angel and half man. Like an-&#xD;
gels he is everywhere, rises to heaven and&#xD;
is immortal; and like manhe eats and drinks,&#xD;
sleeps and begets his ownkind. 'There is a&#xD;
mountain somewhere, where Ashmadai has&#xD;
his well of water, there he drinks. When&#xD;
done 'he rolls ,the heavy stone on-'the well&#xD;
and seals it  with his seal.- When Solomon,&#xD;
the wisest king, wanted to"build the temple&#xD;

sent .Benaiah, Joadinh's son to catch Ash-&#xD;
madai in order to learn the secret habitation&#xD;
of the worm Sharir "If Shamir touches a&#xD;

meant, then he, told himself as David said:' moment."&#xD;
" And wine makes glad the heart of man."  Menelaus in vain bid, him;silenqe, he&#xD;
Ashmadai the fool drank of the' wine, and wouldn't listen. He.continued narrating:&#xD;
when he was drunk he fell asleep. Then " Meanwhile Ashmadai swallowed king Sql.&#xD;
Benaiah took the holy chains and bound omen, and with one wing in heaven and the&#xD;
Ashmadai and brought him before king Sol- other.on earth he spit Solomon into a distant&#xD;
omon."                                 land, assuming himself the form of Solomon&#xD;

indignantly, " we do not wish to know all was apoor nan, he begged his bread and&#xD;
this."                                 fought his way back to Jerusalem. Arrive&#xD;
"I am a fool, that is true," said Amram, there he said so long and often, 'I was king&#xD;
" but Ashmadai also once was a fool. He of Jerusalem,' till the sages said, there must&#xD;

right hereafter. But Ashmadai "        fool not always says one sort. of folly. On&#xD;
"None wishes to hear thy story, fool," investigation they found that Ashmadai sat&#xD;
Menelaus interrupted.,                 on the throne of Israel' and the stranger&#xD;
"Still I wish to tell it," Anyram said, and was the genuine king Solomon. They drove&#xD;

kissing him he shew him the road."       "That Ashmadai had a large stomach&#xD;

" we do not wish to know any more."'   why he wept on seeing the merry wedding,&#xD;
"None wishes to know more than suffi- he said,'the man would not live one year&#xD;

&#xD;
claimed: "Fool didst thou see Apollonius&#xD;
dead?"&#xD;
"Nobody could see," said Amram, "there&#xD;
was darkness, confusion, horror, noise and&#xD;
delusion, fighting, shouting and cursing,&#xD;
groaning, moaning and snatching, when&#xD;
Ashmadai swallowed Apollonius as he did&#xD;
king, Solomon, and all ran away as I did.--&#xD;
Then Ashmadai spit out Apollonius, who&#xD;

" Then we are defeated!"  Philarches-&#xD;
exclaimed, " defeatedas I predicted."&#xD;

" Ashmadai swallowed 'Apollonius."&#xD;
"Understand, my: lord," said -Menelaus,&#xD;
" the fool imagines Jonathan to be Ashma-&#xD;
dai.'&#xD;
"And Aleymos-sent himto Jonathan with&#xD;
a letter of Iphegine! " he exclaimed.-&#xD;
&#xD;
Apollonius was so great, that the supposed&#xD;
treachery of .Alcymos,-the escape.of 'Iphe-&#xD;
gine,and thedisgraceful defeat of; the army&#xD;
was for the moment forgotten. They could&#xD;
scarcely hide their joy before one another.&#xD;
" I will keep Jerusalem quiet,"' said Phi-&#xD;
larches, "let this be my care. Let it be&#xD;
your dity, my divine lord, to inform  the&#xD;

was especially anxious to elicit mor infar-&#xD;

&#xD;
motion; but Amnram could not be induced to&#xD;
say much. lie said enoughto throw any&#xD;
amount of suspicion on Alcymos,. and then&#xD;
caine out joke and folly. When the morn-&#xD;
ing dawned the city began to fill with the&#xD;
fugitives from the battle-field., The brag-&#xD;
ging of the soldiers and'their lies;excepted,&#xD;
they confirmed fully the story of Aram.-&#xD;
The disastrous defeat and de'th of Apollo-&#xD;
nius by the hands of Judah Maccabee was&#xD;
certain. As much as $enelaus rejoiced ov-&#xD;
er this and the escapeoof his daughter, he&#xD;
was troubled with apprehensions,. the Mac-&#xD;
cabees might attack the city. The most ac-j&#xD;
tive preparations of defense, were made,&#xD;
messengers were sent to Seron, to the king,&#xD;
to the governors of the adjoining provinces,&#xD;
and nothing was spared to defend' the city..&#xD;
Meanwhile the 'age of Aspasia was bqund-&#xD;
less. None vexntured near her fearing to be&#xD;
made the ob ject of her furious anger. On,&#xD;
hearing-of the death of Apollonius fear in-&#xD;
creased ,her-furious rage to madness, and&#xD;
she accused every human being, of treache-&#xD;
ry against the king. in company of Phi-&#xD;
larcheswhom she had-alreadyenta ngled in,&#xD;
her diabolic net, she searched through the&#xD;
city to discover, the secret spot through&#xD;
which Jonathan entered'and leftthe city.--.&#xD;
Many an innocent head fell that day itt Jet&#xD;
rusalem being suspected of a knowledge of&#xD;
the.secret entry to the city; but, inyain, no-&#xD;
thing could be discovered. -When evening-&#xD;
approached and the' secret entry had not&#xD;
been discovered, consternation'seied'on the&#xD;
heads'of the city, no man was permitted to,&#xD;
sleep or lay down his arms. Menelaus and'&#xD;
Philarches spent the night in the forts, and&#xD;
Aspasia trembled at, her own. shadow,-&#xD;
Bands of Syrian soldiers patrolled the city&#xD;
all night,"the watches on the walls and tow-&#xD;
ers were doubled, still none felt secure.-&#xD;
The returning soldiers rthade such terrible&#xD;
reports of the' bravery and numbers of the&#xD;
patriots, that everybodytrembled-at the least&#xD;
signal from the watch-posts.&#xD;
Amrai was the only fearless man in the&#xD;
city, he i-ejoiced at the'sight of general con-&#xD;
sternation among hose who but a short time&#xD;
ago'cornedatithe patriots, lie dressed his&#xD;
wounds and 'reinambered with delighlt, when&#xD;

everybody believed an attirek was tobe made&#xD;

metallic olangcof arms, the signalahd coi&#xD;

fully through the city and friglitaed ov'ery&#xD;

set the house on fire as soon as the 'tacl&#xD;
upon the city would begin. Trembling with&#xD;
anxiety and agitation he waited fr'the mo-&#xD;
ment of certainty that the attack wal begun,&#xD;
when Aspasia reeled into the palace'&#xD;
right into the' room of Amnram.  "Whee'&#xD;
is your master, ye faithless dogs?" she'&amp;amp;i'&#xD;
ed, 'furiously, "Where is the highprii st?'I&#xD;
must see hiin forthwith."&#xD;
Amram could not answer immediately, for'&#xD;
to be discovered in this critical mnioient-&#xD;
was very dangerous. Seeing that she did&#xD;
.not recognize him instantly, he'gained his&#xD;
presence of 'mind, and assunied-a'visage so&#xD;
idiotic and inexpressive,,that i'o'ne could&#xD;
recognize him' Aspasia, with the voic6 of&#xD;
despair,thundered: "Will you i mmediately&#xD;
conduct nite to your master?"&#xD;
"Pst, my  ady, do not' crys6 'loud, that&#xD;
none hears thee," said Anir ,'and   will&#xD;
sing thee a new song; a nice, new and sweet&#xD;
song; a song of love ahd joy."'&#xD;
Aspasia lifted upher 'hand to strilt6 Ain&#xD;
ram nd'cried'frantically, "Tolls mthe&#xD;
yournmter-is-!" ' '             '   '&#xD;
Amram, apparently without noticing h&amp;amp;&#xD;
rage, danced imerrily and sang:&#xD;

There was so terrible a clang in Amram's&#xD;
melody and in the- idiotic. war of laughter&#xD;
with which he closed his song .and dance,&#xD;
that Aspasia, shuddered. Like the snake&#xD;
before the Indian juggler she stood terrified&#xD;
before the horrid man.  " Who is thy -mas&#xD;
tear?" she.asked, with;a trembling voice.&#xD;
'" everybody's master is also mine," said,&#xD;
Amram.    "Apollonius is with Pluto or Ju-&#xD;
piter and  am 'here., Wilt thou go to my.&#xD;
master, "tell me, and I will show thee the&#xD;
way."&#xD;
Eyery hair' on Aspasia's head .stood on&#xD;

Amram felt relieved. The noise and con-&#xD;
sternation meanwhile had considerably in-&#xD;
&#xD;
" My lord, the soldiers look sad," the ofi-&#xD;
eer continued, "and' assure me the, ease is'&#xD;
quite urgent, despatch is required. Hear&#xD;
them and judge then, whether this is the&#xD;
proper time for recreation."&#xD;
"We forced our way through the holes&#xD;
and strongholds of this diabolic country;"&#xD;
said Seron, yawning, "we' must have some&#xD;
rest. I have sent a messenger to Apolloni-&#xD;
us and cautioned him. - He will not fight till&#xD;
we arrive. We are in time."&#xD;
"The soldiers you should instantly hear&#xD;
are fugitives from the army of Apollonius,"&#xD;
said the dficer, "who is defeated and killed."&#xD;
This information did not fail to rouse Se-&#xD;
ron from his lethargy. He started from hi-&#xD;
seat and asked the officer: '" Did you 'hear&#xD;
right? Do you mean to say Apollonius is&#xD;
dead, and his army is defeatell?"  -&#xD;

ran shouting and juniping through the&#xD;

seized upon all, young and old, grave and&#xD;
frivolous. "What means all this, my son?"&#xD;
he asked aboy of '12to 13 years, who reeled&#xD;
into 'the garden breathless and excited.&#xD;

knew how he camel either into the'city or&#xD;

barred and -vigilantly guarded. On com-&#xD;
mand of the highpriest, Amram was usher-&#xD;
ed into his presence..&#xD;
"Where is. my daughter?"   Menelaus&#xD;
asked, with a powerful voice..&#xD;
Amram had assumed so idiotic a visage&#xD;
that none could suspect his genuine stupid-&#xD;
ity. He answered instantly: "She is where&#xD;
she should'not be, but l know not where she&#xD;
is, nor does Ashmadai know it."&#xD;
" Speak intelligible words," he command-&#xD;
ed, " knowest thou where my daughter is?"&#xD;
"I know where she is, but I know not&#xD;
exactly .the place," was the answer. " But&#xD;
what of a .place!  Achshaf also was a&#xD;
place."&#xD;
"Does she live?" was the next question.&#xD;
" No, she sighs andsweeps," the fool said.&#xD;
"Then she lives!" Menelaus joyfully ex-&#xD;
claimed. "The happy live, the hapless&#xD;
groan," said the fool; "I have seen it in&#xD;
Achshaf and all the way do*n to Jerusa-&#xD;
em."&#xD;
" What of Achshaf! tell m ee what thou&#xD;
knowest of my daughter," -Menelaus com-&#xD;
manded.&#xD;
"In Achshaf the people danced, sang anid&#xD;
made music, then they 'were kiled-" said&#xD;
Amram. "The- was 'Tpheine as-&amp;amp;shma-&#xD;
