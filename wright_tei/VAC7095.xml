One of them, the Saloon-keeper, is now a zealous Temperance man, being a man of full scope, whether for good or ill.-  This Book is printed in Numbers, to bring it within the reach of the  middling classes, for whom it is designed.   ENTERED, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1854, In the Clerk's Office of the District Court of Rhode-Island.   THE REVEILLE. CHAPTER     I. GOSSIP. Do you see that old brown house in the suburbs, with its mottled, mos- sy look and old -vindows? In the Autumn of -- , towards evening, as the sun, descending, flooded the Atlantic withruddyand golden light, a young woman took her way towards that house. Two gossips sat at a window near by, and observed her as she passed. Mrs. Dolly Sealove pushed up her spectacles, and jogging her friend, Miss Jenny Brown, said, "Well, I never see thattpoor creature pass, but it makes my heart ache.- Do look, Miss Jenny, and see what!a pretty creature she is; she always looks just so trim and neat. Captain Sealove's first mate wanted to have her, and said she was the trimmest, tightest-built little craft he ever gave chase to. Certainly, four years ago she was -as rich a beauty as you will come across. Her cheek was as hard and red as a ripe cling stone peach. Then her eye! the captain's first mate said, it had a spirit in it that would awe a regiment, and yet betimes as meek and soft as a May morn- ing. Most everybody was after her, Miss Jenny." "I suppose she took up with a crooked stick at last," said Miss Jenny, "for I never knew one of these beauties to make out well. Beauty is the last thing I should ever envy anybody; it's a poor fading flower." "Sure enough," said Mrs. Sealove, " as soon as the bloom is fairly out, it begins to fade, as one might say, and that is some comfort to us home- ly folks." "It's no particular comfort to me," said Miss Jenny, "I know 'tis only skin deep." "But this poor girl," said Mrs. Sealove, "had something more than beauty to boast of. A neater, smarter, more industrious creature, you won't find anywhere. She was always a good sort of religious girl, too; but as the Captain says, ' none of your dumpish sort.' I used to tell her it'was as lively as music to meet her, she was as chipper as a bird " "But do. tell who she married, this great wonder? Who did she pick up at last?" "Do Miss Jenny" said Mrs. Sealove, " wait till I can tell my story. .          &#xD;<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC7095-00000003"/> 4            THE REVEILLE: You're so much like my niece Bessie, who. always reads the end of a story before the beginning, because she can't wait to see how it will come out. But you know I never hurry; --the Captain says he has known me to be half a day telling a story, which the could have told in ten minutes; but I love to give all the particulars." "Then who was the first?" said Miss Jenny. "First and foremost." said Mrs. Sealove, "and the best spec of all, was Sim Scudder, a first-rate young man. I 'spect there was hardly a plank in the vessel but what had Mary Grove's name carved in it.--  He was just the one for her, and he set the world by her, but la me!-- Mary was n't the girl to be caught all at once. She liked him well, too, , but he never got a promise as long as he lived, for after courting her a long time, he died at sea. Dear me," said Mrs. Sealove, wiping away her . teqrs, " them cruel, cruel waves never swallowed up a kinder soul.!' "I don't think that much to her credit," said Miss Jenny, " to keep a young man a-waiting till he died, before she would say yes or no." "It's the only thing I ever had against her," said Mrs. Sealove, "but any  how, the next one was Will Wilkins; I never liked him, he was a gen-  teel rowdy. Old Wilkins got rich on speculation. His mother was  oceans prouder than a born ladyand she thought her son too high for Mary, ! so Mary thought herself too high for him, and there was an end of that.-- Then that crafty old Pharisee, Singleton, sent her a love letter, when he  was a widower. She laughed at it, sealed it up, and sent it back to him  flying, and he hates her for it to this day. The last that came was Jerry : Woodliffe. Now I cannot help liking Jerry, he's so kind-hearted, obliging and clever."                          , "I've seen him a while since, in church," said Miss Jenny, "and no- ai ticed him, a passable pleasant looking man." "But after all," observed Mrs. Sealove, "Mary had more spunk in her than Jerry. He's nobody's fool, but there are few men about who have  got the life and spirit of Mary. I said when he married her, 'there Jerry X needed just such a wife, she will be the making of him.' If anybody  will keep him straight, it will be her. You don't know how nicely they went to housekeeping, Miss Jenny. She had saved money from her busi- ness as dress maker, and everything was smart and nice. I used to watch him going to his work, as regular as the day came."  'And how long did that last,"said Miss Jenny. 'I wish I could find the man that would hold out as he began."  !"Very few such, Miss Jenny," said Mrs. Sealove. "But as I was saying, all went well, till one election day I sat watching the crowd as  they passed, my eye lighted on Jerryamong the thickest of them. I did'nt like his look at all. The next day I observed he went an hour later to his ! business, and in the evening I sat at the window till after dark, but did  not see him go home. Pretty soon, I missed him entirely; he passed no more to his work, and I missed him from church. I soon heard how it was  with him. They moved out of the neighborhood at first, and about i a year ago moved again into that old ihin where they now live. He has  ! 'I   OR, OUR MUSIC AT DAWN.  sunk down into a sot, and poor Mary supports herself and her children by her needle. So she moved back here among her old customers. But she seems to shun company, and wants to keep her troubles to herself." "What does she live with him for?" said Miss Jenny. "I have no pa- tience with a woman who lives with a drunkard. Where's all the great spirit you told me of?" "Poor thing," said Mrs. Sealove. "She has a desperate strong affection for her husband. I talked to her once about it. 'I1Mary,' said I,' Where's your spunk? I would'nt live with a man that made a beast of himself.' " "Mrs. Sealove, its a dreadful life to live. It is not living, it is dying daily; but if I forsake him, there is no chance of a hope for him." "Oh!" she exclaimed,wringing her hands, "'tis a killing thing to be a drunkard's wife. Ohi! How much the hard-hearted rumsellers make me sufferi in one day; but they must meet me and many a murdered victim at God's bar." Miss Jenny very charitably replied that, "if folks would be married, they must take the consequences; for her part, she would'nt trust a manl if he came to her with a pair of wings growing out of his shoulders.- But don't you hear the bell, Mrs. Sealove?" "Sure enough," said Mrs. Sealove, "let's have our tea, its no use waiting for the Captain any longer. What do you think of this new tern- perance movement, Miss Jenny?" said Mrs. Sealove, as she poured out her tea. "Me?" said Miss Jenny, "I don't approve of it, because I don't think it will come to anything. Why this lecturer is right out of the Baltimore groggeries. He steps too far at once,to become a lecturer all of a sudden." "You forget St. Paul, dear Miss Jenny," said Mrs. Scalove, "one day dragging the Christians to death, and the next day preaching the Gospel.- This man is a kind of temperance St. Paul." "Your biscuits are very nice, Mrs. Sealove," said Miss Jenny,--" where did you get this lovely butter? 'tis as sweet as a rose." "The Captain," said Mrs. Sealove, " is a very paiticular man when he is on shore, about eating, but I'm thinking more about the lecture we are going to hear, than my tea. I cannot help feeling as if Hawkins is born to do good." "I hope he will," responded Miss Jenny, " but I've seen so much fuss turn out nothing, I've no faith in a sudden great excitement. There was John Swift came out in the revival last winter, where is he now? He and a great many more like him had better never set out. Great cry and little wool, say I to all such things; but Tim Easton, who was six years coming out in religion, just look at him, he's as firm as a rock." "'Tisn't all as you say," said Mrs. Sealove, "for there's James Wisemalt came out last winter, and he holds on bravely. 'Tisn't all smoke, Miss Jenny. Everybody ai'nt led alike. Look in my window, there's an aloc the Captain brought me. It takes just a hundred years to bloom. And there's a monthly rose close by it, it bears its flowers every month. Shall I throw away the rosebush because it blooms quicker than the aloe? No, indeed, Miss Jenny. Do take another cup of tea, to make you keep awake  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7095-00000004"/> O1            THE REVEILLE: if the lecturer is not lively, but by what the Captain says there's no fear of that; he says that there's power with him, and he's called to the work, but we must hurry or not a seat shall we get, for every one is pressing to hear him." CHAPTER -    II.             : HAWKINS. The saffron tints that had mingled with the imperial depth of purple, rich as the flowing of a kingly robe over the western sky, had melted : into the grey of evening, as gradually, as gently as man's life shades offt into its solemn evening. The young moon's golden crescent was more and ; more visible in the increasing shade; spirits of love and grace mellowed the ; air with their balmy wings, as they hovered over the place where mercy, was about to work one of love's miracles through the agency of that wonder-I ful man, who, raised from the death of drunkenness, seemed endued with  supernatural power to break the cerements of moral corruption and rouse the i poor inebriate from moral death to a new and blessed life. Crowds went hurrying through the streets, till thronged densely was the large place of assembling. Every eye was watching for the lecturer; every ear was on  the alert to catch the first sound of his advancing footsteps. There is often i: a feeling of disappointment oI such occasions, for where expectation has been wound up to so high a pitch, imagination has such foreshadowing  that her bold ideal makes the real personages appear less than they really are. How often have we heard it remarked,-"He did not look as I ex- pected he would, he did not come up to my ideas." And again, "I liked him better the second time than the first." But it was not so here. Any  one who had the least clearness of perception, would see in Hawkins the a embodiment of his history and his movement. If there was something  that satisfied the mind in his appearance, what shall we say of his lecturing;t -what indeed, since no words can express the strength of a mental Her- cules. Go and hear him, and see how a natural orator transcends an arti- ficial one, as much as a living landscape surpasses the finest touches of a A Claude Lorraine. Go, and learn what mental strength can do, combined  with moral power. Go and hear Hawkins. At this time in all the freshness of his late resurrection. with the halo of his heaven-aided conquest over I himself fresh about him, we must fail to convey any adequate idea of the    OR, OUR M'SIC AT DA\WN.  effect of his presence upon an audience. Reclaimed drunllkards, who lad been sitting in the very shadow of death, looked up and blest the new light; their families restored to hope beheld with joy the heaven sent de- liverer. These scattered among the audience increased the interest. Here was the bravest of their leaders, one who had writhed under the spells of the enchanter himself, yet on him in his dungeon had fallen a ray of celestial courage, and he, breaking his master's chain, beards him in his darkest decl. In the vast audience that evening, were certain rumsellers and their friends, who came to sneer at the man they really dreaded, but they made no outward demonstration, all was still when Hawkins began, and he never lost the attention of his audience one moment through his lecture; he gave the history of his own life with a masterly power. A heaving wave of unusual sensation rolled over the audience when he brought be- fore them the great crisis of his deliverance; expressed in tears and a long and hearty cheer. At 'the close of the lecture, the lecturer descended to a table where the celebrated Washingtonian total abstinence pledge lay.- He then and there put his power to the proof in urging forward the audi- ence to sign the pledge. Some came forward signed and retired. Just at this time a man passed up the aisle. He was one of the unfortunate inebri- ates, then perfectly sober. When he reached the table Hawkins spoke to him with great kindness, sounding the depth of his impressions, and ex- plaining the nature of the act he was to perform. While he was thus el- gaged a female was seen coming out of one of the pews, and advancing up the aisle with a modest hesitating step, pausing at every pew door as if to gain strength to go forward. But as the man at the table prepared to sign the pledge, swift and light as a seabird skims the water, she passed on and in an instant was bending over him. as he signed his name.- Said Hawkins, "I never saw two such bright eyes as was then looking down upon him." As he finished signing his name, the wife covered her face with her hands and her sobs were heard all over the house,- as they went off together, and left the -house linked arm in arm. "There," said the lecturer to the audience, " there goes a man who will need your help, will you aid him??' "We will! we will!" was heard everywhere from the growing band of the Washingtonian temperance men. Among the audience no heart had more entirely responded to the sound of the sobs that sealed the reunion of Jerry and Mary Woodliffe, than our friend Mrs. Sea- love, who had shown the utmost animation, though unable to induce the recusant Miss Jenny to sympathize with her enthusiasm. After the lec- ture there were some who roundly swore that every inebriate who had signed the pledge would be drunk in a fortnight, and with these the wish was the father of the oath. But temperance men were full of cheer and rejoicing in the growth of their cause.  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7095-00000005"/>             *THE REVEILLE: CHAP T EF R    I I. FHENDS.               i Few were the words between the young couple as they left the hall and passed through the streets towards their humble home; sobs of strong feeling shook the deep bosom of the wife, and the husband pressed : the arm within his own, and with a subdued and broken voice confessed the past and asked forgiveness. To his vows of love in their wooing days . her young heart had deeply listened, but they did not move her inmost soul like these repenting words; there was an angel balminess in those broken tones, that ran like ointment poured forth, through every avenue of her stricken heart; she became full of confidence; she looked up, the very ' stars appeared like watchers and seemed to say "we will keep him." The inanimate objects around the houses and streets looked friendly; they v reached home and folund their children asleep. The newly restored father bending over' them, bathed their innocent faces with tears and kisses.- "There's no man in the world," said he, "that has got such a wife and children as I have, and yet how wicked I have been." Sweet sleep visited ; that family that. night, and the angel of temperance hovered over them i with healing in his wings. Exhausted by what had taken place the last i evening, Mary slept later than usual, but was awoke by the kind voice of iler e husband, "I would not call you before," said he, "for -I thought you W needed this quiet sleep."  Looking up, she discovered that instead of hurrying off for his morning's dram as usual, he had made the fire, dressed f? the children, and was preparing the breakfast. Jerry had been out of I work for a long time in consequence of his intemperance. "Mary," said he, - it you have been father and mother a long time, and it is but just that I i; should take my turn and do some of your work till I find employment.! The morning sunlight streamed cheerfully into the room, and Mary thought : that never did sun rise so pleasantly before. It was a poverty stricken i place they were in; their homely though clean bed and the children's : trundle bed, a few broken chairs which had suffered sadly in Jerry's { drunken brawls, and an old table included all the furniture. Yet some- :: how the ill-furnished room had lost its desolate look in Mary's eyes. . Mary now went about completing their simple arrangements for break- ii fast, while Jerry tended the baby. While thus employed a sweet smile L! played over her face amidst tears that would keep springing to her eyes, for! the winter had passed and the long sealed fountain of woman's love was i open again; that smile, always beautiful, seemed now like light from heaven;: I When all was ready, the family drew around the table.      ! "I feel so thankful," said Jerry, "I want to give thanks." "Father," I said he, " we bless Thee that we have seen this day. -Take the poor pro- E digal back into Thy favor, and bless wife and children, for Christ's sake.!   OR, OUR MUSIC AT DAWN.          9 They had but just eaten breakfast when two brother Washingitonians canme. The men were not only well to do in the conventional sense, of that phrase, but they did well. As they looked upon thal happy fallily, ' Does not this look well?"- said one to tlh e other, wiping his mxoistening eyes as he spoke, " does nlot this look well?" "Indeed it does," replied the other. ' But, Jerry," said he, l" we have come to talk with you; the friends mcanl to help you, if you will help yourself." "That I design to do," said Jerry. "No fear but he will," said Mary,-"Jerry was always steady till .run deluded him." "Do you, feel resolved to keep your pledge?" '"To be sure I do," said Jerry, "and is'nt there grace enough with God to keep a thousanld drunkards true to their pledge? The same that has saved John Hawkins is able to keep me. So I pray for help. God bless your hearts for thinking of poor me." "I told youll," said Mary, " he would raise us up friends." "Come down with us to the whallrf," said one of the gentlemen, "we have bought a horse and dray for you, and you will presently find plenty of business." "But how shall I pay you." "If you are ever able you can pay, if not it is no matter." So all three left the house in fine spirits. After Mary had set her room in order, she seated herself to work with as light a heart as in her girlish days, humming one of the temper- ance carols she ha:l1 heard the evening before. Now and then she wourld put down her work aind talke up her chubby b}aby who sat playing at hier feet, cover its little face with kisses, exclaiming, "you hav'nt got a drunken father now darling." t,4,r           Y"^    ) X ^^)3J  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7095-00000006"/> 10            THE REVEILLE: CHAPTER IV. NEW HOME. A few weeks had elapsed, and the two cronies again set at the window.-- Every onle knows that a window opening on a public street is a very suggestive spot. It answers h similar purpose with the iniister's notes or the traveller's memoranda. It suggests themes. It is curious to observe how the sight of one individual or another, will open difll'relit budgets of  scandal, all apparently equalhly racy to the speculators at the windows. Bt  Mrs. Sealove was of the more arniable order of gossips. Site rwa5sv(ry benevolent and chariLable in her remarks and ,onclusions. A number of passengers liad gone and been commentedl upon, when Mrs. Sealove eslpied a cart stopping oil the opposite side of the st:eet. "Who in the worll," said she " is mnoving into the nice, new tenetment on the opposite side?- There's Jerry Wcodliffb by the cart. Bless me, it can't be him1." "Oh, no," said -Miss Jenny. "I suppose he is employed to help." "'Then I shounld not be at all surplrised if it was his family moving in. I've marked him, Miss Jenny, ever since that night, busy all the thIee,  and as sober as a parson. If Hawkins lihas only been the means of saving Mary Woodlifki's husband, I should bless God thlat ever lie came to the city." "If it does but last," said Miss Jennly. "I want to see all these re-. formed drunkards omte year from this present time ; there will come a sift- ing before then." "Why, Miss Jenny," said Mrs. Sealove, "don't you want Jerry and the rest of the poor rec!: imed drunkards to hold out? For my part, I not onlly hope they wil  t  now they wil t kno w the ill. I have joined the Martha : Washington Society, and siic:e then, I hiave come full into the faith ; and  why in the name of natur' don't you join, Miss Jenny Brown, a'int we told : to 'be ready to every good way and work?'"             .' "Yes," said Miss Jetnny, ":and we are told to prove all things, and I cal- culate to prove this work before 1[ join the Society." "Well," said Mrs. Sealove, 'lookimga to see how other folks' lamps hold : out, we may forget to trim our own. Go on, 5Miss Jenny, the same One [i who led them to take the pledge, will help them to keep it. But lere e comes Jerry's youngest brother down street, with a basket; I will just shove 'e up the window, and ask him who is nmoving in yonder." Up went the  ; window, and Mrs. Sealove learned with great satisfaction, that it was indeed Jerry who had rented the tenement.  In the fullness of her heart she called in the lad. "Here," said sle, leading him to her pantry, i "we had boiled dinner to-day, and Capt. Sealove don't set much by it, ! he has had so much of that sort at sea, so its about all left. I know Mary has had no time to cook to-day and will be glad of it." With these' words she placed in the basket some excellent boiled beef and pork,. with   ORt, OUR MUSIC AT DAWN.

"I think,' said Miss Jenny, "1'Mary was rathller too quick to move out of her old house, it looks a little like pride, and it is not good .jidgm1llent either, that's mny opinion. "You are all in the wrong Miss Jenny," said Mrs. Soenlve. "I know Mary Woodliffe so well that I can tell all her feelings. 1\ary loves to be nice and smart, true enough, but site knows tlhat nothng keeps a man down like a shabby home, and he is ten times molre likely to feel well and do well in a decent tenement, than in a place lie is ashamned to put his head into. The Captain is no ways for folks getting places they know they cannot pay for.  But says t!hev had better pinch in anythng but their home. The Captain says all hands work better board a fine ship. I don't think rich men show their cruelty and hard hearts so much in any- thing as the enormous rents they impose on poor people for tenements they would not let their dogs live in. That tenement over there is new and neat, but it is nothing more than suitable for a working man." ' But if they had lived in the house a while loinrer. they might in time," said Miss Jenny, "' be able to save enough to buy a ho,'C. of their own." "iNot half so quick, Miss Jenny, in that old rutti i! he lived comfort- ably. I tell you Jerry will feel himself a Ian agi n, :n,d will work with twice the spunk, and if he staid there, folks would inot thiiik nmuch of himin, "or he of himself. Mary is very smart, and lhas good calcolatioll; :;he will find some way to make ends mneet. There, she is comllinig herself, and see if she won't give us a good reason." Mary came in to t!hank Mrs. Sealove for her present. "I am glad, Mary," said Mrs. Sealove, "you will have so good a home; now that's a nice tenement, and you are the one to keep it so. IIow tha:nkful you must be." "I hope I am," said Mary, "I want my husband to realize the benefit of lbeing temperate, aind I think there is nothing so likely to keep a mani steady as a pleasant home. Hlaving two good attics, I hlave engaged lodg- ers which will bring the rent down, so that it is little more thanm we paid for the old house." i Mrs. Sealove cast a glance at Miss Jenny, as mumch as to say, "you see Mary understands herself." "Very well, Mary," said she, "so that folks don't begi:n too large, so as to come out at the little end of the horn. I don't discourage poor people from being smart, though some folks think that anything is good enough for a poor working man." "I looked at it all round," said Mary, " and made my calculations pretty close before I made the move. Nor did I do it without asking wisdomin from above, anti taking council from good friends. I feel I have acted for the best. There's a good temperance sister, a tailoress, will give me steady work. Jerry has constant employ. The friends have helped us to many little articles of furniture. We were as bare as if we had been burnt out.

But the Washingtonians, with Hawkins at their  head, are a grand fire company and the great Temperance engine called tie Washingtonian Total Abstinence Pledge, will quench the fire, even if it was ftd from the pit." "Well done for you Mary Woodliffe," said Mrs. Sealove, "you've  spoke the truth; you would make a good lecturer. But, Mary, dear, you re-  member you sold your best china that your grand-father gave you, to buy  bread for your children? I took the china just to keep the things out of Jerry's way, and that you might not feel beholden. I've kept them for you, hoping some day would come when you might safely have them." "You're too kind," said Mary, "let me do some little good turn for you, when you need assistance; I must go, for I have left everything at sixes and sevens to colle and thank you."  "Really," said Miss Jenny, after Mary had gone, " that's a very comely agreeable person; but I don't think such petting up the wives and fami- lies of these reformed drunkards, (as if they had done some great public ser- vice,) shows good judgment. It only encourages drunkenness." "Why Miss Jenny," said Mrs. Sealove, "don't you remember they killed the fatted calf for the prodigal son when he returned. And don't you re- member too, how the father rebuked the elder brother for finding fault; it is right to do for 'em; and Miss Jenny, you go right into the work your- self, and you will feel a great deal better towards it." "Don't try to persuade me against my will," said Miss Jenny, "you know that course only sets one against a thing." Mrs. Sealove finding Miss Jenny immoveable, changed the subject, and they fell into their usual round of conversation. C. 6 ' 2 "D"bt   :I        OR, OUR MUSIC AT DAWN.          13 CHAPTER V. CONSPIRACY. It was a dark, rainy afternoon, and business rather flagging, when a con- clave met in the counting room of a wealthy rumseller in the city. It would have been a good study for Hogarth, to mark the features of that group as they drew around the stove. There was the owner of the store,  a large, thick-set man. He was one of those men, who though selfish, yet ' having a certain show pt generosity, spending profusely what they acquire -  unjustly, are consequently well spoken of by superficial observers as large-hearted men. He had business talent, and having disposed of his conscience, it was so easy for him to make money that he spent it carelessly. Thus the selfishness of this rum dealer was to be tested, not by the lavish tray in which he spent or gave away money, but by Iis unscrupulous choice r of the road to wealth, and the close grasp with which lie clutched the keys of forbidden avenues to riches. You might call upon him to aid a charitable or religious work, and provided it did not interfere with his interest lhe would hand you out fifty or a hundred dollars, easier than sonie men would one. What a large-hearted man!" says one. "What a generous spirit!" says another. Yet at that very time his porter's cart might be distributing out to numbers of the genteel and vulgar tippling shops, those streams of liquid fire that are drying up the warm young lifit of the land. Would the wail of widows and the tears of perishing orphans deter this very be- Icvolent person from pursuing his pernicious business? No, he woulld be l ierftctly invulnerable. Touch the liquor business, and you would at once  discover the extreme sensitiveness of his selfishness. But his brothers of the trade looked up to him; they admired his money making tact, and ! the fame for generosity he had acquired, gave respectability to rumselling, l and now in their trouble they sought him. Beside him sat a rough, tall, dark man, whom we will call Rockhcart. There was not a soft line in ' his face; he had a look of sullen determination that might have befitted : the ruffian captain of a band of robbers. Next to him sat a singular look- ing person. He wore a forced, complacent smile, that seemed carved into his face. He had a supple manner, though really a very decided person. He had a slippery, double-tongued plausibility about him. Such was , : Ned Singleton. Beside him sat a young man, Iarry Wood, who had just set up a fashionable establishment. He was a very calculating fel- low, whose very life was money. He had acquired a moveable polish in I his exterior to serve his turn which he put on and off as readily as his gloves; orny he seemed most natural when it was off, but yet he much wished i to be thought a genteel rumseller.  The rum  dealers called him promising, and chuckling said, "Hal was up to anything." Jim Ready was :,i  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7095-00000008"/> "            THE REVEILLE:  one of the set. l-Ie was a person of daring energy united with perfect recklessness. His keen black eye flashed fire as he spoke of the new move- ment. He was for ofl-hand measures, nmobs, fires, &amp;c. Beside hiln sat one of the greatest monied curiosities in time group, Deacon Stillworm, a devout runlseller. The Deacon was one of thtose unlfortunate souls wh\Alo are making the difficult experiment of trying to serve God Cand malliton.- He had so much covetousness he could llot let go his unjust gains, and just enough conscience to make him terribly uleaSy,. He -,ave away some in charity ; not so mucli for a name as to appease his restless conscience, crying day and night against him. He had a hard titne of it, but hle felt easier to see how bravely these men carried it, who were as guillty as hinl- self. "It will rain to-night," said Ready, " themn Washingtonians will get enough water." "But it won't stop the people from going,"' said Stronghead, " they go as if they were mad. 1 never saw folks so carried away as they are with that fellow, Hawkins." "I was speaking to brother Moreland to-day about this thng," said thei Deacon. "He thinks as I do, that this movement will break lup the c}lttrclh- es, or make great divisions, and it ought to be put downtl o1n that acc.)itn!t it' no otier. I am afraid this kind of excitement will be th-le deathl of, all re- ligion, and all revivals will be put an end to. It is really dretadful t tli:lk of." "To be sure it is," said Hal Wood-a person no doubt lar{.,ly ilterested in these things--"But what is to be done? Stronghead is the genius, we all depend upon his wit and judgment." "Poll!" said Stronghead, " 1 want you to tell yovr plans first, anld then I will tell you mnine." ( If you want to'know what I would do," saidl Jim Ready, giving his hat a fierce twist and striding about the room as lie spoke. "I would mob  every temlperance meeting tlhey got up, give Hawkins a drang omut and a coat of tar and feathers, and ride himn on a rail out of the city." r? "' Whew," said Stronghead, " that's easier said than done." "No it ain't neither," said the rowdy. "I ought to know about low i easy it is to get up a row. I've been in enough of them. I don't preteld to nothitng like religion, but I think it's all-fired hard when such a ,(good christian as everybody knows Deacon Stillwormn is, cannot follow his own" business without the interference of these meddling rascals. My business- in the liquor way, is a small one compared to his, but I calculate they s!hall know who Jim Ready is before it is over. I'm for mobs, and I sliould like nothing better than to blow them up with gunpowder." "It won't do to be so much above board," said Singleton, "the Feople'  are too much in for the movement. I've been sounding romud. Some of' tlhe temperaince men think I am one of them." At this a strange sort of  laugh issued from him.. "But it's all a stratagem, just to get an insight of the  enemy's camp.  Hlowever, I'm ready for whatever is agreed upon as the best counter movement.1" "And so am I," said Rockheart, " though the temperance folks have not- [t   o0i, OUR MUSIC AT DAWN. lessened my clstonm nm{Ich.

I'll tell you who I should like to experiment upon,- that Jerry Woodliffe, whom Hawkins took into his church, the other day, with shch a parade; but he will be a hard one, he has got such an Arrgues of a wife to guard him." "Yes. she's wide awake," said Jim, "she is a confounded clever woman though ; she watched with my old an rl when he was a-g oingl, many a night, but she's no better than other women who have drunken husbands. If the rest say Jerry, so say I." "Try' Will Riverly first," said Henry Wood, "we shall get him mucl sooner." "Who, Widow Riverly's son?" said the Deacon, '; she is a sister in our church ; I think that will not do." "At this rate," said Stronghead, u" we shall never do anytling, for every- one named will be sister somebody, or somebody's son. I have an own sister's son, who is one of these reformed ilnebriates, and I hlad as lief he should be the first as anybody else, because I know the love of liquor is in him, and it will out some time or other, aniid iow is as goo0d a time for hii to return to his cups as a week hence. ntd thl i )'longer he holds oil the lhard- er he will go in for it when he has li;s nlext slree ; but my idea is, not to select out any particular olle, but ally o!ne, and the first one that brings down a pigeon, shall have twenty dollars fi' m the comnpan)y." "Three cheers for Stronghead!" said Ready, " he is the fellow to do up the thing handsomely." "See, brother Singleton," said the Deacon,'looking out of the window, "there goes our minister with one of the lecturers; what do you thinklof that?" "It is not worth while to say," said Singleton, "' yet we think give some folks rope enough and they will hang the iselves." "Any minister that don't mind his own btlsiness, and that is, preach- ing the gospel, he ought to be burnt," said Ready. "Gentlemen," said Stronghead, "I am sorry to say that my watch tells me it is time to close the store, everything must be kept still, and we must be faithful to each other." And thus ended the secret conclave. *   ! 'H   I, ), OURl MUSIC AT DAWN.         17 CHAPT ER     VI. TEMPERANCE BITTERS. A few mornings after the session recorded in our last chapter, Singleton came up the street where Stronghead's store was situated. IIis ustlal sly and sneaking manner was more than ever evident in his gait and appear- ance; a manner always betraying his wish to screen what he was. Ile entered Stronghead's store, but finding a few customers there, lounged about till they were gone. 4'I have something lto tell you," said lie, as he followed Stronghead into the colunting-room, with his wonted stealthy step and stony smile, but there was a cunning malignity in his sleek face like that of a cat secure of her victim. "What's the best news " said Strongllead. Said Singleton, "I've put out a sign--Tcmperance Beer and Temper- ance Bitters-The Hawkins' men round our parts are pretty shy of me, but several from this way have bougtlt. Bill Handy was passing by, and as you said you had no objection, and lBill is a goold-natured, 7easy, soft creature, says I to him 'good morning, Mr. Hanldy, I am glad youl ha ve he- come a temperance mat, I believe in being tenmlerate il all tlilgs, .as tlhe Apostle says." . "But," says Bil, " they do say you sell rum sometimes." "Says I, you must not believe half you lhear--people envy me because I know how to take care of my money better than my neighbors." "Do you see my new sign, Mr. Handy, says l--'l'emperance Beer, and Temperance Bitters?"  ': Are they true blue bona fide temperance?" says he. "Oh, yes, says I," " your uncle's minister has just been in and bought." "Mighty great proof this was of their being genuine. But Hlandy is one of theln sort that is satisfied if a minister uses a thing. The minister : had bought some, but I keep two sorts." "Here," said I, " taste for yourself:" "He tested, boughit a bottle, and I am sure of ]him." - Yes, you well may be," said Stronghead, ( for he has a strong appe- tite for drink. He is my own sister's son, and I had as lief it had been somebody else, Singleton." "But you did it to serve the cause you know," said Singleton, "you said yourself you were as ready to tri him up as anyDody else." It was evident that Stronghead aftex, all was a little chagrined that the blow should be given so near home." "I know I said so," said Stronghead, "and I 'll stand to my word." "To be sure," said Singleton, "you are a nlan of your word, and I be- lieve it was your own gene1rorus proposal that the first one who Iroulglit  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7095-00000010"/> 18            THE RI VEILLE: down one of these reformers, should have twenty dollars from the company, as you called us." "Hc is not down yet,"' said Stronghead. "Nor ever shall be if I can help it,' said Jerry Woodliffe, who had overheard part of the conversation. Jerry being in waiting with his dray for a load, was standitng close by Stronghead's store door. The door was open and the counting-room door ajar. Jerry hearing Singleton's voice, and knowing him of old, thought it no harm to stand near enough to gather a few of the pearls that dropped from the worthies' mouths. He knew where Bill worked, and went directly there and called him out. "Bill," said he, "have you bought any of Singleton's bitters?" "Yes," said Bill. Then bring the bottle and empty it into this gutter; why, man alive, the trap was set, and you would have been caught, if God had not sent me along there, in range of Stronghead's store." "But Singleton would n't cheat at fellow," said Handy, " he says he's as much for temperance as anybody. He's a member of the meeting, and talks like a good man. MTay be you are suspicious." "Just hear then," said Jerry, "I heard him with these ears bragging to Stronghlead that he had given you'the bait, and that you was as good as gone ; and wlat's more, lie claimed pay of the rumsellers for his dirty work." "Why," said Bill, scratchng his head and looking puzzled, "Stronghead is my own I{icCle.' "I can't lhelp that,"7 said Jerry, " 'tis all true what I say. A pretty fine, fatherly uncle that, for a sister's son.'7 "Jerry, thlnk yoll, and if Singleton and Stronghead both don't get a blowing-up from manrn, cross off Bill Handy from your books." - So saying, Bill brought forth the bottle and dashed it into the gutter. "Since you have escaped," said Jerry, '"I would not be wrathy, only it does me good to see that stuff dye the gutter as it rolls along." "Yes," said Handy, "L three cheers for the Washingtonian Temperance men, and ninety-nine for Hawkins." "I'll bet," said Bill, it was a bottle of this self-sarml stuff I saw Will Riverly a few moments ago, carrying along. He works close by, and I'll go riglit off and tell hint the ups and downs of this 'ere stuff." Off they went, and Will Riverly's bottle soon went the way of Handy's. The news flew, and before the next morning, placard and newspaper warned the Washingtolliaus to beware of the Temperance Beer and Bitters vetidedl at such a nititiber. But to return to the two evil-minded ones whom we left in Stronghead's store. Singleton little thinking he had been heard, went home chuckling over his scheme and licling his lips at the thought of the twenty dollars ready to descend upon hilm. "Who'se been here since I've been gone?" said he to his wife when he arrived.  f             ,   ORT, OUR MUSIC AT OAWNX          !9 Now this Mrs. Singleton was a very thumble slave itn tie: prlcsence of Il(,r lrusband, who had married his house-maid for his second wife onl plirpose to secure her vassalage. She mentioned among others Will Riverly. "Did you show him the temperance bitters, anlld wlichl sort " "I slowed him the dark colored and lie boughlt a bottle." G "Good " said Singleton,. And Mrs. Woodliffe hlas been in here, and I aske her to take a bottle ' as youl told me to do when she came for her yeast.7" "What did she say?  ' She said no, all she wanted was water, and her husb)anld was a teetotal- ler, she thanked God. So she bought hier yeast and Wellt off.:" She is mighty much,7' said Singleton; 7. It is not long since her hus- - band was in the gutter and it, will not be long before he'll be there again."' "I hope not," said Mrs. Singleton, "I donlt wish anybody that harm.1' Tils was very bold' in tie liege. So ler huslband put in with a frownl, told her to hlold her foolish tongue and mind her blllsinels, or lie would k1now why. So she returned to her old silelce and seated herself behind the counter to await customers. Her lotrd going into the back parlor threw himself into the arm chair -to read the daily paper. His features soon set- tled down into that perpetual smile, the like of which Shakspeare must have had in mind when he said, " a man may smile, and smile and be a villian." Tea time at length came and the tea kettle sung over the stove. The hot cakes and broiled bacon steamned up savoury on the table. Mr. Singleton said grace and seated himself to roll his sin as a sweet morsel under his tongue. Mrs. Singleton humbly ventulred an enquiry as she poured out the tea.     + " "Are you going to mecting to-night Mr. Singleton.', "Why do you ask such a silly question, yout know I always go. I ex- pect Pat Wilder may bring three or four empty demijohns; fill them up from the barrel in the cellar. If Bill Handy or Will Riverly or Jtake White come in for a bite or to get an oyster supper, get off some more bottles of bitters. Oh here comes Deacon Stillworm." Down settled the imperturbable smile as lie rose to open the door. "Going to meeting this evening? "Yes, brother Singleton, but I really do not talke the comfort I used to in going," Said the Deacon seating limself lazily in the arm chair, for lie had eaten a full supper. By the way full stuppers and dull conference meetings are more connect- ed than some of the brethren think. "Since we saw our minister arm in arm with that Hecturer, when we were over to Stronghead's, I have had no peace in lny mind, at all. This temperance will make an awful split in the churches k Old Deacon Olden says he remembers the time when he went to fishni}g parties with millisters and church members and they thought as mutch of taking their mlm rbottle as their fishing tackle, and I think they had as much religion then as they have now." "And more," said Singleton. "Yes more," responded the deacon. 1          }  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7095-00000011"/> 20            THE 'REVEILE : "How is your wife as to these things," said he, (as Mrs. Singleton step- ped out of the room to get a clean platter and cup and saucer, preliminary to her husband's asking the Deacon to take a seat at the supper table.) / "' She knows her place too well to think anything about it, I've trained Nabby, Deacon." "I wish you would give me a leaf out of your book," said his friend, " my wife is going over to the these folks as fast as she can." By this time Mrs. Singleton returned with that meeching look which her husband's iron sway had imprinted on hei face. She resumed her seat at the table, silently putting the platter, &amp;c., in their places. "Will you take some sup}Ier?" said Singleton. "Well I don't care if I take a cup of your good tea. It will kind of settle my stomach, for I have eaten a great supper," replied the deacon. Seated at the table, he said to Singleton in an under tone, "Any of the Washy's got caught yet." "No," says Singleton, " but there is a trap laid that will fix some of 'em." "But this matter about our minister," said the deacon, is a dreadful bad thing; some of the heaviest men in our corporation are wholesale liquor dealers and wine mrerchants-dreadfl bad tiling for the church, added he, shakilg his head. Having dispatched their supper the two left for meeting. CHAPTER VII. AUNT HANDY. But Bill Handy's Ma'rm was sitting at her window watching fof the two worthies who had to pass her house An their way to church. Ma'rm Handy was a full blooded healthy dame, with all the independence which constant health and strength give to the possesor. She had strong feelings; her Bill was an only son, and his drunken habits had given her much trouble. Hawkins had been the means of his reform, andshe had re- joiced therein with all the joy of a mother. When Bill had returned home after the affair of the bitters, his heart was full, and as he and his mother sat down to dinner; Mother said he, I sup- pose you've thought Uncle Nick Stronghead was a friend to you? t Why you know he never did no great for me; he'd rather give where it would make a great sound, but I don't suppose he's my enemy. "Well," said Bill " he'd see us to bungee before he'd give up rumselling; but I'll tell you all about it." Bill then emptied his budget. Marmn's cheeks glowed more and more as Bilk told his story.   OR, OUR MrSIC AT IAWN.         21 When done she doubled 'her fist and struck it downi on the table, "if I don't (ive Singleton a blessing to-night. as he sneaks down to nieeting, tlhel my name is not Jemima Handy; ant old screw mouthed hypocrite ; and as to brother Nick, just as soon as I clear away dinner, I'm going right over to his store to give him a piece of my mind. I'n poor, and he is rich; but 'I'll make him quake"in his old shoes. Your Uncle Nick, a'int the Almighty, V if he is the king of the rumsellers." ; Now Ma'rm," said Bill, "I'll tell you the best way, just write to him,l for you will never get a chance to see him in his store." "'1'enl bring me a pen and ink, Bill, and let me write now while I feel spunky." 1la'rm Handy's letter to her worthy brother, was on this wise: "Brother Nick: So you have been plotting with that old snake Singleton against may p)or boy, xyho is all one as a brand plucked fionl the bullrling! Is that your kindness to your own widowed sister's son? You have got a great name for generosity; is this a salmple of it? (1O, Nick, you have for- got the old days on the farm, when you was poor and honest! You loved me then. You'd have sooner cut off your right hand thlan 1doii this.- , Who'd have thought it was in you ; but true enough we don't know a manll till he is tried. And then that Singleton, Mr. Stronghead, time was w1en you would'nt have looked at such a whining rascal; but I've seen it and and been sorry for it. You've been running down from the man you was ever since you went into the rum business. I will tell you the truth now you have roused me up to it. I shall not miss what you have done for me Nick; there's more wasted at your table in one day than you ever give me, though I desire to be thankful for what you have done; but all the gold in your strong box would not shut my mouth now. You've touched the apple - of my eye. You thought because I was poor, I had no feelings, and it was no matter whether my Bill was a man or a beast; but by God's help and his good friends, his head is above water yet, and there it will keep, please God, for all you or old Singleton, or your great dragon rum that swal- lows up men alive. This comes hoping that I may never see your face till ! you know what belongs to a brother. i -. Your loving sister, JEMMA HANDY." I  Bill pronounced the letter first rate, wiped his mouth, put on his hat and : wenlt to his work ; chuckling at the thought that he had a mother that was up to a thing or two.  "I tell you," said he as he met Jerry going to work ; "The old woman's up, -Singleton will find that bottle of bitters a bitter dose for himr." 4  Such then was the state of things when the unsuspecting, Singleton ,along with the Deacon took his way through the street that led past Mrs. Hand y's. She threw up the window as they drew near, her face glowing red as the crimson calico dress she wore. :, "Singleton," said she, "have you got any more of that beer, or those A bitters that you sold my Bill?" "A few more bottles left, sister Haudy," said Singleton.  :iij  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7095-00000012"/>             T'reVTHE iREVI:fl C  Sibter Handy, indeed,"' said she. Well if you don't go right hoImre and throw every one of them bottles behind your back-log, I'lI come rignh into meeting to-night, as sure as my name is Jemima Handy and open my case before them all." Sister," Singleton began in his most obsequious manner. ', Sister me no more till you go home and break them bottles or you shall hear from me this nigt." "Do speak lower, Mrs. Handy," said the Deacon, 1" people will hear you as they pass along the street." "That's the very thing, I'm after, I want the folks to know' your tricks:' pretty business you are illn for a professor, cheating men out of their souls." "Come," said the Deacon, "I eannot have you so hard one brother Sin-  gleton, somebody has palmed these bitters upon him for temperance bitters." That's no go," said Ma'rm Handy, " somebody overheard him bragging ' that he had trapped my poor son, just plucked out of your rumt den. Deacon Stillworm.,  (I would'nt listen to eaves-droppers,' said the Deacon., "Nor I to rumsellers," said the lady. "Come, Brother Singleton," said Deacon Stillwormr " we shall be late, there is no use standing here to be abused in this manner, see what a crowd is collecting, we shall never hear the last of it." i"No, you shall never hear the last of that bottle of bitters," said sheC 'I'll ring that in your ears as long as you live, how you laid a bait to over- throw them that were trying to get clear of you and your rum, how you was to have so m1uch C Here Singleton seeing that she knew what was dangerous for others to hear, stepped up to the window and said: "Say no more, Mrs. Handy, and. I will go home and do as you wish be- fore meeting, only say no more." "Very well," said Ma'rm, "h but if I ever hear of your selling bitters again, you'll find it the worst work you ever put your dirty hands to, Sim  Singleton." So down she shut the window. To avoid' the people, drawn together by the bustle, Singleton and the Deacon stepped into a store hard by and waited till the bystanders dispersed. The two compeers then took a more obscure way to meeting, for Singleton had not the least thought of fulfilling his promise to Mrs. Handy. To avoid an exposure of his villany on the spot, .he determined to be more cau- tious than ever. l"This shows what the temperance business is doing," said Stillworm, "this is the way their converts talk. "That woman shows no more respect for me, the deacon of her church, than if I had been some street rowdy." "I had the worst of it," saiySingleton, I never was so beat in all my life, and I will find out her ii ormer and he shall pay well for his eaves- dropping. To be abused so/in the open street, and by a woman too, 'tis too bad." "Be calm, brother mngleton," said the Deacon, "remember where we, are going, you are most always just so, nothing seems to move you, but it V.   O1Z OUR MUSIC AT DAWN.           2J was enough to upset anybody, I'll allow that. I don't kovxw where th[at woman's christian spirit is." They now reached the vestry, and eiitered it in n'o very harmonious mood, but from old associations and long Ihabit, Siligleton's 1act assumled, soon after he took his scat, that sanctiimonious look ihe had so long wot i and he fell into that part he usually acted iii mtcing ias ;elicitolltsly as he had, done for twenty years. Singleton was a real actor, because hle ically dreamed he possessed the character he had so long assned. "This dissini- ulation whch hid his heart from others, as effectually veiled it fi'cin him- self, for men are prone to see themselves as they are in other's eyes. Hle had brought religion down to a level with his own seared conscience, and  believed it as corruplt, as himself. To look at llim tlhat evening, as lie sat in the conference room, the common observer might take the unruffled coin- iplacent tranquility of his countenance for that genuine peace " which they have who love His law.:" But not so witl the deacon, the worm in lhis bosom began to gnaw very keenly, and his countenance was di'sturbled. Meanwhile the bretheren and sisters came gathering in. Singleton tielt sure that Ma'rm Handy would not come, because her business ias of a kind that occupied her much evenings during the week, and she was one of thlose honest sort of people who are most ready to believe other people's p)rolises, ; and he had pacified her with a promise lie never meant to keep. So lie sat quietly, as the rest came in. Presently tie minister entered; a main in whoso i face meekness and resolution were mingled with such harmony as in that of : the ancient leader of Israel. -He took his place, anld, after a pause, arL(so and opened the mneeting with that impressive conference hymn, "A chargo to keep I have." He appeared to feel te., words most deeplly. Wheun lie prayed he prayed; no mouthing with him, all was sweet earnest devotion. : He seemed to have the power given him to draw the audience into ,prayer with him. But there was one petition which made some sensation in the vestry, it was this i "Lord bless and guide the good work lately begun in our midst. Restore thou through its eficacy the poor deluded drunkard : to his fellow-men and to thyself." Singleton and the Deacon were on their knees in the same seat, and each simultaneously removed their hands from their eyes and cast a side look at each other, as much as to say, " you see the infection Ihas taken deep hold," When the minister ceased, these men could contain themselves no longer.-Deacon Stiltworm, in his own opiniont and in the estimation of some others, had a good gift in speaking. After a few of his usual com- mon-places, he thus proceeded: "My brethren, I like this old-fashioned religion, for my part I want noth- ing better, I want no additions. The Evil One will always be contriving something to draw off our attention. We must beware of him. He don't care what it is, politics, temperance, peace, anti-slavery or anything, that will take off our minds from real religion. We must lay aside every weight, and these are all a dead weight upon us.' Dear brethren and sisters, be not carried away with every wind of these new doctrines, nor with the vain : wrangling of men of corrupt minds, who are subverting whole houses, that rmeans whole churches, for filthy lucre's sake. If' you have itching ear s I   &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7095-00000013"/> '24           T"E REVEII,ILE: for these lnew doctrines, yoll will lose yolr religion before you a ar ware."' lie thell sat down. -Singleton next arose with his hyDceritical manner and lifeless smile,- l; Brethren and sisters," said he, " thlere could be nothing better nor mnore to the purpose, than what the brother 1hs said who has just sat down; But I felt just as if I wanted to say one word about peace and unity. The Apostle says, ' mark them that caute divisons among you'; our bulsiness is to convert souls-not to sow divisions, by touching lu!on0 t11iligs witl wlich the church has nothing to do.' I desire to be thankful, my brethren and sisters. I am the same I ever was. I desire not to listen to tale learers, and give heed to false apostles, but to hold to the things that make for ;eace." I-e. sat down, and the Deacon sang a verse,-"Let thy kingdom, &amp;c."- And directly afterwards, Mr. Mildmay, thie minister arose, with that soit of light and glow about his face, which it wore when his whlole soul was all alive and in motion. "As the brethren," said he, " have opened the way for me, I feel that our meeting will not be profitable, dlless I candidly open my mind to you. I am not conscious of bringing any extraneous matter into tjis friendly christian conference, if I mention in prayer or touch in exhortation upon that subject which the holy apostle of the Gentiles made one of the three great themes of his discourse to Felix, the Governor, reasoning onl Right- eoustless, temperance, and a judgment to come. See how important the subject, by noticing with what momentous matter it is classed. A large and increasing number of our fellow men are in the danlgerous thraldolm of drunkenness ; and another far more guilty class are living by the gain they get in leading these poor men to ruin. Is not the true work of a minister, saving souls fron death-and who are in greater dailger thlla thcae I have -mentioned? God has sent hither a wonderfil apostle of Temperance, and said to him, "I have much people in this city." Shall we not lend him a helping hand in the work? 1 am always happy to hear my brethren and sisters tell what God has (one for their souls, and I wh tell you what he lhas been doing for mine of late. I have had a greater insight into this mighty evil. It is intemperance that thins our churches and throngs our taverns. It is intemperance that destroys our seamen and wreck our vessels. It desolates our homes and peoples our grave yards. War, Famine, and Pestilence have been called the three great destroyers, but intemperance is more fatal tlhan these. These slay the the body-intemperance reaches to the soul' My christian friends, let us rejoice that the public sentiment is awakening against this sin, knowing that it is the true wisdom of the church to be ready to every good way and work, let us, in the name of Jesus, go forward like good Samaritans, prepared to rescue onr fallen brethren. I believe so far from deadening our religion, such deeds of love and charity will give it life. Did it lessen the spiritual life of our Lord's discourses, bacause he stopped in his way to heal the outward ills of the veriest wretch on the highway? The same condescension that multiplied the bread, stoop- ed from heaven to save us! The same love in the church which goes forth to rescue the drucllikard, perfliues the prayer which ascends on high like   Oni, o1I NItstc AT DAWN.         25 I. v stVet incense." The minister then sat down. The meeting then proceeded after the usual manner, except that a very 'iodest, meek, saintly looking woman, whose face had worn a satisfied look through the meeting, arose and spoke thus;-- I desire to thank the dear Savior)" said she, "that my son who was lost is found, He was dead, but is alive again. I feel the truth of all our beloved minister has said, and ask his prayers, and those of you all, my friends, that God would keep my son from falling back into silnful ways.- He was coming here to-night to acknowledge all his backslidings, blt some- thing took place to-day which prevented it. A snare has been laid for him, but praise the Lord he has escaped." While sister Riverly thus addressed the audience, Singleton's heart felt the  sting of shame. Also in the deacon's bosom the worm began to gnaw most fearfully, As the people were going out, sister Riverly and Singleton en- countered one another. There was a deep expression in her usually mild eye as she said; ' Mr. Singleton, Christ raised the widow's son; can it be that you are seek- ing to destroy mine?" Singleton felt the rebuke, and slunk away. He left the church muttering il vengeance between his closed teeth against the informer, who had twice :i thwarted his diabolical purpose. The Deacon began with: !  "'Brother Mildmay is very imprudent; our corporation cannot help hear- ing of this." ": 'He's dished," said Singleton; I've watched him pretty close; he will t:? be rebuking rumselling from the pulpit next." ?4}- "He is between thirty and forty," said the Deacon; "and if he don't i! know which way his bread is buttered, let him keep on talking; let him  ride his hobby till it rides him out of the pulpit. I am all out of conceit of 'i him; my wife thinks he is great things, but I don't like him nigh so well ?i as our last minister." :  "He always kept liquor in his house," said Singleton, and I like him i the betterfor it." "Going home to break your bottles, brother Singleton?" "Not I, but what could I do with a crazy fury like Mrs. Handy?" "I thought you would not be such a fool; but what was it sister Lucy Riverly was saying to you." "The same eaves-dropper that told Handy told Will Riverly." i  Singleton did not dare to repeat the rebule,' the words of the wise are :   as goads." The two discomfited deceivers parted at Singleton's door. r', !.  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7095-00000014"/> 2tG           1THE REVF ILILE CIAPTER     VI. A PRBACHER OF RIGHTEOUSNESS. The Sabbath following the events of the last chapter, Singleton and thre Deacon were in their wonted places at church. Singleton's face again wore its coined smile, and the Deacon in his finely starched bosom and glossy broadcloth, looked as saintly as ever. He was also greatly strength- ened by the near vicinity of several rich rumocrats, whose fine lady wives and daughters, itn their rustling silk and smooth velvet, glittering with gems, engrossed a great amount of the conventional respectability of the congre- gation. The heads of the congregation were there too; terrible men in the well filled depths of their purses, and the determination of their will that the temperance reform should go down. Indeed the Deacon and Singleton well knew all the nabobs of the congregation were on their side and with them all the small fry of teadies and dependants, whose generous instincts ascertain on which side of the fence is the crib and the barnyard. The Deacon therefore buttoned up his coat, erected his head, felt strong, and forgot the gnawings of the undying worm, as he contemplated the worship- ful fellowship of sinners, about him. Even Singleton's face, under all its assumed meekness, had a certain whose-afraid look, the nearest approach to courage the man was capable of. In the rest of the congregation there seemed to be an unusual interest. People's eyes were often turned towards the door to watch when the minister would come in. But Mr. Mildmay entered in his wonted mannelr as if unconscious of the unusual excitement about him. He was not very sensitive in respect to the varying aspects in which men might regard him. To fulfil lis ministry, to accomplish his duty was his breath of life. No miser ever loved his money, no lover his mistress with the impassioned devotion, with which he loved his ministe- rial work:. le was clearly aware of the relation of true christianity to the present reformatory movements, and girded himself for the warfare with the deep love and firmness of a christian philanthropist. There was great waste of frowns and stern looks from the big men that morning. The individual theY were designed to influence was too much occupied to observe them.- Mr. Mifdunay's forenoon discourse, though not at all bearing on temperance, inculcated the duty of christian firmness from the text: 'Be ye steadfast, immoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord.' He very convinc- ingly ehowed that persecution must be the portion of the faithfil Christian, while the world continued as it is. That although modified by circum- stances there was the same persecuting spirit now on earth as in the days of the Savior and the Martyrs. That Cain wnold make war upon Abel, because his works were evil and his brother's righteous, to the end of the world.   OR, OUR MUSIC AT DAWN.           27 ' Let the man," lsaid lie " who is unprepared for continual conflict for- sake Christ's battle line, for he is not fit to go into the war which will never - end till Christ's conflicting battle with Death and Hell." i  The afternoon brought together a still more crowded house. The min- ister's text was, 'And now abideth Faith, Iope, Charity, but the greatest of these is Charity.' In discoursing on this lovely theme, he showed that Hope is the child of Faith, and Love springeth fronm both ; that Charity is tle climax. He then with beautiful distinctness, pictured that Love in all its workings; towards God in profound devotion; towards man in all benev- olence. To raise the fallen, to reclaim the wanderer, was her highest and andt favorite work. He then adverted to that work, which at that present time seemed pressingly to call out her heavenly energies. He pictured the poor betrayed drunkard, the man who fell among thieves, lying helpless by the way side, till temperance men, like the good Samaritan, should raise ilim and restore him t. society. It was curious to look over the church, : and see hdw differently his sermon affected different hearers. There was honest, buxom Ma'rm Handy, her dear son Bill at her side, as clean and neat as her strong and skilful hIlnds could make him. Surely the good minister had no small part of his reward in seeing the pleasure that beamed  in her countenance, softening her strongly marked features into beauty, and : also in the serious calm consciousness of a happy victory over himself, that lent unusual intelligence to the simple, hardy face of Bill Handy. Mr. Mildmay knew too, that it was his influence had induced that youth to sign the pledge, the cause of this happy result. Nor did the minister fail to , gather strength from the satisfied look of meek sister Riverly and her re- i- claimed son. Then there was our Mary Woodliffe, with her husband aid her neat little family. Mary's eager and animated attention to her beloved minister's discourse, showed that she realized the words of the Psalmist: 'Thy word were found and I did eat them, and they were unto me as tle rejoicing of my heart.' Both Jerry and Bill Handy, at certain points of tlhe t discourse glanced significantly at the I)eacon and Singleton, and then at  each other, enjoying the uneasiness of their foiled adversaries. Meantime,  the worldlings, who measure their effect upon others by their own estimate of themselves, their wealth and position, in their expression of face strongly :, contrasted with the other side. The worshipful members of the corporarion, who felt their covetousness touched to the quick, were full of wrath, and YO you could sec in their frowning brows and cloudy eyes, the storm gathering,  the incipient thunderbolt, hereafter to be hurled against the meek but faith- ful preacher. Singleton, as one of their base subordinates, watched the great ones to see if they shrunk from the text, and though the Word pierced him, he took courage from their big looks, and his characteristic smile, the s smooth cover of his villiany, that had waned away now rose to its wonted  show of complacency. The most disconcerted of all was the Deacon. i  Mrs. Stillworm, who was secretly converted to the temperance faith, and : was very faithful in reporting to her husband the growing prospect of a de- cline in the trade of souls, sat within her furs, at the head of her pew, i greedily drinking in the discourse, and reconoitering from the corner of her f.  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7095-00000015"/> 28            THE REVEILLE : eye, to see how it worked upon her Lord tie Deacon. She knew the sel- sitiveness of his conscience, and the stubbornness of his covetousness, and what harrasslng torment he had between them both, and she had all the instinctive sagacity of her sex to know just where to hit the sore place, and keep him uneasy under his sin. First, he rested on one arm, then on the other, pretended to doze, then shifted his seat. He "changed his place, but kept his pain." His wife watched his movements, and whenever she caught his eye, gave him a glance, as nmuch as to say, "Stillworm, I know very well what ails you. Grasping covetousness, and griping conscience, make burning work within you, and so I hope it will be till you give it up." Such was the bye play of looks in the congregation, while the preacher spoke directly on temperance. But whol can paint the surprise, the anger, and the various feelings expressd in different countenances when Mr. Mild- may, without the least change in his usual manner in giving out appoint- ments for the week, announced that there would be a temperance lecture from    on Monday evening in that house. These words were like a firebrand in the enemy's camp. There was great tossing of plumed heads, and turning away of scornful eyes, as the minister passed down to the lobby. There was great gathering around the church door, and venting off pent-up wrath, after he had passed down street. There was considerable sensation among the under ranks. Such men as Jim Ready, who came on purpose to scoff, and to be excited, swore roundly, but the little flock who had been well fed, passed along quietly to their homes, save that Ma'rm Handy as they went along, giving Mary Woodliffe a sound slap on the shoulder, exclaim- ed- "Did'nt he give it to 'cm, and looked all the time as if he did'nt." The enemy did not even let Sunday pass without action. As Mr. Mild- may, his wife and family, were at tea, Mr. Moreland, one of the leading members of the corporation, came in. After they had drawn back from the tea table, the following conversation ensued- Mr. Mildmay. "I thought it was a privilege accorded me when chosen your pastor, that I should use my own discretion in inviting persons to oc- cupy my pulpit?" Mr. Moreland. "Yes but we had confidence in you. We did not dream that you would desecrate the pulpit by admitting to the sacred desk any strolling adventurer, who might seek to disturb the peace of a community, by exciting the public mind on questions with which certainly the church has nothing to do." Mr. Milldmay. "Now, sir, I think very differently. I think the church has much to learn, much to repent of, much to do in relation to the matter." Mr. Moreland. "Yes, that was the drift of your discourse this afternoon, but I heard a plain common man observe as we came out of church,- he had rather hear a good gospel sermon." Mr. Mildmay. "And is not good will to men the gospel spirit, and is not that a gospel sermon which would seek and save the lost, and rebuke sin where it has entrenched itself in the strongholds of'wealth and power?" Mr. Morland. "I think a minister like St. Paul should know nothing but Jesus Christ, and him crucified."   Oil, OUR oMDUSIC AT DAWN.        29 Mr. Mildmay. "I acknowledge the love of Jesus to a lost world. is the point where all the rays of love that radiate through the universe diverge; but a fire proceeds from thence, also, which pervades everywhere; works against all sin in every form, and ;pursues it to its extermination. Sir, there are thousands of the victims of rum, to wlorn thie preachinsg of a Savior is worse than useless, and must ever be until they are brought from thie con- dition of beasts to feel as men." Mr. Morland. "But there were no slich chara:cters in churcl this after- noon. The audience appeared to me to be very respectable, as is usual at our church." Mr. Mildmay. "And who is the greatest offender, the drunkard or this betrayer; he that holds the cup to his neighbors lips, or he that is enticed?" i  Mr. Morland. "I see, sir, with rnmuch regret, how deeply tainted you are with this new fanaticism, and I'll tell you as a friend it wont do to take the course you have. Some of the most respectable men in the congrega- tion, indeed, some in the church, are engaged in the liquor business, and they will not put up with these things. They have forborne a great deal in  your case, far more than I thought they would ; but you have been very useful among us, your labors have been blest. The people generally like you, and, therefore, though frequently pained, we have refrained. -But to speak the truth, sir, their feelings were outraged this afternoon by the sermon and by the unwarrantable indignity of asking a strolling temperance lecturer in our church, that we could endure it no longer, and we must re- quest an entire forbearance on this sublject." Mr. Mildmay. "I am very sorry that in the discharge of my duty as a i minister, I should be so unfortunate as to offend any one. 1 sought to speak the truth in love, but in regard to the recalling the appointment for the Icc- ture, I cannot do that, because I should both offend my conscience and de- base my standing as a minister of Christ." Mr. Moreland. "Then, sir, I am to understand that you positively de- I  I dine to do as we wish?" Mr. Mildmay. "Yes sir, I do." i  Mr. Moreland. Then, sir, I am authorized to request you to attend a meeting of the corporation to-morrow at 9 o'clock, to consider these extra- ordinary things, and we request you to mention the meeting after your even- e ing lecture." Mr. Mildmay. "I will do so with pleasure." Mr. Moreland. "Good evening, Mr. Mildmay." The church was thronged that evening, partly from the report of th af- ternoon's events. Mr. Mildmay's lecture was:--"And as he reasoned of t  righteousness, temperance and a judgment to come, --Felix, trembled." He described with great vividness, Felix as the representative of a large class of men. He showed the difference between the men of whom the prophet , speaks, who are of a contrite spirit, and who tremble at the word of the Lord, and the trembling Felix. "Their's," he said "was the trembling of I  awe struck penitence, while Felix trembled from the trepidation of con- scious guilt. Their's was from an humbling view of their own unworthy- ! ness, the other from the guilty fear of the terrors of the Lord." He exhib- i/  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7095-00000016"/> ited the dangerous timidity of Felix, who, shrinking from the word of the Spirit, deferred the all important work of repentance. He dwelt with clear- ness and force on each of the three themes of the apostle. In dwelling upon temperance, he remarked that another apostle has said, "add to your faith, temperance, placing temperance among the first of good works."- He then went on to show the subject, especially in its religious aspect. Mrs. Still worm and her family were there unattended by her spouse, the Deacon, who complained of a bad head-ache. It seemed to be epidemic, for Singleton's seat was vacant from the same cause, but he kept his wife at home making cakes and pies for the trade of the next week. Their hon- ors, the leading members of the corporation, were not present, the after- noon service, being as large a sacrifice to propriety and piety as they could afford to pay for the indulgence of serving the God of this world through the week. But the word was received with acceptance by many in the large audience. Among them were our friends, Mrs. Sealove and Miss Jenny, attended by that brawny, muscular, excellent-tempered soul, Capt. Sealove, so often quoted by his spouse, as the final authority. Mrs. Sea- love swallowing all that Mr. Mildmay said. Miss Jenny in her well starch- ed ruffles and Sunday silk, feeling more than usually competent to sit as critic of the sermon. Very near them sat the beautiful Mary Woodliffe, the rose all returned to her cheek, and her face expressive of a serene happiness. Her husband had stayed at home with the children, expecting his turn on Monday evening; and here I would suggest that Jerry set an excellent ex- ample to all husbands who often have no feeling for the everlastingly stay- at-home wife, and give them no chance for mental or spiritual improvement, but greedily engross it all to themselves. CHAPTER     VII. MORE PLOTTING.-NEW CABOLS. The Rum Club held another session early Monday morning. Their meetings were usually spontaneous, a sort of attraction, which drew them all together when the concerns of their craft required it. There again was the leader, Stronghead; there was the dark, musty looking six footer, Rock- heart; the daring, desperate rowdy, Jim Ready, higher charged than usual; the rising hero, Harry Wood. Deacon Stillworm was there too, now and then rising and walking about, very uneasy. In sneaked Singleton, the last of the groupe, more sneakingly than usual-being somewhat chopfallen at his late ill success.   O11. at) Ii MuS' ,t I)AT , DA N.   , "A, 1all," said Stronlilntl , gool Imorlling, Singleton. how deucedlly \To' missed your lit, last week." u Somebodty must have overheard us," said Singleton, 'and I am houlnd to find out who it is.' "Then you will," said Ready, with a big oath, " you are a sig-ht cunninger than any fox that ever ran at large." !  "u I got a thundering letter from my sister, about lill," said Stronghead; i  "these womel understand coming hard upon a fellow." "What do you tlink of our minister, brother Singleton?" "That's what we were discussing when you came in," said the Deacon. i k "It's no great matter what I think," said Singleton, "but if you want to know what such melt as Moreland, Grey and Bigland think of him, why  you will know before the week is out." "If he was my milister," said Stronglead, "he would either vacate his pulpit or I my snlat. we have no such doings in' our church, our minister minds his own business, and lets other people mind theirs. What does a ; parson know of trade?" "I must say, Singleton," said the Deacon, "I never was so stumled " p as when Mildmay camne out that fashion, righlt before Bigland and all them. The conference meeting I did not think mu(ch of, but on the Sabbath day, i full in the face of our leading men, 'tis something I could'nt have thought. 'Tis certainly as great a piece of clerical audacity as ever I heard of, and what beats all, is his daring to invite a temperance lecturer, and give notice : in church. And what makes it still worse we all thought so much of him ; and the very men he put upon so yesterday have been very kind to himl i in presents and invitations and such like notice." J  "The man has got no feeling," said Rockheart, " 'tis just like all the temperance men, they pretend to a great deal of humanity, and would stab their best friends to the heart and see us all beggars. I would stand hang- i man to most any of them, but here we are letting them run clear ahead of us. 'Tis moral suasion now they are weak, but it will be legal wlen thcy are strong. Stronghead is right, the best argument against them will be to show up one of their converts drunk, not half-seas-over, but dead, dead drunk ; and half a dozen such arguments as that will make the people see through this temperance sham. It's all a money concern. I've got a pige- on in my eye to bring down. I feel this evil as much as any of you.- There's the sailors, once the first thing when they came ashore was to come right to my store, but now there is everlastingly some of the Wash- ingtonions walking around the wharves ready to lure the crew to some o their starve-to-death hotels, they call Sailor's Homes." ' Take care, Rockheart," said Stronghead, "you are talling to o loud beware of eaves-droppers." With these words the conclave drew closer together, the speech was low- er, the tobacco whiffs went off faster as they measured their strength and laid their plans. The slow speech of the Deacon, and the hissing, smooth silvery voice of Singleton, mingled in with the deep grum tones of Rock- heart, and the determined words of Stronghead, as of a man who has con- sidered everything and made up his mind.

All thil Uider a cloud of tobacco smoke, that incense so grateful to Bacchus. The interview lasted about an hour, and the previous confederates left each for his own quarter. At g o'clock, A. M., the time mentioned, Mr. Mildmay went to the meet- ing of the board. A season of fervent supplication had prepared him to go calmly through the ordeal. After the usual preliminaries, Mr. M. was ask- ed why he had preached on the subject of temperance, and why he had in- vited a temperance lecturer to speak, without consulting the Board, and, also, why, when requested to recall the appointment, he had so pointedly refuised to do so. "We have allbeen sadly mistaken in you, Mr. Mildmav,' said the gentleman who had proposed the queries. We could not have inm agined that a person of your reflection and calmness would have given countenalce to this hmoement." "I am sorry, gentlemen," said Mr.' Mildmay, " that you should have so far mistaken my character, as to suppose for a moment that I could be in- sensible to a movement like the Temperance Reform. Inl answer to your first question, why I preached a temperance sermon? I must candidly say, I thought it was much needed among us, and I think a true minister will always sympathize with the popular feeling of the time, if that popular feeling be on the side of religion and humanity. 1 gave the invitation and notice from similar views, and under a positive impression that I was simp- ly using a privilege accorded me when I became your pastor. I told Mr. Moreland I felt it both against my conscience and my standing as a Chris- tian minister, to recall the appointment. After thus replying to your ques, ;tions, geitlemen, allow me to say that I feel deeply grateful to you for all your past kindness, but that very gratitude incites me to faithfulness." Mr. Bigfland. "I should like to enquire if Mr. Mildmay thinks it becom- :ing in a Christian minister to descend to personalities in a pulpit." Mr. Mildmay. "I am not conscious of having done so." Mr. Bigland. ' What meant then your onset upon the sin, so you styled :it, of :the liquor business? Here is our friend Vinting, one of our Board, a 'wine merchant. I may say the same of Mr. Grey, and both these gentle- men are very generous supporters of the ministry. Mr. Woith, and More' land, members of the Board, and very strong aids to the church, are also Jlarge wholesale liquor dealers. Then there is your own deacon, Deacon Stillworm, certainly a most unexceptionable, conscientious man, engaged in the distilling business. All these worthy gentlemen, without men- ' tioting many others, were compelled to hear all you were pleased to say against our business, and all felt it an extremely personal attack. Besides this, I consider it a very unwarrantable desecration of the holy Sabbath, to bring forward such secular topics." Mr. Mildmay. "Sir, when I speak of a class of offenders,' without in- dividualizing any one of that class, I do not consider myself so personal as to be ungentlemanly. Besides, sir, I took care to speak of the class to which you and the friends you mention, belong, with all the delicacy and charity consistent with faithfulness. There was nothing in my heart or in my manner like showing you up before the congregation. I guarded my speech   OR, OUR MUSIC AT DAWN.          33 with tenderness, as if warning a brother. But I conceive that no remarks, however mild, would be received. No, gentlemen,-it was the theme, not my manner of treating it, that offended." Mr. Bigland. "I am a plain man, of few words, as you all know; we may cdme to the gist of this matter at once. Mr. Mildmay shall you feel it your duty still to drive on with this Temperance Quixotism?" "Yes, sir." \-  ", Then, sir, the majority of the church, as far as I can learn, concur with with me in wishing you to vacate your place as our pastor at the expiration of the term for which you are engaged. Thllis you may learn for yourself, at the regular church meeting next Saturday evening." So the interview ended. Very crowded was the vestry in the evening at the lecture. Mrs. Sea- love, and her friend Miss Jenny, came very early in order to secure good i places. Miss Jenny as she passed up the broad aisle of the church, dis- S covered what proved to be a'train of gunpowder from the door to the pul- jF pit. This produced some little excitement at first. Just after the lecturer I began, there was a great cry of fire, and a person appeared at the door who said, "Gentlemen and ladies, there is a great fire down town." This strat- agem, for it was one, had the desired effect to break up the meeting. A couple of tar barrels had been set on fire in an old field outside the town, near enough to give a great light. Nobody knew who did it; but Miss I Jenny, whose privilege it was to live in the vicinity where Jim Ready flourished, said very sagely, "' She did not want anybody to tell her who cut up such a caper, nor who put him up to it, nor who paid for it." In- deed, Captain Sealove had whispered in the ear of his worthy spouse, that Bigland had been heard to say, there should not be a temperance lecture in i that house, cost what it would to prevent it. As to the train of gunpow- der, with the evidently charitable intention of blowing up the lecturer, and whoever else might be in the range of it, Miss Jenny asserted that there was but one person reckless and wicked enough to do it. But the responsibility of these conjectures must rest for the present with Miss Jenny. 4"I don't know," said Mrs. Sealove, "but the times are a coming we read of, when a man's foes shall be they of his own household. Captain Sea- love says, when this temperance work gets down where it cuts th the quick we shall see dreadful work. He says we are only hauling down into the' stream now, but we shall see hard weather before the voyage is up." "It is no child's play, already," said Miss Jenny. "As for you," said Mrs. Sealove, "When the lecturer and the folks come to know about finding that gunpowder, I should not wonder if they put a card in the paper."  Miss Jenny only drily remarked, "It was nothing to make a fuss about, only she wondered that folks that had eyes did not use them." "But, dear me," said Mrs. Sealove, "how beautifully the work goes on. Did you see the great roll the lecturer had of them that signed the pledge? The Captain says the persecution only enlivens up the work. The Capt. says, 'bad storms make good sailors. How beautifully Mr. Mildmay sang 5  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7095-00000018"/> 34           TEI RAIgVEII IE: that temperance hymn! Wonder what the corporation did this morning. I saw them all a-going, and I did pity poor parson Mildmay, so like a lamb among wolves." Miss Jenny said, that "she did'nt see for her part why Mr. Mildmay could'nt have been a good temperance man and kept still about it, for he knew before hand just what folks he had to deal with." "Now you are all at fault, Miss Jenny," said Mrs. Sealove. "Mr. Mild- may thinks nothing of himself as to preaching. It comes too easy to him for that. It's handed right down to him. He's got the gift of the minis- try. Woman, don't you believe in such a thing? I do, as much as I believe I have got these spectacles on. He's got good larning, it is true, but that's only the gold the jewel is set in. But I'll tell you what pleased me well, and always does, when I see them lately; Lucy Riverly and her noble looking son, that used to be such- an awful drinker." "To-morrow is voting day," continued Miss Jenny, "when I see these reformed people well through that, I shall have some little hope of them." The Captain now entered, and very soon Miss Jenny took her leave. William. or Will Riverly, as he was familiarily called, was a young man of the most kindly and generous feelings, but inherited from his unfortunate father a predisposition to inebriety. His father went to the drunkard's grave while he was yet a mere lad. He was handsome and affectionate, possessing all those pleasant domestic traits which a mother so values and enjoys in a son. Mrs. Riverly having buried her husband and her children, centered the home affections of a most sweet and lovely nature in her son. Often as she parted the curling locks on his open forehead, and looked upon-the sweet and noble expression of his face when a little boy, had she indulged a mothers visions of hope and joy. "You will be my honor and my comfort yet, won't you, dear Willie?" she would say, as she folded him to her bosom, and kissed her loving boy. She gave him a good common education, and a good trade, while supporting both herself and him by her unwearied in- dustry. Above all she sought, by the continued influence of her own meek example and excellent teaching, to bring him to Christ. In this she was blest so -far that he was converted, joined the church, and walked well for a season. Poor Mrs. Riverly, she was too watchful a mother not to be on her guard against the first symptoms of the hereditary taint, and sought con- tinually to strengthen him, and prevent his fall. But the sinres and wiles of the devil were too much for him-he was betrayed, and he fell. His very companionableness was a disadvantage to him. The unsuspecting truthfulness of his nature left him more exposed to the wiles of those whose foils were set in every street. His mother was everything to him at home, but he had no father to look out for him among the haunts of men. For three sorrowful years, had his mother sorrowed almost to death, when the day star of temperance arose, and the benighted wanderer was restored to her once more. Her joy was deep seated as her life, it meekly shone through her eyes, and thrilled through the very tones of her voice. Who could have thought, as her graceful and goodly son sat by her side on the Sabbath, com- pletely restored to God and man, that there lived a wretch so depraved that he could look at that sight and plot his destruction? Yet such a thorough- //   OR, OUR MUSIC AT DAWN.         35 ly demonized wretch there was, and poor Riverly was marked out in that very place to be one of the victims of the rumselling conspiracy. As a butcher looking at a flock of innocent lambs, regards not their innocence and beauty, but has his eye on those most fit for the shambles, so it was here; the destroyer thought only that he hoped, in the generous, social, truthful character of that youth, to find grounds for betrayal. The dealer in lamb's flesh but follows his calling, allowed -by the wants of Society.- But what shall we say of the dealers in men, who sell in their shambles soul and body? But we must go on with our story. The sun rose splendidly on the day so exciting to the rival parties con- i; cerned. At an early hour the streets were alive with men hurrying to the polls to exercise the highest, but much abused privilege of a freeman.- Each party was on the alert doing its utmost. Carriages were seen going into the most obscure parts of the city, often bringing some poor wretched invalid, only thought of once a year. The destroyer of souls rejoiced in that day, for he knew that many a man, erect in the pride of maimhood that / morning, would be sunk lower than the brutes by night. Each party treat- ed, and brought over many by the love of rum. There was a shop open- ed in the vicinity for the first time that day in front of an old building. It had the name of being a temperance shop; quite a tempting display at- ; tracted the eye. Decanters of lemonade, root beer, and vessels steaming with strong fragrant coffee, seemed the beverages. Oysters, cakes, and some very luscious looking mince pies, invited the appetite. Among the crowd i came up the employers and the employed, to exercise their rights as free- men. The employer himself, as often the gull of the knowing ones, who move the wheels of the political machinery. In the crowd came William Riverly a far different person from what he i: had been the three preceeding years, for then he had come up royally drunk, to prove his title to liberty and equality, by voting according to the bidding of the man who had made a beast of him. But even now, Will  was much excited by the day, being of that ardent temperament that the ' wily leaders of party will always seek to play upon. He did not come up to the polls unwarned of his mother, who in the simplicity of her heart thought no man had a right to vote unless he knew who and what he was voting for. Poor Will heard her with the consideration with which he always listen- ed to his mother, but it made no due impression, because he was under the common prejudice that women know nothing of politics. So he went with the rest of the journeymen of his wealthy employer, who was a high party 5 man, and voted as he did for this reason, that Mr. Emmons knew enough to J know which was the right side and he had made it plain to him. Besides William loved Emmons who was very generous as an employer, and Wil- liam was much swayed by his affections. Having given in their votes, the rest of the day was all holiday to Mr. E Emnon's workmen. i  "Come," said Jake White to Riverly, "let us go into this shop'and get our dinner; those pies look first rate, and there is a nice pretty girl behind the counter."  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7095-00000019"/> 3G            THE REVEILLE : Will needed no further inducement. They both went in. "How much is that pie in the deep dish?" said Riverly. "Only ninepence," said the girl. The pies had been thus prepared. They were baked, and while warm the crust was lifted and they were saturated with brandy. "This pie tastes strong of brandy," said Riverly. "What if it does?" said Jake White, "Temperance folks use brandy in cooking-mother is a temperance woman, and she does, and she says it don't do a mite of harm." The pies were luscious, and re-assured by his companion, Riverly eat away upon them, one did not answer, and he tried another; then he must have a glass of root beer. Jake eat, and left him in the shop. He never was seen to come out of the shop that day. It was observed the shop had not always the same attendant; sometimes it was a young girl, sometimes an old woman, at other times a boy. There were others who went into that shop that day who did not come out as they went in. William Riverly's good motherdid not expeet him home early as usual that evening, as it was a holiday. But the ever attentive, loving, mother, rose from her work at dark, and made the room look as pleasant as possible. She prepared a better supper than usual as it was a holiday. The milk white cloth was spread upon the table, and her luxuries so arranged as to look inviting. All her little arrangements made, she sat down to her work again, but every few moments her eyes were lifted to the clock. It struck eight. He will be in soon, thought she, and began to sing the evening hymn they usually sang together before they parted for the night. Half past eight came. No William yet. She rose, went to the window, drew back the curtain and looked up and down the street, by the clear moon- light. $he saw not the dear object of her search. Stle sat down again, but did not resume her work. Somehow, every stroke of that clock seem- ed beating into her heart.. There was a dread she dared not shape into thought which made her shiver with agitation. Nine o'clock came, and no son yet. There was one continual resort of sister Riverly; that was the mercy seat. Lowly she knelt before the Lord. "Oh, thou blessed one," said she, " thou who hast given thy sure promise to widows and orphans; thou, dear Lord knowest how my heart yearns over my son; have mercy upon him; save my child." She paused; the blood rushed to her face for she heard a sudden noise; the door was rudely thrown open, and two rough looking men bore in her son, her only son, drunk and insensible. "Here's your son marm ;" said they, "thought he was one of Hawkin's reformed ones." With this taunt, the brutes laid Will on a couch, and left the house.- The heart-stricken mother sat for a time stupified with the shock. So fearfully alone with the son whom she had fondly believed saved. Ah none but a mothelwho has known this grief of griefs, can judge of her feelings. Her son had never before sunk so low as this. He had been al- most constantly excited, and she had tasted what was worse than the biter- ness of death, in seeing him thus; but he had now fallen lower than ever.   OR, OUIR MUSIC AT DAWN.         37 When he turned, so deep liad been Ilis repentance, that the heart of a mother readily trusted and believed that her darling was saved. Life's tempests had already almost broken her frail barque to pie&amp;es. a Oh, Wil- liam, William," said she, as she knelt down beside llim, and her tears florw- ed plentifully over his senseless face, "This is worse than to see him dead! Oh! he llhas killed nme. Oh! Godl, whose cruel work is this? Thllou know- [ est, and I feel that he has been cruelly led away. Such hopes, such sweet, precious hopes as I had for him, must I give them up forever?" The fire in the stove went down, the lamp glimmered dimly, the room grew cold and dark, but poor Lucy Riverly heeded it not; there she sat hanging over her son, her lost son ; no more words left her lips, but a long silent agony of prayer went up to heaven that night. The stars faded away, a cheerful light came over the sky, but it could not cheer that darkened home. Then the return of day seemed to bring to Mrs. Riverly a more stern realization of her sonsfate, yet that sad day, like all her other sad days, was opened by her in supplication and thanklisglving. Lucy Rivelly thallnked God for a Saviour who can save to the utmost. She arose, set her room in order, sighed as she put away the delicacies she had prepared to please her son the evening pefore, watered his pet rose bush, mingling her tears with the crystal water, and after a slight meal sat down to her work. Presently her son began to recover from his drunken sleep. His mother said nothing, but pouring out a cup of coffee, and preparing it with her usual care handed it to him. He looked up in her mild, sorrowful face. "How can you be so good," said he, "to such a wretch as I am? How pale you look! Oh! mother, I have killed all your hopes." He turned his face away and wept. His mother in the course of the day, recovered in a measure, that meek self possession which so long covered a broken heart from all eyes but those of a pitying God. All that William could tell his mother was, that after he went into the shop and had eaten the pies, he was mad for something to drink. He took some beer, it was highly aromatic and sweet, but he said he thought there was rum in- it. Then he drank some coffee. It was strong, rich and sweet, but instead of enlivening him, it made him stupid and mawkish. He went back to the root beer, but that would not do now. The young girl in attendance observed to him that he did not look well, and invited him into a back parlor to lie down. New stimulants artfully given, soon fitted him' to be the tool of their purpose, and'he was brought home drunk. This, alas, was not the end of it, it was only the beginning of the end. The day following the dreadful night, his penitence seemed sincere; but the traitor within was roused and foes without were on the alert. Jerry Woodlffe, Bill Handy and other of his temperance comrades, did their best to strengthen him; his faithful mother wept and prayed, al- though her first happy faith in his reformation was gone. In a few days he was drunk again. He soon became utterly insensible to his comrades' influence, and could see his once loved mother's distress with stolid indiffer- ence. There was one-result of Will Riverly's fall; -- Singleton, whose shop he frequented, soon wormed out of him the secret of Jerry's discovery and exposure of his villainous beer scheme. From that hour Jerry was a marked man.  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7095-00000020"/> 38            THF. REV ILLt,  CHAPTER     VIII. PATRICK SHANNON. Miss Jenny Brown emnloyed as her factotum a very honest Irishman,- one Patrick Shannon, who boasted his origin from "Drogheda, ould Ire- land." He did chores for many people whom Miss Jenny knew, and as he was observant, communicative and quite a news-gatherer, he was very use- ful to Miss Jenny in her line of communication, and often supplied her with a fresh stock of the current news. "Miss Jenny" he said, " was so discrate and sinsible, he would be more free to tell her his thoughts, thin any lady in Ameriky." He had taken the pledge in Ireland, and was a zealous temperance man. He was acquainted with all that part of the city, and interested himself in all that was going on. He was very shrewd and quick-witted. Soon after poor Riverly's fall, Patrick was in Miss Jenny's one morning, and he thus began,- "Ah! is n't it a poor thing this that happened to young Riverly?  "I expected it," answered Miss Jenny, " if people will run into tempta- tion they must expect to fall." "It's like yees would not blame him intirely, Miss Jenny," said Pat, "if yees knew all about it, shure." "And do you know all about it, Pat?" asked Miss Jenny. "To be shure thin I do," answered Pat. "I do odd jobs for Mr. Em- mons at his place, and there is n't a better journeyman in it nor William Riverly; the finest looking figure of a man too I iver see betwane my two eyes; the more's the pity; sorra light on thim that made a brute beast of him." "I know all that myself," said Miss Jenny, who was often impatient at Pat's circomlocutions. "Howld and I'll tell yees," said Pat, " ye know, Miss Jenny, me place is jist convanient to Jim Ready's; bad luck to me for that same,--it's a poor thing to live in such a neighborhood. I can,t kape the matter of a chick, nor the likes of a cabbage to stand in the garden, that the owld wo- man's so fond of. Shure yees could n't tell me of a place, Miss Jenny?" ("No, I do not know of a place, but what of this sad affair?" "Ah, shure I was vexin' about the cabbages," said Pat, " but Miss Jenny I'll tell you a thing. It was Jim Ready's own dirty silf (the saints be over us) that had the shop opened in the owld tenement, votin' day." "I did n't hear he was there." said Miss Jenny. "Not he himself,--by the powers he's too cunning for that. Don't the   oR, OUR MUSIC A T D1AxN.         39 divil hide his horn, (saving your presence,) when he's scheming?

But shure Miss Jen- ny, you'd not be afther tilling what may bring Pat into throuble?" "You may believe me," said Miss Jenny, "I won't tell anything that would injure you. I am too good a friend to you for that." "May the light of Hiven never lave your sowl thin. There rvas Jim Ready, I said, but though the other' bothered me listeninl', he spoke so low and quiet, it's my thinkin' 't was that Jim Singleton." "Are you sure?" asked Miss Jenny, " he's a brother in our church!" "He's a poor brother, thin, any way," said Pat, " always bateing it was not himself in spach with Ready that night,--and I'll tell yees now what the two let on.-' There's three caught,' says Ready, 'Twas thim pies and beer did the business for Riverly.' I hope nobody will find it out,' says the other, drumlie and low. Thin Ready swore with an oath big enough to choke him, (Saint Patrick deliver us) that he did not care who found it out what he did, so that he pocketed the twinty; and it's doubled to forty now, says he, and we'll aisy make it fifty, Stronghead is so well pleased." "'But I'm in dread that Mildmay may get at it,' says the other, 'and Jerry knows I would n't have done it only to stop the agitation.' " "Says Ready, ' don't be backing out now, you have done the thing up so handsomely, else maybe Stronghead will be mad, and you'll lose your,. share of the money.' Bother on me, I was like to make a clane lape over the fince, and give the couple of big knaves their measure on the ground. But that same rascal, Ready, is a great boxer and prize fighter, and the sicond thought kimn over me that he might do me an ill turn, for he is cruel strong, and that wicked (the saints bless us) it's a fear to be near him whin he's in a passion; he's the divil intirely. ' Whin will he pay us,' says the spalpeen, his thin voice skimming off to a whisper. 'To-morrow,' says Ready.  Good niight,' says the other. The divil of a good night, says I, down in the shid; bad luck to yees for a couple of black hearted rogues that ye be, who would break a widdy's heart and ruin as manly a lad as iver was rared in the counthry, just to fill your own dirty pockets; sorry luck to ye. Now Miss Jenny you won't be afther mintionin' to your own shad- ow, if that could rason, for it would bring a dale of throuble on me. Ready wouldasy burn the owld place some night, and my two darlins, not to min- tion myself and the mother?" Miss Jenny again assured Patrick she would keep the secret. "That's the jewel of a lady," said he. She easily agreed to keep the story private, for it was one of Miss Jen- ny's peculiar pleasures to get hold of some piece of news, and keep it from her friend, Mrs. Sealove, and when the story came out and it was reported to her as news; it was her glory to say that she had known of the affair some time before, and when asked why she was so private, to say, with a mysterious air, ' she never told all she knew, by a great deal.' So Patrick left his story in safe hands.  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7095-00000021"/> 40           .THE REVEILLE: Singleton had indeed in his late steps, spurred on by spite and avarice, enlarged his sphere of iniquity. To use the expressive Scripture phrase,-- che had flattered himself in his iniquity till it was found to be hateful." He had gone beyond his own power of self-deception, and began to feel himself the scoundrel he really was, The gates of the inward hell began  slowly to open upon him, and he shuddered and shrunk from the dark, dark fathomless abyss; but a horrid impetus he could no longer master, urged him on. CHAPTER     IX. CHURCH MEETING. Saturday evening arrived, the time the church meeting was to come off. Let us look at Mr. Mildmay's study. His wife was one of those true-hearted -women, who are meet companions for a Christian minister. She had voun- ted the cost before she assumed the duty. She expected no holiday life as the pet of the parish; no- mere 'popular show of usefulness in the way of outwardly building up her own church. Gentle and conciliating in her manners to all, those who expected from that mild manner that she would in any way compromise principles, would be greatly disappointed. She -was firm as a rock. She had a family, but no fear of risking favor for them obstructed the Christian dignity of her faithfulness. She understood the true meaning of that sacred saying,-"Every wise' woman buildeth her house, but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands." Her children she endeavored, by the help of God so to educate as to have an innate title to respect. She had already begun to reap the rich reward of this domes- tic culture. Helen Mildmay, the eldest child, at this time in the very bud :nd blush of youthful loveliness, seemed to forget her personal advantages in the zeal with which she followed up her mother's course. Especially among her brothers and sisters was her influence most happy in leading them on in the right' path. Helen was out with the children on a walk, and their father and mother were alone in the study. It was twilight; the evening prayer had been offered; the evening psalm sung. They were thinking of the coming trial, when they were informed that Mrs. Riverly was in the parlor below. The Mildmays had been out of town since Monday, and they khew not what had befallen her son. But the moment they saw her, they perceived that some great sorrow overwhelmed her. "What is the matter, dear sistet iRiverly?" said Mrs Mildmay.   OR, OUR MUSIC AT DAWN.          41 Is William sick?" enquired the pastor. "Worse than that!" exclaimed the afflicted mother, bursting into tears as she spoke. "He is lost! I st! lost!" "Do not say so," sail Mr. Mildmay, " but sit down, compose yourself and tell us all, for something may yet be done for your son." She shook her head, as if she feared it was a hopeless case, but comforted by their kind expressions, she told them her sad story, and that her son had been again intoxicated since voting day, and she had come to ask her pastors influence. This Mr. Mildmay promised.  He then told her they were going to church meeting, and under what circumstances. "Can I be of any service to you?" said Mrs. Riverly, at once looking be- yond her own sorrow. "If you feel equal to it," said he, "I wish you would go, your prayers will help me. The very sight of you, by reminding me of your cruel wrongs, will stir me up to faithfulness." The church in general were much attached to their minister and his wife. But the party against Mildmay had been indefatigably busy that week.- Mildmay was represented as a very fanatical person, who went for every- thing new; who Would split the church sooner than not have his own way. He had needlessly affronted their strongest men. His fame as a preach- er had spoilt him, and now he thought he was going to lord it over every body. To those in favor of temperance, it was said, that though temper- ance was a good thing, nothing ought to divide the church, "united we stand, divided we fall." To the prudent and worldly-wise it was said, there is Grey, Bigland, and many other leading men, say that either they or Mildmay shall leave. In consequence of these efforts, Mr. Mildmay and his wife were looked upon as they entered, not with the respectful regard they had formerly in- spired, but with eyes askance, and a curious cold speculation as to the way they would deport themselves. A number there were, however as we trust there are in every church, the salt of the earth, " unshaken, unseduced, unterrified." These with unceasing prayer awaited the result. Deacon Stillworm was present, and much to his annoyance his wife also. Hu always felt trammeled in his movements by her presence. The minister opened the meeting with prayer. Deacon Stillworm made a motion to rise and state the business before the meeting, but just then encountered a forbidding glance from Mrs. Scill- worm, which quieted him for the time, and Deacon Olden did the work. Grievances were stated and discussed, when Singleton arose. He appe ed a good deal more agitated than usual, though with an evident effort 0Ecalm- ness, he said :-               - "For his part, he had always liked their pastor. He had voted for his coming, and should vote for his stay, if he would confine himself to the work of the gospel. He said that his brethren knew that he had always been temperate, and was as much for temperance as any body; but there always were drunkards, and there always would be.

The bible said, wille cheered the heart of God and man.' The Savior turned water into wine. He did'nt want better example than that; if liquor was put to bad uses so was everything else, but all were the creatures of God, and all good, if St. Paul was any authority. If Mr. Mildmay could not fellowship such breth- ren as brother Bigland and Deacon Stillworm, who had been the building up of that church and congregation, as much as lie did straggling temper- ance lecturers, why, for one, he must confess, though of course he was sorry to say it, he saw no way but to part." Mrs. Handy entered while Singleton was talking, unperceived by him. "See him," said she to Mary Woodliffe, who sat near her, " up and speak- ing as smooth as ever. Ioe's forgot the mystery of the beer bottles; it's well he has set down. I hav'nt got patience to hear him." Another brother now rose. tie expressed great personal regard for Mr. Mildmay. He lhoped brother Mildmay would take into prayerful consider- ation his duty tolthe church, and if any of the brethren of the congrega- tion objected to hearing about temperance, it was best to let them have their way. We must seeK the things that make for peaee, and suppose we have wrong-doers among us, we cannot help that; Judas was among the holy twelve; the tares and the wheat must grow together until the time of harvest. We cannot go any where but we shall find something., He never expected to see a perfect christian, much more a perfect church, this side of Jordan. Old Deacon Olden said he had been a member of a church fifty odd years; and he never remembered just such a time as the present. He did'lt see the use of so much controversy about liquor. He remembered the time when he never put up at a minister's house, or any other of his brethren, without being asked to take a warm night-cap when he went to bed, which was nothing more nor less than a strong hot sling ; and to his mind they had better times than now; they had'nt so many new things to think on. These things would take care of themselves. They are only the worse for being meddled with. He did not expect to put a young head on old shoulders; .but when brother Mildmay had seen as many years as he had he would see the folly of all these new notions and let things go on in the church as they always had done. Olden then sat down, anld Deacon Stillworm made another attempt tc rise; but his wife, who perceived the working of his mind, had gradually drawn nearer, set her foot upon his with ialher an unpleasant pressure. As she did so he looked at her, and she made silent movements with her mouth in which the Deacon read plainly, ("Don't make a fool of yourself. The Deacon was compelled to be content and keep his seat. Mrs. Handy next arose. She said:-"It was not in the general order of things there, for women to speak in church meetings, hut when they were going to move her candlestick out of its place she meant to. have something to say about it. If ever there was a good man upon earth it is brother Mildmay, and you know it brothers and sisters, as well as I do; and 11[ you have against him is, because he is against men's gettuing rich by theit brother's blood. To speak plain, he, is not for the rum trade; and   OR, OUR MUSIC AT DAWN.          43 some men love rum money better than their own souls. There's a sight in this house now, preaches temperance louder than ten thousand brother Mild- may's. There sits a poor sister in this house who has done nothing but weep ever since she came in. Every one of her tears will have a voice to cry out against them in the great day; them sinners, the rumsellers. There are many here who think just as I do, only they are afraid to speak; but I have always found it best for my soul's health to free my mind, and it will be for yours to testify for God and your minister, and now, who is on the Lord's side? Let him speak. The free spirit of Sister Haridy seemed to loose the bonds of others. Several rose and spoke in favor of brother Mildmay. Last of all, sister Riverly rose trembling. "' When I think," said she, 4' of what has befallen me since last in this place, I feel too troubled to speak. But if I was dying I would ask for strength to rise to witness for one who has been a faithful shepherd to us in all sea- sons, leading us to the green pastures, and by the still waters. Oh! my brethren and sisters, had you had this evil brought home to you, you would not persecute that dear servant of God for pleading against it. My bless- ing be ever on his head."' She could say no more; sobs and tears prevented her. There was silence for a time; her sorrow filled the house, and stern men melted and weit. At last the minister rose; wiping away his tears he said :- "My best defence has been already made. No argument have I to bring so potent as this sorrow that could not be contained; the anguish of a mother weeping for her first born; not like Rachel of old, ah! no, but with more cruel grief; for had the sword of some Herod slain him in smil- ing infancy, it ware mercy to this. If men having the hearts of men can -be deaf to such pleading, I might as well undertake to charm the savage tiger to listen t the words of humanity. I despair of convincing such men of the inperative necessity of such preaching as has offended them; and before Gqa, if I had never before entered upon this work, what I have witnessed thisevening, would bind me to the temperance cause heart and soul, till its dvine object is effected." Singleton hen rose, shook his sleek locks, and moved that Deacon Still- worm take tie vote of the meeting. His wife had never stopped weeping since sister liverly spoke, so the Deacon rose without obstruction, and took the voe. The events of the evening had produced such an effect that after al the overawing influence of the rumsellers, their party could only get a ie vote, and the business was referred to another church meeting. ,'     S       '       ,/  ,  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7095-00000023"/> lal4         rCBzB T REVEILLE : CHAPTER X. THE RESCUE. Revenge on the one hand, and success on the other, sharpened the appe- tite of Singleton for a new victim, and Jerry was now the object in chase, but he was aware of his tricks and foiled all his cunning devices. "You need not try," said Stronghead, " he knovs you too well. The bare sight of you is as good as a temperance lecture to keep him straight. You must let him alone till he is more off his guard, er somebody else must do the business." Quite a long time Jerry distanced the Rum Demon, but one morning he happened to be standing beside his dray. Work chenced to be a little dull just at the time, and Rockheart stepped up tc him and said very civily, that he would like to employ him to bring up some sugar, rice and molasses. Jerry consented. From that day he gave him work, saying he had rather employ him than other draymen, for he was bo be depended on. He had not mentioned his new employer to his wife, tecause, said he to himself, Mary, like a real woman is too skittish. But one day when Rock- heart paid him very liberally for a job, poor Jerry's heat; warmed by this show of kindness, and he could not refrain from mentioning t to Mary. As he sat by the fire one evening; "Mary," said he, " the tempeiance folks must not be too uncharitable, all rumsellers ain't alike; some of them is pretty fair after'all." Mary was sitting on a cricket near him, toasting some bread at the stove, and she turned round and looked up at him wih her quick, bright eyes. "Jerry," said she, "what do you mean?" ("Why," said lhe, " there's Rockheart, he isn't the worst nan that ever was.)" Alary dropped the toasting fork. "Jerry," exclaimed she,"'you ain't standing up for Rockheart, are you, that bad man that's been th ruin of so many poor sailors; they say he tolls them into that long dark sore of his, gets them drunk and then robs them." "Mary," said Jerry, " you must not believe all you hear. I1 tell you what makes me speak; business was rather dull with me, and lockheart came of his own accord and offered to employ me, because, he sid, I was the best drayman in the city ; yes, and he paid. me liberally, too.' ", Have'nt you got common sense, Jerry," said his wife, 1" to bow that Rockheart is trying to come round you. Don't you know aboutRiverly. Now, Jer:y, I shall never rest, till you promise me not to do anothr job for Rockheart." "You'll let me get through this one, for he paid me for it partl, before- hand."   OR, OUR tMUSIC AT DAWN.         45 f' No, you must not finish it," said his wife. "Mary, don't teaze me, I must just finish this, and I will do no more; but this I am engaged to do." Jerry did not confess to Mary how much the smell of the liquor in the store had tempted him. Next morning Jerry went to his work. Mary was acquainted with a young temperance man, whose business was such, that he was often about the wharves. She went down to his home very early, and said to him, ;' Steenie, I want you to keep an eye upon Jerry to-day. He is working for Rockheart, and I feel sure they are trying to lay a trap for him; so be round there as much as you can." Mary slipped back in time to have breakfast ready for Jerry, and he none the wiser. After the meal, Jerry went whistling to his work, counting over in his own mind his gains, and not thinking so much of temptations as that faithful wife. Rockheart looked as graciously upon Jerry as his dark, grim face could, though a smile upon him looked as much out of place as sunshine in a murky dun- geon. Jerry was really very quick and active, and Rockheart began to scruple whether it was best to sacrifice him to the interests of the craft.- But then he was bound to help the Rum Club out in their attack upon the temperance men. Indeed, so long had all the decision in the mind of Rock- heart, been on the side of Satan, it would have been a miracle for him to choose the right in any case. Rockheart had been getting some sailors drunk the night before. The smell from the glasses greeted the nostrils of Jerry, and he bemoan to feel a secret awakening of the old appetite. He cast a longing look at the tumblers as they stood on the top of the hogs- heads. He began to feel like the fabled Tantalus. Here were rivers of what he might not taste. Rockheart, with his watchful, snakey eyes, saw in a moment that the destined victim faltered. "Jerry," said he, ca my fine fellow, it wont hurt your temperance notions will it, just to draw off some of this canary wine into this demijohn. I want it to send to a customer, and our hands are full to day." "I had rather not, Mr. Rockheart," said Jerry. "Jut as you please," said the tempter, " but this wine is not going to make any one drunk, it is going right to church, it is for the communion table. Encouraged by this, Jerry consented to fill the demijohn. The scent of the richly flavored wine, tempted him; his mouth watered, and his excited look, as he rose from filling the demijohn, showed Rockheart that now was the time to strike the blow.. He watched his prey with the burning glare of a tiger. "Jerry," said he, pouring out a generous tumbler of the rich wine, "come, poor fellow, you have been hard at work, come, your temperance folks don't mind taking wine when the system is down, as a medicine you know.- Come, this will set you right up." The wine looked clear in the glass. It gave forth its color aright. Jerry thought of wife and children, but the longing he had for the liquor was so great that he seized the tumbler. He hesitated an instant to raise it to his lips, when suddenly a strong arm arrested his. "Are you mad, Jerry?" said the faithful Steenie, as he dashed the tumbler to the ground, and fend- ed off Rockheart. Rockheart was a giant, but Steenie was very strong and thick set.  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7095-00000024"/> "You are a villain and a rascal," said Rockheart, choking with rage. " Clear out of my store, you have no business here." " Yes I have business here," said Steenie, " I have business anywhere I can save a creature from these confounded rum traps.  Come along Jerry, and don't trust yourself in the lion's jaws again." " Stop," said Rockheart to Jerry, " don't mind that crazy fellow, I have got another first rate job for you to-day." " No sir," said Jerry, and he felt like a man, who having risen and walk- ed in his sleep, wakes and finds himself on the brink of a tremendous pre- cipice, and shudders to think of the danger he has escaped.  "And how came you in just in time to save me ?" said he to his deliverer. I owe you more than my life." " That's telling," said Steenie. " A little bird told me what a snare was laid for you. I was watching all the time, and saw all the play. " Come," said Jerry, "it is about dinner time, come home and take a bite with me." Mary's lovely eyes sparkled when she saw her husband and Steeniecom- ing in.  He very frankly told her his narrow escape, and he wondered much, who in the world could have set Steenie on: but Steenie winked hard at Mary, to keep dark.  They were all happy; the children caught the feeling, though they could not realize the cause. Their simple, but sa- vory dinner went off with a good zest; their hearts were all so light and so thankful. They had just finished their repast, when their neighbor, Mrs. Sealove, came in with a paper. It was a paper printed in the city, and the organ of the rum faction. The Pulpit and the Press, are two powerful engines for good or evil, in a country where both are free.  The pulpit, from certain abuses of it, has been called " the Coward's Fortress," the press is no less so. A man with a very small soul, may make no very inconsiderable show in either position and dressed in a little brief autlhority, may "play such fantastic tricks be- fore high Heaven, as makes the angels weep."  An editor has a fearful re- sponsibility of which these ephemeral men I have spoken of are not aware. "By thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be con- demned."   If these words, spoken by the Truth "itself," be an onerous consideration for private individuals how much more should they impress those who contribute to give the body of the times its shape and pressure, these newspaper editors.  The sphere of the pulpit is narrow to his, who goes now on the wings of the lightning, everywhere, but wo to those who live in the daily abuse of this great trust, who turn that which should be light in the world, into outer darkness, and prostitute for base hire, or petty personal interests, the noble powers of the press.  That judge who shall call us to account for every trust committed to our care, that Being of whom these men have no real knowledge, in whom they have no real belief, will destroy them and their works.  " They shall utterly perish in their own corruption."  A very crawling sample of this species had wormed himself into the editorship of the paper which Mr. Sealove now brought in. " I want, you just to hear this," said she, to the little group in her neigh- bors kitchen. tThe Captain says he never saw the beat of it; do hear it,    ORl, OUR MUSIC A'T DAWN.          47 this is the heading of the piece:  ' The Temperance HIlmbug.'  Tat'. 0  That's pretty."  "Our readers will recollect that when the Washiligtollialls lirst began to get up an excitement in the city, and make a sioev of reloried inebriates, as they called them, we pronounced the whole afhair as great a humbug as ever was palmed off upon a community, equally obnoxious, and more obtrusive upon the hoe community than the negro maclia. Well behold the whole affair is blown up as wle said it swould be; eight or tenl of their reformed men are getting drunk wit h a new zest, and soee oftheir own lecturers it is said -wet their whistles before speakinig. They rant and ave, but thea hubbhub is over, the game is up, and this is the end  of a most impudent onset, by press and lecturing, on the business of the  most respect- able and influential men in the cmmLunity. We hear that a new  lecturer one of the Vesuvius order, arrived yesterday.  We advise him to pack up and be marching, oi he will get a tar jacket, ornamented with feathers be- fore he knows it; for our people have had enough of this busilless."  "Did you ever hear the like before," said Mrs. Sealove, "such a string of falsehoods; but here is more, worse yet."  "The reverend Mr. M----y has rode his temperance hobby till he has fairly, pranced himself olut of his pulpit, and a very conveniently large salary. We have learned from the best authority that although in a late church meeting, he bribed one or two of the weaker sisters (who happened to have sols who were jolly fellows) to cry and sni- vel and get up an excitement in his favor, by  which measure he procured a tie vote on the motion for his dismissal; yet it is a matter of certainty that all of his society are'sick of his eccentricity, and clerical arrogance.- They are resolved that he shall take himself and his talents where people are fools enough to pay    for being insulted to their faces.  We rather think the reverend will take care how   he risks the loaves and fishes, for we have always found a good lesson on the pocket extremely serviceable to these libellous reformers, in teaching them good manners and common sense. " Captain Sealove says," said Mrs. S., pushing up her spectacles as she finished the paragraph, ,, if any man on shipboard should undertake to talk so about such a man as Mr. Mildmay, hle would get a souse into salt water about the quickest. He says, if these sort of newspaper editors go on, they will lie away all that is good in the country." Mary who loved her minister, sat thoughtfully a minute or two and theen said, ,, I have it, I've found a sauce for this chicken." Who Mary got to help her, is of little moment to the story.  However the following article appeared next day in the paper: It was headed "Riot Scuffle, and   Insult from a     Temperance M an." "Mr. Editor,-You were yesterday congratulating the public that the cold, watery cloud, that has lately hung over our city, had melted into thin air, but yesterday there was quite a tempest originated from this trouble- some visitant. To be serious, we fear the public authorities will be driven to take up the    matter, to prevent lynch law   from taking its course. T he correct story is this: A very worthy citizen had just handed one of his employees, who was fatigued with labor, a glass of wine, when one of these ffirious fanatics, a very ordinary person, rushed into the store of this gentleman, dashed the glass of wine upon the floor, beat off the gentle-   &#xD;<pb n="48" xml:id="VAC7095-00000025"/> 48            THE REVEILLE: man, and bore off the employee in triumph. Truly, we have come. to a' strange pass, when a worthy citizen has his premises thus intruded upon, and his business interfered with by an insolent rowdy." The piece was signed "Order." To this article was appended a long note of the editors'. But the next day came out a card in the temperance paper. "A temperance lady, (but not one of the 'Weaker Sisters,') returns her thanks to the editor of --  for publishing so promptly, her communica- tion signed 'Order,' and also for the continued though unwilling aid he ren- ders the temperance cause. The lady wished that the news bf a victory achieved over the rumsellers, should be certain to reach them, and has thus managed to use their own organ to convey to them the tidings."

A fashionable young man was lounging in an arm chair, at the window of a richly furnished room.  Another young man was lying upon a sofa reading. A lady sat at her embroidery in the same apartment. The lady, :i evidently the mistress of the mansion, was in one of those costly mornlilng dresses in which some of the devotees of fashion love to display a careless- ness of wealth, and expensive negligence. She was as perfect and wisc a worldling as any hard-headed statesman that ever gave up the highest claims of humanity for the lure of place and profit. "Who is that charming young lady passing ?" said he at the window, to the lady. The lady rose and looked out of the window between the draping of the heavy damask curtains. "It is Miss Helen Mildmay;" said she, "I do not think her so very beau- tiful, perhaps because she is so completely outre." "Allow me to differ from you, aunt," said the young man on the sofa, laying down his book, "she is the most beautiful girl in the city." " No one thinks so but yourself, Edward." "She is very eccentric," said the lady. " Ter father is our pastor, and yet I must say that he and his wife are such violent ultras that they have completely spoiled the girl.  Indeed it is lamentable that persons of their education and rank should patronize these vulgar ultraisms.  If they do not lose caste themselves, their children become so tinged witll these iln sane ideas that they forfeit all claim to good society. And so it will be with Miss Mildmay." "That may all be correct; but still, it is true that she is beautiful.  I have rarely seen her except in church, and then she always suggests to me the pictures of the lovely Madonnas and chaste St. Rosalie's, and others I have seen in Italy. She is of the saintly classique-perfectly seraphic." "You would not have thought so, Edward, if you had seen her as I did the other day." "How, Aunt, pray tell us."     &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7095-00000027"/> 53           THE REVEILLE: "Indeed, Edward, I don't care to tell of her behavior, for I am persuad- ed she does all these strange things on purpose to be talked about. Notori- ety is the great object of all these extravagant people. "You are very unfortunate, Madame, to have a pastor of that vein of ul- traism, it is a very incurable distemper, especially with persons of a clerical habit." "Ha, ha, you are always so witty," said the lady "but really I consider it a serious misfortune. One does not like to have the pure waters of the M sanctuary polluted by letting into them the turbid streams of common life;  but I hope it will be remedied soon; there is a great excitement just now in i the church; Mr. Mildmay has recently become very wild about temperance.:' "Actually," said the beau, "I think this temperance affair the most stu- pid of all their ultraisms-they would put an end to all good fellowship, and make a great outcry against drinking a harmless glass of wine-a most primeval custom-their rude irreverential shocks have jarred the sacred ves-  sels from the altar. But I had an idea, Madame, that the higher class of clergymen avoided these shocking desecrations of the pulpit."  "I wish you could have heard, then, the sermon Mtr. Mildmay gave us some sabbaths since, absolutely the most ranting expose of his temperance nania that could be imagined. But I could not give you the faintest idea of the trouble he has given us. Our society numbers some of the first peo- ple in the city. Now we have a number of rich wine merchants and whole- sale liquor dealers among our wealthiest and best men, and one of the Dea- cons, and a most worthy man too, is a rich distiller." "Al, indeed, and I suppose the temperance crusader flashes his temper- ance banner in their faces and cries, to arms, to arms! very shocking. I hope you mean to dismiss him forthwith." "We shall if we can," said the lady. "It has always been his aim to  enlist the common people on his side; he has quite a party in their ranks. The course he and his family have taken is this:-They have visited so- cially, but declined all fashionable parties; they have passed their time in study, exercise, and what they call parochial visiting. I suppose there is not a housemaid in the city that does not enjoy more pleasant recreations than Helen Mildmay, and I think it is a great mistake." "And how does the young lady like the regime herself?" said the beau. "Oh, she is delighted with these new things, and I suppose fancies her-  self one of the saints of the new era."  "Oh, no," said Edward, " that is not Helen Mildmay. She looks when \ I have seen her so wrapt in some delightful vision that she has forgotten herself entirely." "How extravagant, Edward; these Mildmays do go to weddings some-  times, and then Helen Mildmay"-                   : "Is the cynosure of the room," said Edward.  "No," said the lady, "I was going to say, then Helen made me think of  some stray pigeon that had got out of the dove cote, so shy and retiring; il but always graceful, I must confess."  "And will they be at Miss Russell's wedding to-night?" said the beau.    OR, OUR MUSIC AT DAWN.          5  "I cannot tell," said the lady, "Mr. Russell is very conservative, and he has an utter horror of the course our pastor is pursuing." "But, aunt," said the sofa lounger, "you have not told me yet where you saw her in such unpoetic plight." Sweeping out an old negro woman's dirty hut in the suburbs," said the lady, "her gown tucked up, her handkerchief tied about her head, and all flushed and excited. I rode out to engage a domestic 1 lad heard of, and as the coachman could not find this person, I left my carriage anld went into some of the cottages to make inquiries, and as I drew near one of the most dismal of these habitations, I saw Miss Mildmay engaged as I have said." "I should have been surprised to see any other- young lady of her class in such a situation, but in Miss Mildniay, it was precisely what one might expect. It may do very well for old ladies to be in such queer places, but for young ladies, it is hardly respectable. However I entered the hut and there lay a negro woman on a wretched bed, and three or four tattered children sprawling about on the floor." "Poor Nancy," said Helen, who Ipaused as I entered, and leaned wearily upon her broom; her husband is in jail with the delirium tremens, after a ter- rible fray with a watchman, and she is very ill of a fever." Why don't her own people come and take care of her," said I. "Because," said Helen with the greatest coolness," they think her fever is contagious." "Is it possible?" said I, "Oh, Miss Mildmay, why did you not tell me this when I first came in? You are quite beside yourself to risk 'your life by staying here another moment," so I left the young lady. She is a mere child, and her parents instead of teaching her better, encourage her to go about in this style. There is a sort of a reform school, a very low collec- tion of renegade cellar and garret scholars, she teaches. There is one Mary Woodliffe, who is quite a coadjutor of Miss Mildmay's in aiding to instruct this low, miserable class of beings. Now Helen is certainly a young lady, who with proper attention, might grace the higher circles, and how ridiculous for her to be figuring in that way. I should not wonder at all if I heard of her next, boarding some of the vessels with the sailor mis- sionaries." The servant just then announced Miss Hosmer, a belle of that time, one of the world's gay novices, just in the same petrifying process which lhad now so thoroughly ossified the heart of the older lady. The conversation turned upon the wedding. Miss Hosmer was very an- imated on the subject. "Do you know whther Mr. Mildmay will be the clergyman?" "No," said the young lady, "he is not in town. I have just left Mis Mildmay at the picture gallery. She told me her father was absent,- his brother was ill." "Ah," said the lady, "and that will defer the church meeting in relation to him, another month. We have been just speaking of Miss Mildmay,- had she as many reformed inebriates, and beggar charity scholars as usual?"  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7095-00000028"/> 52             THE REVEILLE: "I suppose so," said Miss Hosmer, "but do let me relate to you our con- versation together, it was so characteristic; Helen was sketching from some picture when we met. We were always intimate at school, and I asked her if she was going to the wedding. She said no, and mentioned her father's absence and its cause. I told her it was a shame she should not go, and then went on describing the superb arrangements for the wedding; the bride's dress, and the amount of the wedding jewels and presents. As 1 was very gaily talking, I observed a tear fall upon the sketches lying on her lap, and then another and another. I fear Helen, said I, all this is un- timely with you, and you are thinking about your uncle. No, said she sadly, I was thinking of the misery that all the money expended in display, would relieve. Cases of wretched poverty were before me, contrasting painfully with your splendid picture. Said I,- I admire charity, but this way of dwelling so much on scenes of distress, will make you a perfect mope.- For my part I do love a magnificent fete well got up. It is the poetry of life, my dear, and I do not think Christianity requires a renunciation of the elegant pleasures, and an incessant interloping and exploring Irish shanties and cellar homes. Why, said I, you might as well turn papist, do hard penance, and set up for a saint, as to lead such a life." "You were very eloquent, as you always are," said the beau, " but what said Miss Mildmay?" "Her strange reply was 'Christ's ways are ways of pleasantness.'" said Miss Hosmer.  His work makes me enjoy everything more. I don't ob. ject to parties, but to pride, luxury and selfishness. Is not the world's heart rich and o'erburthened with sin and sorrow, and ought not sympathy to check such revelry in selfish delight?" "Now, Helen," said I, " don't preach. Don't preach so with that bloom on your cheek, the very purple light of love itself, and that light in your eye. It is impossible you should not enjoy the elegant amusements suited to your age and taste. Is there not a little saintly pride here?" "I hope not," said she, " but you mistake me; I do enjoy amusements. There is music, I cannot tell you how I enjoy it; and drawing, and riding, and boating, and walking, and above all, the society of pleasant friends.- But God gives me higher pleasures than these, and I find them in the midst of those old shanties and wretched cellars, you speak of." "Just then Alfred Greenville came up and asked me to take a turn about the gallery with him, and so I left her, for I did not want to be persuaded into her extreme way of thinking." "Well, now," said Mrs. Grey, " in what bad taste is all this moralizing in such a public place as that gallery. Why could she not be a little in the gay humor of the place?" ' It must have been quite amusing," said the beau at the window, "to  see that immensely lovely child sermonizing in that style,- but you will be at the party, Miss Hosmer?"

CHAPTER     XII1. It was a cold, bitter winter's night; murky clouds were driven by fierce blasts across the sky. None of the gentle stars looked out through the dark chilling horrors of the night. Poverty, sin and death look more sternly in such hours. lan tfeels his nmortal doom press down his heart, and gaiety seems madness. 'Th'ere were " houses of joy in the city where the feast," the sonlg and dance went on, and the voice of the stornm was unheard; but as the wild win:ds swept through the almost deserted streets, the pinched child of poverty hovered more closely over the dying embers, and the poor invalid wrapt the tattered coverlid around him with shivering sensitiveness. There was a brawl that night in one of the low groggeries which received its supply of rum from the store of Singleton. The brawl was between two men and the man who kept the groggery. They had drank all they could pay for, and he refused to give them more. They swore and threat- ened, and a scuffle ensued, in which the sober rumseller having the advan- tage of his victims, finally succeeded in pushing both his drunken custom- ers headlong into the dark lane, and locking the door, the robber of souls counted his booty, and retired to his bed. Meantime, after wallowing about for a while, one of the men rose and reeled home to a wretched wife and family, to expend on them the rage roused within him--the other sat down, and leaned against the rickety shanty he had just been ejected from. The cold wind and snow drove in his face. By-and-by, after many struggles he succeeded in getting on his legs, and went tottering along.- He had nearly gained the head of the lane, when he came to some loose boards over the entrance into a cellar, when he pitched headlong. Being a large stout man, his weight broke through the boards, and in he tumbled among the bricks, sharp stones and loose rubbish of the deep old cellar.- The fall partially sobered him, but he was sadly bruised and wounded, and one of his legs broken. There he lay, till some watchmen, hearing his deep groans, came to his aid. They found him in a wretched condition.

They were red with the blood that oozed from various wounds. His once muscular limb now hung broken and powerless. They met but one person as they carried him along to his home, for they had discovered who he was. The person they met was a respectable lookiln man, muffled in a long cloak. He stopped and enquired who it was, they merely answered him, and hastily moved ol. The light was yet burning as they reached the house, for the widowed mother of the drunkard was still at work, for she toiled late and early to support herself and son, now her burthen; once her blessing, her support and her pride. There she sat, her once beautiful features pale and attenua- ted, her very heart at that moment sinking with fatal presentiments of the fate of her son. The low moans oft4he wounded, and the heavy tread of the men coming up to the door, drew ier attention. ii a moment came a loud knock. She hurrid to open the door, shading the lam!p) from the stern wind. She saw her son, and fell senseless to the floor. The watclJmt? having placed the sufferer on a bed, waited on the fainting mother, till she had recovered from the swoon. h'ley then left, promising to send a doc- tor. One of them slipped la quarter of a dollar into the widow's cold hand, remarking that if ever the devil had his d/ue, lie would have thiiem that had brought ttis trouble upon a woman lile her. "hey were fhitifulf in goillg for the doctor, but he hearing the case, though he did not tell them his co0n- elusion, decided it was not worth his while to turn out that bitter nightobr a poor drunken man. So there lay poor William Riverly, groaning in his misery all night. His mother while examining his wounds, became again so faint that she lay almost lifeless by him till morning. God then sent them a good Samaritan. Helen Mildmay in her morning walk stopped in to inquire, as she often did, how it was with the afflicted widow. Coming in, she found the room not in its wonted order. The lamp was burning in its socket; the fire was dead in the stove; the glittering frost clad the win- dows; the door of the bedroom within stood open; there lay the wretched victim of intemperance; his mother still faint, and occasionally swooning, lay by his side. Helen began applying cold water so successfully on Mrs. Riverly, that in a short time she was able to get up. Helen insisted on lighting the fire and preparing something for her friend's breakfast. That done, she put on her bonnet and soon returned with the doctor and Mary Woodliffe. Lucy Riverly had a certain feeling, I will not call it pride, for she was meekness itself; but it was delicacy and self-respect mingled with a dread of causing any reflection on her son, which had always made her shrink from asking aid. She seemed to shun any inquiry into her wants, prefer- ring as long as possible to sustain herself. But now, when Mary saw how empty her closet was, how few and scanty her stores, she sat dowh and wept. "I have had a few dollars for you for some time," said Helen, "but was afraid to give them to you for fear I might hurt your feelings." *Perhaps I have been shy,' said Mrs. Riverly, "I hope never ungratefil; : *? ,;   OR, OUR MUSIC A" DAWN.         5 no, you both look to me like angels.

But, alas, my fears are realized: there lies my poor boy! The rmn destroyer has laid him low ; the blow has come, so long dreaded. I thank you, dear friends, for all this kindness now, when that bed, that mangled body, take up all I have left of thought and feelinlls." 'The two friends pllaced the room in ample orler. Helen gladly took the opportunity to supply the little pantry bountifillyx. They remained with her as long as other duties would allow, but at length took leave. "Try to look through this darkness," said Mary, in parting, "there is light beyond." C H APTER    X IV. A PLOT DISCOVERED. "And have ye heard what happened poor Riverly," said Patrick Shan- loll to Miss Jenny Brown, as he sat making some ladders for her flower pots. "No I have not," said Miss Jenny, "nothing good of course since he . broke the pledge, and with it his mother's heart." "Blt sure we should have charity, saving your prisence Miss Jenny, ye remember 'twas not himself entirely that's done it-he's a poor sight now any way--'tis thim that's got the twinty dollars, the price of his poor soul should take the blame, Miss Jenny, as they will in a day that's long a com- ing, but not a bit less sure for all that, Miss Jenny." "But do tell me what has happened," said Miss Jenny. "He's a lying there at home," said Pat, "the greatest ruin of a man, ever my sight saw, all bruised and broken, and his poor mother, the color of death watching over him. 'Tis myself has just been in to offer hilp, and sure she's a thousand welcomes to the little I could do the crathure! He that begun that bad work, is the same what helped to finish it. That grog shop where they turned poor Riverly out that bitter night,-Heaven save us, not a drop of rum in it but it comes from Singleton's, and the brute that keeps it is Luke Brady, Singleton's wife's first cousin, a big rip of a man who loves a brawl better nor his bread and butter. 'Twas the Lord's will that the finisher of that murther should be the beginner-that same Single- ton. But they're not content yet, these murthering villains, for wait till I tell ye. Sure haven't ye heard about one Rockheart and Jerry Woodliffe." Yes I have heard of that affair," said Miss Jenny.  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7095-00000030"/> "Ah! that's the fine hearted woman. Mrs. Woodliffe. Many's the good turn she does-and when Mrs. Sealove told me how she bothered Rock- heart's plotting to ruin her husband-good on her head, says I; may she live to see the last barrel of rum rolling down the street, with its bung out on the under side. Ye won't let on Miss Jenny, if I tell ye a great secret.' "Certainly not, did I ever betray your confidence, Pat?" said Jenny. "In troth Miss Jenny, I'd be asy to trust ye as a Father Confessor him- self-how do you like that ladder?" "Very neat Patrick." "I was down on the street, late one night, and coming into the yard soft- ly not to waken the wife and little ones, I heard the sound of two voices over in Ready's yard. The thought of poor Riverly was burning inside of me. Is it more mischief you're plotting, ye thaves of the world! Thin it's Patrick Shannon will prick up his ears till he hears ye. I felt weak, and through others, jest to hear them, ye may believe me Miss Jenny, on my soul, Jim Ready swore by the blackest oaths, Heaven save us, that he would have Jerry Woodliffe drunk, if he raised the dead to do it. Rockheart and Stronghead said money was not the least consideration, if they could bate down this temperance. Ah! the viper, the blackguard. I'm trimbling to tell ye. Faith it's too bad, intirely." "No, no, let 4s have the whole," said Miss Jenny. Thin what did Jim Ready do but swear dreadfully, as I'm a living man  and Patrick Shannon, and no ither, that if Mr. Mildinay did'nt be after lay- in the place, he'd fix him. If it had been the praste himself, 'twould have made no difference in the way I felt-my faith, 'twas a nare thing to me. It was jist myself could hardly hould myself; but says I in a minute, Pat- rick Shannon, it is better for you to walk into your own house. Mr. Mild- may, may the good light of Heaven never lave him; 'tis himself that has done the good turns for me many's the time, and will I be hearing the like of thim vagabonds?" You need not be concerned, what they say about Mr. Mildmay, is all bluster, he is so much respected and beloved, they dare not touch a hair of his head, But I do not feel so easy about Jerry Woodliffe. These reform- ed inebriates want a deal of watchful care," said Miss Jenny. "As much nor an infant," said Pat, with a sympathetic expression. "I think his wife ought to have a hint to be on the lookout. Had you not better give her a hint, Patrick?" "I am very poor at hinting a thing Miss Jenny. Mrs. Woodliffe would be after querying me round, till she picked it all out of me, as clane as a squirrel the mate of a nut. Patrick Shannon is'nt the man that's able to refuse the likes of her if she axed to know a thing." "I am going to Mrs. Sealove's this afternoon, are you willing I should tell her to give Mrs. Woodliffe a hint?" said Miss Jenny. "To be shure I am, only don't let on where ye've hearn it, bekase Jim Ready would be after bating the brith out of me, and the ould woman is skittish already," said Patrick, "You may depend Oq me," said Miss Jenny o   OR, OUR MUSIC AT DAWN.          57 "You are a wise woman, Miss Jenny, and any one may depind on youl, good for him that shall call yez wife. Miss Jenny here's the ladders, as fine as ye could wish to see. Ah! 'tis a poor thing, Miss Jenny, has happened to poor Riverly ;" and so saying, Patrick Shannon went his way. That afternoon Mrs. Sealove sat in her comfortable parlor, awaiting a visit from her friend, Miss Jenny Brown. Tlhe room displayed tokens of the captain's sea-faring life, in vast India fans, rice, tea-caddies, and China pagodas and images, over the mantle-piece. The old-fashioned beaufet displayed through the door some very rich old china. A globe of gold fish stood on the table. A very beautiful parrot occupied a fancy cage ill one corner. A very well drawn likeness of Captain Sealove; hung in one recess one side of the fire-place, his good ship at his side as the emblem of his pro- fession. A picture of Mrs. Sealove, drawn by the same artist, hung in the recess on the other side. The frank and noble features of the hardy intelli- gent seaman, 'rough but kindly,' and the cordial, motherly expression in the face of Mrs. Sealove, were still the same as at the much more youthful period, when these pictures were taken. The outlines had become more full, but in place of these had come the placid sweetness given by the Christian's hope and the Christian's love. Mrs. Sealove, in order the better to enjoy a sociable chat, had laid aside all other occupation but her knitting. The two friends were extremely entertaining, having both a faculty of obtaining by the best advices, all the news il circulation, with quite a racy talent for comment. The good lady was full that afternoon, for the second church meeting on the Mildmay case had taken place on the. previous evening. So as soon as Miss Jenny was fairly seated, Mrs. Sealove began- "You were not at the church meeting, Miss Jenny." "No," said Miss Jenny, " company came in and prevented me. Do tell me how it went off. Is Mr. Mildmay dismissed?" "It is a singular thing with you, Miss Jenny, that you always want to hear the last of a story first," said Mrs. Sealove. "Why, the last of the story is the cream of it, and that always comes off first." "Well said," replied Mrs. Sealove, "but I like to begin at the beginning. I don't like to tell a story or read a book, as witches do the Bible, back- wards. I suppose you know, Miss Jenny, that ever since last church meet- ing, Bigland and that set have tried to move heaven and earth, to get Mr. Mildmay away." "To be sure they have," said Miss Jenny, " and I almost wish there had been no temperance reformation, if it's going to send off our ministers." "That's selfish, Miss Jenny; had you rather all these poor drunkards should be lost, that you might have a good time Sundays, hearing Mr. Mildmay?" "I am very much afraid," said Miss Jenny, "that they won't be saved af- ter all. I keep hearing of one and another going back to their old ways. By the waywhen you see Mary Woodliffe, tell her to look out for her hlls- band ; he is a marked man." S  I,   &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7095-00000031"/> TIHE REVEILLE : "What have you heard ?" asked Mrs. Sealove. "Just tell her that, Mrs. Sealove.  Of course, I know a great deal more than I choose to tell, but as I was saying, I have not much faith in these reformed inebriates. A drunkard is a drunkard, after all, and it's like pul- ling brands out of the fire, to try to save them.  There's plenty of decent people need converting, without diving into gutters to pick up such off- scourings." " Why, what are you thinking of, Miss Jenny Brown ? Hasn't the Lord told us to go out into the highways and hedges ?  He was not too nice to pick up such, and why should we be ? But this is not my story. I kept hearing this way, and that way about Mr. Mildmay.  Mrs. Bigland was where I was one day, and talking about the matter, she said that Mr. Mildmay and his wife had always made a disturbance wherever they had been; that they never stayed long anywhere, and if it had not been the temperance cause, it would have been something else. She said, too, she thought the church would be better off without him.  It was in sister Gould's back shop, this talk was. Now you know Mrs. Bigland feels too large to talk with me, and all she said did not start me, till she and sis- ter Gould got along in deeper, and said that the Mildmay's were an ex- travagant family, and that our minister spent more than his salary every year; that they had a piano forte, and hired the best masters for their chil- dren ; and where did all this come from; who had got to pay for it ? Why the church to be sure. This was a little too much. _ Mr. Mildmay, said I, has a good salary, though no ways beyond his deserts, and he spares in oth- er things, that he may spend in giving his children an education. But that talk is only a little kind of sample of what has been going on.  The Cap- tain says they have made Mr. Mildmay out anything but a good man." "He does not seem to mind it, said Miss Jncony.  He has preached like an angel, and the church has been jammed full every time." "That's what I am going to say," said Mrs. Sealove, "the more they have talked against him, the more have the people flocked to hear him.- But I must tell you about the church meeting, for something took place there all unexpected. It will make a great stir, and I wonder you had not heard it; but I see you have not.  The opposition party had worked hard and was out in such force, I thought they certainly would have it all their own way, and so they would, but for this wonderful thing I am going to tell you, which coming like a sudden clap of thunder, threw all the enemy's camp into confusion. I looked at Deacon Stillworm when he came in, and I kept a looking at him. He looked kind of mellow and soft, different from what he ever did before, and Mrs. Stillworm looked altogether different.- He rose to speak soon after the meeting opened, and she made none of her kind of sly motions I've seen her do oft-times, to keep him from speaking. she looked all another way from what I ever saw her, so feeling like. He rose, and as soon as he began to speak the first word, the tears sprung to his eyes. It made me think of the waters that gushed out when Moses struck the flinty rock.' 'Brethren and sisters,' said he, 'I have not come here to join in putting down brother Mildmnay, but to confess to him, and to you, as I   have already to One who knows all tilings, that I have been the chief ol sinners.' Now every eye was fixed upon him.  He went on: 'A deacon of the church, yet a rumseller, a betrayer of souls. You all look in wonder upon me. You wonder what has brought me to this; let me tell you.- Ever since the temperance reform began here, I have covered np a hell in my own heart, I had just religion enough to see clearly that I was in the sight of God, a covetous soul murderer; but I loved to count tup and add to my ill-gotten gains so well, that I could not give up to God. I had round me those who stirred me up to fight against temperance, and braced up my failing courage. I strove against light, till I got fully excited to do all the evil I could. Ilut one evening lately, I was with some of my associates.- They were rejoicing in their having made some of the reformed inebriates drunk. They spoke particularly of poor William Riverly, told of his mad pranks on voting day. and laughed to think how dr:nkl he was. I felt slick at the talk, foi I was acquainted with sister Riverly.  She had beens very kind to me in a contagious fever, when nobody else came nigh me but my own family. It was late, they went on cracking jokes and telling one story and another to ridicule the temperance folks, and finally I took up my hat to go home. I left in a state of feeling that I cannot describe.  It was a cold night, and quite late, and I walked along fast through the driv- ing storm, As I went on, I saw some watchmen carrying along on a sort of litter, a poor wounded wretch, who seemed to be groaning in dreadful misery. They did not know me, and I asked vwho the man was.  They told me it was poor William Riverly, and how they found him, and went on. I was struck dumb with horror.  I felt as if I wished the earth woul d open and swallow me up from the eye of God. I remembered that the moth- er of the poor lad had tended me in that fever; it rolled upon me like fire. 1 kftni down n the w t snw drift tand vowdr to  d I winld ell no m-re rum. I felt better when I got up; yes, though I am the chief of sinners I was heard. I went to see sister Riverly. The sight of the ruin I Ilad made almost drove me to despair; but she whom I had wronged prayed for a poor wretch like me, and again I felt that there is pardon for the vilest." "That is the substance of what Deacon Stillworm said about his new conversion; but after that he talked most beautifully to brother Mildmay, and. thanked him for his faithfulness, and hoped he would do as he always had done,-'I tell you, there were a great many blank looking faces when all this came out. It just upset the opposition folks. It was grand to see the whole plot blown up. The captain says he wishes he was as sure his next voyage would be a good one, as he is that our church will continue Mr. Mildmay as our minister. So Miss Jenny, what do you say now to the temperance reformation ? " " One year from this time," said the persistent Miss Jenny, "I will an- swer your question."  Miss Jenny, however, really valued her minister, so she added, " but I wish I felt as sure as you do,. that Mr. Mildmay would remain. There are people among us not to be cinquered so easy as that." "Dear me, Miss Jenny," said Mrs. Sealove, "what a damper you always put on a body. The Captain says it- is always best to look upon the bright  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7095-00000032"/> ti            THE REVEILLE: side, while there is a bright side. But was that not a wonderful thing,- Stillworm's meeting poor Mildmay; and was it not all very remarkable?" "i Yes," said Miss Jenny, "it was a very remarkable occurrence; only let us hope that he won't go to distilling again, when this temperance work gets to be an old story." "That he never will," said Mrs. Sealove, "for the temperance work will go on and prosper, and never will be an old story,- no more than the gos- -el, of which it is part. But do look, Miss Jenny, there goes Miss Helen Mildmay. with a basket on her arm, going to see some poor family." "I 'd warrant it," said Miss Jenny, "the Mildmays carry their charities too far,-people remark upon it. I heard Cora Moore say, that 6ministers' folks were to receive gifts, not to give."' "There now; do please Miss Jenny, stop right there. I don't want to hear any more of Cora Moore's talk. It sounds too exactly like her.- The Captain says he 'd rather be an old salt aboard a man-of-war's man, with fifty green middies to haul him round, than be in a minister's place, the way some folks treat them." A pause ensued,--Miss Jenny looking red, and knitting fast. "Why don't you talk, Miss Jenny?" said Mrs. Sealove. "If I cannot talk what I wish to, I had as lief sit still." "Miss Jenny Brown, you are not angry are you?" asked Mrs. Sealove pushing up her spectacles, and looking upon her with a pleasant smile,- "I broke in upon you too quick; you must excuse ne."  "Certainly,- though I must confess I did not think it civil," answered Miss Jenny. "That's just like me, Miss Jenny. The Captain often says I am as quick as a flash of lightning in a summer day, when a body is n't looking for it. But I am calm now, and you must overlook it." "Then I suppose you will let me tell you what Cora Moore said?" said the persevering Miss Jenny. "I suppose I can hear it, though Cora Moore never said anything yet that was worth repeating. "Well," said Miss Jenny, blushing again, " if you don't wish to hear it, then." "Oh, yes, do go on, I am all attention." "She went on to say," continued Miss Jenny, "that besides' giving away what was not their own, they visited the poor of the church oftener than the rich." "That's a pretty fault to find with a Christian minister; how did she manage to pick any wrong out of that?" "Why," said Miss Jenny, "she said all the reason they did so, was be- cause they wanted to be looked up to, and they would be thought great things of among the poorer sort; but people who were as good as they i would not listen to them, nor be led round by their queer ways."  "Queer ways,--what queer ways, pray?" asked Mrs. Sealove. "She said they bathed every day." "Would she have them go dirty? The Captain says, secret dirt is se- cret sin," said Mrs. Sealove. r '^ r hi   on, OUR MUSIC AT DAWN.          61 ,i She said," continued Miss Jenny, "l that they did not eat like other folks, but coarse bran bread, cracked wheat, and such messes." "I suppose she eats what she likes, and she ought to let other folks have the same liberty. She cannot say but what they have reared up a likely family: any way. Where is there a finer looking girl of sixteen, than Hel- en Mildmay?" "Oh, she came out upon her worse than all the rest," replied Miss Jenny. "She says she can't bear the sight of her, she is so odd from other people, always fill of books and paupers; and as for beauty, she looks like a milk- maid,- no air of fashion at all. Nobody would ever have her,- she was cut out for an old maid. t said, ' for one so young she did a great deal of good.' ' Poh,' said she, ' I don't see what great good she does.'  "She don't see," said Mrs. Sealove, "Well, Helen Mildmay won't wor- ry if she don't sec. She is the sweetest young Christian I ever saw. It does me good to see her face, so full of peace and love. The Captain loves music, you know, best of most anything. He says she makes him think of a good music-book; you think the first piece you see is good music,- you turn over a leaf and find a new piece, as good, or better; and so on another and another. Just so, he says, you see Helen Mildmay. I tell you she is a great favorite with the Captain, and he has been about the world and seen young women enough to be a better judge than Cora Moore. I suppose you know what made her so spiteful?" "This Temperance question, I suppose," answered Miss Jenny. "I see you don't know," said Mrs. Sealove, ' and I'll tell you. Mr. Moore's nephew, young Grey, likes Miss Helen Mildmay, but she does not smile upon him." 'Then she is a very foolish girl, and stands very much in her own light. He is the handsomest young man about, and such a family." "You know, Miss Jenny, he's very gay and fashionable, and the captain says, he has no more notion of real religion than an up-country green hand, of the rigging of a ship. Now Helen Mildmay would n't have him if he was as handsome as a pink, and strung with diamonds from top to toe, if he was not good. I'll tell you what she said herself, when I talked to her about it. 'Oh, dear, mother Sealove,' said she, 'I am too young for all that, but if ever I do love anybody, it must be a good real Christian,- one who is humble enough for every good work. Is Edward Grey such a one?' So I said no more, for when the babes show less worldliness than we older ones, I think it is time to be silent." "Oh, la! I suppose then," said Miss Jenny, " she will marry some min- ister or lecturer, and be as poor as a church mouse all her days. Dear me, if everybody stood for goodness, there would be more old maids than there are now." "Well they had better stand as thick as pins in a row, than for a good Christian girl to cumber her way upward by tying herself to a rich gay worldling." "She is so good, she might convert him," said Miss Jenny. ( It would be a poor step to it, to marry for money against her princi- ples," said Mrs. Sealove.  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7095-00000033"/> 62            fftE PfVFtfLE I ' I think it is good to have a religious husband, but if yout cannot find I such an one, have the husband at any rate," said Miss Jenny. (I suppose that's like the man who told his son, "get money honestly if you can, but at any rate get money." "1 think," said Miss Jenny, rather piqued, "I am sufficiently particular,  if I had not been so, I should not be Miss Jenny Brown to-day, but there is such a thing as carrying our ideas too far, and I think Mrs. Sealove, that is your besetting sin--carrying things too far. It takes good common sense to regulate everything." Mrs. Sealove, received the compliment to her good sense implied in tie latter part of this speech, with her wonted good nature, and the captain en- tering at this juncture, a new turn was given to the discourse, which, as it had no particular reference to our story, we forbear to chronicle. C HAPTER XV. The next morning after the church meeting there was one of those spontane- ous meetings of the Rum Club, which always took place on the occasion of every new excitement connected with the temperance movement. In their trouble they turned unto their god, Stronghead, who by his wealth, influ- ence, and natural power of mind, had acquired great sway over them.-  Very early in the morning, before the usual business hours, the confederates I met in his counting room. It was a pity, while looking at the golden tint-  ed sea and amethyst and sapphire sky, to see these men pass on inhaling the holy breath of morn, as they went to such a rendezvous. Yet so it is, the sweet teaching of nature is all unheeded, and when beneath the awful  canopy of this most solemn temple her voice says " praise ye the Lord," then, even then, man destroys his fellow man, and the groans of death and hell mingle with the heaven-breathing harmonies of nature's ceaseless wor- ship. In the midst of clouds of tobacco smoke, the favorite incense of the Rum-God, sat the worthies. There was Singleton-yes Singleton, after! that bitter confession made the evening previous by his former fast friend  and ally. We have said that ever since Singleton sold himself to the vile scheme of overthrowing -the temperance reform by destroying the fidelity of the reformed drunkards to their Washingtonian pledge, the mask which had so long hid him from himself had fallen off, and he was no longer blind to his own character, no longer self-deluded with the idea that he was a Christian: It was in this state of mind that he had attended the late church meeting. In any other stage of sin, which had now crept through the whole ,   OR, OUR MUSIC AT DAWN.          63 inner man, Singleton might have been reached by the confession of Deacon Stillworm, but though that confession astounded him it did not convict him. The mighty empire of darkness yielded not within him. But it was iln- possible that such an event should be without some effect. If it did not convict, it would be sure to harden a similar offender and from the moment that the legitimate influence of that confession was repelled, Singleton felt a hardness against the very gospel and its grace, unknown to him before in his worst moments. He discerned its thorough opposition to his unholy cov- etousness. He saw that man's strong agony but did not want to let go his sin, and for the first time he wished the gospel was a delusion. In this condi- tion of soul, came Singleton to his associates. Here he found the rest as- sembled. Rockheart, with his usual stolid, adamantine look, but blacker and more frowning than usual, though he always carried such a gloomy, murky mark in his forehead, that did we not learn from holy writ that Cain's descendants perished in the flood, we might suppose him a lineal descen- dant of the first murderer. Stronghead appeared as usual, cheerful, self- pessessed, and self-reliant. Ready sat smoking furiously, thinking some- times of the Deacon, sometimes of a boxing match soon to come off. Har- ry Wood was full of consequence and importance as usual. "Singleton," said Stronghead, "what in the name of common sense has Deacon Stillworm been doing; I hear he made a fine show up of himself last evening? So tell us what the miserable old fool has been doing." "I was never more astonished in my whole life," said Singleton, "than when the Deacon spoke in that manner. I expected of course, when he arose, it was to condemn Mildmay." "That his wife would not let him do," said Harry Wood. Her con- founded petticoat government has driven the poor old fool as crazy as bed- lam; but I guess madam will have to give up some of her flurs and fur- belows if the Deacon gives up distilling." "That's the way with some women," said Singleton, "they want money, Oh, they must have money, but they make up their mouth at the way their husbands have to get it." "But that isn't like your wife, Singleton," said Ready, whose late strange intimacy with Singleton had ed him to see with great admiration, the entire submission of his wife. "She is too tame, I should not want a woman that would not give-me an excuse to break her head, or give her a thrash- ing sometimes." "Will Stiliworm sell his distillery," said Stronghead, "Singleton, Rock- heart and I had been talking before you came in, of buying it." "Oh," said Singleton, 'he was asked that question before he left the meeting house, last night, but he had thought it all over, and had his an- swer ready." "The Deacon is cool, after all," said Stronghead. "He said," continued Singleton, "he should wait and see if Mildmay was turned out of his church, and if he was, he would make a temperance meet- ing house of it, if otherwise, he should throw it into tenements and stores. He said he would rather tear it down, than ever have it used for distilling again." ....  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7095-00000034"/> "Then lie has gone stark mad." said Stronghead, "we may give up our  plans, Rockheart." "I will tell you what I think," said Rockheart, "if he waits for Mildmay, or anything else, he will go to distilling again; this fit of the blues will blow over; religious folks are apt to have such turns, but if they aint fools they get over them. What was it all, Mr. Singleton?" "Oh," said Singleton, "lie happened to be passing when the watchmen were carrying Riverly home the night he got hurt, and he said it was that  convicted him of the sil of rumselling." "Ha, ha," said Stronghead, "too rich. Ha! ha, ha, ha," said they all. "Capital good joke," continued Stronghead, "Deacon Stillworm who has been distilling these twenty years, and made a fortune by it, struck under conviction because he sees that drunken scamp, Will Riverly carried home maimed ; why he might have been convicted most any time the last twenty years, if a thing like that could do it, but he has waited till his purse got full of gold, ha, ha. Riverly has been a drunkard for a long time, and so was his father before him, and what's the great fuss about him. But I have remarked that the Deacon has been offish ever since this temperance busi- ness came up; he's been shaking in the wind, his wife, poor man, is such a piece, I suppose he had no rest day or night till she brought him down. You do not feel any notion of backing out, do you Singleton? I think not, your fees are pretty good about this time." "No," said Singleton, "I am determined to see this battle out; I should not give up my rights because temperance folks say I must."   i.- "Spunky for you, my dear fellow," said Stronghead, "the Deac6n's de- fection has done some good, it has given you more pluck than I thought you had; here, give me your hand, stick to it Singleton, we are in a free country and have the right to do what we please." "Any new pigeons to pluck," said Rockheart, with a wink, to Ready. "No tales out of school," said Ready, "there's a couple of them in view, but they are hard to catch; there's a trap baited fo(r a green one, his wings  will be plucked ere long. That old Deacon is a base old rascal, 1 should like to dust his old jacket for him. But if he does turn that distillery into a meeting house for Mildmay, I will serve him a worse turn still; the boys * will all help, too." "Don't get too riley," said Wood, for Ready now began to swear him- self into a fearful passion, "this temperance fuss is tapering off; there are two of their pledged men come every day to my shop for soda and segars, and when it domes to that, I can soon bring them on to something else. You see everything looks inviting, and all the equipments are in the top of the style. I notice, Mr. Stronghead, this reform is almost entirely confined to the middle and poorer classes." "I have observed that," said Stronghead, " not one of my really aristo- cratic customers have fallen off." "Well," replied the other, " it is they who, after all, give the tone to society. Everybody wants to be genteel, and they will all imitate the  aristocracy; till they are reached, there is no danger." -q.   OR, OUR MUSIC AT DAWN.         60 Here Ready interposed with a great oath, sending the "Rustycrats to ten thousand perditions. "I don't care,--some folks thought it was of mighty consequence what the    rustycrats did; for my part, I don't care a ninepence; I'll trip up the biggest on them in the street, and ask no odds of them." "After he had blown out, Wood said,--- "I do not hold myself an under- ling of the aristocracy any more than yourself, Mr. Ready. I am an inde- pendent American, and sustaining every day in my own shop, by every glass of liquor I sell, my patriotic right to act my own pleasure, regardless of any one. I was mentioning the fact of their influence being great, and that influence being against th3 Temperance reform. I was going on to say, that Mr. Mildmay was one of their top leaders, and beside him, they had, as yet, few professional men. Mildmay, you all know, is one alone by himself in everything; his being so popular a minister bears hard on our cause." "I have heard him twice"' said Ready, " and he lies faster than a horse can trot. Popular, indeed; I should like to give him a popular drag-out, and then hang him up in front of his own pulpit for a terror to all the rest of the hypocritical blackguards. I've told Singleton I would not stay in a church where he was minister, lording it as he does, for half an hour." "Gentlemen," said Rockheart, "   we seem to be talking at random. I have but little time this morning, and I came here to consult. Here's an old distiller backing out, and he will be going round with his confession,- it will work against us like . Stronghead, you are the main spring; what's the counter movement?" "I have nothing further to suggest," said Stronghead, " only what I have always said, we must show the futility of this temperance work, by getting their converts publicly drunk. I hope and believe there are no more pusil- lanimous ones among us, now Stillworm is gone; we must not let our feel- ings interfere; there is only one common sense way, and that way we must take, and not flinch for feelings. It is not very pleasant to throw in bomb shells, and burn up women and babes alive, but it is done for the sake of rights,--and we too, must get these reformed men drunk, if it is not pleas- ant, or have our sacred rights taken from us, and we have as much right to do so as others have to burn women and babes. Then as I have often said there will be drunkards as long as the world lasts. We are in the rumsclling business, and we have a right to follow it; nor will we be driven off our stands, for others to take our places. We have' no cause to be at all dis- couraged.; our friends Singleton and Ready, have done well, and ought to be paid well, if we mean they should go on. Here's Mr. Wood and my- self know that none of our dons countenance this temperance Washingto- nian movement. We are not going to flinch a bit, because a canting, praying old dotard, (I ask your pardon, Mr. Singleton,) has gone out of the camp. I am glad he has; he was always too milk and waterish for me. I want to see a man either one thing or another,- a healthy sinner is better than a sickly saint." Stronghead," said Ready, "I hope you'll be a gineral, and if ever you  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7095-00000035"/> "            THE REVEILLE' be, I want to fight under you, because yoll know more than five common men." "; You are right! you are right, Ready," said they all.      i "We must resolve ourselves into a comlmittee of the whole," Strong- head remarked, " and work without fear or favor; then we sha!l compns. : our ends. Ready, my brave, you must be prudent. Singleton is an excel- lent check-mate for you; your fire and his prudence workl well together,.-- It is now time for us to part." And thus ended the sessi'on of the Rum Club, C It A ' TE R  X V  . THE PARTNERS. Singleton and Ready tmay now be considered as an acknowledged firm i- Im villainy. They were, indeed, naturally at the opposite extreme of Sa- - tan's corps. Singleton, sly, smooth, but full of subtilty. Ready, a fine, i: gay, smooth-faced villain. Ready defied law ; Singleton evaded it. Ready cared nothing at all about religion ; the only way in which he ever used or  thought of any of those awful words which represent to the mind the most sublime truths of religion, was to make blasphemous his frightful oaths. Singleton, whose low, erroneous ideas of Christianity and its au- thor, were framed out of the deceits of his own heart, and whose extreme \ selfishness; caution and foresight, made him look out for his future hereafter as well as here, had easily, at a former period of life, persuaded himself in- to the belief that he was a Christian, and hugged himself into the belief that he was safe, let who would be lost. No Catholic ever identified sal- vation with church-membership more closely than he; forgetting that church-membership is but an improved means of grace, and only efficacious in proportion to the purity of the church and the sanctity of its leaders,-- but this idea, tiough erroneous, made Singleton indefatigable in all the out- ward duties of a church member. His plausible. supple manner passed for humility with the superficial, and for many years, while he was yet obscure and poor, few in the church were disposed to criticise our- steady, humble  brother Singleton, as they called him. His master passion was a love of  gain, although other vices lay latent, ready to spring forth in their time.-- As avarice is a decent sort of vice, and much countenanced, and he regular- ly paid his church dues, this -vice properly concealed, was not very much in  his way. There was a time, however, when his own sister, dying in a i   ORn, OUR MUSIC AT DAWN .         6I7 very needy and destitute condition in an obscure part of the city, tlere wcere some loudly whispered censures of his unfeeling neglect. But Singleton had now become a man of somle consequenlce, and no one openly rebulked him. As he came on in life, meek as he seemed, he inspircd fear. We fear the sting of the serpent, though the reptile crawls. His vice being not openly against society could develope itself unhindered till it had eaten like a canker, his better nature, and finally made him what we have seen him, so long had he gone on, deceiving and being deceived: Ready, on the other hand, had always gloried in open and avowed wickedness. The son of a professed bully and brothel keeper, what could be expected of him. Yet, after all, Singleton and Ready were alilke; good beings, though different, have a family likeness to one another, and so h-ave evil beings to one anoth- er, it is the same evil principle in the tiger, -as in the rattlesnake. They were now strongly united in one nefarious conspiracy to put down the tem- perance reform, for which they were better qualified than their compeers, as the one possessed extreme subtility, the other extreme daring. Ready's domestic circumstances were different from Singletonl's. Ready, who went for the largest liberty, lived on very easy and defiant temls with society, as to his domestic relations. Singleton's domestic history was brief- ly this. His first wife was a simple-hearted, religious woman, and her ac- quaintance with him commenced in the religious intercourse of the church. in their social and other meetings; here Singleton always appeared his best. First impressions are great things in these matters, and when riarrying him, ; his wife believed she was uniting herself to a true Christian, and a man of most meek and pleasant temper. One week after' marriage, finished this apologue of her fancy forever. She henceforth knew him only as her -taskmaster and her tyrant. Subtle in this, as in all else, he always called her my dear, even when he was making the iron of his tyranny enter into her soul. Before people, he was always more than usually kind. But alone, he dropped the maslk, yet the same set smile was upon his face, when he issued his most imperious orders, that she lhad sat and admired in confer- ence meeting, and solaced herself with the thought that this was the sign of his inward peace and lave, and what a gentle, holy master she should have. She now: saw inrthat very smile the index of his secret malignity. She soon became afraid of him, so afraid, that she dared not hlave a colnfidante. Hard work, hard, heartless usage, hard fare, and nobody to complain to, soon ended her days-. She died after -being a another for a few weles, for Want of the comforts and care necessary to her condition. Her nurse was dismissed in a week, as Singleton made so many secret complaints to his wife against her wastefulness, awkardness and uselessness, that she felt com- pelled to dismiss her. He said he could take care of her; and under his care, in two weeks, she and her babe were in that land where the weary rest. Reader, this is not too much to believe; facts warrant the picture. Then Singleton, after Mary Woodliffe in her girlish days refilsed him, hired a housemaid of mnixed Irish and Yankee descent, whom he finally conclulded to marry, because he found her obsequious, and likely to prove an obh.  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7095-00000036"/> dient vassal. Her Hibernian sturdiness of constitution, was also much -in her favor, with-one who calculated as closely the value of her household services, as a slaveholder when purchasing a slave. She had not disap- pointed his calculations. She fayed in with his system exactly. She caught his love of filthy lucre, and though he never for a moment relaxed the austerity of his conjugal discipline, yet this severity was superflous, so entire was his wife's submission, up to the time of the memorable church- meeting confession of Deacon Stillworm. Singleton had believed himself a believer, nor had he wished to doubt a system in which he believed his own salvation secured. But now, when he saw by the light of that man's experience, that Christianity was not the accommodating scheme he had fancied it, and that he must choose between God and Mammon, his first de- sire to doubt revelation occurred among the gloomy, angry tossings of his passions. It was soon suggested to him by the evil spirit, who now swayed his mind that there were many wiser men than himself, who were Infidels, and had written books about Infidelity.' He did not throw up his church connexions; he was tod subtle for that; he still saw the value of church- relationship, in regard to good social standing, and Singleton had not that element of defiant independence which made so integral a part of Ready's character, consequently he must become very insensible and brutish, or very hardened in wickedness, before he lost his sensitiveness to public opinion. But the last restraint havihg passed from his conscience, and emboldened by his rumsclling friend, he now frequently sold liquor by the glass, though for decency's sake, he did not keep a bar. About' this time, Singleton was i able to go more largely into business. By foreclosing a mortgage on the homestead of a man who had secretly bought rum of him for many years, he had obtained possession of a large, roomy house which he resolved to make his dwelling and business stand, throwing a part of it into a spacious, handsome hall for public entertainment, dancing and similar purposes. He -saw with no other feeling than mean exultation and selfish complacency ; the widow of the drunkard who had first indulged in secret inebriety under his shadow, ejected from the comfortable home once her own. He seized her most valuable moveables for debt, and as the man who has injured us never forgives us, he was well pleased to see her while he was removing into the mansion, once her own, crowded with a large orphan family into a garret tenement to earn as she could their daily bread. Well has the Savior said, "beware of covetousness." Yes, because licen- tiousness itself is not more hardening. This was a greater coming out in the service of the evil one than Singleton had ever before been equal to.- As he got versed in his new lore, he began to talk, circumspectly still, but in this way, among his intimates. He would remark, that for his part, he did not see but that all men were very much alike; they were all for get- ting money, how they could, and where they could, Christians and all.- There was Deacon Goldmar, a leading man in one of the churches, and a temperance man, in the jewelry business. There was Brother Root, too, the tobacconist; nobody found specks in him. There were ever so many good Christian 'hen, engaged in the factory business, black slavery one pil- ,   lar of it, and white slavery the other; but nothing was bad, only the rum business. Men might sell each other, and work each other to death, and be very nice Christians all the while. Rumselling alone was wickedness.- For his part, he did not see why it was any worse than any other trade; and he did n't see much difference in men. This was all new talk for Sin- gleton, and sounded rather philanthropic, but the trail of the serpent was over it all, the same slime of selfishness, that was formerly in his conference harangues, the same superficial show of good, the same real leaven of the Pharisees. But anyhow, Singleton was a rising snob in the world, instead of the obscure, servile sneak, he had once been. His new hall was finished, and was soon to be opened, on the occasion of the anniversary of Engine Company, No.--, when it was to be the scene of their festival supper, after the year's election of their officers, at their club-rooms. There is a strong belief in guardian angels, and it is warranted by Holy Writ; but there are those who are guardian angels to us, yet in the body, and also those who exercise an evil influence over us. Besides this, spirits of other nature than man's, have entered into human beings, and sought thus to influ- ence to good or evil. And for this we have Scripture too, else what means the words of our Savior to Peter,-"Get thee behind me, Satan,"-what means the observation of John, in relation to Judas Iscariot,-"And after the sop, Satan entered into him." And what means those words in the Old Testament, purporting to be from a spirit,-"I will be a lying spirit in the mouths of all the prophets,"- alluding to false prophets. But we are not going to write a treatise on this mooted topic, only kind reader, indulge us to say a few words about these human guardian angels, given us in the sweet Providence of God, in order that we may know and reverence them. A child may be the guardian angel of a parent, as well as the parent of the child. A stranger may haply be our guardian angel, even when our own say, we know thee not. Walking one day, I saw before me a woman dressed in'mourning, led by a lad of ten or eleven. At first I thought she might be lame, but I soon saw by her gait, and the marks of a fall on her dress, that she was intoxicated. Little boys are usually very sensitive to shame, but all sense of shame in this lovely guardian angel seemed swal- lowed up in his deep affection. Most reverentially and tenderly he led her along, looking up in her face with a mixture of anxiety and pity and res- pect, beautiful to see. The little guardian protected his still revered, though fallen, mother, from all rude insult. She was not yet entirely lost to reason. I went up to her, and after a few words, spoke to her of her good son. "Oh!" said she, "he is an angel!" "Then you ought to be giving him a better example," said I, though fearing the lesson would be lost. He was one of these guardian angels. Reader, be wise; know and revere your human guardian angels. We return to our story. Now Jerry Woodliffe unquestionably had a good guardian angel, and who can read this history without knowing who that was,-but Jerry had an evil angel ila the person of Jake White.- Jake's folks had been of a sordid turn, and amassed considerable property  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7095-00000037"/> in-the business of keeping a groggery and gambling hall, as they are very appositely called. Jaxe had received a very limited education, passing most of his time in the purlieus of his father's shop. He was of a lethargic and heavy tem- peramernt, one of those men, who, having been for some time moderate drinkers with seeming impunity, form an excellent bait, wherewith Satan may entrap others. Jake had become intimate with Jerry while they were both young; Jerry being flattered with the notice of such a rich man as Jake was. It was Jake's example, though Jerry was unconscious of its in- fluence over him, which first emboldened him to taste the intoxicating cup. Jake had influenced Jerry, a year or two before our story commences, to join an engine company. They were a set of gay, active young fellows, full of jocularity and good humor. Several of them were excellent music- ians, and he liked their company well. Fellowship is very natural to man; it is a part of the love element of his 'original nature, and till men get good enough to be like their Heavenly Father and love the universal whole, sects and societies will be strong in sway over the heart by this gharm of fellowship. Jerry's wife had looked upon this step of Jerry's, with distrust and dread of its consequences. She acknowledged the object of the organization of engine companies to be good, having all the charm of the soldier's manly daring and braivery-yet its nobler object, to save life not to destroy it- but she saw these unions in their origin, so truly humane and patriotic, per- verted to other purposes, in some cases, Makt Was too cheery and genial herself, to wish to deprive her husband of innbcent, social recreation; but at the time he joined the society, he was in a state both of tnoral and religious declension. Now after his restoration to God and man, through the temperance pledge, she would have preferred to keep him out of the way of convivial company, especially while he was yet but lately recovered from the habit of intemperance, but her admonitions availed not here. Engine Society, No. - was a hobby wth Jerry, and to ;their atniversary supper he was determined to go.  .       i ^' ,     X }  The evening of the supper arrived. Singleton's fine new hall, opened for ,the first time, was brilliantly lighted. The Club having dispatched their busi- ,ness at the Engine room elected their officers, and having unanimously chosen Jake White, manager for the evening, marched in grand torch-light proces- sion, attended by a good band of music, to Singleton's new abode. A few lads walked in the rear, who had tickets of admittance as spectators of the :same, given them by the good will of the officers. As usual, a rabble of men, women, bogs and girls, and dogs followed the cavalcade to the very doors of Singleton's house. Singleton felt meanly elated at moving into this fine house, but he took care that his wife should not participate in that elation by telling her that till now she had had little or nothing to do; but now his outlay on the house had been so great, she would have to go to work in good earnest.- The poor woman's countenance fell; she was already overdone with her I   daily tasks and the idea of doing any more, so depressed her that the fine. house looked like a prison when she entered it. In fact in the tactics of husband rule Singleton put Petruchio in the shade;. for we must confess that we have read that drama in our younger days,.and! though the company in the hall is waiting for us, we must make a few re- marls en passant. This drama of Catherine and Petruchio, as well as many other things, leads us to think after all allowance for the age in which he wrote, that the moral nature of Shakespeare was far inferior to his intel- lectual nature. He was not an experimental Ch istian,.and the highest genius fails of its highest flight, till its wing is strengthened by Divine Faith. Laugh, unbelievers, if you will, you never can do your powers their utmost justice till you know the spiritual vigor of that eternal life which comes from Christ. Bunyan the Christian Shakespeare, though he is inferior in natural genius, yet look what a train of saving light follows him from age to age. 0Oh! had Shakespeare possessed that "hope which purifieth the soul even as He is pure" it would have cleansed away in Life's own Fountain, that moral taint so interwoven with the very life and richness of his immor- tal works, that his finest touches, his raciest wit, is so imbedded with moral filth, that in attempting to expurgate him, you emasculate his genius. And now to our story again. Among the company in marched Jerry Woodliffe, as finely dressed, as animated in bearing as the rest, but not al- together so much at ease in his mind, as most of his boon companions. Gaily they entered the temple of pleasure, little thinking of the widow of the former tenant of the house, who, from the window of her garret tenement, watched the dazzling glare of light, and heard the' festal music, while tears rolled down her wasted cheeks. But what does the gay world care for the wretched? Do those, whio share the nuptial revels of the tyrant of France, care for the noble prison. ers he has incarcerated? Singleton had, as directed, spared nothing that would make the enter- tanimcnt complete. The table was covered with a sumptuous entertain-- ment, elegantly served up. Our national creed of liberty and equality, is. no where more thoroughly carried out, than in the style of our club andi public dinners. The parvenucs are as luxurious as the nabobs, and, carry out the thing in full style. The feast went on with due hilarity. Porter and cider and water, being, the only liquors in circulation, till the dessert was brought on, and then a magnificent punch-bowl filled with punch was placed upon the table. If it had been a common bowl it would not have been. so alluring, but this was- a fine antique bowl, of the richest burnt china. The history of the bowl was this,- it had been won in a game by Jake's father, from a young blood who stole it from the cupboard of his: grandfather, a man of family and wealth. Within this royal vessel, the punch looked like liquid gold. Gentlemen," said Jake, if I followed my own taste, I should have ordered some champagne, but I regard the feelings of others; but this punch, gentlemen, nobody need be afraid to drink this; it is very sweec r  .  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7095-00000038"/> and rich," said he, filling his :goblet and taking it, " but gentlemen, these are temperance times,- some of you are pledged temperance men. So if there is any liquor at all in our punch, 'tis merely a dash, just for the name of it,-just to call it punch. I shall order no wine up, unless gentlemen request it. Here's a health to the temperance cause,--push round the bowl, gentlemen." The band now commenced an exhilarating air; when the bowl was first placed on the table, there was quite a sensation among the little group of youngsters admitted as spectators, and " that ain't temperance," was pretty loudly whispered among them, as they stood near the table. From the time that bowl was placed on the table, Jerry had eyed it with a longing, desire to taste. Besides that, Jerry had the false shame so natural and so general, about doing differently from those with whom we are in company, especially if the act implies a direct censure, upon them. That beautiful bowl, filled with punch,- Satan clothed like an angel of light, was pushed towards him. Oh, how he wished he had never come, where false shame and guilty desire, like two friends, held him fast. Alas, he had left his good guardian angel at home among her children; he had not listened to her warning words; "Husband, you are not strong enough yet to resist the temptations you may meet there." With a trembling hand he filled the goblet beside him. He was raising it towards his lips. "Stop!" cried a voice from one among the group of lads near the table, and the arm of the speaker was instantly stretched across the table, and the goblet was grasped. Indignation was about to flash from many eyes, but in leaning over the ta-  ble the boy's cap fell off, and the long, beautiful tresses of a woman fell from their confinement. We have said that Mary Woodliffe was a beautiful woman, but thus dis- covered, her beauty had something superhuman in it, as the cap fell off, and she was seen leaning across that table, her eyes shedding lightning through their tears, all her fine lineaments conspiring to reveal the heroism of a wo- man's love. He who could have resisted her power in that moment, only less than angel, would have defied an angel from heaven. Her husband all astonished and surprised as he was, was overawed and overcome. More i than woman at that moment, she seemed to inspire him too, with a moral courage above his nature. "Mary," said he firmly, " you have saved me. Gentlemen, I wish you a good evening, and may cold water be your only drink at your next celebration." In a moment Mary was with him, her arm locked in his, and they left the hall. "How did she get in? and how did she get in?" was the general in- quiry after she left. "I noticed," said one, "a lad among the boys, with his coat closely but- toned up, and his pent-house cap drawn over his eyes; when this great punch-bowl flowing so goldenly, came in, I observed him watching its course down the table, very closely, but I never suspected such a face as that we saw just now, was hidden under that cap. I thought it was some shy country lad." "Gentlemen," said the officer who had invited Mary Woodliffe, " you may blame me for all this; Mary Woodliffe is a cousin of mine, and there i   Oel, OUR MUSIC AT DAWN.         73 was a time when she was dearer than a cousin, ayt, or a sister either; but 6he was always full of life when she was a girl. so I thought nothing of it - when she came to me yesterday morning, and said,- 'Cousin Burton, there is to be a supper bfr Engine Company, No. . I think the ladies ought to go, don't you?" "Certainly," said 1. "Well," said she, " cousin I do want to go in just a few omerncts, and I will tell you how I want to go. I will dress up in a frock-coat and cap, atd you give me a ticket, and I will mix in with the rest of the boys." Now I never did refuse Mary Woodliffe any favor she asked of me, and I never could ; tis a moral impossibility. I handed her a ticket. "Fill of fun as ever, said I, Mary, I thought you had quieted down." More- over gentlemen, you may have observed I have not touched that punlch;-- I'have not signed the pledge yet, but after this evening's sce!n, I certainly shall. I had no idea our Engine Comlpany wereso far belhind in temrper- ance, as to have a bowl of strong brandy punch on the table, more esl:c- ially as the hall is hired of Mr. Simeon Singleton, a pious nlan, anl o1ne1 o' tile leading members of Mr. Mildmay's chlurch. I saw cider passed roulnd, and porter. I thought strange of that, but this brandy lpu)ch, (whllich looks and smells to me, pretty strong, Mr. President, pro temr., for all you call it weak) this is entirely unexpected ; and, as by the time the bowl is drailnet, gentlemen, I foresee you will be no companions for me, I wish yol a very good evening." What a disappointment was coming upon Singleton who fully expected to have overthrown Jerry, this tilme. One of the waiters soon came dowli stairs-laughinl. "What is'the matter?" said Singleton. "So funny!" said the waiter, "a woman got into the hall in boys' clotles and carried off her husband. There was a shy, singular looking lad amolng the boys, and I asked once or twice who it was, and could nit fifd out.- Well, the brandy punch had circulated down as far as one Mr. Woodlilfe," "Woodliffe," said Singleton, dooking blank as a cat when a bird flies just as she is going to seize it,) "are you sure his name was Woodliffe?" "Yes sir, and just as this Mr. Woodliffe gets his goblet of punch to his lips, whip comes an arm across the table, and seizes it, off went the boys' cap, down fell a proper heap of tie nicest curling hair you ever saw; and tlhe queer looking boy we had been watching all the evenlig, turned out to be--my, what a handsome woman!  She gave them all a start, I canl tell you." "Did he go with her?" said Singleton, ready to gnash his teeth with sup- pressed rage. "To be sure he did," said the waiter, "if she was mine, I would follow her to the ends of the earth ;" so saying, the waiter returned to his post again, leaving Singleton completely crest-fallen. To add to his anlloyance, I Ready just then came in. "How now, Singleton?" said lhe, : I suppose friend lerry is halt' seas ov(er by this time?

"Gone," said Ready, " what do you mean?' Just then the waiter return- ed with the bowl of puncth, saying that Engine Company No. - had de- cided by a very handsome lmaority, that they would have no more brandy puch ; that they lad sent ifr Mr. and Mrs. Woodliffe, and Mr. Burton to return to the lia 1, and had formed themselves into a temperance society on the spot ; had drawn up a pledge, and were all signing it like fun." "Why, Mr. Singleton,;' said the waiter, with a broad laugh, "ain't you pleased? I thought you told me, sir, this evening, when we were making up the punch, tlat this drinking was against your own principles, but done just to please them. I thought this would suit you first rate." "Hold your tongue, you - darky, what business have you to think l' said Ready. "I don't know as I have ; but somehow I cannot help it sometimes," and so saying he rather hastily lcft the kitchen. "I don't see," says Ready, after the man had gone, ':any way to trip up Jerry, his wife is too much for us." "I never will give up to a woman," said Singleton, who was constitution- ally a hater and despiser of womene, and never tolerated them except (as he said) right in their places, lard at work, otherwise he said they were al- ways in mischief. It was obnoxious to him to sec a woman in the enjoy- ment of the least ease or liberty." Always observe it, reader, if you see a truly contemptible man, you will find that man a woman hater. Woman is the music, the poetry of existence, and as lie wlo is insensible to music, "llath his affections dark as Erebus" so is the man who has no ear, no heart for the harmonics of woman's soul. While the two baffled evil ones were gnashing the teeth below, Mr. Bur- ton, Mrs. Woodlifc and her husband re-joined tie company above stairs.- Trlle supper table was replenished in temperance style-Singleton not dar- ing to refuse cold water, and temperance songs replaced the orgies of Bac- chu s. The hall was thus duly consecrated at its olelning to temperance. It was a wonder Singleton had not died that night from churlishness, like Na- hal of old, for his heart sank within him like a dead weight, because of the exploit of this modewl beautiful Abigail.   OR. OIJU MU:SIC .T r).nAwN        72W  " With whom hast Thou left those few sheep in the wilderiss? I know the pride and the naughtiness of thy heart."' These were the envi- ous, carping words of Eliah to his brother David, not knowing that he was the champion appointed by Heaven, to overthrow Goliah. Perhaps the reader'is ready to enquire, with whom Mary Woodliffe left her youngl family during her successful foray recounted in our story, Sin- gleton, whose tender heart was of course much concerned for the forsaken little ones, thus poured out the milk of his sympathy, to his wrili,-- "Moll Woodliffe would look much better staying at home minding her brood of young ones. Jerry Woodliffe is not fit to manage a woman. Let me catch you, Nabby, trolloping about to men's places in that style, and I will quickly put you in the house of correction. Women take great liberties now-a-days. A woman's place is in her own kitcliemi, minding her own affairs and obeying her husband, as the Bible tells her to. A woman li as no business to know anything else ; as soon as she does, she is good for nothing. Even religion a woman cannot carry off reasonably like a man. She lets it run away with her. I think Paul makes it out that the upshot of a wromanl's religion slould be, to stay at home and take care of her family.- You have learnt that kind of religion, Naby y; you know your place, and 1 meant to teach you that when I married you ; a man that can't bring his wife down to be submissive, is a fool, and ought to be ashamed of himself." Now reader, we do not care for carping Eliab or Singleton, but for the sake of the true friends of Mary Woodliffe, we will go back a little and cx- Judith. When Mary iobuld that her husband was not to be persuaded fromn going' to the supper, she did not despair, but opening her Bible, she read the story of Judith, that woman of courage ;lad conduct, and she felt sall she was a kindred spirit, ready to do and dare in a good cause, and she took counsel with her own thoughts, and laid the wise little plia we have seen come off with such success. She was a tailoress, and liad inl the house a frock coat to repair for the son of a friedd, which exactly fitted lher person. The cap was readily procured. \Iarly's husband's sister, Anna Mellen, had no children of her own, and was like a second mother to Mary, so that Ma ry had only to tell ler that she had a very urgent call out tlat evening and Anna was glad of the rare privilege of supplying her place. Every little head was asleep on its pillow; every household matter cared for, and Ann1" Mellen had received many motherly dii'ections, before Maly left her home.

After all was over on that memorable evening, and Jerry and his wife had returned home, 'I hope dear Mary,' said he, 'that by the blessing of God you have cured me ; I hope all other attempts to ensnare me I shall be able to resist. Never shall I forget the time when you seized that cup, and I found that it was you, my Mary, my dear preserver. How beautiful you looked! I felt as ashamed as if an angel from heaven had come down and caught me in my sin. Mary, I never shall, and never can be worthy of you,' but hereafter I will try to do right.' Thus happily ended the affair. The widow Grafton was in her garret tenement the day after the supper, She felt friendless and forsaken. She did not know that there was one being in all that great city who had any real sympathy for her sorrows.- Her husband had moved into the city from the country, some years before, and she, being of a retiring disposition, and the mother of a young and in- creasing family, had formed but few acquaintances. She was a good housewife, and occupied herself in domestic matters. Trouble had quite overthrown her. She had seen all that made her little world of happiness and usefulness rudely rent from her; nothing spared but her helpless child- ren to share and increase her wretchedness. She did not know what to do to obtain a living. She had obtained a little sewing, but did not know where to look next. Her religious ideas were limited. She had a notion (and it is a very general one,) that at some time or other in her life, she should be convicted and converted; but that good time always remained in the distance, although her morality was exemplary. She had no God to go to,- her feelings always returned upon herself. She had watched with an aching heart, the splendor of the last evening's show, and was sitting sady at her work, with that dejected, forlorn heaviness of heart,which only those who have known her sorrows, can appreciate. There seemed a sort of a prayer to form in her heart,- "Oh! send a helping hand!" wlhen a light, quick footstep was heard on the stairs, and then a gentle tap at the door. She rose to open it, and a young, ingeluous-looking girl with one of those beaming faces that do the heart good, presented herself as Mrs. (Grafton opened the door. Shel hld quite a sizeable basket on her arm. "Is this Mrs. Grafton?" said the young visitant. "I am," said the widow. "And I, said she, "am Helen Mildmay, the daughter of Mr. Mildmay the minister." "Oh yes, I have heard much said of him, please take a chair, Miss Mild- may, and excuse the room. Once I could have given you a better recep- tion;" "You will not think me intrusive, I hope, Mrs. Grafton. Mother has sent me to see if we can do anything for you." "How came you to hear or know anything about me? I did not know there was anybody cared anything about me, how is it? T am not a meii-   OR, OUR MUSIC AT DAWN.          " her of your church, nor any church, I wish I was good enough to be;" and the poor woman wiped hier tears away. "What of that?" said Helen, "in this case you want help perhaps, more than if you were a church member, for then the church would, or ought to be interested for you. Did you ever think, Mrs. Grafton. how the poor Jew must have felt, while that good man he had been taught to hate and despise and look upon as a half heathenish mongrel outcast from the faith, was stooping over him, and pouring in the oil and the wine, into his wounds, While those of his own religion passed him by? Oh! Mrs. Grafton," said the young enthusiast, "there are very few understand the real scope of tile dear Saviour's parable, and I should not if my father had not taugth me, Mrs. Grafton." "But mother sent a few things in this basket for you. and this evening when my brothers are at leisure, we will bring some more." "Thank you, thank-you, " said the widow, ,how wonderful this all looks to me, Miss Mgildmay! 1 never thought it would do for me to pray,becallsc I was so wicked, except to repeat the Lord's prayer, but just before you came in, I did almost tdare to pray for help to be sent."' "And doesn't the kind answer encourage you to come again?" said IIlen. "Yes, I think it is wonderful, and if 1 was only good elnough, I should love to pray, I think it would ease my heart." "There was somebody once," said Helen, "Lthought they were good enough to pray, and the Lord did not accept him, because he trusted to his good- ness. Somebody else thought he had been so wicked he dared not lift up his eyes to heaven and only cried for mercy, and he was heard." "This sounds good to me," said the widow, "different from anything I ever heard, or else I feel differently ; but tell me Miss Helen, how you came to hear about me?" '"My father," said Helen, "hcaring that Mr. Singleton had taken the house for debt, felt concerned for ycu as a friendless widow; anld learned by in- quiries your present abode, and poor condition, and we want to help you." "Thank you kindly, Miss Helen, but if I could only get in some way of business, I could help myself, but what can I do? I never learnt a trade, as my father lived on a farm far back in the country." ' Father, told us one of your neighbors said you were an excellent house- wife," said Helen. "Well it is true I am acquainted with all kinds of household business." "Mother said when she heard this, that if it could be accomplished, and you could be established as the head of a boarding house, it would be just tle thing. But we wanted to speak to you first, for if any one is going to help another, they ought to consult the person they mean to assist, as they might not like, your way of helping them." "I like the plan," said Mrs Grafton, " it is what I am used to, for my father living in a romantic place on the road to the White Mountains, we always kept boarders in summer. But dear Miss Mildmay, this hard man, this Mr. Singleton, has left me nothing only what the law allows." "If you like the plan, Mrs. Grafton, I will go and see what we can do, we may nlot sluceed-do not be too sanguine, but we will try."  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7095-00000041"/> 78             THE REVEILLE: "How many little ones have you?" "Six. All but the two youngest are old enough to go to school; Neddv and the baby are lying in the bed room." "I must have a romp with them, some day," said Helen. "Onice, Mrs. Grafton, it would have been a comparatively easy taskI to raise this money, for my father was a universal favorite, but his zeal inll re- formation movements, especially the temperance cause, has lessened our in- fluence with many of the wealthier class of people, but no matter, God can turtn men's hearts as the streams of water are turned." Poor Mrs. Grafton sighed when Helen mentioned the temperance move.- ment. "I love your father the more for that," said Mrs. Grafto. Gr "As Mr. Sin- gleton is so much against the temperance cause, I thought perhaps his mrin- ister was. "No," said Helen, "it is not 'like people like priest,' in this case." "Good morning, Mrs. Grafton, keep up good courage, all will be well." Helen now, with soeth ing of a beating heart, but looking up to God, set forth on tier new enterprise. The first place she came to in her route, was Mrs. Gray's, the same lady whose free comments upon) Helen to her two gentlemen visitors, we have recorded in another chapter. Only those who have been on a begging mission, and have felt it a ditty to call at places where they were not very popular themselves, can have an idea of Helen's feelings as she ascended the lofty steps of Mrs. Gray's aristocratic mansion. Her mother had left it discretionary with her where to go, and she thought it best to begin where she was known. It was not the first time she had been here on a like errand, but never under similar circumstances. She paused a moment on the upper step, looked up to God and then rang the bell. A servant came and ushered her into the froeit one of two parlors, connected by-folding doors. Helen sent up her name, and presently the lady appeared. Her manner was polite, but sufficiently dignified to remind Helen of her father's misdemeanors. Helen at once stated the object of her call, with her usual graceful but earnest manner of presenting her charit- able cases' "Really," said Mrs. CtGrey, "I know nothing of this person; I do not re- member to have heard of her. Is she one of the poor of our congregation?'" "No, madam." "Then, Miss Mildmay, I think we had better relieve our own poor, and let each parish do the same. Grafton, did you say that was the name?" "Yes, madam, she is the widow of Stephen Grafton." "Ah! he was a cabinet maker; I recollect the other day passing a house where some carpenters were at work altering the front, and some person who was with them mentioned that Mr. Singleton had taken it for debt.- Strange that a person with a lucrative trade and once an owner of so good a house as that, should leave his family so wretchedly poor as you represent them to be-perhaps it is his wife's extravagance." "No, it was the husband's intemperance," said Helen. "Oh dear, there it is again, it is quite a mania now to attribute every- thing to intemperance. Indeed. Miss Helen, my plrse is quite low just now\   Ot, OUR Mi SIC Al DAWN.          79 anid it does not strike Inc that this is a proper object. 'T'llere are so many similar eases. Y',oit will excuse me then from doing anything in this case." Poor Helen was about to rise and retire, when a young man canie ii from the adjoinlig parlor, and, his face reddeling to the forehead, handed Miss Mildmaiy a twenty dollar note, and said,- "You are entirely welcome to that. Miss Mildmay, for your very praise- worthy object, it' it will be of any service."' Tile lady thus rebuked, blushed with shamie, pilt her hand into eler bag, and drawing thence a futh- and splendid )purse, handed her a dollar, sayintg, "I can perhaps stpare that." The young gentlemen atten(ed her to the door, and, bowing low, wilhed her success. Helen tripped down the high steps tshe had so"reluctatntly ascend(ed, with a movement liglit as a bird's. She tlhen lifted her heart to (od, in gratefiul thanks with. a gentle sigh of prayer lfr the true conversion of the generous donor of the twenty dollars, a prayer none the less deep tlhat it was unuttered. Helen went oii to the next pilace oi' solicitation. This was the house of lihr school day friend, now a fahshionable belle, though it was not long since they shared together their childish confideinces. This belle was the Miss Hosmer, with wit hom a former chapter made us acquainted. Miss Hosmer was an heiress, very afflble and accessible however, so that Helen here dlid not dread the ill-natured reception she had met with at Mrs. Grey's,- but she feared encountering her friend's usual morning levee of beaux. Helen had not ceased to feel as a child, and she resolved to accommodate her own bashfulness by asking to see Miss Iosiner alone. However, as it  was not yet the fahshionable hour for visiting, Miss Hosnmer had but one vis- itant, who was indeed, the young man given to the heroic in speechccl, of whonm we have before spoken, and who had become a suitor of Miss Hlos- mer's. Miss Hosmer came forward to meet Helen most cordially ; insisted her coming in, and introduced her to iher friend. After a few common- places, Helen told the object of her call. "Dear me," said Miss Hosmcer, "how unfortuniate. I am just preparing to go with a party to Niagara, and tiem fashions this Spring are so mons- trously expensive,-besides I hiave just had my jewels reset. However, I will give you a trifle. 'You will give something, will you not, Mr. Dud- ley?" added she turning to the young gentleman. "Unquestionably," answered lie, rising and approaching Helen, "but instead of begging yourself, Miss Mildmnay, you could have all mankind at your feet, begging for the least emanation of light from your smiles." Helen, who kept a corner in her little full heart for mirth, in its season, would have liked to indulge in a good hearty laugh at the stream of hyper- bohelical compliment, of which this speech was the prelude. She managed to keep her countenance, though not to restrain her blushes ; but as the visit ended with a ten dollar note from Dudley, and five from Miss Hosmer, she left the house feeling much cheered. She could not help smiling when Thinking of the way in which Miss Hosmer pleaded her pitiable nec- essity of havizg twenty fashionable dresses and her jewels rc-ct.  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7095-00000042"/> 30            THE REVEILLE: Yet on deeper reflection, (and that, in Helen's mind, always succeeded her lighter thoughts,) she grieved that her young, beloved, and amiable friend, did not, as yet, know the true way of llappiness. Her thoughts then reverted to her success. " Thirty-six dollars already; I ought to be so grateful to them all, and love them all. Dear Mrs. Grafton, I do really hope now we shall get your house furnished." The next place,- a place of dread to her,- was Mrs. Bigland's, who was one of those wealthy would-be aristocrats, who carry their purse-proud hauteur much further tlan those of more palmy birth. Helen rang at the door, and was admitted by the servant. "Anyhow," thought she, "I find  them all at home."  Mrs. Bigland entered the room, and, after the morning  salutations were exchanged, Helen acquainted the lady with the object of  her call. "Indeed," said Mrs. Bigland, with a supercilious sneer, "I wonder Miss  Mildmay you should think of asking aid of people with whose manner of acquiring means, you or your father, which is all the same, pretend to con- demn. I think it is quite inconsistent. Mr. Bigland and myself, are not so silly as you appear to imagine.  What, celsure us for the manner in which we make our money, and then to suppose that we shall give you money to please the fancies of those who censure us ! No Miss Mildmay, we are not such gross fools--- pity you, for you are not to blame so much as your pa- rents, who are making themselves and you quite ridiculous, by sending you about on such expeditions." Helen said not a word, but rising, bade Mrs. Bigland good morning. She felt badly, but just as she came to the foot of the flight of steps, she encountered Deacon Stillworm. He looked so softened and so humble, his penitential aspect soothed her.  It did her good to see the change. "Abroad on some kind errand, I suppose, Miss Mildmay," said he, " cati I aid you in any way ? for now I long for opportunities to make amends to my fellow creatures for my past life." Helen briefly told her story, and ten dollars was so cheerfully added to her store, that it fully proved the demon of covetousness was fully cast out of the Deacon's soul. Helen next stopped at the house of a Quaker lady of wealth. Here she was led into a room where an exact elegance, gave beauty to comfort.- When the friend entered, and Helen told the purport of hIr call,- "May I ask thy name ?" said the friend.        ( "Helen Mildmay." 'Is thee friend Mildmay's daughter, the minister who is bearing so good a testimony for temperance ?" "I am," said Helen. "Thee is walking in a good way, and I am glad to aid thee, for thine own and for thy father's sake." With these words she made the generous addition of twenty dollars to Helen's collections, telling her not to mention what she had done. "I have heard of thee before," said she, "and thy ways, and I should like to know more of thee. I wish ryounu  women of thy stamp were more frequent in the City."   Helen, who thought nothing of her own artless, spontaneous works of love, now blushed to find it praised, especially from so grave and dignified a person.  She was about taking leave, when tle friend lho lad accomn- panied her to the door, said, "Perhaps it would be well for thee to call at Wid- ow l)eborah Morton's  Shie lives opposite there, in that large house.  She is abundantly able to help thee in thy work, if she chooses; slhm is peculiar, but thou canst but try.  She may be stern with thee, but I see thou art one willing to bear the yoke in thy youth," Helen accordingly went next to the lhotse designated, and was introduced by the servant into the room, where sat in quiet state, Widow r)cborah lor- toll. "Be seated," said she, then added, "what is thy wish ?"  Helen felt her stern stateliness, and timidly stated her story. "Who directed thee to come here ?" Helen by this time'heartily wished she had not ventured into such a presence, and said modestly,-"Friend Gilman, who lives opposite." "What may I call thy name ?" "Helen Mildtnay." "Thy father is a minister, is he not ?" "Yes." "He has a good salary, why cannot he take care of thle poor of his parish without sending thee about begging for him ? Thee should be at home at- tending to thy studies, not running at large in this way." "The woman for whom I ask aid, friend Morton, is not of my father's congregation, but a stranger to us." "Then let me tell thee, 'charity begints at home.' Thee need not be hunt- ing up strangers.  We friends take care of one another; thee don't see ls runninlg begin to other denominations ; but as tlhec seems to have good in- tentions, I will give thee twenty-five cents. But stop, how much dlid friendl Gilman give tlh,,-, ?" "She told me not to mention the sum.", "'Wouldlt't thee tell, if it would lead me to think better of thy cause, and induce me to give more.  I think well of fricnd Gilman's discretion and judgment." "No," said Ielen, "for that would be doing evil that good may come." "Thee wouldn't then, on any consideraltion " "No.' "Then tlee may take this ten dollar bill as a reward of thy faithfulness to good principles.  Thee is a cloice one. Come agail." Helen thanked her, the tears springing to her eyes, for friend Morton's severity at first, and the pleasant re-action, together, wrought on her feel- ings.  Her next call was at the house of a wealthy professor, of high standing, whose influential name Helen had seen at the head of sole )popu- lar charities. Here Helen felt quite sure of gettilng some aid, but while waiting for the lady of the house to appear, Helen's heart grew sad at the ostentation of wealtl and luxury displayed in the room.  It oppressed her spirits, nor with all her love of art, could those spilendid efforts of getC ils,    &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7095-00000043"/> U H            J, A ,1 r j It , VJT -JLA JX r, which served to enrich the room, consoled the true heart of -Telen, for tie unfeeling, the unsisterly contrast of that room with some dwellings she had seen that very day. Presently a lady entered, whose appearance accorded with the superb mansion of which she was mistress. Helen in a few words told her mission. The lady instantly entered with great fluency into a history of all her calls of charity, and the various societies to which she be-  longed; but it happened she brought in with her one of those wise, intermed- dling little ones, that are called pert children, because they often speak truths  offensive to their elders. "There is the Bible Society," said Mrs. Selby. "That's fifty cents a year." said the little girl.  "Be quiet, Louise. There's the Home Mission.,' "Twenty-five cents a year," muttered the little exposer, but too low for t Helen to hear, however. But the mother was too intent on recording her good deeds, to observe this by-play. "There's the Society for relieving Indigent Females." "That's ninepence," still less audibly muttered the little girl,- and soon  after she slipped out of the room, but soon returned with a little purse in tier hand. The mother, having run out her list, added,-        c "And then my name you know, Miss Mildmay,. at the head of some of  these societies, has great influence, as much perhaps from my husband's t public character, as my own." Just then the little girl came to her side, pushing her gently, to attract her attention.  "What is the matter with you this morning, Louise?" said the mother.  "May I give the lady the quarter of a dollar in my purse, for the poor children?"  "Oh! that's for your Sabbath School offering." "No Ma, I paid that out of last week's money."           t( "Then this you will want for the Children's Home Mission."  "No, no, Ma, you know I paid that three weeks ago. This twenty-five tl cents is mine, and I want to give it to the poor children." So the mother yielded, but while Helen drew the little girl up to her to caress her, the lady went on,-"So constantly am I oppressed and overrun tc with beggars of all sorts, that I am obliged to retrench my own personal expenses to meet these things. Now really, Miss Mildmay, I think such people as you represent had better become a town charge, and I do not feel a it right to give anything."                      y "Oh, ma, ma!" said Louise, bursting into tears, " you gave a hundred c dollars for a shawl yesterday, and two hundred for some Brussells lace, and t won't you give the poor lady one dollar?"               ai "Louise, leave the room directly," said the lady. "That child gives me tl much trouble," continued Mrs. Selby. "She is very observing, and wants tl to know and bear her part in everything. As you see she has a perfect ma- o nia for giving, and of course it must be restrained. Let me see, she gave c; you twenty-five cents, did she not?"  "Yes, madam."  "Well, that must answer fcr our part of the benefaction."      fi ':,2   OR, OUR MUSIC AT DAWN.         8J "No, no," said the little girl, who had left the door a-jar, and now caint running in, "I have been to Papa, and he has given me five dollars for the lady." Helen couldn't help running to kiss her. "My'dear little friend," said she, "I thank you, but I want your mamma to consent to this, before 1 :ake it." "I suppose Louise has been dunning her father, and he gave it to be rid of icr," said Mrs. Selby. "I will go and bring Pa," said Louise. "I want him to see the nice, rood young lady, for I love her." Away she ran, and soon returned with a frank, intelligent looking gen- leman. "What is all this," said he, "that Louise is so full of?" Mrs. Selby explained. He insisted on Helen's taking the money, and gaily commended his little virl's taste in physiognomy, for she said she told him she knew it was a :ood lady talling with her mamma, for site looked like a very good lady. The next place where Helen called, was at the house of a very sour, as- :etic person, whom she knew by name. This person, though a pietist, lad lone of the milk of the word, She reccived her and talked witl her on his wise. "Where have you been to-dayMiss Mildmay?" Helen mentioned some of the places. "Your father is a great opposer to rumselling," said the lady, "and yet on have applied to some people who get their money in that way; that is ot consistent. Did not this occur to you?" "No, madam, I only thought they were rich and it would give me an op- ortunity to do good." "I think you ought to be very particular where you go. You ought not go to worldly people, because you lead them to depend on good works. oul ought not to go to religious people out of your own church, because ley have burdensome calls in their own church." "Do you mean to give me anything?" said Helen. "Oh, no, not a cent," said the lady, "only give you a little advice. As this woman, her own church should take care of her." "She belongs to no church," said Helen. "Then the town ought to take care of such heathen, that don't belong nywhere. You pick up curious subjects, Miss Mildmay. The last time ott came to me it was about an Irish woman, and I told you then that I ould have nothing to do with that crew; the Catholics were as bad as ley could live, and the Pope was rich enough to take care of all the sick Id drunken Irish without us. And now you've come about a heathen tat's living here in this gospel land, and don't belong anywhere. I'd let ie town taake care of such hardened ones as these, if I was you, and look Lit for the poor of the household of faith. And even to niggers,-- you arne to me once about a sick nigger, Miss Mildmay. If I were you I rould never meddle with them; I believe the mark of Cain is on them all." "Oh, no," said Helen, "the flood destroyed the last of the line of tie rst murderer. Only Noah's family, who descended from Seth, survived."  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7095-00000044"/> 4' Well, Miss Mildmay, you are a minister's daughter, and know how to talk, but I am as firm as the hills; I always have thought it was Cain's mark, and I always shall." Helen having thus very quietly received her portion, left this candid, charitable lady. Helen could not but admit the truth of one invidious re- marl she made,- that it was not consistent to seek aid from those who gain the power to aid us, from a sin we rebuke. She felt that it must take from the powel of rebuke, if we participate in the fruits of sin. And this is generally true, although the structure of society is so interwoven with sin, that there may be an involuntary participancy in some cases, without  actual guilt, But- lest the reader should be weary of following our Helen, we will only say that she worked' on till noon, and then, being in the neighborhood,- went in to dine with good mother Sealove. Here she was always at home, being, as the reader knows, quite a pet with the Captain and his good lady. The Captain, good man,.had sailed the day before, but Mrs. Sealove cheer- fully added five dollars to Helen's store, although she was one of those Vwho are always quietly doing good every day, to those in need. Refreshed atld blest, and warmly encouraged, Helen returned to her walk. It was sunset when her weary step again was heard by the widowGraf- ton, ascending the stair-care. The little family were enjoying a como!rta- ble supper, and oh! what a change Helen saw in the face of the widow.- Hope was there. Helen's mother had not waited till evening. She had; visited them, and liberally provided for every present necessity. "You know I told you this morning," said Helen, "I had no right to hope for the success I have formerly had in affairs of this kind, but I never had so much. It did seem that God opened my way. In places where it looked most dark, something would happen to turn darkness into light be- fore me. If I go on successfully you will certainly have your wish. Mrs. Sealove, a good friend to everybody, tells me there is soon to be an auctiol out of town, a few miles from here where will be a fine chance for you to pick up furniture, meanwhile we will be looking for a good stand." While they were speaking, they heard another and heavier step on the stairs. A venerable old man, his beard and curling locks of snowy white- ness, now entered. His face had a kind quiet look. He wore a broad brimmed hat, a high collared coat buttoned up close. "I live out of town," said he to Mrs. Grafton, " but accidentally hearing of thy hard case, and the interest this young woman hatl so kindly taken in thee, while in town to-day, I have concluded to let thee a house of which I have a lease for two years, that thee may fully try thy experiment. It is a house I hired of Mr. Morely, as he still by arrangement has the care of it, thee may go to him, hand him this sealed note and he will give thee the keys. This card contains his address." "I'm afraid of that awpy old man," said Amy Grafton, the youngesti except the babe. "Is it the wicked man, or is it the good man?" enquired Neddy, a puz- zled theologian, three years old.   OR, OUR MUSIC AT DAWN.          8.5 "No," said George, who was deeply read in fairy tales, " but it is one of the good Genii, they always look so." Helen sat awhile as much puzzled as the rest. At length rousing from her reverie she said-c"I feel all my weariness gone, so much good has this new event done me.   I have been trying to think who this kind benefactor is,--but no matter, he is sent of G(od. Call at our house Mrs. Grafton, on your way to Mr. Morely's. I know about him,- he is a rich old bachelor lawyer, and called eccentric, but benevolent. We will go with you.7" Helen now returned home, and made a very merry time at the supper-ta- ble among the children, by ler graphic relation of her adventures. In the' evening, she, with her mother and Mrs. Grafton, had a pleasant moonlight walk to Mr. Morely's; who, upon reading the note, immediately gave up the keys to Mrs. Grafton. They found the house and situation every way eligible for their purpose, and returned home happy. Miss losmer wras tlhe unrivalled belle of a fashionable party, that evening, but our little celen. would not have exchanged dreams with her that night.  CHAPTER X V   I II. THE DEATH BED. It was the close of a fair, still afternoon in the last part of May. In a" roonl Vwhere the shutters were partly closed, and the mellow, dying light shone gently in, lay, on a clean, humble bed, a sick man in the last stage of duick consumption. That had once been a magnificent temple whichh now lay in ruins. He was of most comely proportions. The thick masses of loose brown curls, waved back from his forehead as he slept. There was a' touching look of deep sorrow on his face, the compunction of a generous i nature, grieved at the misery his fall had wrought; far more grieved for those he loved, than for his own fate. At some little distance from the bed, sat two friends in earnest conversation. The elder of the two was' about forty. She wore a plain widow's cap, bound back with black ribbon. Her's was one of those deeply quiet, religious faces, one meets with so rarc- ly amidst the bustle, enterprise and activity, which pervades all' life, even religious life, in this country. Deeper sorrows and a deeper spirituality than usual, had united to impart to her countenance its sweet resigned, reveren- tial expression. This expression was aided by the natural east of her Grecian features,-- her sweeping ey-lashes, and large, downcast black eyes. The female sle was talking with was young and lovely. She had just *[!  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7095-00000045"/> 86            THE REVEILLE; come in on a neighborly call; her sun-bonnet was carelessly thrown back, and a remarkable profusion of beautiful tresses were falling about her charm- ing face. She held the hand of her friend, and her eyes were wet and her color came and went while she talked with her companion. It was Lucy Riverly and Mary Woodliffe. "It is a sad thing," said Lucy Riverly, " to see him wearing away so fast, but still there is a safer feeling in having him there, even there, as he is, and my last hope on earth dying with every week breath he draws, than the feeling I had during those long, long, dreary days last winter, when I sat at my work and did n't dare to think where he was. Oh! how long those short winter days seemed, but when the sun did set, I would begin to feel sick and a trembling dread to see him come home, came over me. You know all about it." "Yes indeed I do,--I know how to feel for you," said Mary, " you are a tender mother, and I am a loving wife, and we can tell what sorrow this drinking brings." "Ahi! Mary, and what a son I had! I am afraid I was proud of him, and thought nobody had a finer-looking boy than mine; but he was better than handsome, le was generous and dutiful, and kind, and once so pious. Ah. me! I do try to lay it all down at the feet of mercy, but I cannot help having a poor weak mother's heart, after all." She wept, and Mary wept with her. Tears ask for mingling tears. "How is his mind now?" enquired Mary. "Brother Mildmay told me he thought him in a good way." "I think he does experience comfort, and the grace of pardon, but he is dead grieved to think hie has brought so much trouble on me, for lie loved me dearly. He says he wanted to be a comfort to me, and lie has been a curse. Thell you know William was proud and spirited, and it always cut him to the heart to think lie should leave a drunkard's name and a drunk- ard's shame behind him; and this for my sake more than his own. He has said to me, many a time, with heavy sighs, just as if the thought was loading him down. 'Instead of being a praise, I shall be a reproach to you, - I ought to have been an honor, and 1 am a shame. They might have said of me after I was dead,- what a good son! now they will say, lie broke his mother's heart.' " 'Then I would try to comfort him, and say, No, no, dearest Willie, all good people will say, with truth, that when you were struggling hard with your besetting sin ; then crafty, cruel men, laid a snare for your unwary feet; they wont blame you, my love. Then he would embrace and bless me; and he would say, my good, good mother, I believe like your Saviour, / you could bless and forgive your murderers. These are the thoughts and exercises, dear Mary, that betimes becloud his mind." "I think," said Mary, "he has a very sorrowful look, but still the holy hope is there, like the moon behind a cloud. I came over to see you, and to say my husband will watch with him to-night." Mary then drew her shawl about her and left the room. After she had gone, Lucy Riverly sat awhile in deep, prayerful thought;   OR, OUR MUSIC AT DAWN.           87 but a movement from her son brought her to his bedside. He was still asleep; but his mother with a mother's quick eye, saw that his sleep was more heavy than usual. Bending over him, she perceived that his breath was weaker and his countenance was changed. "William, dear," said she, trying to rouse him, "would'nt you like a good cup of tea, and a little toast." He opened his eyes, smiled, made the usual motion of assent, and then fell asleep again. His mother prepared the tea, trembling all the while, and praying that God would keep her through the great crisis which she saw was just at hand. Oh, Death, Death, whenever, wherever thou comest there is a sol- emn majesty about thee; thrilling the heart with awe, as vivid as if thou hadst never before visited the home of man! Myriads have died, yet never can we get familiar with thee. To the mourners, all nature seems to pause, and feel with them when a friend dies. Around the believer the angels hover, yet still it is all sotemn awe, and a death bed where religion is not, is the darkest place of distress, this side of eternity. Though all the friends around should seem unconscious of the great crisis, there is a wit- ness in every heart, that the unbelief that braves the lightning, and defies the thunder, is not so hardened as the unbelief that remains insensibie with- in sight of a death bed. Lucy was a child of God, yet it struck to her heart when she felt that death had come; that the last tender tie was to be broken. She had never loved her son more than now. The affection which his drunken conduct might have shut in for a time, returned with double force. There had been a melancholy satisfaction in the thought, that crippled and sick as lie was, he was out of danger of fiture temptation, remote firom the snares of men. She felt like some good shepherd that had recovered a torn, wound- ed lamb from the wolves, and had it safe in the fold, and she did not realize that the parting hour was drawing nigh. So tenderly was she engrossed in her cares for his body and his soul. Relieved by good friends, from all pressing necessity, she had all leisure for her loving task, and many an hour of gentle, peaceful, religions intercourse had that mother and son. Yet many also were the seasons, where the bitterness, the anguish of his repln- tance and regret, gave her pungent pain. He could not forgive himself.- "Look to thy saviour, not to thyself," she would say; and not always in vain did she uplift the cross before him. But now the stern summons had come, he was to go, helr darling, her only one! What wonder, then, that the thought, that her goodly, her beautiful son, had been murdered for the sake of gain, rushed bitterly upon her mother heart. Sadly she prepared the re- freshments she feared he would be unable to receive. Having prepared it she aroused him, he drank the tea and appeared to revive a little, but soon he sank away again into that deep, heavy sleep. His mother prayed that God would gently lead her dear son through the dark valley, and that those who had betrayed him might know, might feel what they had done, re- lent, and be forgiven. The consciousness that her son had been betrayed and murdered, was strong upon her soul; yet while she felt that they had wrested from her, her life's liope, who now lay dying before her; there was /  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7095-00000046"/> 88            THE REVEILLE; that loving grace in her heart which presently melted into prayer for those murderers. The forgiving spirit of christianity may exist with the keenest sensibility of wrong, yea, and there win its noblest triumphs. At first, in- deed there had been some hindrance, some struggle, but when the human weakiness gave way, the heavenly spirit got free, and loosened and launch. ed out into unrestrained communion.               / She prayed as those onlly pray, where for the time the Divine has swal. lowed up the human. She was too much absorbed to perceive that any one had entered, till a deep, strong groan, as if it rent the heart it came fronm, startled her. She looked up, and directly opposite the foot of the bed, sat Deacon Stillworm, his head bowed, and trembling like one in convulsions. , Mr. Mildmay who had accompanied him, sat back in the room, a weepilg witness of this victory of the gr6ave. Lucy Riverly rose from lher lkneelillng posture, and wiping her eyes, gently extended her hand to Deacon Still- worm. He could lnot speak at first, but at last he said,- "Sister Riverly what a wretch I have been! I never knew anything about the power, of grace, till this moment! Oh! how good to pray so for me!" The earnestnless with which he spoke, roused the sick man. He opened hs eyes, saw the Deacon weeping, and at once appeared to realize the feel- ing that had brought him there, and looked kindly upon him. The Deacon drew near the bed,- his tears fell fast. "William," said he, " poor William, can you forgive me?" "Yes," said the young man in a thick, faltering voice, " even as God for Christ's sake, has forgiven me," and he put out his thin, cold hand, in pledge of his words. The Hand! how often it can speak a feeling more eloquelnt- ly than words! There was something in the kiid, forgiving pressure of that hand so soon to be motionless, that completed the work of God ol tlhe lheart of the Deacon, and ever after when Satan sotght to enter, there would colne a saving thought of that dying man's token of forgiveness. ", Shall we stay with you, Sister, till the watchers come?" asked Mr.  Mildmay. She only replied by a look and motion, which seemed to say, " leave me alone with him." Awhile after this scene, they left. The long-lingering twilight still made lovely the hour between a magnifi- cent sunset and the still, starry beauty of evening. Sister Lucy had drawln back the curtain of the window near the bed, and now sat in the soft light beside her dying son. Oll! how precious to her, was every remaining no- ment of that dear life. She sat intently watching him, whle agRain lieC dozed away into that deep, deep sleep. He aroused again, "sweet mother, "I am going," said he, "' I wanted to die alone with you."     ; She placed her arn under him, and tenderly raised his Ilead on her bo- i sorl his first, and now his last resting-plafe. "Is Jesus precious?" was her question. "Unspeakably so," was the answer.* He rested there a few moments; looked towards the open window as if he saw something in the golden air. He gave a gasp or two,--his head fell back,- the widow was alone. * This question and reply is a fact.   O^, OUR MUSIC AT DAWN.          81 CHAPTER XIX. NEW TROUBLES. Mrs. Sealove and Miss Jenny Brown were once more in conference in Mrs. Sealove's parlor. But on the usually cllheerfth countenallce of' Mrs. Sealove was an expression of anxiety. The Captain had sailed againl. Was it the absence of her guide, philosopher and friend, whlose choice s;ay- ings were to her as "apples of gold in pictlires of silver?"  Not altogether, as we shall see. The ladies had been sittitlg some timle ildllging in conl- non chat, wheln their minister passed down street. "Have you noticed," said Mrs. Sealove, ,"how troubled( Mr. Mildmay looks lately?" 4"Yes, I have," said Miss Jenny, "its all this temperanlce butsiness; but i i he llad done as I said, he woilld have avoided all this trouble." "Now," said Mrs. Sealove, "you are all ashore, it is lnot that clllrcll mat-' ter is worrying Mr. Mildmay, but if you will not tell a word, 1 will tell you the true cause.  You know Mr. Grenville who married breother Mild- may's sister, has returned from the west, and is settled hecrc, jtlst a mile out of the city. It seems he became intemperate at the west, and thein reform- ed, -and Mr. Mildmay, in order to bring him under home influences, finding there was a fine opening for him here, in his profession, persuaded him to return. Everything looked well at first, till it came about electio time.-- You know Mr. Grenville is a great lawyer, and these lawyers are alwalys politicians-politics and law, somehow ruins together-they are both -a great bother to me; right enough, I suppose, if you could ever get theml right, but somehow they never do get them  right. 'These politics; they llave been chopping and changing, changing and chopping, ever since I canl re- eghmber, and tiey are no ways nigh getting fixed yet." Miss Jollny now liemmed once or twice. "I know what that hem  means," said Mrs Sca- love, "I must keep to my story. Well, the long and the short of it is, C-renville made speeches, and was invited here and there, and went to oys- ter suppers at $ingleton's, and is getting worse and worse, and that is what troables brother Mildmay." "This marrying is all a lottery," said Miss Jenny, sagely, ('many a blank to a prize. Is not Mr. Grenville a fair, florid looking man, and carries him- self with an air?" "Yes," said Mrs. Sealove, "that is his description." "I lhave seen him going into Singleton's very often lately, you know his newe place is not far from where I live." 'I think," said Mrs. Sealove, "it is high time Singleton came under church dealings. I have long thought it was he first entrapped poor Riv- crlv. M!ss Jenny looked important and knowing, but kept Patrick's secret. "Do you know anything ." suspiciously enquired Mrs. Sealove.  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7095-00000047"/> Miss Jenny was provokingly silent. "Singleton," said she, after a pause, "is very much altered; he is getting rich; he don't hang down his head as he used to; he has that kind of a set, darkish smile; yet, depend on it, something awful hangs over him. Is the pretty, dark-eyed child I have seen with Miss Mildmay at Sunday school, Grenville's daughter?" "Yes'" said Mrs. Sealove, "Is she not beautiful?" "Yes, she is handsome," said Miss Jenny, "but what of that, beauty never brings luck, but oftener sorrow and a hard fate. "And now," said Mrs. Sealove, "let us go to tea. I have an early tea this evening, so that we may go down and take a basket of fruit to sister Riverly, who is fast failing." But while we leave them to their tea-taling and charitable walk, let us turn to another scene. *    *   *    *       *   *    *k The sun had gone down, and the moon was rising through a mellow June sky, the crimson richness of the sunset light was losing itself in the yellow glow of the round moon as she rose from behind the hills. A cot- tage situated on a green slope, commanding a distant view of the water, -looked lovely by the soft moonlight. It was apretty place, hid among trail- ing vines and large, old trees. In the door of the cottage, sat in a thought- ful manner, a fair, little maid, about ten years of age. The moonbeams seemed to play lovingly among her flowing, auburn hair, and shone into those sweet, dark eyes, so sad, so thoughtful, for one of such tender years. All day long had Ida Grenville been watching with her mother for her fa,  thers' return ; more anxiously than usual, for the baby darling of the fami.  ly was sick. Alas, grief had dried up the founts from which it drew its life. Ida, her mother and the babe were alone. Her brother had gone out I to enjoy the fine evening, and Ida had, as we have seen, sat down on the doorstep beneath the porch. Ida was a simple "child believer," and the  still tears that glistened in her eyes, were tears of prayer. "'Where are you, Ida?" at length said her mother's voice from within, "do sing for me your evening hymn, it always makes me feel better to hear i you sing."  The gentle child began at once to sing. "IHoly Saviour, when thy sun I)yes with red the Western air, And his race of glory run, ('alls thy little ones to Prayer. Through the lovely fading light Io! my Saviour's face I see; Stooping from his starry height, Speaking words of love to me. Alas, her sweet voice was suddenly interrupted; there was a cry from the road like nothing human; it was like the screech of a demon. Her father was coming towards the house; he picked up something accidentally there,  and came on like a madman. "Fly!" cried Ida, rushing into the house to her mother, "father is coming to kill us; he is mad crazy!" The mother rushed forward towards the door with her babe, but encountered her drunk-   OR, OUR MUSTC AT DAWN.           en husband rushing in, the uplifted axe in his desperate hand, his red, tlrid eyes glaring savagely, every feature expressing his maddening torment.-- "Mercy!" she exclaimed. "Curse you," said he, and springing fiercely for- ward aimed a blow at her with the axe. Ida sprang between them, and the axe descended on her little fair bosom with savage force. Tie wretched mother escaped with her babe at this awful price; for even lie, possesed to Hell's depths with the Rum Demon, he, paused. A ringlet of her aulburn hair was severed by the blow, and caught in the axe as he drew it back dripping with the blood of his child. A faint solund murmured fron her lips; she struggled to say "Forgive!" Tile father gave one strong cry, there' was a momentary pang of consciousness. iBut his son Godfrey, who heard his sister's cry as she fell, now rushed in at the back door, crying out "you have killed my sister!" and grasping as he spoke at the axe his father still held. But his father had the strength of frenzy, and the brave boy struggled in vain. The next instant the life-blood of the noblo boy min- gled with his sisters. There stood the wild ruffian, his eyes glaring around on his cruel work, -when Mr. Mildmay entered wtih two strong men, who seizing and confin- ing him. prevented any further violence. -1elen Mildmay and one of her brothers entered withl their father, who left them to guard the place, while he attended the wretched culprit to the city. It seemed a long and dread. fiul time ere he returned. The brother and sister spake not a. word, ut sat embracing each other and weeping over the ghastly scelec. But at length their father returned, accompanied by Patrick Shannon, whom lie left there until the men should arrive to remove those innocents from the scene of their slaughter. The family of Mr. Mildmay, upon his arrival gathered around to hear the recital of the dreadful event. While he was speaking the carriage arriv- ed with the bodies. "And this," said Mr. Mildmay, as the children gazed on the murdered little ones, "this is the fruits of the innocent business of runn- selling! Children, labor to remove this curse ; labor with your father till it is rooted front the earth. When you would relax the vigor of your war- fare against it, remember these, and let the thought renew your zeal, till the work is done. And remember too, that a] glass of wine talen in dc- ference to custom, may lead to crimes like these." After much good council, Mr. Mildmay returned to the jail. He found Grenville still raving. "There they come!" said the rumll mllrdlerer, "they come! where's my axe? I've got a bloody one! stop! stop! ye infernals, don't drive that dust into my eyes! Hounds too, yelling! the pack have scented me! 'tis rum! ha! ha! see the blaze, the blaze creep up the wall round me, stop! stop!" Then he seemed to fancy himself bound to some wild horse, and shrieked out 'drive on, drive on, ye demons! Ha! ha! she's dead, Singleton, she's dead I There's the lock smut'hed with gore sticking on. Tear it off! they're making chains of fire to bind me to that bloody floor. Dont you see 'em; they leer at me! The blue flames glare and hiss; there's a long long, train of them, all with blue flames!

Then strong imprecations would rush from his lips, such as man has seldom, heard. At last, Mr. Mildmay unable to endure more, re- turned home in a state of mind that taxed all his mighty faith in God. Eudora Grenville was a much loved sister, the companion of his child- hood, and he felt that to one constituted like her, it were an easier fate to have perished at once by the murderer's hand, than to live to endure the lingering agonies before her; for wound about her heart's core was her love of her husband, of which she had given too fatal proof by persisting to live with him after he had become so brutal as to abuse her savagely ; al- though he had never before been so entirely lost as on that night. Her husband was the murderer of her children, dearer to her than life; their father, and their butcher! what a thought. And if she turned from that thought, the jail and the gallows came up in their turn before her, as the probable termination of the life of one formed to be the glory of his coun.. try, and the delight of his friends. Many, many such trophies has the Rum Demon perisling on the highways, rotting in jails, swinging from gibbets!' I t1 A P'T ER   XX.  XX. ANOTHERr VICTIM. ) Endora's infant, in the morning was found to be dangerously ill from the exposure and fright of the night preceding. T'here was little hope that life would last through tie day. The excitement this caused in the mind of the mother, though of a melancholy nature, prevented her from dwelling so intensely as she otherwise would have done, on the events of the past night. Mr. Mildmay knew his call of duty was at the prison, and thither he went. He felt that the trial that awaited him there, would be more severe than what he had experienced the night before, because, now Grenville would have recovered his senses. He went into his cell early in the after- noon, and found himn weak but restored to reason. "Can you tell me," said he, rather sternly to Mr. M1ildmay, "why I am  here? Was it you or Eldora had me placed here?" "Ethbert," said Mr. Mildmay, "I dread to tell you what has placed you here.               a  "What do you mean?" said he with an oath, "I have done nothing." :Oh!" said Mr. Mildmay, "you have done in drunken frenzy, what youI would most abhor to do when yourself."    ORn OUt MUSIC AT DAWN          3 "Tell me,' said Grenville, " in that awtfl name yol, fear, tell me the worst! or are you not making the worst of some paltry brawl? Put no," said he, for he read in Mr. Mildmay's eye that there was nothing trifling in: hand. "No, no, let me see Eudora first; she can tell me! 1 can bear it from her." "Eudora cannot come to you," said Mr. Mildmay, "your dear babe is dying." "Oh!"' said he, covering his face with his hands, "my sweet Emma dy- ing, and I not suffered to go to her. Tell me then what I have done! Ida, where is she? wont she come to see me? cannot I see my own children, my pretty, gentle Ida, always loving, respectful, forgiving; it is very hard, let me see her, I say." Mr. Mildmay shrunk from the task he had to perform, but he knew none could do it less harshy.. "You will see your little Ida no more," said he, "nor your noble boy Godfrey. You went home in a fit of delirium tremens." "And what?" exclaimed Grenville. "'Yo,1 took the lives of your own children." "Mildmay," said the prisoner, "you know this is false ; I never could have done it. You are playing this desperate game with me to frighten me from drinkingl, bt drink, drink I must have, I am raging for it now; the bare mention of it sets me wild! I will have it, if it burns up my soul. Mildmay, get me some drink; you cruel wretch to fasten me up here, and then lie to me, so foully. I never killed! Oh! millions for a glass of rum!" Mr. Mildmay felt that the case required extreme means. That nothing but some ocular demonstration of his crime would break up the strong spelt of the Rum Fiend. His pale victims he could not see, but on the evening previous, before the bloody axe was given up to the officers of justice, Mr. Mildmay had removed the lock of hair that had adhered to the axe. He had wrapped it in paperl, and lie now recollected that it was still in his pocket-book. h'at sight might reach and smite down the still almost om- nipotejlt, selfishhess of appetite. "i)o you know that hair?" he said, extending the lock toward Gren- ville, with a trembling hand, and a face blanched to the paleness of death with emotion. "Oil! ves. 1 lo! it is Ida's! Ida's!

Oh! for Christ's sake, tell me once, once, I did not kill her! ' "Grenville be calm," said Mr. Mildmay, though bursting into tears him- self, as-he spoke, and weeping with the strong passion of a man, "you knew not what you did. God will forgive you as I do, most sincerely, most tru- ly. Ethbert, have I not always been your friend?" "Indeed you have," said Grenville.

Think what I,--a father, must feel, to be: compelled to show a father such a sight as that!, If that has not reached you, all my words, t even an angel's words, would be vain." The culprit turned his face to the wall. The fearful certainty rushed upon him. Strong tremors shook his frame, and his groans were as from one oppressed with a burthen too great to sustain. But Mr. Mildmay was an experienced physician of souls. He sought not to allay the wholesome agonies of remorse. He knew the pain must spend itself before the least consolation could be received. To talk of Jesus and His pardoning pow- er, would, at this period, be in vain. The throes of the travail must pre- cede the birth. It is the law of nature; it is the law of grace. The overwhelming consciousness of guilt, absorbed his soul,-- and such a crime! I know not that there is a term to denote this crime, perhaps because so un- natural, but if the rum traffic continues, the frequent recurrence of the crime will create a necessity for some name to designate it. After some time Mr. Mildmay opened the Bible, and read the fifty-first Psalm. Grenville repeated after him, "Against Thee, Thee only have I sin- ned," with deep emotion. Prayer came next, and while the man of God wrestled, the sinner's tears dropped to the floor. But Mr. Mildmay was hastily summoned home by the death of the child. He never again saw the prisoner alive. The reaction after that fit of delirium tremens, resulted in sudden death by apoplexy. Eudora was left a childless widow, but she was too frail long to survive these dreadful events. She faded silently away, and went down to an early grave, CHAPTER      XXI. PATRICK SHANNON. the tnorning after the awful scenes detailed in the iast chapter, Patrick Shannon was passing along the streets and Miss Jenny, who had heard something of the sad event, called to him from her window, and asked him if he was able to give her a correct report of the terrible affair. Patrick had not yet learned the sad death of Grenville, but as we have seenj had been in a situation to ascertain the true history of the tragical events in the cottage. "Isn't it myself has been in it the evening, and took the caies of the un- fortunate childers. Och, Miss Jenny," said he, taking out a big, coarse handkerchief, and wiping his plentiful tears,. as he sat down, to relate the   OR, OUR MUSIC AT DAWN.          9 story, " it would be making the stones to wape, to be looking on there.- The greatest, horridest sight, Miss Jenny, and pitiful intirely." ," Which of his children, or how many did he kill?" asked Miss Jenny. "Ah! yees must wait, Miss Jenny; it just kills my heart quite, to spake of them. But listen, till ye hear. I was going home from my work late, when who should I see but Mr. Mildmay, for as the moon was bright it was asy to tell him. He's always so quiet in himself, it bothered me to see him going over the ground so fast, and he looked feared some way, and first says I to myself, if this ain't Mr. Mildmay; he is not himself, anyhow, but shure something has come over him, belike he's gonen mad! He comes right up to me, Patrick,' says he, ' it's luck to meet ye,' (he out of breath, intirely, and drawing in theair daper than a hard trotted horse.) And what does your honor's riverince want? says I. 'Oh!' says he,' Patrick, there hasMbeen bloody work up at my sister's cottage yonder.' And the husband? says I for my mind misgave me about Grenville. ' He is in prison,' says Mr. Mildmay, ' it was him did the dade.' Och! it struck me through, that I thrimbled in myself to that degree, I was ready to rowl along the ground. I was that wake, and not able to spake, but says I, where's your riverincoe going now?? ' Back to the house,' says he, ' for my daughter, buttwe must stop on our way to White's, for a carriage; she is not able to walk.' So we wint on,-- he laves the carriage down on the road, and we walked up to the house. I was loth to be going, for I had iver a dread of murther.- But we got there, shure. Poor Miss Helen sat watching the dead; upon my sowl I thought she would faint in the father's arms; and the moon,- inercy save us! was all the light down upon that bloody murther. There was they, lying like twro lambs, and the divil himself could do no worse than that, to murther the likes of thim erathurs ; and it's a poor excuse, the Rum, for a dade like that, for what call has a man to pour the dirty fire-water down his throat till he's the divil intirely, and slaughtering his own child- er? Ah! shure one of thim was the sweetest lass that iver sucked the mother's milk, and the other, a big, brave, bowld, beautiful boy. It was me that 1ilped set the house up whin they first wint in it; as pretty a fami- ly as iver a man called himself father too. Och! that's the dirty liquor should prove the death of thim darlints! So Mr. Mildmay, taking off his daughter, told me to watch a few moments till the min came up to remove the bodies. So there I was, all alone with thim dead innocents, and while I was there waiting, I bethinks me all of a sudden of the kay to all this,-- but the holy saints be wid us! it will niver do to till, jist, for is n't the whole city like a bunch of tow, about it? and a word would be a match to 'light it. That we may be kipt from ivery evil thing!" "Tell me," said Miss Jenny, " you never knew me to tell anything." "Ah! but this is another thing intirely; 'tis a matter of life and death, shure, and sorrow on the day iver Patrick Shannon got blood on his skirts forbye it might be Satan, who has niver a throp shure, or Sim Singleton himself." "Has Singleton anything to-do with this?" asked MBiss Jenny, "I thnk he hlas."  &#xD;<pb n="96" xml:id="VAC7095-00000050"/> 96             THE REVEILLE: "Niver let on what you think, thin, Miss Jenny, if you dont't want a muss and a murther, so near yoursilf, but shure you're a great one to find out whose back has the fit of the saddle." "Since I know who it is," said Miss Jenny, " you might as well tell me how it was." "Ah! Miss Jenny, it's yoursel' that's able to be coaxing a secret out of the wisest son of a ;vowran 'hat iver carriedi hair upon is head. Then- ye can kape it as good as ye can coax it; so thin for the life of your sovrl ye'll not mintion it?"                          "No,- you may rely upon my word," answered Miss Jenny. "Well, thin, 'tis rising a week, since I heard thim tT o :!lckguards, agin, talking over their affairs. First I thought I woui!L.'t be hearkcning,-:nay be it wasn't right thin, and sure it stirred my blood that way, it wa- n nt asy to kape from going to Aghting.

' Divil a piece,' says Singleton,--- " 'C He did n't say that," said Miss Jenny, '"I never heard Singleton use a  bad word." "Thin he does use bad words now."                . C But he has not got up so glib as that," said Miss Jenny.  Did n't my own father,- the turf be light upon him,-- tell me when I was a gossoon, and he catched me swearing, and whipped me for it, so that the memory remains wid me. ' Pat,' says he, ' whit tihe divil takes ye 2 into his service, he soon learns ye his language.' But,' says Ready, 'I 'll tell you the way to fix Grenville,- get him dead, dead drunk, and fleece i his pockets.- I know,' says the vagabond, 'a mixture that will make hrim  mad drunk.' Says Singleton, ' it will be hard doing that, for Miid ry is s on the watch to see if he is there.' But these two agreed to 1have a Lit of a supper in one of Singleton's back parlors,- some dainty picce,---u-:d .nvite him, and then timpt him on. So Miss Jenny, it was them two r1chbrs that thrapped the poor sowl, and sint him out a murthering; andt tli bl, ood of thim innocints, is on the black sowls of thim, more nor on h m, and. on the sowls of all the gineration that's in the fashion of selling this bad stamT, that's desthroying the world intirely, so it is.

There was a gathering of the Rum Club at their vwolted place of session the day after the funeral of (Irelnville and his children.  Stronghead, the leader of tins worthly fraternity, was ultimate with Grey, Igland, Moreland and others of the upper class of liquor dealers; but thse gentry though willing to avail themlselves of the dirty knavery of such stool-pigeons as Singleton and Ready, did not care to mingle with them. Stronghead was a convenient connecting link, and through him the influence and gold of these atristocrats flowed to the lesser satellites, which, added to his own am- 1,ie mealns, g'ave him great sway. Hal Wood and Rlocllileart came in first. They all agreed that matters had been driven too fast with (rrcnville ; they thought it would have been more politic, and as Stronllglead philanthroli- cally observed, more humane, to hlave kelpt him alonllg gettinlg him moder- ately drunk every day.  " Mildmay is makiqng great capital out of that (;reuville affair," said Stronghead. "I suppose," said Rockheart. "lie will expect to carry all before him next chuirchl meetitng." "He will," said Stronghead, "lpovided lie does not drive matters too fast. He has said since this affair, he is satisfied he has not begun to do his duty as a Christian minister in this cause." "Let him drive ahead then," said Hal Wood, "it is tle beautly 0ol these crazy reforiners, that they push on ahead of tlhe people,, and so defeat their own purposes." "Anyhow, I am sorry he has gained such an adlvantage,' said Stronghcead "'Singleton has not showni his usual prudence, and as to Ready, he always drives on Jehu like."  Singlqton and Ready just then entered ; Ready with that peculiar deci- ant cock of the hat and menacing sparkle of tle eye, which annoullced his readiness for a fight if deemed by him nlecessary. "What are we to do now ?" said Stronghead to thlle, "this G(reiville al- fair ias brought a slarp crisis right down uponl us." "What to do !" says Ready. "lth lfirst thling to do is to )ay Sillltoln for IJ13r--13  I  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7095-00000052"/> 98             THEi REVEILLE: his work. You were all alive to help bring dlown Grenville ; you thought it would show up this temperance fuss right at Mildmnays own door. The man is disgraced and dead, and you are grumbling/; it lays at our doors, our shops are in danger of mobs; Singleton's and nline, not yours, and we want onr pay." Stronghead instantly pulled out his long purse, rich to repletion with. liquor gains; not that he dreaded Ready at all, for he was not thie man to flinch for trifles, but he prided himself on his liberality. Giving Singlctonl several gold pieces, and then bestowing such q largess on Ready as at once softened the menace of his eye, lie made him sit down, and lay down by his side the belligerent hat, althoulgh there yet remained within something of the rowdy disposition in which he had entered. "'What in the world made Grenville rush on so fast?" said Strongthead to Sinigleton. "It was the opening of an old sore," said Singleton, "'he had been a d(rulk-  ard before, and these temperance 'folks are stirriiig ip such a fuss, just as if. there was never anybody killed before by a man in liquor." "There's one thing I feel a little curious to know," said Rockhlcart, "and that is, where he got his last dram t"' "That's best known to him, and them that sold it to him," said Readv fiercely, "and it's nobody else's - business. I don't think you nlCd i the receipt of it, Rockheart, I guess you know well how to qualify a drail; ; the sailors say you do." "Don't be huffy,"' said Rockheart, "I1 meant nothing." "But the worst of it is," said Stronghead, "this tiling works righit in favor of Mildmay and the temnlerance cause, and ths too, just as we thhouglt we were bringing things round to get him out of the wuay. I an afraid We cannot do much now. tie will stay, and we can do nothiing aga1inst hill preaching." "Nevcr fear," said Singleton, "lhe is so temperance nmadl, he will cut l:is own throat, as the sayin:g is. People, tlhat have heard liini!atlvy, say tait t he is wrought up to altigh pitch, and though lie is migthty calm in cC nmncn, hie nmay do some rash thiing now le is excited." "Htave you seen him since tie ffahir?" said Stronghead. :No," said Singleto: , "I went away t the time, and have just returned,  but lie called to see me a day or two before this happened, and so did Still- worm. I reckon it was a kind of a pre!ace to churching me, because I have : not asked THEM whether I  should sell a glass of wine or not." "Indeed," said Stronghead, "do give us the items of it." 1"Wcll," said Singleton, "it was pretty latcishi in the evening, somebody  rang, I went, and there was Mildmay. 'I should like to see you alonei,' said, he. We went intoa private room, and then lie opened his business% and the substance of what he said' was, that hl could not valk in follow- ship with me while I was in the runm traffic. Says I, brother Mildmany,  you are very particullir with me, that is just getting along in thie world, have : you ever been to see AM. Grey or Mr. Bigland on the subject.?

It is my way, says 1, Mr. Mildrnay, to cotnfss to God, not man; if you've got to be a Catholic Priest, and expect to have me tell you, sitr what [ do, and what I don't do, I'd as good's be. a Papist. lve got so I hate p)ristcraft, and this temperance business is one half piriestcraft, and t'other halt' bluster and nonsense. Mildmay never saw me show that much slpunk before, and he looked amazed, but I kept on. Moreover, says I, if youll hatvel been to these great folks, I should like to know w;hiat they said. '! air as much of a Pather Confessor as thal, said lie, smilnig, that I should not feel at liberty to tell what was said to me in p)rivate contfereces.' 'I'lice suid I, Mr. Mildmay, if it suits you to believe little tittle tattles, nboult meit, that I am a eommon grog seller, you are at liberty to do so. Youl say, si, you cannot walk with me, and I nmst say, since you set about pulling the,  church to pieces, I don't like to walk with you ; 'mand you know sir, good oltl Deacon Olden, and some of the most substantial brethlren in the cim-rcll are of lily mind, though we have put upl with a great deal for peace sake.- 'Pirst pItre, the!n peaceable,' said lie, and so went o01 with his sort of preaclh- ing, but I minded it no more than a p1mlfof wind. The next evening, like the Devil in Scripture, that came back wit}h seven other spirits more wick- ed thait himself, he comes in with i)eacon Stillwormn." "T'lat lien-pecked old traitor," said Stronghead, "I would iot have suf- fered himin to darken my door." "Brother in the church," said Singleton, "however I never asked thelm to sit downi, but they took scats tlemselves. They let off a long rigmarole -Deacon Stillworm had it, that run sclling was no better than mu rdner.- I heard them awliile, and says 1, gentlemen I hlave a press of' business tliis evennlg.1; I have heard'about all I want to, and I nmust be a moving ; if you like to sit here and cool yoturselves, you canll stay as long as you wish. So 1 left them and, went about my business ; but as Nabby rwas i  t and out, in the pantry which stands between the kitchen ,nd time room they were in, wilt do you thinik she liheard them say?" "PLity tell us," said Stroglghead. "Who they were talking about, that I leave ; 'But,' says the Deacon, 'he seems dillerent firom wlat lie used to be ; if lie lhad onlysliowi as mnuchl sptirit in co'nfirence mneetiigs, folks would have liked to have heard him ibet- tor ; theol he always s0poke very demurely, :and slow, and so sleepy it was te- dious to hear hiina.'

You can see nc- counts in almost auy newspaper, full up t'l0"his; nobody thinks anything about it, more than for the time passing, only this is right among ourselves. and another tiling, this happened among the high class, ilstead of the poor- er, so it makes more noise. If it had been in a shanty, it would'nt hlave made much stir. A sailor went out of my store a while ago and stabled a man, and it made no great noise; both now are in jail; and there's an end of it. I cannot help it, men will have liquor, and liquor kills men, but pow- der kills more, and who finds fault with a powder seller. There a'nt a thing you can take hold of in the way of business, but somebody or other will pick flaws. Grenville was just the man to drink himself mad, and the uworld's no worse off without him. I prophecy to you, ths thing will be the more dead a month helnce, for all this temperance excitement.'  "My view," said Stronghead, "is, that our wisest course is to keep pretty quiet, and let this Inatter work off."               . "None of your keeping quiet for me," says Ready, getting up and throw- ing his hat on cavalierly, and striding about the room, "Jim Ready will act for himself, murder or no murder. i'm going on dead smash into this business, and by the blazes, I'll see it out. I'd sell rum now, if I sold it a cent a gallon. I'd give it away, to help on. That's the all-fired stufflJim Ready's made of.

Helen had forgotten all about the cloud, and the danger of its rising. but now she saw, as she was a distance from home, the tempest might overtake her;-for the wings of the tempest were already ( slIread abroad in the north. Helen thought she knew of a shorter path home than the common road; she entered this road, as she thought, but havingc walked on some distance, found she had taken the wrong direction. The sky was now black with heavy clouds; Helen paused to consider what must be done. She resolved to walk back to the cemetery, and take from thence the known and familiar route home. . As she reached the cemetery there camle a terrible flash of lightning.-- As it was past sunset, and the air very black, it became quite dark. TIhe wind now seemed to blow from every poitlt of the compass, and howled - among these chambers and halls of death. The lightning flashed incessant- ly, bolt after bolt rent the clouds ; sheets of rain descended ; Helen strug- gled bravely on her way, looking amidst the fierce tempest like some wain- dering guardian angel of the dead. She had more tils vision-like iappLear- ance, as the warmth and pleasantness of the afternoon had induced her to wear a white dress, and she had ont her head a large white sun-bonntlt which she usuall wore when on her summer walks.  Sle wallked on re- ' peating inwardly the beautiful verses, ", The God who rules on high, and thunders when he please,  Who rides upon the stormy sky, and manages the seas."  This awful God is ever our father arnd our love. Helen did not fear the tempest, but now sle saw emerging f:om one of I the shaded alleys of the cemetery, some person, she could nIct wedl distit-  guish who, iad this gave her some apprehension, for she felt unwillill to :i meet a stranger in that lonely place, at such a time. She therefore quicken- k  ed her step almost to a run. Shle had nearly reached the gate of the ccrne- tery, when she heard a voice behind her, amidst warring winds, and break- ; ing thunders, crying, "Stop! stop! Miss Mildmay, I have an umbrella, allow me to protect you." She knew the voice, it was Edward Gray's. -; S}le had never seen him since he gave her the twenty dollars at iis aunlt j Gray's. He soon joined her; she thanked him, with some emlbarrasshent. Reader, I have told you I would not write a love-story, and therefore the  thronging thoughts and feelings of this unexpected rencontre, I leave to your imagination. They walled along rapidly and almost silently, until a tremendous burst of thunder came volleying down the heavens. "You do not seemn to be at all alarmed Miss Mildmay," said Edward .! Grey.  'No," said Helen, " but I feel awed. God draws nearer at such times.' .: "But have you no dread that the lightninog may strike you?" said he. i ,' The occurrence is so rare, that few people really dread it," answered g Helen. '1I have never thought that it might happen to mie, but it is saidd in the. Word, 'Nor life, nor death, nor any other creature can separate us : froln the love of ,(od, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.' ' ^P;   OR,. OUR MUSIC AT [DAWN.         10 The simplicity and true feeling with which this was uttered, redeemed it from any appearance of affectation of piety, though Edward had not been accustomed to hear scripture quoted by the gay belles of his circle. But the time, the place, the maiden, and the sublime scriptre promise, were all in harmony, and lie felt for the first tinme convinced by her serene trust that there was something higher, more worthy of us, than the beggarly ele- ments of the present life. The sudden, terrific squall now began to clear as suddenly, and the pale moon came out through the broken electric clouds, which ever and alnon still sent a red flash along the heavens. They now reached the parsonage, and Edward reluctantly parted from his fair conlp)atioi.  /CHAPTER    XX V. A FIEtY TRIAI. One morning Mrs. Sealove was very much surlprised by the entrance of Helen Mildmay. "My dear child," said Mrs. Sealove, "1 an rejoiced to see you again ; but I hope nothing las happened unpleasant that causes you to come back so unexpectedly?' "Nothing very pleasant," said Helen, "but let me throw off my bonnet and I will tell you what has happened. You know, I suppose, that the Iarsonage, (so called) is not owned by the church, but is loaned for the use of the pastor by Mr. Bigland?" "Yes," said Mrs. Sealove, "I am aware of that." "Mr. Bigland," said Helen, "wrote to my father, saying that he wished him to remove from the house; for he wisled to make alterations and ad- ditions, in case they called a new pastor, or for him, if le should remain.- My father had to come directly. I would not allow Mother to return, and weary herself with the fatigue of moving, just as she is recruiting so fast in the country, so I have come in her place." "It is a shame, a burning shame," said Mrs. Scalove, "how I wish the Captain was here to be a friend to you now. But where is your father?" "Gone directly to look for a house; because as our goods were put in compact, moveable order, before we went in the country, he thought if he procured a house to day, we might have the goods moved in, and leave to-morrow." As she finished speaking, her father entered. "Not got a place already?" said Mrs. Sealove. "Yes," said Mr. Mildmay, "I have been very successful in getting DUa- on liStillworm's new house, which otherwise would have been let to-mor- row, "  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7095-00000056"/> 106            THE REVEIILLE '  "What, that pretty place next to his new hall, built on the ground xwhere e the old distillery stood"?" "Yes, tnat is the place! But I suppose, Helen," said Mr. Mildmay, "'we r must now go directly to the parsonage; I want to make as little stir in lthe  city about this strange proceeding as possible. '         "Let me put on my things," said Mrs. Sealove, "and go and help you;  and after all is done, you both return and passithe night here." ' By evening, all the goods of Mr. Mildmay were transferred to their new ii abode, and Helen and her father returned to the home of their hospitable friend. Mrs. Sealove was only too happy to have the good man under her roof, ,i but regretted that the Captain had not yet arrived. "Some people," said I? she, to Mr. Mildmay, "find fault with the resolution you offered in the last : church meeting; they say the tares and wheat must grow together till the I end." "But," answered Mr. Mildmay, "our Lord does not say, 'the field is the g church,' but 'the field is the world.' We expect common human infirmities  in church members, but not systeinaic iniquity. The prophets and apos- g tles strenuously maintain the purity of the church. 'She shall be fair as : the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners."'  "Another thing," said Mrs. Sealove, "they say, you would do great good : by remaining, even at the price of giving way a little; and to tell the truth,  I am such a poor creature, and love so well to have you among us, that it  seemed to me, if you could yield a little, perhaps it would not be so very i wrong." I  "Now, do you not know, my good friend," said Mr. Mildmay, "that I can ll do nothing without Christ? If I do not his will, he will not work by Il e, and his will is the purity of the church. Read the message to the churcll-  es, in the Revelations, and see how very near the purity of the church is to ii the heart of Christ. Does he not say to the lukewarm Laodicean church, 'I will spew thee out of my mouth.' How long would the savor of life re-  main in my preaching, after I had made a truce with sin?"    "I see you are right," said Mrs. Sealove, "but I do not look so deep into K things as you do." "I want you, dear sister Sealove, always to look beyond the servant to his Master. I have often been fearful, from the very strong affection many 1 of my flock have shown me, that they might think too highly of an humble i and unworthy instrument." "Ah!" said Mrs. Sealove, "we love you, because we see so much of the  Master in you."  After much pleasant conversation, swe6t singing, and united communion with God, they parted for the night. In the dead of the night there was an alarm of fire, but as Mr. Mildmay was much fatigued with the exertions of the preceeding day, he did not rise to go to it, and the ladies perceiving it was in another quarter of the city, kept quiet. Little did the Mildmays think what consequences that fire could have for them ; but they were all greatly surprised, and shocked in the morning, to learn that the parsonage !   OR, OUR MUSIC AT DAWN.          107 they had just left, had been burnt to the ground the preceeding night. It was evidently the work of some desperate incendiary, havihg been set on fire in several parts. "What a providence," said Mr. Mildmay, "in our moving yesterday." "Now who could be bad enough to do that?" said Mrs. Sealove, "it was meant to destroy your property, if not your lives; for but a few kliew of your removal." Mrs. 5ealove tried to detain her friends, but Mr. Mildmnay and his daugh- ter left that morning. The sudden burning of the parsonage was considered a very mysterious affair in the city, especially as connected with the removal of the incumbent. What audacicus use Mr. Mildmay's enemies were disposed to nmake of it, may be seen by the following paragraph from the paltry editor we have be- fore mentioned: "Last night the parsonage of the   Church was totally destroyed by fire. It was evidently the work of an incendiary. The reverend cham- pion of the temperance cause, the redoubtable Mr. Mildmay, having liad it politely hinted to him by the insulted and highly respectable owner of the house he occupied as a parsonage, that lie must remove, transDorted all his sacred goods and chattels to another house the very day previous to the fire. Comment is unnecessary." This libellous little squib was not without its desired effect. Calumny, the daughter of Envy, like Death, loves a shining mask. There is no lie too extravagant for hatred to believe. Mr. Mildmay was in that city a burning and a shining light. The peo- ple felt the effects of his continued ministry, in giving a tone to public opin- ion. But his enemies, (and they were the enemies of righteousness,) used his absence to darken up the moral air, with the smoke of the pit, in the shape of their false and malicious assertions. Many eagerly received the tales, backed up as they were by the crafty insinuations of time powerfil meln, who sought the ruin of the meek, but faithful pastor. Nor were there wanting plausibly constructed falselhoods, branching from the main lie, to give plausibility, and credibility to' the story. Singleton was especially busy, "he did not like to talk about his minister, not he-lie did not like to think it possible Mr. Mildmay could do such a thing ; but he had seen him round the parsonage late on the evening, before the fire. People didn't know the man, as well as lie did; he had seen him when he was off his guard; he had heard him say, in respect to this very Mr. Bigland, 'tlhat lie would see the day he would be sorry he had ever opposed iim.'" Thus the story grew, and other stories were tacked on to it. Not only all tlhe worldly, and especially the dissolute part of society, ]r )progated it, but alas, it got secret countenance from those to whost time-serving professions, and lukewarm piety, his honesty and earnestness, had been a severe rebuke. Mr. Mildmay's friends were aware of the change going on in the public mind. They well knew that any apprehension tliythc crime could be im- puted to him, had never visited his milnd. They wrote to him, and telling him the popular rumor, and its effects, urged his immediate return. But  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7095-00000057"/> 108            THE REVEILLE:             g his heart-broken sister Endora, was now on her deatn-bed, and he would  not leave her. Strong in conscions innocence, perhaps, like many other E good people, he was too indifferent to censure at any time, but now more M particularly, when the calumny was in itself so incredible and so mons-  trous. His answer to his friends was, that committing his cause to God, he I should calmly remain at his present post of duty, till his dear sister was re-  leased.  Let us leave him at present in the peace which the world cannot take i:  away, and peep in a few moments upon the Rum Club, in secret session. "Never saw anything like it," said Stronghead, "the tide is turned so, I i don't know but the people would mob Mildmay, if he attempted to come t back just now."  "But I should like to know," said Wood, "who did the deed, for we all  know, here among ourselves, that Mildmay never had any hand in it." "Know what, here among ourselves?" said Ready, I am the man, will ; swear, here and every where else, that that scoundrel did it; Sin-  gleton knows lie did it-why don't you speak, Singleton?" "I am ready to stand to what you say," said Singleton.  "That a'nt enough ;" said Ready, "come, out with what you know." Singleton, not daring to refuse Ready, went into quite an ingenious cir- cumstantial lie, as to his having watched Mildmay round the house, and  seen him lingering just where the fire broke out. To say the truth, even Singleton felt a little qualmish, every time he went through with this false  invention; but Ready made him not only repeat it, but affirm it, after he  had done; and Wood was polite enough, to desist from further enquiries of t that kind. "'Whoever did it," said Rokkheart, "it was a great thing for us ; but was  Bigland insured?"  "Yes," said Singleton, "to the full value of the house. Mildmay must  needs come to the next church meeting; he has had his case put off one month, and it must come on now, and then we shall have it all our own way, and he will be ousted." "That is capital," said Rockheart; "I am not hard-hearted, but I should like to see the man that tried to ruin our trade, brought to a morsel of bread." "I should like to blow him up," said Ready. "How does Jerry Woodliffe come on?" said Stronghead, "have you made  him drunk yet?" "No!" says Singleton, "since the engine supper, he is very shy; I don't i thinlk anything will fetch him uip." "Keep it up," said Stronghead, "when you have started your game, don't give up the chase. Every reformed inebriate that falls to his cups again,  goes to prove this temperance work a mere sham. And every man who makes a stout stand against temptation, helps more than twenty lectures, to build it up. Now Jerry, one way or another, has foiled us very often, and he must be brought down." With this mandate, the session ended.    OR, OUR MUSIC AT DAWN.          10} CHAPTER     XXVI. EDWARD GREY Edward Grey was the only son of a wealthy banker in London, by h first wife. His second wife was an English lady of wealth, who added two daughters to his family. Being an American himself, and very enthu- siastic in respect to the institutions and destiny of his native country, he re- solved to have his son brought up in America, receiving there a part of his education, and completing his studies in Europe. That accomplished, lie was to return to America, study a profession, and live a citizen of this re- public. Mr. Grey was a stern and peculiar man, and had not the least idea that the will of a child could ever, possibly interfere with his plans. Just about the time of the events recorded in our last chapter, he visited his friends in America, his chief object being to see his son, and arrange his future plans for him. His half brother's wife, Mrs. Cora Moore, was an off-hand commonplace woman, and had little attraction for her nephew. But his sister-in-law, Mrs. Grey, was a more artful, capable woman, and had considerable influ- ence over his son. Mrs. Gray having some little private schemes of her own, kept a watchful eye over Edward's fancies. With a woman's sagacity in such matters, she saw under all his romancing about Helen Mildmay, the workings of a deeper feeling than passing admiration. The accidental meeting at the cemetery, of which he made no secret, but confirmed h)er suspicions, and after that meeting, his increasing thoughtfulness, added to her convictions that it was time for her to act, if she meant to stop the atfair. The opporlune arrival of her brother-in-law, put the direct means in her hand to do so. "I am very much pleased," said he to his sister, "to think how finely lEdward has grown; then his scholarship meets my expectations. Indeed, he pleasos me in every respect." "Yes," said Mrs. Grey, "and it would be a pity, if he should spoil all by forming an improper connexion." "Connexion!" exclaimed Mr. Grey, "that boy, that stripling, think of forming any connexion! what do you mean, sister?" "I suppose I might as well tell you at once, that there isreally some dan- ger of such a thing." "With whom?" said Mr. Grey, "please tell me the circumstances?" "DI)o not be excited about it," said Mrs. Grey, "and I will tell you; and your sister, Cora Moore, will confirm all I say. You remember last evening  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7095-00000058"/> "O            THE REVEILLE : we were speaking of our pastor, .his strange colrse, and the iimputations  under which lie labors at present; anld you may have observed how warm-" ly Edward defended him ; it is his eldest daughter, for wholm Edward cx-  presses such great admiration, and whom, I can see, he really prefers to any  other young lady." "His daughter!" said Mr. Grey, "the daughter of a canting parson, pro-  bably an incendiary! a very creditable affair, truly."; "Have patience, brother, it is but in an embryo state yet, and Edward ^. las the Grey spirit; I should advise mild but firm measures.'    i "Just tell me how far the matter has progressed?" said Mr. Grey, ll"has  the young fool offered himself to the girl?"       '  "No! no, by no means!" said Mrs. Grey, "he rarely sees her except at  9hurch. He had a chance meeting the other day, however, with the lady.'" "I will talk with Edward this morning," said Mr. Grey, "when I return to England in autumn, perhaps I shall think it most prudent, after this il- u formation, to take him with me. Will you tell Edward wheni he comes inl to come to me in the library?" said he as he left the room.   s Edward returned from a walk soon after. His aunt told him his father's request, and he repaired to the library.  "Edward," said Mr. Grey, "how should you like to return with me to  England?" "I should prefer," said Edward "to remain here, till I have finished my  collegiate course, and I have always thought sir, that was your settled plan."  "I have but one objection to your remaining here," said Mr. Grey, "I  fear, from what I have heard, that there is some danger of your making a { fool of yourself. Now Edward, I tell you at once, never think of forming i;i any particular attachment, however honorable, till you have completed your : education, and entered a profession; if you do, I shall disinherit you. Con- -?s sider this as final; no alteration ; not a hairs breadth in my will, on this sub- ject, never. I am astonished, at your age, you should thinkl of such a tiling. I thought you had more sense ; and especially am I mortified at your taste, in selecting the daughter of one of these clerical enthusiasts, wlho has been pursuing a very improper course here, even if he is not (as you  maintain) guilty of the crime attributed to him. If you ever wish to see  my face again, if you care for my affection; if you expect one cent in fu- ture from me, you must have no further intercourse with her."     "Father ;" said Edward, "I had no idea that I was in love ; it isall news S to me; but if to bow with pure and high admiration, at the shrine of the most matchless beauty, and perfect human goodness is a sin, that sin is mine; and I think Sir, if yon could see Miss Mildinay, you would not wonder at the homage. I am not alone, but she retires from the admiration of all the youth of the city, to serve her God, and you need not interpose your command. Father, Helen Mildmay is too good for mec; I might as well think to wed 'some bright particular star.'" "There, you need not say any more;" said his father, "I see you had better return with me to Europe." *   *    *   *    *   *   .*   *1t I    OR, OUR MUSIC AT DAWN.          1 I Let us return to Mr. Mildmay, vzho reached the city very late on the evening of the church meeting, and entered the church il the midst of the mIeting. Every living soul, who had ever been a member of the clhurch, was present, great anxiety being felt to see how Mr. Mildmay would look and act under this new p)hase of his life. The liquor trade partisans ex- pected to see him chopfallen: Some rabidly ignorant peoplle, who really believed hm guilty, came to feast their morbid appetites on the sight of so arch a criminal; his true and constant friends were also out in full force.- IBt Mr. Mildmay's countenance was no more disturl cd than the deep se- rene of heaven, on a still summer evening. He took his seat as usual. His own case was in discussion, and they were about to take the vote. He forbore to speak, until the vote had been taken, and, as was to be expected, had gone against him ; then he rose to speak. There was at the beginning a slight-tre mulousness of the voice, and a tear was seen to roll down lhis cheek, but he soon recovered his wonted self-possession, and said,- To the party who have voted agaiiist me, 1 will say,'friends I am more grieved for your sakes than my own. If you had dismissd me for 4icoin- petence, want of zeal or ability to fill the office of your pastor, (here his voice grew firmer) anly moral delinquency originated this movement, it wollld be far dillerent; but you reject me because I have told you the truth. Christ, who is essentially the truth, has said of his servants, 'whoever re- jecteth you, rejccteth me.' My Savior has pleaded through me for the poor drunkard's priceless soul, against your lust of gain, and you have cast Htini out in casting me out, who am an humble messenger of ILis truth.-- I know nothing but darkness, veiling darkness, must follow where liglt is thus shut out. I pray God, your next pastor may be yet more faithfll in warning you than I have been. His ability as a pastor may transcend mine, - llis love never can. I hold no resentment, I only regret your blindness. I know how far your leaders have urged you on in this affair; I have heard all the strange calumnies in circulation,- perhaps I ought to feel concerned about them, but they have not at all disturbed my tranquillity. If I thought they would hurt the blessed cause of Christ, I shou'd not be thus calm;- but that cause and its servants ever come out the brighter from such ordeals. ihough the furnace should be heated seven times hotter." "To you, my dear and true friends, who have continued with me in nly struggle, on whose love as well as on my Savior's promises I have reposed my tried soul, how shall I say the parting word. To meet you thus this evening, awakens a variety of emotions. I see your dear faces, after this brief absence, but ah! I see them to bid you farewell. No more shall our voices, here mingle in prayer or praises, no more shall we me^t in the en- dealing relation of pastor and people. But friends, is our spiritual commu- nion broken? Can it be? Never! never! As Christ is always with his people, so are they always with one another in Him. Baptised into the one spirit, every Christian when he prays, feels his praying breath mingle with the incense of the whole family in heaven and earth. I)car friends, we can know no real separation, so long as we abide in Him. Remember Christ's xords,-' I in tIhem, and tlhl' in Me, that we may be made perfect in --.   &#xD;<pb n="112-105" xml:id="VAC7095-00000059"/> 12             THE RnEVEILLE: One.'

Only remember to re- tain the pure testimony; make no compromise with sin; think not lightly of your sacred connecting link, even the body and blood of the Lord, spir- itually and mystically given in the Holy Communion." He ceased to speak, for there was loud sobbing in all parts of the room, and he felt his own voice breaking, and ready to mingle withl the rest.- Several of thelmalcontents having gratified their malice by their vote, had been dropping out ever since the vote was taken ; rather prematurely, for a man now entered, and passing up the aisle, gave a note to Mr. Mildmay.- On reading it, Mr. Mildmay displayed much emotion. He rose and said, "Our dear sister Riverly sleeps in Jesus. I will read this note from sister Woodliffe, which has just been handed me. 'Dear Pastor, our dear sister, Lucy Riverly has passed away from this troublesome world. I was sent for by her, early this afternoon, as she was suddenly taken very ill. I went, and found her in a dying state, but perfectly tranquil. The particulars of her last moments, I will give you at another time; but I write now, to state to you the dying request of our beloved sister; that her body should be taken to the church of which she was so long a member, and that you should preach her funeral sermon." Mr. Eildm'ay puased after reading the note, then said:--',At any time, this news would have been painful to me, but especially under the circumstances under which the vote of this ever- ing has placed me. I am by that vote, precluded from fulfilling this request." "No, Mr. Mildmay," said Captain Sealove, "you alone ought to do this duty, and I make a motion that Brother Mildmay, her pastor, be requested to preach sister Riverly's funeral sermon . that the body be brought into the church, and every respect be paid to the last wishes of our worthy sister." The vote was then taken, and as the opposition after their triumph, had thinned off, and Mr. Mildmay's personal presence had already began to work in his favor, it was voted that the funeral sermon be preached in the hlouse, and that Mr. Mildmay, their late pastor, should be requested to de- liver it.  ' Mr. Mildmay then said "'that he accepted the invitation, from a convic- tion that it was his duty to fulfil the request of oine dear to himl, to the church, and to Christ, and because he saw in it the workings of that mysterious Providence which overuled all our ways." 'He then closed the meeting by a fervent prayer ; then, with deep emotion, as out of his yearn- ing heart gave them his blessing. His friends now gathered around him with many expressions of sympathy. "Do not think," said Captain Sealove, wiping the tears from his brown, hardy cheek, " that we are going to let you off so easily. We have chosen you for our pilot, and if part of the crew; turn pirates, mutiny and hoist the black flag, we will take another vessel and make the port without them, none of your farewells, brother Mildmay, it males the salt water spring." I t"No indeed," said Deacon Stillworm, " there is the new lecture-hall I have built, all ready for you, and we will open it to-lnorrow." +    OR, OUR MUSIC AT DAWN.        ;  105 "But brethren," said Mr. Mildmay, " you know that I am not only a re- jected minister, but enjoy now the reputation of being an incendiary, in the literal sense of the word; are you willing to follow me through evil report?" "We are! we are!" said many voices. "Precious solls; " said Mr. Mildmay, " true and faithful brethren are ye indeed; but I do not like to put you to such a sacrifice." "No sacrifice," said Captain Sealove, "L we want to have you for our min- ister, and we shall esteem it the greatest privilege." "I accept your call, then," said Mr. Mildmay, " but I must insist on no salary the firs.9ear." "Brother, you 're always .begging off from having money; but you must let us do as we like; we don't want to stint ourselves in a blessillg, for as we give, so shall we receive," said the Captain. After they parted, and as they .were going home, Mrs. Sealove said to Miss Jenny, "Do you mean to go with us to the hall, to-morrow?" ' To be sure I do," answered Miss Jenny; " once I thought Mr. Mildmay nor anybody else could tempt me to leave my own seat, where 1 have sat ever since I was a child,-though thlat is not so very many years ago,-- I still think Mr. Mildmay has carried things to an extreme, but ever since they ve tried to prove him an incendiary, I do 't feel any fellowship; a:lld my old seat dbn't seem like lome. Besides, I can give a better guess than most people, as to who burnt that house. So, though I never went for novelties before, I shall go to the hall,.if it is a cross to me. I told the sex- ton, this morning, that if Mr. Mildmay left, I should let my pew; and lie told me he did n't believe me, for when he saw the old gallery pillars walk- ing off, then he should believe that I would leave them; but then you: enjoy new places, Mrs. Sealove." "If I like new places," answered Mrs. Scalove, '"I want to see my old friends in them," and with these words they parted. On the day of the ftleral, an immense crowd thronged the spacious church. The body of the departed believer was placed in the broad aisle. The blackness of the velvet pall was relieved by abundance of wlhite roses, fraglrant lilies, and evergreen, symbolizing the purity, sweetness and deathl- less hopes of the sleeping saint. Mr. Mildmay's appearance was calm evenll to grandeur. Sister Riverly was to serve the good cause i lher death, as well as in her life, and her fiuneral was to afford Mr. Mildmay a solemn op- portunity to leave behind him a perfect testimony against the giant sin with which he had struggled. H-Ie had shaken off all shackles, and his great mind worked freely. 'Lilke Samson, who at his death slew more than ill his life, so his last labor in that place as a minister, was most powerfll and did mighty execution. His pointed and impressive text was talien from the Widow of Nain,-- And he was the only so]n of his mother." He pic- tured the grief of a mother at the loss of an only son, though under the most alleviating circumstances, as the most severe of domestic afllictions; a grief so surpassing, that He who made the mother's heart, could not pass by this Widow of Nain. Her sorrow called forth the greatest of miracles. The Lord had compassion on the anguish of a mother's heart. it1  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7095-00000060"/> 106            THE REVEILLE: But we will not follow Mr. Mildmay through his sermon, because the story of William Riverly's fate is already before the reader; besides the ser- mon of a true preacher, loses half its power, without the living voice.- We will only say, that at its close, a deep thoughtfulness dwelt on every countenance, and a feeling of painful regret, in every heart, that they should there, hear Mr. Mildmay no more. *   *  i     * *      *   *   *    * Singleton was exceedingly elated, on the evening of the church meeting, at his triumph over Mr. Mildmay. He left immediately after the vote was taken, and went directly to the Rum conclave, then in sessi(n, and reported the success of the church Rum party. Haman, when he had built Mor- decai's gallows, could not have exulted more in his triumph. It put them all in excellent spirits. "Odt of the city with him, now," said Stronghead, " by any means and all means, or this very success will work against us; for, no doubt, Still- worm will let him his hall, and so the last error will be worse than the first." "Leave him with us," said Ready; "Singleton has got him out of the church,-for he, and not your big-bugs. has done the real drudgery; he has not spared for clinchers, I can tell you. Leave the getting him off tome, that's my part." But we will not detain the reader longer; a peep into Pandemonium, to hear the fiends exult over successful malice, is enough. Singleton's triumph was somewhat checked, the next day, when he heard that Mr. Miidmay was to preach again in that house, especially on an occa- sion in itself so great an illustration of the sin of rum-selling.-He was now too conscience-seared to feel the death of Mrs. Riverly. Another thing troubled him; Mordecai still sat in the king's gate. He heard that the following Sunday the new hall was opened, and that Mr. Mildmay preached all day and in the evening; and the people said, "'No bad man could preach as he did." The incendiary imputation could not stand be- fore him. It had helped to get him out of the church, but the people  would go after him. CHAPTER     XXVII. -:;    THE ROBBERY. Ready had lately enlarged his den, and added thereto a private gambling saloon. Singleton's purse supplied the means, and he was a secret partaker of the profits. Ready's profligacy and profusion always kept him low in  the purse. This place soon became a rendezvous for the most desperate  characters. i5   OB, OUR MUSIC AT DAWN.         107 A man of uncommon stature and forbidding appearance, came to Ready's saloon, and he and Ready soon became familiar. The next evening when he came, Ready went to Singleton. "We have got a fat pigeon to pluck," said he, " if we can but catch him. He is a six-footer, a ferocious one.-I guess his bowie-knife tastes blood sometimes, but he is all the better for that. He's a lucky gamester, and wins every game; but he loves good liquor, and if we could but get him drunk, fleece him, and then have him taken up for robbery, we should make a good venture; and we are safe, for this man is an utter stranger, and I think a pirate." "Rather too bad," said Singleton. "Rather too what?" roared Ready. "Too bad!" repeated Singleton. "None of your hypocrisy," said Ready, "nothing's too bad for you to do. The man has got a superb diamond ring on his finger,-wortlh a lot of money, I suppose. You may have that, besides half of the rest of the booty, if you will only go right through with it like a man." "Why, what can 1 do?" asked Singleton. "You see," answered Ready, " he is a good judge of liquors. I hlave gt nothing but the common sort, good enough to get drunk with, but he d won't touch my stuff; he wants your real old Cogniac brandy, and Scotch whiskey, and your best of Hollands, and your rich old wine. You have got all these in your cellar. You get up a supper first-rate, and I will in- vite him up here, and'we will go through the play. He seems to take to I me, and we can fleece him, depend on it. Dou't look so qualmish; it will be all fun to carry this game through." i "Bring him up," said Singleton, "I will be prepared for him." I  Sigleton, after Ready left, went to rouse his wife ; who, having been kept up several nights by successive parties, was asleep in her chair. He shook her roughly; she awoke, and he drove her about till everything was ready. She could not refrain from grumbling a little, being completely worn out. None of your muttering, " said he, "or I will lay the cow- skil across your shoulders." a  Singleton, since he had been so rapidly descending into the depths of Sa- tan, had considerably sharpened his tyranny over his wife. His intercourse with Ready, had made him coarser, and more brutal in his discipline. He was carrying the steam too high, on his weaker vessel ; the pressure of his tyranny was too great; but he was not fearful of an explosion; he calcu- lated largely on her natural stolidity and patience. Singleton felt a little afraid, when he saw what a giant of a man they were to bring down, but he knew the power of liquor, he haq seen it before, lay low the towering strength of a powerful man. He hid a natural skill in reading countenan- ces, but he did not need that faculty, to see that the person before him was no common desperado, for a horrid darkness was on his face. "Ready tells me,"said the guest, "that you are the only man in the city who understands getting up a good supper, and that you keep choice liq- nors in your cellar; you have now before you a judge of eating and drink- ing, I can tell you. Ready also tells me that you keep a lodging as well as a victualing house.", I  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7095-00000061"/> (108           THE REVEILLE: "Yes sir," replied Singleton, "I accommodate a few lodgers." T (1'hen I 'll stay to-night, and you may serve up supper." This was done in tempting style, and after the mrdhhad eaten and drunk, and begun to feel the wine a little, he said to Singleton,- (Show me my room, and send me up a bottle of this capital brandy, another of the gin, a couple of bottles of wine, and a plate of sandwiches." Off he went, and the required entertainment followed him. He received it, and then locked his door. Singleton had beeni out about eight in the evelling, and hired the crier to cry a pocket-book, which he said he had lost, containing a hundred dollars. Then he lodged a complaint at the police- office, describing the pocket-book and its contents, that it might be known if brought in. About midnight the confederates. entered the man's room by a ftlse key. They found him drunk, and began to search his petson. IL I his pockets they found nothing but a pocket-book, containing a few hills, but in various parts of his dress, they found gold secreted to aj arge amount. Singleton then put his hand to the diamond ring on his little linger, but as lie touched it; the man, drunken as he was, gave a deep groan, and made a c:onvulsive effort to hide the ring with the other hand. At the groan and convulsive etffort of the man, Singleton shrunk back. "(Get it off, you fool!" exclaimed Ready, ." what are you boggling with him for!" The ring was so tight, it was difficult to remove it. The man groaned again. I cannot get it off," said Singleton. "If you won't," said Ready, " curse me if I don't, and then the ring is mine. I've been into deeper work than this, this very night, and I sha'n't stop for a groan." What work?" asked Singleton. "Work that you want done, but have not got   pluck enough to  do it yourself," answered Ready. "Come, don't stand there bothering ; - don't be a fool." Singleton now gave another and a more determined pull, and off came the ring, which Singleton, for the time, secreted. They then divided their spoil. and placed the pocket-book they had pretended was stolen, in a secret pocket in the man's dress; left the room and locked the man in. Ready took a lodging there for the night. In the ,norning, Singleton rose early to carry out his plan. But upon going out, he found the whole city in a state of excitement. There had been, a daring attempt to blow up the house in which Mr. Mildmay now lived, and it was partially successful. The family had returned from the country directly after thie decision of the church meeting. The explosion  took place directly under Mr. Mildinay's study, where Singleton had called on ohim, two days before, to get some church books in his possession. Mr. Mildmay was always in the habit of passing his evenings in the study, either with the elder members of his family, or alone. The evening when j thile gunpowder plot came off, he retired alone to his study, where he en- gaged for a time in secret prayer,for there his great strength lay ; but after J it'lled for a time inr   '/       C1o, OUtH lMUSiit AT PAWN.         10 that. recollecting that he had left a book he was reading, in the ilarlor, lie returned there to get the volume. While lie went, the explesion took place. If he had not left the room it would have been his instant death, as it blew to atoms the very chair at whcll he had been kneeling a nmoiient before. The wholC house was shaken as by an eartliquake, and the cor- ncr where the study was situated, was torn all to pieces. A scene of con- fu1sion ensued, for there was no certainty that the mnischief was over. T'e whole fa tuily of Mr. Mildmay rushed out at the noise. A crowd gathered at once. It was quite a dark evening. "Let u's go to Captain Sealove's," said Mr. Mildmay. A carriage was soon offered, and they drove off to Mrs. Sealove's. This was, on the very face of it, a daring atteml;t to kill Mr. Mihhlnay. Singleton though he well knew something would be done, lie knew not tile t tihe when this diabolical exploit would come off. Singleton was willing to plot any villainy, but he wanted always to use some cats-paw to perfiorm it. He was one of these mean cowards of crime, originating villainy, but pussilanimously causing others to carry it into effect. The excitement of the night, made him entirely forget Ready's hint, and when lie went out the news of the morning took him by surprise. He, unluckily for himself, stumbled on a man of his acquaintance, who was full of the late event, aid insisted on Singleton's going with him to the scene of the explosion, although Singleton'told him he had been robbed the day before, and was going to the police office. But the man urged that it was but a short distance, and to avoid suspicion, he went, although lie felt all the way, as if he was going to the gallows. As they went, his unsuspectiug companion told him all the particulars of the disaster, by which Singleton learned that not so much as the smell of the fire had passed upon the garments of Mr. Mildmay, or his family. They soon came. in sight of the blackened and broken house. Singleton was now insensible to remorse, yet this sight deepened the heavy blackness hanging over his soul. Vexed at being de- tained so long, he now parted with his acquaintance, and hastened to the police office. Hlere, also, was he delayed for some time, and it was nearly noon when he returned to his house with two officers, with a scarclh war- rant. He had stated some plausible reason, for suspecting that one of his lodgers had possession of the lost pocket book. The state of mind in which this miserable wretch walked back to his house, is not to be describ- ed, cowardice and villainy were mingled in him to such a pailiful degree. On entering the house, he was surprised not to see Ready there waiting for hini. He would have gone to the kitchen, to enquire of his wife, but the officers being in'haste, hurried him to the room of the stranger ; but behold, the door was open and the late occupant had fled. The officers after cracking their jokes on Singleton, left the house. "After all," thought Singleton, "I am glad he has gone, for he will be afraid tp come back for his money. I will go now, and find out where Ready/is, from my wife." When he came to the kitchen he found it empty, but not swept and gar- nished, for everything was in confuSion. He took down the cow-skin and  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7095-00000062"/> "O           THE REVEILLE: went to see if his household slave had presumed to take a nap. But no, she was not there. A glimpse of the truth n)w flashed across his mind and he went to the desk where he kept his money. In his first secret draw- er he had deposited the diamond ring, which hle found safe. In his joy in finding it, he immediately slipped the coveted jewel scintillating light, on his finger, determined not to risk loosing it again. But his next secret drawer he found robbed of its contents; the principal sum being the booty of last night. Now, who was the robber, the stranger, or Ready? If it was the stranger, he had missed the drawer with the ring; and where was Nabby? But he was not long left to conjectures. On closing the desk, a note dropped from the top of it. It was in his wife's bad spelling, and al- most illegible hand, but probably partly dictated by another. It read thus: "You have knocked me round and snubbed me long enough ; and now I have found somebody that I like better, who will treat me like a lady. I shall take money with me; I have earnt it. You have drove me to this. "Tread on a worm, and it will turn." Mr. Ready sends his best respects, and hopes the next likely wife you get, you will know how to treat her.-- This from your wife that was." Nothing could exceed Singleton's mortification and rage. He had boast-  ed far and near, that he alone knew how to rule a woman; and always cited his Nabby, as the proof of his skill in training a wife, and bringing her under the yoke, and now to be outwitted, and cheated, and robbed by  this same Nabby, it was too excruciating, it cut him to the quick. But Ready, his confederate, to be the Pars of this Helen! Every circumstance  embittered his cup. But we must say, the loss of the good solid gold, did in Singleton's mind exceed the loss of wife, and comrade. Revenge was I left him, and the possible recovery of the adored gold. He dismissed his ledgers, shut uphis house, took an officer and pursued the fugitives. Dis- covering that they had gone to New York, he followed them there. There they were found, and arrested on the night of Singleton's arrival. Ready vowed revenge, but Singleton, under the shadow of the law, and stimulated  by revenge, so as to lose his native cowardice, defied him. Besides, Single- ton was in possession of too many facts that might lengthen Ready's im- prisonment, though they must be cautiously used. Dear reader, at this critical juncture, I must suppose thee consigned over to a sort of Rip Van Winkle sleep, lasting six years, at the termination of which I commence my next chapter.                r A              .

The man- sion of a certain wealthy money broker, we see standing in one of the principal streets of a city, of which in our. waking up from a six years' sleep, w have some confused remembrance. The very respectable gen- tleman who owns that fine mansion, did not enjoy a very enviable reputa- tion some years since. Certain dirty foot prints he had left behind him, when he was first pushing his way up the mount of Mammon; but his fellow-citizens seem to agree charitably to forget, in admiration of his rap- idly increasing wealth, his early reputation. Two years before this time, he had taken a wife from a distant place.-a wealthy widow,-who under- stood matrimonial tactics so well, that she ruled her husband with whole- some sway, and retained, contrary to his calculations, her own property in her own hands. Although haughty, gloomy and austere to others; to her he was ever obsequious and submissive. I He was subject to turns of deep gloom and despondency. One individ- i ual who had been connected with one scene in his past history, had left a strong impression on his mind. A strange and terrific suggestion, that this mysterious personage might be the Evil one himself, haunted a mind nat- urally superstitious, and rendered more so by guilt. The remarkably re- pulsive appearance of that individual,-his being entirely unknown,-his riches,-his mysterious departure, leaving no traces behind; his never be- ' ing heard of afterward, tended to confirm the fearful suspicion we have mentioned. Our gentleman was confined to the house by indisposition, at the time our story commences, but not so seriously so as to prevent his dashing wife from attending a fashionable party. It was a bitter, bitter night in the last of February, and the snowy canopy over every house, was fringed deep with icicles. Here and there, large trees glittered in the clear moonlight, like immense chandeliers, or rather like trees of diamonds, so completely studded were' they with the "beauteous work of frost." The door bell rang violently. A servant entered the parlor, and told the gentleman that there was a poor woman at the door, asking charity. "Shut the beggar out at once," said he; "how dared she ring at the front door." The man muttered as he went down to the door, "If the mistress were in, sure it wouldn't be this way." Again the servant returned, "And sure, your hon- or," said the servant, "she has come into the hall, and it is hard getting the likes of her out." "Get James instantly," said the gentleman, "and let him help you put her out."

He heard tlhe voice of the woman in altercation with the men, and grew deadly pale as he heard it, for he lrknew that voice. He perceived that the woman was stirtmulated somewhat by liluor ; that she hadl newly arrived in the, city, antd was not aware whose house she was in. "( I am dying," said she, " with cold and hunger. For God's sake, let me lie down anywhere, and give me a mouthfful to eat." But the servants carried out their master's mandate, for they knew they must, or lose their places. One of them gave her a few cents. ; There," said he, " spend that in a little rum; the way ye will warm your old bones:" The next day the gentleman was going to his office, and he was called to sit as juror, oni the body of a woman found dead in an old shied. He shuddered as he drew near and got a sight of the face of the corpse; for. though bruised and disfigured, he knew that face, but lie saw that no one there recollected it. Imprisonment arnd subsequent vice of the lowest kind had made haggish and haggard the countenance that once had some rude pretensions to beauty. It was the woman who had beenl turned from his house, by his order. the previous evening. It was his former wife. He had caused her death!! Just one week ficom that time. the gentleman, thlrough pressure of busi- ness, had occasion to stay till about midnighlt at his office. He was so deeply engaged, that he did not, for a moment perceive that a tall, dark looking man, muffled up in a cloak, had entered the room. He started, to see, at that late hour, this muffled figure; but when the maln 'threw back Iris cloak, and presented his dark countenance to view, the money broker recoiled with horror, for it was the very individual, whose terrific aspect hlad halllted him so many years. There was a glare of fiery light from his eyes, as he came forward, and fixing his gaze on the dazzling diamond ring worn on the finger of the gentleman, enquired in a stern voice, and seizing the hand as he spoke, " where did you get this ring?"l Singleton, (for our rich nabob is no other than he,) made an effort to speak, but his voice clloked off almost to spasms. "Try if you can get it off," said the stranger. Luxtlrious plenty had given flesh to Singletol's once spare bones, and the ring adhered so closely it seemed almost imbed- ded in the flesh. "Ha, ha!" said the stranger, with a fiendish sneer, "i gripe it as you did twhen you thought you had me dead drunk, and yerk- ed it from my finger. There is a spell in that ring, and you sold your soul when you put it on; ha, ha!" and the jeering, diabolical laugh, again sent torture through the soul of the terrified Singleton. His visitor then drew fromn beneath his cloak, a piece of ancient yellow parchment, and a bowie knife. The sweat stood on the forehead of Sin- gleton ; his features wore a dying paleness, and his eyes wandered wildly round the room, to see if there were any meanls of escape, but there was none, if he had attempted to fly, for the stranger had locked the door. "Put your name on this parchment," said the stranger. W^   OR, OUR MUSIC AT DAWN.          113 "Let me read it first," said Singleton. "It is written in characters you do not understand," replied the sratnger, " but sign it, and thou slialt have 4  gold enough." i "But if I do not? said Singleton, (now con vulsed with fear) "what q  then?5" "Then I will get my revenge and my ring. I will cut out the false tongue that would have lied a stranger into prison; and then I will cut off the pampered finger that wears my diamond ring." "4Who are you?" said Singleton, "in Heaven's name P" "Heaven is not for thee to namen; thou wilt know me before we part." Singleton now felt sure that the tempter was before ]him. His teeth E chattered, his flesh quivered. Julst heaven, thought lie, to what have my -; crimes brolght me. I have served Satan, but dreadful sight, I now see my ? infernal master. T'he stranger sterinly held forth the parchment. "T cannot sign it," said Singleton. "Thrust out thy lying tongue!" said his foe, while determination flashed ; through the lurid light of his eyes. Singleton was no more in his hands than a babe. He seized his head and threw it back. O "Oh, spare me! spare le!" said Singleton.       ! "To whom have you ever shown mercy?" said the man, as he drew ! forth a small keen bladed kn ife. -!  "Ohi11O! I will sign the parchment," said Singleton. : - ." But I must have the ring also," said the stranger, and suiting the action t? to the word, he drew the rillng fromn the finger with rlthless force. The -:' blood came with it. "A,1!" said the stranlger, "that isdainty blood oftlhine, :; fed to richness with the wrongs of widows and orphans, thou must sign thy i' name with some of that luscious lblood."! So saying, lie drew out a golden pen, acnd dipped it in the flowing blood. "  Singleton was now so nearly dellad with terror, that the stranger had to 3 hold his hanlld while hle traced hlls lame on the parchlment. He then placed the ring, on his own finger, tnd takillng a goblet fromn the marble table he dashed water on the face of Singletonl, which revived him. hle stranger 1ow threw back the door, and standing on the threshold, at!lis fill height, : imperious and formidable. "I told thee," said lhe, 1"I wuld tell thee my :4 name; I am Satan!" and as he spokc, he closed the door with sich vio- lence that the lamp went out, and S ingleton was left alone in utter darkness. : At this awfull parting he fainted. His lady returtning from a plarty, and find- i ing that he was not yet t at home, despatched a servant to see what was the i- matter, who found him in a swoon ; his ring gone, and his finger wounded. e Singleton was very ill .the next day, but on recovering lie told his family j that a robber had come in suddenly upon him and stolen his rilyg. 4I But the work was done for him. Despair and darkness drove in upon i' his soul. The yellow scroll, the name written in blood, and the withering words, "I am Satan!"7 haunted him day alnd night. Tl'he dreadful belief that he was beyond mercy, settled down on his guilty heart. He returned ! to business as a relief. Unusual success attended his busihess movelents, i and this deepened his hidden anguish, because it confirmed the words of the dreadful stranger, "that he should now have all the gold he coveted." 36tts                      '   "  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7095-00000064"/> "4     ]C   A  TE R  XXlILL CHAPTER XXIX. WOODLAND COTTAGE. In the neighborhood, but not too near thg skirts of a far-spreading wood, and hence called Woodland Cottage, stood a dwelling, screened from the sun in summer by the fragrant vines of the honeysuckle, and the climbing multiflora, which seemed to love to embrace and grace that peaceful home. In the winter it was made cheerfth by clumps of dark evergreens. This was now the residence of our friends, the Mildmay's. It was near a rail- road, and at a convenient distance firm the city. Mr. Mildmay removed from the city, for he said if he were ever judged worthy to be blown up againt, he did not wish to have any neighbors to endanger. Mrs. Mildmay's family came from Scotland, and she had visited her sister there, a year pre- vious to this time. She was accompan;ed by Helen, who remained behind, at her aunt's request whenl lher mother returned. This her parents agreed to, as her application to her studies, and her duties at home, was too unspt r- ing, and her aunt Graham had a quiet and healthful home, and tenderly loved her. Helen had there congenial society, and full relaxation from care, whereas, at home she had been disposed to overtax a fine constitution. The clouds under which Mr. Mildmay's reputation was, when we left him some years ago, were sreedily dispersed. After Ready's suspicions flight from the city, so immediately subsequent to the guntpowder affair, the pub- lic very generally came to the very obvious conclusion that it was Ready who bturned the Bligland larsonage, unaware that Mr. Mildmay had removed; especially as it took place at a time when he was known to be in the city. In cominig to tils conclusion, the public were much assisted by our wor- thy friend, Mr. Patrick Shanlnon, who, while cautiously avoiding getting in- to hot water with Singleton, did not fail to give hints of true Hibernian breadth of insinuation, that it was Ready did that wicked and reckless deed. But although public opinion was changed, it was too late to remedy the work which the flagitous falsehoods effected-the dismissal of Mr. Mild- mav from his church. The church was still in possession of the rum party, and of course in a declining state, as to spiritual influence. Several pastors had been tried and dismissed by the ruling Tarty, because they were not sound on their great sine qua n,n, the NOT loving our neighbors as ourselves, being severally sus- pected of leaning most heretically to some of the ramifications branching out fromn that impracticable and obsolete commandment, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself:" But they had lately gladdened their souls by the felicitious selection of a certain Mr Trimmer, under whose shadow they sat down with great delight, for it was so conveniently umbrageous that all th1. fowls of the air, clean and unclean, might ledge in the branches of it. He trimmed off the royal robe of the gospel closer than ever David did Saul's garments   O R, OUR MuSIC AT DAWN.         1" *    *   *   *    *   *   *    *   * It was noon, the last of March, and Miss Jenny, that evergreen, as fresh as we left her six years ago, was passing the afternoon with Mrs. Sealove. The Captain had promised them a drive after tea, to the charming parson- age of which we have spoken. "Ah, Miss Jenny," said Mrs. Sealove, "You were not at our meeting last night. Mr. Morely, Mrs. Grafton, and Deacon Stillworm's two daughters have come forward for baptism. Deacon Stillwell, I should say, for at Mr. Mldmay's suggestion, tie has had his name legally changed. He told him tlat in old times, they took new names after conversion, and Stillwell was was a good name for a progressive Christian." "I am sorry I was not there," said Miss Jenny, "for I like my neighbor Mrs. Grafton, very much. Did you know Mr. Morely had presented her the house she lives in? I was there when the deed was signed." "These single gentlemen and ladies, Miss Jenny, do the world much good after all," said the Captain. After a cheerflll meal, the carryall was quickly made ready and they drove out to the cottage. When the party arrived, they found all the family very much animated by the reception of a letter from their beloved Helen, and Mrs. Sealove begged, if it was suitable, that she and Miss Jenny miglt hear it, and share  their pleasure. It was a pleasant, afectionate, domestic letter. All unaf: fected, natural home letters are similar, for the heart always speaks the one language. But there was a passage at the last of the letter, wlich was ;ar- ticularly noticed by the two visitors. It read thus:--"Auntt has just come into my room, and tells me there is to be a lecture on Chlristial Char- ity or the new call of the Church, this evening, by a gentleman, who in consequence of the loss of a beloved friend, became truly a converted per- son. She says, the lady who came to invite us, tells her lie is full of the : real unction of the ministry.  I anticipate .a great deal, and if I write again before I embarkl for my dear home, I will give you a sketch of [ the lecture." t  The ladies, when this was read, though they looked at one another sig- ; nificantly, deferred comment till they were snugly seated on the back seat : of the Captain's carryall, when Miss Jenny could no longer contain herself. "There," said she, "Helen Mildmay will liave that lecturer. I always [ said it would be so; she slighted Edward Grey, and refused Charles Big- land, and other nice chances, and now she will marry someDody that's just j got nothing in his pocket, but his lecture notes. That is one fatlt in Mr.  Mildmay, and you must allow it, Mrs. Sealove; he has brought ulp his 1 children to think too little of money, which none of us cal do without and for my part, I wish I had a good plenty of it." "Ah;" said the Captain, "Brother Mildmay don't want too heavy a car- I go onboard. He's bearing away too strong for the Kingdom." "I was in hopes," said Mrs. Sealove, "that somehow or other, Helen would fall in with Edward Grey, the other side of the water." "No hope of his having her," said 1iss Jenny. "Cora Moore says he     .  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7095-00000065"/> 16            THE REVEILLZ: is one of the most promising youths in England, and is engaged to a beau- tiful heiress." "t Why, Miss Jenny," said the captain,-" how you women build ulp cas- tles in the air! The girl merely mentioned she was going to hear some- body lecture, and you have got her woo'ed and wedded." 'I cannot help it," said Miss Jenny, " it seemed to me just as natural as life, when they read that letter, that he would see her, fall ill love with her, and she with him." "The captain may laugh at us as muchll as lie pleases," said Mrs. Sea- love, "I think just as you do. When they were reading that part of the letter, something said to me, that preacher will be Helen Mildmay's hus- batnd. I have great faittk in presetltiments." "Have it so if you will," said tihe captain; " she is a glorious girl, and a good one, and the man that has her, will get something as near to an angel as you can hold in this dark old world, that has been o0n this long six thou- sand vears' cruise, and is now ready to split with its own rottennless. Come, give tus the hymn, ' Lo what a glorious sight appears.' Silling, in an eve- ning ride, is pleasant." The good ladies soon forgot their gossip in a wis- er employtnent. CHAPTER     XXX,. PATRICK SHANNON. The morning after this visit to Woodland Cottage, Patrick Shannon call- ea on Jenny to get slips of sonme choice plants, for Mrs. Grafton, who was now interested in adorning a hlouse, now munificently made her own. As 'usual, he fell into a chat. "Have ye heard," said he, " how poorly Misther Singleton is getting?" "I heard something a while ago," said Miss Jenny, "about his being rob- bed and frightenced, so that lihe fell sick, but the story was all hushed up, and I have learned nothing more." ,' Then let me tell you, lie's clane gone in a galloping consumption.

And with this, blessing, Patrick went i  on his way. i   'The Rum Clhth, ill these six years, had somewhat varied in its member- ship, but never i. its position.  Tile new niembers were base cnougli, but not marked men.  None of them had the crafty sagacity of Singleton, the fox, nor the prowling ferocity of Ready, the tiger. Singleton, once the jackall of the club, ever sticking closely to the caterpillar maxim, that we must creep before we can fly; after creeping and crawling, and twisting and i turning, through all the first stages of Mammon's progress, now far o'er topped them all. But Strolghead, Rockheart and Wood, still stood their - ground, on their old rum platform. There was really a dead time in the temperance cause.  Men, once ac- tive, seemned to settle down into listlessness. Old habits, that hlad either been driven down to the dregs of society, or risen to swim in its upper froth, began again to circulate through the vital, central part. What was most to be lamented, some of the reformed inebriates grew secure and care- less. It is just so in religion; revivals pass away, but spiritual, like politi- cal liberty, is hleld only at the price of unceasi-ng vigilance, and lie, who is UNia3 y, in it Bmt sgai^lBs      ijgAs 32 f ie wa W  I sXy z sn ya^e tls Ly utlto ia "W atch?.? Even Jerry Woodliffe no longer felt himself in danger; and his wife, af- ter a test of so many years, confided fully in the stability of her husband. Eight reformed inebriates, during the lapse of six years, had fallen victims to the wiles of these rum-sellers, and were each now lying in drunkards' graves. . *Vide Hawkins.  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7095-00000066"/> TIEM RETVlLLE : The three worthies were together one day, in Stronghead's counting room, talking over the times, especially delighting themselves in a late as- sertion from Trimmer's pulpit, that there was a "reaction." "I have seen it for some time ;" said Wood, why, would you believe it? Jerry Woodliffe took a glass of soda in my shop the other day." "Jerry Woodliffe!" said Stronghead, " how in the world did you ever get him there? lie has shunned us all, as if we had been so many rattle- snakes." "You know," said Wood, "Jerry and I are the same side in party, and I had a chance to get him a little birth he wanted. I did it, and that set me up in his favor. After we became acquainted, Jerry undertook to give me some advice about selling liquor, but I soon stopped him; and ever since we have been very sociable about party matters. I rather think he never let his wife know that he had formed a new acquaintance. Not never, till a few days ago, did I give friend Jerry, the initiating degree of a glass of soda." "Now Wood," said Stronghead, "if you are as knowing as I think you are, you will secure him for an every day customer ill the run of a month. I should like to fix that Jerry, because he is the most noted of the reform- ed men; because he is one of Mildmay's right hand men, and because his wife, Mary Woodliffe, gives me a look with her saucy eyes, whenever she meets me, as much as to say, we're a match for you." "I make no brags," said Wood, coolly. "By the way, Singleton is failing fast." "That's a singular affair," said Stronghead, "about that diamond ring he was robbed of. I have observed him wearing that ring, ever since Ready and his wife run off, with the lodger on whom he was about to serve a war- rant. There was some hocus pocus about that affair. I have asked him about it, but he shyed off." "There's one curious fact ;" said Rockheart, "about the last of February a woman, thinly clad, came into my store one night, and bought a glass of liquor, and went out. After she was gone, I recollected her looks, and could swear it was his wife. That night a woman died in the street, and I think it was her." After other conversation, but such as is irrelevant to this story, the con- federates seperated. Mr. Mildmay was sitting with his family at breakfast one morning, when a note was brought for hi'n by the New York express. He read it, and it was as follows: "Mr. Mildmay, I amlying in prison, very sick of the jail fever. I want to see you to confess to you some of my crimes; please hasten, or I shall be no more."                    JIM READY. Mr. Mildmay always in haste to obey the call of distress, left that morn- ing, for the great city. When he arrived, he immediately repaired to the prison. Ready and another prisoner who was sick of the same disease had been removed to a cell at a little distance from the others. Mr. Mildmay's   OR, OUH a1SIC AT DAWN.         119 sympathy was deeply moved when he entered the cell. In that dull and sombre light, he saw two beds at the end of the cell, On one bed lay in all the discomfort of prison sickness, the once lithe and firmly knit form of Ready, all unnerved and trembling. A dark curtain partly sladed the oth- er rude bed. As Mr. Mildmay drew near the bed, Ready looked up and recognized him. At first he hid his face and groaned. At length he said, "Mr. Mildmnay, I have been a hardened wretch. I know there is no mercy for me; I don't ask any. I cannot, but I must try while breath is spared me, to tell you some things." He then, with much effort, and at intervals of some moments, told his story, which was in substance, as follows: "I was a rude, wild, thoughtless young man, but I never got desperately , wicked till I began to keep a rum-shop: this drew a bad gang around me, and I soon did not care what I did. I drank a little myself, just enough to keep me strung up. I was strong, and loved fighting, and I got to be a boxer. I got so that I gloried in doing all the wickedness I could, but I was quick-witted and smart, and I got in with a club of rumsellers, who thought themselves pretty much. Singleton was one of them, and the old fox learnt me more wicked tricks than ever I knew before. He and I drove one team a long while, trying to get tie reformed temperance men back to drinking again. I liked the fll, and played it up well, and stopped at nothing, but the worse the deed, thl better for me. I had a good appe- tite to rob, or murder, or anything. You, sir, was one we were bound to break down, and to drive you out of the church, and even out of the city. I got worked up to hate you like --, and one time I could have cut your throat as easy as a butcher does a lamb's. "And wlhat was your cause of hatred?" asked Mr. Mildmay. "Only because you preached down rum. It was me helped get Gren- y ville mad drunk, though Singleton began the plot. And now let me tell you quick, for I feel my voice fail;-it was I who burnt the Bigland house. Singleton came and told n;e one day, some weeks after you went into the country, thathe had just seen you in the street, and he thought you had come to stay over Sunday. That night I fired the house, and in- tended to have burnt you up in it. It's all true, sir; no use in lying now, and these things are down upon me like a storm of hell-fire and brimstone, and I'll tell you all,-it may ease me some. God knows I found I had made a mistake; you was n't there ; but it was a lucky mistake, I thought then, for the burning of it was laid to you. Singleton, the old boss of Satan, laid it to you everywhere. After you got put down in the church, the rum-club said, "Drive him out of the City!" and I said, I am up to it. So I fixed the gun-powder under your dwelling, intending to blow you up, but something took care of you. Two or three days before, a stranger came to my gambling saloon, and the very night I fixed the gun-powder for you, I got himn up to Singleton's  Here the prisoner at the other end of the cell uttered an exclamation.- Ready paused, but all was silent. "The poor wretch is in great pain," said Ready.

I had read some stories about robbers' lives, and I wanted to be a highwayman. Another thing, I liked Singleton's wife right well, and there was no way to have her but to run off with her. So I told her that night to prepare. Next morn- ing, while Singleton was gone with a warrant, to apprehend the man he bad robbed, on a false charge, we, opened his desk, helped oulrselves, and when we got all ready to go, I unlocked the man's door with a false key. There he lay, still kitnd of stupified and dozing.-"Fly for your life!" - said I, "the officers of justice are after you!" #He cleared quicker than we did. I met him some months afterwards, and told him all the particu- lars; only I laid the robbery on Singleton. I suppose youl know that Singleton arrested us, here in New York, and threw us into prison. After we. came out, I stayed here awhile,--then I was off to Eng!an-d, but I left Singleton's wife behind. There I lived a highway robber for several years and then I returned here. I killed a man in a quarrel, and now I amn sen- tenced to be hung, but I shall die here, on this bed, before the suni goes down."       "Where is Siingleton's wife?" asked Mr. Mildmay, "Gone to perdition, I suppose," answered Ready. "These three things of all my wickedness, trouble me most; leaving that woman when sme was sick, to starve to death,- trying to miurder you,- and entrapping Will Riverly, whose mother was so good to my old father when he was dying. There's the three things, but it is all blood, blood, blood, on my sonl! 1 Mr. Mildmay now kneeled down and prayed. He prayed fervently, for he felt that the case was desperate.. After he had risen from prayer, Ready held out his hand to him. "You are a good man, to pray so for me, after all I have told you. Can you forgive me?" "Yes indeed," said Mr. Mildmay, L' and no great stretch of goodness, in your case, either, to forgive and pity you, as I do, from the bottom of my soul. Let me read you a little in the bible." "No!" said he, "I am weak, and besides, I don't understand the bible, and I don't know as it is true." Why, you believe in a God, don't you?" "Yes, for he is paying me for my sins; and I believe in Hell, for I feel it." And he repeated it again, almost shrieking, "I feel it." "You believe that I have forgiven you, don't you?" "I know you have, by your coming right on here to see me, and by that prayer. Since my mother died-I never flinched befor;e, but that prayer brought out my hand to you; and by ---, if I thinklI of it any more I shall cry, and I swear I will die like a man. Go, you have heard all now, let me-die like a man." ';But if 1, a frail man can forgive you, how much more, God, who is in- finitely merciful." "No! no! He wont forgive me; men say, the gallows for him; and God says Hell! and there is no forgiveness in the gallows, nor in hell.-- Leave me now, good friend; you cannot persuade me; let me die game."   OR, OUR MUSIC AT DAWN.          12 21 "Do not go yet!" said a feeble, husky voice from the other part of the cell. "Oh!" said PReady, "go to him, he is dying; they brourht him in here sick last night; I've not seen him yet; he is belhindl trat curtainl. I've hKeard his voice three or four times. I've heard it before, somellwhere, but I can. not tell where, my head is all confision. Go to him, if fle waets you, lie may be saved, but not me. There is no mercy for lue here, or hereafter.' "There is mercy here," said Mr. Mildmay, layig i ad on his Imheart "and tender mery with God. This bible tells you1, that Juesus prayed for his murderers." ,                     . ' Jesus pray for murderers?" said Ready, "are you sure?" "Yes, cannot you believe it, who have heard me, through his spirit pray Leave me ;" said Ready, more gently, " go to the man. Jesuis Chri t pray for murderers? he repeated. Mr. Mildmay judged it best to leave him. He saw that there was a dropof blood, jlst abolllt to drop finom the cross on that guilty heart, aJnd he left it to make its own way! G(;oig behind the cur- tain, he saw what had been a tall and stalwart foilrm, atnd a face hideoullsly dark and Satanic, but powerffll, Death was about to comnimernce his fearfull struggle with this other victim, and his countenance was really appalling. "I too," said he, in a low tone of voice, " ave my glilt to onifess. 'I know that man whom   you have just tallred with; I do not wish him to hear me.   Death is deafeniog him; draw nearer, and he cannot hear.- I was the son of wealthy parelnts," contitled he, "but my tather died; my mother married again, and my step-father hated me. I ran away, went to sea, and became wild and reclkless; alid at last, b ing of a high temper and brave, I led a mutiny on board of a vessel. We killed the captain. and tired pirates, and grew to be so bad, that I revelled in murder. I thillrnk Satan entered into me, as into Judas Iscariot, alnd sometimes I felt an awfitl identity with Ihim. I was the terror of the seas.

If you will never disclose it, I will tell you." i "I Call make no promiscs ;" said Mr. Mildmay, ' but 01O! if you colld repent!        ', The manl turned his face sulllenly to the wall, and Mr. Mildmay's earnest entreaties had no effect upon him. Mr. Mildmay gave up in despair, and returled to Ready. Without asking permission, he now slowly read part li  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7095-00000068"/> 122            THE REVEILLE : of the account of the death of Christ. When he ceased, he looked, and the tears! -yes, the first gracious tears he had ever wept, were rolling down the felon's ghastly face! He was dying, and dying very hard; blt in his intervals of pain, no doubt he looked earnestly up to the Pardoner; for just before he breathed his last, le turned over, and, looking up into Mr, Mildmay's face, with peace in his eyes, he whispered,- -" there is mercy even for me." After he expired, MNr. Mildmay returned to the death bed of the pirate, but he too was gonle,--gone without any sign of repentance. The minister thought of the two thieves, and of their different fates. The jailor, found on the person of the pirate, a letter to his first officer, which he had forgotten to destroy, and gave it inl charge to Mr. Mildmay, together with the diamond ring. It appeared that he had been too bold in. returning into the city ; for a man who had once teen his prisoner, and had escaped fi-or him, recognized hiln, though disguised, and had him arrested. The letter referred to, explainied the mysterious revenge: it was as follows. "You know, Jack, with what Ipurpose I returned to New-Englland, lately. I lulrked about till I found the rascal, Singleton; he had become a nabob.-I immediately executed my revenge. Thie lnave is reached with an invisi- ble sword. I performed my plart well. I ifelt I was the Fiend, indeed.- He believes thiat lie las siLgned, with ilis own blood, the scroll of thh con- demrmed souls, who have sold themselves to the Evil Oie.

The gold in his coffers is turned into hot coals of Ferdition, for he believes himself lost! * * * * " Mr. Mildmay lllnnediatcly returned home, in haste to unravel this mys. tory to Singleton. It was now nearly three months he had been wasting away under his terriffic punishnlet. He wenlt directly to the mansion of Singleton, and asked to see Mrs. Singleton. The servant at first told him that Mr. Singleton was very low, and he could not see her; but he finally obtailled an initerview. He told her thlat he liad news fvr her husband of the greatest importance. atnd he could tell it only to him. He was now admitted to the sick man's roorm. If the chamber where the good man nmeets llis fate, is quite on the verge of lieavetn, so is the deathl-bed of the sililner on the verge of the yawniing blacKlLcss of darkness, a darkness to be felt. But, though the scenes at the prison had been almost too dreadiild for Alr. Mikllulay to sustain, the sight. he now beheld, trans- cended them. T'he rich drapery of the couch, the costly arrallgements of the room, made a more paiflth contr'ast to the real state of the sufferer, than t the pkicd walls of' the rlisol; showing how irmpotent' is the rich man's wealth, in the day of Gcd's visitation. There, lay Singleton, a te', ror not to be uttered on his face; the dying features of the pirate, had been dreadful, but here was already, all tlhat fe:ar ia s ever pictured of the hope- lqss interminable wre. Oftel, lie could not be lheld in bed. lis selfaccu- lations for his past life, were agonizing. All lis sins seemed set in order before him. eic was lying quietly when Mr. Mildmay entered, having ex- hausted himself in wildly lamenting his folly ald his fate.   OR, OUR. MUSIC AT DAWN.          123 Mr. Mildmay approached the bed, and after a few enquiries, as if nothing particular was connected with it, said to him, "I have by a wonderful provi- dence, possession of the diamond ring which yol lost." "Impossible!" exclaimed Singleton, "that is where no human hand cal reach it." "Here it is," said Mr. Mildmay, exhibiting the ring. Singleton looked at it, amazed and bewildered ; lie could scarcely credit his own senses. "'Tell me," said he, seizing Mr. Milldmay's Lhaud with fren- zied en yergy, where, where did you get this? Ils God give" yoll poer i over Devils?" "Be quiet," said Mr. Mildmay, afraid for his reason; "get calm, I have a letter to read you." "But that scroll, that yellow scroll, where the Kingc of d: rliness made nme write my own name, in my own blood, to seal me his lo:t, his own for- ever, where is that? you cannot get tliat, no, you cannot get that. And this diamond only comes to mock me!" "Be calm," said Mr. Mildmay, "for a few moments; this letter will ex- plain all."  He lay quietly a short time, and then said, "read it now." The mind of Singleton was low stretched to its utmost tension ; he was all ear. Mr. Mildmayread the letter very deliberately, and distilnctly, and Singleton seemed at once to comprehend the whole mystery. Like a black and dense cloud, carried off by a whrlwind from the sly, so the horror passed away, and the face of his countenance was changed. ' "I am not sold to Satan; I am not lost?" exclaimed he; "Man of God pray for me, me the greatest of criminals. You praved for him, I hope, and was heard? for oh, it is dreadfil to be a lost soul I Pray with mto." Mr. Mildmay, feeling the immeasurable relief in his own mind, came with fresh courage into the presence of the Deity. He prayed indeed; but the system so long strung up to its utmost capability of suffering, gave way under the joyful reaction. WIhern Mr. Mildmay ceased, Singleton was 1schless; but he drew Mr. Midmay's face down  to his and kissced lim. It was an eloquent day, in the very first of June; It was an Epithlanm- rum of the Summer bridal of the Sun and Earth.  There was an intense life everywhere, in the rich hum of the insects among the grass, the stir of the birds, and the breeze, among the thick leaves, the sweet continuous sound of the water; Life was everywhere, and  Iife was love, love brood- ing over all creation, so deeply that if being was not bliss, it was because the heart was not in harmony with, God( and Nature, or bodily infirmity de- stroyed the capacity for enjoyments. Gardening, for which Mr. -Mildmay had a  great passion, was almost a part of his religion, so grateful was he to God for the pleasure it gave hirl  so deeply did he commune with his Maker hrjugh the beautyof his works. The unfolding of the rose to the morniljg, the opening of the fragrant chalice of the lily, were to his holy imagination, sweet discoveries of a Sae viour's love. His family all participated in his taste, and as the day wore  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7095-00000069"/> ^ v           A la .JP z  vi&amp;JUJUa- a awiay, to a most balmy evening, they were all abroad ill the grounds, where the Father's blessing of sunshine and showers, bringing forward vegetation, was rewarding the early labor of the season. Some we e admiring the growth of their plants; some of the children using theik garden imple- ments in workman style. Grace, the eldest sister at home, was engaged very busily in her flower bed, when looking up, she to her joy and surprise saw Helen herself, yes Helen, run down the track into the garden. At once all the family surrounded this beloved one, now again restored to them.- There was great kissing and caressing. After the first warm greeting, Hel- said "now let us hurry into the parlor, for only think, aunt has come home with me, and is waiting to see you, and--she hesitated a little-a gentle- man is there also, who attended us hore." "Who, the lecturer?" asked Grace, archly. Helen said nothing, for looking up, she saw at the window her two com- panions, witnessts of her rapturous welcome home. As they entered the loom, Mrs. Graham came forward to meet her friends, and then said to them "Perhaps you do not recollect Mr. Grey?" 'Indeed I do remember him," said Mr. Mildmay, "but he has much chang- ed, too. There was a great change, not only from the stripling to the man, but there was also a marked change in the character of his countenance." After compliments and greeting had passed, and and all were calmly seated, Authur, a boy of ten, very apt to speak his thoughts, said to Helen, "You never wrote to us about that lecturer; aunt Sealove said she knew you would marry him." Mrs. Graham said, "I see I must put a plain English end to this mystery. Mr. Grey was the lecturer, he has given all for Christ, and he has received a part of his reward here, I think, though Helen would be too humble to admit it in her affection. They are my children, now, brother Mildmay, and I returned here with them, that a union surely made in Heaven, may be solemnized here in my Helen's own dear home. Hlow this all came about, I leave them to tell youl." Helen and Edward had an explanatory conversation with her parents in the evening. "  heard," said Edward, in that conversation, " from my athler, that Helen was married to Charles Bigland. I think he was himself mlisinformed, and did not intend to deceive me as to the fact. The news, however, threw me into a low nervous fever, and I was long in recovering. Tile great clhange took place during the period of my illness, though a text that Helen cited in our memorable walk from the cemetery, was the first word that ever' reached my careless heart. I loved Helen with all my heart, but I was unconscious how well, till I could no longer hope that, at some future day, she might reward the endeavors of which she was the sole stimulus. For I knew that if I fulfilled my heart's dearest purpose, and united my fate with Helen's, I need not expect anything from my father, consequently I was induced to strenuous self-exertion. But when I believed all hope was gone, in the time of my trouble, 1 looked up earnest- ly to God; to Him alone. Great though gradual,/was the Light poured into my mind. Deep and hearty my desires to serve God and man, and   OR, OUR MUSIC AT DAWN.         125 vast the field before me. Immediately I communed, not with flesh and blood, but struck into the path my Redeemer opened before me. My father was incensed; he wreaked on me his utmost anger, and completely disinherited me. But I forgive him, and believe that he will yet relent. "In the prosecution of my work, I was lecturing in Scotland. On the afternoon, when I entered the hall where your daughter and I were des- tined to meet again, it is singular, even though I did not dream of her presence, what a happy glow visited my heart. People said that I had never spoken so well. Perhaps my soul had an instinctive sense whose sweet eyes were upon me. At the close of my lecture, a lady friend said to Ine,-' Mr. Grey, I want to introduce you to Mrs. Graham and her niece.' Helen's veil was down, but she raised it just as the lady said,- Mrs. Graham and Miss Mildmay.' 'Miss Mildmay!' exclaimed 1, forget- ing everybody, every being on earth, but her; 'Is it possible you are still Miss Mildmnay? I heard that you were married.' I'Then you are acquain- ted with Miss Mildmay? ' said Mrs. Graham. I promise you I did not need much'urging to accept the proffered hospitality of Mrs. Graham's house. The two ladies preceded us, and Helen and I walked on together. In that happy walk I learned that she too had been deceived, and thought me engaged to another, but she was not so foolish as to fall sick, as I did. A secret superior influence, whose power I now know, sustained her; while I, poor sinner, had my heart's idol torn from me without any higher affec- tion to sustain me. I now love Helen in Christ, and 1 love her as those only can love, who love in Christ." *  *  *  *  *  *   *  *  *  #  # Miss Jenny Brown came into Mrs. Sealove's parlor, one afternoon, in a more discomposed state than was the wont of tlht self-possessed lady.- But Mrs. Sealove happened to be equally excited, and without noticing the unusual agitation of her friend, exclaimed, on seeing her,- "Have you heard the news?  celen Mildmay has arrived, and her Aunt Graham!" "And where is the lecturer?" asked Miss Jenny. "That's the point I m coming to; " answered Mrs. Sealove, "but you are always in a hurry." "I own I am in a particular hurry, just now; so pray don't have a long story." "Well, then; the lecturcr has come too, and they are to be married di- rectly. There, that is a short story enough for you. But whom do you suppose this lecturer is?" "How should I know?" replied Miss Jenny. "Some Eglishman, I suppose." "It is Edward Grey," said Mrs. Sealove. "  Edward Grey!" repeated Miss Jenny, lifting up her hands and eyes in astonishmernt; "it cannot' be.-le a lecturcr; lie going to be married to Helen Mildmay? His Aunt Cora ought to know, and she says he is a great lawyer, and married to an heiress." "I have always told you, that the Captain said 'Cora Moore might tell  ,  .'  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7095-00000070"/> 1'6           TTH RBVEILLE: her stories to the marines, for the sailors would n't believe them.' I assure you it is as I say." ,; Of course," said Miss Jenlny, *' his father disinherits him." ,' Yes; and Mrs. Graham adopts him. According to his Master's prom- ise, he has lost one parent and found another." ",And now," said Miss Jenny, " let me tell you one more piece of news. There is to be another wedding, and Mr. Mosely wants you to go shopping with me, this afternoon, and give me the belefit of your good judgment in selecting my wedding dress!" CHAPTER     XXXI. MARY WOODLIl'FE. Three weeks after the marriage of Helen and Edward, and the more matter of fact union of Miss Jellnny and Mr. Morely, our friend Mary Wood- liffe, returned from a parting visit, she and her children had been making to Helen, at Woodland cottagge. Aary, though limited in time and means, had'been a inost ardent antld efficient c oadljtor ( f Helen in every good way and worl. She had much enjoyed her visit, and though pained at losing her friend, ler genoerous heart found its consolAtion in seeing Helen happy, She returned horme with many useful tolens of the good will of her friends, -suwch aswould add to the comfort Land good appearance of her dwelling. Jerry returnd from work at noon, and seemed to be very glad to see his wife and children again. Tiey hlad now bt two children remaining; their other little oes had, during these last six years, been taken from this world. ",How came you so nceat," said-Jerry, admiring the nice carpet, and other presents. "All from ourll good friends," said Mary,-"And now, Jerry, let us try to be good ourselves, when God is so good to us." Jerry heaved a sigh, dashed away a tear, and went to his work. Truth- to tell, Jerry did not feel very easy. he had been by degrees, sliding into   ON, OUR  MTRSIC T DAWN.        127 a great intimacy with Hal Wood, now the master of a magnificent estab- lishment. There was every luxurious device, to allure the eye. Large mirrors on every side, from the ceiling to the floor. Then all the paraphla- nalia of the bowl god, was superb. Decanters of the most b)eautiful form, clear as the diamond, and bordered with gold, held the cllhoicest of liquors. Elegant transparent vases, containing the most delicate confectionlrl'y; rich tumblers; pitchers of antique shape.  Even the little casks of liquor were painted, flowered, and gilded. The drooping, gorgeous curt;ains of crimson damask, were draped over the long windows, with gilded tassels. A luxli- rious couch- or two stood in a back recess, shaded by green blind doors.- Flowers of the richest odors, were placed here and there about the shop, shaded by blinds, and cooled by the little fountains. It was a very temple of Bacchus, and the profits of his priests from his deluded votaries, are so great, that they can well afford to make his sanctuaries thus alluring. Here to this place of strong delusion, Jerry, on the strelngth of party ac- quaintance, had been invited. There was always a news table, and he had contracted a habit of dropping in there, to hear the news, as it was stirr- ing party times. At first he was not invited to take any tiling.  At last, one very hot day, a glass of soda was offered; the next day another; then a glass of ale was offered, and ventured on. While Mary was in the coun- try he had been in every day. - He did not feel quite right when he saw her and his children again. Going back to his work that noon, he dropped into Hal Wood's. It was sultry weather. Hal Wood was alone. Tho crystal pitcher stood beside the gilded decanter; the ruby red of the liqour, glowing through.  The room was cool, shady, aromatic. As Jerry came in, Hal poured out some of the liquor, into a sparkling tumbler-anld said, as he lifted the pitcher, " how much water. Jerry?" aMted this he said with that mysterious, indescribable influence, which in fated moments, a strong will has over a 'weaker. They were alone; the temptation hlad been grow- ing stronger anld stronger, ever since Jerry began to fiiequent the shop.- The woman, whlen she first put forth her hand to the goodly fruit, at the instigation of the tempter, was not more strongly induced, than was poor Jerry. He took the glass, he madly quaffed tilhe draught. He had resisted long and bravely. blt the fatal moment had come, and he had fallen into the toils of the insidious betrayer. It was easy to induce him to take the second glass, and the third, and by that time remorse was goue, and he cared not, knew Imt what he did. Hal gave him all lie watated, and he soon became inlsensible. Hal now slipped out to call in his cofebderates. "If you want to have rare spi't," said he to Stronghead and lockheart, whom he found together, " come into my shop, where Jerry oodliffe lies dead drunk." "What! have you caught him?" said Stronghead. "Good news," said Rockheart; "first rate news ; the temperance lectur- ers are beginning to blab again, and this will choke up their mouths pretty well." They soon arrived at the shop. They had their fill of exultation and laughter over him in his beastly state. They then took him out of the ,  #  &#xD;<pb n="128-137" xml:id="VAC7095-00000071"/> 128            THE REVEILLE: genteel saloon, and laid the trophy on the sidewalk, so that all passers by might witness his disgrace. I will tell you what to do next," said Rockheart. "Bring round his  dray, lay him on it, and have him drivei home, so that his wife may see how pretty he looks! I guess it will make Mary Woodliffe look blue.'" "Good," said Stronghead, "I should like to mortify her." So round they brought poor Jerry's dray. On that dray they placed poor Jerry, dead drunk; and followed by a mob of boys and low people, hoot- ing and hallowing, he was driven towards his house. Like all good house- keepers, when they return home, after absence, Mary Woodliffe had spent a busy day, in getting her little domain, in yankee phrase, "to rights."- But every thing was now in ample order; all clean and right. And Mary, having last of all, made her own person clean and' neat, sat down at her open window, to enjoy the evening breeze, little dreaming of the killing spectacle, soon to be presented to her. Imagine her, reader, now at the  window, (and this is no fiction,) the cheerful, innocent, happy wife and mother. She hears a noise, and looking out, perceives a dray coming tow- ards the house, followed by the rabble. As it draws near, she sees a seem- ingly lifeless form extended on the dray.  "Mercy!" she exclaims, "it is my husband; he is dead, and they are bringing him home on his dray!" Down stairs she rushed, and out of the door, up to the dray. What words can describe her feelings on discovering the real truth. She shriek- ed aloud. The bitter, bitter cries of her anguish went up to heaven, even after they had carried in her husband ; but at last she was persuaded to go in. The rum fiends went home, rejoicing in this day of her calamity; but it was a dear bought exultation,-a costly victory, for the " army of the aliens." God is repaying them even now.-Their hour of triumph was their hour of doom. As soon as Mary grew calmer, she caused her children to retire to rest; and seated herself by the bed where they had laid lher husband. She watched over tlat loved, though fallen husband, all night. O, what a night for that faithful, devoted heart. But though her sensibility was strong, so was her energy. The wrestling she had that night with the God of Miri- am, of Deborah, of Judith, strengthened her "ivith strength in her soul." When Jerry began to rous6 from his drunkenness, in the morning, and had come to sufficient consciousness, he looked up to his wife, and said, "Oh, Mary! can you ever forgive me?" "Yes, I can forgive you," said she, but added in a calm, decisive tone, "Jerry Woodlitfe, where did you get the liquor you got drunk with?"  "Oh, wife," said he, "dont ask me now ; I don't want to tell you now; I am very hlungry." "Jerry," she repeated, " tell me where you got the lhquor you got drunk with. I must know this moment." "No! I never will tell you," said he, " so you need not ask." Mary then rose and deliberately locked the door ; then opening the win- dow, she called her son William. He came, as usual, at her first call. She   OR, OUlR M-SIC AT DAWN.         1.37 threw the key out of the Wtindow. "William," said sh ', "take that key, and don't unlock the door, till I bid yol." Then she sat down aa ini beside her husband. "Mary," said he, " what do yout mean? Do you mean to make me a prisoner, and keep nle here'to starve? Conlce I am hnlgry, and I want scomething to eat." "Jerry," said she firmly, '"I am not going out of thlls ellmber, nor shall you, till you tell me where you got the liquor to get drunk with. Depend uplon it, I shall sit here, if it is forever. till you tell me." Jerry knew that his wife's-vord meant somethiing. He turned about unieasily on the bed. "If you a'e bent to have your way, and I know you will, I got the liq- uor at Hail Wood's."  Mary at ollce rose from her seat, threw "p th1 windowr, aid called her son. ' William," said she, " colle noW, alnd Ilillock the door.'" She then put on her shawl and bonnet. "Wherl are y()o goilg 1ow?" asked Jerry, I)own to Harry Wood's." she replied. "Don't do that, Mary; his shop is fill jilst now. Tliat's the reasoin I was loth to tell you wlere I g ot the lilquor; I knw tthat you woulld go tiere, straight as a gun." William now unlocked the door. "You are at iil crty now," said she "and I am going to Harry Wood's." She passed downl street with a rapid step, and a flushed cheek. At last, site drew near the shop. Hal Wood's morning customers were gathering ; among them were some very genteel ones, and one whom Mary Woodliffe well knew. Mary composedly en- tered the shop, and advancing to Mr. Wood, who was bchind his coilnter, said to him,-.-- "Mr. Wood, I have called to ask you to promise me not to sell my hus- band any more liquor." "I shall not promise any such tling," said he. She again earnestly repeated her request. "I shall not; "' said he, " you are an illlm dent woman, and I order you to quit my shop.' Very much moved, but not to be tihus driven away, she knelt before himi weeping, and' besought him to have mercy on lher and hecr clildren ; NIit at sight of her tears and her porseverauce, he only grew harder, and in or- der to compel her to leave the shop, began to wound her delicacy by im- proper language. Tls stung her to the quick, and rousing all her womanly pride, gave a turn to her feelings. When he began his gross attack, she was kneeling at his feet in tears; but now, the fire in her kildling eye quickly drying up her tears, and, in the very rage of her chaste woman- hood, she struck the offender several severe blows, in the presence of* a dozen spectators. Young Charles Bigland, the person whom Mary recog- uized on entering the store, was one of them. He had never, until lately, been a frequenter there. He stood just on the verge of the precipice.-- is 18   &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7095-00000072"/> l Og            TsIE IE VE1il l':  He knew Miary Woodlife- -knew lher respectability and worth. He came forward and said,-- ' Wood, are you not ashamed to insult that respectable woman in that  style? If you are not, I am ashalmed for you, and she has given you just what you deserve." "I thank you, Mr. Bigland," said Mary, ' and as a proof of my grati- tude, I beseech you to come no more to this dangerous place." That was a timely warning to Clarles Bigland, and saved one of the finest young men in the city, mdespite hs parenltage. After this faithfill warnling to 1lim she turned again to thme rlmseller.- "For you, Sir, she said, "if youl dare to sell nmy husband another glass of liquor', I will punish. y),ofmore severely than I have done." So sayilln, she left the sliop, and returned home. She found her husband out; when he dicl return  home, he, vas drRl;, and continued from day to day, to keeD up his deDallchery. Ilht one mort- ing, a lawyer, a temperanlce nlh and a friend of Mrs. Woodliffe's, carme ill, and said to her, "MArs.

"'lley canlnot feel so ba(tly as I do ," said the wife, wit h a deep sigh. "We thlls,'e said the gelntlemnan, "ttere is but onle thi lg we can do, and that is, to tae lhim up and put hm in jail."
