CHAPTER I. "THO a thy slumbers may be deep, Yet thy spirit shall not sleep; There are shades that will not vanisb, There are thoughts thou canst not banishe BYRON'S MANFRED   How surely to every human heart comes the hour when its wayward passions bring their own punishment, when the inward monitor clamors for a hearing, when the memory of a Past comes vividly before us to warn, to threaten, to command I In a handsome house in a crowded tho- roughfare of one of our Southern cities sat a man whose age had been told, not by the slow passage of years, but by the sadder impress of a life of passion and sorrow. The long summer day, with its din and stir of busy, human life, was drawing to a close; but a new page was to be opened upon his own deeply shadowed existence. An open letter lay on his knee, and its contents had stirred, with invisible touch, the memories of a buried Past. Fifteen years had glided from him since the hour when, in the mad- ness of passion, he had turned his young wife from his door, closing his stern heart to her pleadings, and shutting out hope and' gladness from her life. Could he boast that her fair fame was un- tarnished?  No He had banished her very name from his household circle. Quietly she had bidden adieu to her bridal home, leant for an instant over the cradle of their child in all the bitterness of a mother's grief, and passed from his sight, under the light of a star-gemmed  sky, into forgetfulness. If sometimes the memory of her fair face and   tender eyes flitted reproachfully before him, he had crushed the feeling of pity in its birth. Had he not spared her the publicity of shame? And in return she had left to his care their child-his child and hers-- born in the early years of their married life, when the nature that slumbered in her heart had warmed from indifference into a feeling near akin to love. Not till that young voice had poured its music on her ear and warmed her cold heart into emotion and tenderness, did it cry out and waken into life; and with that awakening came sin and sorrow and shame. Enough of the past; our tale leads us on in the train of present events, and the record of a future life which grew from the shadows of that past  Proudly had Philip Grant sus- tained the shock of his misfortune  The dread of detection was quelled, the busy tongue of slander staid, ere its blight had fallen upon his name. lHe had led his child to her mother's grave, and bade her look upon it, and turned thence to clasp her in his arms, and feel springing up from such bitterness a fountain of ten- derness in his cold heart for her, which, lavished upon his wife, had saved her from despair. To-night he held in his hand a passionate appeal from the woman whose voice had not reached his ear through all the long years  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7518-00000004"/> of misery, borne, as he well knew she would bear it, bravely and alone. To no human heart had the wail of her sorrow gone forth. To no human voice had she listened for sympathy. The passage of years had chilled every emotion, palsied every feeling but the undying mother-love that had struggled blindly on; and, dimly hoping that its voice might- find an echo in her husband's heart, she had written : "Philip, in the name of our child, I de- mand the right to see her once more. She is mine by every law of God and nature. No sin of mine can deprive me of the right to my child's affection. From many lips I have learned of your own devotion to her; how your stern nature melts in the fon'dness of fatherly affection. Let that love plead with you for me. Let her generous heart be the judge between us. I ask no more. i If, after years of trial and penitence, you 1 still distrust me, I can only offer you the  assurance of a word never yet broken that  I will make no attempt to win her heart s from  you. Your pride shall not suffer E through me. If she believes me dead, let 1 her believe so still. Only suffer me to be s near her, to look upon her, to watch over a her as none but a mother can, and I will a bless ybu, Philip. Deny me, and I die 1" s Could he deny her?  Alas! for her hope. y Granite was not harder than this man. It h was a despairing appeal, but it woke only an evil spirit in his breast. "So passionate, " so tender," he muttered, "and my love never y won from her coldness one concession. She ir gave to me her beauty, to others her heart. b I never-felt before'that,she had one."  A th cold smile of triumph, wreathed his lip. Yet he was not utterly callous. Could he I see his Judith taken from him and yet live? m Had not he, too, warmed with life under the fr( caresses of his darling, his beautiful child, to the centre around which clung every loftier and better emotion of his soul? Tenderness m for the child was fast melting into pity for ch the wife when he heard a light step on the re] stair, and, hastily thrusting the letter into de his bosom, he turned to clasp her in his rer arms. There was a strong likeness between di( father and daughter, but a likeness softened ha in its pride and shaded,in its marked out- sel lines.                .wi   ld  A womanly tenderness and gentleness diffused itself about her movements; and er as she stood with her delicate hands clasped Id over his arm, her joyous face, so fresh in its )f girlish grace and rich coloring, raised to his, ed the tender mouth parted in a smile of affec- re tion, he could not find it in his heart to ly deny to another the right he deemed so rich n a blessing. Hisearnestgazerested forsome moments on her face before he drew her to e- him and seated her by his side. e  "Have you had any thing to worry you, . papa?" she asked, noting the unwonted t seriousness of his manner. I  He did not speak immediately, but, avert- ; ing his head, answered, "I have been think- s ing to-night of your dead mother, Judith'." I  In an instant she bent down over his t shoulder, but only to pass her hand caress- ingly over his face. It was the first time i that name had passed his lips; and the  daughter heard it reverently, yet with no tother emotion. He had hoped she would t show  some curiosity--ask some question which should prepare the way for what he had to say-but she only waited.    Why should she feel an interest? Her heart was all her father's. His love had been the stay and prop of her young life; his voice and step had been the music for which she yearned; and his tenderness had filled her heart with all it cared to know of happiness. After some moments her father spoke. "You are fifteen years old, Judith; have you ever, in all that time, wanted your mother's care-wished that she, not I, had been left to you-or have I been all to you that I have wished?" "All, dear papa, and more, far more than I can ever tell you. I have never missed a mother's love, and have no heart to spare from you," she said; raising his hand gently to her lips. The shade passed from   his face. He might safely trust them together, upon Ra- ' chefs promise never to reveal to Judith the relationship between them. And there, un- der the clear stars that had looked out se- renely upon Rachel's banishment, with Ju- dith's head upon his shoulder, and Judith's hand in his, the stern man laid upon him- self 'a new obligation toward his injured wife. How deeply injured she only knew.   As strictly should that obligation be fulfilled as had the unfeeling edict of her banishment been. . Filled with tender memories of a by- gone time, he resolved, for once, to act under the dictates of feeling, -and abide the issue. Some misgivings thrust themselves upon his mind. What knew he of the nature of the woman under whose influence he was plac- ing his darling? Sorrow might have softened her into womanliness, or hardened her into that indifference more dangerous than the fitful gusts of passion. Better the wild tem- pest of despair than the dead calm of indif- ference. Better battle with our passions than make them subservient to a strong will where high principle is wanting. The stern silence, maintained with such firmness of purpose, might denote other feelings than penitence and remorse. Yet it might be, as she said, that the strong mother-love that had smouldered through u so many years had burst even the bonds of ] a determined nature; and in the sacredness I of such a love lay his security. On the other hand lay all the difficulties of his posi- l tion. How dwell under the same roof with 1 a woman who, in name, at least, had been a his wife; meeting her face to face, daily, E as a stranger, with Judith's voice giving the c lie to such deception-Judith's clear, truth- a telling eyes upon them? If she wereonly 1 innocent! Ay! and what then? Her pu- t rity would only call thee blacker! But he p knew better. Her own lips had condemned g her.  With blanched cheek and quivering h lip, she had cried: "I have been guilty, d Philip, before God." And with one bound t] his grosser mind had arrived at the great a wrong to himself. He had only acted just- I ly. Great God Justice between man and r wife. Even now, his mind tempered   and d softened by contact with his daughter's pu- f( rity, he refused to accept the possibility that w Rachel's crime lay above such sin as his se code of morals comprised; that to her T there were subtle distinctions which made te it impossible for her to act a lie too often m repeated, of preserving the semblance of a union, where the real union of heart -and ar soul was wanting. Turning from that high- of er law of religion, which would have made re her sacrifice self to the man to whom duty ad bound her, she had accepted perhaps the su   d harder alternative; giving up all but a it bare and cheerless existence through a mis- r- taken sense of duty. Every moral instinct r revolted against her double and detested  union. She had gone beyond the laws of s God in placing her affections upon one se- 3 parated from her beyond all time; she ac- - cepted hei lot as a just punishment, feeling I that truly she was dead unto the world, in ) that the world contained naught -to her but  the one passion that "bound her life in a - vain dream." Without a word of entreaty, a gesture of deprecation, she had severed the links of the past; not glorying in the thought that, by his own act, her husband had given her license to outrage the laws that had made them man and wife; not seeking in the indulgence of a mad passion the dregs of peace and happiness, for her- nature was essentially pure: but with an utter abnegation of self she had made her life the atonement of the sin which she felt. lay between her God and herself. To her husband she had been as true as his nature required. To herself she had been false, and not to her earthly master. would she sue for pardon. So she lived, severed by habit and a sternly imposed: duty from all that in her youth had been, at least, compensation  for wretchedness. But the passage of years which had, left no  trace on the fair, youthful face-a shade,. perhaps, paler than in girlhood-had wrought. greater changes in her nature. United to  her tenderness for the memory of her infant. daughter, blended a higher feeling of duty than that mother's heart had ever known- a feeling of neglected duty toward her child.. Under a fine  but mistaken notion of self- respect, she had withdrawn herself from the double relation of wife and mother-had forfeited the dearest rights of both. Not without much trouble and thought was the self-reliant nature made to own its error. The fine moral perceptions began to be bet- tered by the recognition of a higher law than morality. When religion once dawns upon the heart. and mind of such a woman, the landmarks. of former character are swept away, to be- replaced by a new standard of right rigidly adhered to. It is within the capabilities of such a nature to be eminently good or emi-  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7518-00000005"/> nently wicked; and the formation of either character may be determined by circum- stances scarcely within the control of the individual; and we may sometimes be puz- zled to account for the marked difference of natures -fundamentally the same when brought under the influence of similar cir- c mstances. The first stage in her nature had been the   awakening to warmth and tenderness, and to a corresponding sense of her own weak- ness, under her criminal love for Stanley Powers. The stepping-stone to better things had grown -from the strength imparted to her nature by a strict adherence to a self- imposed obligation religiously kept; and from a first evil sprang a greater good.   CHAPTER H.   * THROUaGH the shadowy past, Like a tomb-searcher, memory ran, Liffltng each aProud th(at the bad cat O'er buried hopes."     MOOBB.   IF a- secret hope of reconciliation with her husband had crept into the heart of Rachel Grant, it was sternly rejected. In vain she had striven to bend to the standard which accepts a seeming right to conceal a real wrong. For years she had tortured her heart with questions of duty; fearful of leaning toward self-indulgence, earnestly balancing her obligations toward herself and toward her child; and years of thought had brought her to this, that her first plain duty was to accept, at the hand of God, the punishment of separation, banishment, and disgrace. The sin, to her, was of no less magnitude that it embraced only the finer part of her nature, engrossed only the higher attributes of her being. She felt no reproach for the deception practiced toward her husband; a sense of humiliation for the implied false- hood was to come when her mind had opened to larger influences under the strug. gles of maternal duty. Never for an instant had the thought suggested itself to her, that the very humiliation which she had not yet learned to consider a duty was the one thing required at her hands. That to own her error, and become a suppliant to her hus- band, was the right thing for her. Had she availed herself of companionship, perhaps the difficulties of her position might have been smoothed away; but her nature was self-reliant and strong, though quiet, and the highest principle of her nature was a sense of duty. Reader, I would place before you the cur- rent of two lives. One where all natural af- fections had been crushed and stifled by the- cold dictates of reason; the other, acting upon every impulse of a warm and genial nature, and trained to the exercise of her noblest faculties-not under the law of reli- gion, but of morality; yielding insensibly to   a bias of affection, ignoring the sternness of I duty where the two conflicted. Religion, properly speaking, neither possessed: the love to God which makes duty, if not a pleasure, yet less irksome for his sake. How those natures bore themselves amid the trials and temptations, we shall see. Every character deserving the name must mark out for itself a separate path of existence, verg- ing sometimes into the great highways of so- cial life, mingling with the turmoil of events, to resume, at will, its individuality, bearing always deeper or more evanescent impres- sions of the current it has stemmed. The lives of those around us insensibly color our own, in a greater or less degree, in proportion to our aptitude for receiving im- pressions; sometimes for good, oftener for evil, as Fae or a higher Will ordains. A vague curiosity as to the manner of their meeting grew uponi her as Rachel neared her husband's home, a home that, but for a refined scruple of delicacy, would have been hers. She would enter not only the walls of that home, but become a dwel- ler of the 1" inner temple," identifying her- self with its dearest joys and deepest in- terests. Filled with such emotions, she leaned forward, with quickening pulse and beating heart, as the carriage drew up at the door. Philip and his daughter were absent, whether intentionally or not she could only guess. Entering hastily, she-found herself in Philip's study, the room most frequently occupied by father and daughter. Years ago she had stood in that room, and listened in despairing silence to her sentence, from lips that should' have spoken only pardon and forgiveness. No breaking up of the shallows denoted pity or affection. Look- ing now upon her husband's portrait, dark- browed, stern-eyed, she seemed again to bear the bitter burden of the taunt that had steel-  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7518-00000006"/> ed her resolve: "My wife an adulturess l" Not the sin that had driven her from him, but pride and a cringing dread of the world's opinion. Ah! how many a one might a word of kindness save from that last step in sin, after which there is rarely a turning back; for degradation brings weakness even to the strong. Bitter memories attached to all that brought her husband before her, and, turn- ing resolutely from all association with him,- she sought some trace of her daughter's presence. Her glance wandered from the portrait of the father to that of the daughter. The pic- ture bore little trace of resemblance to the mother. The dark face, haughty brow, and imperious pose of the small, compact head were all the father's; but over the half-part- ed lips rippled a tender grace all the moth- er's. It was a sweet mouths that seemed pleading for the sternness of'the brow and- eye, and, struck with the peculiarity, Ra- chel paused over it, before turning to the table whereon lay, in drawings and in books, the silent witnesses to the inner life. The drawings were highly finished, and evinced power and taste, though the subjects were scarcely what a healthy mind would have chosen.  Tempering her sunniest fan- cies was a something, more felt than seen, of sadness and depression.  Her books, marked  occasionally with delicate pencil- ings, bore similar traces of character; Shel- ley, Coleridge, Tennyson, Wieland, Schiller, Klopstock, Corneille, and Racine, all bearing on their margins the timid notes of the young reader. A sad smile played over Rachel's lip as, she noted the incongruity of the mass before   her. "So young, and such food l" The -marked passages gave evidence of thought I and feeling,'and Rachel lingered over them, silent voices speaking more freely of the heart than her daughter's would. Days and weeks elapsed before they met, and before that timne Rachel had formed a fair estimate of the character of her child, learning from every silent page of the virtues and defects, vividly apparent to the watchful eye of affection. With a woman"s ready tact, she smoothed away the difficulties of a first meeting with her husband, and Philip found himself gra- dually becoming familiarized to the vision of his fair-haired wife, moving noiselessly through his house, filling it with the influ- ence of her presence, while the memories which had clung with such bitterness to his early life faded before the new aspect of things. - In form and face she was still the Rachel of their wedded life; but the silvery laugh that had once pealed from her lips, the jest, the song, the innocent mirth that- had grown familiar to the days when his evil genius had stalked beside her under the name of Stanley Powers, had fled, and he could think of her now carelessly, ipdiffer- ently. To her finer temperament, a reunion under his roof was torture, buried, with a woman's pride, under a calm exterior. In the occasional solitude of his absence the passionate cry for peace pealed from her lips, to be soothed into quietude at her daughter's step. . Her prayer had been granted, her wish gratified beyond her hope, and now she had learned that around all human affections ' cling the shadows of a greater sorrow.,   CHAPTER II. "LOVE, fame, ambition, avarice, 'tis the same, ; l For all are meteors with a different name." BYRON.   AMoNa Judith's chosen associates was Hillory Grey. Of fine person, frank and manly bearing, upright in nature, noble in principle, he possessed all the fresh enthu- siasm that appeals so strongly to feeling that we sometimes overlook the grave defects which it often conceals. He had won upon Rachel's interest, and she watched with pleas- -ure his growing intimacy with her daughter. In Judith the energy of a misdirected intellect had weakened her moral perceptions. Grey was no metaphysician; 'consequently, the defects of her .character. produced only an uneasy sensation in her presence, which, in her absence, was forgotten, while the memory of her grace and beauty remained. A keen observer would have noticed that in the man lay the moral superiority; in the woman, the intellectual. To his fine moral perceptions was added the firmness of high principle, while to every commonplaced of. existence was applied the touchstone of religion. This was his divin- ing-rod; no need of the metaphysician's wand. With a gift of intuition, he arrived at the knowledge of good or evil, yet with a far-reaching magnanimity that put the evil from him, a guilelessness that rejected the impurities of society. If the daily contact of a pure nature could counteract the poison she imbibed from books and the society of ( her father, such gain was Judith's. Yet only when that simplicity of the sublime in  his character awakened the feeling in herself, i did she acknowledge its presence. Virtue t and purity in the abstract never appealed ( strongly to her feelings: but here they be- came embodied in one who began to exer- t cise a powerful influence over her; calling 1 into action a quicker sympathy with her 1 fellow-creatures, teaching her that the true 1 poetry and heroism of life lay among the  lowly images in nature's great household no    less than amid the grander creations of her genius. From him she first learned to see duty in every act of her daily life; not the cold, hard image which reflected itself from Ra- chel, but imbued with an earnestness that could make humility grander than heroism. This theory she derived from his practice; to her it was but theory, producing little change in heart or manner. The mind recognized the embodiment of her artistic conception of the beautiful in hu- man character, and bowed before its pre- sence, and she learned to love him. The mind acknowledged her ideal of manly perfection, the heart worshiped its concep- tion. Yet if Hillory Grey was- ever called upon to exercise forbearance, it was with the earnest trifler he had made his friend. Assuming an authority none other ventured, he had freely remonstrated with her upon the erroneous views she cherished until, stung by her mocking replies, hie would leave her hastily, angrily, deeming perhaps that he had overrated her susceptibilities. Once only, unsettled by his earnest remonstrance, she had cried: "Enough, lMr. Grey; it is not that I will not; it is that I can not." Struck with her earnestness, he was about to reply, when Philip Grant laid his hand on his daughter's head, saying:L "What would you find, my daughter? ' The true philosophy of life'? If so, perhaps I can assist you." The words were spoken mockingly: "I am an old man. All paths in life have been open to me. Ambition, honor, fame. I have drained each cup to the lees, and retain only the remembrance of bitterness. After all, perhaps, pleasure is the true philosophy of life. 'Its enjoyment renders us alike indif- ferent to the sparkling baubles of ambition, dead to the influences of a nature which we can not satisfy, and whose demands only tor-  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7518-00000007"/> ment without raising us to better things. Perhaps the true way to be happy is, first, to lose our susceptibility to!the transient emotions which create unrest; to forget that our nature demands more than animal en- joyment; to quench every softer feeling; to sleep in pleasure; to dull, by the routine of every-day frivolities, even the faintest spark of that Promethean fire which utilitarians properly, perhaps, denominate romance." The sensual face had grown coarser, and the deep-set eyes glowed with a light from which even Judith shrank, as he uttered sentiments so revolting to a woman. Our natures may be beguiled by subtle poisons, gracefully administered but here stood, in naked deformity, the mind whose capabili- ties scarcely comprised more than the names of the attributes he profaned. Grey had listened in silent indignation and disgust to the utterance of such sentiments from the lips of a father to his young daugh- ter, but, mastering with a strong effort his contempt, he turned partly to Judith, ex- claiming: "Believe it not, Judith I It is only the prostitution of our noblest faculties which can fill us with bitterness. True, we live in a workaday world, where scarce one rises to distinction in the various paths of pursuit. Yet the opportunities are ours, if we will avail ourselves of them. If we can lay aside that great stumbling-block to good--self- we can attain, at least, the highest earthly good, and happiness is inseparable. As for romance, keep it, dear Judith, a companion at least to your youth, Alas I I fear it rare- ly follows us beyond the arch of middle age. It is the enchantress's wand which can clothe life in the misty splendor of forgotten days, peopling again the hard, grinding world with fairy images of truth, and beauty, and light. Possessing within ourselves the power of imagination and fancy, the mind may roam at will through the labyrinth of remote scenes, and linger, rapt and absorbed, amid the finer fancies that have peopled this world with Sydneys and Bayards. - Woo it in every form, and you may sometimes fancy that the spirit that now whispers of beauty and peace to you lent its persuasive voice to charm from its woes another heart, laden, like yours, with the barrenness of life. Say that it de- ceive but for a moment; that, ere the pulse   has quickened an instant under the spell, it has vanished, and darker, grimmer seems the frown of reality. Yet, for that one instant, we have been dispossessed of some of the accumulated weight of years. Its impress, however slight, has been written in the rose- ate hue of our day-dreams. And perhaps, in after years, when time has brought grav- er thoughts, hardening more than our brows with the lines of care, and hurrying us on in the train of deeper feelings and loftier emo- tions, steeping our natures more sternly with the richer draughts of life-ay, when having quaffed deeply of pleasure and sorrow, and, perchance, crime-we pauseunder the dark archway of a future life, and only the lees in our cup, we may turn to that one season of a brighter day when, even for an instant, time stood still; when romance vailed the future, oblivion shrouded the past, and hope lingered at our side." "The philanthropist only can dream vain dreams of finding happiness with the gushing of life-springs not his own. The knowledge we gain of life fromn experience and our own secret thoughts give the lie to such hope. We can only find happiness within ourselves," said Judith in a low voice. "Ay, girl! the game is in our own hands: we may sometimes play recklessly, and lose all; and often with the trump cards in our hands, we follow the dictates of a relentless and cruel fate, and find at last that we are crea- tures without volition, and with not energy enough to combat with our own vile natures.' It was Philip who spoke the last words, in that bitter, cutting voice whose tones could yet mellow to the softest notes of affection toward his child: and it was this very coarseness, bringing put the strong points in his character in vivid contrast to his tenderness for her, that had won; from Judith so deep a devotion that it blinded her to his defects. Rachel had been an unseen listener to the conversation, and. with a pang had heard such sentiments tacitly ac- cepted by the daughter. True, her idea had been conveyed in the more refined medium of womanly thought, yet it had laid bare the tendency of her mind, and that tendency was self. Not the petty selfishness that could control her intercourse with those around her, but that tendency to draw on   her own heart for enjoyment; her own mind striving to meet its intellectual requirements, and naturally withdrawing her from all sym- pathy with her kind. Not feeling that, "Man needs manklnd must be confest, In all he labors to fulfill Must work or with or for the rest." How should she save her child from such in- fluences? The stronger will of Philip Grant carried greater weight than Greyt's The very gentleness that won her to love Hil- lory caused her to underrate his mental ca- pacity; and Rachel had long learned that one who would govern such a nature must possess strength, both of mind and will, greater than her own. Hoping, therefore, little from the intercourse with Grey, she determined to seek Philip alone, and remon- strate with him upon the expression of such sentiments in the presence of her daughter. He could not question her right to make such an appeal, even in the capacity of go- verness. In grave silence he had listened to her, and when she ceased, with curling lip and knitted brow he had answered her: l"If I understand you aright, you disapprove the sentiments I expressed to-day in the hearing of my daughter. You would have me play the hypocrite before my child, nursing with- in my own bosom the thoughts which have tortured my whole existence. To whom should I confide, if not to her? . Whom?" he continued angrily. "How dare you stand e before me to plead for silence, lest a spoken i thought of mine should stain the morals of I your child? Womanl whose right should it have been to teach her young heart truth 1 and purity? making her young mind mirror { the virtues of your own Who made me deem virtue and truth but the chimeras of r disordered brains-the alluring baits of hy- t pocrisy held out to cheat men's fancy?   "Blame me not that, out of the grand fab- ric of life, I have wrought only bitterness and unbelief. The young life that has grown from mine has, perchance, mirrored the disorder which has fastened itself upon me, Can I look in her sweet face, and prate of what to me is the veriest cant? Let this subject never be named between us more, unless you would forfeit the right that love for her has wrung from me. Rachel, you have sorely tried me--touched me in the poitnt from which my pride, no less than my affection, revolted. Yet you can stand before me coldly, calmly, with such an air of virtu- ous reproof upon you that you almost cheat mny senses of their belief in your guilt. Yet those lips so purely beautiful have told me truth?"The last words interrogatively and with a tremulous eagerness which he'could ill conceal. Could it be, that at the depths of his dark nature lay still some faint, ten- der memories of his lost wife, which could make him cling even now to a hope rather- than a beliefjihn her innocence? It was a study for an artist to watch them standing there face to face. He, so eagerly waiting for the words which yet hung upon her lips, all the anger melting from his fierce eyes-now aglow with admiration for her who stood before him in the clear west- ern light, so fair, so beautiful; with the glow of injured feeling lighting her large eyes, her lips striving vainly to utter the words that leaped up from an overcharged heart. "Papa!"It was Judith's voice that came between them, bringing them from a dim past to a real present. Coldly he held the door for her to pass, neither speaking; and returned to himself his child, his world.  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7518-00000008"/> CHAPTER IV. "An t there's nothing half so sweet in life As Love's young dream." MOORE.   GREY had left Judith's presence with very much the feeling with which we survey pme faultless portraiture of art-faultless indeed to the casual observer, yet to an artist eye speaking painfully to the soul its defi- ciency. His absence occasioned her pain: springing from sentiment and feeling; yet not that void which, had he filled the mea- sure 'of her being, had been hers. The world, which rarely yields its homage to him who most deserves it, had heaped with sunshine the life of Hillory Grey. Bearing about him that nameless something which wins its way to all hearts, he hadl caught the joyous inspiration of success, disarrAing malice, deprecating censure. Had such virtues been united to strength of mind and will, its influence over Judith's char- acter would have been strong and perma- nent, developing and insensibly giving its bias to her own. But the mere power of innate virtue and purity was insufficient. The natural outpourings of Grey's nature 4 were to good; the natural expression of his ( mind, virtuous. There was little conflict of passion and principle; and from the wres- tlings of such spirits in a strong man's bo- 1 som rises 'the grand ideal. Then, from the  trammels of a sinful nature is wrought out i the highest standard of human excellence. Man's weakness, is the strongest barrier c which Providence has placed to the attain- t ment of a perfect nature; yet occasionally 1 we are brought face to face with the reality c of our ideal, or, at least, its near approach f in  man  to the Divinity-natures which s seem to breathe the essence of Christian love and beauty, pure and stainless amid d the corruption around them, teaching us the D life which we must stoop to win. Not less v beautiful is that type of a larger class who, to from the first bitterness of sin, extract the p essence of a higher existence; who, from p   r the energy of remorse, derive strength to D become noble and excellent. And it is to the influence of such natures among -us that we towe much of the good that has been effected. Natures which have appealed in the strong accents of sympathetic feeling-which have emerged from fierce conflicts, bearing the presence of such struggle about them-- plunging w/ith us through the difficulties which kindred feeling has engendered-no barrier raised by forms and precedents can limit the progress of such natures. Grasp- ing the good with all the energy of remorse, noting with eyes grown keen in the survey of their own defects each stepping-stone to good, success must be theirs. Only natures weak and unstable can sink into depths of infamy-natures which are. led or fall into error, not committing sin with a firm sense of right willfully put aside. To such belong, ofttimes, the sudden development of dor- mant energies; directed, perhaps, oftener to evil than to good; and perhaps the first ten- dency of such development of hidden strength may be'to blind and mislead; yet, possessing the germ of a noble nature, with a deter- mined will, the soulwill not long remain in error. No! even through the Crimson flush- ing of sin we may yet discern and follow the higher path. Often, w/ith sin comes that quick discernment of the errors of our na- ture: we behold ourselves under the strong light of a new revelation. Regeneration comes not to all alike; and God has' merci- fully enfolded his weaker creatures in the shadow of his own attributes. Drawn by no feeling of sympathy to Ju- dith, Grey had lingered through the sum- mer, until higher duties called him else- where. Then the faint image-which he re- tained of her vanished before the first real passion of his manhood. After many months, passed in sweet, girlish dreams-a soothing   sense of apathetic pleasure-the new life shining in the shadowy depths of her starry eyes, and lingering in softened smiles about her tender mouth, Judith awoke to the first real pain her young life had known. Reared with the indulgence of an overweening af- fection, she had passed the boundary of girl- hood, gliding into womanhood as some pla- cid stream, flowing seemingly deleper under the shadows which. darken it. Her first, scarcely defined, love for Hillory Grey marked the progress of her womanliness, developing itself under the subdued grace of womanly passion in all its purity and strength. Not until the warm blood had left her ripe lips white and tremulous, and the liquid eyes grew dim with unshed tears, had she realized the first sorrow whose sha- dow fell athwart her path. Standing, dumb and cold, in the sunshine of a winter's day, she held Grey's letter in her hand, rousing at length to look piteously up at the danc- ing light under a heavenly sky, and wonder why it had grown so dark. What a mockery seemed now that joyous sunshine! The letter was full of that gushing happiness speaking so forcibly of the writer; bringing to her, in all its bitterness, the memory of that ringing tone which, to her, had never sunk to the low whisper which love for another had taught it. The letter ran: "DEAR JUDITH: Let me call you so now, if ever, when the expression of your sisterly sympathy will make you dearest of all but her who has crowned my life with happi- ness. Bid me bring her to you, Judith; this lovely creation-form and archetype of womanly virtue. Enthusiasm will furnish me with no language in which to discourse most eloquently of my Elinor; mine, Judith, by her own tremulous confession; and all my heart can wish of happiness is comprised in this. If truth and purity ever speak from gentle eyes and sweet lips, my Nellie's teach me faith. Yet, why tell you all this-you who, from every word of mine, have learned what grace mny wife must possess? Your loving heart will call my Elinor sister, and prove as blind to her defects, if any there are, as the short-sightedness of her lover, "HLLORY GREY."' That was all.   No word which could   wound; yet how cruel seemed the happi- ness that had bubbled from heart to pen I Poor Judithl IIow blank and dreary all seemed to that young life, counting its six. teen summers-moaning out her misery with a dumb hopelessness more piteous than tears. Crushing under her small feet the freshy springing flowers, which but that morning had spoken eloquently from their soft, green beds of their beauty and life to her own happy heart-now turning with loathing from them to clasp with her cold, slender fingers the pages of Grey's letter. Look with no scorn upon the sorrow of that young heart; not less real, not less earnest than the stronger passion of ma-. turer years; yet how infinitely purer, more beautiful! Alas I that such love can come but once in a lifetime! The ephemeral beauty of such passion dies with our youth. To that young girl standing there, with heaven's sunlight pouring its glory around her, bathing the world in beauty and splen- dor, came a sudden feeling of shadows creep- ing between her and the light. The roar of the great city ceased suddenly, dying away under the clasp of the iron hand that had gathered her heart-strings in its hold-the musical dash of the fountain, beside which, but a few-hours before, she had lain, watch- ing the spray of the jet as it sprang to catch the quivering arrows of gold from the rising sun: then rolled together in one sheetof glory over the purple mist that curled around the spires and roofs of the Crescent City. Grief wears but one badge; and the bright- ness faded from the dim eyes that fastened upon the blurred page before them. Raising them, she beheld her father standing before her, looking down upon her; every coarse feature working with the sympathy which had made him quick-sighted. With a rough exclamation, he seized the letter from her hand, ran his eye hastily over it, and with a fierce imprecation trampled it under foot. Then, turning to Judith, he opened his arms. With a sharp cry she sprang to that broad breast whose sympathies were all her own; hung tremblingly to him, while he folded her roughly there, crushing the slender form in his great arms, pressing his lips to the poor white ones held so pleadingly to him;  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7518-00000009"/> striving with awkward caresses to soothe his child. "Papaapat" she cried at length, with a pasionbath burst of weeping, and brokenly the ouh voice of the strong man came like musf to her ear, "My child, my own darlin'!" What need of more? She glided frdm his arms to seek the quiet of her own chamber, mindful, even then, of him, and turning once to look mute- ly up into his face. before she passed from his sight. For days she lay there, quiet, composed, scarcely thinking or feeling; only replying to her father's terms of endearment by t silent caress absently bestowed- a sympathy sadly needed and thankfully re- ceived. "Papa," she at length whispered, so low that he stooped to catch the words, "will you answer it--  can not?" and the pale face was turned quickly from him. No greater proof could Philip Grant have given of his passionate devotion to his child than when, with cursing and bitterness in his heart, he penned the brief note of congratu- lation, stating Judith's illness as excuse for her silence.  How that sai face haunted him I coming between him:nd every oc- cupation which had once naff hoime plea. sant. The heavy volumes, tWnt to beguile time of its slow passage, lay upon his knee, while the eyes that scanned the open page saw  only his child, alone in her trouble, save for him. In those restless hours came 1 the first lash of remorse.  How gently a 4 mother's voice might win her from her sor- s row,; how sweet that feeling which might i   edraw husband and wife together, even over t the sorrow of their only child I That child, , for love of whom he had learned to abstain from the coarse vices of his youth and man- hood ; letting her sweet voice, reading from his favorite books, lull the fever of his rest. less mind. And, when again she crept to his arms, laying her head once more upon his Shoulder, pouring again upon his ear the music of her voice, he bowed before the presence that Was warring against pride, stubbornness, and sin. One more letter had come from Grey, written in the same flush of joyous inspira- tion, scarcely repressed when mentioning regretfully Judith's illness. And Judith had put it with a drawing of her owns-his likeness-taken in the sultry hour of a sum- mer's noon, when he lay asleep beside her fountain: one hand clasping his rich, brown curls, through which the quivering sunlight strayed; the ripe young blood mantling on his brown cheek; the long, dark lashes sweep- ing heavily over the glad, blue eyes that mirrored all manly virtue. Wrapping it closely in his letter, she had walked down to the river; and, while the sunset light streamed broadly over the water, leaned qui. etly down and  dropped them in the lap- ping waves. For some moments they went dancing on down the current, then sank from her sight. She had put away all mem- ory of a lost hope in the black depths of the swift-running river; and thus ended her first day-dream I   CHAPTER V., "AND canst thou not accord thy heart In unison with mine?"   THE slow winter passed away. Spring came, and with it Judith's spirits in some measure regained their tone. The pangs of youth are short and sharp ; and the current of life flows on, rarely disturbed by even the memory of what was once so bitter. It is only when the probe is applied in later life that we gather up remembrances of that struggle, and are spurred on or dragged down by the remembrance. There was a tone of quiet melancholy about her, giving the charm which her manner had hitherto wanted. Rachel had never won upon her; and, living in her father's presence, leaning with- him over his huge, dusty volumes, or, pen in hand, writing at his dictation, the young student forgot that a gay world moved around her; that her age gave her the right to leave the grim world of letters and learn something of the life around her. But Ra- chel did not; and made Philip at length un- derstand that he was not to be the sole com- panion of that fair young life; and must put his darling from him, or leave his quiet and go forth with her; and with a weary sigh he acquiesced. After Rachel left him, he had sat quite silently studying the pro- blem. Could he spare her from his side-- his only one--his ewe lamb?- Yet more, could he trust himself again in that world whose allurements had proved too strong for him until he had her to love? Mingling with this was a tinge of regret that the beau- tiful, cold woman who had just left him was his no longer. We have said that Philip Grant was a sensualist; yet, as if to redeem his youth, had been his love for his wife free from such taint. Now, in his renewed intercourse with her, he was beginning to distrust himself; to believe that it might have been better for him to have trusted her - and in this thought he unconsciously unbent in her presence. But time, and the coarse taunts which had made her early res-   idence under his roof so galling, had left in Rachel's mind only disgust and abhorrence. True to the only passion of her life, she held the image of him she loved fresh in her heart; yet thanked God day and night that to such love humiliation had never succeed- ed; that, should she ever meet Stanley Powers, it might be with an unblushing cheek. It was yet quite cool, and Judith had gone out for a walk. This she took daily, just before dusk, walking rapidly, with her eyes bent down; not stopping to look in at shop windows, or seeming to notice the lingering glances that often followed the slight, grace- ful figure, seeming so sadly out of place and alone, with her bent brows and rapid step, as if in perplexed thought. Such walks might bring color to her cheek, but they brought neither youth nor gayety to that young life. Rachel had, once or twice, offered to accompany her; but Miss Grant had a quiet way of declining obtrusive atten- tions which admitted of no question. . When the lights were shining far down the street, she would turn suddenly and retrace her steps as rapidly, never pausing until she reached her own door, when she went at once to her father. On the evening which Rachel had chosen to propound her question, so again disquiet- ing Philip's serenity, Judith had walked quite out of the bustle of the city, and, feel- ing slightly out of breath, rested for an instant on one of the railings, which inlosed a square guiltless yet of tree or shrub, and which cer- tainly presented no attraction to the eye of the young student. Her cloak had fallen, with its hood, from her shoulders; and she was watching, with some appearance of interest, a landeau which rolled toward her, and in which sat two ladies. One might have been about her own age,  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7518-00000010"/> yet so childishy beautiful was the fair face that Judith gazed upon it spell-bound. She was chatting gayly with the lady at her side, and, suddenly noticing Judith, made some remark, upon which her companion turned her head, and discovered a pale face lighted by a pair of fine, clear, gray eyes. In an- other instant she heard her own name pro- nounced eagerly, and the third occupant of the carriage strove to descend. It was Hil- lory Grey! In an instant she had started from her recumbent posture, and, with a quick, haughty bend of the head, turned and passed rapidly down the street. Alas I poor Judith I In that one sad, scornful - glance, Hillory had read her secret, and turned slowly back, with a guilty conscious- ness, to his place beside his companions; I and the carriage rolled on. That fair, sweet * face, with the golden curls and sunny brow, I was his wife I Envy and bitterness gave c speed to her footsteps; and she flew rather 1 than walked home, and dashed, panting and a breathless, into Philip's study. Then, kneel- ing beside 'him, she kissed him and whis- e pered, "Papa, you have not finished your tf volume; and see, I have got the next. It s came this morning, and  I have cut the a leaves."                d Philip's only answer was to put out his n hand and stir the embers in the grate; then, of by its light, he saw two young, tremulous pe lips striving to speak commonplace, and at two young eyes drooping under his gaze. so Drawing the dark head on his breast, he sc passed his hand caressingly over it, whis- as pering, "What is it, my darling? What is w it?"                  he And the man, who had read his daughter's do secret in the fire-light, heard it from her lips.. w "I have seen him," she cried tremblingly, 4" seen him and his-his wife."     pa So the problem  was solved; and Philip an Fang for lights, and gave Judith her tea ma with his own hand, and after she had drank Ba it, said, "Now  listen, my daughter, for I vie have been reading a story, and will tell it he you."                  spa Yet Philip seemed in no haste to tell his I story, but sat looking forward into the grate cri when he had taken hei cup and sent away the pit tea. Strangely unnerved this man always be- tur came when brought from his quiet world of she   ace thought into the swift tide of human life, 'he whose questions of practical interests per- de, plexed him more than the knottiest points of ne philosophy or history. Moved by doubts of his ed own capability to contend with a world which ed he had once put from him, and in which he n- had palpably failed to act a part. Where 'o- was the secret of his failure? He had mind, of talents of no ordinary degree; yet they had il- never raised him even to a level with men Ad upon whose mental abilities he had looked a with scorn; and, in disgust, he had with- d drawn from all the influences of social life I3 into a hard, dry world of his own, with only i1 one tender, gentle feeling of affection, that d made life not all forlorn. 3- Through the influence of that love he had ; discarded vice, thius paying a homage to t virtues which he pretended to despise; and , now could he, at a second command, come e out from his home and teach his daughter's r heart to share the love all his own with i others? Gathering her to him, in words plain, yet eloquent with strong feeling, he went back ' through the past, bringing his life, with its strength and its errors, before her, and with a touch of rude pathos -that went to his daughter's heart, bewailed the vices that made him shrink from unfolding, any part of that life to her, winding up with an ap- peal to her if she could guard her own truth and purity amid a world that he had found so false and cruel. But Judith, pitying his sorrows, saw nothing in such. temptations as he painted to disturb her. With a  true womanly instinct, she read the world from her solitude with a  simple, womanly wis- dom, or perhaps faith would be the' better word. Philip saw that he had failed, and, scarcely pausing in his narrative, changed its identity, and drew in vivid coloring, with a rough but masterly hand, a woman's life in' the great Babel without.  It was, perhaps, a  hard view, a  contemptuous disregard of sex; but he had felt its truth, suffered from it, and spoke as only such can speak. It was a simple tale of love, decgit, and crime-justice on the one side, meriiy arid pity on the other; and, relying upon a na- ture so like his own, he had cried, "What should he have done, Judith?"   She had risen, and stood before him with flushing cheek and glistening eyes, crying, "She was but a woman, loving perhaps, yet not guilty, striving with her secret sin, pray- ing that her burden might be made lighter by a husband's noble forgiveness and pro- tection. Ah! my father, she was but a woman. I would pity and forgive." With almost- a groan of disappointment, Philip had turned from her while she spoke. Perhaps he had never doubted that, if brought face to face with her mother's guilt, the child's heart would be with him; and now he hated Rachel with a double hatred. Alas I it was the woman for whose fate the- girl's sympa- thies had been enlisted; the mother had as yet no place there. Had Rachel listened to this pitying vindication of her sex, she might perhaps have forgotten her promise to the father in-the joyful hope of pleading her own cause with the daughter, whose hand .she now touched as a stranger; perhaps to hear the daughter's voice raised to denounce, not the woman's sin, but the destruction of her father's happiness. Could she rely upon- one who rather followed the passionate im- pulses of her heart than the calmer dictates of reason? She.-ould be no judge where her heart had already given its verdict; but seeing nothing in Philip's tale to make her suspect his deep interest, she had answered from the heart softened by her own hopeless 1 attachment, just brought again so painfully ] before her; and that answer had been in X sympathy with her age and sex. The mature mind of worldly wisdom would have paused,   perhaps, to discuss the question of moral influence and social position. The young girl saw only, in the vivid picture, a crea- ture struggling, like herself, under the bitter pang of a hopeless attachment, and became her champion. Graver talk succeeded; and Judith became acquainted with her father's wealth, his position, the social influence which should be his, and agreed, with an almost uncon- scious rearing of her head, that society had claims upon Philip Grant and his daughter which should be recognized. He drew a sketch of her future life which well might charm and dazzle, and which, looking round upon the sombre walls of her father's study,. and the silent companions of her childhood, she might deem a glimpse into fairy-land. She sat smilingly by his side, her bitter consciousness of pain lost in contemplation of the new life that awaited her, and this. time Philip's picture and his fatherly elo- quence were no failure. He saw the dark head pillow itself on his breast, and eyes shining with the bright dreams of youth-- dreams which, alas! how few of our waking hours ever realize-and he murmured thanks that it was yet in his power to drive this. youthful passion from the breast of his child. For a few bright hours no selfish thoughts mingled with his musings. And not until her head lay pressed upon her pillow did he allow his own darker thoughts to mar the contemplation of his daughter's future.  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7518-00000011"/> CHAPTER VI. "How long must I conceal What yet my heart could wish were known?"   THE, morning dawned joyously, with the golden glory of our Southern land, and, with one look at the sunshine without, Judith hastened her simple toilet, and sought her father. Rachel was with him, and cut short their ,endearments with the announcement that ibreakfast had been waiting for some mo- -ments. The mail-bag had been opened, and Philip leisurely perused his letters, while Miss Grant, with more dignity than belonged to her years, presided over the repast. Ra- chel, cold and abstracted as usual, leaned -idly back in her chair, scarcely touching the ,dainties which Judith courteously pressed -upon her. She had noticed the increasing pallor of that fair face, and strove, with a -gentler manner, to soothe one whose lot she felt must be so lonely. Suddenly Philip broke the silence, and, handing an open letter across the table, cried: "There, Judith, brace your spirits to en- -counter a long, dull summer in this hot and dusty city; for my agent writes me that the :house he had my orders to purchase can ,not be given up until the fall. It is a great -disappointment to me," he continued pee- *vishy. "Your bloom will never come back -in such an atmosphere, and the summer will ,be-a long and hot one." Judith had run her eye rapidly over the "Ietter, and now laid it down again with a slight sigh. Philip's words of the night be- fore had raised such bright visions of the new life which the new home was to inaugu- ;rate I She had dwelt with a feeling of relief ,upon the thought that, in leaving the noise and jarring of the great Babel, she would lose the inquietude, the restless, dreams so full of pain; and find in a country home a sweet paradise, where the beauties of nature imight woo her spirit to peace. This had been the fancy of the girl whose youth had    not yet learned that not in our surroundings ilies the power to bring peace to an unquiet heart; Ithat the sweetest aspects of nature often add torture to an aching breast from its calm contrast to the conflict within; that only within us we bear the power to quell rebellious thought. "Papa," she said, turning to him, " why not travel during summer? I am very weary of my quiet life. I know so little of the world beyond the city." And she passed quickly to her father's side, and laid her hand on his shoulder. An expression of pain had passed over his face at the avowal that her life with him had become wearisome; but a glance at the pale face made him forget all but that. The anticipations he had raised of a gay life on the night before had Passed from her in the broken slumber into which had stolen the image of that fair, sweet face that had brought so much misery to her; and the dark-circled eyes pleaded more strongly than her words had done. "Yes, my daughter, we will go; and when the bloom returns to this cheek, the light to these eyes, or when Judith wearies of the world- and pleasure, we will come back to our books and our memories that are too deeply blent with your life, and my happiness in you, to give place without pain to other scenes, where others must share with me my daughter's heart and smiles." "My smiles, perhaps," she. said tremu- lously; " but not my heart, father." They had forgotten Rachel's presence-- forgotten every thing but the sweet feelings and tender thoughts that forbade words, and stood for a few moments with clasped hands silently. She had watched them with motionless lips and dry eyes, this poor mother, like some stricken thing, in her dumb, hopeless pain; despairing more, day by day, as the   conviction forced itself upon her, that she could be nothing to a heart so filled with a father's love, that even to the dead mother she gave no sigh. They turned to her at length. Philip, with his eagle eye, had caught the suffering look, and a flash of triumph passed into his face. Judith saw only a weariness born of solitude, and per- haps, of physical suffering, and said gently: "I am quite glad, too, of the change on your account, Rachel; you will be pleased to go, you look ill." "My head pains me to-day," murmured the unhappy woman, rising and going to- ward the door. As she passed Philip with an unsteady step and hueless cheek, he felt some compunction for his heartless triumph. "Mrs. Harleigh," he said formally, "'per- haps you will be kind enough to assist Miss Grant in her preparations; and, if you have any preference of place, I would gladly be guided by your wishes." She had resumed her self-composure before he closed, and an- swered: "As your daughter's governess and com- panion, I should rather be governed by her wishes. I have no choice of place." He said no more, and she passed from the room. Judith bit her lip in silent vexation. Thus ever wider grew the gulf between the mother's heart and the child's she dared not win-coldness on one side, aversion on the other. A few days of busy preparation, and   they wended their way northward-I, like Philip, linger, loth to leave the old house, where so often fancy has dwelt upon its sweet pictures of domestic love. Standing out vividly in my memory is that dark and silent room, where scarce a sound disturbed the hours through which they sat-father and daughter--alike wrapped in the studies which possessed a common interest, Some- times the maiden mused, a&amp; youth will, even where four walls have made its world. And what but gentle musings could come to one so sheltered by protecting love? The book dropped on her knee; she had sat, smiling, in her youthful beauty, with so witching a light in the sweet eyes, that Philip forgot his own graver occupation to-watch her. Was it wise to pass from such a wealth of quiet happiness to a doubtful world of pleasure beyond? Can the world's homage make thy heart. prouder, Judith, than the glance of eyes from which you turn with a happy blush? Can it be, that beneath that rapt repose of manner there burn slumber- ing passions of ambition? Eyes now so still under their long, sweeping lashes may flash brightly to the whispers within. Fain would I linger with thee, parent and child, in the holy beauty of thy marvelous level Fain lure thee back to charm once more my fancy with the sweet picture that shall dwell in my memory when the world hath claimed thee for its own!  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7518-00000012"/> CHAPTER YII. "EAGER to hope, but not less firm to bear; Acquainted with all feelings save despair." BYol.   IT was the fourth of March, and the an- nual procession of the firemen moved slowly up the street, followed by the usual attend- ance of the city rabble, ready for any diver- sion which might prove an excuse for de- serting more profitable occupations. It paused at the head of Royal street for a few moments, then passed on, saluted by the cheers and shouts of the admiring crowd. As it moved away, a female, who had seem- ingly been waiting to cross the street, fol- lowed the gay pageant with her eyes until they encountered those of one of the fire- men, over whose handsome face a quick glance of recognition passed., For a mo- ment longer she continued to gaze, then, drawing her vail quickly over her face, hur-  riedly pursued her way, and, turning down 1 Bourbon street, walked several squares be-  fore she again paused, in front of a high i brick mansion, dim and discolored with age, t and rang the bell sharply.        a It opened almost immediately, and the f girl ascended several flights of stairs, until % she reached a small room  overlooking the t street. This was her home.. Here she r worked at her art for her daily bread. The v room was scantily furnished, and the smell h of the paints and oils mingled with the un- savory odors which came through two small si windows opening into a damp court on the sl south side.  She was a portrait painter, but O had little opportunity for the display of her sl talent, had  she possessed any. A  few hi miniatures, remarkable more for the accu- au racy of the resemblance than for fine paint- ing, hung on the walls, while one, yet moist re and only half completed, lay on the table. al Several paintings stood on' easels, covered th with cloths to protect them from the dust, in or, perhaps, to hide their defects. A small th writing-desk stood between the windows, ur and one whole side of the room was occu- sil pied by shelves filled with books.    br   i-  The girl had thrown off her bonnet and y cloak, and stood by the table, one hand rest- L- ing upon her cheek. She was small and r- slight. A pale, dark skin, and thick coils 3- of jetty hair hung on her neck. The eyes it were dark and piercing; the lips thin, and r finely cut. Across a low, jutting forehead, e thick, black brows almost met in a straight line. It was not a handsome face, and ex- - pressed intellect rather passive than ener- - getic. Of the moral attributes it unfolded I little. The hands were small, thin, nervous,  and threaded with thick veins. Her dress ' was plain, neat, and dark, and wholly with-  out ornament. She seemed absorbed in some train of thought, which apparently gave her more pain than pleasure, for the brow grew contracted, and the lips more compressed. Whatever the tone of her musing, she gave no utterance to her thought; but seated herself, drew her pallet and brush toward her, and resumed her un- finished work. Hour after hour she labored with 1a rapidity that perhaps accounted for the coarseness of her work. At noon she rose, went into her bedroom, and returning with some cold meat, made a slight and hasty repast. A faint sound, like the boom of cannon, smote her ear; and, springing from her seat, she cried, "Another vessel at the Balize! Oh! if he would only comet    Yet why should I care? The poor artist is beneath his notice. Five long months I have watched and waited for him." She strode rapidly up and down the nar- row room, with an agitation that was piti- able. Twilight was beginning to settle over the city; and up the long streets the quiver- ing lamps shot out their light, and overhead the sky serenely smiled, darker and deeper, until it shone with its glittering network of silvery stars; and then, over spire and roof, broke the broad radiance of a glorious moon.   -Later still, and the noise of human life died away, and the silence deepened, broken only by the cry of the watchman on his beat; and then fell that deep hush that broods over a great city sleeping by night. No chirp of insect here; no cry of some lone bird, to tell us of the night. And still, in her lonely chamber, the young girl walked or leant against the framework of her win- dow, watching the stars overhead, the dark- ness beneath, and hope struggling in her breast. Not until the stars had paled in the cold, gray light of morning did she seek her pillow to sleep heavily. The purple light in the east had passed through every variety of its rapid coloring, and the sun rode high in the heavens, still shining on the dark face which, even in slumber, re- laxed not its anxious, weary look. The lagging hours had worn to noon; and she had waked once more to thought and labor, and worked at her canvas. The un- finished miniature had been put aside, as re- quiring a minuteness of attention which she could not give. Again, through all the noise of that busy life, the signal-gun tells that the vessel has steamed up the river, and reached its port at last. Hle must come now!. The temptation is strong within her to steal down to the wharf and see him there. Yet oh I no; not hmid the crowd must she hear his welcome; the cry of joy from her own lips must not attract the stare of the passer-by. And now, patient heart, the goal is won  A quick, sharp peal rings through the house, a hasty step, and the door is flung wide open. With a short, tremulous cry, she throws herself on his bosom. Ah! woman, for how long shall thy soul dwell in its affections? how long ere the colder hearts of men shall learn that all of life to woman lies in love and hope? Young artist, in the sweet fancies that have sometimes brightened thy. canvas, in the low, gushing tide of happiness to which thy pen has oft given birth, did not this hour live in thy fancy? What were wealth and power and fame to thee, pale child of genius, in thy lonely toil, but for the glori- ous Hope that has lingered at thy side? Question and reply followed in that sweet- est of commune between two whose interests   seemed so nearly linked; and the hours glided rapidly away. The man was the first to recover himself from the idle humor to which he had given an unwonted indulgence, and rose to depart. But this parting was to be so short; he was near her; she could see him now daily. He bent over her with a few brief words of fondness, touched her brow with his lips, and was gone. Years ago, readersf this man, in the first flush of generous youth, had vowed a truer, more passionate love for Rachel Grant- learning, not from cold lips, but from lov- ing eyes that could not repress the glad light of happihess within, that her heart was his. Hearts had become, since then, but toys; yet some of the romance which clings even to hard natures lingered around the name- of that fair image of his boyish love. He felt an attraction greater than the mere love of worldly men for Janet Somers.  Her talents, the -peculiarity of her mind-which was not only of a high order, but of that eccentric caste to which we sarcastically at- tach the epithet of genius-had gradually gained its- ascendency over the gifted but indolent mind of Stanley Powers. Such a feeling must lead to something more than frienidship; and, led on by an interest in her which puzzled no less than piqued his self-love, he became, without any deep feeling-on his side, her lover. Loving deeply and for the first time, with that beautiful candor which belongs to such natures, she had unfolded all the secrets of that wayward heart. No mystery could enshroud a life where every spring of feel- ing and emotion gushed forth under the pressure of a loved hand. Without beauty, with none of the polished ease, the graceful beauty of language, which had characterized Rachel, she had held a sway at which those who knew him best could only marvel. Yet the thought would sometimes -cross him of the impossibility that he could make even her his wife. He was a man who, by force of intellect alone, had won his way into the society in which he now moved. Born of humble parentage, his early youth had received its culture at schools where, amid the stirring rivalries of our newly established aristocracy, the young   &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7518-00000013"/> Stanley had smarted under the lash of schoolboy wit. Often despising the meaner intellect, he yet envied the social station of his tormentors. 'With such gifts as he possessed, he was well aware that, with patience and applica- tion, his future lay in his own hands. Strong control was thus early placed upon strong passions; his talents adapted them- selves readily to the studies which could prove most useful to his manhood; and the ambitious youth became in time the brilliant man of the world. Of the two professions which opened a'field for his ambitious aspi- rations, he chose the bar. The ministry, to which his predilection for the refinements of a literary life, and also his natural indolence, might have led him, was set aside as pre- senting too limited a field, and one whose highest preferments were too slow  of ad- vancement to suit his vaulting ambition. Conscious that his mind lacked that capa- bility of application to minute detail which E makes the astute lawyer, he yet saw, in its c occasional opportunities for 'oratorical elo- X quence, a stepping-stone to that eminence f from which he might aspire to the acme of 1 political ambition.           I To such a temperament the softer allure- s ments of society should have possessed little i attraction; yet, with an inconsistency scarce- r ly to be accounted for, a mind which could i make the higher objects of life only the step- r ping-stones to its own aggrandizement, car- a ried the same desire for preeminence into t the saloon and the drawing-room. Without s means and without friends, he had settled c to his profession in one of the large Western tl cities, and, waiting his opportunity, fortune G favored him; and, in his maiden speech, not o free from the defects of youthful oratory, w the young lawyer succeeded in gaining a fi notice which -soon stamped him as one of si talent and energy.  Perhaps in any other- t than a  Western city his ascent had been t1 slower; but there, where art and   trade pt flourish with mushroom  celerity, Stanley fa Powers glided from  the court-room to the t1 drawing-room,  establishing, by a certain he boldness of address and manner, his entree pi into the fashionable world.       bl Behold, then, the realization of his first fa boyish aspirations. A  few more years of hi   if patient study, and we find him with the ,r means to choose his own field, no common )f reputation as a lawyer and an orator, and fairly launched upon the world as a man of s genius; and, what is a still better stepping- L- stone to political success, a man of the world. i.  His choice now lay between New-York n and the Crescent City, and for once, perhaps - wrongly, he gratified his secret taste for 1 the luxury and refinement of the latter. e Here he had again to train himself anew, t and curb a freedom of manner which checked s the progress his talents might have made - among a people who pride themselves, and justly, upon a refinement of manner to be found in no other city on the Western Con- tinent. Possessing little native refinement, he suc- ceeded, by a ready adaptation to the taste and mind of those around him, in obliterat- ing any unpleasing association which his want of tact had aroused. We find him, after some months residence under a south- ern sun, yielding himself somewhat to his natural indolence, and indulging his taste for literature rather than the law. In a city boasting the finest opera 'and the highest musical talent on the continent, Powers as- siduously cultivated his taste for music, mak- ing himself sufficiently a master of its tech- nicalities to escape the charge of charlatan- ism.  Avoiding any thing more thanlgene- ralities in literature, he readily commanded attention, and, by a rare power of adapta- tion, his conversational abilities were univer- sally conceded to include originality and comprehensiveness.- It was at this time that he first became acquainted with the Grants; and, attracted by the fair loveliness of Rachel, learned, upon closer intimacy, what PhilipnQ er had, that she possessed a fine and cultivated intellect, and warm, sen- sitive feeling. Paying to the isolated; wife -that respectful homage never accorded by the husband, interpreting by a  quick sym- pathy  every shade of feeling on that fair face, what wonder that the gifted stranger, the brilliant conversationalist, won the heart he stooped to win. Learning by the half-sup- pressed tremor in her voice, the almost visi- ble embarrassment of her manner, that her fate, perhaps, depended upon his passion or his generosity, he resolved to forego a plea-   sure that could only mar his prospects. Had Rachel been a widow, with what eagerness he had made her his; but he held his place in society by too slender a tenure to lose all on the cast of a die. And this was in his early manhood, when, if ever, the more ge- nerous emotions of the soul are awakened. No principle of honor withheld the impulse to dally with the heart whose every pulse was true to him, yet truer to all womanly instincts, all wifely honor. Delighting to torture where he found the expression of his passion received with a coldness which piqued his vanity and aroused his ire, he played remorselessly upon her feelings and triumphed in her pain. Yet, even when the knowledge of his worthlessness forced itself upon her, she could love him with all a woman's weakness and a woman's strength. It was under such influences that the pur- pose grew upon her to punish her husband with a truth which he would accept only in its grosser sense, and, .retiring from the world, shut out all happiness from Philip's heart. Cold and stern, paying little regard to the wishes and occupations of his young wife, he had taken her into the world, and then, as if being his wife was sufficient, had s waked to learn that the woman he had  trusted had betrayed him. Terrible must have been the burst of wrath when, even now, its bare memory could so E stir the current of black-and bitter thought. i The wife was spurned from his door, but, 1 too proud to let the world know his shame, I he had hated while he smiled upon the suc- 1 cessful wooer. Dead had that love been in 1 Stanley's heart this many a day, swallowed r up in the stir and din of the world in which N he panted and struggled for name and fame. r He had believed with others the tale of her a death, and, with a sigh to the memory of t his first real passion, had turned resolutely from its influences. .         h Woman the ideal was worthy of his hom- 1 age; woman the real, the actual, he scorn- g fully denied the lowest place in his esteem. s The virtues he lauded lived upon his lips; a the follies he derided lay burled in his heart. t1 If convinced that to marry Janet was to mar s his fortunes, he never dreamed of any other p connection. She was the mistress of his a fancy. The romance of his nature had been- B *A   I won by the eccentricities of 'her character, s and the fascination had grown stronger as a each day wore away. Perhaps, had Janet I proved an exacting mistress, her chains i might have galled the light nature that wore thlem; but her calm, deep affection, given rather to the ideal than the actual man, lay above the storms of petty jealousy; content in his simple avowal of affection, she sighed, nor wished for more. Perhaps her nature found greater happiness in loving than in being loved; perhaps the passion for her'pen raised her into a world of thought above the lower level of human passions: and calmly she could await the hour when she felt he would return to her side, and hear from her lips, not passionate protestations of idolatry, but the outpouring of a spirit that, in its with- drawal from the petty round of social life, had gained, not lost. O artist! O poet! from thy shadowy realms of thought what power was there to chain the worldling's soul to thine? Heart was not there to win, but the spirit was thine to bend, or lead upward with the finer flights of thy woman's fancy; to lull for a few brief moments the unworthy fever of a false ambition. A pang must as- sail his breast when its secrets are laid bare, and shrink from contact with t'le loftier aspirations of thy womanly soul. And it was so. In the brief hours spent at her side the-paltry schemes of life were forgotten, the vain projects of a scheming brain were laid at rest; despising himself while he listened to the hopes- that made labor light, for in the success of that labor lay her hope of happiness.  Upon their marriage she had never touched; perhaps with a half-defined consciousness that his nature was incapable of the sacrifice it in- volved, yet shrinking, with a woman's sensi- tiveness, from putting it to the test. tiie loved no other. 'To her only were his 'secret thoughts, his cherished hopes laid bare.  What greater proof could that great soul need of his truth to her? And she sought none. Rarely were words of affection or endearment exchanged between them; yet, by many a silent token, heart spoke to heart, and soul to soul. He had passed the time when men seek in passion- ate outhreak the expression of emotion. Reason pleaded in vain against his choice,  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7518-00000014"/> and time flowed on, strengthening the hope that the hour might yet come when he could hold out some tangible hope to the brave, unmurmuring spirit. For the pre- sent, such hope were folly to indulge. As the bachelor man of fashion, the man of means, the man of intellect, society courted and flattered; but he held his position on sufferance. Marriage must be used only as a means to strengthen his position; and bitterly as in his heart he might scorn such a policy, he was too much the man of the world not to bow to the force of circum- stance and the age. In person, Powers was 1 tall, with an air of fashionable assurance  which might readily pass for the command i of mind and genius.  His features were l coarse and homely: the mouth large and I somewhat voluptuous, yet expressing firm- s ness of will and self-command in no ordi- 1 nary  degree.  The brow was high and a slightly receding; while, from under jutting c eye-brows,-shone a pair of light gray eyes, w expressing bold and imperious will, quick v though not deep thought, and rare powers p of controlling the minds and hearts of   others. The whole face was characterized byan air of reticence that Idetracted much from an affectation of candor; yet, notwith- standing these defects jarred forcibly upon the beholder at first sight, few long withheld themselves from the fascination exercised by his peculiar intellect, and the charm of a manner which, with every evidence to the contrary, impressed one as genuine, candid, and frank-hearted. The inconsistencies of so marked a character seemed rather to pique the curiosity than to arouse sus- picion; and while with a masterly hand he laid bare the workings of men's minds, his own remained a mystery. And in' that mystery, in the half-revealed glimpses of his aspiring mind, lay the secret of his power over woman. His slightly sneering skepticism was vailed in the chastened language of the polished conversationalist; and who could condemn the polished sar- casm at the sex when the individual woman was made the embodiment of the womanly virtues upon which he delighted to ex- patiate?   CHAPTER VIII. "Non but an author knows an author's cares, Or Fancy's fondness for the child she bears." CowP..   AFTER years of foreign travel, Powers re- turned, to find that Janet, no longer in the flush of girlhood, still held him under an influence stronger than any passing fancy. The beauty that belongs to freshness and youth had faded prematurely from one who could scarcely be said to have known a youth; and there seemed little in the pale, dark- face and slightly stooping form to attract a man of passion and sentiment. We have said that Janet's was an intellect rather passive than energetic. The hours of the day which want compelled her to give to a pursuit which gave her no pleasure proved a powerful drawhack upon the one to which her whole soul was given; and, after a weary day of labor, Janet preferred the indulgence of indolent dreams, of deep and quiet thought, to the details of a work without which all authors' thoughts become powerless to shape themselves from chaos into forms of light and beauty. 'Mechanical labor, dull and uninteresting, -is to the author what plaster and stone are to the architect. Pacing the floor of her quiet chamber, her mind gave itself up to the calm musings of her poet-life; and not from such springs the glittering temple of fame. So months glided into years, and while her- fancies grew slowly amid the smoke and reek of the city, while looking to the quiet stadrs overhead for hope and inspiration, the young authoress learned, with a slight bitterness, that to earn gold with thought was to put from her the finer fancies, and look amid the world around her for the secret sympathies which, to touch the hearts of that throbbing multitude, must bind, with invisible cords, her heart to theirs. And where, in her isolated life, her ignorance of men and things, her involun- tary egotism, where was that link to be, found? Where, Janet? Not till thy heart,   like theirs, has throbbed with the petty griefs and joys that bind poor humanity in the common ties of brotherhood. Pride, and a true love for her pen, still made her cling to hope when the first cruel repulse had wrung her heart. The judgment of the i man of letters had been against her, yet she ! hoped on. I "Young woman," he said, "you have genius undoubtedly; but the successful writer of the age must arouse intellect through feeling, not feeling through intel- lect.' Pride of awakened mind has died into an affectation of sentiment and sensi- bility. Bring me something which, if it be not the genuine ore, shall possess enough of its glitter to attract the reading many. Persons of means only can afford to write as a passion-to follow the dictates of fancy." And Janet had gone back in a proud, de- fiant scorn for the littleness of humanity. But hope was growing dim; and while sometimes a momentary energy guided her i pen, while it scored rapidly, page after page, far into the night, eager to prove his error I to the man of letters, yet gradually she was brought to acquiesce in his judgment. Still she wrote on, impelled by the longings with- in, long after the hope of fame had died out in her breast. With Stanley's return that hope had revived, and life and energy were hers. The interruptions of the day over, I her eager hand guided the fitful pen; rising i sometimes grandly to paintithe passions of Ithe soul-failing utterly to delineate human passions with a human pen. Again she sought the man of letters to hear her sen- tence from his lips; and, with an interest not often vouchsafed by men of his class, he had, while again refusing her manuscript, deigned to advise. -"Live first through the scenes you wish to portray. Learn of life  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7518-00000015"/> without tp paint life within. Mingle in the world, and learn from men, not books, the secret of an author's power." Every habit of her life made her shrink from the trial of her talents in such a school. On their next meeting she questioned Stanley with so keen an interest to draw from him some idea of life and society that he became first aware how barren her existence was of the bright- er and perhaps more wholesome view of life. What she learned through the medium of his highly colored sarcasms on fashionable life again checked her in her half-formed purpose. "Is it from creatures like these," she murmured, "that I am to learn the power of true genius? Ahl no. Behind the glitter of footlights lies not the real life shadowed by the griefs and joys that make our existence all or nothing; but the dreary vacancy of the lumber-room, whose only changes are the shifting scenes of an unreal pageant." Then came that strange purpose in a wo- man's breast to mingle unseen and face to face with that life which was too terribly real to be approached otherwise than with fear. { Poverty and crime lay around her; these surely must be true! There must be power t and pathos among a class whose simple lives- r were an unvarnished picture of nature. And 1 was not nature her mistress? Had she not i vowed truth of heart and pen to her ser- 1 vice? Night after night, when the world of sleep 1 lay around her, she had wrapped herself in s a dark mantle, and stolen forth to look un- E unheeded upon scenes where crime never t slept. - Day after day she had laid aside pal- a let and brush, and shared her scanty purse e to win her way into the sanctuary of the s human heart.   And while her bread fed t them, their lips cheated her with seenling n truth and real lies, and she went from these I lazar-houses of human sin to grasp with skill- 1 ful hand the fierce delineations from artful p yet untutored lips; and they breathed again n upon her paper, elevated, purified, beautiful, tl yet still unsuccessful productions; for the A world in its wisdom knew what her guile- h less spirit knew not-that on its face was tl written a lie!  With perhaps- the bitterest tl tears she had ever shed, Janet sat over the n   e rejected manuscript; and while she poured e with passionate haste from her pen lines t that told in some simple, rhyming verse of ,f her pain, a feeling stronger than curiosity- t was urging the man of letters to seek her. n  But Janet was too much crushed now to f do more than listen with quiet apathy while e he explained the secrets of authorship to - her inexperience, and turned over with the rapidity of a practiced critic the heap of ma- 'nuscripts before him. "Suppose," he said a at length, " suppose you write now   for I bread." Janet shook her head impatiently. ' "You see," he continued, smiling, " it is not  genius and fancy you lack, but homeliness, 1 through whose garb one may yet discern ! poetry. If one is hungry, one is more apt i to think of its pangs as a reality than of the heroism of spirit which could make us for- getful; and so, my dear young friend, until the public has adopted you, consent to leave your pedestal and satisfy its demands. When you have won their hearts, they will- yield some indulgence to the individuality of the author. And, young woman, do not de- spise public opinion because it seems to scorn beauty it can never realize. The low- ering voice which you despise has done too much for our literature to be despised; and, however much we may admire beauty, truth is more to be coveted, and truth is always homely." While he talked on, he had suddenly fixed his eye upon the blotted verses that' Janet still held, and he stretched forth his hand. She yielded it with a slight blush that even to him should the full measure of her dis- appointment be known. But the keen, bright eyes wandered quickly over the page, the silence was unbroken save by the quick rus- tle of the paper, and something in the silence made Janet's heart beat quickly. Soon the large head was raised, the bright, calm eyes looked into hers, and a smile broke from the pleasant lips: "This- will do. It is mine now!"Then rising: "Here you have found the  secret: don't sentimentalize -feel." And he was gone; and Janet was alone with her brimming heart and her secret. And the man of letters was right; for sorrow is the cradle of genius, and suffering its wet. nurse.   CHAPTER IX. "A FORM more active, light, and strong Ne'er shot the ranks of war along; The modest yet the manly mien Might grace the court of maiden queen." SCOTT.   JANET had never bestowed a thought upon her chance recognition among the pro- cession of firemen; and months had passed away, and the streets had grown more quiet under an August sun. The windows of Janet's studio were thrown open, and dust lay thick over the room, floating in with the sultry air and the noxious odors from the street. There was little now to disturb the quiet life of the artist. Sitters were few; and, except the occasional work bestowed on her fancy sketches, her pallet and brush were untouched. Art possessed little attraction for her. She possessed, sufficient skill to derive a slender support; but soul for such work was wanting. She was no artist, and she knew it; her hand lacked the power to de- lineate the mind's conception, and harsh criticism never jarred upon her feelings. She painted for money, she wrote for fame. Her poverty proved no drawhack to her marriage with Powers; it wash name she must win. Profuse in his expenditure of a fortune easily won, he had lavished upon her costly gifts with a delicate regard to her taste and fancy,a delight in thus honoring his mis- tress which removed the weight of any obli- gation. Books which she- needed  were placed silently upon her shelves; not as a loan, for on the fly-leaf was her own name, written in the characters that made them precious. No chance word that could imply a wish, that its gratification did not become his care. Marble busts of those whose genius had fostered her own smiled down upon her, to rebuke, with the calm repose of noble thought, the passionate unrest of toiling am- bition. Her eye could dwell in-that small chamber upon a thousand evidences of a watchfulness, a tender regard, that filled the   dark, thoughtful eyes with tears of tender feeling. Then, turning from forms of beauty to gaze upon her own unlovely face and; form, she would feel a tremor of doubt whether he could love her if youth and beauty became her rival. Such unworthy thoughts, however, rarely troubled her. Her own mind dwelt too often upon the beauty within to be disturbed in its even current by the tortures of a jealous imagina- tion. She had sat idly through the morn- ing before a large picture representing the murder of Holofernes. In the interior of the tent, under royal canopies, lay the sleep- ing victim. The manly form outstretched in the abandonment of deep sleep; the muscu- lar symmetry of the bare limbs; the perfect beauty of the upturned face-from whose sleeping lips seemed to breathe the unhal- lowed passion that struggled against the numbing influence of his deep libations-all were there; while at his side stood the He- brew murderess in all the witchery of her unearthly beauty. The dark, flashing eye, the lofty, upturned brow-throne of noble thought and purpose-were lifelike. Gems sparkled in her hair and on the fair, round- ed bosom, while in her upraised arm she wields the murderous sword. The arm is fair, rounded, slender, yet muscular, and gives you a startling idea of the deadly in- tent with which that weapon is raised. The whole figure is real, lifelike; and you almost expect to see the uplifted weapon descend on the bare, outstretched throat, the spout- ing blood stain the deep crimson of her robe, the look of patriotic devotion change to one of frozen horror at the ghastly spec- tacle of her unwomanly deed. It was the only effort of Janet's pencil worthy of art; and she had jealously guarded it from pro- fane eyes, conscious that here spoke a power that must appall with the vivid portrayal of  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7518-00000016"/> passion; and she shrank, with quick sensi- bility, from such a display. Hours she had sat there, drinking in all the moral beauty of such a sacrifice; feeling all the enthusiasm of a kindred spirit for-her who planned the deed, and nerved the arm, strengthened by thanksgiving at her own escape, to strike. The now unusual peal of the door-bell startles her from her reverie; and, throwing the cloth hastily over the pic- ture, she sinks back on her seat, and listens to the sound of the approaching footstep. It is a young man who enters, with a bright smile on his broad, good-humored face, and an outstretched hand with which he clasps her own. It is a fair type of manly, Saxon beauty; with its fair, ruddy, healthful hue; bright, curling hair, closely cut; frankly smiling,.blue eyes, and pleasant lips, parting over glistening, white teeth. In figure, he was rather below the medium height, broad- shouldered and athletic. He was yet in the prime of early manhood. To vigor of body was united a gay and generous spirit which scorned the affectation and fripperies of the age in which he lived. It was a nature which, in its freshness, might have stepped from a bygone age to 1 gladden us with its beauty. In his laugh, 1 musical in its joyousness, was the ring of i the true metal. And this creature of sun- s shine had come again to woo the artist for  his bride, and, failing that, to give her r something of the delicious brightness that c lingered about his presence. The dark face s and the white robe, how they had lived in r his fancy, while he had sought her every- p where through the crowded streets these p many months in vain.           d But he had found her at last, and with- ti out a word of love had flung himself at her g side, quite happy in the full contentment ii which her presence gave. Without the aid tl of books, with scarcely more than a fund of d practical good sense with which nature had to endowed him, he won her to bend a pleased b attention tohis words. Life, daily, practical al life was his teacher; and love made him n( quick of appreciation. She was glad to see w him again, this boy-lover; though, an hour su before, she had scarcely dreamed of his ex- cc istence. He showed such care for her wel- b fare, such a cordial anxiety for her success in   si- as painter and author, determining wilily, as he gazed upon the poverty of her surround- all ings, that he would bring her the gold with- ig out which genius too often proves a failure. er The boyish freedom with which he com- n, mented on her pale cheek awoke real feel- ,n ing in that lonely heart, so unaccustomed to 3f the accents of affection; and when, reaching 3; out- his hand to the fruit and flowers which c- lay untouched on the table, he broke the is stem off the grapes and put them to her lips, It she eat them, and held out her hand for the it flowers. d  "Never mind the flowers," he said; " they s are of no use." She had grown almost young n in that short hour, and said smilingly, "No, ; unless it be to adorn youth and beauty." "Ah! Janet," he said, "vou need neither to g make you lovely."  She was not pained at e his blunt -compliment; was rather pleased - that he could appreciate her worth behind e so unattractive a mask. He had questioned her closely enough to win some insight into I the barren, comfortless life of the artist, and,- i springing up, cried, "But I forgot, Janet, I have an order here for paintings; show me your best," and, advancing, laid his hand on the cloth that covered her treasure. "Not that, not that," cried Janet quickly, arrest- r ing his outstretched arm; "that is my in. spiration, and alas I Nevil, it is the only one worth buying, yet untold gold would not induce We topart with it. Here is my collection." And she led the way to the other side of the room.  Brent was no artist, and no lover of art; but the group before him presented little attraction even to -his inex- perienced eye; but his note-book was pro- duced, and a careful memorandum made in the most business-like manner. He  was growing restless under the gaze of the search- ing dark eyes bent upon him. Did she guess that one after another her poor, neglected, dust-covered pictures would find their way to a large vacant room adjoining Brent's bachelor apartments,- kept sacred to .them and to his honest love for the artist? But no; in her simplicity and ignorance of all worldly matters, his noble duplicity was not suspected. She had passed on, and was un- covering a small framed picture. Carefully blowing the dust from its surface, and bring- ing it round to the best light, she leans it   against the wall, and steps back a few paces to see if it is in its- best position. It is more carefully executed than most of the others, yet no artist or amateur would have pur- chased it. The young author herself breathes upon the canvas with a truthfulness of re- semblance that seems strange in the por- trayal of her own features. The dark, slight face is raised from the gloom of the sur- rounding room; perfect, too, in every minute detail-to the airy form that bends over her. It is Hope, celestial Hope with the wavy gold of her unbound locks, the glad light in the deep cerulean eyes; while her rosy fin- ger points through the open window up. ward, where, shining dimly, is a single star through gathering clouds in a murky sky. To none but those intimate with the dark struggles of her own wayward spirit could the picture have presented any attraction, or to one who coveted it for the faithful likeness of the author. Brent had been slowly counting out the gold upon a table, with his back turned to Janet and the pic- ture, and so absorbed in the contemplation of the comforts it would bring her as to be almost unmindful of her presence. He knew that, however immaterial the spirit may be, the body is material; and that food and warmth and freedom from the care for daily support, which now harassed her, would make her happier. In that glit- tering heap of yellow gold lay days, ay, months of freedom and liberty. It had seemed to brighten the very dullness of the room; and, turning to summon Janet to re- ceive it, he beheld the picture. But one figure attracted him. The counterpart of his beloved, and with a quick step he stood at her side. Little cared he for sign or sym- bol. Hope had never assumed form of beau. ty or light to him. It had lain deep in his heart, unknown almost to himself; but the room - the portrait - his Janet - his dark- browed love-shone out upon himlfrom the I canvas. "Janet, Janet, I must have it," he cried; "why did you not show it to me sooner?"And he laid his eager hand upon it. "Nay," she answered smilingly, "would I you deprive me of hope? What would this i dingy room be without it?"  Brent was  deeply disappointed. He would have given i untold gold -for that picture; yet he would ]   not press the matter against her wishes. With business-like precision he counted the gold into her outstretched band, formally took a receipt from his pocket-book, which he presented for her signature, putting the pen and ink within reach, and retired to look upon the picture, while she bent, with a slight smile on her lip, to write in bold, clear characters her name at the bottom. It was not her first business transaction: she was quite accustomed to it; and, hand- ing the receipt to Brent, swept the money into a drawer, and locked it. "You will let me come sometimes to look at the picture-at the two pictures," he said, smiling upon her. "Whenever you wish," she answered simply; then, with a sudden impulse, put her hand in his, saying, "God bless you, Nevil! your presence always brings me good in every way." The young man was very reverent, and accepted her words with more feeling than the simple phrase often elicits. On the stairs he encountered Powers. They were total strangers, and each drew aside with a natural curiosity to look upon the other. They stood facing each other perhaps for a short half minute, yet in that time each had instinctively read the other. Some great author has said that " antipa. thies form a natural part of man's instincts, which have become dormant because rarely yielded to." Perhaps this feeling is keener in those whose inferiority of intellect renders them- more alive to the influence of natural emo- tion. However this may be, some such feeling was strongly at work in the breast of Nevil Brent as he gazed into the keen eyes of the dark-browed man .before him. Powers, with his usual quickness, had read at a glance the handsome face and artless nature of the youth, and, returning his cold gaze with one in kind, the two went their way. Brent to dive into alleys and courts, seeking to persuade all the world to have their beauties or imperfections transferred to canvas, perhaps with a half conscious- ness that the stylish inmates of fashionable dwellings would scorn the meaner labor of his mistress. Powers to saunter into Ja- net's studio, a smile curling his lip at the  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7518-00000017"/> consciousness of his own superiority in the conflict which he felt was at issue-between mind, as embodied in himself, and matter, as embodied in the athletic frame and iron nerve of his .rival. He asked no questions of Janet. What matter to him if twenty such swains sighed for his mistress? He had a lordly con- sciousness of his own superiority to the idlers that sometimes found their way to the artist's studio. True, he was not handsome, and Brent was, but Janet's was no heart to be won by a straight nose and glistening teeth. Powers had a most sovereign contempt for mere goodness-innate morality. His experience of the world had shown him how unequal the contest between the unlettered man of worth and the man of genius. He smiled when Janet revealed the morn- ing's work. He saw through the flimsy vail which covered Brent's artifice, with a slight contempt for one who could give gold yet not receive its fruits-in the works of real genius.   He would have given the half of his for- tune for some gem which men of taste would covet, but he had an undisguised contempt for Janet's attempts at art Her portraits were valuable for their strict resemblance to the originals, her fancy sketches worthless. It is to be remembered that he had never seen the one effort of her pencil which de- served the name of art-the one picture into which had leaped the soul of self-immolation. He did not reveal Brent's secret to her. He admired as a master-piece of the Great Art- ist this striking picture of the unsuspecting simplicity of the child united to the lofty genius of the woman and the poet. Her pride was secure in such ignorance, and he had no interest in Brent that he should tell him that the pictures for which he paid such a price were fit only for the lumber-room. He fully appreciated the magnanimity with which it was possible Brent had acted. The poetry of his own nature could enter into all the possibilities of such self-sacrificing devotion while he remained incapable of the deed.   CHAPTER X. cL ALL that Imagination's power could trace Breathed in the pencil's imitative grace; O'er all the canvas, form, and soul, and feeling, That wondrous art infused with power of life."   To the stranger visiting New-Orleans, our beloved city presents an attraction unac- countable to those unacquainted with its peculiar associations. For here no impos- ing public buildings frown upon the curious gaze, nor here do we find wide-spreading parks, in which art aids nature to allure the eye. Few are the gems of art which adorn our Southern metropolis. The lower city seems sturdily to have resisted the gigantic strides of " progressive improvement" which have taken such firm hold of the American mind. It clings jealously to every association of its past history; and while the new town smiles in all the attractive glitter of modern improvement, the old city retains its an- cient, smoke-begrimed dwellings; its narrow, rough-paved, dirty streets; its foreign air, in- separable from the sight of its quaint archi- tecture; its varied population of French, Spanish, Dutch, and Creole or native. Here, mostly in the larger thoroughfares, with their strange contrast of evergreen foliage and time-stained roofs, are gathered the descendants of the ancient French' and Spanish nobility, and the no less proud race of ancient Creole families, jealously guarding their individuality amid the parvenu wealth and fashionable aristocracy of the more re- cent tide of American emigration. Nothing can be more apparent to a Euro- pean who visits New-Orleans than the dis- tinctive characteristics between these two races of American people; many of them born and reared within the precincts of the city, living separated only by the great tho- roughfare, Canal street, yet widely differing in habit, appearance, and manner, and gene- rally exhibiting a strong repugnance to in- termingling. There are few buildings which present any interest beyond the historical association which tradition has woven with   every romance of the Crescent City, for, alas the marble courts, the Moorish pal- aces, the orange groves, with which romance writers have sought to lessen- the real his- toric interests of our noble city, have exist- ed only in the imagination of the writers, and have blended its incidents with the ridi- cule which must attach to such exaggerated pictures, and to which a real knowledge of the location and appearance of the city would give the lie. The most prominent object of interest is the old cathedral, venerable from its age and the memories which cling around this silent witness of the changes and chances which it has outlived. In the lower or French part of the town are contained the old and new opera-houses, the cathedral, the mint, the court buildings, which are of Moorish architecture, with miniature domes and broad, flat windows; the celebrated French market, certainly de- serving a separate description, and which presents a scene of continued and never- failing interest. The market buildings and their surroundings present one of the most attractive features of the city. Here are gathered together the representatives of all nations, enlivening the scene with their re- spective jargons, from the guttural German, presiding over his meat-stall, to the musical Italian, who tempts you with a display of foreign trinkets; from the Sicilian nut- vender to the Spaniard, who artistically mosaics his tables and counters with the luscious fruit of the Cuban Isle. Books, papers, musical instruments, and fancy wares are gayly arrayed under the fantastic bazaars that spread on either end of the long market-house. This is a long, low building, supported by square brick pillars, and con- taining several rows of stalls, some with marble tops .and overhung with mirrors, at  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7518-00000018"/> which may be obtained hot beverages, meat of all kinds, and game. Passing through this, we come upon the booths of the Jew merchants, who cry their wares of pins, buttons, combs, and other trinkets, and whose stalls are gayly decorated with flags and present a most picturesque appearance. Next we come to a smaller building, where are sold vegetables and fruits.: And still further down we find the fish market. The two last are miniatures of the large market, and give a uniform appearance to this wide- ly known locality. On the outskirts of the city is the Ursu. line convent, a stately pile of conventual buildings. Leaving the dark, narrow streets of the old town, you emerge upon the busy thoroughfare, Canal street-the Broadway of New-Orleans, yet presenting to Southern eyes greater attraction in its airy, well-light- ed shops, arranged with that artistic effect in which the French and Creole excel. All above Canal street tells of the more stirring life of the American population. Broad, smooth-paved streets, large, light, yet hand- some dwellings, newly inclosed squares, and numerous public buildings meet the eye. Further up, and the luxurious taste of the wealthy Southerner revels in gardens where the magnolia and the myrtle, indeed, mingle their breath with the balmy breezes of our sunny land; where, over closely shaven lawns of emerald green, play the cool wa-  ters of some leaping fountain, and roses and c mignonnette, with the mingled breath of a many garden blossoms, are borne through r the'open windows of some low-roofed villa, z with wide-spreading balconies, throughout i whose simple interior reigns the elegant re- I finement characteristic of our people. Here i is no picture of romantic fancy, but a sim- 1 ple description of what may greet the eye in y La Fayette, Jefferson, and Carrollton., In t the latte'r are the Oarrollton Gardens-an E object o0 interest even in our land of flow- j 4X.  The magnolia, so peculiarly a Southern c flower, forms  the chief ornament of our s grounds in country and city, and numberless are the traditions which have endeared it to " Louisianians. In this more attractive part a of the town Hillory Grey had fixed his resi- n dence; in a handsome villa, with wide balco- h   it nies, in front of which stretched a smooth, h green lawn, dotted with shrubberies, minia- w ture fountains, which poured their waters s, over the sward in purling, musical streams, d with here and there the white gleam of a sta- ,s tue, the picturesque grouping of which gave a. evidence of artistic skill and taste. It was e such a home as Grey had loved to picture; "and in Elinor every wish of his heart, every e dream   of happiness, had been fulfilled. ;, True type of the noble Southern matron, - my pen lingers with the vain hope to pic- ture thee. Let it pass. Let the part she - bears in the tale unfold the beauties of I character which made her lovely in the eyes s ,of her husband-lovely to those who had r felt the magic of her earnest truth, the elo- r quent worth that spoke from her dark, bright i eyes. Raised by no single virtue above the - sweet sympathy of a Christian woman with t the frailties of others, her power over them [ was greater than mere mind could give. Her figure was slight and girlish, the eyes dark and brilliant, and rendered the face singularly attractive if not handsome. Her defects were such as belong to a warm heart and generous temper.  Grey, ike others, had never dwelt upon Elinor's age in his choice of a wife. Such youth as quick im- pulses and a lively sensibility give to wo- man, long after youth has really fled, were hers. Could Judith have looked in upon the party gathered upon the lawn at the close of a long summer day, she would hardly, a second time, have mistaken the wife. "Eli- nor leant upon her husband's arm; her delicate, .oval- face was raised to meet his fond eyes, which, moist with deep feeling, rested upon her. ; Whatever the subject which engrossed them, it was one which had stirred deeply sweet fountains in the young husband's heart. Further on strolled the fair, young girl whose beauty had sent such a pang to Judith's breast; yet, had not jealousy blinded hetr, she might have traced on that downcast face the sisterly likeness she bore to Hillory.        / Isabel Grey was of that singular witching loveliness which we insensibly connect with a sentiment of its perishability. Health mantled in the rich yet delicate bloom on her cheek; shone in the look, half shy, half   mirthful, of the violet eyes, over which the long, silken lashes swept; while the pure, white brow shone under a cluster of rich, golden curls. The mouth was singularly sweet and childish; the neck slender, white, and arched; while the form, slight yet rounded, seemed rather to float than move, so graceful were her movements. It was a beauty, so marvelous in artistic delineation, that the eye might rest unwearied upon it; yet it was a beauty that saddened the heart while it pleased the senses. Some such thought may have been in Brent's mind while he paused for a moment to watch, un- seen, the sweet picture. She came slowly forward, gathering occasionally the flowers that grew invitingly within reach. Brent had, perhaps, less admiration for female i-loveliness than is usual to men, yet he was not wholly insensible to the winning smile that lighted Isabel's face on beholding him; and he lingered at her side for some mo. ments before seeking Elinor. Perhaps to Brent, more than to any other  friend, the Greys expressed the warm at- i tachment which his manliness, his honest worth, had gained. In every other instance, Elinor had insensibly inclined to those more I lavishy gifted 'by nature with the higher c endowments of intellect; but there was that 1 in the character of Nevil which interested 1 and puzzled. She, perhaps, alone read the p workings of a nature which, under a mask r of indifferent, commonplace calmness and v self-control, possessed quick sensibilities, strong passions, and strong principles. To r the depths of that strange nature, in all its v inconsistencies, even she had never pene- r trated; and perhaps Brent was himself in u equal ignorance., As yet life had flowed in h one smooth, unbroken ripple-its deeper M current scarcely stirred by his love for Ja- E net; for, though he perhaps felt its hope- h lessness, yet, while he might seek her un- g bidden, heap upon her every attention which a, love could devise--and this was a privilege f( which he soon saw was accorded only to h him-he was happy. Nothing had occurred ar to arouse his jealousy or to arake suspi- co cion; for, beyond his chance encounter on 15 the stairs with Powers, he had seen nothing E to make him suspect the existence of a rival. n And now, full of Janet and her lonely life, so   e he had sought Elinor with the purpose of , bringing them together if possible. Feeling , all that the friendship of such a woman r would be to the artist, he related, in a few , words, all he knew of Janet's history, told t in simple, manly words his own passion, and , begged Elinor, for his sake, to seek the art- t ist in her studio, and fqrm an acquaintance, which, once begun, he felt would soon ripen into a warm and lasting friendship, and would, by giving to the artist the womanly companionship -for which every life grew brighter, bring her nearer to himself by the ties of human emotions. Elinor had listened attentively; and while Brent enlarged upon his theme, her quicker fancy had strayed to the dingy room, the dark-eyed artist, the struggling genius, earn- ing, by the drudgery of an uncongenial oc- cupation, the means to power and fame. The picture, as drawn by her fancy, was highly colored, and more in accordance with her own romantic imagination than with the sober detail of facts which Brent was relat- ing. The artist was a young girl-dark, perhaps not beautiful, yet certainly attrac- tive. The possibility that the unromantic, prosaic Brent could fall in love with an el- derly, dark woman, never presented itself to her for a moment. It belonged neither to his years nor to his nature; and when he paused for her reply, she eagerly gave the required promise that she would do all he wished-all that lay in her power. Brent knew that no injunctions were needed-no warnings against the danger which might arise from Janet's shrinking reserve. Elinor would manage all with her usual tact and delicacy; and he bade her a hearty good-by, and. stepping through the window, went rapidly back to the city. Elinor stood looking musingly after him. A happy wife herself, she could conceive of no. greater joy than that of wedded intercourse, and had blushed consciously an hour be- fore when Grey, following the direction of her eye as it rested upon Brent and Isabel, and reading her thoughts in her speaking countenance, upon which he looked so fond- ly, had exclaimed: "Match-making again, Elinor!"Yes, she had quite made up her mind that the two bright natures should some day awake to the secret of their own  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7518-00000019"/> happiness. Who could look upon Isabel- sweet picture of girlish innocence and pu- rity-and not love her? And with quick, womanly sympathy, she had divined what, perhaps, the reader has not, that in that fresh, young heart was aroused the first tremulous breath of womanly tenderness, speaking as yet only in the softening of the eye and the flush that passed over her cheek in his presence. Elinor had silently watched its growth, rejoicing in the destined fulfillment of her cherished plan; and now, in a few words, Brent had shown her his entire ignorance of what perhaps a vainer man would long since have divined; shown her, too, the im- possibility of his loving Isabel. With a feeling of pain, she saw the necessity of speedily arousing the young girl from her dream, putting before her the -true state of the case; and it Was to devise some means of bringing this about as gently as possible that she now remained in earnest thought.   rWith her usual candor, she made no con- cealment to her husband of the discovery she had made, and of her wishes for their fulfillment; and now, how was she to tell him that that love was hopeless? Yet she relied too much on her husband in every thing to hesitate, and skillfully she framed her communication, so that interest in the strange tale quite absorbed him. He had smilingly listened to her einthusi- astic repetition of Brent's story, and allowed her to indulge her fancy in this as in every other instance. She knew that to her be. longed the task of undeceiving Isabel; and perhaps the best method was -first to make her acquainted with the artist. The true state of affairs could not long remain a se- cret then, and her delicacy would be spared. Elinor was under the impression that the affection of Brent for the artist was a de- clared and mutual thing; and, under this false impression, her first visit to the studio was made.   CHAPTER XI. "Tw look and tone Of witchery are nature's own; Like light from heaven, thy magic glance; Thy voice, the harp's wild utterance, When, touched at eve by some spirit's band, It breathes the notes of the better land." S. P. CHeE%.   GRADUALLY Janet had warmed into some- thing approaching to natural life, under the influence which Brent was gaining over her; bringing to bear upon her colder, more apa- thetic nature all the generous warmth, the sunny radiance of his own more hopeful one. It seemed as if that golden shower he had poured into her lap had crept stealthily through the gloom of her studio, and lent a brightness foreign to its usual appearance. Among the bronzes, the coldly gleaming marble, fresh, beautiful flowers had made their way. On the once bare table in the centre of the room were heaped baskets of luscious fruit, and ruby wine and amber sherry gleamed richly through Bohemian glass flasks and dainty, crystal goblets, while on the deep crimson cushions of a luxurious arm-chair reposed the form of the authoress. Hope seemed to have stepped from her canvas to light the darkly gleaming eyes, while through the purple veins a warmth, borrowed from the wine-cup, showed faintly on her swarthy cheek. The thin lips were scarlet, and curved into an expression of quiet contentment that breathed through the whole attitude. Her room was still carpetless and curtain- less, yet the look of cheerless poverty had disappeared. With the warm, rich sunlight streaming through the half-open windows, and flickering over the purple-black, heavy- sweeping locks, Janet formed no unmeet re- presentation of the presiding genius of that dark abode. Elinor, with a quick, comprehensive glance, had taken in all this, and now paused, reluc- tant to break upon the pleasant reverie that had parted-her lips in a half smile, but which   speedily disappeared as Janet rose, and, with. her usual shy and somewhat awkward man, ner, offered her a seat. No idea that other than business brought them entered her mind, as she glanced at the cards in her hand, or her manner might have been less. cold and business-like. She glanced from. one to the other, to determine which was to. be her sitter. Isabel, looking less attractive than usual' in her street dress and bonnet, sat looking about her, with some curiosity, upon the: abode of the artist. The impression upon her mind was that which evidences of po- verty and discomfort bring to the young;. and, after a slight glance at the marble! busts-the works of art frowning grimly upon her-she sank back with the mental ejaculation, il How cheerless!" To Elinor every evidence of poverty spoke. strongly of the solitary struggle, the womanly heroism of the being before her, who had sat so serenely musing in a world of her own, un- touched by the lowering details of her daily surroundings} when they had broken upon, her reverie. In a manner that was far from business-- like, she stated that Mr. Grey wished a half- length portrait of his sister; and she indi-- cated Isabel. There was that in her magical tones that. made Janet take a second look at the face that had at first scarcely attracted her notice, while she had scanned, with the minute scru- tiny of an artist, the beautiful face of Isabel.. Won by the unconscious sympathy which. often governs the simple actions of our daily- intercourse, she had said, while a slight smile: transformed her cold, wintry, dark face: "I am but a poor artist, madam; and  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7518-00000020"/> such a face deserves the honor of a better pencil. My paintings arenacoarse, though faithful likenesses. I might hope to do jus- tice in a miniature. But take my advice, strange though it may sound from my lips, and seek some artist whose greater celebrity has been justly won." Isabel raised her blue eyes to Janet's face; and then, touched no less'by her candor than by the flattery so sweet to her young years, she cried: "Ah I but you will- paint my likeness, in any way you like. You know best about these things; and I am sure Hillory will be pleased." Elinor, much pleased that Janet haa im- 'pressed Isabel so pleasantly, signified her -consent. And Janet, having removed the light hat and mantle, gazed long and ear. nestly into that sweet, infantile face, until :her own -grew serious with an undefined feeling of sadness, which ever crept into the heart of one who looked upon its beauty. 'The golden hair, slightly but most pictur  esquely disarranged, rippled back from the 1 clear'brow; and when she raised her long lashes and gazed, with herviolet-tinted eyes, f :into Janet's own, she felt an almost irre. sistible -impulse to, fold her to her breast, r :and kiss the sweet lips and beautiful brow. i Could she realize then all the hopeless mis- s - ery that lovely stranger would one day bring t to her already desolate life?-misery deeper, 'more silently and bravely borne than the I :sharp pang which had come to Judith when, gazing upon it, she had mistaken- it for Hil- M lory Grey's wife.            N Touching the fair, curling hair with her M  dark, slender fingers, Janet took from a vase a  half-opened bud of the moss-rose, with tl creamy  petals and opal-tinted heart, and ;fastened it on her bosom. Retiring to her it , table, she get silently to work, determined J to portray, with all the artistic skill and in :grace of which she was mistress, the sweet to Ate before her. Elinor, fatigued with sit- ting, at length rose and strolled to the book- o] i shelves, opening and glancing through the n ' well chosen selection with evident pleasure. w Janet had become too much absorbed in her cl ' work to notice that the door had been quietly y openbd, and Stanley Powers stood at the threshold, glancing his keen eyes from one Ja   or to another of the group before him. Elinor h turned, and, with a bright smile and extend- s- ed hand, came forward, exclaiming: e,  "Mr. Powers! When did you return?" i,  His countenance expressed no less plea- y sure than her own at the encounter, as he replied: ; "Nearly six months ago:. long enough to r have enjoyed much of your society, had I g known of your vicinity. Where are you staying, and what has induced you to re- i main in the city through this long, hot sum- t mer?" "I am living in La Fayette, Apollo street. Here is my card." He glanced at the card. "Elinor Grey?" r Still he did not comprehend. Elinor, slight- ; ly- blushing, said: I "I am married, Mr. Powers. You must Iremember Mr. Grey." Yes, he remembered him.   It was quite plain now. Elinor had married this young man whom Powers had sneeringly termed once, in her presence, "a  crack-brained philanthropist." What other term  could he apply to one who forswore the vices and frivolities of the age, boldly acknowledged his Master before men, and, unshaken by ridicule or sarcasm, spent his leisure hours in giving  instruction and assistance to swarms of ragged newsboys and appren- tices? A pause of embarrassment ensued, which Elinor relieved by saying, in a low tone:, "I hope, for the sake of old acquaintance, we shall see something of you, Mr. Powers. You will learn to like my husband, as all do who know his worth." "I am   sure of it. Your choice has set the seal of approbation," he said brightly. The conversation had proceeded without interruption; and now Powers, seeing that Janet had suspended her work and was look. ing inquiringly at him, said, with an admoni- tory glance: "Miss Somers, I am glad you have this opportunity of making such friends; and I make bold to believe Mrs. Grey will riot withhold the title when she learns that I lay claim to your acquaintance, and, I may hope, your friendship also." His tone and manner were formal; and Janet, after the first momentary feeling- of   surprise, slightly bent her head and resumed her labor. It was evident that he wished, for some reason, to conceal their relations from these people; and Janet unquestion- ingly acquiesced in this, as in every other wish of his, spoken or implied. What were these people or their opinions to her? Yet, if he valued them, she would gratify him by endeavoring to interest her- self in them. Powers had not been so busily engaged with Elinor but that his eagle eye had wandered to the extreme beauty of Isabel's face; and now, with his usual assurance, he had included her in his an- nouncement, and followed it up by direct- ing his conversation occasionally to her. Elinor, with a slight tincture of haughty reserve, had resented his effrontery by formally presenting him to Miss Grey. There was something in the pure outline of the delicate, fair face, the finely moulded lips and chin, that brought to his mind the long silent memories of Rachel Grant. Ab- sorbed gradually in admiration of' this his favorite style of beauty, he had ceased speaking, and, quite unmindful of Elinor's presence, or that of the dark-browed woman he had come to seek, he had- stood at Janet's side, watching with intense interest every stroke of her pencil, glancing thence to trace adlikeness to the fair face of his boyish love. i Strange that at this distant day the power- I ful passion that had first warmed him into i manhood should be so vividly recalled. ] Amid such foreign associations, too; for, in ( the calm eyes of Elinor, the violet orbs of  Isabel, or the dark brow and jetty hair of c the Pampinea of his later dreams, there was surely little to bring from the dead E past the long forgotten face, so palely beau- c tiful, the soft, clear, brown eyes and sweep- E ing lashes of Rachel Grant. Little, too, in t the bare and chill room in which he now ( stood to recall the scenes where, amid lux- r drious elegance, he had whispered, rather 1 to his own heart than to her, of love. Yet 1 now, with the golden gleam of Isabel's hair, t out of which her white, shadowy brow   I shone-with the restraining presence of e Elinor, and, with " that dark woman watch- c ing him," it were wonder that he L" slept and s dreamed;" yet so it was; and the minutes a flew by, and the bronze clock on the mantle c   told that an hour had passed, when he woke from his absorption, as Janet abruptly rose, put up her brushes, and announced that the sitting was over. Elinor had watched his absorption, his evident admiration of Isabel, and, ignorant of his former history, or the origin of the slight sigh that had escaped his lips, had been busily weaving a romance while she tied on her bonnet, in which this man of genius-this worldling--for she knew himl well-would seek and find rest and content- ment, perhaps happiness, with her sweet sister; while Brent laid his sunny heart at the feet of Janet Somers. She had always imagined that some time in the life of Powers had found him the passionate wooer of some cold and stately mistress; and that he had, in putting away this love, learned the idle trifling that bent his knee at every shrine of womanly beauty t No suspicion that Janet Somers had at length charmed his erratic fancy crossed her mind, for how seldom does genius wed its mate! And Powers! It had grown quite late. The carriages rolled through the streets, bearing their fair burdens toward the smooth shell-road, in their evening drives to the lake shore.  The western sun, brilliant now without warmth, sank down amid pur- ple evening clouds, throwing his last part- ing radiance into Janet's dull studio; and Powers still sat in Janet's crimson chair, in deep and silent thought, moody - and ab- stracted. Janet had noiselessly removed every trace of her labor, wheeled away her table, and, drawing a low stool foward, seated herself at his feet. This was to be one f her idle evenings: the hours that stood out like golden gleams from the soli- tude of her laborious life. Idleness, how, delicious, with the presence that made mere existence a happiness!-sometimes listening to words which stirred the bub- bling fountains of happiness in her heart through the long hours of his absence. What.-to her was the week of labor, when she could look forward to that one evening of rest and contentment? Content so deep, so full, that it wrote sweet, peaceful lines about the mouth, and relaxed the furrows on her swarthy brow.  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7518-00000021"/> To-night, she had sat at 1i feet; leaning her arm on his knee; looking with her dark, searching eyes into his; waiting patiently until the mood had passed off, which she saw had led his thoughts away from her into that past in which she held no part. She neither moved nor spoke; for was it not happiness enough to look into that dear face; to follow, by a secret sympathy, the work- ings of his mind? And this, she felt exult- ingly, this made him hers, not beauty nor youth, which had palled so often; and her hold was the surer. The patient gentleness with which she ever awaited his pleasure was ever surely rewarded; and how very -dear she had become to him I No exacting mistress could have bound him in so sweet a thraldom.  And now, when twilight has robbed her cheek of its faint bloom- when her lips are becoming compressed, and she moves slightly from her painful position, but very slightly, and without a wish to disturb him, he rouses up, and says, "Janet, you must touch more lightly the lines about the mouth and brow; a heavy hand would mar such spiritual loveli- ness ;" this, then, was what she had waited so patiently for I Yet she was not much moved.  It was not the first time that youth and beauty had come between her love and him: and she had conquered; ay, and would again. She rose, and, with a quick, irregular step, passed to the mantel, took thence a taper, and lighted a heavy antique bronze lamp. The clear, mellow light streamed out over the room, and cast fantastic shadows over the walls. She went to the table, raised the flask of wine, and poured a rich, gene- rous stream into the goblet. "See, Stanley, this has been the wine of life to me; for it Ihs brought a warmth and glow to cheek and heart,- and lifted me out of -this dark roomn into fairied splendor: taste, and say if it is good." And she put the wine to his lips. He had scarcely noticed her before; but now he saw that it was -true: that bodily comfort had brought a healthful glow, that   was almost youth, to the eye and cheek of his mistress. In- her white, flowing robe; with her dark, rich hair, which she had play. fully unbound, coiling about her; her loose sleeve falling back, and disclosing an arm round, slender, graceful, yet muscular, the prototype of that in the picture of Judith; with the lamplight falling full on her dark face, she seemed, to Powers's aroused imagi- nation, some wild Bacchante with her Cir- cean goblet. He woke, to .catch the inspiration of her mood, and listened while, half kneeling again at his side, with his hand wound in her heavy locks, she poured forth all the witching sor- cery of her strange mind in jest, in song, in highly wrought mental pictures, which led him far away from the sweet and fair images which had claimed him but a few moments before. It was witchcraft, magic, one might almost believe: and when she passed from this into a quieter channel of deeper thought and feeling, touching sometimes, with ten- der pathos, upon the holier passions of her womanly heart, she knew instinctively that he was hers once more; Ithat the truer and better side of his naturet had responded to her own; and when hours had rolled on', and he had, with a quiet, silent pressure of his lips upon her brow, left her once more alone, she knew that her image alone filled his fickle heart; her influence led him through the thronging streets without a pause, through scenes of temptation to a quiet pillow, with pure and peaceful thoughts, to dream of her. The wine-cup and the dice- box were powerless for a few brief moments. Powers was too gentlemanly to indulge to any extent in debasing vices, yet he was none the less a votary of the elegant shrines where, in luxurious clubs, or the private parlors of gentlemanly gamesters, vicel holds her, aristocratic revels. And Janet, with a contented assurance that he was at!home with his own thoughts, extinguished her lamp and knelt thankfully to God for the power he had given her over one humani heart that was all of life to her, and so slept.   CHAPTER XII. "'TWAS thy high purity of soul, Thy thought-revealing eye,     V That placed me spell-bound at your feet." CLAR.   STANLEY was too much occupied with legal business for some days to return to the stu- dio, and meantime the miniature was nearly i completed; would have been quite so, but Janet delayed it in order that he might in- spect it. She had striven to render on that bit of ivory all the ideal grace of the lovely prototype, and had succeeded marvelously well. The painting was delicate and finely toned, while in the golden hair, the sunny eyes, and pure outline of the lips Isabel lived again. And this gem of beauty she was reserving for Stanley's inspection. With a strange pleasure Janet had wrought out the lines of beauty on that young face, with no unworthy jealousy of its extreme fairness. She had drunk too deeply of the inspiration of the lofty genius who had been the guardian-spirit of her poet-life, to suffer a thought unworthy of herself and her calling to intrude. Yes; she had stood looking upon the grand beauty of Goethe's marble face, looked upon the calm majesty of the brow, the passionless curving of the lips, until it spake in almost living ac- cents from those dumb lips of the noble sa- crifice, the living death, that had made his renown. In the prime of his manhood he had put away the passion and sentiment of his being with the mistress who had usurped the throne once given to'his genius. And then, in the height of her beauty and his passion, with the power to choose his own, he had, looking sternly' upon her seductions and his own barren future, discarded the woman of his fancy, and, in the misery of -a life destitute of sympathy, given heart and soul, to the great work before him. And surely he had reaped all of happiness an author's life can give. If his ambition, his life, had been a failure, then all human labor must be vain. But could she doubt that that sacrifice of   blood and tears- had been a triumph? Were the eyes and lips of that dumb marble mute? Oh I no, not to her; not to her, his- child and pupil. She had drawn every inspiration of her life from the grandeur of that passion- less face; from the more stirring breath, too, of the fame he had carved out relentlessly from the altar of self-immolation. Could she not humbly imitate her master? After days of silent communion, Janet believed that, when the love that made life sweet to her was withdrawn, she could bear it; but to put it willfully from her-ah! of that she was incapable. Neither did she believe that such stern trials of our nature are required. Ambition, that loftiest passion of the hu- man soul, may sometimes require that it di- vest itself of earthly passions before it achieve a worthy success; but in her own case there was little incentive. If her fate was forced upon her, she would accept it. The spirit within her had glowed at-the re-- cital of tales where mortality had almost been forgotten in the enthusiasm of the victim. The spirit of the daughter of Jephthah, the in- tended martyrdom of Judith, the sacrifice of Iphigenia, had warmed her own spirit to nerve itself to such a conflict, should the trial come. Books of heathen rites, the Dru- idical sacrifices, and the more sublime mar. tyrdoms of the Christian faith, as given from the Bible, had formed and moulded her mind to an exalted enthusiasm which, standing now before her canvas, she felt would not fail her. Powers had come in, and stood looking over her shoulder at the marvelous power that breathed from her canvas in the uplift- ed face of the Jewish matron, from whose stern lips spoke the mingling of passion- ate pleading, mute thanksgiving. He was startled, awed almost, for in that dark, Jew-  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7518-00000022"/> ish face, beautiful and haughty though it was, he saw, not the daughter of Simeon, but his own swarthy-browed mistress. Silently Janet allowed him to gaze on this vivid portrayal of her silent yet passionate nature. She read in the quick flash of his eye that he understood her, and in the glance of passionate admiration he turned-upon her she readc anew the triumph her nature, strong in its self-control, had won over him. ' Janet Janet!" he said, "what power is yours! Is it not worth all that mere beauty ever won I You bind me, body and soul, to you with the mighty witchery of mind, and may well smile at the lesser temp- tations which only assail me for a mb- ment." "More, far more," she whispered, " when such power gives me the only heart I care to win. Powers, it is in such moments of weak faith in you that I feel myself unworthy of you; but how can I look upon my own im-' age, and feel safe? You, like me, can wor- ship beauty, and do not despise me that I sometimes fear it. A sense of extreme home- liness comes painfully sometimes to my heart, to be forgotten in the remembrance of your generous love." "Extreme homeliness I With these won- derful eyes, as magnificently brilliant as some wintry, star-gemmed night I   With this mass of shining, jetty locks, that -might have formed a head-piece for Eve!" She smiled when he ceased, and, drawing her caressingly to him, pressed his lips to her cheek, brow, and lips. It was rarely that he caressed her otherwise than by a kiss on her brow, and now she knew that it was no physical attraction that awakened 4 his tenderness. "No, no, Janet; I love you neither for youth nor beauty, but far, far better than ' I ever loved either or both.  Women have i formed but a small part of my happiness, ] and the hours of fitful trifling. I have be- I stowed upon them have left me more your 1 slave than ever. Yes; this dark, unlovely i face has stood beside me in every temptation i of later life; has mingled in every dream of 1 a nobler ambition to which your influence i has aroused my sluggish nature. In every E hope of future happiness it has lured me on ] to forget myself and my own future, except I   t as bound with yours. Is not such a love ; worthy your acceptance?" Ah! was it not?  Did not the darkly bright eyes answer him?  The sweetly smiling repose ofithe curved lips speak more 3eloquently than words V And when he had ' asked for the miniature, and praising the ex- rtreme delicacy of the work, worthy, he add- ed, smiling upon her, of the beautiful face, and offered to deliver it, she saw him'depart without a feeling of jealousy or distrust, then stood with brimming heart and glisten- ing eyes before her master, whispering:- "O my master I Is n6t such love worth more to poor humanity than an empty name?"  Yes; she dared now, in her de- lirium of joy, to stand there and say so, and without feeling that the calm eyes, in their far-off serenity, whispered rebuke. And had such love been hers, she might truly have mocked at fame; but love, such love as her ' pure, womanly soul craved, such love as she was lavishing upon an ideal, was denied her. In her calmer hours she felt how far from worthy Powers was of her deep, impassion- ed worship, yet loved on, be'cause it would have been death to part with him. There are some natures more fitted to lavish affec- tion on others than to receive it, to whom it is greater happiness to love than to be loved, and such a nature was Janet's. While she clung with a tenacity, which in a less lofty character would have been humiliating, to the careless homage of Stanley Powers; liv- ing upon sweet recollections of endearments rarely bestowed, while he paid that homage rather to her intellect than to herself; 'Brent was lavishing upon her the warmest affection of his manly heart-a love given to the wo- man, not the genius; and where lives the woman to whom this is not a dearer regard? To a man, the proud homage which the world yields to mind may be happiness--all perhaps which his nature demands; but there are moments in the life of woman, even when she has gained the summit of power, when human aspirations can soar no higher, when the breath of adulation is wrung from the reluctant lips of millions, that she turns with a sad feeling of disappointment, con- scious that this is not happiness; that the power so eagerly sought for, the fame for which she panted, has only been gained at /   the expense of all those lesser delights which sum up our womanly existence. Each step has widened the breach that has severed her from sympathy with her kind. A sympathy which we can not scorn, be- cause, while we proudly deny, the bitterness   of disappointment proclaims its potency. The ofttimes undefined craving for sympa- thy with our kind is the bond through which God has proclaimed our brotherhood-; and we become wiser and better for this compul. sory dependence on one another.  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7518-00000023"/>  CHAPTER XIIL "So farewell hope, and with hope farewell fear." MLTON.   THE sultry summer had at length reluc- tantly departed. The city began again to assume the appearance of active life that throbbed and heaved with the burden of busy care through the winter. With the first fi'esh .breezes of autumn familiar faces once more crowded the busy thoroughfares; the levee again became the scene of animat- ed life; and trade and traffic usurped the hours hitherto devoted to the more languid pursuit of pleasure. In the early days of Indian summer, which with its usual caprice reigned through the latter days of September, while the land lay enveloped in the purple, hazy light, and the lordly monarch of day, after months of des- potic sway, vailed his face behind lightly floating clouds, Philip Grant with his wife and daughter wended their way homeward. Judith had plead so earnestly that their re- turn to the city might be postponed until winter, that Philip agreed, with little reluc- tance, to take possession of their new home amid the pine hills of the northern part of of the State. -The delay occasioned by this change of plan made -it near the middle of October ere they reached Pine Ridge, by which name the new home had been chris- tened. For many miles after leaving the railway station the road wound over pictu- resque hills, through dark forests of solemn- ly whispering pines, while occasionally the rich, autumnal light poured a flood of golden glory over the green foliage, while over the meadow grass of peaceful valleys meandered some purling stream, finding its way gradu- ally into a channel at the foot of long, slop- ing hills. The carriage-wheels ground over the peb- bly bottom, dashing the clear water into  foam, ascending the hill, from whose sum- mit and sides frowned steep acclivities, over- hung with clinging vines, from whose pen-   dent tendrils hung bunches of gooseberTies and the rich purple clusters of wild grapes. No signs of human life disturbed the sweet serenity of the hour and scene; and the oc- cupants of the carriage leaned back, each in the calm enjoyment fostered by the soothing motion, the sweet, fresh breeze that blew over the hills, laden with the breath of de- caying forest leaves and the odor of wild- wood blossoms. Crossing a rude bridge that overhung the channel of the wider creek, whose dark, cool waters flowed between banks laden with dank grasses and floating aquatic plants, Judith leaned forward with keen delight to survey a cumbrous water- mill, with huge, motionless wheel, erected near the head of the bridge, and which aid- ed in no small degree to enhance the beauty of the spot. "A mile further on, Judith, and we reach Pine Ridge. I trust you will not be disap- pointed." "Not if it be in keeping with the scenery through which we have passed. Papa, what could be prettier? -God bless our Southern land! Talk of Italian skies! Can Italy boast an hour like this?" As she spoke Judith threw back the cur- tains of the carl;iage, and leaned forward with her fresh, dark face and humid eyes turned to gaze upon the declining day. Tilhe sun was just sinking behind a group of forest trees, bathing their crimson tops in its mel- low light, while long shadows stretched east- ward. Gorgeous colors painted the heavens, around, below, on every side; while soft, fleecy clouds floated above in the mellow, changing light. Here and there a gleam of departing radiance darted through the trees, and rested upon the water, quivering among the dripping lily-leaves. The low, dropping murmur of the water, as it stole over its stony bed, mingled with the chirp of dron-   ing insects. While she leaned, silent and motionless, the crimson sun sank slowly through the amber sky; and then commenct ed the shifting panorama which precedes the rapid incoming of twilight in a Southern sky. The spell was broken; and the horses again moved slowly forward, obedient to the whip; and before the gray hue had given place in the west to the silvery light of the young moon, the gleam of stars revealed to Judith's expectant eyes the white walls of Pine Ridge. A gravel road wound through a well-kept lawn, with clipped shrubbery and smooth- shaven grass, to the hall-door; and, with an exclamation of childish delight, Judith sprang up the stairs, and stood waiting to receive her father. It was a handsome modern dwelling, on the most approved American  plan.  Broad verandas  ran around the- house, supported by richly carved Corinthian pillars; wide casements opened out upon the shrubbery, and a broad staircase through the hall led to the upper apartments, which overlooked the country through miles of hill and valley, upland and dale. Through the east window of Judith's apartment might be caught a glimpse of the old mill, the rude, overhanging bridge spanning the arch of the darkly flowing river; and here Judith determined she should direct her evening walks. It was all her fancy had pictured. She had some vague consciousness that this spot had been photographed on the camera of her brain, and now it seemed so natural. She leant from the open windows, listen- ing, half-dreamily, to the solemn whispering of the pines, the upward floating of the numberless voices that ' tell us of the night;" and the quick-beating pulse grew calm and soothed. She must descend, and thank her dear father, whose love had pro- cured all this; but as she turned reluctantly from the open window, her father's arms en- circled her, and she was folded in a short embrace, that told the passionate devotion of his heart. Few words ever passed between them, nor were they needed. There was a quick sym- pathy of thought and feeling that passed like an electric current between them, and $   bound them to one another in a tie that needed no wordy demonstration to evince. Of one heart and one mind, they stood now, arm in arm, in a quiet, loving communion, in which the wretched wife and mother could bear no part. The months of excite- ment and change that had ushered the graceful girl into the elegant woman, had brought the rapid current of her Southern blood into play upon the smooth damask of her cheek; basked in the rich glow of health upon her ripe, full lip, and the spring of a light heart to the bounding step. The light of contentment and happiness lurked once more in the changeful depths of her brilliant eyes. In Philip, the change had been no im- provement. The coarse features had broad- ened, the lines which thought and study had written sternly about the brow and eyes had somewhat relaxed, and given place to the smooth, sensual cast to which his fea- tures belonged. The temptations of the outer world had broken through the forced abstemiousness of his rigid life. The sweet face and musi- cal voice of his Judith had been powerless ofttimes to withhold him. If a shade of serious thought now rested upon Judith's heart, or cast its reflection on her brow, it was when such a knowledge forced itself upon her. To Rachel, time and change had brought only, perhaps, additional pain and weari- ness. The restless fever which had con- sumed her, when the one hope of her life remained, seemed to have given place to a dull hopelessness that was harder to bear. As day by day she struggled through the weary hours, the question arose withil her, "For what good am I here?"Now, alone in the room which under his roof had been assigned her, she bowed her head upon her hands, and wept bitter, passionate tears of regret for the past Why had she not bent her proud spirit at her husband's command? Repentance had come too late to save her. Burdened with useless regrets for that bit- ter past, she struggled with the doubts which now frequently assailed her. Had duty, the stern goddess upon whose altar she had laid the early sacrifice of her nature, been appeased? Had sacrifices made  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7518-00000024"/> in such a spirit been accepted? She knew not; and in the agony of that failure, with the wreck of her blasted happiness before her, she knew that only when God had crushed the pride from her heart-when, with meek and lowly spirit, she assumed her cross-would rest and peace be found. Yet, whence was that spirit to come? Through prayer?  AlasI had she not prayed. Through self-sacrifice? Her whole life had been one. The hour had not come when she could feel in -full the atonement of Christ's blood. If she could only bear up now, for her child's sake, all might be well. She knew Judith's nature; she knew the effect which contact with the world would have upon her quick, impetuous temper, and she trembled for her daughter's future. Ah I if, by her side, she might shield her from harm I After a fierce contest of doubt and tears, Rachel would kneel down in her solitude, and, with her pale, cold face uplifted, plead passionately that the misery of her own life might. prove atonement for her sin. The pure mother-love leaped to her lips in prayer that that young life might escape the shadow of her own fate. If the conflict had proved more than even her cold nature and calm temperament could bear, how should this impetuous spirit withstand the storm? She could reason only from the stand- point of human foresight, and how thus measure the infinite goodness of God'? Could she see that from the very temptation which she prayed might be spared her child, that bright spirit should rise grandly to honor its Creator with the workings of a God-given nature?  And when the hour came, Bachel forsook her false god and acknowledged, in lowly humility, the true. The teacher was taught, and the mother learned true wisdom from the life, not the teachings, of her child. From such struggles she would pass to their presence, pale, calm, composed innMan- ner, while the flames of fierce conflict burned still within. Even Philip found little to grati- fy his malicious spirit. Her self-control had baffled even his vigilant eyes. His manner I to her of late had become exceedingly offen- sive. From the rude sarcasm that had once ( pained her he had passed into an affectation I   r of polite attention which ill concealed the Iirony lurking beneath; and which, to her sensitive nature, proved almost insupport- able. Judith -had marked the change, at first with a half feeling of perplexity as to lits cause, then with a haughty displeasure toward the unoffending governess.  How dared she seek to entrap her father? for this was the conclusion at which she ar- rived; and the apathetic scorn with which Rachel rewarded his attentions, so far from allaying her suspicions, only confirmed her belief in her art and duplicity. Judith was not one to conceal such sentiments, for heart spoke to lip from its passionate dictates; and the new pang was added to the mother's heart in the ill-repressed sarcasm, the taunt- ing insolence that curled the beautiful lip of her daughter. What commingling could there be with such elements? Judith impetuously demanded the banish- ment of her governess. "I am no longer a child, papa; I do not need her services, and I fairly hate her." How the demon in Philip's heart leaped at such an admission from- her lips I With artful words he led her on to dwell upon Rachel, sympathized with her feelings; and finally, as she grew vehement in her de- mand, promised to see Rachel after tea, and endeavor so to arrange matters that, without casting her again upon the world, Judith should be freed from her presence. Too much excited to remember that from her vicinity to Rachel's room her every word was audible, Judith continued; while'Grant, with an occasional word of deprecation, art- fully added fuel to the fire. Was this not the very.,refinement of cruelty? The mo- ther heard the reviling of the lips that had once smiled in all the unconscious beauty of infancy upon her; and sank, with a deep wail of heart-broken sorrow, upon the floor. She could bear no more. In her calm and once gentle breast arose a fierce feeling of hatred to Philip, an eager desire for revenge upon her heartless hus- band. Rising, with hueless cheek, and eyes glittering with excitement, she passed rapid ly from her chamber, and laid her hand upon the latch of the door through which she could still distinguish the murmur of their voices. He had failed in his compact; had   / - . dealt with the treachery which formed part of his nature by her; and she would stand between them, and, forgetting her own bro- ken promise, forgetting all but the passion. ate cry for"her child's heart, she would claim it by every memory of the mother's, wrongs.  False, base, treacherous, what right had he to bask in the happiness of his daughter's smile; while she, poor, wretched mother, stood without, dumb and hopeless? Words would be given her to plead a right- eous cause. Ah! why did she hesitate? Could not this great misery leap to her lips, and claim the heart of her child? Hesitat- ing, bewildered with the unwonted gust of passion that had swept over her, she yet de- layed; and, while she stood irresolute, the door was swept widely open, and Judith, with glowing cheeks and stormy eyes, stood before her. Poor Rachel, conscience-strick- en as some guilty culprit, fell back before her, pale and unnerved; while Judith, every beautiful feature working with the contempt- uous scorn she felt for the detected eaves- dropper, her haughty eyes blazing upon her, scarcely deigned to listen to the feeble apo- logy or attempted explanation; but, with a silent gesture of disdain, which her quiver- ing lips refused to sustain, swept from her sight. Rachel gazed after her for a mo- ment, and in that moment the remembrance of duty returned to her. Could she abandon that willful, passionate creature, untutored  save by her own heart's dictation? Could she leave her alone? The hard, unflinching image before which she daily bowed stood I again beside her, frowning stern rebuke, and laying its icy finger on its lips, whispered, "Peace, be still!" and Rachel was again herself. She entered Philip's room, quiet, ( and with a firm determination which neither  sneer nor ridicule could overturn. "I do not reproach you, Philip, with your v treachery to me. I merely warn you that, for every such act in the future, I will meet d it by any means which may present itself of checkmating you. I now insist that you h comply with what I conceive to be only a just demand." "Madam, while I honor your sincerity, I s admire the wisdom which prompts you to v give me timely warning. 'But for the un- I qualified expression of your daughter's opin- b   t ion of you this afternoon, I might have pro- i posed a renewal of the tender intercourse - which once rendered us mutually happy. I * presume, however, under the circumstances, I it could hardly enhance our felicity." s  A sneer curled his lip, ill concealing the t tremor of passion which her open defiance s had aroused. The faint flush which dawned I upon Rachel's cheek at his shamelessness I awoke an insolent admiration, which, heated by wine, and the excitement of his recent ? interview with Judith, he boldly avowed, exclaiming: "By Jove  Rachel, your beauty might tempt me yet, did I not know its--" One glance from the distended and strange- ly dilating brown eyes, and the coarse and brutal insult died upon his lip. With that glance flashed anew-the ever-recurring con- viction of the purity that had stamped itself upon that pale face. He followed her to the table, where she drew a sheet of paper to her, and, taking a pen in her hand, wrote: "Mrs. Harleigh has claims upon me so great that I can not' accede to, your request; it is optional with her to remain." "Sign that," she said, pushing it toward him, and holding out the pen. "What if I refusd," he said, folding his arms and looking down upon her. "I reveal to Judith the relationship be- tween us; proclaim to the world the tender- ness with which you have acted toward a weak twoman-" "Ay, and add your own sin to the list," he said sneeringly. Rachel bowed her head silently. "Would you dare that?" he questioned. "I will dare all things sooner than relin- quish my place at her side," she returned, calmly meeting his gaze. He tore the sheet down the middle, and wrote rapidly: "Judith, Mrs. Harleigh must remain un- der my roof while it is her pleasure to do so. If you wish an explanation, seek it from her.          PHLIP GRANT." He handed it to her with a malicious smile: "She already hates you. Present her with that, scrap of paper and widen the gulf. You could not have played into my hand better had you desired to become my cham-  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7518-00000025"/> pion." Rachel crashed the paper in her hand, apd silently left the room. When Miss Grant retired to rest, the note lay on her table. Hastily descending the stairs, she knocked at her father's door. It was locked. "Papa," she cried, "dear pa- pa, let me in. You can not have meant this to me!" The door opened abruptly, and Philip, drawing her suddenly in, cried hoarsely: "Hush, Judith, my darling. Do you think any living being should come between us? You know her now--hate her." Judith, still tremulous with excitement, gazed into her father's face wonderingly. Was he mad or drunk? What was this woman to them? Why should he cringe to her, and yet deceive?"What is it, papa?" she whispered soothingly. "Nothing. Never mind now, my queen. We'll off to town, and leave her behind. Back again to the old house and our happy life together. Ahl Judith, what have we gained?" Judith winced, and while tears dimmed her bright eyes, quenching them in mist, she   murmured: "Forgetfulness, papa, forgetful- ness." He was quite subdued now, and drew her to him caressingly: "Ay, sweet one, to both; but to me such as the wine-cup and dice-box can bring. Off with you; and pray that the evil one may not usurp his throne in this breast." And Judith stole up the stairs, and, kneeling in her white dress, prayed for him who was dearer than her own life; thanked God, too, for the peace that- had come to her after that first bitter pang; while gradually, as through the me- dium of such thoughts quiet stole over hers the sweet face grew overcast with a beauti- ful penitence. She lay down to rest with a consciousness of self-approbation which holy communion with its Maker ever brings to young hearts, untouched by the corrupting influences of a hard world. Alas that such a season must give place to an age when reason asserts her sway, to control the heavenly impulses of a generous nature with the cold maxims of prudence and policy.   CHAPTER XIV. "HER face, So lovely, yet so arch, so full of mirth, The overflowing of an Innocent heart."   MORNING broke, crimson and purpling in the east; and the slanting sunbeams stole through the open window of Judith's room upon the beautiful face of the youthful sleeper. She awoke soon with a start, eager to act upon the generous impulse which had crept over her on the night before. For one in- stant she stood looking out over the lawn, heavy and white with dew, drinking in the sweet, fresh breath which belongs only to the early hours of morning. The sunlight glittered on her long locks, turning them to a deep, rich bronze, and rested on the fresh, glowing cheeks. She turned reluctantly to begin her hasty morning toilet. Fresh and cool in her white robe, with the deep crimson petals of a velvet rose rus, tling at her throat, she felt, as she bounded down the stairs, as if the events of last night must belong to the wild figments of a trou- bled dream. Her bright nature all aglow with the kinder impulses which had visited her wak- ing thoughts, she thought regretfully of her harshness to one a stranger, houseless and homeless, and whose untiring gentleness she remembered now remorsefully. She would make her some atonement; and her purpose gained strength and dura- bility while she moved about, engaged in the harmonizing occupations which formed a part of her moraing's employment. No hand but hers must minister to her father's comfort. Noiselessly she unfastened the shutters, letting in the clear, living sunshine, tem- pered through fleecy clouds of muslin drap- ing the windows; brought order out of chaos among the books and papers which littered the table; and, passing thence to the cheerful breakfast-room, dressed the marble vases in fresh roses and bits of fern, with   here and there a knot of scarlet berries peep- ing through clusters of green leaves. The duties of daily home life, however common- place, when fulfilled with a view to the com- fort and well-being of those around us, bring their own reward in the contentment and good feeling which they engender. Judith experienced this; and when her father warmly kissed her, noticing anew each evidence of her thought, though it was a daily recurring thing, her spirits rose to more than their usual tone of childish mirth and joyousness. In extreme youth there is an ever-bubbling fountain which casts from the spirit the impressions even of pain and grief, and makes the remembrance of lesser troubles evanescent as flitting shadows The underlying current of passion and emo tion stirs, trembles, bursts through the mo- notony of mere existence, then shintly closes over, only to be remembered by the sharp pang which recollection brings at some future day. Youth may sometimes ponder musingly over this mystery of its oDing, and perhaps, too, with a feeling of disappointment in it- -self, that tears and grief should die with all their cherished memories, even momentarily. But it is a far sharper agony to awake to the consciousness that this bubbling foun- tain of youth has ceased to play; that its sparkle can no longer dim the past or illu- mine the future. Life is an actual thing, and its few events stand out sharp and clearly defined as stern realities, which romance can never soften and for which there is no forgetfulness. When Rachel entered, and, with her usual quiet unobtrusiveness, took her seat at the table, her pale face and heavy eyelids telling of a night spent in painful, agitated wake- fulness, Judith's really kind heart smote her for the part she had played; and, resolutely  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7518-00000026"/> quenching any remnant of false pride which may have lingered in her breast, she made an apology which was something more than graceful. It was truthful and earnest, giv- ing to Rachel the opportunity of clearing herself of the suspicions which she had, with some reason, formed of her. Perhaps she was somewhat disappointed at the manner of its reception; for how could she guess the cause of that unnatural composure un- der which the mother's heart throbbed and burned? Philip had raised his eyes keenly to Judith in no small astonishment. In any other woman he would have looked upon this simply as a good piece of acting, a coup to cover her own defeat; but all that be- longed to his child demanded a better con- sideration, and he instinctively accepted this as one of the unfoldings of her nature, mwhich it belonged to him to work out in the quietude of his study hours. Oftener than she guessed, she, and not Plato and Agassiz, was the theme of his stu- dies. The bright, fitful nature awakening from its dreamy, indolent youth, dawning into all the mystery of womanhood, yet with still the ardent impulses, the passion- ate caprice, and the willful affections of the 'child, appeared to him his only connecting link with the better life which his mental if not his natural faculties could appreciate. The day wore pleasantly away for the good deed which had ushered it in. Even Philip seemed softened and improved; and Ju- dith sat again, happy and contented, at his side, as in the old days, with a book on her knee, her fingers playing idly through her silky, crinkling hair. The clock ticked lazi- ly on toward noon, while Philip, his fierce eyes wandering from his book to the sweet, brightly colored face bent down beside him, argued with himself the doubtful questions which ever perplexed him when his better angel stood at his side in the person of his daughter, warring fiercely with the coarser temptations which beset his outer life. With- out her, his winsome daughter, with her loving words and sweet caresses, how speed- ily he would have sunk to what, indeed, nature seemed to have intended him. For, gifted as he was with a keenly analytic mind, which enabled him to grasp and mas- ter the problems of intellect, he was devoid   of- that graceful fitness which would have absorbed and presented them, varied and colored by his own originality. The mas- tery of language, by which he might have struck out some path of individual identity, and so drawn mankind with him, was not his to command; and the knowledge that, with first-rate abilities, he was unjustly un- derrated, made him, too, unjust to others and cynical in his self-examinations. .There seemed in his nature to be an utter depres- sion of all the moral faculties. Coarse, sen- sual, even brutal, a better instinct seemed only developed in a desire to hide his de- pravity from the knowledge of his child. Had his lot been cast in a social position less high, had crime and poverty tempted him, he would have followed the inward, dastardly cravings with a strange, eager pleasure, which, as it was, had -evinced it- self in a malicious desire to torture Rachel; to join her hatred to the bitter contempt he knew she felt for him. Now this feeling must be shown more sparingly. The spirit which Judith had shown might gradually expand itself into championship even against him, none the less sure that she still disliked Rachel. He was not deceived.   He knew  that, lurking at the bottom of Judith's heart, still lay the uneasy sentiment which she had so unguardedly expressed, and against which even now she was uselessly striv- ing. He knew, too, that there was a stern sense of justice and right in that young breast, derived, too, from perhaps the very worst feature in his nature, his unrelenting stoicism, which would plead strongly, and he feared successfully, against it. It proved a hard struggle sometimes for him to wear this Iaask constantly before his child; but he could not bear that her pure, young eyes should ever look into the black depths of that#ivil nature. - Not yet, at least; not while the latent fire that some- times leapt up unbidden in those young eyes, perchance regretfully, frbm the sources of her pure womanliness; rather burning, he knew, from the sources of his own dark current claimed by untutored nature until the purity of religious truth should strangle and subdue. Enough of the purity of the mother's character lay latent within her to G  .    .  .  .   have made her look with calm contempt upon vice from the throne of her womanli- ness. She had as yet never felt his unwor- thiness, which he endeavored so jealously to guard from her; for she loved him so en- tirely, and with a woman, love and trust go hand in hand, caught from the faith which underlies her nature, and from which she looks up to God and man. Philip would not for worlds have had her otherwise; yet a half curiosity formed itself within him whether there was not a stronger bond of union between his own soul and hers, than between the fair-haired, calm, and seeming. ly passionless woman whom he called wife. Time and circumstances might show; and with an unnatural, feverish longing for the certainty of this hope, if such it could be called, he sat watching her. He would have been content to imperil body and soul to feel that his child was his own- solely his own; owning no share of the pale current that flowed through her mother's veins. While Rachel would have given every drop of her life's blood to have felt- that that bright, young nature reveled in a being raised above the passions and sorrows of either-a nature all her own, and which neither might share. She felt the   father's unworthiness; shq had an agoniz- ing certainty of her own. A want of hu- mility was not one of the faults of Rachel's character. Perhaps had she possessed a juster appreciation of herself, her involun- tary sin might have weighed less heavily upon her, and the consequences, so fatal to the happiness of herself and others, might have been avoided; but in the first bitter humiliation of knowing her untruth to the vows she had made, rather to God than to her husband, she had been smitten with so strong a sense of her unworthiness, touched with so deep a desire to expiate her offense, that her sense of the real duty which lay before her had become blinded, and she had only committed a greater wrong in seeking atonement. How often, when the great duty of life lies plainly before us, we go astray--grop- ing blindly through self-confidence, and only awakening to self-reproach when the door- of atonement is closed upon us. Yet I am, still unwilling to believe that, if we cast from us the garment of pride in which we- enfold ourselves, and humbly seek to take up the right path, even at the end of life'sl journey, good may not come.  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7518-00000027"/> CHAPTER XV. "BuT see the fadidg, many-colored woods, Shade deepening over shade, the country round Embrown."           THOMSON.   WHEN the evening shadows began to creep eastward, Judith laid aside her book, and, resolutely facing her own heart, determined fully to quench the evil within her. To her request that Rachel would accompany her, the latter assented, and they sallied forth to ,Judith's favorite haunt. Autumn still lin- gered on the hills, and swept its wild-wind melodies through the crimson tops of the forest trees; sweet blossoms bloomed meek- ly in the shadowed nooks of the overhang- ing cliffs, while the purple-tinted evening -mist hung motionless or rolled in heavy -masses over the creeks. Now and then the -chattering of busy squirrels over their win- ter harvesting of brown nuts disturbed the -still air that breathed so freshy from dew- ,ropping skies. There is a calm serenity which steals over the heart in an hour like this, which rebukes the stir of human passion and deepens even happy thought into a tenderness that is near :akin to pain. Perhaps Rachei's downcast -face bespoke some such feeling; for Judith, ,casting upon it now and then a sidelong ,glance, felt a new desire to know something :more of this life which was beginning to arouse her pity and curiosity. The event of last night had shown her that the cold. mess of her manner was assumed or had 3been force d upon her by circumstances. :Perhaps there was some spell in the hour; ;for when Judith, seated on an abutment of ,the bridge, with the water at her feet, watch- ing the sunlight glow and fade over the hills, ;and twilight deepen over the land, had, al- umost forgetful of the identity of her whom ;she addressed, spoken with the freedom of ;girlhood of her past life--of the fitful glimpses of good-alas! so often speedily -dispelled, and ended by saying: .' Perhaps, ;had my mother lived, I would know better what. is right; but I have had no teacher   but my own heart, and I too often distrust it;" then Rachel, her calm, gentle face and clearly defined profile turned against the evening sky, had repressed the wild heart-throbbing, and spoken of the duties which claim us and from which we have no right to turn, even at the passionate plead- ings of the heart. She had meant to teach the duty which becomes sweet through submission to His will; had not felt either cold or stern, but the manner and words seemed so to Judith. Had she told something of the sorrow through which her own perception of duty had been quickened, Judith might have felt some sympathy; but this cold, unloving image which Rachel set up and bade her worship she could not fall down before and serve. She would have felt more kindly too to Rachel, and pity, so natural to young hearts that in many cases it overleaps jus- tice, would have usurped the place of aver- sion. But it was not to be. There are some natures to whom it seems impossible to as- similate, and this seemed a case in point. Duty had walked persistently at Judith's side the whole day, but it had been a warm, bright, loving image, that had taught her kindly words and softened the haughtiness habitual to her into a tender, womanly grace that was perfectly charming, and for the time perfectly natural. It had laid a warm hand on her heart, and now, seen beside Rachel's naked image, Judith turned indig. nantly from the latter. It seemed too much interwoven with the pride with which she had been battling all day. The autumn days were passed. in busy household morning employments that break so-healthfully upon the hours of a woman's life; the afternoons in long strolls, some- times westward through waving fields of ri- pening grain with the sweet scent of new-   mown hay; the sharp whirr of the scythe cut- ting the air, the laughter and idle chat of the workmen, the lazy contentment of the brows- ing cattle-a perfect Arcadia of blissful peace and plenty. Here and there a path emerged from the dim forests upon some cottage nook, with vine-covered front and blue, curling smoke; and while Judith felt it all dream- ily, with her silent companion at her side, the sweet lines of Bryant stole to her lips: "And comes the calm, mild day, As still such days will come, To call the squirrel and the bee From out their winter home; When the sound of dropping nuts ls heard Through all the silent wood, And twinkle in the smoky light The waters of the rill. The south wind searches for the flowers Whose fragrance late he bore, And sighs to find them in the wood And by the stream no more." No event broke the smooth monotony of their life. Philip had ceased his insolent attentions to Rachel, and was seemingly as much interested in farm-work and the lite- rary, occupation of his morning hours as could be wished. His ill-humor occasionally found vent in terrible outhursts toward some negligent groom or farm-laborer; but to the inmates of his domestic circle he had be- come more than usually polite and well- behaved. So the autumn passed silently into the list of forgotten  things-silent chronicle of the daily life, yet speaking- in unheeded tones of the flight of time, which was daily -bringing them nearer to the solemn mysteries of life, and remembered only as a season of exceeding beauty and peace. Winter had come, and the hills had grown brown and bleak. Huge piles of red and yellow leaves strewed the ground or drifted in the hollows of the trees. The tall pines had ceased their solemn whispers and stretched their bare and leafless limbs heavenward; while the sun rode coldly in the blue sky, or dropped down, round and fiery red, in the western light, coiling the purple masses of cloud around him for his long slumber through  a winter's night. Heavy rains had washed the yellow sand of the road into a solid, compact mass, and streaked the red overhanging cliffs; while the dark water flowed gurgling over its   stony bed, and dashed the long silent wheel with its huge paddle, noisily humming a merry-go-round. What a keen enjoyment this added. to Judith's favorite walk! She took an almost childish pleasure in watch- ing its rapid evolutions, whirling the foam about until the reeds and lilies tumbled on the other bank; in seeing the teamster goading his oxen through the heavy, yellow clay which clung to the cart-wheels as they moved lazily up the road, or stopped to drink at the spiral stream that bisected the road. She would wait here until the red had faded from the cold, wintry -sky, and the clear stars twinkled in the frosty light; then, drawing her shawl closely around her, follow the miller over the bridge, and so homeward. She had almost forgotten the old life in the city; the busy walk through crowded streets, where the' only glimpse of nature was the sky over head; forgotten, too, the day, still further back, when a blue-eyed, curly-headed, mischievous boy had brought her lollipops, and received a slap for his pains, from the haughty little beauty who queened it in her motherless nursery. She had never thought of Nevil Brent again until she met him one winter's day at the mill-stream. Then it all came back to her; but he was taking his lollipops to another market now, and never heeded her more than any other beautiful woman of the many he saw; nor would he have been worth minding if he had; she felt all this afterward. They met quite naturally, on the old bridge, with no shadows of coming fate darkening around them, with no heaven-directed inspiration to penetrate the hidden future. It was an every-day occurrence to meet strangers in so public a road, and in Brent she had only met a very old acquaintance., "Papa will be very glad to see you; of course you will stay with us a week or so?" Brent acquiesced, with a simple expression of the pleasure it gave him to meet them again. He surveyed her with a curiosity which gradually gave place to admiration of her very regal beauty. Her dress, of dark wine color, fitted closely her well-rounded form, and fastened at the throat with a small lace collar and jewel-  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7518-00000028"/> ed pin. Her rich, dark shawl hung grace- fully from the broad, drooping shoulders, and the quick, elastic tread seemed the very poetry of motion. A very pretty picture she made, with her clear, olive cheek glowing with health and exercise; her ripe, red lips parted in beam- ing smiles, that spoke her pleasure at the rencounter; while the dark lashes swept over eyes, brilliant, yet soft as some moon- lighted sea. She was very beautiful! There was harmony in every line, from her waving, sun-lighted hair; the small, elegantly-shaped head, so gracefully poised on the slender, white throat; the 'beautiful hand, clasping her shawl, so clear in its olive tint, with slender, rosy-tipped fingers; the small foot, which guided the undulating motion of her singularly elastic figure. She ushered him at once into the very sanctuary of their home-her father's study; and Philip rose with alacrity, holding out his hand and crying, "AhI Nevil, my boy, I'm glad to see you!' Nevil surveyed him from his usual stand-point, and in that first clasp of the hand his antipathies were aroused. Judith had gone. up to put off her wrap- pings, and, perhaps, with a womanly co- quetry, to alter her dress; but when she caught sight of herself unshawling, under the light which streamed from the heart of the alabaster lilies overhanging her mirror, her artistic taste accepted the vision as un- exceptionable. She was heartily glad to see Brent, and ran down again gladly to the room, where, in the glowing light of the coal-fire, they sat, chatting of by-gone days, which were beginning to come back to her now,.and mingling with them was a vague consciousness that she had once looked down upon her boy lover as a great stupid fellow whom she could teach his figures, though so much his junior. It must be re- membered that Judith had no moral plum-   met by which to test the sound points of other natures, and she was too apt to look scornfully from the sublime heights to which her own conscious mental powers raised her upon the intellect of her fellows. She had that undue appreciation of intellect which belongs to youth; and, as she sat back, her hand shading her face from the fire-light, watching keenly the unresponsive features of Brent as he listened to her fa- ther's discourse upon matters in which, of course, he took not the slightest interest, a half sigh of disappointment struggled through her lips at the renewal of her early impression concerning him. This feeling did not wear off when, later in the evening, he brightened up in talking to her of the pur- suits which gave him so much pleasure, and in which he evidently took the same pride as other men did in intellectual pursuits. At the tea-table Rachel appeared; and there seemed something in her sweet, pale face and subdued manner which awakened some latent sympathy in Brent. He gave her a respectful. attention to which of late she had been wholly unac- customed, directed his observations to her, and, much to the surprise of Judith, elicited an appearance of interest in one whom she was fast learning to look upon as a beauti- ful automaton. They parted for the night, with a promise from Brent to remain their guest for a week; a promise the more read- ily given as Philip had placed his rifle and horses completely at his disposal, adding, "Judith will give you plenty of boating and- riding, and you may find a red deer out on the hills." Free country Wfe possessed a great charm for him; and Judith contempt- uously watched how brightly the deep-blue eyes could light up at the prospect of this, his own particular line of pleasure. "And he is so very handsome," she murmured with a yawn.   CHAPTER XVI. "THERE is no sterner moralist than pleasure."   THE family elements seemed to harmonize with greater facility while Brent remained with them; and Rachel day by day unfold- ed more of that inner being which had hitherto remained such a mystery. Joining in the walks and rides which Judith and Brent pursued together, she seemed to have cast from her something of the usual cold reserve of manner; and once or twice Ju- dith had seen her calm face illumined by a smile rippling over it like moonlight on a summer sea. How very beautiful it made her, this quiver of light that seemed to spring from the very depths of her silent nature I Brent was learning to watch for it; and his own face brightened when he could win it for his pains. He had been touched by some latent sympathy with this woman-more touched by her isolated posi- tion in Philip Grant's household; for Ju- dith, though her manner to Rachel was no longer unkind or even haughty, had a way of putting before her the consciousness of their relative positions which Rachel, shrink- ing and sensitive, was not likely to forget. It rather increased Judith's dislike of Brent to have him constantly reminding her of her own want of delicacy, by the grave, respect- ful demeanor with which he treated Mrs. Harleigh. Philip Grant really liked Brent; perhaps more than he di8 any one else, except his daughter and himself. He set very little value upon mental acquirements-paying a much higher regard to the business faculty which enabled a man to push his own way in the world, and to value justly the im- portance which he thus acquired. He knew Nevil to be an excellent man of business, a man of honor, and a man of the greatest moral probity of character; which latter, however, he rather regarded, as it proved an important stepping-stone to worldly pros- perity.   On the whole, he would willingly have seen him a suitor to his daughter; and, looking only on the surface of things, it seemed not improbable. There was early association, and a feeling which, to say the least, was friendly enough to warrant a hope that in time it might become some- thing warmer. Judith would have curled her haughty lip in superb disdain at the bare supposition of such an event; and Philip had the good sense to keep his hopes and his wishes to himself. Toward him Brent had conceived an instinctive dislike which only deepened on further acquaint- ance, notwithstanding Philip had been care- ful in his presence to guard against the sud- den outhursts of temper, the sneering cyni- cism which had become habitual. The week passed rapidly; sometimes in long rambles through the surrounding country, or sharp rides which Judith took alone with him; but more frequently in gliding over the wa- ter in Judith's little shallop, The Lotus Leaf. Then they would pass out into the broaden- ing current, swollen with the rains; with glistening sand 'beach strewed with pebbles and shells, or between steep, green banks with overhanging trees; with Rachel's clear, pure outlines motionless against the frosty sky; Judith seated in queenly repose on the stern, watching Brent's muscular figure swaying gracefully as his bent oars tossed the rippling current, or sometimes leaning over the side, dipping her slender fingers into the clear line of light in their wake, or trailing heavy, creeping bunches of water- plants, idly enjoying this lazy, dreamy life, that was such a delicious contrast to the emotional energy of her own inner exist- ence. Often the row was prolonged until the moon rose silvery bright over the clear, cold water, and Rachel would sing some sweet evening chant, to which 1rent joined his deep, manly voice, while Judith listened  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7518-00000029"/> in wondering surprise. Was Brent then to unravel the entire mystery of this strange woman? When the last evening came, Philip ex- pressed his hope of soon seeing him again in town. "Indeed, we follow almost upon your footsteps," he said and Brent politely offered to call in- Square and let Mrs. Dill know of their coming. "It would oblige me very much," Philip returned; "and once resettled, I trust you will do us the pleasure to call frequently." With his departure the glow faded from Rachel's face like the sunset hue from summer clouds; and when in a day or two the preparations for their flitting were begun, she was not sorry that the accident of a sprained limb rendered it impossible for her to accompany them, and it was settled that she should winter among the pine hills. It was a re- lief to all parties; and Rachel, after their departure, turned with a weary sigh to the peace which a solitude of many months seemed to promise. Alas could the mo- ther have foreseen the events of that win- ter! of that fierce temper and haughty spir- it refusing to bow to the burden of misery and shame which the future was busily pre- paring I And she had, after many months of anxious guardianship, been forced to al- 'low her, at the mast eventful period of her life, to go into the world alone. Judith had promised to write, and she hoped to glean somewhat from her letters of her surround- ings. For a long period they were filled with the gayeties of her life-the excitements so new- the novelties so pleasing to youth; a vein of mirth and joyousness running through and tempering the keen shafts which she launched at the puppets whose wire-pulling yet delighted her. But at length Rachel detected a scarcely percept- ible tinge of disappointment-a slightly bit- ter irony mingling unconsciously with the pictures of a lighter fancy. Perhaps the young writer was herself unconscious of it; yet this made it none the less painful to Rachel. She had been quite sure that it would be so. She knew Judith's nature was too deep for the ignorance and frivolity of every-dm life to please her long. When the first dizzle of excitement wore off, this.   young girl-reared in the quiet seclusion of home; taught, above all things, a love for truth and honesty,-an utter abhorrence of duplicity and falsehood, and believing in her innocence and girlish purity that all the world acknowledged the same rules whose simple wisdom had governed her own life; with no knowledge of sin, except that which is inherent in human nature, and yielding more to these because she had never been taught self-control, than through willful persistence in wrong; knowing of the existence of crime through the medium of books, and thus, forced to believe in its reality; having a scarcely better defined knowledge of the cardinal virtues; and re- ceiving but vague impressions through her outward senses of the life which, except in one instance, had never appealed strongly to her inner being-was now brought face to face, not, it is true, with crime, but with the lesser meannesses of hypocrisy and falsehood, which the world seemed tacitly to accept as its code of morality. At first -she was shocked and startled, then succeeded a doubt as to whPther this could be a general thing. Could this be the atmosphere in which Grey had lived and re- tained his beautiful enthusiasm; these the creatures for whom he thought it a duty to suffer and forbear? To her it seemed scarce- ly credible. Temperament and the habits of her life battled against it. Then came a touch of bitter pathos, which soon hardened into the polished cynicisms, the epigramma- tic sarcasms, which are so unlovely because so uniwomanly. At an-evening party, Judith had again met Grey, with his wife and sister, to whom he presented her after a slight interchange of greetings on his own part. One moment- ary glance of surprise, a half start of nerv- ous embarrassment, and Judith, her hand clasped in Elinor's soft palm, listening to her magical tones, learned that she, not Isa- bel, was the wife. With that knowledge came an almost- total revulsion of feeling; and when, after a short interchange of courtesies, they passed on, and she stood looking after them with a strange, thrilling recollection of Elinor's eyes and voice re- maining with her, she could quite forgive him. Before meeting him she had still re-   tained a dreamy remembrance of her youth- ful fancy. Her heart had throbbed tu- multuously at the mention -of his name still, as when she had murmured shiveringly, "Forgetfulness, papa, forgetfulness." Now, meeting him under the broad gas- light, his wife by his side, she had waked from her start to look again into the glad, blue eyes, the sweetly grave mouth, the curling chestnut hair, out of which shone the pure, polished brow. And the eyes that had once shadowed the romance of her own life faded, and in their depths she saw only the gravely beautiful spirit, the purity that spoke a heart gentle and" generous as a wo- man's, brave and truthful as a Christian man's, shrined too and fenced about with the strong defense of a wife's holy influence. At a glance, with the flash of an eye, Judith had seen all this, and thenceforth he was nothing to her. A cherished memory per- haps, as of the dead-still the being on earth who was most worthy of the pure, girlish affection she had lavished upon him; and so her dream faded, in after years to be still tenderly touched upon as the purest, holiest of human affections-a first love I Her im- pression of Elinor may perhaps be better conveyed by an extract from one of her letters to Rachel: "And this, the pale, brown-eyed woman, was his wife. I can not tell you, Rachel, what she said to me or I to her, for I do not remember, and indeed was scarcely conscious at the time of any thing that passed. I only know we both seemed to feel as if we had known one an- other before. There, was something like magic in her large, liquid, gray eye, in her sweetly toned voice; and I have an impres- sion that the sympathetic feeling was mu- tual. I might write you volumes without being able to convey an idea of the impres- sion she made upon me. "t His sister is singularly beautiful, yet I can not assign any satisfactory reason for the feeling of melancholy which creeps in to mar the pleasure which her beauty creates. Hillory, who I remember was quite a fa- vorite of yours, is very little changed, ex. cept'that perhaps he has a more elderly ap- pearance, an additional dignity of manner, a deepening of his usual serenity, as if he were truly happy and could not hide it if he   wished. But I must tell you something which, by way of preface, I will remark may lengthen into quite a story, touched too with the least bit of romance. It will serve to amuse your long winter evenings, which I hope are dull for -the want of us. To begin, you must know that before Brent had been with us long he .began urging papa to have my portrait taken as Cornelia. He was quite sure it would be a beautiful pic- ture. The style of face was strictly in keep- ing with a medallion in the --  gallery. '"He talked so much of it that papa final- ly became as much interested in it and as eager as himself, and proposed my going at once to E--, who is, you know, at present in town. "But here Brent had an objection, and finally it all came out. He had a friend, a female artist, very poor, yet who is, or, he says, would be, if she had leisure and op- portunity, a gifted and talented authoress. Now you may imagine the story, simply and plainly told, even as it was by him, quite elicited my sympathies, and I panted to play lady-patroness to the struggling genius- in short, to uncage the starling. I had quite arranged it all in my own mind. "She was young, beautiful; with heavenly blue eyes, ivory brow, on which inspiration sat enthroned, and a golden maze of sunny hair. After many appointments, we set out alone, for papa was-prevented by a business call from" accompanying us; and I thought afterward it was well he had not, for. I am sure my luminous beauty would never have been handed down to posterity in so coarse. a garb, and our authoress, artist, etc., less opulent by the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars. It was a cold, raw day, quite a common one, with a gray, hazy sky over- head, sloppy gutters, and dirty sidewalks under foot. Brent conducted me up several flights of narrow, crooked stairs, none the cleanest, and at last stopped on, I believe, the very last landing. "All this promised remarkably well. After a momentary pause of expectation, he pushed open the door, and I followed him in. I do not think she could have had the least idea of seeing any one, and am sure would have shut the door in our faces if she could.  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7518-00000030"/> "She had been seated in a large chair be- fore a grate, in which a few embers were burning slowly enough. It was quite the dusk of the evening, and so dark in the room that I could just make out a small, dark woman, with the deepest of black eyes, a perfect wealth of jetty hair, which had be- come loose and was coiling half way down her back. Her countenance was disturbed, yet I could not think she had been crying; indeed, I doubt if she ever does that. Her face rather impressed me as one that locked within those firm lips and compact brow its own griefs rigidly. "Books and papers were strewn over the table at her side, but I am sure she had neither read nor written for hours. There was a far-away look on the face, a distress- ing rigidity about the mouth, a weary lan- guor about the person, that spoke painfully of some internal conflict. "4Had I been alone, I should have re- treated at once, and am sure our absence would have been a relief; but she rose im- mediately, stirred the fire, threw on more coal, and lighted a heavy bronze lamp that stood on the table. By its light I disco- vered books, busts of bronze and marble, paintings-all the surrounding of true genius-yet not one article that told of the creature. comforts which I felt sure she needed, unless it was the deep crimson- cushioned chair from which she had risen. Now, in one moment, Rachel, all romantic nonsense died -out of my mind; for here was a woman, evidently not young or strong, yet as evidently areal genius. Living among the cold gods of her exalted worship, yet amid the very direst poverty. You know what a horror of poverty I have, how   it chills me through and through; indeed, if I am a sensualist, it is in the luxuriant fullness of pleasure which I experience in the contact with light and warmth and all the refinements and elegancies of life. "I now felt for her a sympathy that was born of something more than fanciful pic- tures of heroic virtue. Plainly and unpre- tendingly, with a singular unconsciousness of self, she was following the to me most exalted occupation of any life amid obstacles which I would have regarded as insurmount- able. She impressed me strongly with a sense of 'her own power. "She seemed so self-contained, sufficientat all times for self-government, and in all cir- cumstances! I could not but feel that, if fate should be against her, her life would still be no failure. Hers would be a perfect destiny, carved resolutely and single-handed. Of her intellectual faculties I could, of course, form but little idea in a first interview. . Of those, anon. I looked from her, after this rigid scrutiny, over to Brent, and in one instant it all flashed upon me. Can you believe it, Rachel? He is actually in love with this woman!  Had I heard it, without seeing her, it would only have seemed ridiculous; but having seen her, my opinion of Brent rose to a sentiment of actual respect. He, great, good creature, seemed perfectly will- ing that I should know his secret, though even after we had left he made no allusion to it, only looks and tones, and they most eloquent. My letter has run on, already, far into the night, so I will reserve the bal- ance for an early opportunity, which, if you are half as much interested in Janet Somers as myself, you will pray may speedily offer. Adieu for the present. JUDITH GRANT."   CHAPTER XVII. "WITH lightsome brow, and beaming eyes, and bright, Long, glorious locks, which drop upon thy cheek Like gold-hued cloud-flakes on the rosy morn." FESTUS.   JUDITH was quite right in her supposition of the trouble that was writing such grave lines on Janet's dark face, and numbing her faculties to languor and inertness. The win- ter had set in extremely cold. The money brought by the sale of her pictures was ex- hausted, and want was staring the artist in the face. Her dark room seemed again grim and cheerless; no bright light from crimson fires illumined its gloom; lights were al- most a forbidden luxury. The delicate ruby flasks and crystal goblets were empty, food of the coarsest and plainest only-was hers; yet she did not complain or despair. Writ- ing was a luxury depied, for the day must be given to labor, and there was no oil now for the midnight lamp. Powers had been frequently absent from town, and dur- ing his short, hurried visits had been un- mindful of-the pinching cold and want that had driven the flush from her cheek and was settling stonily about the eyes and mouth. Brent, her ever guardian spirit, she had not seen for many months. Once the man of letters, receiving nothing from her, had called to inquire into her idleness, but she had met him with a proudly courteous mien, simply stating that she could not write at present; and, only half guessing her secret through her womanly artifice, had gone away again with a high admiration of the "genius in a garret." Itwas now almost an old story-the dreary days, the longing for food and wine, the sleep- less nights. And when sleep laid its reluc- lant hand upon her lids, it was to bring dreams of contentment, and happiness, and plenty, and to wake again to want. Having said so much, we again take up the thread of Judith's communications to Rachel. I was quite puzzled," she again writes, "to make out whether Miss Somers loved Brent. Her whole aspect had so bright-   ened, her voice in addressing him was so tremulous, and I thought eager, that I al- most concluded she did. Here was a mar- vel, indeed, if it were true! Could this lofty genius stoop to such man-worship- for it must amount to that to conceal from herself his deficiency. Now, Rachel, it would be perfectly impossible for me ever to love a man upon whom I must look down in any way, most of all in this; yet I can believe there is that in the constitution of the really great mind belonging to genius, which can so separate and abstract itself from any thing but ideal contemplation, that it can and does love something quite its inferior. I more than ever realized this in watching Janet with Brent. On his part, there was some- thing so entirely given to the woman, a sort of chivalrous worship, which mere genius could never inspire, and which seemed to permeate. all through this woman, warming and lighting up her whole being. She ex- tended something of this warmth to me; and I, who had come to patronize, felt, some. how, exceedingly insignificant beside her. She readily agreed to paint the portrait, yet with none of the eagerness which is exhibit- ed by the professed portrait-painter, and which, with her evident poverty, would not have been unnatural. Then she went on to speak of the style of my face and figure, dwelt even-shall I say it?-on my beauty, quite as if it belonged to her profession, and in which she, as artist, had a much greater interest. I assure you it for the first time presented itself to me as a great gift, for which I ought to be extremely and humbly thankful. She disagreed with Brent as to painting me as Cornelia, saying I was not cold enough; that my face expressed too much passion and emotion. She wished to paint me as Ruth, amid her wheat-sheaves in the field ofBoaz; saying the golden bronze  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7518-00000031"/> of the hair and dark, almond-shaped eyes belonged to her peculiar cast of countenance. Imagine hearing all this of myself, and in that abstracted sort of manner as if she were rather thinking aloud than addressing her- self to me I! Brent yielded his fancy, agree- ing that, probably, the artist of the gallery was mistaken in his conception of Cornelia. I was very much pleased at the change from that cold Roman matron to brightly beautiful Ruth, with her golden wheat-sheaves, her sweet, oval face, out of which, I felt sure, would shine rather the spirit of the artist than mine, of utter self- renunciation: 'Whither thou goest I will -go; thy people shall be my people; thy-God my God: naught but death shall part thee and me.' After it was all arranged, we sat around the fire, and while she talked or listened to Brent, I was having my own thoughts. If she married him, I felt she would guide him, his nature looking up to and leaning on hers; yet it would be such a loving guidance, so tenderly covered over with the shadow of a grand, noble heart, that he would go through life all unconscious of it. By and by she turned to me, and then that marvelous power of mind which can never be expressed shone forth. The hours flew by, while I sat entranced. It was not so much eloquence, for I don't think she was. what you may term a talking woman; her words seemed always called forth by your own observation, yet characterized by an originality and freshness, a weird charm, as striking as it was peculiar. "When we rose at length to go, the fire had quite died out. The scuttle was empty, and I knew she would have no more that night. But her face had become transfigured with light and warmth. Several days afterward the sittings commenced. We have told papa nothing of our change of plan, and it is all to be a most delightful surprise. I am very anxious to have it finished, that I may pay for it, for I am sure she needs the money sad- ly enough; but she lingers over it, without a thought beyond the pleasure of conveying my Oriental face to canvas. Her other paint- ings are extremely coarse; but to this she seems to be giving more tone and finish. There is a large square of covered canvas which she guards jealously from prying eyes.   Probably it is Brent's likeness; I am very curious to know how she lives; but I would not dare ask her any question relating to herself. Once she' took me into her bed- room, when some men came into her studio on business, and left me there. The room was small and perfectly neat; a white bed, spotless as snow, a chair and small table, with a desk above. A cross hung on the wall opposite her bed; it was of some dark wood, curiously carved. A marble image of the Virgin and Child was on the mantle, and a small, fine painting of the Madonna hung by the window. There was neither carpet nor curtains; and the grate was clean  and guiltless of fire all winter. She is a Roman Catholic. So much I discovered, and nothing more, and this I had partly guessed. She soon came back, with a slight quivering about the lips, and sat down on the foot of the bed. For a while she seemed almost to have forgotten I was there, though she was staring straight at, or rather beyond me. Presently she rose, with a slight shake first,- as if to rouse herself, and walking across the room, opened the door of a small cupboard, took thence some cold meat, deli- cately sliced, and a half loaf of bread; brought them over to me, saying, with a smile: ";Will you share my dinner, Miss Grant? You see I have meat, because I want strength. It is not very flattering to self-love, is it- this predominance of the animal in our na- ture?' "I do not know what I said, while she went on quietly cutting squares of bread and meat alternately, and putting them into her lips. "L You see,' she continued, 'I have been obliged to learn economy in every thing. When one has only so many pence to spend, one must put it into something that will go a great way; and, you know, beef is very nutritious.' "This does not sound very romantic to write of an authoress; yet there seemed such a fitness in all she did, that each thing seemed the very best she could have done. I told Elinor of all this afterward, and she seemed so much interested in it that I have ventured to write it to you, hoping it will not prove tiresome,   "When she had finished eating, she got a cup of water from the next room, but only tasted it, and, setting it down, made a face. "' I do not like it,' she said; ' there is more good in a half-dozen drops of wine- real wine, I mean.' "After that we sat, laughing and chatting, until Brent came for me. It was quite late, yet I was very sorry to leave. Brent seems delighted when I praise Janet, and I am as much infatuated as he can be.'-' In another month Judith wrote: "The picture was finished and brought home last night, though papa did not see it until this morning. Brent had hung it in the back parlor, with the western light creep- ing over it, and we led papa up to it blindfold. When he was in the right place to have a good view, (for it would not bear too close inspection,) we unbound his eyes. There before him was, not I, but a real Ruth-the Ruth of the Bible-out in the open field, over which the dying light of day was shin- ing; her oval face, through which glowed the clear olive of her young blood; her dark eyes, with the pearly, almond-shaped lids, , heavily fringed; her round arms, bare, with i just a small portion of the bust uncovered; i   a yellow sheaf in her arms; and the hair- can mine be like it? It was like nothing I ever saw; sweeping back over her shoulders in a tangled maze, bronzed and glittering, with a wave of light running over and gleam- ing through it. It was beautiful! Beautiful from the figure of Ruth, with her dark eyes and sweetly pleading mouth, to the clear, hazy, grayish-blue sky, the dying sunlight, and the far-off figures of the gleaners. There was a strong likeness, but a likeness so poet- ized, so idealized, that I should not dare to call it mine, "Papa could not utter a word; he only gazed from me to the picture; and, after this had continued long enough to have wearied a bystander, turned away and wrote a check for six hundred dollars, saying, I It is worth a thousand to me, tell her.' His voice was quite hoarse with emotion.- Of course I tore it up, and made him write another for three hundred, the sum agreed upon between us- two hundred and fifty for the work, the other fifty for the frame. I should as soon have insulted her in any other way as to have offered her that check; yet I did wish very much she had heard what he said. Perhaps Brent will tell her."  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7518-00000032"/> CHAPTER XVIII. "AND does delirium utter such sweet words Into a dreamer's ear?"     LADY OF LYONS.   MoBb  than a month had elapsed since Janet had seen Powers, and she had had no line from him. He rarely wrote, and then the merest notes, which any one might read, yet which Janet treasured up for the dear hand that had rested on the paper, and so made it precious. - The dusk of a winter's evening was setting in, cold'-and gray,-with a wild tempest of wind moaning over the house-tops, rattling the panes, whirling up the long, narrow streets, and frolicking in mad revels with the passer-by. Janet stood At her window looking out on the street, and occasionally glancing at the bit of cloud visible. It ' seemed threatening snow; and she felt tempted to run out and encounter the storm, sooner than remain caged in her dismal room, without fire or lights, and with tonly her own gloomy thoughts for company. In a moment her cloak was donned, bonnet and vail hurriedly assumed, and she ran down the stairs and out into the bitter, frosty air. It was very cold; but she rather liked battling against the wind.- The quick walk brought the blood tingling to her cheeks and finger-erids, and her spirits rose into almost childish glee. She marveled at herself. It was so causeless I In an hour at most she knew she'must go back to a cold room and supperless bed. It was the first time she had been on the street in months; and now she came irnto the broad glare of the shop- lights on Canal street. Ah! how beautiful light was to her I How cosy the fires looked I It was almost too much for her philosophy. She crossed the pavement, and directed her steps into the more quiet neighborhood of the new town. Far up the street the long line of lamps quivered like dim stars in the dusky night. Clouds, dark and heavy, were scudding before the cold blast; and yet Janet pursued her way, in the very teeth of the wind, rather than return to such a home.   At length, footsore and rather fatigued, she retraced her steps, stopping sometimes to listen to wild bursts of laughter pealing out on the air, and mingling discordantly with the wilder bursts of the gathering tem- pest. - Once more. she paused, in a broad stream of light, turning her dark face eagerly toward it, then entered the narrow, crooked, and almost silent street that led to her own dwelling. How well she might write now, if she had light I She put her hand in her pocket, and, drawing forth her purse, counted the con- tents by the light from the porter's window. "Not enough even for bread," she murmur- ed, shaking her head, while a sadly patient smile stole to her lips. She entered the outer door and slowly ascended the stairs. Her room was very dark, so dark that she could at first distinguish nothing. Casting aside her cloak and bonnet, she groped her way to the fire-place. She was becoming accustomed to the darkness now, and could just distinguish the outline of a man's figure seated in her arm-chair. It was Powers! With a 'low, suppressed, tremulous cry, a half sob of speechless joy, she threw herself upon his breast. What a long, clinging em- brace, cheek to cheek, and lip to lip I He could have crushed the tiny form in his arms. He was the first to find voice. "Janet, Janet I Poor, proud, peerless Janet!- You have dared to say you loved, and yet so de- ceive I Not even a light by which you may see how unforgiving I can look!" She had struggled from his embrace, and a low, mellow laugh pealed from her lips. "Not light I O Stanley I my darkness is all gone!" Searching over the room, she found her last- candle, and lit it. "I's that all F he questioned, yet with a quiver of his lips. "All," she returned, not daring to look up.   "No coal," he continued. "Now, take me to your larder. It is invisible, but I pre- sume you do eat sometimes. Your land- lord, or rather his porter, tells me you have not been out of the house for months, and what could take you out in such weather?" "Nothing; only it was worse inside. Do not scold, dear Stanley; I am so happy, now you are come." "You can live upon it for all future days! Pray, now, what is to be done?" "God will provide," she said, in such simple humility that he could not smile. She was so meek, this grand soul! HHe could only turn away, and follow her into her room to the corner cupboard. It was quite empty I But there was a small sum of money in her purse; very small, indeed, yet sufficient for the wants of the morrow. Powers, with-a half glance around the room, turned and strode down the stairs. In less than half a minute he had returned to the outer room, and Janet went to-him. "Why did you not part with some of this useless trumpery?" he asked. "I could not bear to, Stanley. You gave them to me-at least, I always supposed so. I never wished for any thing, that it did not find its way here stealthily, and smile down upon me. I knew none other could have so guessed my very thoughts. I was not fool- ish-not very; for indeed, Stanley, I would not have starved first. As to fire and light, neither could have warmed or cheered much with you away 1"           I She knelt down by him. There was a { long, unbroken silence, during which she c had nestled again to his arms, laying her 1 head on his shoulder like a tired child. She i felt how closely he was holding her, how his r heart throbbed, though he spoke not a word. .t Hle was strangely touched for so callous a v man.                  S In less than half an hour the porter came t in, with coal, oil, food, and wine. The fire X soon glowed red and warm in the grate, its c weird light blazing over the room, creeping! a in among the busts and statues, flinging e crimson stains on the pictures and walls. ii The lamp was filled, but not lighted, for it o was not needed. , At Stanley's command Janet heaped the table with the hastily col- fi lected dainties, filled the flask, and, seated n   e opposite, he watched her with the most e- pleased face imaginable, while she ate her I- supper. He wanted nothing himself, only e to watch her. d  Her hunger wats soon appeased, and he "joined her over the wine. What a happy o meal it was I Only too soon over, and then zv Janet deftly arranged the table, stowed away in her little cupboard the remnants of her ! feast, rolled buck the table, and came again to his side. Powers threw his head back i against the cushions, and laughed a low, pleasant laugh. "Was it bitter, Janet, because I gave it, or were you too hungry to be proud V" Half pained, she raised her dark face to his. "Ah! Stanley I cap you not feel a love that can make even an obligation sweet? Dearest and best, when can you learn how humble you have made my proud heart, and to-night of all nights the very happiest!" She held his hands in hers, and was kiss- ing them passionately. He drew the dark face nearer, until it rested on his bosom, and passed one hand lovingly over her smooth, shining hair. The dear face was so thin and wan, the mouth pinched, and weary-looking; unshed tears moistened the liquid eyes, so wintry dark, so full of love and trust. He almost found it in his heart to whisper to her of the all-conquering power that was winning him to forget alike prudence and ambition. Why not make her his-give himself the right to stand between her and such harm in the future? At that moment she was more precious to him than any thing on earth. With a half feeling of shame that he could not trust his generous resolves to face daylight and cool reflection, he deter- mined to put a barrier between himself and the power to withdraw; and, leaning over, whispered in her ear. For some minutes she did not stir. The head lay pillowed on his breast, the arms drooped on his knee, motionless, breathless. He thought she could not have heard or understood; but in another instant the head was raised, and her eyes looked into his. How he remembered it in after years-that look of love so deep, of joy so unutterable! "No, no-it can not be. I am not so sel- fish. Ah! Stanley, it needed but this to make my cup overflowl How have I de-  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7518-00000033"/> served so great a love? How ever repay it, unless it be to stand between your weak- ness and my own selfish heart? Your wife  To share your name and honors, to be yours, beyond the power of death, even, to part I Tempt me not I tempt me not!"And cover- ing her face with her slender fingers, she bowed herself before him and wept. They were the first and last tears he ever saw her shed. Happiness had wrought what suffer- ing never could Powers was deeply moved. In after years he looked back upon this even- ing as the very best of all his misspent life. He was learning to prize her more, as her value showed itself above his reach. His pleading now was in all sincerity, but Janet, true to him, yet truer to herself, was firm.   Her pride was too great to subject itself to the faintest shadow of his regrets, as her love was too pure and unselfish to stand be- tween him and any possible interest. Could any thing have added to her happiness, it would have been the knowledge of his will- ingness to make such a sacrifice for her; and now, what more was needed? Heart- felt thanks to the Giver of all good closed the bright winteris dream, and Janet slept for the first time in many months, comforted and warmed, to wake without a care for the days to come. God had provided, and would again. Well she might treasure the memory of that evening, for it was almost the very last.   CHAPTER XIX. "AH! that a dream so sweet, so long enjoyed, Should be so sadly, cruelly destroyed!" MOOR. ,   WnEN Janet came into her studio the next morning, she found her table strewed with letters. A frugal breakfast laid out, she broke the seals and read them as she leisurely made this, her first real morning meal in many weeks. The first was from Miss Grant, thanking her, in her own and her father's name, for the pleasure she had given them in the portrait, and inclosing the check which Judith had made Philip reluc- tantly change. The second, a short busi- ness communication from the man of letters. He wished a series of political papers drawn up in reply to one of the leading Northern papers. It would be well remunerated, and he, knowing her need, had given her a first offer. Inclosed were notes, giving her the data. She knew all the kindness of such an offer, and, after a moment's hesitation, de- termined'to accept it; thanking him as he deserved, yet expressing truthfully her doubts of her capability for that sort of writing, and leaving him at liberty to reject them if they failed to meet his approbation. Her dark hour had passed I With means in hand and work before her, she need not again taste even the bitter-sweet of an obli- gation from Powers. She had reserved his note for the last: "DEAREST JANET: At seven o'clock, on Tuesday night, be ready to accompany Mrs. Grey and party to the French opera. No denial! Choose your dress to please my very critical taste. I shall be in to spend an hour with you before they call for you, and will pass judgment. Colson sings in La Favorita.      STANLEY POWERS."' Janet curled the crisp bills over her fin- gers and smiled. Did he think she would use them? There seemed something defil- ing to her in the touch! It was only a fancy, and, she felt, a foolish one, as she   looked around upon the many objects whichr she cherished as coming from him and which his money had purchased, yet there seemed some virtue in the transformation. She could touch with reverent hand the marble im- ages, read with loving eyes the books through which heart spoke to heart and soul to soul.. They were linked with some association of' hour and scene. But his money I No, no.. Yet how refuse it? She would go if he- wished it. He wanted her to hear the music- perhaps to watch from some far' corner the face he loved soften and brighten under such influence. It would have been sweeter with him at; her side, yet she had an instinctive feeling- that often proved to her a correct guide in her ignorance of conventional forms-that he had done only what was right. She be-- lieved, and truly, that it was less a regard: for the world's opinion than a reverence, highest and best, for the woman he loved. It was always a painful effort to Janet to accept any attention from strangers; yet how. far sweeter than ever before had become the- effort to sacrifice her slightest wish at his. command I Her note dispatched, she donned her bon- net and cloak, and proceeded on the to her rare expedition of shopping. And this was to be on so grand a scale I She knew better than to displease Powers by making a cheap purchase, yet she slightly sighed over the diminution of her newly gained treasure. The day was destined to be a pleasant one; to her in every way. On her return, her' important mission over, she found Brent just entering. How glad she was to see; his kind face again In listening to him,. replying to his questions-sometimes evad-- ing his shrewd guesses at her secret, which: she would not have him know-the morning; passed rapidly away. In the afternoon Elinor came in. Janet  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7518-00000034"/> had delayed her reply to Powers until she saw Mrs. Grey and had the invitation from her. Janet's first pleasant impression of Elinor had strengthened on further acquaint. ance, and, after all hour or two spent with her, she was really glad that circumstances had compelled her to accept the invitation. This short visit did much toward producing a friendship which, in after years, time and events ripened into perhaps the warmest feeling in Janet's breast. Dear Elinor Grey! Who could have known the pure influences of her womanly heart and mind, and not loved her? Certainly not Janet Somers, poet ahd artist, in whose breast dwelt that keen appreciation of all that was most good -and excellent in human life. Tuesday at length arrived, and Janet had ;scarcely completed her toilet-with some (difficulty too, without the aid of maid or :mirror-when Powers entered. He stood 'within the door, bundle in hand, stared a moment, while Janet watched his face with ?a nervous anxiety all too visible. It was quite perfect, quite in keeping, and the surveyed her now with a pleased smile. iRich, heavy, lustreless, and amber-hued, her dark hair wound compactly around her head, a wreath of purple grapes clustering above the brow, the ruby gleam from a single jewel sparkling on her breast. With a courtly gesture he raised her gloved hand Ato his lips, exclaiming: "Without throne, sceptre, or guards, still a queen." The hour -passed but too quickly, and with the roll of carriage-wheels, Powers, throwing a rich -ermine cloak over Janet's shoulders, bound- ,ed down the stairs and disappeared. The rapid drive, the unwonted excitement, and a slight sense of embarrassment had 'brought a slight tinge of color to Janet's -cheek; and, with her darkly bright eyes, ,her richly tinted robe, and singularly grace- ful pose, she formed a new attraction to Box 127. Seated beside her was Isabel, fair, -lovely in the purity of her white-robed ;youth, and unconscious of the admiration ,she was exciting. In a box on the opposite side of :the house sat Powers, his cloak -around him, leaning back, insensible to all ,but the occupants of Grey's box. Watching the eager flush of expectancy on the dark cheek of his mistress, his whole   attention given to the one who yet reigned queen in his fickle, heart, the overture ceased, and the curtain rose on the first act. It had nearly passed, during a breath- - less interest on the part of Janet. She was quite unmindful of the spectacle presented by the gorgeous building-the tiers rising one above the other, filled with the wealth, beauty, and fashion of the city. That which would have delighted another woman she scarcely noticed. The music, its insidious strains filling her with a pleasure that would not die with the passing away of the pageant-the wonderful voice of the prima donna thrilling her heart, and kindling with its magical power every passion and emotion of her being-these were the -enchantment of the hour to her. Near the close of the act, a slight stir was occasioned by the arrival of the Grants; and Judith, with her regal step, her marvelous beauty, swept into her seat. A new face! 'And every glass was leveled at her box. In vain she struggled to preserve the fashion- able composure of more practiced debutantes. A deep flush rose and spread over cheek and brow, tinging even the beautifully moulded shoulders and bust, and hiding it- self in the soft lace that enveloped her person. Her shining hair thrown off friom  the haughty brow and clasped with jewels, the curved lips tremulous with excitement, she drew the admiring glances of both dress circle and pit, until the notice became pain- ful; and-Philip, with a proud smile, leant forward and shielded her, until her com- posure was regained and the beautiful cheek had paled to a delicate rose color. Powers had followed the leveling of glasses, recognized Grant, and, after a long gaze of surprise arid admiration, threw himself back in his seat, muttering: "His daughter; and by Jove! what an oriental beauty: nothing of the mother, though." His gaze now wandered to Janet, from her to the sweet face and girlish form beside her, and back again to the Grants. The door of their box had opened, and Brent had taken a seat behind Judith. When the curtain fell, Powers, still wateh- ing Janet, had seen her draw in her breath, slowly awake to the reality around her, and sweep the circle with her glass.   It rested an instant on Grant's box, then fell, and a bright smile illuminated her 'wintry face. She had seen Brent I The falcon eyes of Powers had followed hers, had seen the recognition and its effect upon his mistress, and a keen, sharp pang of jealousy assailed him. I have said their natures were antipathetic. From that hour, Stanley Powers hated Brent, with the deep, passionate hatred of which his nature was capable. Despising him for his inferi- ority, he shrank from a comparison with the finer nature of his rival-for such he now knew him-to be. Too much maddened to remain longer under his present excited state, he seized his hat, and pushed his way through the door. As he turned, in making his exit, he saw Brent leaning over the Greys' box, talking to Janet. In the lobby he encountered a number of friends who, quite unmindful of his sa- vage demeanor, detained him with a discus- sion which lasted until the curtain again rose, when he shook hands and pursued his way into the street. Janet had never observed him at all. Of course, she knew he would be there--knew she should see him when the opera was over, and discuss with him the pleasure it had given her. For the present, she was living through the scenes enacted before her. Later on, Brent left the house. At the close of the second act, Janet glanced at the box, but, not seeing him, returned to the music, and thought no more of him. It was very late when the opera was fin- ished. After much difficulty, the carriage was regained, and they drove rapidly home through the darkening streets. Janet went up alone, and was still stand- i ing in her ermine cloak, Powers's gift, when  he came in.   She had waited for him- - looked forward, as she did after every plea- 1 sure of her life, to living it over with him; f but now something restrained her, and she 1 remained standing, leaning one arm heavily against the marble mantle.        C He had seated himself, and was watching v her through his fingers, watching the play t of her mobile features, striving to trace the source of each shade of feeling that quivered c over it. Was she thinking of Brent? Per- i   haps so, for, when he mentioned his name, she started and half turned, saying, "He left the house early." ,She had, then, noticed his departure, while not one glance had sig- nified her consciousness of his own presence. She must have known he would be there; yet she had betrayed neither interest nor curiosity. In a moment, he had planned an artifice which he felt would be a successful one. He knew every fibre-could play upon every pulse of her being. In her unguarded candor, she would betray herself if there dwelt in her breast, consciously or uncon- sciously, a sentiment of affection for Brent With his hands still covering his face, with his keen eyes still upon her, he said: "You noticed Brent's disappearance from   the house. I saw him come into the 'street: my way lay with his. We both proceeded some distance, when the fire-bell in the fourth district pealed an 4larm. Brent, ig- norant of my presence, paused an instant, listened, and then hastened in the direction of his engine-room. "' I followed him. He had not gone very far when we met the engine, rattling up the street, the usual crowd following. Brent was not in the uniform, but he sprang upon the car, and in a few moments was out of sight. When I reached the scene, nothing in the range of the terribly picturesque can exceed the sight which met my view.  The fire was a large one. Smoke, black and heavy, hung in huge volumes, through which the fierce flames were leaping. The heavens were enveloped in a lurid glare, the surging mass of human beings crowded together, swayed breathlessly to watch the work of destruction. A  group rescued from the flames stood shivering near, with pale, awe- struck faces. While the engines still played ceaselessly yet hopelessly on the devoted buildings, suddenly a cry was heard--a faint cry, in a child's voice, yet it pierced through the swaying mass. "One upward glance--it was a little child clinging to the framework of a third story window, its little arms outstretched for help to the huge living mass below. "A sudden rush-a pause; and as volumes of stifling smoke poured over them, as the hot flames again curled fiercely upward, the  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7518-00000035"/> heaving crowd swayed backward, and, with a hoarse murmur of pity -and horror, again became motionless. "Another wail from the little voice--the crowd parted with a rapid swaying mo- tion; then a wild cry of admiration, and one man had thrown off his {coat and hat, and, hand over hand, was seen rapidly as- cending the fagade of the adjoining house. "L' Madness, madness I'. they shouted; 'it is death; come back I' But he never moved his eye from the child's face." Powers paused,- Janet leant still against the man- tle; the firelight flashing up showed her dark face all aglow, her lips tremulous, her breath coming in sharp, short respiration through her closed lips. He continued: "Again and again he paused for breath. The silence remained unbroken, save the sharp crackling of the flames whose hot breath was scorching his face; his hands blistering with the heated bricks and iron. He has reached her at last. His arm out- stretched within the window seizes her; he holds her in one arm, descends carefully the first and second ledge; the wall trembles and rocks-no time is to be lost; he holds her at arm's length; a crowd of outstretched hands, a half murmur like the rushing in of an ocean tide, a half-suppressed cry, and she is safe! The crowd was swaying now in the wildest excitement; and before that cry has died away, the man is on the ground. It trembles with the shock, of the falling ruins, and he, the hero, is borne aloft by the eager hands of his admiring comrades- bleeding, blistered, torn, and coiled-a real hero in a fierce battle of life or death." Powers's voice had grown deep and art- fully tremulous. He had added to his sim- ple tale all the romance of imagination, all the poetry of feeling, to arouse the leart just awakened to fiction and fancy under the subtle influences of a passionate mu- sical drama. He had vailed his hero in mystery, and, when every nerve was qui- vering under his master touch, he saw her turn her face to him, eager eyes looking into his, while, in a voice scarcely above a whis- per, she said: "And the hero, Stanley!" Powers removed his hand from before his face, looked into the strangely excited one near his own, and said: "Was Nevil Brent!" "I knew it!" she exclaimed; "Strange I   but I felt all the time it was he." She had slid down now on her knees, her hands folded one over the other, her cloak falling back from- her shoulders, her eyes fixed on the firelight, all forgetful of his presence, all unconscious of his art. The poet, the art- ist had been aroused in the bosom of the genius. She was taking it all in, this glo- rious winter's tale, in which the poetry and heroism of ,life had overstepped the cold realities of existence to create something worthy of her admiration and worship. Powers saw not the fancy of the genius, but the feeling of the woman. His dark face inflamed with anger, his fierce eyes, full of distrust and bitterness, were fixed upon her. After a long unbroken silence, she again turned to him, and his cold face settled into its usual expression. "And you left him there, Stanley, in the midst of his triumph I Oh I how proud he must have been. A real hero," she repeated absently, " knowing his power, accepting homage which was his due, yet as a man should." A bitter smile curled the lip of Stanley Powers.  He slowly drew a- match, lit a cigar, and, putting it between his lips, puffed once or twice -before he removed it, saying, with a half-suppressed yawn: "No; I left him at the Union Club, drinking beer with the crowd." How artful it was I The few words so naturally spoken, in which no tinge of irony appeared, the indifferent manner, the seem- ing want of design, in which the poetical mist'which had enveloped her scarred hero had vanished in the fumes of a coffee-house, amid the beer-drinking revelry of a dirty rabble! The tale was perfect-no touch of romance had been taken from that;. but the transition from the poetical to the actual in the person of the hero had been too sudden for the sensibilities of the genius. Powers watched the glow fade fronm her face, cursed Brent in his heart, and, .rising, coldly put her aside and departed. This was the first coolness that had ever arisen between them. Powers, connecting it with Brent, felt a strong sentiment of resentment against him and against Janet. With a wo- man's intuition, she was conscious of the con- straint, yet was far from guessing the truth. So they parted, to meet again when and how?   CHAPTER XX. *"A SOLEMN vow was spoken, That thy heart should not be changed;  But that binding vow was broken, And thy spirit was estranged."   IT has been said that the power of ha- tred is never so strong in the human breast as toward one whom we have injured; and when Powers, from the obscurity of his opera-box, gazed upon Philip Grant, all the worst passions of his nature were aroused. Philip had never, by word or token, sig- nified to Powers any belief in his or his wife's duplicity or treachery; yet Powers had never met his fierce eyes bent upon him without quailing in his cowardly conscious- ness of the wrong he had done him. Philip's hard lip would curl with a grim smile of satisfaction. His manner had be- come one of haughty, insolent patronage, which the fierce temper of Powers could ill brook. Looking upon him now, he remem- bered all this; knew that the right and the power were on Philip's side, that he had no accusation to meet by subterfuge or with truthful denial. Philip had pursued a more galling system of revenge; had left him powerless against covert sneers and insolent looks. An open insult would have been speedily avenged, for the man had no cow- ardly heart, and could meet any foe face to face under the daylight and .never flinch; but let any who have suffered under the species of torment which Philip inflicted upon Powers say if any punishment for an offense could be more ingeniously torturing. Philip was too much a man of the world to deny 'to Powers his acquaintance and the occasional right of entrance- to his house, but he jealously guarded against any de- gree of intimacy with his daughter. The antagonism of the father seemed to extend itself to the daughter. She had conceived toward him, on a first introduction, a repug- nance which seemed unaccountable, and which, with her usual sincerity, she-had not attempted to conceal-treating. him with a coldness which seemed only to increase un-   'der his efforts to dispel. Piqued at each fresh evidence of her dislike, and which formed a new feature in his intercourse with the sex, he determined not only to over- come the feeling, but to replace it with one warmer than friendship. What sweeter re- venge than to know that Philip Grant's beautiful daughter loved him? The experi- ment was worth the trial; and he studied- her character with that keen insight which belonged to him. She was proud, impe- rious, passionate, yet tender, truthful, and generous. Time and patience were both needed under the argus eyes of the father, and these Stanley gave. Condescending in the rare opportunities which offered to put forth all the power of his highly cultivated intellect, he could dazzle and charm; and though some revelation of innate coarseness would jar upon her and revive her first im- pression, Judith, with her keen appreciation of talent, was gradually yielding herself to the charm of his subtle and sympathetic mind. Later on, fate offered an opportunity for a closer intimacy. Philip, once again subjected to the influences which had proved so baneful to his youth, fouind that yearns and abstinence had-not blunted his pas- sions, and, the cup once more at his lips, the sweet influences of home, the tender ties of affection, were forgotten. From small be- ginnings he had plunged boldly in; and, reckless of consequences, regardless of all but this mad passion, was giving himself up to ruin and disgrace. As time went by, the humiliating truth forced itself upon the re- luctant heart of his daughter. He who had been to her an object of veneration and love was sinking into degradation from which she felt powerless to rescue him. The delicious hues in which hope had enveloped the fu- ture had banished. Crushed and humiliated,  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7518-00000036"/> she gave an ear to Powers while he stren- uously sought to obliterate from her mind her former impressions, giving to her now a subtle tenderness of pity which subdued her heart without wounding her sensibili- ties. In the midst of her trouble; Judith awoke to a consciousness that a sentiment deeper than gratitude and friendship had usurped the place of her former aversion- awoke to find that the heart she deemed buried in the sweet, tender memories of a past had arisen from the ashes of a first love to a passion deeper if not truer than before. Quick to discern the change of feeling- guessing even before she did that his power over her was supreme, and now awaited but his pleasure to call it forth, he gradually withdrew from her presence, maintaining an ever stronger hold in their slender inter- course, piquing her jealousy, arousing her tenderness, trying to gratify his insensate vanity with the richest treasure that woman can bestow--a passionate and devoted heart. How unlike, in its outward influence, was this fierce, consuming passion to the pure, girlish affection of her younger days! Hu- miliating it certainly was to her, for she felt it had been unsought, and was unreturned. Her pride smarted under such wounds as it was his malicious pleasure to inflict, and which none knew better how. She, who had once scorned this man in all the insolence of her beauty, her youth, her aristocratic sympathies, could have stooped to sue for the love he withheld. She knew that, under all, he bore, unforgivingly, the recollection of her insults, yet she loved him'; clinging with a tenacity only not humiliating because too terribly earnest, to a faith in the better nature which belonged to him. Night after night Powers met Grant at the gaming-table, sometimes as his opponent, but oftener to watch with supreme contempt the bloated, eager face of the gamester bent over the table. Powers was a man of strong pas- sions, but his passions were subject to a strong, will; and though perhaps gambling was one of the strongest, he would have despised him-' self could he have yielded to it as he now saw Grant. While Philip hung gloatingly over the board until the broad lightof day crept into the room, and the gas-lights flared   dimly in the smoky atmosphere, Powers, the elegant habitue of the saloon, would, after an hour or two of careless play-always on the winning points-rise, and, drawing on his gloves, measure himself in the glass, cast a contemptuous glance at the hoary-headed gambler, and exit. It was with a strange sense of satisfaction that he became a look- er-on in Philip's downward career. He was rarely his opponent; with a half feeling of pride, refrained from a chance, even, of win- ning his gold; yet he rejoiced that fortune and honor were slipping from him.   The measure of his revenge would be full in the degradation of his enemy. Brent, too, had become a frequenter of the saloon, only as a looker-on, however; and, filled with a deep pity for Judith, determined, if possible, to rescue Philip from his infatuation. . He was too well read in human nature not to see the exultation of Powers, and to form a shrewd guess as to its source. He disliked Powers extremely, yet here acquitted him of any of- fense which the world would not readily pardon.   He, Powers, had not led Philip into error, and was surely in no way respon- sible for his excesses yet a word, a chance remark, had often plunged him more deeply into his reckless career, and this Brent, with his calm, cool watchfulness, had observed. Brent belonged to no school of either moral- ity or religion, yet there was that in his nature which made him see that it was not in the right of him, or any other man, to permit wrong in a fellow-man. He might not dic- tate to another, but his views were clear enough to himself, and the view that he who permits a wrong becomes a party to it had somehow worked itself out to him, without the aid of metaphysics. It had, then, be- come his part to watch the fortunes of this man; and, conquering his repugnance to Philip, he never shirked the task he had set himself to. He stood now, nightly, a   cigar in his mouth, coolly, calmly, warily watching the game of hazard. Powers divined somewhat of his thoughts, and of the purpose which kept him there, and such espionage chafed him, and added to his dislike of Brent. He resented his presence as an impertinence, but Brent resolutely repressed all evidence of his dislike, maintaining an unruffled com-   posure under the polite sarcasms which Pow- ers flung defiantly athim, becoming imper- turbable and stolid in proportion as Powers evinced his annoyance at his presence. Pow- ers had made more than one attempt to turn the laugh of the room against Brent, and had succeeded, until Brent had turned quietly upon them, and the leaping devil in his eye had quelled their raillery. Then was added another item to the al- ready bitter hatred between these two. While Powers still struggled in the meshes which events and his evil passions were weaving around him, Fate offered a tempta- tion which, to do him justice, he for a time resolutely resisted. One pure spot yet re- mained untainted in that dark nature. We have said that, by marriage alone, could Powers place himself in that position in life which he so ardently desired. A false step here must undo the work of the past. An ambitious connection would at once es- tablish him in the eminent circles in which it was his wish to move, and pave the way for a future which, with his talents, lay daz- zlingly within reach. Yet now, when acci- dent and good fortune pointed the way, when the goal seemed within reach, and he need only stretch forth his hand and take, something of the better nature showed it- self, in efforts perfectly sincere yet feeble, to thrust from him an unworthiness so great. To forsake deliberately the real love, his peerless Janet, his trusting bride-he could not willingly cherish the thought. The con- nection with Iiillory Grey was a desirable one in every point of view. Grey was a suc- cessful politician, a man of extended and powerful family influence, and his high moral probity, his Christian principle, so tempered his ambition that he would not be likely to stand in the way of his more grasping com- petitor. His tastes were more domestic and literary than political, and his cordial sup-   port would be extended to advance the for- tunes of Powers. To a marriage with Isa- bel, under other circumstances, he could have looked with pride and pleasure. Nothing, then, stood in the way but that dark-browed woman who, in her lonely labor, toiled hopefully through love of him. No- thing but her strong woman's trust in him, which he dared not break; nothing but the all-absorbing devotion which had made her life seem no sacrifice! The inward voice which proclaimed him coward and recreant would not be stifled, long after he had plung- ed blindly into the act which seemed most guilty of all his worthless manhood. Once removed from the strong influence which, in the presence of Janet, had been powerful in holding him under its pure'and lofty sway, the retrograde path became an easy one. And while he entered into the arduous duties of his profession, rising, by the power of a mighty intellect to fame-thence to his new love, to lay at her feet an homage which he knew to be false, and which she could not and did not appreciate; striving in fierce ex. citements of revenge and lust to drown the whispers of remorse, Janet Somers, poet and artist, toiling in her lonely attic, caught the first glimpse of that future which fate had decreed should be hers. Her triumph, her success, valued but for him, through love of whom the alluring breath of fame had grown faint, found her dejected at his long absence, yet still believing, still trusting in him ; look- ing forward still to the' day when, hearing of her success, he would fly to pour out his love and pride in her fond ear. Happy in herself, her love, her trust, her faith, who could doubt her future? Failing these? Ay, and what then? There was faith and trust, and love deeper yet, because forming the very groundwork of her nature, and which it belonged not to man to destroy. ;i  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7518-00000037"/> CHAPTER XXI. "LOOu round, the wrecks of play behold, Estates dismembered, mortgaged, sold. And dull the film along his dim eye grew."   Tim scenes of Judith's daily life were wretched now  beyond description-her days' spent in feverish excitement, her nights in a despairing watch for the reel- ing step, the hoarse and brutal voice of him who had become to her a sacred trust. Candle in hand, she would descend the stairs, receiving from Brent her trust silent- ly, yet with a deep gratitude which an- swered the look of pity in her eyes. In his sober moods, her father was as kind, as loving, as devoted as ever; but then she shrank from him with a repugnance which she could not conceal. In his help- lessness, -he became to her a sacred charge; in his intervals of reason, an object of aver- sion. Brent never came in; only putting him into her hands and turning away, sa- vagely incensed, and with all the man in him roused to resentment. A deep pity for the suffering girl, with. her pale, tear-stained face, silent and uncomplaining in the-fulfill- ment of her duty, stole into his breast. Hlis patience was well-nigh exhausted when the end came. That scene-how the memory of it haunted all his after-life'l How, in all his visions, for many nights after, he saw the faces of the gamblers, all eager and distorted; some. fluslned and trembling; others, with steady hand and passionless faces, throwing the die. Beardless boys, on- whose sin-stained lips a mother's kiss had scarcely dried; gray-haired men, hard- ened and sin-loving-all now maddening with the wine-cup and the love of play- and, standing out more vividly, the two faces he was there to watch.  Philip, a fierce, defiant despair gathering in his sullen face, his hoarse voice breaking out above the noise of the disputants and- the roar from the streets, his trembling hands poising the box, his dry lips seeking the wine-cup; Powers, calm, cool, composed, leaning care-   lessly forward, his watchful eye following the- movements of Philip, his white hand put out occasionally to the wine at his side, The night wore on, with the play running fearfully high, the betting going on; and the luck all against Grant. It is a fearful chance; even the idlest of the lookers-on feel this; and the groups gather around them. Powers pushed back his chair, and says he will play no more. Grant urges him, and, Powers still refusing, dashes the box from his hand, and, mad with passion and drink, flings in his teeth the taunt that he has stopped, a winner. For a few seconds the tumult is hushed, and Powers, with whitening lips, steps to the table and raises the box. Amid a breathless silence, the game is renewed. Brent remembers afterward all the details of the revolting picture-the eager faces, seen through the smoke, with all the man dying out in them, with the cries from the street coming. faintly through the closed doors; the sleepy door-keeper gliding in and . out-and, after a long half-hour, remembers Grant standing there, with his heavy, rigid jaw, his crimsoned face; hears through all a stir, and, losing the words which follow, sees him raise, with 'shaking hand, the heavy decanter, and, pouring the liquor into a glass, fling it full in the face of Stanley Powers. The crowd fell back, and they are left alone within a few feet of each other, the two faces almost touching, the eyes glaring at one another. It was only for an instant. Powers turned, looked into the faces gathered about them, dashed, with a tremulous hand, the wine-drops from his face, and raised his arm to strike. But Brent had bounded for- ward, and, in a voice hoarse with agitation, cried: "His daughter! For her sake, if you be a man, let it pass." One glance of those flashing eyes, and   Brent never forgot the malignant fury that swept, for once uncontrolled, over that calm mask. The veins on his high, white, polish- ed brow grew knotted, the lips were drawn tightly over -the teeth, and his clinched fist was again raised to strike. But One mightier than he had inflicted the blow. Philip, sobered in an instant after his mad attack on Powers, had recoiled, and awaited, in sullen silence, the issue. Nothing but blood could wipe opt the stain! All the consequences of the act rushed over him; and, at the mention of his daughter, the blood rushed heavily to heart and brain, and, with a deep groan, he fell senseless to the floor. In an instant, Brent had raised him, and, was tearing away his cravat and vest. LHe placed his hand for a moment over his heart. It was quite pulseless]; and Brent raised his pale, awe-struck face, ex- claiming, "He is dead-quite dead! Poor Judith I poor girl!" Powers raised his trembling hand to wipe the moisture from his brow, gazed for an instant on the ghast- ly face and widely staring eyes, blinded now with the death-film, and went out into the street.  . - One by one the lookers-on in that fearful. scene of the drama of life left the room, and Brent was left with his terrible burden alone under the flashing gas-lights, in the reeking atmosphere.  The door-keeper had put in his head, calling out "Carriage!" twice be- i fore he moved. Alone, again, through the i darkened streets; alone at Judith's door, with his hideous burden. The watchman came at his beck, took the i dead man in his arms, while Brent staggered  blindly up the stairs and rang. He heard N her coming quickly down the stairs, saw the v opening door, and Judith's pale face looking a out at him. The caondle she held flared over I her, standing there shivering with the night v air, and with perhaps a terrible dread as her g eye wandered over his hueless face. In vain b he essayed to speak. His lips moved, but a no sound came. With a sharp, convulsive e movement, she seized his arm, crying:   M "You aie alone; and my father-where   M is he?"                 i( Brent, with a groan, shrank back, cover- M ing his face with his hands. How could' his a brave heart look upon her misery?   The h watchman muttered pityingly:   t  "Here, ma'amn  God help you!" i  God help her, indeed, as she struggled out blindly to his side, wrapping her arms about i him, and sobbing wildly, "My father I my father I It can not be true." They bore him up the stairs and into the house. Then Brent went below, and left her in her sorrow, alone with her dead. To and fro he paced through the long hours that intervened before the gray dawn crept chillingly in. Once again then he sought her. She still lay with her face pillowed against his, tearless, motionless, her heavy eyelids drooping on her pallid cheek-a touching picture of woe. He bent over her, spoke a few words that were intended to comfort her, and left the house, first to seek Elinor, then to make arrangements for the interment. In Elinor's arms, Judith at length found voice to mourn her loss, crying wildly for help, soothed at last with the gentle sympa- thy which none other knew so well how to afford. The few hours which yet remained to her were spent beside him, and before they bore him from her, she had become quite calm. Left once more alone, at her own request, she threw herself down in the dusky light of the solemn room, holy to her now for every memory of the past. Here they had lived and loved, through all her young life, for each other, knowing nor caring for any thing beyond. Lying quietly now, thinking of all this, and anon following'the slow pro- cession that wound down the street bear- ing from her her sole earthly protector, the one who had been every thing to her, she would not, dared not think of the few past wretched months. How it had all come about she had never paused to think. That Powers had been in some way connected with her father's death she had vaguely gathered from the comments of those around her, and this, now growing more prominent as the first shock of- her grief wore off, add- ed a new pang to her misery. Still dwelling with feverish anxiety upon a theme so fraught with fresh terrors to her, she listened anx- iously for Brent's return. She knew  he would come back to her when all was over; and then, for the first time, remembering all his kindness, his tender thought for her, she wept quietly. Her first thought of Powers  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7518-00000038"/> was one of bitter resentment, but gradually this feeling gave place to one of pain. Her haughty spirit found some excuse for the man who, even for love of the daughter, would not brook insult from the father. All the woman in her heart plead for him. There was no hope now, even if he loved her, and how could she think otherwise? Life seemed so dreary, and, shuddering with a sense of cold, and gloom, and wretchedness, she sank back upon the cushions of her lounge in a paroxysm of weeping. In the midst of all this Brent returned. He stood beside her for a few moments without speaking, look- ing pityingly upon a sorrow so passionate that it stirred his strong spirit to its depths. He crossed the room noiselessly, rang for lights, ordered the fire ffiade, and tea brought for Miss Grant. He put a shade over the light, subduing its glare, mixed her tea and brought it over to her. She shook her head and continued weeping piteously. "Drink it, Miss Grant, and try to com- pose yourself," he said gently.' "L I wish to speak with you, and can not while, you are in such a state."      r Hie exercised a strong influence over her, weak and nervous as she was, and, touched by his solicitude, she drank the tea, shiver- ,ing and moaning the while. He left the room, returning with her furred cloak, which he wrapped tenderly around her. After some time she became calmer, and Brent paced the room patiently until her agitation had quite subsided; then, in low tones, full of compassion, he told her of all, saying nothing, however, of his belief in Stanley's guilt; nothing either of his own watchful guardianship through those weary months- ,a watch that had kept him amid scenes for which he had a strong repugnance, and, more than all, had kept him from the side of his mistress. She listened to his simple recital, listened eagerly to all which con- nected Powers with her father's death, lis- tened and heard, without a hope, Brent's re- cital, and knew he could never be any thing to her now.  Long after he had ceased speaking she sat buried in silent thought. He hated to break in upon her quietude, yet he said: "Miss Grant, have you thought of what you will do in the future?" With a start she looked hastily around   the'room, saying: "I shall remain here, of course; not alone, but perhaps with Ra- chel." She had never dreamed, then, of the pos- sibility that her home must be given up. He hesitated how to convey to her his fears, that with her father's deaths had come per- haps poverty. He thought, too, looking upon her regal beauty, of her pride, her luxurious tastes, her antipathy to any thing savoring of poverty, and sighed as he said' "Miss Grant, I am afraid you do not guess my fear--that your home must be given up. Your father's fortune has sustained many serious losses latterly, and-" She interrupted him with a piteous ges- ture. "That too!" she murmured: "I un- derstand you, Mr. Brent. I am a beggar 1" she continued bitterly., "God forbid!" he said gravely; " matters can hardly be so bad. -I wished you not to be disappointed if things were at their worst." She had arisen and was walking the floor rapidly; suddenly she paused before him: "Mr. Brent, I can not give up this place- my home-this room,". she continued qui- veringly. "Send for Rachel, and let them take Pine Ridge and all else, but not; this." He looked at her kindly. "Miss Grant, I am afraid you still do not understand the extent of your misfortune. All must go. Perhaps enough will be left for a support. The creditors may be willing, in considera- tion of ybur--" She turned suddenly, flashing upon him her haughty eyes, and crying: "Would you have me owe any thing to their charity?" He was not angry with her, he pitied her too much. "If you will bring me all of your father's papers, I will look over them and endeavor to ascertain the extent of his liabilities. Perhaps things are not so bad as I fear." "No, no-not to-nighti I will not tax your kindness further at present." "I shall not sleep, and shall remain here. Let me have the papers, and then, if you think I have been kind, oblige me by seek- ing some rest yourself." She unlocked the secretary and laid the papers before him. He lighted her candle and gravely accompanied her up the: stairs   and through the hall to her bedroom door. At the door she turned, took the light from his hand, and faltered, while her lips trem- bled and the tears dropped slowly down her cheeks: "Mr. BWent, I can not thank you for all your kindness, though I know more than you think." He stopped her, saying quietly: "Say no more, my dear young lady. I only wish my assistance could have been of more avail." "God bless you!" she whispered, and, stooping suddenly, touched his hand with her lips. It was a hard, rough hand, more fitted to the sports which gave health and strength to his vigorous frame than to a lady's caress. In her gratitude to him, in her im- pulsive freedom, she had left the impress of her hot lips on it; and slowly descending the stairs, he looked curiously upon it with a half smile about his mouth. A woman's kiss! What did he know of   it? His gay boyhood, his fresh manhood had been under the strong, pure influence which would go with him through life. This thought led himn off on a tack which brought his mistress before him, and thereupon he resolved to see her on the morrow.  So thinking, he reached the library, and then, banishing even Janet, gave himself up to his work for the poor orphan overhead. She would not sleep, he knew, under her grief, but he had placed a hard, worldly consideration against a real, passionate grief, that was, he knew, almost too strong for her to battle with. All through the long night he sat poring over the papers, finding only repeated confirmation of his worst fears, re- 'volving in his mind endless schemes for her relief, and so wearing away the hours in seeking to solve a problem-which fate kind- ly took up and unraveled for him and her!  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7518-00000039"/> CHAPTER XXII. "A TRUER, nobler, trustier heart, More loving, or more loyal, never beat Within a human breast." BYRON.   THE morrow found Brent still engaged, and involved in hopeless perplexity. Shrinking from the pain he must inflict upon Judith, he yet stated to her without reservation the truth. She was indeed, as she had bitterly termed it, little better than a beggar. Rejecting all the plans which' he proposed, she obstinately refused to alter the intention which she had formed during the night. ( I will never live with any one. I have some skill with my pencil; I'will try that. If it fail, surely there is some method by which an honest livelihood may be gained." He smiled sadly. "You must allow, me to judge for you, Miss Grant. Let me write to Mrs. Harleigh. She is attached to you, and will be able, probably, to suggest some plan which will meet your approval." "You are mistaken, I think. There are none to care for me now," she faltered. It was a difficult case to manage; and Brent finally determined to write on his own responsibility to Mrs. Harleigh, which he accordingly did. The reply did not de- ceive him in her: "My whole life shall be devoted to her if she so will it. I am, like her, alone in the world." Perhaps the future has comfort in store for both. We will test it, God willing. "I will not write to her, as I follow this immediately. She can not send me back, once with her." Neither did she wish it. Touched'beyond measure by a sympathy and kindness so unlooked for, Judith's proud spirit was subdued. She wept pas- sionately in Rachel's close embrace; and a stronger bond was drawn between them than could ever have been under other cir- cumstances. Ah! what a leveler of human pride, what a bond of sympathy is grief! Rachel was happier now in her widowhood,   with the sweet, tender mother-love making her heart glad, her spirit bright, than she had ever dared to hope. Perhaps now she looked forward to some distant-future in which her grief for the father, tempered by time, the daughter might lend an ear to the mother's wrongs. The days which Brent had vowed to Judith's service were spent in anxious thought, in long hours given to legal consultation, in the 'painful fulfillment of his self-imposed duty. He attended to all that would spare her unnecessary trouble; and Judith found herself poor indeed, yet not without a home, which her pride found miserable enough. Her few friends were true enough to her in her fallen fortunes, and her heart should have rebuked her for her discontent. Hers was no nature to bear cheerfully with. want, hardship, or neglect; and nei- ther the care of Brent, the endearments of Rachel, nor the earnest sympathy and kind- ness of Elinor could soften her into submis- sion. To the latter she clung with a warmth of gratitude and devotion which belonged to her nature. To Elinor alone could her proud spirit whisper of the pain, the fierce conflict, the natural yet false humiliation she felt. In her sorrows, so truthfully ex- pressed, so candidly avowed, Elinor had learned a strong attachment for her. She could not feel otherwise toward one whose very faults sprung from an excess of the most generous emotions. Underlying all was a candor, an honesty, an unselfish, generous warmth which eli- cited esteem and plead strongly in her favor. Day by day the tie between them was growing stronger. Day by day the influ- ence of Elinor's pure characteristics, her high-minded, womanly principle, was win- ning a deeper hold over the passionate, way. ward nature of her young friend. She as   yet was ignorant of the higher laws which governed Elinor's life; yet a love for the teacher was fast awakening her mind to something better than feeling, more endur- ing, and better worth loving. Elinor, in her happy home, with all her rare endowments of intellect, her powers of pleasing-giving herself up to her humble duties to husband and children and to her household, forgetful of self, and with an ever-ready sympathy for the trials and temptations which, without touching her own life, she could thoroughly appreciate- was a better lesson to her discontent than the most learned homily. She who looked upon the trifling details 0f every-day life with contempt; who, regardless of the less- er and humbler duties of her existence, was looking eagerly abroad for something wor- thy of endurance and triumph, could not be suddenly brought to admit the necessity of small beginnings. It was a lesson which must be brought before her. after trial and disappointment, bitterness and doubting, which would wring her nature to its core. For a while we leave her chafing under her. hard burden, restless with unexpressed desires for something grand and worthy of herself, yet with a deeper lesson in the un- conscious teachings of Elinor's beautiful life than she is aware of. Brent was free at last I Free to seek the side of her he loved, to bask once more in her presence, to feel to the full all the con. tentment which it brought him: In all the absorption of business he had not been unmindful of her; and now, with the first bright look his face had wore in many months, he sought her out. No evi- dences in her outer life marked the change from hope to a dread uncertainty, more tor- turing than the direst despair. Despair in its literal meaning, its accepted sense, could never be hers. Beyond the giving up of human hope lay a higher stake, which must be won, too, through human exertion and illman feeling. Scarcely a thought of Brent had entered her mind during the weary days which had yet brought the first fruits of her laborious life. First fruits of fame, pleasant as the sought-for end of all honorable emulation must be, yet how t tasteless compared to what she had once E   X dreamed of such an hour I Once she had meant to lay it before him; the first step won in that race, whose end was to be a ' share in his love, his pride, his ambition. Hers was not the weak courage which would  renounce all for one failure. The'volume lay before her now, and pleading in her ear ! were the strong voices that spoke to her of that future which, with strength and will, and a trust unfaltering, must be hers. She had glanced up expectantly at the sound of a footstep, and the smile did not die away from her face as she rose and put her hand in his. At no time in her life had she cared so little, perhaps, for the sight of any face not ais; yet she soon grew inter- ested in Brent, and forgot for the time any thing but the pleasure she had learned to take in his honest face, his plodding truth, that worked its way so boldly through all the sophisms which perplexed keener-mind- ed men; and she listened with deep feeling to his recital of Judith's trouble, entering, as he could not, into the effect which re- verses of such a nature would probably have upon her character. Brent had come with no intention beyond the pleasure which he felt in being with her, but it seemed impos- sible, in the joy of sitting by her side- watching the shadows play over her strange. ly attractive face-feeling all through him the thrill of her dark eyes, not to say that which he had been so long struggling to keep from her-that he loved her beyond every thing in the world. With a love that made all belonging to her seem better and brighter, and more worth living for, that guarded secret was shining out from the depths of his quiet yet passionate nature, and made his heart beat and his pulse thrill; changed his simple na- ture to something worth all the mere ro- mance of sentiment in the world-made him dumb upon the one theme upon which he most wished to prove eloquent; and -so, af- ter months of self-denial and restraint, months of patient waiting, with the eyes he loved best looking into his, the voice he loved best sounding in his ears, the being worthy of his worship stirring all the poe- try of his nature into action; with the win- ter's sunshine dying out of the day, and the shadows stretching far!out over all, Nevil  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7518-00000040"/> Brent found voice' to tell his love. To this woman his every simple word spoke the truth of his devotion, and she listened rev- erently, painfully, to the avowal that to her, above all other women, he had given all that was most worthy in his nature. To her keeping he had given the holiest trust a wo- man can accept-a man's first, best affec- tion. A trust which such a woman would accept humbly or reject gratefully. To Janet, whose heart quailed before the task which had come to her unsought-almost undreamed of-it made all the woman with- in her grow cowardly. No woman can listen unmoved to the avowal of a man's affection for her, least of all when that avowal treads upon the cold- ness and neglect of one who has awakened all the tenderness of her nature.. Turning, with a half yearning, tot one who brought so sweet a comfort to her, her heart touched by a love so entirely given to herself, she cast 'one thought-perhaps only a half thought-to the possibility of a future link- ed to the kind, honest nature before her; a future which promised rest and content- ment and a watchful guardianship over her isolated life, happiness to him, rest and con- tentment to her. It could scarcely be de- fined as a thought, for his voice had scarcely ceased before he heard his fate from the lips which made pain less hard to bear; learned that henceforth he must go through life with one joy the less, one grief the more, yet stronger and better for having known a love so worthy. Without a hope, without a word, he heard her through]; held, for one instant, the slender, dark hand she extended, to his white lips; turned his own eyes from the pity in hers, and left her alone. In passing the door he started, as Janet's picture, her shrouded mystery, her inspiration, met his eye. The canvas stood uncovered. The purple tents, the streaming banners flaunted before his eyes, while he, like Powers, saw, in. the vivid likeness of the woman before him, not the Hebrew matron, bent on her sacrificial purpose, but his Janet I All the force of the picture struck him; not in the grand limning to which her noble thought had given birth, not in the foreshadowing of a power to command his reverence, but a terribly distinct portrayal of unwomanly   passion. The jeweled brow, the purple robe, clothing the form he loved, in the shameless trappings of her unwomanly er- rand, sickened him. Janet had watched its effect upon him, read every change in his countenance. To what could a union with him have led her? Hoping now that the impression he carried of her would work its cure, she saw him pause, glance shudderingly from the picture to her,'then, passing rapidly to her side, he said eagerly: "You must efface it, Janet. It is unjust, unwomanly, therefore unlike." She smiled sadly. "You shall never see it-agaiin, Brent. Forget it, if you can. It is not the only thing upon which we would differ." The contrast then between his nature and hers came more strongly over her. He was too humble about himself to be pained. He had never hoped or wished to understand her; had only cared to love her ignorantly, blindly, and because it made his happiness, without his knowing why or wherefore. So these two parted: she, to put this among the highly prized memories of her life, valued and cherished; he, to go through the world, his unimpressible nature first awakened by it to some knowledge of itself. No outward token evinced his disappoint- ment; yet when he passed into the cold air, the darkening street, looking into familiar faces, exchanging the clasp of friendly hands, there was neither beauty, nor peace, nor warmth in all the world for him. Later on, mingling in the sports, the toil, the occupa- tions of his healthful life, was the memory of his unrequited love, passing through and tincturing all the events of his seemingly prosaic life. To the influence of the one real passion every life owes its after-current of good or evil, strength or weakness. Other passions may come into play, other events sweep over us in the onward march of time; yet, true as the needle to the pole, that one passion directs us in our career. Human passions and human feelings are swayed by the tide of human events; yet the path of our destiny rests upon the failure or success of the one passion without which no human life is perfect.   CHAPTER XXIII. "NHT, sable goddess, from her ebon throne, In rayless majesty now stretches forth Her leaden sceptre o'er a slumbering world. And thus, in nature's solitude, he nursed his grief."   THE slow winter had passed away, and Brent had never lost sight of Janet, never relaxed his unobtrusive, watchful guardian- ship over her. Of Judith he had scarcely thought. In the twilight of the early spring evening he stood on the pier, looking out absently over the river, watching the craft go gliding by. The heavy-rigged vessels, the light-draught steamers, the trimly built lug- gers, the noisy wherries plying to and fro, the small canoes darting in and out among the shipping, the shrill cries of the newsboys, the hoarse piping of deck-hands-what a busy, active life lay all around him I and, in listless apathy, he stood looking on. The dusk deepens, and the white mist creeps softly up over the river; the bustle and noise recede into the heart of the city; the dark mass of water-craft lies silent and motionless; the stars overhead grow more and more distinct; and Brent, stooping over, loosens the cable of his little boat, and, step- ping in, takes the sculls in hand, and glides out from among the shipping. A half-dozen vigorous pulls of his flashing oar-blades, and the little bark stems the strong current amid- stream.. Steadily on, with her prow north- ward, she moves past Canal street, beyond the tower of St. Patrick's, above Felicity road. The city lamps are growing more faint, and still the solitary figure sways back- ward and, forward, now, with a sudden sweep, sending the little bark forward, with  her prow skimming the waves, then pausing,  with a quiver from stem to stern, a long rip- 1 ple of light in her wake; and so on, until 1 the river sweeps broadly around. Grenville t woods loom up darkly on the shore; Carroll-  ton Gardens are left behind; and now;. more E quietly, he plies the sculls in the quiet c country.. A straggling light, an open field, I   a clump of trees, the barking of dogs, the hoot of an owl, the hoarse murmur of the river, the fitful water-breeze, drifting by with the 'olling mist-and the great city lies far in the rear, her spires barely visible where the river bends. The muscular arms are folded across his breast, the oars trail loosely in the water, and Brent gives himself up to the calm enjoyment of rest. It is scarcely more to him.  Thought rarely shapes itself palpably; and, save in the rare moments when action arouses him, there is rather an absence of thought than otherwise; an indifference to outward things, which betrayed itself in the absent gaze of his deep-blue eye, the listless apathy of his manner. Wrapping his heavy boat-cloak about him, he lights a cigar, and, stepping over the seat, throws himself down in the stern. The boat drifts nearer in to the shore, veers slowly round, and drops down with the current. The stars overhead have shifted, and show that the hours are wearing far into the night. The straggling lights have disappeared from the farm-houses, and all is silent, save the lapsing of the water under the prow of the little boat. Hours were spent in floating down the tide, and the mist hung thick and white over the river before the city was reached. He had resumed his oars and steered in toward the shore, at the foot of Felicity road. All dark up the narrow street, and Brent paused un- der the shadow of the bank. Close down to the wateri edge, a shawl wrapped about her, her hands holding it tightly to her throat, her face turned away from him in profile, was Judith. For some moments he sat watching her. What could she be doing out on the river, so far from home, at that hour of the night? He had never seen her   &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7518-00000041"/> but once in her poverty. It had. made her prouder and harder to bear with, and he had not cared to intrude upon her. That once he had seen her across the street, walking in her old, rapid fashion, her drawing-book under her arm; had seen her turn, with a haughty gesture of impatience, from the re- cognition of a group of her once fashionable friends, and, the moment after, saw her dash her hand over her white face, with such a bitter misery on it that he had turned away in pain. In all the while he looked upon her, she had never turned or moved. Her beautiful, pale face, in its faultless ivory moulding, with the moonlight shining on it and far down-into her cold eyesi told all. No need to say that she was miserable; that, in her pride, she was waging a struggle in which she was powerless.. Misery!. What but that had driven him out on his lonely night- ride over the water 1 Misery I Yes, it had led her there, to the river-bank, perhaps, in her desperation, to do--what? Stepping over the boat's edge, he gained the bank and stood beside her. She never started or attempted to conceal her features, only turned her white face toward him and looked sullenly into his eyes. "Judith, what madness is this-why are you here?" "Why am I here?" she cried sharply; ",why am I here? Because I suffer less; because I can not bear to be still. Is that reason enough? or shall I tell you all? of insults and taunts and struggles. that gall my pride and send me home to-a wretched, sleepless bed? Is it enough?" she cried bit- terly. "It is better than I thought," he said, with a half shudder. "Youthought I had come for that I No, I dare not T T am a coward. I. seek the open air because I can not remain in doors; but I am not quite mad or desperate." "And this is-"- "Every night," she broke irf "For how long, Nevil Brent, how long?" She had caught his arm, and the tears were raining over her cold face. "Poor Judith," he said 'tenderly; '" are things so bad?"- "'Brent," she gasped, "H can not bear   it. I can not be taunted, be looked coldly on. Poverty chills me, hardens me. I could feel tenderly once and kindly; but now I turn savage at the sight of misery. There is no future for me, nothing, nothing." He had drawn nearer to her, and, putting his arm kindly about her, bore her down the bank and into the boat. His playmate; he remembered the little beauty of years ago, with her flashing eyes and scarlet lips, her imperious gestures and haughty temper. He remembered their meeting six-months ago in the pines on the old bridge-the bright, laughing face in all its bloom, with the witchery of the soft eyes upon himT-and he could not. smile at her wretchedness, child- ish as it might seem to others. ,Perhaps his own weakness made him lenient. She had clung to him, shivering with the cold of the night air, and he put her in the stern, wrap- ping his boat-cloak around her, and seated himself beside her. How unquestioningly she trusted him They were both silent now, and she soon grew calm under the lull- ing motion of the boat, and lay passively watching the receding shore. For a long while he remained holding her to him with one arm about her; and as she lay there on his breast, what thoughts were busy within him? Perhaps he was scarcely conscious even when he spoke. "Judith, I can spare you all this; will you be my wife?"He spoke very quietly, and Judith thought she must be dreaming. Where was Janet? And she, could she marry him, loving another? how hopelessly she knew; and here, indeed, lay all the se- cret of that grief which found vent in bitter invective, in ceaseless complaining, She could not bear to tell him of her hopeless love; but could she bear her future either? In the few moments she had lain in his arns she had felt so peaceful, so. full of rest. Perhaps he would be generous, and not ask more than her duty as a wife. One linger- ing hope in Powers had saved her; but his long silence at such a time could notibe mis- construed. A"Brent," she said slowly, "I can not be your wife, though I thank you from my heart. You have been most kind and gene- rous through all, and that is why I will not pain you or deceive; I could not marry you,   loving another." The last words had been spoken in almost a whisper, while the crim- son blush of shame swept over her face. "And that other?" he said. "Can never marry me," she said quickly, drawing away from  his encircling arm. "Spare me, Nevil, I can say no more." "I shall respect your secret," he said gravely. For a few moments he remained silent,' dipping' the oars regularly in and sending the water eddying away; then he said:  "Judith, perhaps I too have a confession to make." He paused an instant, then re- sumed: "I too love another, and have found how hard it is to bear such a disappoint- ment. I am man enough, I believe, to bury its memory for the future, and be true to you if you will let me. If we do not love each other now, perhaps it will come in time: shall we try it?" For one long, breathless moment she thought: How carve her future in her igno- rance? There was much to love in this man, much to admire, seeing him only as she had done in the occasional moments where the deeper feelings had quickened him into energetic life. She thought nothing of the plain strata that lay above all, this, and through which she must delve to reach the gold. Alas! how much of the romance which pertains to every nature must melt at the approach of daily intercourse I He did not press the matter. It was bet. ter that she should think well of it now. His forbearance in this instance, perhaps too, partly deceived her. She could trust to one who showed himself so lenient, so for- bearing! How could she guess that harsh-  ness and pride would arouse the iron resist- ance in his nature? that suspicion and re- sentment would make him sullen and re-  sentful? Nearing now the pier, he steers in shoreward, and Judith puts her cold hand  in his and whispers, "We will try it, Nevil." And he draws her closer to him until he feels her heart throbbing wildly, little guess-  ing that, even as she spoke, it had leapt in wild rebellion at the decree; that she was t thinking, half despairingly, of what her fu-  ture is to be linked with his. The boat is 1 fastened, and in the gray, morning light the j two make their way home. Reaching the a   door, she fits the key with a trembling hand, and Brent bends toward her, holding her hands tenderly between his own, and touches her brow with his lips-all this in a grave, brotherly fashion, with little of a lover's im- petuosity; yet Judith shudders, and a sick- ening loathing runs through her frame. . It waseasier then to bear than it became months afterward, as the time forthe fulfill- ment of their compact drew nigh. Ah - if this had been the close of that eventful day, but it was not to be. Returning from her labor with aching heart and throbbing brow, she threw herself-down on her couch in bit- terest thought and self-reproach. Weeping in an agony of grief for her weak promise, she -heard a quiet step, raised her head, and saw Powers looking down upon her. He was pale from recent illness, and wore an air. of subdued sadness which well became him.. "Judith," he said tremulously, "I have- at last found courage to face you. Say yom forgive me. Say you do not hate me, i have lost all hope of winning your love, but; say not your forgiveness." His low, tender voice, subdued with all the passionate me-. lancholy of his theme, stole ito her poor' bruised heart like veriest music. "O Stanley I1 she cried, "what have you: done? For love of me you might have borne  with him." He did not seek to extenuate himself, only still kneeling beside her- drooping form, his. head bowed, his face turned away from her. She was touched by his attitude, his ap- pearance of sorrow, and leaning forward: whispered, "I haye forgiven you, Stanley." A bright light shone in his cold eyes, and leaning-forward he put his arm around her, drawing her to him until her head rested on his shoulder, crying, "You love me, Judith; say if I deceive myself." For an instant she lay close to his heart, and he pressed his lips to her shining hair, that lay in disorder on her hot cheeks. "Alas!" he cried, "from what happiness, my own rash act has shut me out!" "What can you mean?" she faltered;: then, looking up into his eyes and catching his meaning, she sprang with a wild cry to- his breast. "You can not mean it, Stanley; you can not mean it. Why cheat me with, a hope too sweet if false? Cruel, cruel!"  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7518-00000042"/> Dissembler 7though he was, his heart quailed before-th6eouthurst of her untu- ltoied, passionate heart. Soothing her, he gently seated her," and placing himself beside her said!"Judith, you know little of the world itf you dream it could sanction your love foi me now. 'If my unworthy love has found' an echo in your breast, it can only be to us a cherished memory to bear through life, each perhaps better and" purer for its sake: I am not cowardly -enough to take advantage-of your ignorance and youth. We mnistpart now forever, each going through life with the secret of our grief, each' com- -foried with the belief:that love is mightier thahn death." She- had listened to him in a dumb'l de- tspair. She knew he spoke the truth. It was very sweet to her to believe that he 'oved her,' even if that love was hopeless. She was a woman, and ought to love on, -though hope was denied her, and be better :and stronger than without it. She ought to   accept any fate which he might share ever so remotely with her. This and much more she sobbed brokenly in his ear, with his arms about her, his cheek against hers. Suddenly the remembrance of her own promise came back to her, and starting from his embrace, ashe gasped: ';Too late, too late; I am to be his wife." She had fallen back insensible, and Powers, looking upon her, thought how beautiful she was even in her deep abandonment of grief. But he had had enough of such a scene, and he passed out into the dimly lighted street; wrapping his cloak closely around him and pushing-his hat down over his eyes. He had only meant to ask her forgiveness, and he had been led into much more, and he felt heartily ashamed of his heartlessness. But it was an influence which he could never re- sist. He made a firm resolution now to see her no more until time and her new ties had obliterated the past And he saw her no more until she was Nevil Brent's wife.   CHAPTER XXIV. "IN the fountain of my heart a seal Is set, to keep its waters pure and bright For thee."          SIELUY.   THaE cool breeze of a spring evening blew freshy from the lake, and, sweeping across the level country, made its way through the long streets, whirling around the corners, and making the gay groups of pedestrians driaw their cloaks more closely around them, whiie through many an open shutter the crimson firelight flickered out into the street, and the gas-lights flashed and flared upon the passer-by. Up one street and down, another, until we reach Janet's abode, and we follow the man of letters in his ascent tiup the narrow, crook- ed stairs and into her studio. We pause with him, looking through the half-open door. It is dusk within the room, but the western windows are all aglow with the crimson flush of the dying day, and in the clear- western light Janet stands, her dark profile distinctly traced against the bare window. She is the Janet of some months ago: the face, if less hopeful, is still serene; the- mouth betrays, in its calm relaxation, neither weariness nor despair; the eyes, shining with the glow from the westering light, are peaceful; the slender fingers are resting quietly clasping her bosom. It baf- fles him now;- that perfect repose, that dark, soul-lit face baffles him as when he stood before her months ago seeking to penetrate its secret 1 He has come now with a deeper interest than idle curiosity to read the riddle, and, advancing noiselessly to her side, lays a hand upon, her shoulder and speaks: "Janet 1" Quickly she turns at his voice: "My friend." And a smile full of pleasure, that lights all that dark face like a sunbeam, breaks forth. It was much to be called friend by such a woman; and as he clasps both her slender hands in his, his own thrill as the lissom fingers close over them. For more than a an ,   minute neither spoke; then, with words which, without hearing, yet penetrated all through him with a renewed sense of her strange power, she led him forward until, seated in her easy-chair, she placed herself beside him. The flickering firelight played over the roon, unchanged in all respects as when, months before, it had played over her kneeling form at Stanley's feet, with her eager eyes looking into his and .listening to the tale he poured into her ears. Of the passion that had made life beautiful, that had lingered when the flush of hope had paled, that had warmed her soul and leaped to her pen, this man, with a quick discern- ment /had learned something through that pen; of the grander heroism which had tinc- tured all her life--grander even than passion, too noble for despair-he had yet to learn. There was much in common upon which these two might dwell; much that pertained neither to passion nor sentiment, yet which, appealing to both in rich fancy,'in cultivated thought, might,-have led th it.* He held in his hand an' edition of her poems, edited by himself, and the once re- jected manuscripts were brought by Janet and laid by his side, while the man of a genius too profound for unjust criticism lent him- self to the task which found a charm for him with her dark face beside him; and in the questioning look she turned upon him, the half flush of her cheek, the lustre of her eye, lay a strong temptation to linger over his task.' It was a charm that had come to him long ago, when he had seen through all the wild vagaries of fancy the power of true genius that grasped her pen. From admira- tion of the genius he had come to a know-, ledge of the woman in her humble home, following out in all simplicity the thread of her destiny, the silver thread running through all the sombre hue of the woof I  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7518-00000043"/> He had seen all this, and believing, as I do, that from such a sympathy of natures there follows one result, you will see that there was a tie now greater than interest in her literary career that had sprung up in his breast.  ' Knowing all the power and passion of pa- thos-following out the most profound the- ories of an ideal existence- he had over- stepped all the prosaic details of his profes- sion; had summed up all the hidden rob mance of his bygone, youth, and had lived through months in an abstraction -from which he awakened to a realization of the truth. Words could poorly express how his existence :had, warmed and brightened and deepened,until the-passion he had once deprecated from fier pen stole into his heart and taugh{him a love the strongest and truest and tenderest which it belonged to him to feel. And it was through the poor medium of words that he had come to make her feel somewhat of this passion. Can you marvel that his great, calm -eyes, out of which his soul once smiled serenely, should grow troubled under the gaze, she turned upon him? that the slender fingers closing over his should make his pulse grow quick? The form that was flitting. to and fro be- tween him and the light was woven with every tender sympathy of- his strong man- hood., The smile :that played upon her lip, the grace that lingered with every movement' as she moved from fire to table,- preparing her simple evening meal, all belonged to his future; and leaning his head back, he fixed an abstracted gaze upon her, losing nothing of the present, yet wandering in a rapt dream of the future, in which he should glide through all the phases of his profes- sional life with her at his side. He could look upon her with such a feel- ing of rest, a content so great, so hopeful; a dream from which *he was roused to find her smiling before him, half- standing, half leaning, with- one. hand resting upon his chair, the other pointing to his:tea' "Bring it to me,.Janet.". And she brought it, stir- red, and put the cup in his hand. He took it ,from her, idly stirring it with his spoon, while she moved back and sat down under the lamp-light to drink her own. She was neither young nor pretty, but something   better than either; and so'he thought, look- ing upon her, reader, as you or I can not. Silent through all, she saw nothing at, which to marvel in the silence of a man of letters; yet, later on in her humility, she read nothing of the secret that followed her, looking out from his eyes; nothing until, in the waning night, with the crimson firelight dying out in the grate, with the mellow light from the overhanging lamp, with the pale stars keeping their serene watch through her chamber windows, with the dying away of the -deep roar! of the life that dwelt in its noisy toil about them, not till then did the child of genius know that the secret of an- other life was given into her keeping. - The words which broke forth a moment later, stealing through the silence, were hardly needed. "Janet, mind and heart and soul cry unto thee; let me not de- spair 1"V Until that moment, until the deep, torturing need of that-great human heart made itself known -to her, she had scarcely realized the desolation of her own. Now, in that revelation,.he became more than ever a, friend to her -one for whom her- heart cried out in its great and bitter sorrow. Kneeling before him, clasping his hands in hers, her dark eyes looking into his, her sweet face aglow with something that was more than a reflection of his own; with her pale -lips tremulous, her slight form bowing itself before him, she poured into his ear all the passion, the power, the grandeur of her desolate life, until his heart, too, throbbed and his pulse quickened -quickened with the heroism of her own being; and the pain of his disappointment, while it grew deeper, became less bitter. "Despair," she said at length, "belongs neither to your life nor to mine. Disap- pointment is not always bitter. My friend, you alone are now a sharer of my secret thoughts. To you alone is the passion of my life made known. To my calm exist ence has belonged the strife of human love and human'weakness. Look with me upon my inspiration!"  Both had risen; and Janet, reaching forth her hand, had put the covering from her canvas, and they looked together upon. the one evidence of the artist power that lay -latent within her. It needed no morel - The   prostrate- figure of the struggling artist be- fore the senseless marble that portrayed the figure of the mighty genius, the idolatrous worship for all creations of the sublime, all   was before him.

There's tempest 'neath the Waves." . .  ..   THE intervening months had passed away. rapidly enough to Judith; and in the balmy splendor of a June evening she allowed Brent to draw her arm in his, and they wended their way to the Place d'Armes. The mellow light of a full moon bathed the silent square; white and still the statues gleamed through clumps of broken shrub- bery; the hush of solitude and quiet lay all about them, yet the heart of each throbbed tumultuously,./filled with unspoken mur- murs-with the unquiet longings for some release; The morrow was their wedding- day: yet even Brent, looking upon the pale, subdued face of his bride, noting the rest- less glitter of her eyes under which her un- spoken grief had written deep lines; noting, too, the tremor of the little hand that lay So passively on his arm, he sighed, noting all this with quiet, observant eyes. Perhaps his own secret thoughts dis. turbed -him. Perhaps he found how far he had miscalculated his own strength. What- ever may have been the cause, he said noth- ing; and Judith, too, remained silent. One hope, however remote, had given her strength and daring to speak; but to him now only'could she look for the sheltering protection which her nature needed. There was no half-formed wish in her despairing heart to fall at his feet with a, confession of the truth. He had never asked for more than he professed to- give. Perhaps her shrinking was no more than maidenly reserve. How could she say that, even loving him, she could have felt otherwise at such a 'time I Ay, how, indeed I until she learned it in despairing bitterness months after. They -were facing the old cathedral. Grim and dark it rose before them; the moonlight creeping over the walls dim and discolored, and stealing through the stained- glass windows,.   Deep and solemn came pealing forth the evening chimes from its belfry. Listening now, Judithts heart stole back through all her childhood. Scenes almost forgotten, to which its music proved the missing link, came back to her; and the tears, springing from almost unknown causes, quivered in her eyes, and, rolling slowly down her cheek, splashed on the hand of her companion.  The spot where, months ago, she had left the fervent touch of her hot lips, was wet now with her tears. He looked down at it, and a strange, bitter smile hovered over her lip. . Tears on her wedding-eve I As the last peal rang quivering over the arched roof, she slipped her hand from his arm and whispered: "Will you wait for me here? - I would like to go in." He silently disengaged himself from her, and, turning into a by-path, was lost in the shrubbery. Judith followed him with her eye until he disappeared; then, drawing her hood closely over her face, went in. There was no light beyond that of the moon-which lay in broad streaks over the tesselated floor, checkered and stained-and the feeble glimmer of the wax candles burning dimly on the altar. The solemn strains from the organ floated through the aisles, while grouped about the pillars were kneeling forms, whom devotion or some more urgent feeling kept at prayer. There was nothing of religious fervor in Judith's nature; but there was a deep sentiment of poetical en- thusiasm, which was easily aroused by a scene so solemn, sounds so soul-stirring. Her nature was awakened to all the poetry and sentiment of such a worship, and she felt bewildered. Mute and motionless, she leant against a marble column, every sense alive to beauty and worship, looking with awe upon the calm faces of the martyred saints, the passionless yet soulful beauty of the Virgin Mother, whose serene eyes looked   rebuke upon numan- passions; wandering thence to the mystic symbols of a worship of which she knew nothing; upon the image of the crucifixion, she felt a mysterious awe creeping through her, a half terror of her own unworthiness in the divine presence. This then was the real presence of the Di- vinity; she was in the midst of our Saviour and his people I He had promised to be in their amidst, and he was 1 She had never felt it before, and the impression was vivid and lasting. Had the elevation of the Host been observed; had the priests in their robes swept by her, bearing in their hands the body of her Lord, she too would have bowed her head and cried: "Thou art my Lord and my God!" Rousing from her reverie at the dying strains of the organ, she watches the kneel- ing figures rise and depart. The priests leave the altar and disappear into the vestry, the lights are all extinguished save that in the shrine of the Virgin and those in front of the great altar; the silence is complete and unbroken. Judith glides from behind the column and "is about to kneel, when she sees a female form, with face upraised and hands clasped, and, falling back, watches her. The light from the tapers falls on her face, pale and tinged with the uncertain flicker of light, and on a wealth of shining dark hair, while her fingers play over her rosary of glistening silver beads. Can faith and pray- er bring such gladness as-lights the tender eyes?. The whole face seems radiant with love and faith. It is the face of one who has known sorrow and want; yet, kneeling there, among the carved images of her wor- ship, her soul filled with a divine resigna- tion, her heart hushed into happy commu- nion with her Maker, a divine pity for suf- ferings greater than her own, and which her soul daily commemorates, is Janet 1 At length her vigil is over, and she rises, bows herself at the altar, descends the steps of the crimson dais, and advances down the aisle. In an instant Judith starts from her concealment, darts up the aisle, and, flinging herself down in Janet's place, cries: "Oh I give me, too, peace and rest and hope 1' Janet hears the cry, and, gently following, draws the poor, pale face to her bosom, and   says: "Judith, poordithith better such a love than man's--it never fails; better such a trust than man's--it never breaks I' The waters have broken up, the sympathy of sorrow that linked these two together is at work. . Yet when they partel, Janet knew nothing of the real sorrow that had leapt forth in that cry. Judith arose first, calmer only because her sorrow had found some vent. Neither had seen the other for many months, and to both it was a pleasure- to meet.. They sat .down in one of the pews, and question and answer rapidly followed. "You knew the Greys had gone North t" said Judith. "L knew nothing of them," said Janet. "I have not seen Elinor, but I thought noth- ing of it; she has many occupations in her home and children, and I never seek oth- ers."' Judith looked curiously at her. "And you thought her here, and still believed in her friendship?" Janet laughed lightly. "She and I have sworn a friendship, and I trust her more than ever in absence. There are many causes which sometimes prevent even good friends from seeing one another. Only from her own lips will I believe that her trust is broken. You see I love her and trust her entirely." "Do you apply that rule always?" said Judith eagerly. "Could you believe in the affection of another where no word had been plighted, but where eye and heart could never be mute?"  Anxiously she awaited the reply. "No; for I might be mistaken. My own heart might speak, and not theirs, or my wish might falsely interpret; but to doubt the woord of my friend or lover, never!" Ah! if Judith had only possessed her secret, how she might have tortured even that calm, self-reliant nature; but she did not even remotely guess it, and with a half petulant sigh she resumed: "Did Elinor tell you that Isabel was- to be married?" "No," said Janet, with interest. "Yes, I believe as- soon as they return." "To whom?" Judith paused, half doubtful of 4er sIf-  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7518-00000045"/> cointrol; then, in a low voice, said: "lTo Stanley Powers."  ,  Was it the moonlight that flashed so ghastly pale-through the casement on Janet's cheek, that looked so coldly from her eyes-? It was only for sn instant, and before Judith could command her own feelings sufficiently to lotok up, she had risen, cold indeed as the marble pillar against which, she leant, and, wrapping her cloak about her, led the'way out.:' -In:the doorway leant Brent, with folded arms and patient face; yet, when his eyes, sad enough tomove pity, met hers, the ardtst-only smiled .an, icy, bitter smile. He too had proved faithless! Poor,j poor humanityt she had proved its littleness; whs it worth more toil anid patience?, She   knew all the secret now of Judith's tears and hopelessness, but there was no pity in her heart for her when she bent over her and touched hei pale face with her cold lips. Her eyes were stern enough, and Brent shrank remorsefully from their gaze; yet not his faithlessness had had. power to move her, even to a scornful pity. How often is the real author of our misery passed by in a sorrow too deep for words, while upon some chance delinquent lights the burden of our wrrath I To the lesser incidents of- existence belong the fitful-tempests of passionate grief and remorse, while the darker secret lies buried fathom deep, hidden even from our- selves, if that be possible.   CHAPTER XXVI. O MaARRUGE, marriage I what a curse is thine Where hands alone consent and hearts abhor!"   "OOKING upon Brent at the cathedral door, Janet had thought, '"He is untrue to him- self." On the morrow, standing in the dim aisle of St. Patrick's, what a mockery seemed that marriage I Once only Judith seemed roused from her statuesque immobility. Once, when her trembling lips refused to move, her eyes were raised with a half- terrified glance of appeal, a quick flash of despair; then she dropped them, and the service proceeded without interrup- tion to the end. Cold and perfectly calm, she raised her cheek to his salute--wrote, with unfaltering hand, her clear autograph after it was over. Homel Iit was indeed her own dearly loved home to which he bore her. -As the carriage drew up at the door, she sprang quickly to the ground, and, gathering her shawl about her, flew rather than ran along the corridor, until she found herself panting and breathless in her father's study. Slipping the bolt, she threw herself down, by the couch, and, burying her head in her hands, sobbed bitterly. Her father's chair, the books they had read to- gether, his portrait, brought her great loss vividly home to her. His no longerl All was another's, even his child I She could never endure such bondage; even poverty had never been so humiliating. His wife! God in heaven  what mockery was this? There was torture in his presence, in every glance of his eye, every touch of his fingers. Could it be concealed t Long hours she lay, patient now, watching with saddened eyes the old familiar light playing over the walls, watching in a dumb despair. ,ow vividly it all impressed itself upon her I The summer wind played through the open window, the motes glanced in the sun- beams on the polished floor, footsteps echo. ed through the hall, the occasional opening and shutting of a door was borne to her al-   most unconscious ear, the lengthening sha- dows stretched nearer to her couch, the sunlight grew more faint, and the familiar sounds of evening gathered fast around her, and still no footstep sought her solitude, no handessayed the door. She was growing faint "and languid from long and- anxious thought. Even the sense of misery grew less keen. Half rising, she leaned forward and listened. Why had he not sought her? Had he guessed her misery, or had his deli- cacy refrained from intruding upon a nat- ural desire for solitude under her father's roof? A faint blush rose to her cheek.' He had been kind, delicate, and generous; and this thought gave her nerve and courage. She shrank from seeking him. Where be- gin her search? She was ignorant which rooms he had chosen for himself-perhaps he would come. She rose, glanced into the mirror, and, seeing only a pale face with disheveled hair and patient eyes, unlocked the door and seated herself in her father's chair to await him. Her own low stool, which she had been wont to draw to his knee, was-at her feet. A smile rose and died away on- her lip-would she ever nestle in confiding love at her husband's side? It was growing quite late within the room; all was wrapped in summer twilight, and still he had not come. She was growing restless; and with a strange inconsistency began to grow im- patient for the presence of him of whom, but a few hours before, she had thought only with aversion. 'Then came a touch of her old pride; but no time was given for more. What change had come over him, too, in the interval? Doubt, coldness, apathy, all were gone. He had been man enough to conquer. She was his wife, and pride and tenderness should be hers, if not love.  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7518-00000046"/> How the first few hours of that day had been past was not known. Perhaps in one of the struggles from which man emerges stronger and better. He would woo happi- ness and win it; and the delay found Ju- dith less prepared for any resistance. Looking up through the twilight into his face, she saw only kindness, tenderness, and manliness; -and when he put his arms about her, drawing her to him, she leant her head upon his arm; and while the tears forced themselves through her half-closed lids, she voluntarily remained and submit- ted passively to his caresses. All might yet have been well. She was too sensible of kindness to remain cold, and even seeming- ly ungrateful; and Brent, touched by her gentleness, her efforts to please him, her entire submission to his wishes, was be- coming really fond and happy. Only in his absence did she indulge in long and silent abstraction from which nothing had power to arouse her. The effort at- cheerfulness when with him was working its -own cure. It was some- thing to feel that she had his happiness in trust, She was young and ardent. If the present was sunshine, the wretched past was put away from her; and in the future she saw nothing to daunt her. From mo- ments of depression she could turn with the elasticity of youth to pleasures whose source she would not question. Why trouble her- self with queries of what happiness was? Level Standing in her father's home, she looked back to the day when her young girlhood had lapsed by in sweet dreams of happiness and- hope ; to the bitter pain when, lying by her summer fountain, she had clasped to her bosom the fatal letter, and seen' the sky grow dim, and her pulse had throbbed with a strange despair, mute and hopeless. Ay, remembering her pain, it seemed now a childish thing. tater on, when her woman's heart had throbbed with a deep, undying passion for another, she had grown chilled with its Uitter hopelessness, and cried out- in bitter despair; yet now she was the wife of an- other. She could smile at her childish grief, laugh in defiant scorn of her woman's passion I Youth and the power of enjoy- j ent were strong within her and she might   mock at passion and sentiment. From the first clinging caress of her sweet lips her husband had loved her-was happy in her. She knew her power-valued it, perhaps, beyond its worth. In her young, heroic purpose, she vowed him her lifes service. If he were happy, she would be content; repress every murmur of a rebellious heart, stifle every whisper of discontent. Older, graver spirits might smile sadly at her folly; but, as far as within her lay, such was her purpose, and for the present right nobly she fulfilled it. Brent was happier than he had dared to hope. . If he sometimes felt distrust of her cheerful submission, guessing secretly that to a happier woman would have belonged some wifely rebellion; yet, looking upon the bright picture of wifely dignity that graced his home, seeing no shadows on her sunny brow, he gave -himself up to its charm, banishing suspicion and doubt. The inevitable had laid its hand upon her, and she bowed herself gracefully to its thrall. Did any guess her secret? Did she ever feel that her nature was lowering it- self in the effort to meet the wants of his? One or two trials had shown her the hope- lessness of aspiring to more for him. Care and thought and study were relinquished. To .Rachel the change in her child had been surprising, yet on the whole gratifying. "There is happiness in her youth and beau- ty, unless temptation come. God shield her from it!"This had been her thought. She had declined following Judith to her new home, and contented herself with watch- ing over her from a distance. Judith had recoiled, almost unconsciously to herself, from the thought of meeting Elinor. There was a vague feeling that the kind eyes would look through all the disguises which she had drawn around her, and she shrank from even an implied reproach. Perhaps had Elinor looked upon her in this, her best hour of wedded life, she might not have re. proached her, as she did later. For cer. tainly, reader, her motive was the true one; best when it led her to put from her even all incentives to nobler thought and action, when such must- widen the gulf between husband and wife. There was earnest truth in her prayerful, childish petition, "Gol   keep me from temptation!"If her steward- ship was lax, it was surely to be excused, remembering what a perplexing question it must have been to the child-wife. It was something that her first thought through all was to please him, even though the motive.   power which prompted it was nothing bet- ter than gratitude and esteem. Shall any condemn thee, poor Judith   Ah  not then; for there was heroism and daring in the resolve to conquer fate by the better path!  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7518-00000047"/> CHAPTER XXVII. "DEATH lies on her like an untimely frost Upon the sweetest flower of all the field." SHANiSPEARB.   THE pleasant summer had well-nigh pass- ed away, and Judith had heard nothing from Elinor, when Brent came. hurriedly into the breakfast-room, putting into her hand a pa- per containing an account of a disaster on Lake George-the burning of the John Jay. Among the list of passengers were the Greys. One hurried look sufficed to show her that Elinor was safe. Her child and Isabel were lost. Her first feeling was one of heartfelt gratitude for the preservation of her friend; the second brought vividly before her the terrible death of that fair young girl, dead in the bloom of her youth and beauty, and on the eve of her marriage. Like a flash came the thought, "He is free;" and a quick throb of guilty exultation was hers. It was only a thought, and died away on the in- stant. Brent had pushed back his untasted breakfast and walked away to the Window. He was very pale, and seemed deeply dis- tressed. Judith went over to him and leant her cheek on his hand. He put the other, with a caressing motion, on her head, and said, "Poor- HilloryI he is truly to be pitied." She had never thought of him. Ay, what a blow it must be to lose that dearly loved sister Sorrow came to all; why -dwell upon her own in bitterness? She was kindly and tenderly cared for, and would be happy. When Brent left, she went to the study, and, seating herself by the open window, drew her easel toward her, and began idly passing her brush over it. She possessed no little skill, and, since her marriage, had made it a constant re- source against ennui. The morning lagged slowly by, and at noon Judith, after a hasty lunch, set out for a walk. It had been many a day since she had seen Janet: she would go there. The artist was at work. A half-finished picture Stood on the easel, and at this she labored.   A low-lying, level plain stretched out bare and bleak; a new-made grave, at which a female figure knelt with clasped hands and face upturned, on which a pale ray of moon- light lingered; a heavy sky, with jagged clouds flitting over the face of the moon, while one or two stars gleamed faintly out of the darkness. All was sombre and gloomy. Judith stood silently by her side, watching the quick strokes of her brush, studying something of her art. For more than an hour the silence was unbroken, save by the quick strokes of Ja- net's brush. Then she rose, carefully wiped the colors from her brushes, and turned her attention to her guest. Judith knew, with- out speaking, that Janet had heard all. She seemed silent and desponding, a mood so unusual as to be noticeable. Her wrapper was carefully rearranged, her glossy hair smoothed, and, taking some work from a basket at her side, she seated herself at the open window. Judith lay at lazy length in the arm-chair, her hands resting on her knee, like a tired child. "How can you be always occupied," she said, half petulantly, " it is so tiresome?" "It would tire me infinitely more to do nothing," she said, with a smile. Judith turned to thq picture.  "Why did you choose such a gloomy sub- ject? You never did before; and, excuse me, but light and gladness belong more to your pencil." "It is a common subject, death and de- spair," she returned, making no comment on Judith's criticism. "There is enough in real life; why dwell unnecessarily upon it? I detest gloomy things." Janet glanced at the speaker. Truly, bright things seemed most in keeping with such a being. Her fresh, bright-colored face   leant against the crimson lining; her glitter- ing hair fell carelessly about her neck, half uncurled; the cool white of her robe blend- ed with the richer tints of her surroundings, and light' rom  the open widdow lingered caressingly over her.' She could find it in her heart to forgive Brent his faithlessness; and, despite a tinge of egotism, she knew that beauty was not the best gift that be- longed to her. Who could chide the syba- rite, when warmth and luxury seemed to belong so to her 2 "Do you never think of what is disagree- able to you?" she asked, with a smile. "No, not if I can help it; where is the good? We can be happy if we will. There is no truth in despair; the pain of the hour dies with it." A happy freedom from care such a phi- losophy would bring, if we could persuade ourselves to it." "My father thought-so," said   Judith, rousing up with some energy. "He said if the experience of nine persons out of ten was truthfully given, we would find how little hold any feeling had upon us for long. It seems contemptible to say so; but I am afraid it is true. We soon learn to think calmly of our losses;" and she sighed.   I think a loss by death is perhaps the lightest grief. Don't think I speak lightly.  When the inevitable presents itself, there is that within us which bows before it; but, as long as there is hope, we cling madly to it. Unrest and feverish longings will spring up." "I have never been tried by death within a time when I could feel at all," said Janet, in a low voice But Judith' had wandered off on a train s of thought of her own, and remained silent 1 and self-absorbed. After a pause, she turned i her face to the light and whispered:  "Art and eloquence, And all the shows o' the world, are frail and vain To weep a loss- that turns their light to shade It is a 'woe too deep for, tears,' when all Is reft at once; when some surpassing spirit, Whose light adorned the world around it, leaves Thosewho remain behind, nor sobs nor groans, The passionate tumult of a clinging hope;  T But pale despair and pale tranquillity,  Nature's best frame, the web of human things,  Birth and the grave, that are not as they were."  Janet listened half 4reamily to the whis- r   p- pered words, and thought of Isabel, sweet, f gentle, and beloved, snatched remorselessly - from an envied future. Was there a law of I, compensation? d   "Judith," she cried sharply, "is it rebel- i lion to deem her fate a cruel one? Young, ; beautiful, and beloved, hath Heaven a dearer r recompense " Judith turned a startled glance of her - brown eyes upon those of the artist. There ) was that of eager, passionate inquiry that kindled a something responsive in her own. "Janet," she said, drawing nearer to her, "do not ask me. Ah I how often, in bitter- ness, have I asked myself the samel I know no truths but those which my own heart has forced upon me. I tried to believe in all that was grand and true and good. * Where begin the search?   In our own ' hearts?  Mine has failed me miserably. Janet, I have acted a lie; and remorse and shame have come too late. Do not despise me, for, thank God, I am the only sufferer." Yes, as yet she was; but would it be so always? Janet doubted it. She could en- ter little into the wayward impulse that had guided the unhappy girl before her; and she felt some rebuke for her own momen- tary weakness. Of the two, who was most to be pitied? One whom death had early claimed: "Upon whose pallid lips, So sweet even in their silence, on whose eyes That image sleep in death, upon that brow Untouched by sin or paled by shame, No tear might fall, even by pity shed." She could offer no consolation, and re- mained silent. Judith, vexed that she had betrayed any part of her unhappy secret, said: "Death has been kind, Janet. It is hard for young and happy hearts to face falsehood and disappointment.  I, with my eighteen years scarce filled, envy her quiet rest under the rippling waters. For such 1 would say: "et not high verse, mourning the memory Of that which is no more, or painting's woe, Or sculpture, speak in feeble imagery Their ownucold powers.' The shrine consecrated to her will be that of loving hearts. Poor Hillory!

They turned to the discussion of other subjects, and conversed with pleasure upon their art and its votaries; music, and much, at length, upon their favorite authors. "You have read more than I have, but I doubt with as much pleasure." "I am not sure of that," said Judith; "the happiest hours of my life are asso- ciated with my father's study hours. I was early taught a love of books, and read with avidity."  "Exactly; books were your occupation, not your pastime, as they have been mine. You have never known the sweet pleasure of hoarding up to buy some long-coveted treasure; written, with eager land, your name upon the fly-leaf, and said, 'It is mine" Then the stolen moments, some- times standing at the shelves to snatch a stolen glimpse; or, on the occasion of some unwonted indulgence, to lie at lazy length, with nature around you, drinking in through every sense the keen pleasure of communion with the great masters who, even in such imperfect records of noble thought, have furnished food for quiet musing. Like a miser hoarding his gold, I have, with care and toil, surrounded myself with the works of those whom it has been my study to imi- tate. No such pleasure has been yours." "No," said Judith, laughing, "I doubt if it would have been the pleasure to me that it has been to you. I am not one to prize enjoyments dearly bought." "Some of my treasures," continued Ja- net "have been the thoughtful gifts of friends. I need not say they have borrowed pleasantness from such memories." Judith looked at her and thought, "What a pleasure to minister to the happiness of such a life!" Janet turned with a brighter look in her dark eyes: "Do not think, my fair Sybarite, that toil is always enjoyment. I have some- times known, in silly day-dreams, the plea- sure of lolling at lazy length under the spreading shade of green boughs, or by some purling stream, with the pastoral ac- companiment of droning bees or leaping trout, to catch the inspiration of my author."   Judith returned quickly: "Ahl I see it, too, Janet; lying with the ripple of sun- light about you, looking with great, dreamy, dark eyes into, the floating clouds for the inspiration uncaught from the poet." Janet laughed lightly: "Ah I envied poet! Do you know, Judith, I once fancied my- self a poet, because such scenes, such hours, wrought me up to something more than dreamy contentment; because I could listen to the gurgling of water over stony beds, and think of musical harmonies; gaze upon the evening sky, and grow enthusiastic over art; see the dew sparkling upon the grass, and hear the singing of birds, while my own heart throbbed joyously to the measure of nature's own. Foolish fancy I All youths would then be poets Now-" She paused. "What of now?" queried Judith. She came over where Judith lay, and, taking her two hands in hers, said: Later on I kIew that I was one-when I could sit under an August sun in a dusty city and dream of nature, simple, rural, yet vivid in her cool verdure, with sunshine shimmer- ing through leafy trees, with the droning of insects, with the deepening of summer skies Which'I could not see; because I could hear the dripping of water-drops from the eaves, listen to the fierce howling of the tempest, and dream of scenes far out at sea, where, amid angry seas, the vessel toiled-heard the moaning of the tempest-saw the cruel lash- ing of the waves--the eyes of dead men- the lifeless forms tossed by the pitiless sea- all this was mine. This was power. What to me that those whose works I worshiped had stood upon the mountain's brow, and overlooked the ruined cities of the world? walked amid the wrecks of human grandeur, and moralized over human frailty, amid the scenes of her greatness? Once I had wept in passionate grief that the fancies which thronged my brain could find only imper- fect vent; now I rejoiced. The temple of human thought must spring spontaneous, full-clothed-perish all labored efforts at art or literature. With maturer years came the power I have attempted to describe. The sense of light and warmth, the blend- ing of colors, gave me all I wanted; and thought and fancy reared themselves pal-   pably amid the chaos of unmeaning realities. Such power as might annihijate the con- sciousness of the present and bear one with it from tempest to sunshine, from gloom to rapture, I coveted. If I hlave failed to ob- tain it, all the libor of a life has been vain. I have been an imitator of those whose genius I have admired, yet no servile one. With their volumes on my knee, with the harmony of their measure in my ear, with the brightness of glorious poet-fancy, I have closed my eyes and taken in all with a dreamy, half unconsciousness, which, per- haps, in after hours of thought and study, have come back to me bearing the coloring and fancy of my own mind. Such has been my mode of reading-naturally, it has been slow." In this rapid outpouring of the artist's literary toils. and aspirations, Judith mar- veled to see much to which her own heart's truthful exposition could attest. She made no reply, and after along and c thoughtful silence rose to take her leave. e In the success, as yet perhaps only partial,  of the artist, she saw some hope for her own u efforts. Truly, such a life as had been laid i bare was worth the purchase of some indo- lent ease. A half envy of the fire that had leapt to the eye and cheek of Janet mingled with her feelings.   Where, in the idle, lounging life of fash- ionable indolence could she find the pleasure that Janet derived from the success of her own praiseworthy ambition- an ambition seemingly pure and unalloyed? No desire for approbation, no feverish longing for praise, no undue regard for the encouragement of others mingled with her pleasure. Alone, and one might say friend- less, life was still worth every thing to her. The contrast to her own-nature pained and shamed her. She had found mankind un- true, yet courted their approbation; pre- tended to despise them, yet could not stand alone. Every effort toward a higher destiny must meet with encouragement and success. Janet knew too little of them to value them unduly; knew herself too well to despise them in their weakness and self-indulgence. Judith, young, gifted, beautiful, and wealthy, had found it in her heart to envy the poor artist the happiness of which none could rob her. Discouragement met her on every side, yet she remained undaunted, undismayed. Truly, as Judith once re- marked, hers was a perfect destiny; hers seemed the spirit "To suffer woes which hope thinks infinite; To forgive wrongs darker than death or night; To defy power Which seems omnipotent; To love and bear, to hope till hope creates From its own wreck the thing it contemplates."  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7518-00000049"/> CHAPTER XXVII.. "TaOUGH the rock of my last hope is shivered, And its fragments are sunk in the wave.; Though I feel that my soul is delivered To pain, it shall not be its slave." BYRaoN.   Ifr the luxurious comfort of his bachelor lodgings, surrounded by his gay and careless companions, Stanley had heard, with a touch of rermorse and bitterness, of Isabel's death, The slender, white fingers closed with dan- gerous firmness over the frail glass he held; the curved- lips wreathed in smiling answer to the sallies of his friends; yet there was sadness enough in even his cold heart, think- ing of the fair, childish form lying fathoms deep under the, great lakes.  Hour after hour passed of enduring torture whhile he played the host; listening absently to the clinking of- glasses, the rattle of knives and. forks, glancing half disdainfully at the rap- turous content of the gourmet on his left; hearing, with a smiling, apathetic scorn, the vapid jests of the wit on his right. But his martyrdom finds an end at last; and when the last bumper has been drained to youth and beauty, the last footstep of departing guests echoes faintly through the rooms; when the stars are paling above, and the solitary rattle of cab-wheels breaks the still- ness below, Stanley turns impatiently. from the stifling sweets of dying exotics, the un- tasted fragments of his feast, the fumes of wine and smoke, and sinks wearily back to think. With his dark face bent back against the cushioned chair, a ray from the gas-lights above falling on it, something pale and seri; ous, yet losing nothing thereby, we can see that the smile should have died awayfrom those stern lips hours before. Cold and worldly, he thinks, with a sadness not all selfish, of the fate of the child who was to have been his wife. Perhaps nothing more than a tool of his ambition in the beginning; but he can think now very tenderly of the sweet purity of that childish face stilled in death. Dreams of worldly greatness, selfish   longings, all give place now in, the sanctity of that first hour of grief for her he has lost. Mingling with this later on is some bitter- ness for disappointed hopes. Thelfabric, which with unscrupulous hand he had reared, regardless of pain and sorrow to others, had crumbled at a touch, and he felt abashed at his failure. Not callous enough to accept his failure as a more practiced di- plomat might, he felt that, somehow, the failure lay more in himself than in fate. Where lay the error?   With habitual care he had lent, himself to schemes which seemedto promise success; had adopted no half-way measures-all had been sacrificed to gain this end. Honor, love, fidelityl what had they become tohim   more than names? He had cheated himself into some- thing like peace, even after their loss. The recollection of Janet Was resolutely buried until it had become scarcely more than a memory. Of Judith he scarcely thought at all. In some measure he had learned a pride in Isabel, a fondness for something which, pleasant in itself, borrowed pleasant- ness from the idea of possession. His books, his paintings, the nicknackeries which he had collected to amuse his idle hours, or to indulge a taste critical and ascetic in the ex- treme, gave him equal pleasure, or had, six hours before; yet, looking upon them now, he felt Some scorn for himself that in such thipgs:he could ever have felt pleasure. He feilt a desire to find fault with himself, a savage pleasure in measuring the littleness of the past few months with the bygone years of his manhood, before he had for- sworn his honesty. He had passed, serenely conscious of his power over them, among his fellow-men, taking his place in their legisla- tions, raising his voice among them in passion-   ate oratory; pleading wIth earnest tones, with harmonious gesture, with' impassioned fervor for truth, for honor, for justice; and he had won-all stakes were swept before him. He hated and scorned himself, knowing all The successful barrister, the gifted public speak- er, wiping the: moisture from his pale brow, avoiding the comments and congratulations of his auditors, smiles scornfully upon them. He has played his part well. Where look for truth? From the voice, the eye, the tone; eyes that light the fires of indignant, out- raged virtue in our own; tones that melt the heart in:tender pity; a voice from out whose ringginfg tones speak the accents of tfuth. Easy to deceive where heart and mind, eye andqlip, have been tutored from the cradle; perhaps turning from such scenes to act anew the cheat of parlor oratory, with woman for his auditor; perhaps, had some hon- est eye, some keen-sighted woman friend, laid a hand on his, and looked the reproach of truth-telling eyes into his, he had blushed tnd turned iside for her sake. Such thoughts wreathed themselves into his brain, and har- dened the contemptuous scorn that flashed from his keen eye. len had been his tools, his puppets-*-women his dupes; all but one, and here he relaxed his bold brow-and sighed. . After long months he could think of her with'even a deeper regret than that felt for his lost bride. He was free! yet the exul- tant smile that wreathed his lip died away on the instant Yes, he was free! to what?. He had bound himself in' a thraldom- worse - than death; the bondage of, cruel treachery and deceit. A wide gulf severed him from his dark-browed mistress; the queen'who had once ruled the realm of witching fancy. A few narrow streets lay between his lodg- ings arid hers; yet no mad fancy possessed him to: overleap- the barrier which his own trecheiry had reared'. They had parted months ago- under her humble roof, and he remembered hosw vividly, looking -back into the' darkening room, and seeing her standing in the red firelight, with the flush of injured feeling on her swarthy cheek, the look of mute' inquiry in her dark eyes, with the un- usual glow'df ter amber robe, the gleam of jewels, and the dark folds of the ermine tloak falling about her. In any thought   'which'bririgs the oim dof one we love before us, there, is - &amp;something -which - seems -to stand prominiently :before us, and all else sinksinto comparative insigificance. There was that in his vision of Janet which accord- ed with the mood into which he had wrought himself; and alas!- it was neither virtue nor truth, -neither mind nor-heart that held its tmagle sway; ,His firm lip writhes at the remembrance of his sacrifice; his mind mas filled :with tenderness and passionate regret for his forsaken mistrtes.

If any half- formed design of aneew and better existence dawned upon him, it was speedily banished.

How strive for good 'with. out herI Even then the struggle had often been n-more than 'his manhood could wrestle in.. "And so, hesitating :and doubting, with  only a half-formed. purpose 'to conquer him- self, Stanley's fate guided him again into' the circles of fashionable life, to meet, with, some surprise, ;Judith Grant. 'The, face he had left pallid with despair, cheeks wet with passionate tears, eyed rigid -in 'hopelessness, was brilliant now with the coloriiig of youth and hopje, and, could he believe it, happiness. Her eyes followed Brept's movements with an anxious eagerness, and, sometimes win- ning a smile from him, relaxed into a ripple of almost childish pleasure. -Powers curled his fne lip in a contemptuous scorn; He had been only the destined dupe of a practiced. coquette. Upon Brent he looked with re- inewed dislike. The quiet, absent manner had deepened into 'one of listlessness and languor, which 'seemed to betoken little hap- piness, if it were to be measured by any Standard of his own. His wife seemed to 'absorb little of his attention, and Stanley ooin learned to' look with a half pity at her efforts to seem happy and ontented. Not many hours had passed' before he could scan her face iith his keen eye, and note the quick transitions of weariness and mortified vanity that passed over it Her husbands indifference pained her. She sought his no- tice often vainly, and would turn her eyes absently from him, while the color paled on her cheek. Powers looked upon him   in positive anger.' She was one whose beauty an em- peror might, have envied; yet he had seen hinm repeatedly leave the. house. without a glance toward the expectant young wife who awaited his caress. His interest in her   deepened into a pity dangerous to both, if expressed; and, with' a wavering sense of honor,-he refrained from a word which be- tokened sympathy; but there is a sympathy -of eye which needs no word to express, and more than once Judith had seen in his that before which her proud spirit quailed. -Con- tinued intercourse gradually melted his scruples, and Brent's indifference tempted 'his interference. "Dullard 1" he muttered, "if he has no eyes for such meek devotion from that proud woman, it is friendly to open them." To do Brent justice, he never saw or felt any thing of the play that was enacting daily I before his eyes. As a single man, he had been social, and never realized that his wife had greater claims upon him than his bache. or companions. The caresses for which she vainly looked he never thought of bestowing. The first caress of the sorrowing girl, in her lonely, orphaned home, had rather awakened surprise than tenderness. He had married through pity, rather than love; had sur- rounded his wife with luxuries and comforts, assumed his'place in society with dignity and decorum, and certainly would have been astounded at any charge of coldness or ne- glect With Judith, pride sealed her lips; no murmur of complaint escaped her. She felt 'more and more, daily, that there was neither sympathy nor communion between them, and learned, half despairingly, that all the future lay before her without one ray of hope or brightness. Often, after he had left her, she would clasp her small hands firmly together' over her bosom to still its rebellious throbbings; but his return ever found her calm and gentle and affectionate. She could be that, for he was never harsh or unkind, and, poor child, her highest knowledge of wifely duty was submission; and she had been too much accustomed to loving words and gestures not to bestow them freely. There was neither guile nor hypocrisy in her nature ;' yet, had he known the wild rebellion in that heart, while her lips touched his or her eyes smiled into his own, he would have believed only in her vileness. As yet, no warning of the truth had come to him. He left her to the com- panionship of bools. Poor companions, when the heart cries wildly for sympathy.   He never dreamed that his presence at home would have given her happineiss, for he had always contrasted himself humbly with his gifted young wife. To her frequent inquiry, "You will return early?" he had answered   at random, believing it only a matter of form, and unheeding the disappointment in her face. And so 'both drifted ignorantly on to wrong and sorrow, unheeding where the error lay.  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7518-00000051"/> CfTAPTER ' XXX. "THSER are crimes, Made venial by the occasion, and temptations Which nature can not master or forbear.," BYRON.   THE sweet October days were gathering over Pine Ridge, and found the young cou- ple, with a bevy of friends, whiling away the hours in the pleasant pastimes of coun- try life. Brent, with several companions,! stood on the lawn, dressed in their hunting costumes, while a number of fine hounds barked and jumped about them, eagerly awaiting the signal to dash away into the forest. Nevil, in his foraging cap and dress, -his rifle'flung across his shoulder, his bugle at his side, was talking with some animation to his companions, and Judith looked upon *him with some pride. His short, sunny curls escaping from under his cap, his broad, athletic form, perfect in its manhood, was a pleasing picture to her artistic eye. Powers stood a few paces apart, leaning on his gun and moodily watching the group. Judith advanced, and timidly ventured somer re- -mark, to 'which Brent made no :replytinot even ceasing his conversation to listen. BShe waited, hesitated a moment, and, receiving no reply, remained standing, pained and dis- -pleased at his rebuff. In another moment 'Brent ceased, and, without turning toward 'her or seeming to see her, raised his bugle, -wound it, and the answering hounds leap- -ing forward in mad ecstasy, the group were soon out of sight. For some moments Ju- dith looked after their retreating figures, *then turned, and went slowly up the path that led to the house. The October sunlight streamed richly over :the hills, and the shadows crept waveringly * over the lawn. The portico was supported by :marble pillars; and, throwing herself down, she leant against one of them, gazing out ,on the broad expanse of sunlight and sha- dow, ,while her face darkened with an ex- tpression of almost hopeless weariness. - She i had never meant that others should see her disappointment, had perhaps never admitted   its full extent even to herself; yet now, seated on that low door-step, with the au- tumn sunlight lying about her, she was thinking bitterly of that first meeting on the bridge under the pines, in the red light of a winter's evening. "He was not thinking of me then; he never cared for me afterward I I forced myself and my sorrows upon him, and he pitied and married me, half mad him- self with misery. AhI let me die, let me die 1" She lay at length on the marble pavement, her bright eyes open and tearless. "My fa- ther, my father," she moaned, "why did you leave me? I was so lonely and uncared for, I could not bear it!"All the past came before her: the kindly " touch of a vanished hand," the accents of a loved voice that had once been hers., "Will it always be so? Will hie never care for me? Let me die, ah! !teme die!" o Form some moments Stanley 'had leant with folded arms against a marble column, looking down upon her, half in pity, half in sadness; Now he spoke, and his voice startled the silence: "Poor child!" Springing from her recumbent posture, and raising her flashing eyes to his, while. the red blood mounted to her face, she cried angrily: "How dare you, how'dare any one pity me? You least of all?" "And why not I?" he asked. She had betrayed herself, and, covering her face with her hands, burst into a passion- ate fit of weeping. He drew near and seated himself by her side. '"You are lonely and desolate; you need companionship; you need, more than- all, a friend : let me be that friend. There is no tone of your voice, there is no shade on your face that my eyes have not seen. There has been a strong sympathy between us. That which you seek from another can -,   never be yours. Ah I Judith, I might say, ' Why did you risk your happiness on such a chance?',:but I will not; reproaches are useless now,.or worse than useless. The sympathy offa friend is not to be despised; shall it?" Reader, I will not say that she was utter- ly deceived by such reasoning; but her dis. appointment in her husband was very great If she had not looked for congeniality of mind and taste, she had expected affection and tenderness I This she had sought, and it had been denied. her. She was to him "somethingl better than his dog, a little dearer than his horse." It was hard for a sensitive, proud nature to bear. Powers had surprised her in an unguarded hour of weakness. His manner was kind and re- spectful in the extreme. iHe-had spoken the truth-she needed companionship sorely I that companionship of mind and spirit which she found in him, The boon was offered, :could she reject it? One timid glance, a quiver of the full, red lip, and he knew that the first step was won, "Once, Judith, I might have, hoped for more than your half-implied promise would give; but the' sad events which darkened your life marred, my rash hopes, and cast me, likeyoursf, into a current of circum- stances which we were powerless t control; and looking upon you, I can rejoice in my escape. To me, at least, has been spared the bitter thraldom of an unloved union. I have no ties to draw me from an interest in your happiness, which time will provue to be sincere and worthy of you." How sweet such, an avowal might have been once, but she knew that now she must not listen to it.- Her face expressed her disapproval, and Powers, With ready tact, changed the conversation into a quieter chan- nel, She learned calmness and strength, and the hours passed. rapidly away in talk of poets, artists, and aputhors: how heart and mind had expanded under the associ- ations of beauty, the loftier influences of nature and art; how perceptions of their grand truths had dawned upon the canvas, and, through the powerful limnijg of an au- thor's pen, we had read, the heart's mysteries, the secret of lives, f which, from all else, we had remained in ignorance.   "If I am not mistaken'; he said, ",youe can write, and write well. Therem is harmn o ny in your naturewith all, creations of beau- ty.

It is the sadness, the delicious melancholy, which characterizes the nature of a poet, and  is inseparable from it. That which we,4de.. ride as the fripperies and affectations of,'. genius are only its natural attendants.- It is the want of sympathy with his fellow-mena which makes him turn to things inanimate or to nature for solace. These he rhapso-, dizes or invocates for solace and sympathy.: I do not say that to be sad or..sorrowful in-.. dicates a poetic temperament; yet I do 'say. that, be a poet, and you become both sad and , melancholy.

I doubt the wisdom of my entering upon any occupation which would deepen sentiment and-sensibility. My life is too essentially practical in its details for me to enter. upon such a field. I have sometimes doubted the wisdoni of my cultivating any higher ambi- tion than my surroundings demand. I only wish to do my duty." "Your duty 1 Does that comprise your 'sinking to his level day by day,' or -raising him to yours " .  "It is not in my' power to raise him, therefore the duty'becomes narrowed to the siiple'question of lowering myself that I may not despise him."  Her tone was one of extreme bitterness, andlhe said: "I am no canter, and detest catt of anr kind, but I do recognize a some- thing in every worthy nature which would forbid its lowering its standard willfully.

Indeed, I think it best she should not; for, pardon me; Ju- dith, but few wouldexcuse your hasty mar- riage, of impute other than unworthy mo-  tives to you."  fe was not disposed to let her forget that  he held her at a just estimate. She was  frightened at the hold he had won- over her in so' short; a time, angry with herself that  she had been led into personal disparage- { mentof'her husband, and anxious to resume i generalities.           .    You. spoke of my writing. Even putting aside its feasibility as a question of duty, I doubt you overrate tny power. Il know that when I feel most deeply I express my- self worst. I can express a'sentiment with more force on canvas than on paper." "' Therefore you argue yourself more'artist than poet, yet it is not so. When you are sketching, the effort is slow, and gives time for your thought to take form and expres- sion and adapt itself to the purposes of a more finished. afterthought. The process of writing is more rapid, and allows too much license to copiousness of expression. When you write more, you will learn to prune as you proceed, or to let the impression remain long enough in your mind to be absorbed and improved by'cooler reflection. Scenes through which we have passed, or sensations which we have experienced, can be more faithfully described after a lapse of time; and, while the' representation is equally vivid, it is deprived of the fictitious aid of excitement and high coloring, and therefore better adapt- ed to the mindd of others." I have known a very powerful writer, one who could warm the heart and quicken the pulse, yet who had never entered upon the scenes she portrayed, had never strayed beyond her own door, andfwho Seemiingly had never known the quickening pulse of passion, never felt the throb of disappoiht- ment or despair; yet she has' pictured all this. Vivid and lifelike, they have found their way to, hearts to which passion and'de- spair had been bitter realities. They have glowed from her canvas as a living truth; yet she was a poor artist. Her tones are low, modulated, and even, yet they have stirred ,the heart and warmed the spirit. Youfeel the power;,of which there is no out-. ward evidence, and you know that that'sim- ple woman would dare and do more than many an actor in the conflict of life." He had sat perfectly unmoved while she described the one whom he knew so well, and said, quite calmly': "You mean Janet Somers; yet how many would you judge by her t Not frail creatures like you and me." He had learned to link their names together quite naturally; he had thrown down the gaintlet and defied her to take it up. There was no time for raore; forethe musical tones of the bugle pealed over'the hills, and when   the autumn sunlight died on the tree-tops, the huntsmen wound over the summit of the hills and the hounds came running swiftly toward them-. Judith gathered her skirt in her hand, and for one instant Powers saw her looking out over the still landscape at the moving figures in the distance; saw her look half-shyly, half-appealingly at him, and disappear under the lighted doorway. He knew what that look meant; guilt is timid, and she feared their comments on his' -idleness. He feared nothing. What had he   to Iose or gain? Yet he was not satisfied with his evenihg's work. He had gone fur- ther than he meant; only pity for. her had staid his footsteps, and the sympathy had proved stronger than he meant it should. He had violated the hospitality of a man he hated. "I will go to-morrow," he muttered; yet when the morrow came, his resolution failed before the mute pleading of her eyes, and 'he lingered until the autumn was fast waning into winter before he returned to his labors-in the city. .   &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7518-00000053"/> CHAPTER XXX A' "IAsANT at noon, beside the vocal brook, -  To lay one down and watch the floating clouds, Andbalape to fancy's -wld imagitiings  Their ever-varying forms."   SourTse .   ON the night which followed her conver- sation with Powers, Judith-was anxious and Wakeful. Reviewing all that had passed, she could charge herself with no positive disloyalty, yet she had an unpleasant con- sciousness that she had betrayed a wife's sacred trust. She felt that much of her trouble had grown out of Stanley's reappear- ance among them. A feeling of intolerance toward Brent grew stronger as he was brought into contrast with Powers. If his manner was respectful, his words void of any tone which could offend, there was a freedom, a license of look, which warned her against his approaches. Early the next morning Brent left for the village, which lay some twenty AileU dis- tant, and whither he had been summoned as a juror. Judith had determined that sifi would avoid Powers, and, true to herdeter- mination, an early hour found her at her canvas. She had drawn her easel forward to the deep window which overlooked the lawn, and from whence she could command a wide survey of the surrounding country. She sketched with great industry, for her thoughts were very'busy, though not with her canvas. Out under the trees, on a gar- den bench, she could descry the indolent form of Powers, his head resting on an arm, a book held listlessly in his hand, while the smoke of a fragrant Havana, held lightly be- tween his lips, curled lazily upward, wreath- ing fairy rings in the hazy atmosphere. A large brown pointer lay stretched on the grass at his feet, his fore-paws extended, his head resting upon them, and his soft, watch- ful eyes fastened upon his master's face. She knew that Powers's eye sometimes wan- dered to the window where she sat, and had   a dim perception that he expected her to join him. The temptation was strong! The air was fresh, and pleasant, and hazy with the languid clouds that floated overhead, and she knew how much pleasanter it was out under that tree with Rover and Powers, and nature and books and pleasant chat, than sitting mewed up in a room, mixing sienna and Prussian blue, rubbing out chalk lines, and vexing herself with a vain effort to picture waterfalls and gleaming fields. A long morning wore away, and at lunch Powers lounged in with Rover at his heels. "You have been commendably industri- ous this mOrning, not to be tempted by na- ture or her humble votaries," he said sarcas- tically. The hand she laid on Rover's silky ears frembled a little as she said: "I have been -tryiig to'work out the problem we discussed last evening-poet or artist. Look at my canvas and decide for me." "I am not a fair judge in any production of yours: you have one vocation- to charm." Commonplace flattery enough, but which comes new from the lips of the man we love. He stood at her easel, apparently scanning her work with the minute eye of a critic. It was the old bridge, picturesque in its rude architecture, spanning the spiral stream that gurgled beneath. It was well sketch- ed, and the delicate, spiral stems of the qui- vering lilies displayed no little skill in the finish of a good artist, "Your sketch seems, to my fancy, admi- rable, and, if carefully completed, will do you credit. Will you let me suggest a degree more of light? Your forest for background, I the dusk of the river, the sombre hue of age   for your rustic bridge-- you will see it requires some lightening. Picture some evening in your recollection look at that warm dash of sunlight over the lawn, and transfer it creeping into the folded petals of your lilies; sketch a hbuman figure, or cat- tle drinking at the ford lower down, and, in design, at least, none will dispute your claim to artistic skill and beauty. If you are still disposed for industry, resume your brush, and we can spend several hours pleasantly." She certainly had not intended such a wind-up to her morning, but there was noth- ing in his offer Which she could reject with- out rudeness, and she resumed her-brush silently. He drew a low camp-stool to her sideand, gravely selecting her colors, ground and mixed them, a ththe work proceeded in silence and without interruption beyond an occasional comment from Powers on the dis- posal of light or shade, the hue of cloud or leaflet on the water's edge. It grew with rapidity, and Judith, having become now quite absorbed in her occupation, drew off sometimes to a distance to study effects, then drew near, and, now standing, now sitting, fell into somethiig like animated chat. "Ah! if I could finish it at once.' This is my favorite spot among these1 beautiful hills. I love Pine Ridge. My father's first thought in its selection was to give me plea- sure; loving it, you see, I am painting it. I tried vainly all the morning to imagine some- thing grand and terribly picturesque, and failed. I am terribly deficient in-what do artists term it?-inventive faculty. At local imagery I wilt^do." And she clapped her hands and laughed merrily. What a very child she was sometimes, and again serious, with all the dignity, the passion, and fervor of m6inanhoodl Powers smiled, took the brush from her hand, and said, while he bent his brows in mock sternness: "If I were a proper tutor, and 'had the requisite love for high art, I would draw my brush, wet with asphaltum, over your sketch. The sententious critic gives'as a safe rule that we must destroy that which, of our own productions, we hold in highest estimation. However, I will only add something to your sketch."     ; Mrith a bold and rapid pencil he sketched for some thirty minutes, and bade her look.   It was her own likeness, minute yet perfect, leaning or half reclining against an abutment of the bridge; a: loose summer robo flowing around, her; one hand holding a sketch-book, while the other lay caressingly on Rover's head. The -dog seemed looking meditatively at the water, and there was an attitude of quiet repose that was well in keeping with the details of the picture. "You see how well I have preserved the harmony of your picture. The drooping of the lily-leaves harmonizes with the fold on fold of your spotless drapery; the seri- ous expression on Rover's countenance meets the rapt reverie into which your own eyes have fallen under their long lashes; the wa- ter lapses with a gentle motion over the stones; the cattle at the ford are motionless  in the act of drinking; the very breath that sways the reeds and lilies seems to die in touching them. No breezy odors are wafted from the solemn, uplifted crowns of the dim - forest in the distance; the sun creeps stealth- ily over all, as if loth to disturb a serenity so beautiful. It-is a perfect embodiment of the poetical and artistic in still life." Judith had listened, well pleased at his eulogy bn their joint production. "You shall write that out as a criticism on my picture before it adorns the walls of some discriminating lover of fine art," she said gayly. "Did you ever notice," he said, "how in looking at a painting some one object seems to arrest the eye, and stand, as it were, pro- minently before us in our afterthoughts of it? - I remember once seeing a painting, of which I think the title was 'Evening in a Forest.' It :represented a wild and gloomy forest: a boulder of granite rearing itself, dark and dim, against the sombre back- ground; and in the foreground was a young girl pausing, with a lapful of berries and forest blossoms, and- glancing forward as if doubtful of her path. There was one single object, minute and in itself perhaps not ob- servable, which riveted my attention, and fixed every detail of the picture in my mind. On the girl's bosom lay a small bunch of the Indian balsam, with its scarlet, velvety petals. Bright as a gem of Araby, it shone amid 4al the sombre hue ofthe scenery, which even the fresh, timid face of the girl  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7518-00000054"/> had failed to enliven, and my eye was fasci. nated by it. It was the centre from which my mind wandered to the details of the pic- ture."' He had been wiping his brushes, and now cried, "Come, we have had enough of work-let's have a-stroll; we can be back by dark." The morning had been too-plea- sant for her to refuse a continuance; and her spirits rose at the thought, "We have spent four hours of the purest pleasure which one can derive from intercourse with a gifted mindd."- Her straw hat was speedily procured, and, followed by Rover, they set forth. The evening was mild, with just enough of sun- shine to enhance -the beauty of the land- scape. The crimson leaves were drifting at intervals from the trees, with a gentle rust- ling, and piling themselves in little heaps of russet brown. The hedges were gay with the scentless bloom of autumnal blossoms. The forest paths-wound through clustering tendrils of jasmine vines; and the occasion- al halloo of the laborers in the fields was borne on the evening air. They reached the brink of the river, which here broadened into some expanse of water, clear and lucid, with the pebbles at its bottom.; gliding be- tween green banks, where in the spring the white blossoms of the dogwood scented the breeze, and overarching forest-trees formed a cool retreat. Powers laughingly pointed out a most inviting seat for Judith, where, spread- ing her drapery, she folded her hands in quiet enjoyment on her bosom, and motion- ed to the sward at her feet. He needed no second bidding, but stretched himself at length in his favorite attitude, with one arm supporting his head and his eyes bent on her. Rover came and stood at her side, rub- bing his cold nose on her hand, and seeking 'hls own share of attention. "Now," said Powers, "we have all the accessories-exerciseyourimagination. Look at that limpid stream, with the jutting sha- dows from overhanging banks, the depth of sunshine in its bosom. It, needs but the leaping trout, the angler's rod, to make me feel; myself an Izaak Walton, and gravely set to philosophizing on the science of his 'gentle craft.' " "Go on," she said, smiling as he paused.   "Now, transport my fancy to the 'river winding down' amid the harvest fields of barley and rye; add the eye of the poet, and picture' the ' four gray walls, and four gray towers,' and -" "And surely you would not liken me to the unfortunate Lady of Chalott," she inter- rupted. "Nay, your fancies might be happier;with this expanse of heavenly blue overhead, this delicious sunshine around us, and the I lull- ing cadence of running water at our feet. You could picture --"  "Something brighter, happier far. If the poet's heart throbs like mine in scenes like this, what wonder that his pen is dipped in wells of inspiration? Oh I if I could'write I If the power I .ovet was mine, I would not waste existence as an idle dreamer. The sweetest rapture of reverie could not woo my spirit to peace. I long for the larger ex- 'citements of life--the noble struggles that nerve heart and brain I Were I a man and an author, my inspiration should be drawn not through dreamy speculations on the re- lies of an almost forgotten past, sanctified, it is true, with the halo of classic associa- tion, but calm in their grandeur and desola- tion. Neither would I seek it in dreamy, indolent longings for the beautiful, amid the gardens of enchanted Italy. Were I an au- thor, my inspiration should be drawn from the fierce excitements of real life, where one learns more in twelve hours of danger and disaster than in years of idle lounging in the ' Halls of the Montezumas.' The deserts of Arabia; the swift flight of my courser;, the wild jungles of Africa; the perilous gorges of the mountain's path; the leap for life in chamois hunt; the wrestle of nerve and sinew, with the panting breath of the wild beast brushing your cheek; the tempestu- ous heaving of your bark on a stormy sea; the gist of every conflict where the power, the will, the daring of man may conquer and achieve-these would be the sources of my inspiration." She had half risen in her excitement, and Powers had almost forgotten to listen in his earnest attention to her face. "You must have felt something of this: you are a man I  With a long arrear of   years, through which you must look back to , some scenes of, triumph which nerved your spirit to dare and do." The rhapsodies of youth, to which, per- haps, he had'listened hundreds of times be- fore ;. yet it came with a freshness from her lips. It was no sham. The stern spirit whose power she coveted -and invoked had leapt to her eye, and lent its aspect to her face. He knew something of its source, but, unwilling to foster such a mood, said laugh- ingly: "Come, my gentle shepherdess of a few moments ago, you have transformed yourself to a very. Pythoness; becoming, indeed, but scarcely fitting the sweet scene- which we came to enjoy." She felt in no mood to return his banter, and, rising, wandered off to the river, her "wdine-dark drapery, fbld on:fold, imprison- ed by an ivory hand," her lithe form clearly defined against the evening sky. Every mo- tion, every line of her figure, betokened a repose in unison wth every artistic percep- tion of grace and beauty. Powers still lay looking at her, until his thoughts blent sleep- ily with images of Undines .and:mermaids, leaving theriver's brink to charm his lulling fancy. Fading, dim and indistinct, with the deepening shadows,. was that slender, grace- ful form,- the delicate profile turned from him, the dark, wistful eyes, serious with un- defined, poetic longings, and Rover, grim and stately, standing at her side... The river, theI vision faded from him with the present, and the reality of things was forgotten. The faintest chirp of insects lulled his senses, un- til, far away, the sound of a horse's hoof strikes the bridge, and Judith turns with a start, and lays a hasty hand on his arm. "Come," she says, "my golden calendar is closed; we must return."   "Ay, here another day," he answers lazi- ' ly. "What a short day it has been!" She walks at his side, silent, but not un- *thinking. Hand and heart were full.   She had one thought still in her mind, and it stole to her lips in a murmur so low that he beht with a smile to catch it: "Man one harmonious soul of many a soul, Whose-nature is Its own divine control When all things flow to all, as rivers to the sea. Al things confess his Strength. Through the cold Mass of marble, and of color, his dreams pass. Langruage is a perpetual Orphic song Which rules with Daedal harmony a throng Of thoughts and forms which else senseless and shapeless were." She saw by the flash, the almost moisture in his eye, that he understood her, and he made no replyj though he slightly pressed the light fingers that rested on his arm. She left him to his musings, ahd returned to her own thoughts. In all ways the day had been a golden one. No unguarded allusion had brought a blush to her cheek, no remembrance of Ne- vil had marred her enjoyment. It had been pure and unalloyed pleasure; and, thinking of it, she could even bear the thought of fac- ing him and her guests. Fortunately for her temper, she saw little of them during the day. One a sportsman, the other an ama- teur farmer, their hours were given to their favorite pursuits, and the evenings were spent at cards. Once seated at the tables, Judith could spend her evening at her pi. ano, secure from interruption. She sang sweetly, if without much skill; and I will not say that her voice did not often borrow softness in its tremor from a sense of the still, solitary figure that rested behind the' curtained window.  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7518-00000055"/> CHAPTER XXXI. "Wao despises fame Will soon renounce the virtues that deserve It." MALLET.   THE morning post had arrived, and the breakfast group leisurely sorted and pe- rused their letters, between intervals of cof- fee and rolls. 'Brent applied himself to the weekly paper, the sportsman and farmer held-mutual discourse on^the feasibility of a ,hunt, or a farm visit for the morning, and Powers seemed deeply absorbed in the con- tents of his letters. As he finally rose, and pushed back his chair, Judith said: "Elinor will be with u1t to-day, perhaps totdinner i"' A gleam of pleasure flashed athwart Brent's face. The idea of meeting the Greys was al- w  s suggestive bf pleasure. "I' have just arrived at the same intelli- gence, through a letter from my friefid"Grey," sadtPowers. Nevil- stretched out his hand for tie letter, which Powers extended, re- marking: "It is filled with the oine theme which seems to absorb all politicians. The events now ripening are but the foreshadow- ings of that' which seems inevitable-war I And Grey dweits upon it with the prdpheti6 spirit of disaster, which I am unwilling to accept. If it comes, we are certainly in some measure prepared forit. I, at least, shall not shrink from it." He glanced carelessly at Judith. There had been a shade of anxious thought on her face which, as he closed, passed away, and her lips broke into a 'smile. "War!" she exclaimed. "I can scarcely realize'that we are on the eve of stirring events. The day of martial glory seemed to have faded from our sunny shores. I know nothing of war beyond its pomps, the long vistas which its stirring paths open to fame, and the renown which all men should covet. It seems in- credible that our streets may soon ech 'to the tread of marching feet; that the old flag which has been our symbol should be stript from its staff, to plant a Southern banner of defiance! Our people seem so essentially peace-loving. Yet there is rapture in the   thought that the days of chivalry are upon us ., Powers smiled, and said: "Grave spirits see more in this dawning era than the gauds, the eempty pomp of war, or even, the nobler struggle for 'a soldier's name or a soldie's grave.' It is the stern conflict of duty; the warring of a patriot's soul which shall nerve his arm to strike, even at the threshold of his own door." "You talk' like a .woman, Judith," said Brent gravely; but certainly it seems to me no theme for foolish rhapsody, It will be nod desire for "fame which would lead me to take up arms against the Government which has so long been our protection." Judith had colored deeply, yet her eyes flashed a little as she said somewhat scorn- fully: '"Renown, even war for the lesser cause would be something. I could pardon the love of self which prompts a soldier's vanity; but to be nothing would require more nerve." Brent was not unmindful of the thrust, though he made no reply, and silently re- sumed his perusal of Grey's letter. "For my part," said Stanley, "'I must confess to the eagerness with which I wel- come even the scent of blood, where it pro- mises some of the larger excitements for which bold spirits yearn. I could never censure Satan, seeing him as Milton paints him;,a spirit filled with the power, the attri- butes, the majesty of God; filled, too, with the panting ambition which led him on to stir up revolt in heaven sooner than main- tain the staid monotony which must render even paradise wearisome." / "Then you justify the spirit of evil which has-led toi/this war, while you yet declare your readiness t9 fight away the evils to which it has :ed,' said;ent quietly. "Here seems an inconsisteop. ,and little, too, of that patriotic fifroei which alone makes the terrors of war suibfl." i,.*' . ' i   Powers turned toward him testily, some- what surprised' at 'the energy and thought which had dictated his words. "If I win the fame I seek, few there are who will inquire the motive which urged me to the attempt. -In the halo, the flush of success, we look only to the end achieved; and, my friend, say I enlist in this war through a desire, laudable surely, for fame; you reluctantly ass ime your r6le from love of wife and home. Say fortune favors both, think you your satisfaction will exceed my own? Each wins the stake he played for; and my gratified ambition yields me as sweet a pleasure as you derive from self-conscious approbation." He rose, and sauntered slowly away to the window. Brent sat with his eyes still fixed on vacancy, holding in his hand Grey's letter, which seemed to have moved his quiet spirit strangely. Judith's thoughts were much perplexed to read the enigma of cha- racter which had been partially unfolded to her view. With her knowledge of Brent's character, she had expected some gleam of enthusiasm at the prospect of what, as a pastime, had yielded' him such pleasure. His athletic frame, his love for field-sports, and the stirring excitements of out-door life fitted him for the soldier; the determination, the cool bravery which she knew were the distinctive traits of his character, formed the first broad basis for success. Here, she felt, lay a field which opened to him a career of honor which she eagerly welcomed for him. If there was little of the spirit of the pa- triot in her own breast at that time, there was the instinctive thirst of the woman for that tide of a life which promised distinction to one whose name and interests were linked with her own. She had listened attentively while he spoke, and the first feeling of dis- appointment had lightened, as she fancied she saw more into the- quiet but deep strug- gle that was working within him; yet it was a feeling with which her own nature had less sympathy than with the boldly avowed ambition of Stanley Powers. If it was less worthy in its nature, it was certainly one which would meet the largest share of sym- pathy; for, alas I how many of us, if asked the real motive which points our ambition, could attest its purity? And there was a   certain charm to her in the candor with which he had boldly avowed that which most men would havesought to vail in flim- sy disguises, "Surely," she argued, "any ambition is nobler than a want which ever seems, in my eyes, to degrade character." A question of metaphysics which I shall not attempt to argue. Certainly a woman's sympathies go oftenest with him who boldly assumes and maintains even a false proposi- tion, than with him who weakly, or perhaps wisely, deliberates. It is. a shrinking from responsibility which she instinctively con- nects with moral cowardice; or, at any rate, evinces a timidity which, timid herself, she still scorns in those on whose strength she would naturally rely. Every comparison between these two favored the rival who was daily weaningher from all gentler asso- ciations with her husband. The promised visit of Elinor formed food for thought with both. Judith loved her too sincerely not to rejoice at the promise of meeting; mingling with this was a sene of regret that the com- munion which she found so sweet must} be subject to the interruptions of a larger circle. Powers dreaded the grave, searching eyes that belonged to one he instinctively respect- ed, and whose opinions, however widely they might differ from. his own, he knew to be conscientious and sincere. Yet, after all,ehe did not look unfavorably upon an interrup- tion which, while it delayed the sweets of an hour which might have grown insipid, threatened to add the zest of secrecy to his wooing. He had met Elinor frequently since Isa- bel's death, and, while he paid. the respect due to her felings, he had somewhat freely bestowed that confidence, which few with- held from a sympathy so charming as to make even the revelations of pain and morti- fication a luxury. She had perhaps known before that the bond between them was lightly made, and could not marvel that it seemed lightly broken, yet she came to Pine Ridge ill-prepared for the revelation which came to her with pain and with some indig- nation toward both. Her affection for Brent, based upon her intimate knowledge of his character, was strong and deep. She could look with admiration upon the motive which prompted an act which she yet could not  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7518-00000056"/> commend; for she saw all its folly, all the obstacles, whih- neither time- or the stern- eat sense of duty could reconcile. S-he had' vainly puzzled over a' solution to Judith's conduct, never guessing of that by-gone ro- mance of her girlish days, and barely glanc- ing at the-possibility of s passion for Powers. What then had prompted her to this 'mar- riage? - Certainly, rnowing her as she did, she could not associate :it with mean or sor- did motives. On the first evening of her ar- rival She had been still more puzzled. Sure- ly,'she could not love him, yet there seemed much to warrant suh';a belief in her en- deavors to please, her anxious watchfulness over him, and, more than all, in the serenity which belonged-to happiness, and whose secret spring she, of course, did not guess. Gradually some suspicion of the truth dawned upon her, a something which be- trayed- thes startling truth, while it shocked and pained her' beyond expression.- Stie thought long and earnestly' and pityingly before she resolved to-risk the forfeiture of their friendship, sooner than permit that which would only work sorrow and remorse. As the days went by, she became more de- termiined in her purpose, and only awaited the opportunity to speak. The family group had broken up, and Eli- nor, Powers, and Judith had adjourned to the pleasant morning room, which Judith now dignified with the name of studio. She was at work on the picture which Elinor's arrivalhad interrupted, and seemed en- grossed in her occupation. Brent lay on a couch in the veranda, with his absent eyes fixed in thought, while the fingers of his hand played idly with the lon, silky ears of a graceful pointer that lolled beside him. Elinor sat on a low stool at the further -end of the rooNmi while Powers busied himself with a book, from which he occasionally.' turned to offer some remark' to his silent companion. Elinor occasionally raised her eyes to Judith. For some time she saw her apparently intent on her occupation; but at length she paused, and a casual observer might have supposed her duly absorbed in a' question of sky-blue or opal green, but Elinor' knew better. 'It was a strangely expressive face, passing with the quick transitions of. thought from grave to gay, from sadness to   joy. She 'saw the deep brbwft eyes resting on her husband's face, saw the struggle that lent a pitying pathos to tat sweet, serious face shadowed with' the fervency of passion- ate regret, then saw the slow moisture gather within, to be dashed with impetuous hand away. Breakihg in upon her rapt reverie came the words of her companion: ' Is she not' a perfect study There is an interest which even beauty fails to awaken in the rapt reverie, whose Foure one can trace through an eye so clear, so transparent, that it seems to mirror every thought we care to trace. Art has become her passion, yet the art she worships might fail to paint an im- age more in unison with artistic perceptions of grace and beauty. I have seen many a face more strictly beautiful,'rarely one which so combines the spirit's gracfwith the ma- terial form.' She has become to me a perfect study:  '  "She's noble, noble-one to keep Embalmed for dreams of fever's sleep; An eye for nature, tasterefined, Perception swift, and balanced mind, And, more than all, a gift of thought To such a spirit-fineness wrought That, on my ear her language falls As if each word dissolved a spell." For a moment Elinor remained silent, then raising her clear eyes to his, while she paused in' the act of drawing her needle through' the cloth, she said: ' Mr Powers, will you forgive me if I warn you that an interest in one like her is dangerous to your- self in tie extreme?  Of her I will not speak." For a moment Powers colored and seemed abashed by her frankness, but in another he laid his finger between the leaves of his book, and, assuming that air of frank good humor which so well became him, he said: "My dear Mrs; Grey, you must give me credit for some of the larger feelings which belong to humanity, I might say I was a philanthropist, and ministered comfort to a heart craving sympathy and' companion- ship; 'but I will only assume that the poetic temperament inseparable'from the organiza- tion of genius covets the gratification which- the sight of so much beauty yields. I love to see the deepening of the-shadows, the play of light on a brow that Raffaelle might have painted, eyes lighting with the fire that   poets catch from heavenly inspiration. My nature being essentially poetic, you surely  would not deny me the innocent pleasure I indulge, especially when the 'light I see is a light unseen by another,'" and he pointed scornfully to Brent's outstretched figure. Elinor was too much in earnest to smile, and said gravely: "Mr. Powers, you see in scorn what I have learned in sadness-that between husband and wife there is not the feeling which should exist. I am mistaken in your character if you will willfully persist in what can only bring misery upon her. You are a gentleman and a man of honor; moreover, I believe you have a manly regard for her and respect the sentiment you have inspired." He had allowed her to proceed without I interruption; and, seeing by her earnestness  that the subject would not admit of the  light tone which had hitherto characterized 1 it, said: "What would you have me do?  I have felt compassion for her lot. Surely a gem so rare deserves a better setting. I I will not say that your warning finds me to- 1 tally unprepared. I have felt the dangerous c fascination of her presence; yet you, who I appeal to my honor, shall not find me un- willing to conquer myself. If I ever be- I lieved that any strong feeling of friendship a could exist between those of opposite sex,   without bordering on a deeper sentiment, at least on his part, I have learned my error. I give you my word that only pity induced me to linger here when duty would have called me elsewhere." Elinor was pleased with his candor and his ready submission. to her wishes. "You will leave, then-leave immediately. You can. not mistake -her feeling for you. Oh I in pity to both, go!" One look at BreDt- a flash of the old spirit of dislike-and the keen eyes wan- dered to Judith and relaxed. She was lean- ing, with the indolent grace which seemed peculiar to her, against the frame of her can- vas; her soft, dreamy brown eyes gazing upon him, the delicate outline of her oval face turned toward him. Perhaps she guessed that their talk was in some way connected with her; for under her long lashes there gathered a glance mute yet elo- quent, half tenderness, half reproach. For a long moment his gaze rested upon her, then, turning his face away, he laid a hand upon Elinor's arm, and said with hon- est warmth in his voice: "You are right. [ thank you, and will go." No word more passed between them. Elinor felt she could rely upon his promise, nd calmly resumed her occupation.  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7518-00000057"/> CHAPTER XXXIL "TmINGB ill begun strengthen themselves in ill: Mat, not the things that can not be amended."' t..     SHAEsp xPAr .   ,., ,HEN they parted for the night, Powers leant over Judith, and whispered, "I must lee, you to-morrowfarewell!" .And he extended his hand, She. laid her own trem- bling fingers on his outstretched palm, while he pressed them, and, without a glance at Elinor, left the room. On the next morning she appeared at the morning meal with pale cheeks and heavy eyes. -Her serenity of manner was all gone. She wasFby turns. silent and morose, or ner- ous and fretful,  .Chrough. all the,long day Elinor's pitying eyes had followerd her. , , Toward aevening she had, wandered out alone, and Elinor -remained in-doors with a book on- her; knee; but her thoughts were Straying through mazes of doubt and per- plexity. Slowly -the darkness had come down, the crimson light fading from the cur- tained windows, while a light wood-fire burned on the wide, open hearth, where, stretched on a rug in front, lay Rover, his bright eyes fixed upon the blaze. As the evening deepened into the dusk of twilight, Elinor left her seat by the fire' and threw herself on a couch by the deep window, half hid in -the gloom of the room. Judith en- tered and walked with a slow step to the fire. For some moments she remained stand- ing in front of the firelight, its flames flick- ering over her face, Elinor could see that the eyes and brow wore the stern rigidity of mental suffering, while her cheek, where it touched the crimson wrapping as it fell from her head, was pale and colorless. Her small fingers were wreathed together, and  now and then fluttered nervously. Slowly i hereye wandered to Rover, who, looking wistfully in her face, whined as if wishing to express the sympathy he felt. Throw- ing herself down and laying her head on his   neck, she remained gazing through a long, unbroken silence.  , There was so much of bitterness, so much of the sternness of desperation apparent to Elinor's watchful eyes, that she rose, and, coming toward her, laid the soft touch of her fingers caressingly on her head, and said, "Judith, my poor child, what is it "  There is an influence which works, felt but unexpressed, in the silence of night, with the kindly darkness about us, to screen the quivering lip; the falling tear; a sorrow, moved;- at the touch of subtle sympathy, to unburden the grief we feel. For a moment no word issued from the pVle lips, and Eli- nor bent over her and pressed her brow. With a sudden and passionate impulse the dark head was bowed on her bosom, the nervous arms clasped her neck, and she cried: "Elinoinor, nor,  me pity me! I love him! O GodI how dearly. I never knew myself until now. All seems so lost without him! I fancied once I hated him-! How mad, Show foolish I have been!" The gush of her hot tears rained on the bosom that sheltered her poor, flushed face, and a moisture gathered in Elinor's kind eyes as she listened to the thoughtless words of the girl before her. The form she held was pressed closer to her own as she said: M -Cykchild, my poor child, you forget the seit of words like these. If this be the un- happy truth, forget it; try to -put it from you; think of your husband, his kindness, Ihis love for you."  Elinor," she cried passionately, "I hate him, I hate him-and he is my husband  God forgive me, God help me I What is to become of me 1" "Hush, hush I your words are mad and - foolish I Why should you hate him?" s There was no - reply i; and while her hand   still gently passed over the hot brow that now rested -on her knee, and she noted the half sob$ that' burst throu'gh the quivering lips, she was thinkihng, "Why did she'mar- ,ry him?"   '  As if in answer to her unspoken thought, Judith said: "Elinor, I know the World ,sees my misery, 'and I know it judges ine harshy. Perhaps you do too; ' She paused and looked anxiously into the face above hei-own. Turnifig aside, she continued bitterly: "I guessed as much. Evenyou, who knew me sowell-whom   I loved so dearly--could misjudge me; but I have deserved it."  4"Stop!" said Elinor, "do not be unjust. It was but'natural that I could see little in your hasty marriage to indicate love, know- ing his disappointment, and seeing the wide difference between you; but I believed that one day you would trust me with your se- cret, and, moreover, I believed," she 'con- tinued gravely, " that, once his wife, you would endeavor to shut your eyes to his de- fects, and learn to find your happiness in his." "I did, Elinor; indeed, indeed I did. I would have loved him if I could. I tried to do all he wished. I would not read, as I had done before; for I found it- made me more unhappy.  Then he came; he saw all my misery,' which, somehow, grew harder to bear after he came., He taunted me with sinking to his level. He always made the contrast between them :so great. Still I tried to love him; but he never seemed to see. it, or to care; and O Elinor! I wanted companionship. My' life with my father had so ill prepared me for such utter desti- tution of all that could ennoble or improve. His devotion made me shudder at the cold- ness, the unloving tedium of my daily life; and, more than all, it was such humiliation to think that the very gardener that attend- ed my flowers had more in common with me than my husband. He at least read the works which-belonged to his profession; and there .was much in- the associations that study brought, which I could see was mould- ing even his unlettered mind to softness and breadth of thought. I never stumbled over his books in the summer-house, or 'heard him talk over my plants, of their culture   ; and uses, without thinking: 'This rude la- borer has some occupation in' life, which in- volves mind arid heart. He loves his plants, he delights to learn all which can improve their culture.. All lives have a purpose-- what has mine? Turn where I would, all hope seemed shut out from me.' " She paused and ccvered her face with hef hand. Elinor had heard, ah I how pitying- ly, her sad, humiliating confession I "Judith," she said, "was your life all purposeless while you had his happiness in keeping, his honor? My child, you are young, and life may have much in store for you. Certainly, your fate is fixed, and un- alterable to all but guilt and shame. Think thus of it always. I will be your friend." And she bent over her and pressed her bands between her own. There was another silence, while -Judith lay, with shaded- eyes, watching the fire- light, and Elinor was, vaguely guessing at that earlier secret that led to the marriage, Her heart sank within her, and-she trembled for the proud, sensitive nature before her. Only misery and wrong seemed probable Judith knew that Elinor waited for more. It seemed due to her friend, who still trust- ed her; it seemed- due, too, to herself. Breaking 'the silence in a voice low yet calm, and ;unlike the rapid outpouring of the nearer, more real grief, she said: "Long years ago, Elinor, when I was but a child, I loved, or fancied I loved, another. I know now it was but a fancy. The hero whom :I had coined from the romances of many a tale and ballad, investing him with attributes and sentiments not his own, I can now look on with the calm eyes of friendship, and know that a union with him would have brought me no happiness. I can not look without a tinge of pain to the hour in which I learned from himself that he loved another. All the glory and -brightness of earth seemed suddenly to have faded from me. It was the first disap- pointment in a long life of sunshine and gladness. I had never dreamed that aught could be snatched from my hitherto self-in- dulged life. It was -then I first karned something of the sadness which comeshpon us when we find that we are children no longer; that what has brought gladness and joy to the- light hours of childhood can  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7518-00000058"/> come no- more. I: do. not think he ever guessed any thing. of my secret;. but my father did, -and I first realized, then his own ,deep devotion to me. I tleft me paler, sad- der, and without the;power of enjoyment in any thing. I, felt that I might drift on thrpough life, I cared not how or whither.- I know none would have dared then to hint to moe of forgetfulness. It was a bitter pain, and left a void which-was never filled until I met him afterwardwith his wife. Time had only soothed, not, cured me; but with the first touch of his hand, the first sound of his voice, my romance, ended. Let it pass  Later in life I met Stanley Powers, and, contrasting the fervency, the depth of the passion I felt for him, I realized my woman- hood. The part. he, played was unworthy of him, yet it belonged to the b6le of-men of :the world. -I measuredr him by a higher standard, yet, even when he fell below it, I 'could only love. him still. The unhappy circumstances which followed my father's death parted us,- I knew that I could never hope to marry him after that. I knew, too, that, waiving all that, my poverty presented abarrier which he would never seek to over- opme;; yet, feeling this, even this which leems so base, I could forgive him He was luxurious and indolent; it became him well. I would not have robbed him of one attribute that belonged to him, and made ;him, not Stanley-Powers, but my love-the- one being whose heart I coveted. Was this love, Elinor? I think so. I sometimes said: I do not care for him to love me, only let me love him 1' I would have followed him over the world! I would have given up all for him--name and famne, all were valueless without him! I would have been his mis- tress. Ah I there was some sacrifice, but a wife, I said, gains all and loses nothing. I was mad, Elinor; mad with love, and he trampled upon it I That which comprised all of life to me seemed a jest to him I Then I thought I hated him Il What has it all come to? I am a wife, and he-is my friend." She raised her head, pushed back her hair from her flushed face, and smiled bitterly. "This is life, Elinor I This the boon we must take and be thankful for 1 It is more than I can bear"I Her voice had all the   hardness. of despair, and she seemed not to heed- the hot tears that fell froml Elinor's eyes upon her hands. "Life, my poor. child, is more than this. The breath of all time past is still our own I Come how it will, grief and care and pain are old in themselves; the only newness is in our own untried hearts. Is your heart less noble, your spirit less brave, than that of the many who have fretted their brief hour be- fore your own knew a being? Think of hu- man misery through the ages when human love died, that from its ashes might rise something grander, more worthy the Al- mighty. Think of the ebb. and fow of that passion that moaned itself out on Calvary; the human was at last laid down." The low, gentle tones of her voice ceased, and Judith turned her weeping eyes to her, saying: "But I can not do that, Elinor. I am so weak, my resolves seem worth so little. If I could be like you l"And she pressed the' hand she held to her lips. Perhaps Elinor was thinking of that in her own past which the young girl's tale had stirred to life; something which, at some time, all human hearts have known; some- thing of love, and passion, and tenderness-a romance or a dream that lighted the eyes of youth, and yet has power to quicken the pulse and flush the cheek of age I Certainly her voice took a tremulous tone when, drawing the soft, girlish cheek 'to hers, she said: "Judithi do you think any life has been without the pang of disappoinit- ment? Pride and all the safeguards of hu- man will and strength too often prove un- availing, They must give place to a better principle before we learn the strength of Him who is indeed a rock of defense, a strong, tower to his creatures. You will learn this too. You will learn to think kindly and justly of your husband, and you will be happy." "HappyI  O Elinorl you must know there is a void here which can never be filled."' And she laid her hand on her bosom. Elinor. could find no reply to this. Deep- ly in her own breast she felt the sad :truth. The young life before her was indeed blight- edl All the promise of talent and beauty but made her lot the harder. Even the coi- tent which might arise from the chnscious-  ,     ,    ,     ness of duties fulfilled seemied: too: meagre to offer to her thirsty lips; and-she ntly soothed her with :cairsti ...

"You need fear nothing for me," she said, somewhat proudly.  "There is one alterna- tire when despair presents itself."  There was a hardness now on that young  face which made her words seem. only too i earnest, and Elinor cried: "Judith, Judith, E you can never mean that! O my child, my  child, my heart aches for you! Ah! t had I  known- you earlier, that cowardly v thought had never found place in your mind. s Poor, misguided child!"         il Her distress was too evident, and perhaps d its manifestation did more to soften the sterno b spirit than all her previous words had dotng. - "You love me, Elinor, you care flor mit p my loss would distress you.

Elinor did to not believe-her utterly bad; that she placed a   higher-estimate on her courage and princi- thi ple than perhaps it deserved; and a desire to no make her commendation truthful arose with- hei in her.                 do I   Long she knelt beside the true friend she tut had found, speaking sometimes bitterly, aj   a to sometimes regretfully, of the miserable days hed of her otphanhood,; how- her, unloved life had broken her spirit and paved the way for L,- her presehnt sorrows; of all the strange 16d thoughts, the mad questionigs, the' dQubts that had forced thetsbEhres upon her.: "And ars he-found me, Elihor;- the firt words of iW ,nt terest or kindness bhad- heard in many er- months-cam fromhis lips.

I, stirred to warmth and admiration." ,  And with the occasional interruption of I! Judith's eager questions, she related the tale. r which Janet had heard from Powers. As-  she proceeded, she saw that the slumbering interest of the girl was again aroused and s directed to her husband, alas! perhaps to. aL be dissipated in the daylight. i;. - When they parted, she said: "There is a O poitr even more beautiful than that of in- tellect, and which should conlmand our high- est reverence: see in him all the nobility of nature which is his, the pride and sensitive- ness which a calm manner conceals. You are wrong in imputing it to indifference or apathy. The time may come when you will see all his fondness for you, and you will love him." Judith shook her head sadly. "You have comforted me, Elinor, and I thank you, how much I but I know there is nothing for me to look forward to. Good-night!" For a long time Elinor remained buried in thought. Perhaps she ought to have chided, : not consoled; perhaps she had not fulffled her Christian duty in not so doing. Yet I doubt if any course could have so calmed the turbulent spirit of evil, so raised the soul to a just appreciation of the qualities that be-  &#xD;<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7518-00000059"/> lobgedtto it, as the gentle expression of her sympathy, the rrefusal to believe the exteqnt of i W wrotng.       , t Ijbog and fervently she prayed that the young, besutiful spirititight pass unscathed thrbugi:-the0fiery- rrdeal before her.

She would only believe that it would work   out well inithe end. No suspicion rested on her mind that her husband formed the hero of that early romance which had led, to so much evi . Yt,thinking over all that reve- lation, she could find much that seemed pal- liation for error. She knew that youth had often a faith too deep in its own strength, and that marriage was rarely invested, in its eyeswith the sanctity that belonged to it. Here had been one of its mistakes, which time and future events alone could rectify. It was one of, the mysteries which it be- longed not to her to solve. Her heart was deeply pained, for she loved them both, and could feel little hope for the happiness of either.   CHAPTER XXXIIL ' " Tri smiles hypocrisy, thy words deceit."   As the weeks wore on, Judith began to feel the influence of Elinor's character ovet her own. Her thoughts were led away from the one theme on which they had hitherto so dangerously dwelt.. In a few weeks her spirits had, regained their composure, and when the Greys returned to town, Brent and his wife accompanied them. .: Judith had given a promise to 'see Elinor often, and some time elapsed before she met Powers. It was with some determination that she re- solved to meet him as she should, but youth is prone to extremes. Fearing her own re- solves, or led away by the frequent lapses- of repugnance to him wlich she had not yet overcome, her bow scarcely amounted to more than the coldest nod of recognition. Powers was not one to brook coldness or neglectL. She turned in passing and saw the fiery indignation that blazed in his eves, and her heart -failed' her. What a miserable coward she 'was becoming  He hesitated for an instant, but her husband was with her, and, turning on his heel, he pursued his way. 'Yet Judith had caught sight of the sardonic smile that hovered over his haughty lip, and she trembled. She was the first to propose a' return home, and hurried to her room. Alas I was this happinessI What would she have given now to return to the quiet of her life before he came I Yet surely she had been happy with him before Elinor came, happy, too, without sin or shame. She half-regretted the purpose which Eli- nor had aroused within her. Life seemed so short to spend in contests.1 It was so easy to yield I Long, miserable hours she lay, until a step in the hall aroused her. It was Brent, and springing up, she hastily arranged her dress and met him at the door. To his careless inquiry, elicited by her flushed face, X she answered that her head ached; "Will you go, to the ball: to-night?" he,   a  asked. She hesitated, and he continted, tr I should like you to go." a  She never refused an expressed wish of o his, and replied in the affirmative. r  "Very well," he said.  : ' will wait for i you in the study, and have witne and coffee I laid there for you. At what hour shall I I say?" "Ten will be early enough," she replied, and, with some relief, she saw him close the * door, and heard him enter the study a fe* moments afterward. 'She did not want to go to this ball; she 3 knew  she should meet Stanley, and she t feared him. It was half in her mind to go ,down and tell Brent that she would not go, and she reached the door before she thought, "What excuse can I offer?": It was more than an hour after dark when she rangfor her nimaid to dress her for the- boll. A  strange sense of depression was upon her.  She was in no mood for gayety, yet, when her toilet was at length completed, andsshe stood looking at herself in the mir. ror by- the flashing gas-lights, the roses blooimed brightly on: her cheeks as she thought: "He will see me, and he can not be cross to me when I look so pretty." She had forgotten herself now and the picture before her, and stood with a *half smile on her parted lips and a gliminer of happy, triumphant light resting in her dark, shining eyes. Turning from it, she tripped lightly down the stairs. Brent Was smoking on the open window-seat, and turned to shut out the night-air before he surveyed her. He was pleased, she saw that, though' he said nothing.  She was in gay spirits now, gleeful almost, and walked up and down the room rapidly, as was her custom when ex- cited.  While Brent drank his coffee, she poured outas glass of amber wine, held it to the light, and drank it off. It was getting  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7518-00000060"/> late, and, carefully wrapping herself in a shawl, she followed her husband down the stairs, Her first hurried glance around the room had shown her that Powers was not there. 'The first thought was one of intense relief, the next of disappointment; yet hQw could he guess this when, entering some moments later, he saw her all smiles and animation in the centre of the room? For a few moments h^t p-.od:just outside the door, with folded arms, watching her. Wa lshe .acting apart, nd  ;ing with bhim.  In thbemraing he had thought: '"his i Elior's ;wok; she has f'r'4ten ed her into good ,behavior, nd .the foq ish child h sgoveract e her part; friepd- ship never wears. so cold a bow."

He had seen him too, and, bowing over her with some smiling com- ,pliment, retired. Brent's lips were very white, and there was a cold light in his eyes when he turned them upon her which she had never seen befpre.

"The hypocrite " thought Brent, as he looked into the pale face before him; yet he felt a slight pang as he thought: "If even now she had trusted me, I could forgive her -I "Will you take me out of this crowd i" she said, "I feel faint." The hand he drew within his arm was quite cold. He smiled bitterly and bore her into the refreshment-room. In a few mo- ments he :saw her whirling in the dance, ap- patentlygay and unconcerned. AlI through the evening:his eyes never left her, and still her spirits never seemed to flag. When the stars were paling in the east, she turned with seeming reluctance at his bidding. How could he guess the bound of delight with which her heart obeyed that summons I How guess the wretched, mi- serable feeling with which those long hours had been dragged throughl Once in the carriage, she leant far back to hide from the flashes of light of the street lamps her hag- gard cheeks and swollen eyes. By the time they reached home, she laid her hand calm- 1 ly on her husband's arm and ascended the t stairs. During that silent drive she had t been strangely perplexed. , "He 'must know all," she had thought, i looking -at his hbard face; yet that belief ( was staggered at the first word he spoke. E -His manner was go strange, so cold, so t unlike any thing she had ever known of him r before-l Onemomentary impulse there had t been to say, "Brent, that evil man has t come between us; save me -from   him " t but the -moment had passed by in hesita- tion.                  y He never sought confidences. She might s find him coldly unwinding -her arms, or chid. s ing her in, that calm, measured voice; or he p might injure Powers. He was fierce enough ii somtimes to do this.   He disliked him; si and, cruel as:he was to her,:she loved him I   a loved him better than she did her husband, 3 and could not injure him. When they came "nto the light, yrith still that undefined ^ dread upon hMr, she came up to him and stood beside him. He did not repulse her, ' and she sat on his knee. She was beginning to feel quite sorry now that she had not trusted him. - She put her bare, white arms around his neck and lean- ed her cheek against his own. He did not shrink away from the clinging arms, though he might feel that a serpent's coil was not more deadly. She was talking to him now; telling himiof the ball, her dark, bright eyes smiling up into his. He heard little of what she was saying. He was -thinking what a traitor she was I She was his wife, too; and this was the wo- man he had married-she would be the mo- ther of his children-and they would be like her I It seemed a marvel that he bore those twining arms. about him; that he did not rise and shake her from him I The little hand that lay on his arm had better have thrust a dagger into his heart than clasped his fingers with that soft touch! He remembered a time before she had met Powers, when she looked pale and ill, and never smiled at him, or sought him out. She was true then, and did not love him or lie to him I But she had grown tender of late; and now in bitterness, mad- ness, he awoke to the remembrance of all the caresses she had lavished upon him, and that until now he had never seemed to no- tice. You see he was quite pitiless now. Too young to pardon any thing in youth; too strictly moral to -admit any excuse; and so steeled his heart against her, and never paused to think that he, too, was now act- ing a lie, and not giving her the grace she surely deserved l  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7518-00000061"/> CHAPTER XXXIV. "MiNs after-life I What is mine after-life? My da Is closed I the gloom of night'is come I A hopeless darkness settles .o'er my fate!" JOSAEA BAILLII.   THE next morning Brent left the house quite early, and Judith was alone. How willfully he was wronging her she never guessed.: Sh e loved her husband as a brother or friend-.:as one who had earned her gratitude. Her nature was affectionate; it came so naturally to her to caress any she cared for I A thought of herself in the light in which he viewed her never entered her mind. He had gone off without: an unkind word, and she sat among thpe flowers in her con- servatory-not reading or sketching, but in* dulging in that languid pensiveness so grace- ful and so becoming to her.' She was think- ing of Powers, sometimes with a guilty I pang-of Elinor, but never of her husband. She never intended any wrong to him'; she never had any strong feeling of dislike to him, unless he came between her and the companionship of Powers.  Lying there now in her warm wrappings, with a shade of thought on her brow, she feels-more than sees Stanley coming-through the half-closed door of the conservatory. She'never moved; he liked her best so. He came and sat at her feet and looked at her. His face grew pleasanter then, and, touching the white tips of her fingers, he said softly: "I came here to chide, but am quite vanq'uished;- williyou forgive my harshness F' "You play the tyrant even with those who love you," she said reproachfully. "Even with those whom I love," he said gallantly. "Come! the homage is more worth your acceptance. You'd never love a silken slave." Where were Elinor's warnings now? Was this the platonic tone to which he had bound himself? Judith had a guilty consciousriess of wrong, and skillfully led the conversation to generalities. He was reading to her now-   in that deep, full-toned voice\she knew and loved so iell. She did not heed the read- ing.' There was; harmony enough in the voice, pleasure enough in lying with shaded eyes watching him, with the sunlight lying in golden patches over the pavement, and the lulling odor of hot-house blossoms in thb air. Ah ' if life was all like this I She awoke from her dreaming' to the words he was pouring into her ear. Deceived by her quietude, he- had believed her listening ini rapt attention to him. Not one word had reached her ear until the passionate tremor in his voice awoke her to the gush of poetic fervor in which breathed a tenderness not the bard's.; She heard it;' she knew that in every word was breathed an insult--in every mo- ment of her silence lay sin-! Pity her in her youth 1 Thiis was happiness-'the most exquisite in a woman's life--when the lips she loves echo the passion in her own breast. ,Every impiose of her nature then was hi,s. Honor, truth, religion, were- forgotten. In one rapid glance -she saw herself happy in his love I All his sternness was forgotten. What- was life or the world's opinion to compare with his love? - What can any young girl know of, shame and remorse V How- quickly all this passed through her mind I In another moment all that was most womanly came back to, her. The eyes that looked into his wore a glance of reproach that he felt keenly. She had given him all that was best and worthiest in her nature, and it had been valueless in his eyes. He was half shamed, half angry. A man can never understand so seeming an inconsistency; yet he knew that he had ventured quite far enough for the present. -What' a revulsion of feeling was hers when he left her I She had risen and stood look. ing after him. She knew now that she loved   him; loved as a true woman loves--only once in a lifetime I . She could never deceive herself again, ,never trust her resolution. The thought of her husband was intolerable to her. She shuddered as she remembered how Stanley had crushed that little hand to his lips, and she had submitted to the cat ress. Ah! she would never kiss her husband again I It was the first time in all her life that she had known a sense of degradation. Elinor-would never believe in her if she knew all; and this was not the end; not unless providence would stand  between them. Ah I if she dared trust her husband. But she could not. He would believe her more guilty than she was. And Powers-- the thought of him terrified her. She did not sink down and weep, as she would have done once, but there was a dreary sense of - helplessness in her breast, and a frightened, childish prayer for protection rose, in her  heart. Any thing-even deatfi-would be prefer- able to sin; and she felt that she could never conquer--that temptation would en- v gulf her so surely as it came I You see she 1 was but a child; an untutored one at that I 1 No motherly counsels had been hers!  No t thought, no habit of her life taught her c where lay the Christian's anchor, and how . sure a one it is I Had her husband stood before her then with angry brow and livid v lip, she would have had no thought of de. fi nial. She might only have said drearily: n "Let me go away, Nevil; I am not worthy  M to be your wife."  Even now her mind was c quite made -up;  and-her purpose never fal- 'c tered as she wrapped herself up and went in o search of Elinor. -           sl No  suspicion of all this had reached Eli- tl nor. The few times she had seen Judith all m had seemed well. They had conversed qui- tl etly upon their favorite topics; and now, w when the door was flung wide open, and Ju- he dith stood before her with that hard brow sl and a  coldness in her eyes that Elinor had si8 learned to dread, she could only sink upon tl her. seat with a strange, sickening sensation Sb of dismay.  In another moment she went ut forward, took the two cold hands in hers, se and kissed her.             of  "Don't 1" said Judith drearily, unwrap- re   !y 'ping Elinor's arms, " don't pity me, Elinor I re I am unworthy of your pity I Don't caress n. or love me-I can't bear it!" le  Elinor would not reproach her. She d could not believe that the worst bad come. "o "Elinor," she broke in, "I know' now b- how false I have been. Hush don't inter- rupt me. I am going away-away from all d who love me!" i "Not from him, O Judith "'.' i. Judith shuddered: "I could never let him e kiss me again I I have been cowardly, but t not base. I am a coward now; I could not i meet his eyes. I have deceived him, Elinor,  though I deceived myself first.; I did not rknow before, but it seems degrading now to - live with him. I will leave him.". I- "Judith," said Elinor firmly, "you will 3do nothing of the sort. Where is your reli- gion?  How dare you think so lightly of the vows you made before the Almighty? Surely, surely, my child, you are exagge- rating your sin." She said this anxiously. "It is you., Elinor, who do not know' what you are saying. It is too late to turn back. He kissed me, Elinor; I did not let him; I would not. Surely you believe this. But he has held me in his arms- only for a moment--and/I know now that my husband-never must." To say that Elinor was shocked or grieved would be to convey little idea of what she felt. She walked the room rapidly for some moments. A prayer was in her heart for wisdom and strength. Judith stood quite calmly, eyeing her without a word of depre- cation;  but when Elinor at length'came over to, her and put her arms around her, she did not repulse her. She had come there with, her mind firmly made up, , She must leave her husband. She did not say that it would be to go to her lover;. nor would she. But she knew that if, in her miserable flight, Stanley came to her, she would fall hopelessly. To her keen in- sight of character Elinor was indebted for the estimate which she formed of Judith. She felt that her weakness, lay most in the unworthy estimate in which she held her- self. /She had no belief in her own strength of purpose, and there was no sentiment of religion to supply the place of such strength,  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7518-00000062"/> It .had fallen -to her lot to-deal with-this na- tjare; .t must be done!tenderly and skill- fully.

The western sky was red and cold, and the stars trembled in the dewy night before Judith left her. fElinor hoped -that Brent had not- yet waked:to 'his misery, but she was not destinedrtobe so deceived long. It needed but one- glance at that white, suffer- -ing face, usually so calm,totell her all. He spoke to her-quietly, and waited while- her children remained around them, saying little, but giving no evidence of what his errand at that hour of the night might portend. The :children at length dismissed, Elinor made some comnionplace observation, upon which he abruptly broke: "Elinor, how long has this been going on?" She felt it was worse than useless to seem to:misunderstand him; but she hesitated, at a losshow to reply. "I am sure you know it; perhaps others do, and have made a jest of my blindness. They are right; I have been blind. I trust- ed her, 'Elinor, and -she has deceived me! She has lied -to me, daily, hourly; shall I forgive it? Do you ,think I will?" "Hush :Nevil, you are wronging her; you do'not know all." "I -know enough. Why else should she ,fear -him.; :is she wanting in spirit? I' gave her ,the opportunity to claim my protection, and she smiled in my face, as some child might, and lied to me. Hypocrite I does she think to deceive me?" It seemed useless to contend with the storm of ipassion that was sweeping over him. "As for him,' he continued -slowly, "I will kill -him!" He was standing under he -gas-light when he said this. He ,seemed suddenly calmed, and the .words ameo slowly through -his white lips. There wasno acting here. Eli- nor knew that he was just the man 'to do-it She had seen him face danger before $ she knew -the nerve that lay in that sluggish   spirit. Her own face was quite white, and her lips trembled when she laid her hand on his arm and said: "Hush I Nevil, you will never do that-never without cause." A sudden- faintness came over her, and she tightened her clasp on his arm. He saw it, and said gently: "What a brute IX have been; forgive me, Elinor. Of course not without cause, and I have none, you know." ,He said this ^o wistfully that Elinor's eyes filled.. "God forbid, Nevil, Gpd forbid!" Both were silent through deep feeling.   Elinor longed to comfort him, yet how? How strangely the fate of these two seemed to have fallen into her hands! yet not by chance, she knew that. She dared not shrink from the trust, however painful. It is so much more difficult to deal with a man than-with a woman; yet here the strength was not her own, but the victory, however won, was hers to-night He was quiet and patient enough when he bent over his sleep- ing wife that night, while Elinor was pray- ing, in her own home, -for both.  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7518-00000063"/>  .HAPTER XXXV. "WE are parted, and there rolls A flood of headlong fate between our souls, Whose darkness severs us to all eternity." '   WEARY weeks went by, while Brent wan- dered -abdut more listless than ever, seeming to care for nothing. No reproach passed his lips, but none would Judith- have felt more keenly than that ghost-like face, with its dull eyes and pale, compressed lips. It haunted her, sleeping or waking, and she had roused more than once to find it bent close over her own. This could not last forever. Her hours were spent in moody abstractions; in fierce, bitter invectives, when even her best friend must have shrunk from her; in long, solitary rambles, from which' she returned sometimes tearful -and sad, sometimes wildly excited. What could he think of her? His patience gave way at last, and she learned all he thought of her. She took it more quietly than he had thought for, only crying out: "And you have thought this of me for months, and never said it I Who is the traitor? I never deceived you, Nevil. You were kind to me, and I wished to make you happy if I could. It was an innocent deception, but it is no longer needed, thank God for thatl"And she had gone out' with her hand over her heart. He did not like her calmness; he felt that he had better have struck her than said what he had. She was not in her room when he went to seek her, and, with a sudden thrill, he went down the stairs. There was a light in the study, and, looking through the door, he saw her holding a glass in her hand. She was not looking at it, but he could see her tearless eyes, and her lips were moving. With a quick step he stood beside her and grasped her hand. "I What madness is this?" he said sternly. She struggled to free her hand, crying sul- lenly: "Leave me alone, let me die!" He dashed the glass, on the floor, shiver- ing it to atoms, locked the door of the closet, and put the key in his pocket.   "If it is me you are wishing to get rid of, there is an easier way-I will leave you." His lips trembled, and she knew he was quite broken down, but there was no pity in her then. She turned from the room and fled down the stairs and out into the garden. Many and many a night after that she lay out in rain and fog and dew with a longing for death I She never thought of any thing more than that death was preferable to sin and shame. She had no intention of wrong- ing her husband more than she had already, but she had not the courage to face her troubles. She never cared to see Powers; and when she did, there was more pain than pleasure in the meeting. -But death did not come to her, -and, after a night spent out of doors, she would come in, with her wet gar. ments clinging about her, and look at the warm blood creeping under the clear olive of her cheek, look where it throbbed and leapt in her quick pulse, watch the muscular power in that slender arm' when she clinched her little hand, and think how strong Life was within her I All this was brought to a sudden close, however; and one night in mid-winter, when Elinor was think- ing of them and hoping that all was working right, she started to see Judith burst into her room. She was strangely excited, but this was better than to see her as she was sometimes, and Elinor soon learned what had brought her. "It is all at an end now, Elinor. My own mother I oh I to think of that I' And she covered her face with her hand. Elinor looked at her in amazement. "Ah I let me think, and I will tell you all, but it seems so like a dream  He was with me, Elinor, talking, as he often does, so beautifully of books and poetry and painting, and then be began to talk to-me of myself, to upbraid me for my coldness to him, saying that a life thus spent was worthless. I do not ?o   know' what more he intended to urge; he was holding my hand in his, and the plead- ing was more in his eyes and'voi6e than in his words, of which I never heard the half; when suddenly I saw'his face grow white, the hands, that held mine; were col6, and he rose to his feet like one in va dream.

She was very pale, and to rmy amazement I heard him speak: 'Ra- chel, can this be true' ' "Stanley,' she cried, ' was this bitterness left formes at the last?' Where sooner might I not have hoped to meet you? Could you not have spared her for my sake' F "What was the meaning of all this? In a few moments she said: ' If you ever cast a thought to her whose life you blighted; if, in 'all the past, when you have idly dallied with woman's heart, there has remained one spot pure and true which you have conse- crated to that early, boyish love-oh t by that tie, I beseech you, spare my child I' "She had clasped her hands; her sweet, pale face, with the soft, brown eyes, so full of pleading, was turned toward him; and he was moved through all his being I ' Rachel, I am not utterly bad. 1 believed you dead, as all the world has done.

' "That fair, sweet face, with its golden hair m and gentle eyes, was my mother  And through all these long years I had never a guessed it I I turned from her and hid my s face to weep. She looked pained, but said I gently: ' You will give me a hearing, my d child, and judge between us?' And then, ii Elinor, I learned it all. How her lot had s been like mine; that Stanley, then a mere- f youth, had loved her; and that my father, Y upon whom she cast no reproach, had driven e her from him.   -"When she tol- me how, through all - thoselong years, she had hid the truth from i him, I cried' out against her: 'And you. ; left him with that miserable lie blistering -in * his heart,' I cried, 'and that made him what he Wasl My father, my poor, wronged fa- - ther'    : "A pink flush came over her pale face then, and she said: 'It was I who was I wronged.'  "'YouI II- said fiercely...' You did love ianother;- he: knew its and you let him think worse of you than you deserved. Do not blame him.' "I told her then how he had taken me, his little-girl,- by the hand, and shown me a grave-my mother's grave--and wept, and with wondering eyes -I had seen the great tears rolling down that stem face. She knew-then that he had loved her, and how his pride had suffered. She wept, and said: 'I have done wrong, but not knowingly. Forgive me, Judith, my daughter; do-not steel your heart against your poor mother!' "And I did not, Elinor, only after that I seemed to see my own duty more clear- ly.  While she talked to me of all her struggles and temptations, I was thinking, 'Perhaps Nevil thinks as badly of me;' and the duty that in another appeared so plain came home to me. That night I went to Brent and determined to tell him all. It was not easy to do, for heseemed colder than ever. He had seen Stanley leave the house, and I knew what he was thinking of me; but I was brave enough then, with such a lesson before me of the wrong that might grow out of concealment. When I said, 'Nevil,' he only raised his eyes and turned them slowly on me, but made no reply. ' Nevil,' I said humbly, 'I have done very wrong, will You forgive me?' "He would not answer me; but I began again: 'I have been bad enough, but you shall not think worse of me than I deserve. I never loved you, Nevil, and I know you did not care for me. We both did wrong; it was a great mistake, and we have both suffered for it. Do not be angry with me for telling you that I loved some one else. You know that already, but I never intend- ed any greater wrong.'

All this was t a matter of precaution, and few believed in the reality of the events that were moving t around them e Few there were who did not y look: reluctantly to a severance of the Union, e and cling madly to the belief that our fears of a rupture would be groundless. Only the t] young and thoughtless looked with pleasure I upon the evidences which betokened a neces- . sary preparation for war. From many care- si less lips the unmeaning terms "coopera- tion," secession," were bandied; yet it was S a season of sore trial, of earnest, prayerful 0 supplication for wisdom  to the old and at thoughtful inhabitants of the South. On Ji   the: fourth of March Mr. Lincoln delivered - his inaugural address. We all know the acontentsiofr that- elaborately unmeaning Aad- dress, and how little hope it held out to the South of any-- adjustment of her difficulties. It disappointed our friends in the North no less than it did us. The time for action had now arrived, and would admits of no delay,. A wise precaution had rendered prompt ac- tion feasible. Already, one after another, the Southern States had called their conven- tions and passed the ordinance of secession. There was no- retreat, had it been desired, but all hesitation on that point was speedily decided. Our first real military movement was the taking of Fort Sumter. Here again our victory was a bloodless one. The flag of secession now waved over every fort in the South; our streets were thronged with soldiers, and nothing was heard or talked of but military events. But a deeper, holier feeling than enthu- siasm thrilled through all the Southern land when her first blood was shed. Her altars were consecrated then, her people were knit together by one common bond-- stronger than life-more abiding than death. After the battle of Manassas, which more than verified the boastful prophecies of our young Wellingtons and Napoleons, military. events- rapidly followed one another, and, North and South, the people realized that the war was an earnest one. Powers and Brent :had both joined the army of General Beauregard in Tennessee, where Powers soon rose to the rank of Colonel. Our victory at Manassas had roused the South to the acme of warlike enthusiasm. Our men felt armed with a-tenfold strength against their foes; and when the threatened campaign was opened in Tennessee, we wait-  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7518-00000065"/> ed impatiently for news of another Bull Run. It was at the close of that terrible battle of Shiloh, when the field was our own, and the enemy had taken refuge in their gunboats, that we again take up the thread of our story. A victory it could not be called which had cost us so much; yet the troops were wild with enthusiasm, and gathered around their tent-fires to recount their adventures. The long lines of hospital- tents stretched their'white tops against the dusky woods, and within them were cou- rgeous women who -never flinched as they bound- the lint to ghastly wounds, and staid their tears to soothe the dying moans of the ,heroes in that bloody battle. / Kneeling by a Wounded soldier is a slight, dark form winding deftly the bandage about his broken arm under the direction of a sur- geon I Near by on a pallet lay two men; one, a mere lad, with a bloody-linen wrap- ped :about" his head, arid the hot flush of' fever on his young cheek where the down had not yet sprung. He is leaning on his elbow, listening ea- gerly to the grim soldier by his side; and the nurse, never ceasing her work, hears the same homely tale fromt the rough lips of the mountain soldier. "You see, our regiment had beehn standing there all the morning idle, and for the last two hours a battery on a hill in front of us had been knocking down our fellows right and left. It seemed hard to stand and see the man on your right and left go-down, and not know when your turn was to come. I could see our Colonel bit- ing his mustache, and I knew what- he was thinking; but presently General Beauregard came riding down the line. He held the co. lors of one of the broken regiments in his hand. He rode- directly up to our Colonel, and said: 'Colonel Powers, you will take that battery on the hill that is doing so much damage. I will order up the--- regiment to support you.' He turned to us then, saying, while his eagle eye ran over the line, 'Boys, the- honor will be yours of taking that battery.' I guess the cheer we gave him was all the answer he wanted, as, he turned and galloped across the field. It seemed hot work to march six hundred yards up-hill and take a battery on theb sum- mit; but when our Colonel took off his hat   and said, 'Boys, follow mel' we did it. You see, we didn't love our Colonel, but we feared him; and if he had told us to follow him to hell, we'd have done it; for he was brave as a lion, and never sent his men to a danger he did not share. Some of us had followed him in Western Virginia, when he was only a captain, and we knew him. Well, at the word we sent up a cheer all along the line, and broke into a double quick, which soon carried us almost to the cannon's mouth; and then we saw a body of cavalry and one of infantry moving upon us from either side. The battery in front was still belching at us, and every step now was over a dead comrade., Our Colonel saw it all; he looked back, and saw nothing of the promised support; he saw his regiment, a handful of resolute men, still rushing on and cheering, and his black face got blacker yet, while the oaths came pouring in- a volley through his 'clinched teeth. We saw what was up then; and when he shouted, L Back, my men 1' we knew there was no time to be lost. We hadn't made many steps when I saw him throw up his hand and fall. We caught him, and his first words were, 'Bear me to the rear, boys, it, is all up with me!' When we laid him down in one of the am- bulances, he said: 'Now go back and finish this business; we'd have-taken that battery if--' I did not stay to hear the rest, or to see him die. He was shot through the body, and I knew he would die hard. They took him off to the tents. I meant to find him out when the fight was over, but this prevented m6,". and he laid his hand on the broken leg. "General Beauregard led us in the next charge; and we struck the hard- er for thinking of the brave man we had left out there dying 1' This was the tale the nurse heard. Her work was over here; and she went on from tent to tent in .that long line that stretched in the moonlight; but she found him at last I The curtain of the tent was lifted away to give him air, the surgeon sat beside him, and a rough man-nurse was wiping the moisture from his brow. She took her place beside him. Yes, he was dying hard I She could hear every breath as it labored hiss- ingly between his clinched teeth; yet even now the iron will was strong enough to con-   quer the death pang. She bent over him and touched his brow with her trembling lips. The dim eyes opened wide, and into them flashed a glance so full of happiness-- of blissful-rapture-that it lingered on the dull clay when all was over. She saw the look - she never heard the cry-- feeble, tre. mulous with unutterable joy, that thrilled all through the by-standers-"Janet!"'. Wandering  out over that battle field where the dead lay piled on the plains of Shiloh, she saw sometimes a living form among the dead--a brother, perhaps, or a- father - clasping in their arms all that was i left them now of the idols that were broken on their country's altar. There was no future for her now She 1 knew that on the morrow it would be laid t down in that lonely grave on the wild Ten- X nesseean hills. But the present called her, and she went I To many a battle-field in m the South, through that long and bloody i contest, she bent her footsteps; unmindful "   n of toil, or suffering, or want; tending the 5 sick, bearing the messages of the dying to 3 those distant loved ones who were yet un- - conscious: of their loss; speaking gentle 3 words of comfort and resignation to those poor, maimed ones whose pantings after fame-and glory were thus cut short.

Who shall say what thoughts or memories haunted his dying hour? If the deepest, tenderest, holiest love of woman;- if her hallowed tears can redeem, her prayers sanctify, his redemption was won I  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7518-00000066"/> CHAPTER XXXVII. #YW it may be more lofty courage dwells Ia one weak heart which bsrves an adverse fate, Than his whose ardent soul indigant. swells, Warmed by the fight."

At length in her many I wanderings she met Judith, Her husband was still living, but alas! life seemed all that was left him. He had fallen leading a cavalry charge 'gallantly against the enemy; and after an hour or two, when the battle was over, he had been dragged out from under his dead horse crippled, wounded, and disfiguredl A long and painful confinement had reduced him to almost entire helplessness, and his quiet, cheerful spirit had chafed at the hard fate that bound him to inertness when his bleeding country called for all her sons. Thrown thus-upon the tenderness and compassion of his wife, he had found an un- looked-for support and affection. The poor, maimed soldier, whose youth had been pre- maturely wrested from him; whose temper, soured by his misfortunes, had grown irri- table; whose manly beauty was all gone, was in her eyes only a martyr. She called him her " poor, maimed hero ;" sat by Eli- nor, with her hand clasped in hers, and, with an eager tremble in her voice, a glow on her cheek, and tears of deep emotion trembling on her lashes, told the tale of his daring and heroism. He was sacred to her now. His ghastly wounds, his crippled limbs, were a daily memorial of his deeds, When least attractive to others, he became invested in her eyes with a love and veneration which   his beauty and his proud manhood could never have won. Upon the transformation perceptible in Judith, Elinor could look with pride and gratitude. The once fiery spirit was tempered and subdued; the egotism had vanished in a deep and absorbing active interest in her country and her people; while, more than all, there shone in the sweet, bright eyes a light of spiritual content serene and deep and full of peace! It hardly needed her loving assurance, with the tightening clasp of her hand, to tell Elinor of the change that had come to her life. "And to you, under God, I owe it all, Elinor, dear Elinorl The light you gave me grew stronger after a while. I saw what it had done for you. This, I said, is reli- gion. With a mind as lofty, an ambition as strong, with passions as deep, I felt that a wide gulf rolled between us. The purity of character I so reverenced in-you had its foundation in something higher than the morality which governed mine.
