               <p>So! I let fall the curtain; he was dead. For at least half an hour I had stood
                  there with the manuscript in my hand, watching that face settling in its last
                  stillness, watching the finger of the Composer smoothing out the deeply furrowed
                  lines on cheek and forehead,—the faint recollection of the light that had perhaps
                  burned behind his childish eyes struggling up through the swarthy cheek, as if to
                  clear the last world's dust from the atmosphere surrounding the man who had just
                  refound his youth. His head rested on his hand—and so satisfied and content was
                  his quiet attitude, that he looked as if resting from a long, wearisome piece of
                  work he was glad to have finished. I don't know how it was, but I thought, oddly
                  enough, in connection with him, of a little schoolfellow of mine years ago, who
                  one day, in his eagerness to prove that he could jump further than some of his
                  companions, upset an inkstand over his prize essay, and, overcome with
                  mortification, disappointment, and vexation, burst<pb n="6-7"
                     xml:id="VAC7187-00000004"/> into tears, hastily scratched his name from the
                  list of competitors, and then rushed out of doors to tear his ruined essay into
                  fragments; and we found him that afternoon lying on the grass, with his head on
                  his hand, just as <emph>he</emph> lay now, having sobbed himself to sleep.</p>
               <p>I dropped the curtains of the bed, drew those of the window more closely, to
                  exclude the shrill winter wind that was blowing the slant sleet against the
                  clattering window-panes, broke up the lump of cannel coal in the grate into a
                  bright blaze that subsided into a warm, steady glow of heat and light, drew an
                  arm-chair and a little table up to the cheerful fire, and sat down to read the
                  manuscript which the quiet man behind the curtains had given me. Why shouldn't I
                  (I was his physician) make myself as comfortable as possible at two o'clock of a
                  stormy winter night, in a house that contained but two persons besides my German
                  patient—a half-stupid serving-man, doubtless already asleep down-stairs, and
                  myself? This is what I read that night, with the comfortable fire on one side, and
                  Death, holding strange colloquy with the fitful, screaming, moaning wind, on the
                  other.</p>
               <p>As I wish simply to relate what has happened to me (thus the manuscript began),
                  what I attempted, in what I sinned, and how I failed, I deem no introduction or
                  genealogies necessary to the first part of my life. I was an only child of parents
                  who were passionately fond of me—the more, perhaps, because an accident that had
                  happened to me in my childhood rendered me for some years a partial invalid. One
                  day (I was about five years old then), a gentleman paid a visit to my father,
                  riding a splendid Arabian horse. Upon dismounting, he tied the horse near the
                  steps of the piazza instead of the horseblock, so that I found I was just upon the
                  level with the stirrup, standing at a certain elevation. Half as an experiment, to
                  try whether I could touch the horse without his starting, I managed to get my foot
                  into the stirrup, and so mounted upon his back. The horse, feeling the light
                  burden, <emph>did</emph> start, broke from his fastening, and sped away with me on
                  his back at the top of his speed. He ran several miles without stopping, and
                  finished by pitching me off his back upon the ground in leaping a fence. This fall
                  produced some disease of the spine, which clung to me till I was twelve years old,
                  when it was almost miraculously cured by an itinerant Arab physician. He was
                  generally pronounced to be a quack, but he certainly effected many wonderful
                  cures, mine among others.</p>
               <p>I had always been an imaginative child; and my long-continued sedentary life
                  compelling me (a welcome compulsion) to reading as my chief occupation and
                  amusement, I acquired much knowledge beyond my years.</p>
               <p>My reading generally had one peculiar tone: a certain kind of mystery was an
                  essential ingredient in the fascination that books which I considered interesting
                  had for me. My earliest fairy tales were not those unexciting stories in which the
                  good genius appears at the beginning of the book, endowing the hero with such an
                  invincible talisman that suspense is banished from the reader's mind, too well
                  enabled to foresee the triumph at the end; but stories of long, painful quests
                  after hidden treasure—mysterious enchantments thrown around certain persons by
                  witch or wizard, drawing the subject in charmed circles nearer and nearer to his
                  royal or ruinous destiny—strange spells cast upon bewitched houses or places, that
                  could be removed only by the one hand appointed by Fate. So I pored over the misty
                  legends of the San Grail, and the sweet story of "The Sleeping Beauty," as my
                  first literature; and as the rough years of practical boyhood trooped<pb n="8-9"
                     xml:id="VAC7187-00000005"/> up to elbow my dreaming childhood out of existence,
                  I fed the same hunger for the hidden and mysterious with Detective-Police stories,
                  Captain Kidd's voyages, and wild tales of wrecks on the Spanish Main, of those
                  vessels of fabulous wealth that strewed the deep sea's lap with gems (so the
                  stories ran) of lustre almost rare enough to light the paths to their secret
                  hiding-places.</p>
               <p>But in the last year of my captivity as an invalid a new pleasure fell into my
                  hands. I discovered my first book of travels in my father's library, and as with a
                  magical key unlocked the gate of an enchanted realm of wondrous and ceaseless
                  beauty. It was Sir John Mandeville who introduced me to this field of exhaustless
                  delight; not a very trustworthy guide, it must be confessed—but my knowledge at
                  that time was too limited to check the boundless faith I reposed in his narrative.
                  It was such an astonishment to discover that men, black-coated and black-trousered
                  men, such as I saw in crowds every day in the street from my sofa-corner (we had
                  moved to the city shortly after my accident), had actually broken away from that
                  steady stream of people, and had traversed countries as wild and unknown as the
                  lands in the Nibelungen Lied, that my respect for the race rose amazingly. I
                  scanned eagerly the sleek, complacent faces of the portly burghers, or those of
                  the threadbare schoolmasters, thinned like carving-knives by perpetual sharpening
                  on the steel of Latin syntax, in search of men who could have dared the ghastly
                  terrors of the North with Ross or Parry, or the scorching jungles of the Equator
                  with Burckhardt and Park. Cut off for so long a time from actual contact with the
                  outside world, I could better imagine the brooding stillness of the Great Desert,
                  I could more easily picture the weird ice-palaces of the Pole, waiting, waiting
                  forever in awful state, like the deserted halls of the Walhalla for their slain
                  gods to return, than many of the common street scenes in my own city, which I had
                  only vaguely heard mentioned.</p>
               <p>I followed the footsteps of the Great Seekers over the wastes, the untrodden paths
                  of the world; I tracked Columbus across the pathless Atlantic,—heard, with Balboa,
                  the "wave of the loud-roaring ocean break upon the long shore, and the vast sea of
                  the Pacific forever crash on the beach,"—gazed with Cortés on the temples of the
                  Sun in the startling Mexican empire, or wandered with Pizarro through the
                  silver-lined palaces of Peru. But a secret affection drew me to the mysterious
                  regions of the East and South,—towards Arabia, the wild Ishmael bequeathing
                  sworded Korans and subtile Aristotles as legacies to the sons of the
                  freed-woman,—to solemn Egypt, riddle of nations, the vast, silent, impenetrable
                  mystery of the world. By continual pondering over the footsteps of the Seekers,
                  the Sought-for seemed to grow to vast proportions, and the Found to shrink to
                  inappreciable littleness. For me, over the dreary ice-plains of the Poles, over
                  the profound bosom of Africa, the far-stretching steppes of Asia, and the rocky
                  wilds of America, a great silence brooded, and in the unexplored void faint
                  footfalls could be heard here and there, threading their way in the darkness. But
                  while the longing to plunge, myself, into these dim regions of expectation grew
                  more intense each day, the prison-chains that had always bound me still kept their
                  habitual hold upon me, even after my recovery. I dreamt not of making even the
                  vaguest plans for undertaking explorations myself. So I read and dreamt, filling
                  my room with wild African or monotonous Egyptian scenery, until I was almost
                  weaned from ordinary Occidental life.</p>
               <p>I passed four blissful years in this happy dream-life, and<pb n="10-11"
                     xml:id="VAC7187-00000006"/> then it was abruptly brought to an end by the death
                  of my father and mother almost simultaneously by an epidemic fever prevailing in
                  the neighborhood. I was away from home at a bachelor uncle's at the time, and so
                  was unexpectedly thrown on his hands, an orphan, penniless, except in the
                  possession of the small house my father had owned in the country before our
                  removal to the city, and to be provided for. My uncle placed me in a mercantile
                  house to learn business, and, after exercising some slight supervision over me a
                  few months, left me entirely to my own resources. As, however, he had previously
                  taken care that these resources should be sufficient, I got along very well upon
                  them, was regularly promoted, and in the space of six years, at the age of
                  twenty-one, was in a rather responsible situation in the house, with a good
                  salary. But my whole attention could not be absorbed in the dull routine of
                  business; my most precious hours were devoted to reading, in which I still pursued
                  my old childish track of speculation, with the difference that I exchanged
                  Sindbad's valley of diamonds for Arabia Petræa, Sir John Mandeville for Herodotus,
                  and Robinson Crusoe for Belzoni and Burckhardt. Whether my interest in these
                  Oriental studies arose from the fact of the house being concerned in the
                  importation of the products of the Indies, or whether from the secret attraction
                  that had drawn me Eastward since my earliest childhood, as if the Arab doctor had
                  bewitched in curing me, I cannot say; probably it was the former, especially as
                  the India business became gradually more and more intrusted to my hands.</p>
               <p>Shortly after my twenty-first birthday, I received a note from my uncle, from whom
                  I had not heard for a year or two, informing me that my father's house, which he
                  had kept rented for me during the first years of my minority, had been without a
                  tenant for a year; and as I had now come of age, I had better go down to D—— and
                  take possession of it. This letter, touching upon a long train of associations and
                  recollections, awoke an intense longing in me to revisit the home of my childhood,
                  and meet those phantom shapes that had woven that spell in those dreaming years,
                  which I sometimes thought I felt even now. So I obtained a short leave of absence,
                  and started the next morning in the coach for D——.</p>
               <p>It was what is called a "raw morning," for what reason I know not, for such days
                  are really elaborated with the most exquisite finish. A soft gray mist hugged the
                  country in a chilly embrace, while a fine rain fell as noiselessly as snow, upon
                  soaked ground, drenched trees, and peevish houses. There is always a sense of
                  wonder about a mist. The outlines of what we consider our hardest tangibilities
                  are melted away by it into the airiest dream-sketches, our most positive and
                  glaring facts are blankly blotted out, and a fresh, clean sheet left for some new
                  fantasy to be written upon it, as groundless as the rest; our solid land dissolves
                  in cloud, and cloud assumes the stability of land. For, after all, the only really
                  tangible thing we possess is man's Will; and let the presence and action of that
                  be withdrawn but for a few moments, and that mysterious Something which we vainly
                  endeavor to push off into the Void by our pompous nothings of brick and plaster
                  and stone, closes down upon us with the descending sky, writing <foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">Delendum</foreign> on all behind us, <emph>Unknown</emph> on all
                  before. At that time the only actual Now, that stands between these two infinite
                  blanks, becomes identical with the mind itself, independent of accidents of
                  situation or circumstance; and the mind thus becoming boldly prominent, amidst the
                  fading away of physical things, stamps its own character upon its shadowy
                  surroundings, moulding the supple universe to the shape of its emotions and
                  feelings.</p>
               <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7187-00000007"/>
               <p>I was the only inside passenger, and there was nothing to check the entire
                  surrender of my mind to all ghostly influence. So I lay stretched upon the
                  cushions, staring blankly into the dense gray fog closing up all trace of our
                  travelled road, or watching the light edges of the trailing mist curl coyly around
                  the roofs of houses and then settle grimly all over them; the fantastic shapes of
                  trees or carts distorted and magnified through the mist; the lofty outlines of
                  some darker cloud stalking solemnly here and there, like enormous dumb overseers
                  faithfully superintending the work of annihilation. The monotonous patter of the
                  rain-drops upon the wet pavement or muddy roads, blending with the low whining of
                  the wind and the steady rumble of the coach-wheels, seemed to make a kind of
                  witch-chant, that wove with braided sound a weird spell about me, a charm fating
                  me for some service, I knew not what. That chant moaned, it wailed, it whispered,
                  it sang gloriously, it bound, it drowned me, it lapped me in an inextricable
                  stream of misty murmuring, till I was perplexed, bewildered, enchanted. I felt
                  surprised at myself, when, at the end of the day's journey, I carried my bag to
                  the hotel, and ate my supper there as usual, and felt natural again only when,
                  having obtained the key of my house, I sallied forth in the dim twilight to make
                  it my promised visit.</p>
               <p>I found the place, as I had expected, in a state of utter desolation. A year's
                  silence had removed it so far from the noisy stream of life that flowed by it,
                  that I felt, as I pushed at the rusty door-lock, as if I were passing into some
                  old garret of Time, where he had thrown forgotten rubbish too worn-out and
                  antiquated for present use. A strong scent of musk greeted me at my entrance,
                  which I found came from a box of it that had been broken upon the hall floor. I
                  had stowed it away (it was a favorite perfume fume with me, because it was so
                  associated with my Arabian Nights' stories) upon a ledge over the door, where it
                  had rested undisturbed while the house was tenanted, and had been now probably
                  dislodged by rats. But I half fancied that this odor which impregnated the air of
                  the whole house was the essence of that atmosphere in which, as a child, I had
                  communicated with Burckhardt and Belzoni—and that, expelled by the solid,
                  practical, Occidental atmosphere of the last few years, it had flowed back again,
                  in these last silent months, in anticipation of my return.</p>
               <p>Like a prudent householder, I made the tour of the house with a light I had
                  provided myself with, and mentally made memoranda of repairs, alterations, etc.,
                  for rendering it habitable. My last visit was to be to the garret, where many of
                  my books yet remained. As I passed once more through the parlor, on my way
                  thither, a ray of light from my raised lamp fell upon the wall that I had thought
                  blank, and a majestic face started suddenly from the darkness. So sudden was the
                  apparition, that for the moment I was startled, till I remembered that there had
                  formerly been a picture in that place, and I stopped to examine it. It was a head
                  of the Sphinx. The calm, grand face was partially averted, so that the sorrowful
                  eyes, almost betraying the aching secret which the still lips kept sacred, were
                  hidden,—only the slight, tender droop in the corner of the mouth told what their
                  expression might be. Around, forever stretched the endless sands—the mystery of
                  life found in the heart of death. That mournful, eternal face gave me a strange
                  feeling of weariness and helplessness. I felt as if I had already pressed eagerly
                  to the other side of the head, still only to find the voiceless lips and mute
                  eyes. Strange tears sprang to my eyes; I hastily brushed them away, and, leaving
                  the Sphinx, mounted to my garret.</p>
               <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7187-00000008"/>
               <p>But the riddle followed me. I sat down on the floor, beside a box of books, and
                  somewhat listlessly began pulling it over to examine the contents. The first book
                  I took hold of was a little worn volume of Herodotus that had belonged to my
                  father. I opened it; and as if it, too, were a link in the chain of influences
                  which I half felt was being forged around me, it opened at the first part of
                  "Euterpe," where Herodotus is speculating upon the phenomena of the Nile.
                  Twenty-two hundred years,—I thought,—and we are still wondering; the Sphinx is
                  still silent, and we yet in the darkness! Alas, if this riddle be insoluble, how
                  can we hope to find the clue to deeper problems? If there are places on our little
                  earth whither our feet cannot go, curtains that our hands cannot withdraw, how can
                  we expect to track paths through realms of thought,—how to voyage in those airy,
                  impalpable regions whose existence we are sure of only while we are there
                  voyaging? <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Nilus in extremum fugit perterritus orbem</l>
                        <l>Occuluitque caput, quod adhuc latet."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> Lost through reckless presumption, might not earnest humility recover that
                  mysterious lurking-place? Might not one, by devoted toil, by utter self-sacrifice,
                  with eyes purified by long searching from worldly and selfish pollution,—might not
                  such a one tear away the veil of centuries, and, even though dying in the attempt,
                  gain one look into this arcanum? Might not I?—The unutterable thought thrilled me
                  and left me speechless, even in thinking. I strained my forehead against the
                  darkness, as if I could grind the secret from the void air. Then I experienced the
                  following mental sensation,—which, being purely mental, I cannot describe
                  precisely as it was, but will translate it as nearly as possible into the language
                  of physical phenomena.</p>
               <p>It was as if my mind—or, rather, whatever that passive substratum is that
                  underlies our volition and more truly represents ourselves—were a still lake,
                  lying quiet and indifferent. Presently the sense of some coming Presence sent a
                  breathing ripple over its waters; and immediately afterwards it felt a sweep as of
                  trailing garments, and two arms were thrown around it, and it was pressed against
                  a "life-giving bosom," whose vivifying warmth interpenetrating the whole body of
                  the lake, its waters rose, moved by a mighty influence, in the direction of that
                  retreating Presence; and again, though nothing was seen, I felt surely whither was
                  that direction. It was NILEWARD. I knew, with the absolute certainty of intuition,
                  that henceforth I was one of the <foreign xml:lang="GRC">kletoi</foreign> the
                  chosen,—selected from thousands of ages, millions of people, for this one destiny.
                  Henceforth a sharp dividing-line cut me off from all others: <emph>their</emph>
                  appointment was to trade, navigate, eat and drink, marry and give in marriage, and
                  the rest; mine was to discover the Source of the Nile. Hither had all the threads
                  of my life been converging for many years; they had now reached their focus, and
                  henceforth their course was fixed.</p>
               <p>I was scarcely surprised the next day at receiving a letter from my employers
                  appointing me to a situation as supercargo of a merchant-vessel bound on a three
                  years' voyage to America and China,—in returning thence, to sail up the
                  Mediterranean, and stop at Alexandria. I immediately wrote an acceptance, and then
                  busied myself about obtaining a three years' tenant for my house. As the house was
                  desirable and well-situated, this business was soon arranged; and then, as I had
                  nothing further to do in the village, I left it for the last time, as it
                     proved,<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7187-00000009"/> and returned to the
                  city,—whence, after a fortnight of preparation, I set sail on my eventful
                  enterprise. Although our voyage was filled with incident that in another place
                  would be interesting enough to relate, yet here I must omit all mention of it,
                  and, passing over three years, resume my narrative at Alexandria, where I left the
                  vessel, and finally broke away from mercantile life.</p>
               <p>From Alexandria I travelled to Cairo, where I intended to hire a servant and a
                  boat, for I wished to try the water-passage in preference to the land. The
                  cheapness of labor and food rendered it no difficult matter to obtain my boat, and
                  provision it for a long voyage,—for how long I did not tell the Egyptian servant
                  whom I hired to attend me. A certain feeling of fatality caused me to make no
                  attempt at disguise, although disguise was then much more necessary than it has
                  been since: I openly avowed my purpose of travelling on the Nile for pleasure, as
                  a private European, My accoutrements were simple and few. Arms, of course, I
                  carried, and the actual necessaries for subsistence; but I entirely forgot to
                  prepare for sketching, scientific surveys, etc. My whole mind was possessed with
                  one idea; to see, to discover;—plans for turning my discoveries to account were
                  totally foreign to my thoughts.</p>
               <p>So, on the sixth of November, 1824, we set sail. I had been waiting three years to
                  arrive at this starting-point,—my whole life, indeed, had been dumbly turning
                  towards it,—yet now I commenced it with a coolness and tranquillity far exceeding
                  that I had possessed on many comparatively trifling occasions. It is often so. We
                  are borne along on the current like drift-wood, and, spying jutting rocks or
                  tremendous cataracts ahead, fancy, "Here we shall be stranded, there buoyed up,
                  there dashed in pieces over those falls,"—but, for all that, we glide over those
                  threatened catastrophes in a very commonplace manner, and are aware of what we
                  have been passing only upon looking back at them. So no one sees the great light
                  shining from Heaven,—for the people are blear-eyed, and Saul is blinded. But as I
                  left Cairo in the greatening distance, floating onward to the heart of the
                  mysterious river, I floated also into the twin current of thought, that, flowing
                  full and impetuous from the shores of the peopled Mediterranean, follows the
                  silent river, and tracks it to its hidden lurking-place in the blank desert.
                  Onward, past the breathless sands of the Libyan Desert, past the hundred-gated
                  Thebes, past the stone guardians of Abou-Simbel, waiting in majestic patience for
                  their spell of silence to be broken,—onward. It struck me curiously to come to the
                  cataract, and be obliged to leave my boat at the foot of the first fall, and hire
                  another above the second,—a forcible reminder that I was travelling backwards,
                  from the circumference to the centre from which that circumference had been
                  produced, faintly feeling my way along a tide of phenomena to the <foreign
                     xml:lang="GRC">noumenon</foreign> supporting them. So we always progress: from
                  arithmetic to geometry, from observation to silence, from practice to theory, and
                  play with edged tools long before we know what knives mean. For, like
                  Hop-o'-my-Thumb and his brothers, we are driven out early in the morning to the
                  edge of the forest, and are obliged to grope our way back, to the little house
                  whence we come, by the crumbs dropped on the road. Alack! how often the birds have
                  eaten our bread, and we are captured by the giant lying in wait!</p>
               <p>On we swept, leaving behind the burning rocks and dreary sands of Egypt and Lower
                  Nubia, the green woods and thick acacias of Dongola, the distant pyramids of Mount
                  Birkel, and the ruins of Meroë, just discovered footmarks of Ancient Ethiopia
                  descending the Nile to<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7187-00000010"/> bequeathe her
                  glory and civilization to Egypt. At Old Dongola, my companion was very anxious
                  that we should strike across the country to Shendy, to avoid the great curve of
                  the Nile through Ethiopia. He found the sail somewhat tedious, as I could speak
                  but little Egyptian, which I had picked up in scraps—he, no German or English. I
                  managed to overrule his objections, however, as I could not bear to leave any part
                  of the river unvisited; so we continued the water-route to the junction of the
                  Blue and the White Nile, where I resolved to remain a week, before continuing my
                  route. The inhabitants regarded us with some suspicion, but our inoffensive
                  appearance so far conquered their fears that they were prevailed upon to give us
                  some information about the country, and to furnish us with a fresh supply of rice,
                  wheat, and dourra, in exchange for beads and bright-colored cloths, which I had
                  brought with me for the purpose of such traffic, if it should be necessary.
                  Bruce's discovery of the source of the Blue Nile, fifty, years before, prevented
                  the necessity of indecision in regard to my route; and so completely was I
                  absorbed in the one object of my journey, that the magnificent scenery and ruins
                  along the Blue Nile, which had so fascinated Cailliaud, presented few allurements
                  for me.</p>
               <p>My stay was rather longer than I had anticipated, as it was found necessary to
                  make some repairs upon the boat; and, inwardly fretting at each hour's delay, I
                  was eager to seize the first opportunity for starting again. On the 1st of March I
                  made a fresh beginning for the more unknown and probably more perilous portion of
                  my voyage, having been about four months in ascending from Cairo. As my voyage had
                  commenced about the abatement of the sickly season, I had experienced no
                  inconvenience from the climate, and it was in good spirits that I resumed my
                  journey. For several days we sailed with little eventful occurring,—floating on
                  under the cloudless sky, rippling a long white line through the widening surface
                  of the ever-flowing river, through floating beds of glistening lotus-flowers, past
                  undulating ramparts of foliage and winged ambak-blossoms guarding the shores,
                  scaled by adventurous vines that triumphantly waved their banners of white, and
                  purple, and yellow from the summit, winding amid bowery islands studding the broad
                  stream like gems, smoothly stemming the rolling flood of the river, flowing, ever
                  flowing,—lurking in the cool shade of the dense mimosa forests, gliding
                  noiselessly past the trodden lairs of hippopotami and lions, slushing through the
                  reeds swaying to and fro in the green water, still borne along against the silent
                  current of the mysterious river, flowing, ever flowing.</p>
               <p>We had now arrived at the land of the Dinkas, where the river, by broadening too
                  much upon a low country, had become partially devoured by marsh and reeds, and our
                  progress was very slow, tediously dragging over a sea of water and grass. I had
                  become a little tired of my complete loneliness, and was almost longing for some
                  collision with the tribes of savages that throng the shore, when the incident
                  occurred that determined my whole future life. One morning, about seven o'clock,
                  when the hot sun had already begun to rob the day of the delicious freshness
                  lingering around a tropical night, we happened to be passing a tract of firmer
                  land than we had met with for some time, and I directed the vessel towards the
                  shore, to gather some of the brilliant lotus-flowers that fringed the banks. As we
                  neared the land, I threw my gun, without which I never left the boat, on the bank,
                  preparatory to leaping out, when I was startled by hearing a loud, cheery voice
                  exclaim in English: "Hilloa! not so fast, if you please!"—and first the head and
                  then the sturdy<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7187-00000011"/> shoulders of a white man
                  raised themselves slowly from the low shrubbery by which they were surrounded. He
                  looked at us for a minute or two, and nodded with a contented air that perplexed
                  me exceedingly.</p>
               <p>"So," he said, "you have come at last; I am tired of waiting for you;" and he
                  began to collect his gun, knife, etc., which were lying on the ground beside
                  him.</p>
               <p>"And who are you," I returned, "who lie in wait for me? I think, sir, you have the
                  advantage."</p>
               <p>Here the stranger interrupted me with a hearty laugh.</p>
               <p>"My dear fellow," he cried, "you are entirely mistaken. The technical advantage
                  that you attribute to me is an error, as I do <emph>not</emph> have the honor of
                  knowing your name, though you may know mine without further preface—Frederick
                  Herndon; and the real advantage which I wish to avail myself of, a boat, is
                  obviously on your side. The long and the short of it is," he added (composedly
                  extracting himself from the brushwood), "that, travelling up in this direction for
                  discovery and that sort of thing, you know, I heard at Sennaar that a white man
                  with an Egyptian servant had just left the town, and was going in my direction in
                  a boat. So I resolved to overtake them, and with their, or your, permission, join
                  company. But they, or you, kept just in advance, and it was only by dint of a
                  forced march in the night that I passed you. I learned at the last Dinka village
                  that no such party had been yet seen, and concluded to await your arrival here,
                  where I pitched my tent a day and a night waiting for you. I am heartily glad to
                  see you, I assure you."</p>
               <p>With this explanation, the stranger made a spring, and leaped upon the yacht.</p>
               <p>"Upon my word," said I, still bewildered by his sudden appearance, "you are very
                  unceremonious."</p>
               <p>"That," he rejoined, "is a way we Americans have. We cannot stop to palaver. What
                  would become of our manifest destiny? But since you are so kind, I will call my
                  Egyptian. Times are changed since we were bondsmen in Egypt, have they not? Ah, I
                  forgot, you are not an American, and therefore cannot claim even our remote
                  connection with the Ten Lost Tribes." Then raising his voice, "Here, Ibrahim!"</p>
               <p>Again a face, but this time a swarthy one, emerged from behind a bush, and in
                  answer to a few directions in his own dialect the man came down to the boat, threw
                  in the tent and some other articles of traveller's furniture, and sprang in with
                  the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">nonchalance</foreign> of his master.</p>
               <p>A little recovered from my first surprise, I seized the opportunity of a little
                  delay in getting the boat adrift again to examine my new companion. He was
                  standing carelessly upon the little deck of the vessel where he had first entered,
                  and the strong morning light fell full upon his well-knit figure, and apparently
                  handsome face. The forehead was rather low, prominent above the eyebrows, and with
                  keen, hollow temples, but deficient both in comprehensiveness and ideality. The
                  hazel eyes were brilliant, but restless and shallow,—the mouth of good size, but
                  with few curves, and perhaps a little too close for so young a face. The well-cut
                  nose and chin, and clean fine outline of face, the self-reliant pose of the neck,
                  and confident set of the shoulders, characterized him as decisive and energetic,
                  while the pleasant and rather boyish smile that lighted up his face dispelled
                  presently the peculiarly hard expression I had at first found in analyzing it.
                  Whether it was the hard, shrewd light from which all the tender and delicate grace
                  of the early morning had departed, I knew not; but it struck me that I could not
                  find a particle of shade, in his whole appearance. I seemed at once to take him
                  in, as one sees the whole of a sunny country<pb n="22-23"
                     xml:id="VAC7187-00000012"/> where there are no woods, or mountains, or valleys.
                  And in fact, I never did find any,—never any cool recesses in his character; and
                  as no sudden depths ever opened in his eyes, so nothing was ever left to be
                  revealed in his character;—like them, it could be sounded at once. That picture of
                  him, standing there on my deck, with an indefinite expression of belonging to the
                  place, as he would have belonged on his own hearth-rug at home, often recurred to
                  me, again to be renewed and confirmed.</p>
               <p>And thus carelessly was swept into my path, as a stray waif, that man who would in
                  one little moment change my whole life! It is always so. Our life sweeps onward
                  like a river, brushing in here a little sand, there a few rushes, till the
                  accumulated drift-wood chokes the current, or some larger tree falling across it
                  turns it into a new channel.</p>
               <p>I had been so long unaccustomed to company that I found it quite a pleasant change
                  to have some one to talk to; some one to sympathize with I neither wanted nor
                  expected; I certainly did not find such a one in my new acquaintance. For the
                  first two or three days I simply regarded him with the sort of wondering curiosity
                  with which we examine a new natural phenomenon of any sort. His perfect
                  self-possession and coolness, the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">nil-admiran</foreign>
                  and <foreign xml:lang="LAT">nil-agitari</foreign> atmosphere which surrounded him,
                  excited my admiration at first, till I discovered that it arose, not from the
                  composure of a mind too deep-rooted to be swayed by external circumstances, but
                  rather from a peculiar hardness and unimpressibility of temperament that kept him
                  on the same level all the time. He had been born at a certain temperature, and
                  still preserved it, from a sort of <foreign xml:lang="LAT">vis inertiæ</foreign>
                  of constitution. This impenetrability had the effect of a somewhat buoyant
                  disposition, not because he could be buoyed on the tide of any strong emotion, but
                  because few things could disturb or excite him. Unable to grasp the significance
                  of anything outside of himself and his attributes, he took immense pride in
                  stamping <emph>his</emph> character, <emph>his</emph> nationality,
                     <emph>his</emph> practicality, upon every series of circumstances by which he
                  was surrounded: he sailed up the Nile as if it were the Mississippi; although a
                  well-enough-informed man, he practically ignored the importance of any city
                  anterior to the Plymouth Settlement, or at least to London, which had the honor of
                  sending colonists to New England; and he would have discussed American politics in
                  the heart of Africa, had not my ignorance upon the topic generally excluded it
                  from our conversation. He had what is most wrongly termed an exceedingly practical
                  mind,—that is, not one that appreciates the practical existence and value of
                  thought as such, considering that a <foreign xml:lang="GRC">praxis,</foreign> but
                  a mind that denied the existence of a thought until it had become realized in
                  visible action.</p>
               <p>"'The end of a man is an action, and not a thought, though it be the noblest,' as
                  Carlyle has well written," he triumphantly quoted to me, as, leaning over the
                  little railing of the yacht, watching, at least I was, the smooth, green water
                  gliding under the clean-cutting keel, we had been talking earnestly for some time.
                  "A thought has value only as it is a potential action; if the action be abortive,
                  the thought is as useless as a crank that fails to move an engine-wheel."</p>
               <p>"Then, if action is the wheel, and thought only the crank, what does the body of
                  your engine represent? For what purpose are your wheels turning? For the sake of
                  merely moving?"</p>
               <p>"No," said he, "moving to promote another action, and <emph>that</emph>
                  another,—and——so on <foreign xml:lang="LAT">ad infinitum</foreign>"</p>
               <p>"Then you leave out of your scheme a real engine,<pb n="24-25"
                     xml:id="VAC7187-00000013"/> with a journey to accomplish, and an end to arrive
                  at; for so wheels would only move wheels, and there would be an endless chain of
                  machinery, with no plan, no object for its existence. Does not the very necessity
                  we feel of having a reason for the existence, the operation of anything, a large
                  plan in which to gather up all ravelled threads of various objects, proclaim
                  thought as the final end, the real thing, of which action, more especially human
                  action, is but the inadequate visible expression? What kinds of action does
                  Carlyle mean, that are to be the wheels for our obedient thoughts to set in
                  motion? Hand, arm, leg, foot action? These are all our operative machinery. Does
                  he mean that our 'noblest thought' is to be chained as a galley-slave to these, to
                  give them means for working a channel through which motive power may be poured in
                  upon them? Are we to think that our fingers and feet may move and so we live, or
                  they to run for our thought, and we live to think?"</p>
               <p>"Supposing we <emph>are,</emph>" said Herndon, "what practical good results from
                  knowing it? Action for action's sake, or for thinking's sake, is still action, and
                  all that we have to look out for. What business have the brakemen at the wheels
                  with the destiny of the train? Their business is simply to lock and unlock the
                  wheels; so that their end is in the wheels, and not in the train."</p>
               <p>"A somewhat dreary end," I said, half to myself. "The whole world, then, must
                  content itself with spinning one blind action out of another; which means that we
                  must continually alter or displace something, merely to be able to displace and
                  alter something else."</p>
               <p>"On the contrary, we exchange vague speculative mystifications for definite
                  tangible fact. In America we have too much reality, too many iron and steam facts,
                  to waste much time over mere thinking. That, sir, does for a sleepy old country,
                  begging your pardon like yours; but for one that has the world's destiny in its
                  hands,—that is laying iron foot-paths from the Atlantic to the Pacific for future
                  civilization to take an evening stroll along to see the sun set,—that is
                  converting black wool into white cotton, to clothe the inhabitants of
                  Borrioboolagha,—that is trading, farming, electing, governing, fighting, annexing,
                  destroying, building, puffing, blowing, steaming, racing, as our young
                  two-hundred-year-old is,—we must work, we must act, and think afterwards.
                  Whatsoever thy <emph>hand</emph> findeth to do, do it with thy might."</p>
               <p>"And what," I said, "when hand-and-foot-action shall have ceased? Will you then
                  allow some play for thought-action?"</p>
               <p>"We have no time to think of that," he returned, walking away, and thus stopping
                  our conversation.</p>
               <p>The man was consistent in his theory at least. Having exalted physical motion (or
                  action) to the place he did, he refused to see that the action he prized was more
                  valuable through the thought it developed; consequently he reduced all actions to
                  the same level, and prided himself upon stripping a deed of all its marvellousness
                  or majesty. He did uncommon things in such a matter-of-fact way that he made them
                  common by the performance. The faint spiritual double which I found lurking behind
                  his steel and iron he either solidified with his metallic touch or pertinaciously
                  denied its existence.</p>
               <p>"Plato was a fool," he said, "to talk of an ideal table; for, supposing he could
                  see it, and prove its existence, what good could it do? You can neither eat off
                  it, nor iron on it, nor do anything else with it; so, for all practical purposes,
                  a pine table serves perfectly well without hunting after the ideal. I want
                  something that I can go up to, and know it is there by seeing and touching."</p>
               <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7187-00000014"/>
               <p>"But," said I, "does not that very susceptibility to bodily contact remove the
                  table to an indefinite distance from you? If we can see and handle a thing, and
                  yet not be able to hold that subtile property of generic existence, by which, one
                  table being made, an infinite class is created, so real that tables may actually
                  be modelled on it, and yet so indefinite that you cannot set your hand on any
                  table or collection of tables, and say, 'It is here,'—if we can be absolutely
                  conscious that we see the table, and yet have no idea how its image reflected on
                  our retina can produce that absolute consciousness, does not the table grow dim
                  and misty, and slip far away out of reach, of apprehension, much more of
                  comprehension?"</p>
               <p>"Stuff!" cried my companion. "If your metaphysics lead to proving that a board
                  that I am touching with my hand is not there, I'll say, as I have already said,
                  'Throw (meta) physics to the dogs! I'll none of it!' A fine preparation for living
                  in a material word, where we have to live in matter, by matter, and for matter, to
                  wind one's self up in a snarl that puts matter out of reach, and leaves us nothing
                  to live in, or by, or for! Now <emph>you,</emph> for instance, are not content
                  with this poor old Nile as it stands, but must go fussing and wondering and
                  mystifying about it till you have positively nothing of a river left. I look at
                  the water, the banks, the trees growing on them, the islands in which we get
                  occasionally entangled; here, at least, I have a real, substantial river—not equal
                  for navigation to the Ohio or Mississippi, but still very fair. Confound these
                  flies!" he added, parenthetically, making a vigorous plunge at a dark cloud of the
                  little pests that were closing down upon us.</p>
               <p>"Then you see nothing strange and solemn in this wonderful stream? nothing in the
                  weird civilization crouching at the feet, vainly looking to the head of its master
                  hidden in the clouds? nothing in the echoing footsteps of nations passing down its
                  banks to their destiny? nothing in the solemn, unbroken silence brooding over the
                  fountain whence sprang this marvellous river, to bear precious gifts to thousands
                  and millions, and again retreat unknown? Is there no mystery in unsolved
                  questions, no wonder in miracles, no awe in inapproachability?"</p>
               <p>"I see," said he, steadily, "that a river of some thousand miles long has run
                  through a country peopled by contented, or ignorant, or barbarous people, none of
                  whom, of course, would take the slightest interest in tracing the river; that the
                  dangers that have guarded the marvellous secret, as you call it, are not intrinsic
                  to the secret itself, but are purely accidental and contingent. There is no more
                  reason why the source of the Nile should not be found than that of the
                  Connecticut; so I do not see that it is really at all inapproachable or
                  awful."</p>
               <p>"What in the world, Herndon," cried I, in desperation, "what in the name of common
                  sense ever induced you to set out on this expedition? What do you want to discover
                  the source of the Nile for?"</p>
               <p>He answered with the ready air of one who has long ago made up his mind
                  confidently on the subject he is going to speak about.</p>
               <p>"It has long been evident to me, that civilization, flowing in a return current
                  from America, must penetrate into Africa, and turn its immense natural advantages
                  to such account that it shall become the seat of the most flourishing and
                  important empires of the earth. These, however, should be consolidated, and not
                  split up into multitudinous missionary stations. If a stream of immigration could
                  be started from the eastern side, up the Nile for instance, penetrating to the
                  interior, it might meet the increased tide of a kindred nature from the west,
                     and<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7187-00000015"/> uniting somewhere in the middle of
                  Soudan, the centra point of action, the capital city could be founded there, as a
                  heart for the country, and a complete system of circulation be established. By
                  this method of entering the country at both sides simultaneously, of course its
                  complete subjugation could be accomplished in half the time that it would take for
                  a body of emigrants, however large, to make headway from the western coast alone.
                  About the source of the Nile I intend to mark out the site for my city, and
                  then——"</p>
               <p>"And call it," I added, "Herndonville."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps," he said, gravely. "At all events, my name will be inseparably connected
                  with the enterprise; and if I can get the steamboat started during my lifetime, I
                  shall make a comfortable fortune from the speculation."</p>
               <p>"What a gigantic scheme!" I exclaimed.</p>
               <p>"Ah," he said, complacently, "we Americans don't stick at trifles."</p>
               <p>"Oh, marvellous practical genius of America!" I cried? "to eclipse Herodotus and
                  Diodorus, not to mention Bruce and Cailliaud, and inscribe Herndonville on the
                  arcanum of the Innermost! If the Americans should discover the origin of evil,
                  they would run up penitentiaries all over the country, modelled to suit 'practical
                  purposes.'"</p>
               <p>"I think that would pay," said Herndon, reflectively.</p>
               <p>But though I then stopped the conversation, yet I felt its influence afterwards.
                  The divine enthusiasm for <emph>knowing,</emph> that had inspired me for the last
                  three years, and had left no room for any other thought in connection with the
                  discovery—this enthusiasm felt chilled and deadened. I felt reproached that I had
                  not thought of founding a Pottsville or Jenkinsville, and my grand purpose seemed
                  small and vague and indefinite. The vivid, living thoughts that had enkindled me
                  fell back cold and lifeless into the tedious, reedy water. For we had now reached
                  the immense shallow lake that Werne has since described, and the scenery had
                  become flat and monotonous, as if in sympathy with the low, marshy place to which
                  my mind had been driven. The intricate windings of the river, after we had passed
                  the lake, rendered the navigation very slow and difficult; and the swarms of flies
                  that plagued us for the first time seriously, brought petty annoyances to view
                  more forcibly than we had experienced in all our voyage before.</p>
               <p>After some days' pushing in this way, now driven by a strong head wind almost back
                  from our course, again, by a sudden change, carried rapidly many miles on our
                  journey—after some days of this sailing, we arrived at a long, low reef of rocks.
                  The water here became so shallow and boisterous that further attempt at sailing
                  was impossible, and we determined to take our boat to pieces as much as we could,
                  and carry it with us, while we walked along the shore of the river. I concluded,
                  from the marked depression in the ground we had just passed, that there must be a
                  corresponding elevation about here, to give the water a sufficient head to pass
                  over the high ground below; and the almost cataract appearance of the river added
                  strength to my hypothesis. We were all four armed to the teeth, and the natives
                  had shown themselves, hitherto, either so friendly or so indifferent that we did
                  not have much apprehension on account of personal safety. So we set out with
                  beating hearts. Our path was exceedingly difficult to traverse, leading chiefly
                  among low trees and over the sharp stones that had rolled from the river,—now
                  close by the noisy stream, which babbled and foamed as if it had gone mad,—now
                  creeping on our knees through bushes, matted with thick, twining vines,—now wading
                  across an open morass,—now in mimosa<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7187-00000016"/>
                  woods, or slipping in and out of the feathery dhelb-palms.</p>
               <p>Since our conversation spoken of above, Herndon and I had talked little with each
                  other, and now usually spoke merely of the incidents of the journey, the
                  obstacles, etc.; we scarcely mentioned that for which we were both longing with
                  intense desire, and the very thoughts of which made my heart beat quicker and the
                  blood rush to my face. One day we came to a place where the river made a bend of
                  about two miles and then passed almost parallel to our point of view. I proposed
                  to Herndon that he should pursue the course of the river, and that I would strike
                  a little way back into the country, and make a short cut across to the other side
                  of the bend, where he and the men would stop, pitch our night-tent, and wait for
                  me. Herndon assented, and we parted. The low fields around us changed, as I went
                  on, to firm, hard, rising ground, that gradually became sandy and arid. The
                  luxuriant vegetation that clung around the banks of the river seemed to be dried
                  up little by little, until only a few dusty bushes and thorn-acacias studded in
                  clumps a great, sandy, and rocky tract of country, which rolled monotonously back
                  from the river border with a steadily increasing elevation. A sandy plain never
                  gives me a sense of real substance; it always seems as if it must be merely a
                  covering for something,—a sheet thrown over a bed where a dead man is lying. And
                  especially here did this broad, trackless, seemingly boundless desert face me with
                  its blank negation, like the old obstinate "No" which Nature always returns at
                  first to your eager questioning. It provoked me, this staring reticence of the
                  scenery, and stimulated me to a sort of dogged exertion. I think I walked steadily
                  for about three hours over the jagged rocks and burning sands, interspersed with a
                  few patches of straggling grass,—all the time up hill, with never a valley to vary
                  the monotonous climbing,—until the bushes began to thicken in about the same
                  manner as they had thinned into the desert, the grass and herbage herded closer
                  together under my feet, and, beating off the ravenous sand, gradually expelled the
                  last trace of it, a few tall trees strayed timidly among the lower shrubbery,
                  growing more and more thickly, till I found myself at the border of an apparently
                  extensive forest. The contrast was great between the view before and behind me.
                  Behind lay the road I had achieved, the monotonous, toilsome, wearisome desert,
                  the dry, formal introduction, as it were, to my coming journey. Before, long, cool
                  vistas opened green through delicious shades,—a track seemed to be almost made
                  over the soft grass, that wound in and out among the trees, and lost itself in
                  interminable mazes. I plunged into the profound depths of the still forest, and
                  confidently followed for path the first open space in which I found myself.</p>
               <p>It was a strangely still wood for the tropics,—no chattering parroquets, no
                  screaming magpies, none of the sneering, gibing dissonances that I had been
                  accustomed to,—all was silent, and yet intensely living. I fancied that the noble
                  trees took pleasure in growing, they were so energized with life in every leaf. I
                  noticed another peculiarity,—there was little underbrush, little of the luxuriance
                  of vines and creepers, which is so striking in an African forest. Parasitic life,
                  luxurious idleness, seemed impossible here; the atmosphere was too sacred, too
                  solemn, for the fantastic ribaldry of scarlet runners, of flaunting yellow
                  streamers. The lofty boughs interlaced in arches overhead, and the vast dim aisles
                  opened far down in the tender gloom of the wood and faded slowly away in the
                  distance. And every little spray of leaves<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7187-00000017"
                  /> that tossed airily in the pleasant breeze, every slender branch swaying gently
                  in the wind, every young sapling pushing its childish head panting for light
                  through the mass of greenery and quivering with golden sunbeams, every trunk of
                  aged tree gray with moss and lichens, every tuft of flowers, seemed thrilled and
                  vivified by some wonderful knowledge which it held secret, some consciousness of
                  boundless, inexhaustible existence, some music of infinite unexplored thought
                  concealing treasures of unlimited action. And it was the knowledge, the
                  consciousness, that it was unlimited which seemed to give such elastic energy to
                  this strange forest. But at all events, it was such a relief to find the
                  everlasting negation of the desert nullified, that my dogged resolution insensibly
                  changed to an irrepressible enthusiasm, which bore me lightly along, scarcely
                  sensible of fatigue.</p>
               <p>The ascent had become so much steeper, and parts of the forest seemed to slope off
                  into such sudden declivities and even precipices, that I concluded I was ascending
                  a mountain; and, from the length of time I had been in the forest, I judged that
                  it must be of considerable height. The wood suddenly broke off as it had begun,
                  and, emerging from the cool shade, I found myself in a complete wilderness of
                  rock. Rocks of enormous size were thrown about in apparently the wildest
                  confusion, on the side of what I now perceived to be a high mountain. How near the
                  summit I was I had no means of determining, as huge boulders blocked up the view
                  at a few paces ahead. I had had about eight hours' tramp, with scarcely any
                  cessation; yet now my excitement was too great to allow me to pause to eat or
                  rest. I was anxious to press on, and determine that day the secret which I was
                  convinced lay entombed in this sepulchre. So again I pressed onward,—this time
                  more slowly,—having to pick my way among the bits of jagged granite filling up
                  terraces sliced out of the mountain, around enormous rocks projecting across my
                  path,—overhanging precipices that sheered straight down into dark abysses (I must
                  have verged round to a different side from that I came up on),—creeping through
                  narrow passages formed by the junction of two immense boulders. Tearing my hands
                  with the sharp corners of the rocks, I climbed in vain hope of at last seeing the
                  summit. Still rocks piled on rocks faced my wearied eyes, vainly striving to
                  pierce through some chink or cranny into the space behind them. Still rocks,
                  rocks, rocks, against whose adamantine sides my feeble will dashed restlessly and
                  impotently. My eyeballs almost burst, as it seemed, in the intense effort to
                  strain through those stone prison-walls. And by one of those curious links of
                  association by which two distant scenes are united as one, I seemed again to be
                  sitting in my garret, striving to pierce the darkness for an answer to the
                  question then raised, and at the same moment passed over me, like the sweep of
                  angels' wings, the consciousness of that Presence which had there infolded me. And
                  with that consciousness, the eager, irritated waves of excitement died away, and
                  there was a calm, in which I no longer beat like a caged beast against the
                  never-ending rocks, but, borne irresistibly along in the strong current of a
                  mighty, still emotion, pressed on with a certainty that left no room for
                  excitement, because none for doubt. And so I came upon it. Swinging round one more
                  rock, hanging over a breathless precipice, and landing upon the summit of the
                  mountain, I beheld it stretched at my feet: a lake about five miles in
                  circumference, bedded like an eye in the naked, bony rock surrounding it, with
                  quiet rippling waters placidly smiling in the level rays of the afternoon sun,—the
                  Unfathomable Secret, the Mystery of Ages, the long sought for, the Source of the
                  Nile.</p>
               <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7187-00000018"/>
               <p>For, from a broad cleft in the rocks, the water hurled itself out of its
                  hiding-place, and, dashing down over its rocky bed, rushed impetuous over the
                  sloping country, till, its force being spent, it waded tediously through the
                  slushing reeds of the hill-land again, and so rolled down to sea. For, while I
                  stood there, it seemed as if my vision were preternaturally sharpened, and I
                  followed the bright river in its course, through the alternating marsh and
                  desert,—through the land where Zeus went banqueting among the blameless
                  Ethiopians,—through the land where the African princes watched from afar the
                  destruction of Cambyses's army,—past Meroë, Thebes, Cairo; bearing upon its
                  heaving; bosom anon the cradle of Moses, the gay vessels of the inundation
                  festivals, the stately processions of the mystic priesthood, the gorgeous barge of
                  Cleopatra, the victorious trireme of Antony, the screaming vessels of fighting
                  soldiers, the stealthy boats of Christian monks, the glittering, changing,
                  flashing tumult of thousands of years of life,—ever flowing, ever ebbing, with the
                  mystic river, on whose surface it seethed and bubbled. And the germ of all this
                  vast varying scene lay quietly hidden in the wonderful lake at my feet. But human
                  life is always composed of inverted cones, whose bases, upturned to the eye,
                  present a vast area, diversified with countless phenomena; but when the screen
                  that closes upon them a little below the surface is removed, we shall be able to
                  trace the many-lined figures, each to its simple apex,—one little point containing
                  the essence and secret of the whole. Once or twice in the course of a lifetime are
                  a few men permitted to catch a glimpse of these awful Beginnings,—to touch for a
                  minute the knot where all the tangled threads ravel themselves out smoothly. I had
                  found such a place,—had had such an ineffable vision,—and, overwhelmed with
                  tremendous awe, I sank on my knees, lost in GOD.</p>
               <p>After a while, as far as I can recollect, I rose and began to take the customary
                  observations, marked the road by which I had come up the mountain, and planned a
                  route for rejoining Herndon. But ere long all subordinate thoughts and actions
                  seemed to be swallowed up in the great tide of thought and feeling that
                  overmastered me. I scarcely remember anything from the time when the lake first
                  burst upon my view, till I met Herndon again. But I know that, as the day was
                  nearly spent, I was obliged to give up the attempt to travel back that night,
                  especially as I now began to feel the exhaustion attendant upon my long journey
                  and fasting. I could not have slept among those; rocks, eternal guardians of the
                  mighty secret. The absence of all breathing, transitory existence but my own
                  rendered it too solemn for me to dare to intrude there. So I went back to the
                  forest (I returned much quicker than I had come), ate some supper, and, wrapped in
                  a blanket I had brought with me, went to sleep under the arching branches of a
                  tree. I have as little recollection of my next day's journey, except that I
                  defined a diagonal, and thus avoided the bend. I found Herndon waiting in front of
                  the tent, rather impatient for my arrival.</p>
               <p>"Halloo, old fellow! "he shouted, jumping up at seeing me, "I was really getting
                  scared about you. Where have you been? What have you seen? What are our chances?
                  Have you had any adventures? killed any lions, or anything? By-the-by, I had a
                  narrow escape with one yesterday. Capital shot; but prudence is the better part of
                  valor, you know. But, really," he said again, apparently struck by my abstraction
                  of manner, "what <emph>have</emph> you seen?"</p>
               <p>"I have found the source of the Nile," I said, simply.</p>
               <p>Is it not strange, that, when we have a great thing to say, we are always
                  compelled to speak so simply in monosyllables<pb n="36-37"
                     xml:id="VAC7187-00000019"/> syllables? Perhaps this, too, is an example of the
                  law that continually reduces many to one,—the unity giving the substance of the
                  plurality; but as the heroes of the "Iliad" were obliged to repeat the messages of
                  the gods <foreign xml:lang="LAT">literatim,</foreign> so we must say a great thing
                  as it comes to us, by itself. It is curious to me now that I was not the least
                  excited in announcing the discovery,—not because I did not feel the force of it,
                  but because my mind was so filled, so to speak, so saturated, with the idea, that
                  it was perfectly even with itself, though raised to an immensely higher level. In
                  smaller minds an idea seizes upon one part of them, thus inequalizing it with the
                  rest, and so, throwing them off their balance, they are literally
                  <emph>de</emph>ranged (or disarranged) with excitement. It was so with Herndon.
                  For a minute he stared at me in stupefied astonishment, and then burst into a
                  torrent of incoherent congratulations.</p>
               <p>"Why, Zeitzer!" he cried, "you are the lucky man, after all. Why, your fortune's
                  made,—you'll be the greatest man of the age. You must come to America; that is the
                  place for appreciating such things. You'll have a Common-Council dinner in Boston,
                  and a procession in New York. Your book will sell like wild-fire. You'll be a lion
                  of the first magnitude. Just think! The Man who discovered the Source of the
                  Nile!"</p>
               <p>I stood bewildered, like one suddenly awakened from sleep. The unusual excitement
                  in one generally so self-possessed and indifferent as my companion made me wonder
                  sufficiently; but these allusions to my greatness, my prospects, completely
                  astounded me. What had I done,—I who had been chosen, and led step by step, with
                  little interference of my own, to this end? What did this talk of noise and
                  clamorous notoriety mean?</p>
               <p>"To think," Herndon ran on, "that you should have beaten me, after all! that you
                  should have first seen, first drunk of, first bathed in——"</p>
               <p>"Drunk of! bathed in!" I repeated, mechanically. "Herndon, are you crazy? Would I
                  dare to profane the sacred fountain?"</p>
               <p>He made no reply, unless a quizzical smile might be considered as such,—but drew
                  me within the tent, out of hearing of the two Egyptians, and bade me give an
                  account of my adventures. When I had finished,—</p>
               <p>"This is grand!" he exclaimed. "Now, if you will share the benefits of this
                  discovery with me, I will halve the cost of starting that steamboat I spoke of,
                  and our plan will soon be afloat. I shouldn't wonder, now, if one might not, in
                  order to start the town, get up some kind of a little summer-pavilion there, on
                  the top of the mountain,—something on the plan of the Tip-Top House at Mount
                  Washington, you know,—hang the stars and stripes off the roof, if you're not
                  particular, and call it the Teuton-American. That would give you your rightful
                  priority, you see. By the beard of the Prophet, as they say in Cairo, the thing
                  would take!"</p>
               <p>I laughed heartily at this idea, and tried, at first in jest, then earnestly, to
                  make him understand I had no such plans in connection with my discovery; that I
                  only wanted to extend the amount of knowledge in the world,—not the number of
                  ice-cream pavilions. I offered to let him take the whole affair into his own
                  hands,—cost, profit, and all. I wanted nothing to do with it. But he was too
                  honest, as he thought, for that, and still talked and argued,—giving his most
                  visionary plans a definite, tangible shape and substance by a certain process of
                  metallicizing, until they had not merely elbowed away the last shadow of doubt,
                  but had effectually taken possession of the whole ground, and seemed to be the
                  only consequences possible upon<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7187-00000020"/> such a
                  discovery. My dislike to personal traffic in the sublimities of truth began to
                  waver. I felt keenly the force of the argument which Herndon used repeatedly,
                  that, if I did not thus claim the monopoly, (he talked almost as if I had invented
                  something,) some one else would, and so injustice be added to what I had termed
                  vulgarity. I felt that I must prevent injustice, at least. Besides, what should I
                  have to show for all my trouble, (ah! little had I thought of "<emph>I</emph>" or
                  my trouble a short time ago!)—what should I have gained, after all,—nay, what
                  would there be gained for any one,—if I merely announced my discovery,
                  without——starting the steamboat? And though I did feebly query whether I should be
                  equally bound to establish a communication, with pecuniary emolument, to the North
                  Pole, in case I discovered that, his remark, that this was the Nile, and had
                  nothing to do with the North Pole, was so forcible and pertinent, that I felt
                  ashamed of my suggestion; and upon second thought, that idea of the dinner and
                  procession really had a good deal in it. I had been in New York, and knew the
                  length of Broadway; and at the recollection felt flattered by the thought of being
                  conveyed in an open chariot drawn by four or even eight horses, with nodding
                  plumes, (literal ones for the horses,—only metaphorical ones for me,) past those
                  stately buildings fluttering with handkerchiefs, and through streets black with
                  people thronging, to see the man who had solved the riddle of Africa. And then it
                  would be pleasant, too, to make a neat little speech to the Common
                  Council,—letting the brave show catch its own tail in its mouth, by proving that,
                  if America did not achieve everything, she could appreciate—yes, appreciate was
                  the word—those who did. Yes, this would be a fitting consummation; I would do
                  it.</p>
               <p>But, ah! how dim became the vision of that quiet lake on the summit of the
                  mountain! How that vivid lightning-revelation faded into obscurity! Was Pharaoh
                  again ascending his fatal chariot?</p>
               <p>The next day we started for the ascent. We determined to follow the course of the
                  river backwards around the bend, and set out from my former starting-point, as any
                  other course might lead us into a hopeless dilemma. We had no difficulty in
                  finding the sandy plain, and soon reached landmarks which I was sure were on the
                  right road; but a tramp of six or eight hours—still in the road I had passed
                  before—brought us no nearer to our goal. In short, we wandered three days in that
                  desert, utterly in vain. My heart sunk within me at every failure; with sickening
                  anxiety I scanned the horizon at every point, but nothing was visible but stunted
                  bushes and white pebbles glistening in the glaring sand.</p>
               <p>The fourth day came,—and Herndon at last stopped short, and said, in his steady,
                  immobile voice,—</p>
               <p>"Zeitzer, you must have made this grand discovery in your dreams. There is no Nile
                  up this way,—and our water-skins are almost dry. We had better return and follow
                  up the course of the river where we left it. If we again fail, I shall return to
                  Egypt to carry out my plan for converting the Pyramids into ice-houses. They are
                  excellently well adapted for the purpose, and in that country a good supply of ice
                  is a <foreign xml:lang="LAT">desideratum.</foreign> Indeed, if my plan meets with
                  half the success it deserves, the antiquaries two centuries hence will conclude
                  that ice was the original use of those structures.</p>
               <p>"Shade of Cheops, forbid! "I exclaimed.</p>
               <p>"Cheops be hanged!" returned my irreverent companion. "The world suffers too much
                  now from overcrowded population to permit a man to claim standing-room three
                  thousand years after his death,—especially<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7187-00000021"
                  /> when the claim is for some acres apiece, as in the case of these
                  pyramid-builders. Will you go back with me?"</p>
               <p>I declined for various reasons, not all very clear even to myself; but I was
                  convinced that his peculiar enticements were the cause of our failure, and I hated
                  him unreasonably for it. I longed to get rid of him, and of his influence over me.
                  Fool that I was! <emph>I</emph> was the sinner, and not he; for he
                     <emph>could</emph> not see, because he was born blind, while <emph>I</emph>
                  fell with my eyes open. I still held on to the vague hope, that, were I alone, I
                  might again find that mysterious lake; for I knew I had not dreamed. So we
                  parted.</p>
               <p>But we two (my servant and I) were not left long alone in the Desert. The next day
                  a party of natives surprised us, and, after some desperate fighting, we were taken
                  prisoners, sold as slaves from tribe to tribe into the interior, and at length
                  fell into the hands of some traders on the western coast, who gave us our freedom.
                  Unwilling, however, to return home without some definite success, I made several
                  voyages in a merchant-vessel. But I was born for one purpose; failing in that, I
                  had nothing further to live for. The core of my life was touched at that fatal
                  river, and a subtile disease has eaten it out till nothing but the rind is left. A
                  wave, gathering to the full its mighty strength, had upreared itself for a moment
                  majestically above its fellows,—falling, its scattered spray can only impotently
                  sprinkle the dull, dreary shore. Broken and nerveless, I can only wait the lifting
                  of the curtain, quietly wondering if a failure be always irretrievable,—if a prize
                  once lost can never again be found.</p>

               <head>II. MY THREE CONVERSATIONS WITH MISS CHESTER.</head>
               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
                  <p>I WAS at a party; where, is none of your business, and immaterial to the
                     following relation. On second thoughts, however, as localization increases the
                     interest of a narrative, I will say, at New York, in a Fifth Avenue palace.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps it would be well to say something introductory about myself. I was
                     twenty-five—between you and me, fair reader, I am not so very much older
                     now—tall, well-formed, strong and active, both mentally and physically, and an
                     extensive and omnivorous reader and student. The only trait of my character
                     which has any special significance, relatively to the matter in hand is, that I
                     have a considerable endowment of that magnetic power used in throwing
                     "sensitives," as they are technically termed, into the mesmeric state, although
                     I very seldom exerted it, and my possession of it was known, I believe, only to
                     myself. Did it never happen to you, respected reader, when looking intently
                     into a person's eyes during conversation, that you <emph>saw</emph> the
                     thought, and even the very words, which passed through his or her mind, in
                     comment or reply? The whole group of phenomena, of which that is one—embracing
                     some classes of dreams, much mental action, animal magnetism, biology, the
                     whole circle, in fact, of physico-psychological science—is, at this present
                     writing, the most profound, comprehensively, multitudinously<pb n="42-43"
                        xml:id="VAC7187-00000022"/> ously and variously related, the most promising,
                     important and intensely interesting, and the least understood, of all the
                     departments of human knowledge. I wish I could stop to indicate a few of the
                     complex and astonishingly intimate ramifications by which this philosophy—the
                     philosophy of the combined and reciprocal interaction of mind and body, the
                     wondrous march or border-territory whereon spirit and matter bear conflicting
                     and contested sway—underlies and entwines itself with human interests and human
                     actions. But that is not my present design; and for the narrator, especially,
                     must <foreign xml:lang="LAT">hoc age</foreign> be inscribed upon his pen. Mind
                        <emph>this;</emph> not that, nor the other.</p>
                  <p>The relevancy of these remarks consists in this, namely that the few
                     circumstances which I propose to narrate are an actual exemplification of the
                     working of the laws to whose existence and influence I have alluded. I have
                     permission from the lady most interested to record and publish them; for,
                     however insignificant in themselves, they will, at least, form some portion of
                     the archives from which a future generation is certainly to draw facts
                     cooperative in constructing a fabric of universal philosophy, more marvellous
                     in architecture, and more immeasurably magnificent in dimensions, than any the
                     wildest dream hitherto figured by the loftiest human intellect. This splendor,
                     however, is of course. Systems of actual truth, the work of the All-powerful—as
                     their awful vastness unveils itself before human eyes—must as much transcend
                     the beauty and the size of the one-sided little elaborations of human minds, as
                     the unimaginable splendors of evening clouds excel the blue and yellow dabs of
                     that landscape-goat of a "paintaster," Skumble; as the great palaces of the
                     heavens surpass the ecclesiological glories of the Wooden Gothic.</p>
                  <p>I had selected, according to my custom, a corner, from which I was making my
                     ordinary use of the company, viz.: studying their lives from their faces, and
                     working the detail of expressions and postures into connection with the
                     preëxistent mass of mental philosophy, whose acquisition and arrangement had
                     been my study for years.</p>
                  <p>All the usual varieties of young men and women passed in review before the
                     uninteresting person in the corner. I was not dressed in fine raiment, wore no
                     gloves, was not known as a "lion;" known, indeed at all, to only two or three
                     besides my cousin, the daughter of the house, and only very slightly known even
                     to them and to her. So, nobody stopped to talk with me; and, as I had arranged
                     with cousin Ellen to let me alone, save when I should ask to be introduced, I
                     had a fair opportunity for my secret espials. It was a curious and entertaining
                     spectacle, when rightly viewed. First, I generalized my eyesight—if the
                     expression be allowable—and gazed upon the moving mass before me, without
                     reference to any particular individual. This, especially during the dances,
                     furnished a droll spectacle. Such another may be observed by gazing in the same
                     general manner at a church, all waving with fans, like a flock of great
                     butterflies over a bed of gay cabbages, on a hot Sunday in summer: and another,
                     more decided in character, by observing the simultaneous nutations of heads,
                     fingers, and arms in an orchestra. These effects are different from that of a
                     band of marching men; for the entire body of these last moves forward by
                     rhythmic progressions, while in the cases just instanced, the company
                     considered together, is stationary; and the rhythmic movement of individual
                     limbs and instruments throws only an atmosphere, as it were, of ordered motion
                     over the whole.</p>
                  <p>I threw out of consideration the bodies of the dancers, and only observed their
                     heads. A strong volition of a few<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7187-00000023"/>
                     minutes' duration enabled me entirely to lose the remembrance of bodies, and to
                     free myself from the sensations coming from the sound of the music; and so,
                     from the silent motions of the dancers, and the accompanying expressions of the
                     faces,—in quadrille dances especially,—there arose before me a spectacle of
                     such intense absurdity that I was forced to break off my occupation to avoid an
                     obtrusive laugh. I was beholding only faces, it will be remembered, as solely
                     as if I had been looking at heads cut off. The expressions upon nearly all of
                     them were of intense solemnity. Nearly upon a level, they bobbed up and down in
                     couples and fours; swam about, cocking themselves oddly to one side or to the
                     other; turned towards each other in the alternations of rest, and gibbered
                     slightly; anon, launched forth again upon the inane vagaries of their solemn
                     mummery, I nearly laughed aloud, but ceased gazing: and, forthwith, grew angry.
                     Apish phantasms of silly sport, the winking, wiggling heads, were a fair
                     representation of the earnestness with which the "first circles" bury
                     themselves in the mindless frivolities of polite society. I was angry that the
                     observances of fashion should be so much regarded, even by the brainless
                     nobodies who gabbled and fluttered before me; and with a most expansive and
                     ardent aspiration after the Apotheosis of Labor, I left the dancers to their
                     aimless evolutions.</p>
                  <p>Then I made a similar experiment upon the heterogeneous volume of sounds that
                     arose from the social hubbub of the rooms. Not listening to any single voice, I
                     regarded only the clacking, clattering rattle that flowed turbulently up from
                     so many voices, mingled with the monotonous dance-music of the two German
                     fiddlers, the harpist and pianist, who officiated as orchestra. The din was
                     stunning. It was as if the English language had been torn into ragged angular
                     scraps and fragments, and vociferated at the utmost possible speed, and
                     entirely at random, by the whole company. Now and then a shrill laugh, or one
                     or two connected words loudly articulated, jumped up from the rough average of
                     the confused noise. The harsh fiddle-notes darted and streamed up and down
                     among the tumult, like so many vocal squibs; and the harp and piano were
                     scarcely audible. A minute or two of such listening satisfied me, and I
                     returned to my invidious business of watching my neighbors.</p>
                  <p>A flaxen-haired and flaxen-moustached dandy, whose unnaturally slender limbs,
                     cased, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">secundum artem,</foreign> in skintight pants,
                     would almost qualify him for the workhouse under the vagrant laws, as "having
                     no visible means of support," stood "diddling" (<abbr>i. e.</abbr> imitating
                     the movements of a wretch in an ague-fit), after the approved fashion, and
                     expending washy conversation and washier smiles upon a female counterpart. Two
                     or three city damsels, very much alike, all having the fair complexions,
                     slender forms and large fringed eyes, so common among metropolitan
                     beauties,—were giggling and chattering, in the enjoyment of that fluent ladies'
                     talk so incomprehensible and unattainable to us stupid and slow-tongued men.
                     Two or three wizzled antiques of the same sex mumbled sourly together upon a
                     sofa. Several fat mothers conversed in awful conclave, on the other side of the
                     room; and in the middle, the varying dances wove their interminable tangle.</p>
                  <p>With her back towards me, so near that I could almost hear her words, stood a
                     tall young woman dressed in black, with magnificent shoulders and arms, with
                     raven-black hair of great fineness, length and volume, and a dark but
                     peculiarly transparent complexion. She was surrounded by several gentlemen,
                     whom she seemed at no loss to entertain, at least so far as to bear her full
                     share in the<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7187-00000024"/> conversation, and in the
                     commerce of wits, whatever they might be; for there seemed to be in the circle
                     much laughter, though not of the pleasantest sort. As I watched the group, I
                     saw one and another of the gentlemen's faces redden, when the others laughed;
                     one or two grew preternaturally sober, and quietly left that part of the room.
                     The lady's noble head, haughtily set upon her neck, moved now and then with an
                     almost imperceptible gesture of disdain or anger. I quietly drew a little
                     nearer; not to listen to the conversation, but to observe the heads. The faces
                     of the men were all foolish and conceited; and they were, as it happened, all
                     fair-haired. Although I could not see the lady's face, yet the dark masses of
                     her hair and dress, and the height and volume of her head, her self-possessed
                     attitude, the minute gesture of which I spoke, and the short and keen replies
                     which she shot about, rendered the contrast of characters, as she stood among
                     the young men, extreme and striking.</p>
                  <p>She stood talking with her retinue for a considerable time; and afterwards with
                     others who approached. I observed her steadily and intently, watching her head,
                     her temperament, her form, and her demeanor. All were faultless; at least, even
                     with a sufficiently critical disposition, and much experience in estimating
                     phrenological, physiological, and psychological characteristics, I could not
                     see anything to change. I did not, however, as I said, see the front of her
                     head. I gazed and gazed, until I became absorbed in my contemplations; and in
                     considering their consequent and collateral reflections, my meditations
                     eventuated in a profound reverie of a dim and undefinable character. All my
                     thoughts, at first, seemed centred upon the individual lady at whom I had been
                     looking. But I lost track of them; and it seemed, afterwards, as if I had
                     entered into a state resembling that which Asiatic ascetics believe they can
                     attain by unending reiterations of their sacred name.</p>
                  <p>I was aroused from entire forgetfulness of time and place, by some sudden and
                     uncomfortable sensation, which made me for an instant suspect that I had been
                     struck, although I could not say where. Upon this unceremonious recall of my
                     fugitive wits, whatever its nature might be, I looked again at the fair object
                     of my speculations; and with such a feeling as if I had not seen her for a long
                     time. For the sudden change from abstracted reverie of intense contemplation,
                     to mere ordinary intuition, was quite great enough to cause the requisite break
                     in the current of my consciousness. The strange beauty, for some reason or
                     other, was blushing deeply—at least it is improbable that so brilliant a color
                     would incarnadine her neck, and not her cheeks and brow. Deeply she blushed for
                     some unknown reason, and almost immediately she moved away, without turning her
                     head, saying something which I could not hear, to a distant part of the
                     room.</p>
                  <p>I recurred to my cogitations upon the flitting figures before me, but still my
                     thoughts recurred to the "dark ladye." I felt certain that she must be well
                     worth acquaintance. It could hardly be possible that one evidently of so
                     remarkable natural endowments, should not present a rare study for the
                     philosopher—especially for the philosopher in living minds. I desired to
                     complete my new discovery. My snug corner became dull. I left it; and edged and
                     twisted about the lofty rooms, pretending great need to arrive at some point in
                     advance, which, like the beetle with buttered horns, I carried forward as I
                     went. Up and down I wormed about; sometimes looking earnestly at the other side
                     of the room in general, sometimes peering with emphasis at a feigned something
                     among the closely crowded male and female shoulders around me; until, after
                     making a<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7187-00000025"/> good deal of trouble, and
                     many skilful evolutions, I unsuspectedly established myself to my satisfaction
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en échelon</foreign> and to the front of my unknown.
                     Thus, I was in better luck than before, in my philosophical pursuit. For while
                     I was as well hidden from her as before, by the densely aggregated and moving
                     mass of the crowd, a skilful adjustment of my operations would preserve me from
                     annoying her, while I could study her face and gesture-language to much better
                     advantage.</p>
                  <p>Of her face, the lower half was perfect but not peculiar, unless for the firm
                     closure of the full lips. The eyes were large, black, and deep-set. The
                     eyebrows fell with an unusual slope at the outer end of the eye. The forehead
                     rose high above, full and steep, like an intellectual man's forehead; and in
                     those portions which would be its four angles, were it a parallelogram laid
                     athwart the face, fuller than any I had ever observed. And in looking, again I
                     glided into deep and concentrated musings; and again, from a state of profound
                     reverie, I was aroused by such another shock as I had felt before. Again I
                     gathered together my scattered thoughts; and as soon as I had retraced their
                     lost clue up to the passing moment, again I looked towards the dark beauty who
                     had so much attracted me. She had changed her position, and was looking another
                     way; but again, whether from some casualty of conversation, or from having
                     noticed my persistent gaze, she was blushing.</p>
                  <p>Beginning, now, to be actuated by a desire to obtain by conversation the
                     complement of the scanty knowledge with which mere exterior observation had
                     supplied me, and thus to secure some satisfactory acquaintance with, one who, I
                     did not doubt, possessed unusual gifts, I forthwith resorted to Cousin Ellen.
                     From her I requested an introduction to my fair unknown; at the same time
                     inquiring in general as to her name and condition. She was, Ellen said, a Miss
                     Irene Chester; the daughter of a farmer in one of the small seaport towns of
                     Fairfield county, Connecticut; an assistant teacher in one of the city schools;
                     an old schoolmate of hers, cousin Ellen's; here in society for almost the first
                     time, but already making quite a sensation; nicknamed "The Two-edged Sword,"
                     from the keenness of her repartees; always a strange girl; invited on the
                     ground of the school-fellowship, having, I think, been Ellen's room-mate;
                     perhaps not known at all in city society, beyond Ellen's immediate circle; of
                     great conversational talent, a student, a reader, and otherwise
                     accomplished.</p>
                  <p>These last, namely, the study, reading, and accomplishments, a trifle unsettled
                     me; for ladies with those recommendations usually gabble and dabble, but little
                     else. Yet I took comfort from the omen of power in the nickname, and
                     persisted.</p>
                  <p>Miss Chester heard my name and the recital of my cousinship to the pretty
                     hostess, with considerable frigidity; looked me clearly in the eye as I
                     accosted her, and waited, apparently under the influence of some dislike or
                     disinclination to speak, for me to begin.</p>
                  <p>These cool receptions are very much more adapted to vivify one's anger than
                     one's intellect. I burned in inward wrath and outward speechlessness, for a
                     minute or so; then suddenly adopting a resolution, I drove away the rage,
                     assumed as pretty a simper as I could muster, and ventured to remark, with an
                     air of great interest and (I flatter myself) a well executed "diddle,"</p>
                  <p>"It's very fine weather, Miss Chester."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
                  <p>"Unusually crowded rooms this evening. How tiresome it is to be squeezed up
                     among so many disagreeable, vulgar people!"</p>
                  <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7187-00000026"/>
                  <p>"Do you think so?" said she, with a sort of glimmer in her eye. "If it is so
                     disagreeable, what made you come?"</p>
                  <p>"Self-denial," answered I, "is healthy for the soul. And aside from that
                     excellent reason"—here I rather exaggerated my simper and my diddle, to the
                     young lady's evident disgust—"I must have had a presentiment of pleasure
                     reserved for me, in the acquisition of so delightful an acquaintance as Miss
                     Chester." I accompanied the last words with a culminating grin, and as silly a
                     bow as I could contrive.</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Are</emph> you acquainted with me?" she asked, with a curious observing
                     expression of eye and of lip, as much as to say, "Behold here a new and strange
                     variety of baboon."</p>
                  <p>I sniggered after the most approved style, and answered with the fashionable
                     euphuistic dialect, at which I could easily see that Miss Chester's disdain and
                     anger were flaming almost unendurably,</p>
                  <p>"He, he, he! Ah flattah meself that I am competent to elucidate and analyze
                     charactahs at short notice. But you must be weary with standing so long. Pahmit
                     me to wait Upon you to the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tête-à-tête</foreign>
                     opposite; and if you will allow me, ah shall be exceedingly delighted to
                     fahnish you a specimen of my powahs in that line."</p>
                  <p>"By all means, sir," said Miss Chester. "I thank you."</p>
                  <p>So we sat down.</p>
                  <p>"I must make one preface," said I. "I presume that a young lady of Miss
                     Chester's talents and information" (another disdain-provoking bow from me) "is
                     aware that such observation as I have been able to make, cannot reveal what
                     modifications circumstances and occupation may have engrafted upon your
                     original character. Permit me, therefore, to ask that you will just tell me
                     what and where your life has been."</p>
                  <p>"Not one single syllable," returned she, with evident pleasure in a short
                     refusal. "You pretended to an acquaintance with me, and offered to prove it.
                     And now, when it comes to the trial, you already begin to feel about for such
                     scraps and hints as you may hope to coax out of me, after the usual fashion of
                     fortune-tellers. I thought it would be so. I don't believe you know yourself,
                     and to pretend to know me, whom you never saw before, and probably never will
                     again! How should you? And why should you?"</p>
                  <p>"I know this, at least," said I, quietly, and dropping my baboonery, "that you
                     are quite angry, and that you have acquired a sudden and immeasurable contempt
                     for me. Is it not so?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes," said she, promptly, and with inconsiderate but full sincerity; for she
                     spoke in answer to all my conversation and manners, up to my last question.
                     Then she started, and looking at me in hasty alarm, and reflecting what her
                     answer had been, added, "No;" for she comprehended for the first time the
                     indications afforded by the new tone of the query.</p>
                  <p>"Hot and cold," I replied. "However, both answers are right. No matter for the
                     apparent inconsistency. Deeper thinkers than either of us have decided that
                     truth may oftentimes best be presented by the assertion of incompatible
                     extremes."</p>
                  <p>"I think you are correct," said Miss Chester, "but I don't know how you could
                     tell. However, as to that notion about presenting truth, it behooves to be
                     careful lest the poor creature perish between its two incompatible bundles of
                     hay. Well, sir; now, if you will please commence the proof positive of
                     acquaintance?"</p>
                  <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7187-00000027"/>
                  <p>"Yes." I scanned her face a moment, and added, "You do not like to attend
                     church."</p>
                  <p>"I do, too," she replied, hastily. "You are wrong there."</p>
                  <p>"You are glad to think so," I said. "But think a moment. I do not mean that you
                     dislike religious services. But does not very much of the church choir music
                     displease you?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes."</p>
                  <p>"And the prayers—were you never perplexed with a troublesome feeling that
                     somehow they were not <emph>your</emph> prayers?</p>
                  <p>"And the sermon—I am sure you have often shocked your friends by staying at
                     home and reading one, when they were sure you ought to have been at
                     church."</p>
                  <p>"Pshaw!" said Miss Chester, "you found that out from Cousin Ellen."</p>
                  <p>"Not at all. I stated the particular fact merely as one phase of a
                     characteristic which ramifies into many manifestations. You are what is
                     sometimes called 'original'—I mean slow of belief, and independent in
                     reasoning. You examine doctrine and precept for yourself. The rapid statements
                     of a sermon—of any oral discussion of a subject, do not satisfy you. You want
                     to examine, to compare, to weigh. That accounts for your preferring to read
                     sermons rather than to hear them. In general, you dislike lectures and public
                     addresses, on whatever subjects; and in general, you prefer to read on them
                     rather than to hear. As to the prayers, you are wrong to allow yourself in the
                     feeling, though I am right in stating it to you. The dissatisfaction is owing
                     to your defeat of sympathy, either with congregation or preacher. If you would
                     abandon yourself to a generous participation in petitions which are only such
                     as universal petitions must of necessity be, you would reap good from the
                     prayer. The music, not to speak of its usual wretched execution, is unpleasant
                     to you, as a dishonest pretence of praise, offered usually by the irreligious
                     and profane lips of persons who chant hymns to God, not because hymns overflow
                     from hearts full of love, but because in their individual cases, the laryngeal
                     membranes and tissues possess unusual motive and vibratory power. You see that
                     my observations are merely individual corollaries from the premises of honesty,
                     good observing and reflecting faculties, and musical temperament."</p>
                  <p>"It appears, then," said Miss Chester, "that your acquaintance is one not of
                     very long standing, and hypothetical and extemporaneous to an extreme."</p>
                  <p>"But have I not spoken truly?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I believe so," said she, "although the things you say are such, as for
                     some reason or other had not been articulately presented to me exactly in that
                     way. I hardly knew them, if at all. And what is more," she added, with a
                     troubled look, "I do not like to be so easily read. I had thought myself safe
                     in unintelligibility."</p>
                  <p>"While," I rejoined, "you fancied that nobody else had got beyond 'baker' and
                     'shady.'"</p>
                  <p>"Excuse the long word. I will plead the privilege of my pedagogy for that,
                     though. But as to your discoveries; I see that things which I certainly never
                     told to anybody, are known outside of my own mind. The more I think of it, the
                     less I like it."</p>
                  <p>"But you should not dislike truth," I said.</p>
                  <p>"The truth is not to be spoken at all times. Nor is it always best or necessary
                     to have it known, even."</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps not," I answered. "But I will proceed with my analysis."</p>
                  <p>"No," said Miss Chester, hastily. "You have said enough already. I——You——"</p>
                  <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7187-00000028"/>
                  <p>"One single remark let me make, however," I answered, and I now looked steadily
                     into eyes that did not endure my gaze. "Just one thing. You do not despise me
                     any longer. And you are half afraid of me, and the rest, I fear, is
                     dislike."</p>
                  <p>"I won't tell you anything about it," she replied, with an alarmed
                     sharpness.</p>
                  <p>"Very well; quite as well," I rejoined. "A good observer is like a good
                     arithmetician. He proves his work as he goes along; he does not need to look
                     for 'the answer in the book.' But let me ask you if you play chess?"</p>
                  <p>"I do. Not much; but I am very fond of it."</p>
                  <p>"Will you give me leave to come and play a game with you?" I asked.</p>
                  <p>I had permission; and thus our conversation ended for the evening.</p>
                  <p>It is no part of the design of this plain statement of facts, to produce any
                     dramatic surprises. So I will plainly say, that by this time I was exceedingly
                     delighted with my new acquaintance, and, indeed, to all intents and purposes,
                     thoroughly and suddenly "in love at first sight."</p>
                  <p>But as to the nature of her opinions, in regard to me, except for the brief
                     synopsis which I had mentioned to herself, and which, also I was confident of,
                     in respect to my estimate of their kind, but not of their degree, I could form
                     no guess. But respect is much.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER SECOND.</head>
                  <p>MISS CHESTER, in truth, was almost my ideal, in point of personal attractions;
                     namely, the embodiment of health and strength, under the lovely feminine
                     limitations imposed by the laws and graceful lines of womanly beauty; and I
                     felt a certainty which long observation and study in psychology and physiology
                     might justify, that her mind was worthy even of a nobler casket, if such a one
                     were imaginable. The fine hair, so inscrutably dark; the deep liquid eyes,
                     whose unfathomable irises seemed, as I gazed into them, overflowing as
                     redundant fountains into the clear white eyeballs; the dark and clear
                     transparency of skin, demonstrated (a rare conjunction) quickness and
                     endurance, not bodily only, but intellectual. The great volume of the head, the
                     noble lofty forehead, the height of the upper cerebral region, proved as surely
                     her intellectual excellence; which, in such a character as hers, must have been
                     sustained and developed by the severe discipline of her work as a teacher. For,
                     although the fact is seldom recognised, and indeed little known, no occupation
                     on earth furnishes so comprehensive, invigorating, and symmetrical an exercise
                     for the maturing, or matured mind, as the quiet and neglected business of
                     "teaching school." And although disagreeable conclusions might seem suggested
                     by the sharp words which I was certain she had distributed plentifully to the
                     amiable youths, my predecessors in conversation, of which she had given me a
                     specimen or two, and of which the surname she had acquired might be reckoned a
                     boding omen, yet they pleased me. For the wretched dandies richly deserved
                     them. And how natural was it, for a strong and clear mind like hers, full of
                     noble thoughts, and the power to live them out, to be kindled into sparkling
                     and blazing anger at the witless drivel of the butterflies she crushed!
                     Moreover, I remembered with keen delight, how the wrathful contempt which my
                     simulated folly had provoked, faded out forthwith, as soon as I spoke true and
                     clear thoughts to her; how her maiden pride, so pardonably and beautifully<pb
                        n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7187-00000029"/> fully lofty and outspoken, when she
                     felt that her interlocutors dwelt in a sphere far below her—when she flashed
                     lightnings of scorn down upon their puny heads from the ethereal air of her own
                     inaccessible and uninvaded realm of thought—had fled, abashed; how with
                     truthful and maidenly honesty infinitely more lovely than her beautiful anger,
                     and which was the basis, to me reflecting upon it, of deep delicious musings,
                     she had recognised in me an intelligence honest and like her own, in kind at
                     least, even if (which I never doubted) her womanhood had clothed her with the
                     great womanly prerogatives of deeper intuitions and more unfathomable
                     enthusiasms. And that she was a true woman still, and not a mannish unsexed
                     truant from her right life-limits, I knew; first, because I had seen so
                     plainly—and I revelled in the remembrance, not from selfish pride of power, but
                     because the fact vindicated to myself a claim of near relationship to such a
                     noble soul—because I had seen so plainly how she consented to respect my
                     masculine prerogative of self-confident and aggressive intellection; and,
                     second, because it was only with such instinctive frankness, and with such
                     sweet and close-following recoil into reluctance, that she recognised my bold
                     appeals to her own interior consciousness—my sudden invasion of her own realms
                     of silent thought—where she had before sat, sole empress, <q>
                        <l>"In maiden meditation, fancy free."</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such thoughts burdened me in daily dreams; and the current of my studious life,
                     before flowing steadily on in reading and thought, now spread itself out in
                     wide, quiet expanses of reverie; reflecting infinities of sweet thoughts, but
                     flowing onward no more. I was "deeper than ever plummet sounded," in (I
                     flattered myself) a reasonable, noble, and beautiful love.</p>
                  <p>After two or three fruitless calls, made, to my great disgust, when Miss
                     Chester happened to be out of town, or otherwise employed away from home, I
                     succeeded in finding her at leisure for the chess game which she had promised
                     me.</p>
                  <p>I was shown, that evening, into a well-furnished parlor; and in a few minutes
                     Miss Chester entered, dressed, as usual, in black. She greeted me as if I had
                     been an old acquaintance.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," said I, "that is right. We <emph>are</emph> acquainted, are we not? In
                     fact, old friends?"</p>
                  <p>"In some sense," she replied, "it certainly does seem as if I had known you a
                     long time; or rather, as if you had known me a long time, for I don't feel as
                     well acquainted with you as you do with me. You read thoughts with an ease
                     which frightens me."</p>
                  <p>"Where the fountain is so clear," I said, "it is no wonder that its depths are
                     searched. Turbid and muddy thoughts would have shamed your mind into a cloudy
                     secretive fear. But <emph>that</emph> would have revealed its own story,
                     too."</p>
                  <p>"I believe," said Miss Chester, "that I won't talk any more mental philosophy
                     with you. But here is our battlefield. I suppose I might as well surrender
                     without a summons, if it were not for the shame. So I challenge you to the
                     course with sharpened spears, as Ivanhoe did his wicked enemy, Brian de Bois
                     Guilbert."</p>
                  <p>"I accept the challenge, but not in the spirit of De Bois Guilbert. And in
                     token that I bear you no ill-will, I offer you the right hand of a foeman's
                     friendship."</p>
                  <p>She hesitated almost imperceptibly, but took the offered hand with a smile. I
                     had offered her mine, indeed, that I might touch hers again, and I think some
                     conscious or unconscious perception of it withheld hers.</p>
                  <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7187-00000030"/>
                  <p>"Now, then," said I as I held her hand a moment, let it go, sat down by the
                     table, emptied the chessmen upon the board, and quoted with assumed ferocity,
                     "Death to the Huguenot! Fagot and Flame!"</p>
                  <p>Miss Chester replied promptly.</p>
                  <p>"But the braggart retreated more sad than he came. There's a Roland for your
                     Oliver, sir. Still, your random shot told, for my mother was of a Huguenot
                     family from the south of France, which came over to this country about 1690,
                     and settled near New York, when John Jay's ancestors and so many more good men
                     and women fled out of France to escape the <emph>dragonnades.</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"Indeed? But now please tell me where you found the quotation with which you
                     answered mine?"</p>
                  <p>"If I can remember, certainly. And where did you get yours?"</p>
                  <p>I reflected a moment. "It is mere 'flotsam,' I suspect—a splinter from some
                     half-read poem, floating among miscellaneous <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >débris</foreign> of hurried reading. I declare I can't locate it. Stay,
                     I'll tell you. No." And I had to give it up.</p>
                  <p>"I'm not so honest as you," said Miss Chester. "I have tinkered my line—it is a
                     sort of transfer from Walter Scott's 'Search after Happiness.' The last two
                     lines, you know, are— <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"'And the king, disappointed, in sorrow and shame</l>
                           <l>Went back to Serendib as sad as he came.'</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>"I think I caught it by the jingle at the end, as one might a rattlesnake by
                     the tell-<emph>tale.</emph> Excuse the pun, please. The requisite alteration I
                     extemporized."</p>
                  <p>By this time the battle was ranged; Miss Chester, by lady's privilege, having
                     the white pieces, and I the bloody red.</p>
                  <p>I invited her to the attack with as much politeness as did the Colonel of the
                     English household troops his French adversaries at Fontenoy, and with more
                     literature; for I challenged again in verse— <q>
                        <l>"Charge, Chester, charge."</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>"For shame!" exclaimed my fair foe, laughing, however, "to pervert and parody
                     right and left in that way! I fear you don't reverence anything, sacred or
                     profane. I won't begin, now, unless the lot shall decide it so."</p>
                  <p>By lot the first move fell to me.</p>
                  <p>"I don't know," said I, scanning Miss Chester's face, "whether to attack you in
                     an ordinary or an extraordinary manner. Let me consider. You like ghost
                     stories. I shouldn't wonder if you specially enjoyed Poe's marvellous
                     imagination, 'The Fall of the House of Usher.'"</p>
                  <p>She laughed. "You are right, I declare. Do you?"</p>
                  <p>"I do, indeed. So, seeing that you take such delight in things 'strange and
                     vague,' I will treat you to a chess opening of that precise description."</p>
                  <p>And I moved, king's knight's pawn one.</p>
                  <p>In giving a cursory account of the progress of the game, I cannot of course
                     expect to make myself understood in detail by untechnical readers. But the game
                     of chess is one whose combinations and varying fortunes can perhaps be more
                     readily represented by illustrative phrases drawn from the language pertaining
                     to departments of life and action not merely lusory, than any other transaction
                     so insignificant as a sedentary amusement. I shall therefore pause a little for
                     an explanatory <foreign xml:lang="LAT">excursus.</foreign>
                  </p>
                  <p>The main series of evolutions of a game of chess may very aptly be narrated in
                     phrases applicable to a military campaign. There is the same set of material
                        conditions;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7187-00000031"/> namely, an area for
                     combat, invasive and defensive; a given force, to command; main points of
                     attack and defence; centres of operations; and necessity for intricately
                     adjusted combinations of effort, for in both cases each separate corps or
                     soldier must subserve some leading purposes, immediate or remote, or both, and
                     must also strengthen his neighbors without impeding them. The strife is decided
                     by the same conditions in the opponents, viz., equality or inequality of force,
                     or of skill, or of both, and the same qualities of mind are required; clearness
                     of perception, longanimity, boldness, decision and perseverance.</p>
                  <p>Having premised thus much, I may more intelligibly proceed to state that the
                     move with which I commenced my game was the first step of a plan of campaign
                     like that of Fabius the Delayer; a movement designedly insignificant, upon my
                     own flank, designed to induce the enemy to deploy rapidly and unwisely, and so
                     to lay her positions open to some deadly attack when the game should be in mid
                     career. I intended to hold my centre troops close around my king, and to carry
                     on my attack and defence from the sides of the game, allowing my opponent what
                     is usually supposed the decisive advantage of occupying all the central open
                     field, as the sly old Roman I mentioned, "who lurked and wandered in the
                     bailiwicks" of Apulia and of Latium, lying close among the hills, watching
                     Hannibal and waiting for chances to annoy him.</p>
                  <p>The game progressed as I expected; and in truth much more so, too. For Miss
                     Chester's forces had been manœuvred more skilfully than I had presumed upon;
                     indeed she was the only lady player I ever saw who marshalled the mimic ranks
                     with a man-like and purposeful decision and force of combinations. My plan,
                     like an illogical argument, seemed likely to develop itself only to its own
                     confusion. My deceitful Fabian policy, allowing my opponent time and space to
                     construct an impregnable array, had cramped up my own hosts within a space so
                     limited as to prevent me from developing their power anywhither. It seemed
                     likely that (in a "chess point of view") I should be slain helpless and
                     motionless, like a rat in a hole.</p>
                  <p>But it was not merely the difficulty of my chosen course of play, either, that
                     prevented the operation of my combinations. I had been struggling hard to
                     confine my attention wholly to my game; for, as a good player and a genuine
                     lover of chess, I abhorred to be beaten. My sexual pride, moreover, revolted,
                     in spite of philosophy, against being beaten by a woman, and I experienced much
                     repugnance, also, at the prospect of sharing the undesirable sensations of that

                        </lg>
                     </q> Therefore I strove to centre my mental powers upon the analytical and
                     mnemonic operations mainly valuable in chess. But, for the first time, I could
                     not do it. At one move after another, I caught myself gazing at Miss Chester,
                     instead of at the pieces, and my thoughts intensely occupied in retracing the
                     occurrences of the evening when I first met her. The violent efforts I made to
                     discontinue this irrelevant occupation, must themselves of course have used
                     much of the power which I could otherwise have bestowed on my game; and their
                     ill-success, again, left more and more of their power to expend itself upon
                     unreasonable and absurd reverie. But so it was, and I could not prevent it. The
                     time which I should have occupied—which Miss Chester <emph>did</emph> occupy—in
                     planning and combining<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7187-00000032"/> bining, I used
                     in gazing at her, as she leaned in steady study over the table; in gazing, not
                     merely with the close attention to curves and forms which, nevertheless,
                     artistic knowledge and experience did cause me to use; but with that mere
                     rapture of contemplation with which we look at what is grand and perfectly
                     magnificent, even to the satisfaction of our ideal of perfection. She nearly
                     surprised me at it, once or twice. I escaped by quickly dropping my eyes, not
                     altogether ingenuously, I fear, upon the board. Nor, had she been disposed to
                     critical observation, could the fact have escaped her that something
                     prepossessed me. For not only did such evasions cause my cheeks to tingle, but
                     they were followed by particularly asinine proceedings in my conduct of the
                     game. For, having wasted the minutes which should have found me a strong move,
                     in dreams, I then, ashamed of further delay, moved not only unpreparedly, but
                     with the additional blindness of embarrassment and anger.</p>
                  <p>We had played without remark, Miss Chester studiously, and I morosely or
                     abstractedly, for nearly an hour. It was only the slow development consequent
                     upon the line of play which I had adopted, which kept me from being checkmated
                     before. But at last I thought that I discovered the inevitable impendency of
                     checkmate in five moves. I waited to study the position fairly, and instead of
                     that, fell off into unseasonable and profound meditation. I can hardly assert
                     that I was precisely in the voluntary exercise of my ordinary mental faculties,
                     such was the extreme of my abstraction. At least I quite forgot, for the time
                     being, my place and my occupation, in dreams of delightful memory, and
                     delightful though groundless, vaticination. But these were suddenly shattered
                     into destruction by a spasm or blow which vibrated in some mysterious way
                     through all the chambers of my being. I looked up, and was astounded. Miss
                     Chester stood erect before me, her large eyes dilated, and her breast heaving
                     with anger and fear; and the red blood crimsoning her fair face, her fair neck,
                     into a deep blush.</p>
                  <p>"How dare you," said she, rapidly and angrily, "use such a power over me? This
                     is the third time that——. But you may understand that even if you have it, you
                     can never subject me to it. Did you not understand that the will of your
                     subject must be subdued, or surrendered? If I were not able and willing to defy
                     all you can do, I promise you I would have left you without a word. So often—in
                     my own home, too!"</p>
                  <p>In utter extremity of surprise, I too arose. She had spoken as if profoundly
                     convinced of some pernicious attempt designedly made by me; but what her
                     precise belief could be, I wondered, and had to answer nearly at random.</p>
                  <p>"Would you believe me," I asked, "under <emph>any</emph> sanction?"</p>
                  <p>She replied hesitatingly, "I don't know——"</p>
                  <p>"I swear to you," I said, "before God, that I never entertained the most
                     distant wish or purpose in respect to you, which could displease, or should
                     displease the proudest or noblest woman."</p>
                  <p>She stood yet hesitant in angry beauty. Even where truth is intellectually
                     believed, it is often not felt until some corroboratory circumstance be
                     furnished.</p>
                  <p>"You <emph>know</emph> it is so," I added, earnestly; "I know you saw how
                     unexpected your words were to me."</p>
                  <p>"I did;" she answered. "I saw it. I believe you. But it was natural, you know,
                     to be indignant."</p>
                  <p>"But I <emph>don't</emph> know, either," I replied. "There is something here
                     which I don't half understand, and you must let me talk with you about it. Let
                     me lead you to the sofa."</p>
                  <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7187-00000033"/>
                  <p>She sat down, and I sat unrebuked near her. "What do you mean," I continued,
                     "by speaking of the 'third time?'"</p>
                  <p>"You know," she answered, half suspiciously, as if thinking that I pretended
                     ignorance.</p>
                  <p>"I think I partly do; but I want to be certain."</p>
                  <p>"Don't you recollect," said Miss Chester, "that you treated me in the same way,
                     twice, the other evening; and before you had spoken to me, too?"</p>
                  <p>"I remember well," said I, "being twice surprised myself, by some one striking
                     me a severe blow, as I supposed. And I acknowledge that I looked much and often
                     at you. But, to-night, it must have been your anger, I think, that struck me.
                     At least, I saw that you were angry. I say struck. But it was not a blow. It
                     was something like a spasm; or, indeed, not that either; a sudden and powerful
                     repellent force exerted upon me, and operating, it seems to me, now that I
                     consider it, neither on my body nor my mind. But I don't understand it at all;
                     although I confess to you——. But tell me, please, what was the sensation that
                     you experienced? For it seems to me that you have been agitated much more than
                     I."</p>
                  <p>"You magnetized me," said she; "or tried to. Don't you know what that is?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes. I know what that is, perfectly well. I know that I have some power of
                     that kind. But I have never met with any phenomenon like these which seemed to
                     have occurred in respect to you, and certainly <emph>have</emph> appeared in
                     respect to myself. Please tell me plainly all about it. For there are, I think,
                     many things which I can learn from you; and I shall be right glad to
                     learn."</p>
                  <p>I spoke with two meanings; if, indeed, I needed any instruction in the
                     love-lesson which I was intuitively learning from my beautiful companion.
                     Whether she saw both of them I do not know. But she blushed as she
                     answered,</p>
                  <p>"I will tell you just what happened to me. You know what the sensation is which
                     indicates the coming of psycho-magnetic power from some person other than one's
                     self?"</p>
                  <p>"No, indeed," I replied; "that is, unless these three curious, sudden rebuffs,
                     if I might call them so, which I have felt lately, were such. In truth, I have
                     perhaps an unreasonably keen horror of coming under any such influence. I have
                     often thought, that if I should find any person 'magnetizing' me, I would kill
                     him, as surely as if it were necessary to prevent him from cutting my
                     throat."</p>
                  <p>"Yes. Then you can understand," said she; "how justifiably I was displeased
                     when I found you trying to magnetize me."</p>
                  <p>"Don't you believe me yet?" I asked. "I do most solemnly assure you that I had
                     not the remotest intention of the kind. If I did it, it was entirely and most
                     innocently involuntary."</p>
                  <p>"Do you mean to say," returned Miss Chester, now apparently much surprised, but
                     incredulously, "that you did not undertake to put my volition into a state of
                     subjection to your own, either this evening or the other?"</p>
                  <p>"Most assuredly I do," I answered. "Did I not tell you so before? I never used
                     any such power at all, except to relieve one feeble person from a
                     headache."</p>
                  <p>So speaking, I grew angry. For now, for the first time, I understood what was
                     the suspicion that Miss Chester entertained of me, viz.: that I had endeavored
                     to make myself master of her will, by taking advantage of her susceptible
                     nervous temperament So I myself now spoke further; and disdainfully and
                     wrathfully.</p>
                  <p>"And since you yet think that I proposed so vile and devilishly wicked a snare
                     as to rob a woman of the control<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7187-00000034"/> of
                     her own spirit, I do well to be angry. I will not even deny the base
                     accusation. Believe it if you can. And good-by to you. For I denied it, and
                     truly, before. Neither shall any one have the opportunity of disbelieving me
                     twice, if I can prevent it."</p>
                  <p>So I was departing in haste, and in bitter anger and disappointment—anger at
                     being so unworthily suspected—disappointment at the death of wild baseless
                     hopes, unjustified, and, truly, almost unborn.</p>
                  <p>But she saw then—her feminine instinct admonished her—that I spoke in most
                     entire truthfulness. And she recalled me, saying, "Don't go. I believe you now,
                     most fully. I did not understand you before, or I should have believed you
                     before."</p>
                  <p>And when, in my overpowering and deaf wrath, I strode unlistening into the
                     hall, and was departing in speed, like a true and kind friend, she stopped me.
                     For she stepped promptly between me and the door; and as I lifted my angry eyes
                     upon her, hardly seeing anything, indeed, through the turbid tumults of
                     unendurable passion that raged within me, she laid her fair hand upon my arm,
                     and detained me with gentle force. And she lifted her clear eyes to mine, and
                     looked upon me with such grieved and deep surprise, that I was abashed and
                     ashamed to appear before one so pure in such unlovely fury.</p>
                  <p>"You must not go away so angry. Come back. I will tell you a good reason for my
                     suspicion. You positively shall not go away so unjustly angry at me."</p>
                  <p>"Miss Chester," I replied, in shame as sudden as my wrath had been, "I will
                     stop, if you will promise to forgive my foolish passion."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, certainly." Then, seeing that I was disposed to reduplicate apologies,
                     she continued; "Don't say a word about it. We don't, either of us, I believe,
                     quite understand stand the other, yet. But when I have told you what I wish,
                     you may depart, if you will, either to return or not. I do not expect to retain
                     friends long."</p>
                  <p>She spoke sadly. Nor was her sadness needed to induce me to remain, for my own
                     displeasure was born of sorrow. So we sat down again.</p>
                  <p>"The reason of which I spoke," she said, "is simply this. I have before this
                     time narrowly escaped from one who sought to exercise over me the power which I
                     supposed you were seeding to use. I am sure I need not justify myself any
                     further?"</p>
                  <p>"No, indeed," I answered. "But why did you speak of not retaining friends for
                     any long time?"</p>
                  <p>"Because I never sought to. I cannot expect fuller measure of liking than such
                     as I have meted out to others."</p>
                  <p>I could not deny the justice of the retribution. I made no answer, and there
                     was a short pause. Then, recollecting a former part of our conversation, I
                     asked again for an account of her own sensations at the time when she had
                     supposed me attempting to bring her under a magnetic subjection to my will.</p>
                  <p>"I doubt very much," said she, "whether the words exist for describing it. For
                     several years I have read and talked much on this new philosophy of the mind
                     and soul; but all the terms are vague, transferred from former uses into the
                     present one; unsuitable, they fit like an empty crabshell to an oyster. So I
                     can hardly tell you what it is. It begins, however, with a sensation which I
                     can hardly describe, as I said, as to its precise nature—a general
                     consciousness of relations or sympathies offered or obtruded from outside of
                     one's own being; and this consciousness of mere relation proceeds and
                     intensifies and individualizes, until the threads or web of the medium of
                        connection<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7187-00000035"/> weave thicker and
                     thicker, and gather up into a cord passing directly to the person acting; and
                     then that person becomes recognised as so acting. I don't mean that there is
                     any actual cord, or material, or traceable road or way opened between the
                     parties. I use the expression as the best practicable mode of representing the
                     train of sensations. One thing more will finish all I can tell. You remember
                     that story of Heinrich Zschokke, in which the somnambulic lady recognises so
                     disgustfully the gross animalized character of the Italian prince, her
                     wooer?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes."</p>
                  <p>"The story is truthful there. There has always been, when I have felt the
                     sensations I describe, an almost immediate revelation of that kind. It has
                     seemed to me, though I must use words in the same vague representative sense
                     again, that those who approached me in that way were unhumanized into beasts.
                     Their personality seemed to change and degrade. Their souls departed. The force
                     of their life was a mere animal efflux, first imperceptibly alloying the stream
                     of influence which they rayed forth, but rapidly predominating until I was
                     inexpressibly shocked by the consciousness of the innate brutality of such
                     minds. I don't think I can state the experiences more intelligibly, though I
                     have spent much time in meditating on them. I almost doubt whether, in the
                     present state of scientific nomenclature and research, the conditions for the
                     classification of this department of knowledge exist."</p>
                  <p>Miss Chester ceased. "Allow me," said I, after a little thought, "to ask you a
                     supplementary question or two. Was it not the bestial grossness of the powers,
                     which you felt, which aroused in you the resisting horror of spasmodic
                     volition, which freed you at once from the vile influence?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes," she replied; "I feel sure that it was." Then I asked, once more, with
                     many doubts, and a most painful sinking of the heart, like that which assails a
                     rash leaper, who doubts for an instant, in mid air, whether he shall reach the
                     other side of the chasm—for I staked an unmeasurable hope or sorrow upon the
                     chance of the single question—almost desperately I asked, although I was
                     certain that I had looked and longed in pure freedom from any low desire—"Are
                     you sure that it was that same disagreeable surprise and disgust which caused
                     you to recalcitrate so violently against the influences which seem to have gone
                     from me to you?"</p>
                  <p>"I cannot be quite sure," returned Miss Chester. "I repel every approach of the
                     kind as soon as I can distinguish the individual making it. And I now undergo
                     so painful an agitation when I become aware that I am within such a sphere—such
                     a keen apprehension of dangerous neighborhood, and so quick an anger—that I no
                     longer stop to analyze the elements of whose operation I am conscious. But,"
                     she added, looking to the further side of the room, "I do most fully believe
                     that the thing happened without ill-intention on your part. Is not that
                     enough?"</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps so, if it is all you can say."</p>
                  <p>Then a thought occurred to me, that I would contrive to have this test applied;
                     for I cared for no risk. I would know, if I were unconsciously impure, that it
                     was so; and purify myself. I did not for a moment doubt the reliability of this
                     strange insight, and I continued—</p>
                  <p>"But I want leave to visit you again, and to read you one passage from a
                     favorite author of mine, which I am sure you will like. And, in return, I shall
                     ask you for some music."</p>
                  <p>"But I have not told you that I could play. You have<pb n="70-71"
                        xml:id="VAC7187-00000036"/> found it out by some queer method, I am sure.
                     What was it?"</p>
                  <p>"I observed, as you drummed upon the table, that you played triplets and thirds
                     with your left hand; and only a pianist or organist would do that."</p>
                  <p>"It is right," said she. "I will furnish such music as I can."</p>
                  <p>I was so bold as to ask her to set a time for my next visit, which she did; and
                     I was about departing, when she reminded me that our game of chess was yet
                     unfinished. I hastily assured her that my interest in that game had altogether
                     disappeared, when I had discovered the five-move mate; that I "resigned the
                     game," and challenged her to another, at the first convenient opportunity. And
                     so I departed.</p>

                  <p>NOW ought I to apologize for the unreflecting and imprudent manner in which I
                     had so suddenly become enamored? With one whom I had seen twice only; of whose
                     character, abilities, cultivation, I had had but the most transient
                     opportunities of judging? Perhaps so. The thoughts, however, which passed
                     through my mind while I sat in my quiet little room, and meditated upon Miss
                     Chester, my acquaintance with her, and its future, if any apology be needed or
                     admissible, must supply it. I reflected, therefore, somewhat as follows:—</p>
                  <p>Gloriously beautiful: <emph>That</emph> I can see—I, who am wont to be
                     fastidious, even to the implication of affectation. Physically strong and
                     healthy: The easy grace of motion, the pure complexion, the perfect outlines,
                     assure me of that. Intellectually, even my ideal—mine, the hypercritical, the
                     dreamer. For the scope of her thoughts, their direction and combination, even
                     in little things, were such as those in which I had specially and most lovingly
                     practised myself. Morally—how admirable to me—sickened with the lean
                     righteousness of business honor, the undistinguishable righteousness of
                     churches choking with worldly weeds, the utter non-righteousness of politicians
                     and editors inconceivably soulless, soaked and seasoned in foulest falsehood
                     until their original flavor, not in itself the most delicate, had disappeared
                     under the gross superimposition of "practical life"—to me, wearied and sickened
                     with such, how bright and noble her unrestrained, flashing sarcasm, her steady,
                     flaming anger, against little men! Was it not even superfluously demonstrated
                     that in reading, in study, in thought, word and work, we might be true and
                     helpful yokefellows? Desiring things noble and true, and working for them? And
                     that she would be truly a help—not in the assumption to herself of daily
                     drudgeries, and in details and the freeing me therefrom (for how pleasant to
                     shoulder my proper moiety of such burdens!); but in thinking with parallel and
                     coëqual vigor, in the same field of thought; in writing, talking, studying, the
                     same pursuit. What a limitless dream of true union and interfusion of
                     spirits!</p>
                  <p>But, a prudent elder might object, I didn't know it; I was merely
                     hypothetizing. That merely means that my methods of observing men and women, my
                     rules for managing my inductions, my synthesis and analysis, are at fault. But
                     as long as my experiments do not deceive me, I shall (<foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                        >mei enim unius vel maximè interest</foreign>) rely upon them, in preference
                     to the chilly vaticinations of an unfortunate senior, whose own faithlessness
                     has wrought its like, most probably in those with whom he dealt, and<pb
                        n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7187-00000037"/> so governed his opinions of them all.
                     Moreover, I was arrogant or wild enough to believe, within my secret soul, that
                     the instinctive delight, and the new and strange tumults antithetically stirred
                     within me by this troublous Irene, this war-arousing Peace, were alone premises
                     amply justificatory of my delicious conclusion. And it must and shall be so, if
                     indeed she will embark with me—I would chant to her, despite the cold old man,
                     as beseechingly as did the damsel to Thalaba the Destroyer:— <q>

                     assuming, and so in part, at least, shaping, the desired reply, shall I not
                     have it?</p>
                  <p>I think, yes.</p>
                  <p>Such meditations must suffice for apology. I sought out a curious old volume
                     which I had found at a bookstall—the only bibliographical treasure in my
                     possession. For it was from this book that I desired to read a passage to Miss
                     Chester—a quaint and musical chapter, hidden among the mystical musings of the
                     nameless old German author. Nameless, for title-page and colophon were both
                     gone, and my bibliographic lore did not suffice me to discover the writer.</p>
                  <p>What Miss Chester would say, or how she would receive the doctrine of the
                     coverless old book, I doubted. However, I went, at the appointed time, and
                     found her, as per agreement. I talked a few minutes, abstractedly and
                     unconnectedly, upon indifferent matters; but not, of course, with any
                     remarkable success. Then we spoke of Heinrich Zschokke, and his marvellous
                     power of imagination; of his story of the Sleep-walker; and suddenly I
                     remembered Miss Chester's former reference to Hortensia's recognition of the
                     vile nature of the Italian nobleman, and further, of her careful avoidance to
                     tell me whether she had actually recognised such in myself. And also, something
                     suggested to me to contrive, now, to know fully what she could discover on that
                     subject. Without pausing to reconsider, I spoke—</p>
                  <p>"Miss Chester, do you remember saying that you were entirely sure of your
                     ability to resist magnetic forces from other persons?"</p>
                  <p>"I am, at any rate; although I do not remember saying so. Why?"</p>
                  <p>"Because, I desire leave of you to test the justice of a suspicion which you
                     entertain of me."</p>
                  <p>"I don't understand. Test it how?"</p>
                  <p>"In this way:" and I hurried on with my request, lest my courage should fail
                     me, or lest any pause should admit a blank denial. "Let me dream of you as I
                     did before, at the times when you felt it; and permit the magnetic power to be
                     intensified as far as you dare allow. But, meanwhile, look keenly; and consider
                     closely, whether in me you observe the abominable degradation which I see that
                     you believe implied in the possession of the psychical authority. I would not
                     ask so, much of you, without a valid reason, either. I have the right, now, so
                     far as I can use it, without risk to you, to relieve myself from a suspicion
                     which I <emph>know</emph> is unfounded. I fell under it without intention or
                     wish. Do me the justice to allow me the only practicable chance of defence; in
                     which, moreover<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7187-00000038"/> over, the evidence is
                     to be submitted to the accuser, and the verdict to come from the same. I never
                     asked to rebut a suspicion before. But I never dreamed that I could fall under
                     such a one, or that it could be entertained of me by one so pure as you."</p>
                  <p>She sat, blushing, with eyes cast down; sighed; looked at me as if about to
                     speak; hesitated; looked away upon the floor; at last, spoke.</p>
                  <p>"I wish you would not insist; and, honestly, because I dread to have that which
                     I only suppose, now, changed into a wretched certainty. But if you do insist, I
                     think I ought to grant you the trial."</p>
                  <p>"I do, indeed," I answered. "For I <emph>know</emph> what I am."</p>
                  <p>"You must not ask me to look at you, however. That would originate a most
                     unpleasant self-consciousness. I will read, and you may exercise your privilege
                     without looking at my face."</p>
                  <p>She took up the old book I had brought, and opened it. I sat still, thinking of
                     myself, and of her. I knew that my soul was as pure as her own. I would
                     vindicate before her my unsullied honor. It should appear to her that there
                     might be another soul, not merely competent to consort with her own in light
                     accomplishments, in intellectual labor, in social pleasure, but able moreover
                     to ride as triumphantly as her own in the pure heaven of sunlighted and
                     tranquil contemplations, far above the clouded, dark, dirty region where most
                     thoughts are conversant—in such exercises and employments as are likest those
                     of the Almighty Soul, or as we innately believe likest—in pure love, and in the
                     wisdom accordant thereto. And my thoughts fled away, away; and deeper and
                     deeper, from within my soul arose the assertion of purity and honor unstained.
                     And I added a meditation; that the perfect being upon whom my contemplations
                     were so intensely concentred, should be my own; that my hemispheric life should
                     be rounded into full symmetry, by the conjunction therewith of the feminine
                     thoughts and powers, which, by virtue of my manhood, I could not have. Thus I
                     meditated, dreamed; without effort; without wish; for no such delightful trance
                     had ever enrapt me before. And so my conscious intellection quite departed; and
                     when I was recalled from my intuitional inner life—not now by a rude and angry
                     shock, as if struck upon the face by one insulted, but, awaked by a sudden
                     strong and clear exertion of independent will—and looked, in an overwhelming
                     dread, which <emph>would</emph> lower upon me, in spite of my efforts, towards
                     my companion, she sat with her face hidden between her two hands, turned from
                     me, bowed down upon the arm of the sofa, in an agony of passionate weeping.</p>
                  <p>I could not speak—I dared not speak. I apprehended all fatal things. It never
                     occurred to me to doubt the power of the psychical insight; and that its clear
                     light had shone upon some innermost debasement, of which I had been most
                     profoundly and innocently ignorant, I despairingly, believed. And that was the
                     worth of all my wisdom in self-measurement and self-estimation!</p>
                  <p>Miss Chester suddenly sat upright; drove away her emotion, at least from
                     outward manifestation; hastily dried her tears; threw back the hair which had
                     fallen in heavy bands and curls over her face; turned her eyes straight and
                     steadily to my own; and said, blushingly, but firmly, "I most fully believe you
                     to be, and to have been, utterly pure and noble."</p>
                  <p>"Pure, in truth; "I answered. "Noble in aspiration, if not in accomplishment.
                     And I would thank you, if thanks were due, for justice done."</p>
                  <p>She made no answer—apparently lost in some recollection<pb n="76-77"
                        xml:id="VAC7187-00000039"/> tion. Nor could I desire to speak; for I exulted
                     in silent joy at the recognition of the truth and honor which I had felt that I
                     might fairly claim. The silence was prolonged almost to awkwardness, when the
                     open piano caught my eye, and I said—</p>
                  <p>"You promised me some music, Miss Chester. Will you please play?"</p>
                  <p>She arose, and crossing to the instrument, sat down. Then she asked—</p>
                  <p>"What music do you prefer?"</p>
                  <p>"Music? If you will play me such as you like, I will promise to like it."</p>
                  <p>"That is too complimentary. I want the music to please you in itself."</p>
                  <p>"I did not mean a compliment. But does it displease you that I feel certain
                     that I should of myself choose such music as you would, and therefore that I
                     may trust you to choose for me?"</p>
                  <p>She asked, without direct answer, and without looking at me—"Did you ever
                     compose any music?"</p>
                  <p>"Only in one way. Sometimes beautiful words have made themselves a melody for
                     me, while I have been thinking them over, and I have written it, and played or
                     sung it."</p>
                  <p>She made no reply, but played a nocturn. It was intricate and monotonous, I
                     thought. But was sad; and threw me into mournful thought. And I distinguished
                     something veiled within, as it were; a soul of hidden meaning, within the
                     exterior sounds; whose existence, however, was only suggested to me at the
                     repeat at the last strain but one, and in the last strain. As the full chords
                     of the last cadence died into silence, I said, almost unconsciously—</p>
                  <p>"I wish I might hear that again."</p>
                  <p>She played it again. And that second rendering astonished me. The music was the
                     same, yet not the same. I could distinguish the same ideas and strains which I
                     had heard before. But the cadences and mournful singing of the quiet measures
                     took on, now, a new and startling significance.</p>
                  <p>The composition was entirely new to me. As I said, it had, at first, been
                     simply a quiet and monotonous performance, difficult of execution; and not
                     until near the end, as my ear began to interpret the singularly repetitious
                     concatenations of the successive strains, did I catch a glimpse of
                        <emph>any</emph> meaning; and even that had nearly escaped me. At the second
                     hearing, however, I saw, if I may so speak, more clearly. The involved and
                     almost superfluous instrumentation, the full and sustained harmonies, seemed to
                     have been thrown around, as shadowing veils and draperies, to hide the import
                     of the thread of melody; or to conceal it from all but the closest observation.
                     And thus it came to me; flashing or streaming up; or sounding faintly and
                     dimly; struggling from underneath the enveloping weight of the great volumes of
                     sound; scarcely seen; as one might gaze down into a dark ravine, through
                     boiling mountain mists, and here and there catch a glimpse of men, dimly
                     distinguished, passing upon an unknown errand. In such a way I gradually became
                     aware of the meaning of the singular combinations which were presented before
                     me. But now, moreover, I began to be conscious of a strange, and yet of an
                     uncommonly clearly indicated significance in the music; although it is perhaps
                     a question liable to doubt, how much of this apparent tangibility of meaning is
                     due to the general or contemporaneous condition or tendencies of my thoughts,
                     and how much to the conceptions and executive success of the composer. But, at
                     first faintly, as from an infinite<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7187-00000040"/>
                     distance, through darkness and clouds, sorrowful utterances were spoken;
                     wailings of some one alone, fearful, rising now and then into loud sobs and
                     clamorous cries of mercy. They grew more and more articulate; in melancholy
                     distinctness they now resounded clearly above the clinging enwrapments of the
                     full accompaniment. So clear was the representation that, as the wailing
                     strains cried out to me, my eyes involuntarily filled with tears. But the
                     lamentations and the lonely crying faded away. Then, muffled and dimly as
                     before, came another strain—a lovely and sweet-flowing; strain, singing first
                     from afar and then from nearer, comfort and hope. The wailing cry recommenced,
                     as if the unhappy one sought consolation from the singer; and the sorrow and
                     the joy for a time were chanted together. But the sad subordination of the
                     mourner was modulated, ere long, by a magical representation of the same
                     musical idea, but a sad one no longer, into a happy and harmonious sympathy
                     with the loftier joy; and the whole drama was auspiciously concluded by the
                     triumphant beauty of more unconcealed gladness which had first struck me in the
                     latter part of the composition. It sang and rejoiced exceedingly; though still
                     in the strangely restrained and hidden undercurrent in which the whole air was
                     interpreted; in lovely and happy melody—the still, bright happiness of perfect
                     content.</p>
                  <p>The instrument was still. The lovely musician, too, sat motionless, but
                     evidently in the keen excitement of an artist; with eyes cast down, and cheeks
                     flushed; even, I fancied, refraining from tears, only by a strong effort.</p>
                  <p>Neither of us thought of more music. We returned to our former seats.</p>
                  <p>I entertained a curious hope about the music. "Miss Chester," said I, "did you
                     compose that music?"</p>
                  <p>She answered; with confusion, however, and evident hesitation, "Yes."</p>
                  <p>"Have you ever played it to others than me?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes. Two or three times."</p>
                  <p>"Did any one ever ask you to repeat it?"</p>
                  <p>"No."</p>
                  <p>"And was there a meaning in the music?"</p>
                  <p>She answered almost inaudibly, "Yes."</p>
                  <p>"I thought so," said I, "and I have discovered it. It meant sorrow; loneliness;
                     longing; then satisfaction and joy. Did it not?"</p>
                  <p>Of that I was quite sure. And I was, besides, so arrogant as to hope that she
                     meant more than that; that <emph>that</emph> was a nothing—dross—mere miserable
                     husks—to the delicious confession—the sweetest of all revelations—which I hoped
                     I had heard. For I dared to think that she had spoken her longings to me in the
                     music, as to one haply able to supply the desire of her heart—to drive the
                     sorrow and the loneliness far away—that she had revealed her soul to me in that
                     sweet and safe unspoken way, trusting that if I were indeed such an one as she
                     desired, I should understand, the hieroglyph—the sacred hidden speech. This was
                     the tumultuously joyful hope that illuminated and disturbed my mind; that
                     unsteadied my hand; that made me tremble; that almost deprived me of the
                     command of my voice. But still, with an ulterior design—for yet there was a
                     possibility that I might by error be preparing an overwhelming disappointment—I
                     had hidden all that part of my interpretation of the music for which I cared,
                     and assumed, perhaps at the risk of appearing conceited, the completeness of
                     the general translation which I gave in words.</p>
                  <p>With sudden coolness—more delightful to me than a satisfied tone could have
                     been, for I interpreted it to mean<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7187-00000041"/>
                     disappointment at the shallow reading, and mortification at the gratuitous and
                     uncomprehended expenditure of emotion, Miss Chester answered—</p>
                  <p>"You are right. But there was more; which, however, I suppose you could not be
                     expelled to understand."</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps not," I answered, with as much indifference as I could command, seeing
                     that her answer corroborated my suspicion. "But I am exceedingly obliged to you
                     for the music; and more, for displaying to me what you do not grant to many—the
                     result of your own thoughts, and the workings of your own soul."</p>
                  <p>"Have I?" she asked with a sudden bitterness.</p>
                  <p>"Yes; you have. But I was to read you a passage from an old book, bearing upon
                     the psychological matters of which you and I have some experience. Shall
                     I?"</p>
                  <p>"If you please," she said coldly, and with evident disinclination to
                     listen.</p>
                  <p>"I will," I replied. "And I had liefer read it now, than before the beautiful
                     music, or before I came here this evening."</p>
                  <p>Then I took the book, and read from <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Cap.
                        Tertium,</foreign> commencing with the second paragraph; rendering the old
                     German into partly correspondent English, as follows:</p>
                  <p>"Now shall I show how there is included in the major or principal sympathy
                     which worketh from Our Lord to his creatures, and returneth back from them to
                     him—whether such creatures possess the life of the stone only, or that and the
                     life of the tree, or those and the life of the beast, or the life of the man,
                     which is the synthesis of the three with the Love and Wisdom of Our Lord
                     therein infused—the sympathy <foreign xml:lang="LAT">in singulis.</foreign>
                  </p>
                  <p>"For this sympathy, namely, the major, is such as that in it we all, who are
                     human, are one; since only by virtue of intimate oneness could interchange and
                     increase of life be permitted; therefore we, our fathers, and those who shall
                     follow us, are, except for the extenuation of Time, one and the same being.</p>
                  <p>"And sith it be so, we may now the readier comprehend the case of such who are
                     drawn together by an unisonous nature, being, in course of accident, put each
                     within the sphere and influence of the other. But first I would discuss the
                     reasons why not all are so drawn in love to consonance of society and unity of
                     thought and will. This is like that case of the unfriendly rivers, whereof the
                     pure, in horror of the other's turbid flow, refused mingling; and ran a far way
                     to the sea, apart by itself, upon a line drawn between. For in such wise is it
                     that pure minds are wont to withdraw, and not to have converse with the common,
                     the maculated souls by sin, by folly and by worldliness; so as that they do
                     harbor all alone, and thereby do oft-times miss of meetings which might befall
                     to them mingling in the crowds. And likewise, the imperfection which sin has
                     seated so deeply in men doth cause imperfection of body and of mind,
                     contrariously to the will of the imperfect; and that imperfection, meeting
                     another imperfection, may not consent therewith, and consent and union may not
                     be; no more than oil may mingle With water, though both be of no mean nature in
                     themselves, because they be differently directed. And moreover, the perfectness
                     of this union can by no means be, except between a man and a woman; for they be
                     so by Our Lord made, alike yet differing, as that the strength and wisdom of
                     the one may counterbalance the weakness of the other, and the loving and
                     intuitions of her nature may fill many offices which the man cannot do. For no
                     one nature, less than Our Lord's, is perfect. And the two things which be most
                     extreme in contradiction one of another; and thus the quiet and loving woman
                     and the strong and bold man;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7187-00000042"/> do in
                     their synthesis and unity arise into truth and perfection, such as our humanity
                     may attain, before we arise into the heaven of Our Lord.</p>
                  <p>"And thus it is, that the noble Love of perfect union is rare; since to it
                     there go many conditions preliminary and needful; and also many there be which
                     I do not here enumerate; treating them in full in another place; and moreover,
                     untrue torsions and perversions from the training and governance suffered in
                     youth, do discourage and weaken the Inner Truth; insomuch that where such
                     persons may perchance be cognizant each of the other, the woman saith nothing,
                     since she believeth, by her instructions had, that love and a perceived union
                     should ever be quite concealed, and not by any means intimated to any; and she
                     doth no longer clearly see the light of that Truth which would advise to the
                     speedy signification of the recognised wish. Nor doth the man speak, for he is
                     by the false humility taught by his governors inured to hide his goodness in
                     silence; for poverty; or for small learning; or for some empty crust or ghost
                     of accident; insomuch that he repels and silences the Inner Truth which would
                     fain speak to the woman.</p>
                  <p>"But seldom therefore doth it fall out that such are revealed to one another by
                     the speech of the inner voice; and they be by that voice known one to another,
                     having articulated naught; and if only they be such, by fortune of their life
                     and experience, that they have lived in the freedom of the thoughtful; and if
                     haply they do speak, and their spoken minds do harmonize in that outer
                     manifestation of the true life hidden beneath the threefolded veil of the body,
                     the mind, and the will, then sad and miserable is their after-lot if they shall
                     then depart either from the other. For having let go the unity and beauty in
                     living, which is the fortune of few, and which Our Lord thus presents ready at
                     their hand, right is it that they should not fro-wardly prevail to have the
                     precious jewels of Our Lord submitted as vile wares to the unsteady choice of
                     their careless hesitation and tardy folly. And not twice within the small life
                     of man is that to happen; nor, truly, oftener than once in the lives of
                     millions of men."</p>
                  <p>I laid the book away in silence. I dared not look at Miss Chester. I had spoken
                     more clearly than the music. I had shot my bolt, but I dared not, for the
                     moment, question whether the mark was hit. Yet the misery of the suspense
                     forthwith arose over the hesitation; I looked; but she sat motionless, looking
                     down. I could not bear to wait, or to leave anything longer indefinite.</p>
                  <p>"Irene," I said—</p>
                  <p>She started, but did not answer, nor look up.</p>
                  <p>"Irene, the old man from whom. I read, spoke for me; and what he says is true.
                     I desire to confess to you that I hid part of the truth, in interpreting the
                     music to you, so that I might answer what I believed it said, in the same
                     hidden way. But my interpretation was bolder and deeper than I said. If I
                     understood the music, you will not be vexed that I am so free to call you
                     Irene."</p>
                  <p>She did not move or speak. I dared to take her hand. It resisted not; but as I
                     touched her, she trembled and sighed.</p>
                  <p>"Irene, if I understood the voice of the music, I may hold your hand in mine.
                     But will you not raise your eyes to mine?"</p>
                  <p>She did. And the sad beauty of her deep eyes, for they swam in springing tears,
                     and there were traces of tears upon her flushed cheeks, brought tears into my
                     own. Sadly and steadily, but as if with intensest effort, she gazed.</p>
                  <p>"Irene—my Irene—if I understood the voices of the<pb n="84-85"
                        xml:id="VAC7187-00000043"/> music, I may love you; and you will love me—and
                     be my Irene—my Peace—my life-long peace."</p>
                  <p>Still she answered not; but her tears overflowed now.</p>
                  <p>"You will not deny me, Irene, will you?" I drew her towards me and kissed her.
                     She did not endeavor to prevent it. She returned the kiss.</p>
                  <p>And though she did afterwards withdraw herself from within my arms, and gently
                     insisted that I must go, for that time, offering me the farewell kiss, of her
                     own accord; and though we have been often out of each other's sight, my
                     Irene—my beloved wife—and I have never been parted since.</p>

                  <head>TRYING IT ON.</head>
                  <p>"PSHAW! this will never do, Madame Larami!"</p>
                  <p>"But madam!"—</p>
                  <p>"You will have to alter it altogether. It's wretchedly made."</p>
                  <p>"I'm sorry"—began madame in a soft silky voice, which seemed to have taken its
                     texture from the glossy fabrics she dealt in, while a black shadow, almost a
                     frown, flitted across her sallow features, unseen by Mrs. Macsimum, and
                     contradicted her tone of gentle sorrow.</p>
                  <p>"Oh! bother!" continued Mrs. Macsimum, giving her shoulders that wriggle
                     peculiar to ladies who are in the act of trying on a new dress; "did any one
                     ever see such a body? why the thing is completely spoiled—'tis really too bad;"
                     and she gave the apricot silk an impatient tug just where it very imperfectly
                     pretended to conceal her bust.</p>
                  <p>"I am very sorry indeed, Mrs. Macsimum, that the dress doesn't please you,"
                     said Madame Larami, the black shadow on her face growing more and more like a
                     cloud; "but I can assure you we took particular pains with that dress, and if I
                     may be allowed an opinion, I think, ma'am, that you are mistaken about its not
                     fitting you."</p>
                  <p>"The body isn't half low enough," answered Mrs. Macsimum, pettishly; "don't you
                     see that? I'm not going to cover myself up like an old maid, Madame
                     Larami!"</p>
                  <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7187-00000044"/>
                  <p>"We can have that remedied in an hour if you wish it, said madame, with her
                     face shot with black like a half mourning silk; "but look at that skirt, ma'am.
                     I'm sure nothing could hang better."</p>
                  <p>"Oh! the skirt is well enough, Larami," said the lady endeavoring to get a back
                     view of the dress in a Psyche glass, by twisting her head over her shoulder,
                     "and those black lace flounces look very well—but, Larami, are they real
                     Valenciennes?"</p>
                  <p>"I have charged them as such in the bill, madam, and I never commit frauds on
                     my customers."</p>
                  <p>"Oh! I didn't mean that, Larami," answered Mrs. Macsimum, rather hurriedly, for
                     Madame Larami's offended dignity at this instant was appalling—"but you know
                     that everything is mock nowadays, and you might be deceived as well as
                     another."</p>
                  <p>"I'm never deceived, Mrs. Macsimum; we, poor milliners, have to be very
                     cautious."</p>
                  <p>"I've no doubt—I've no doubt, Larami," said Mrs. Macsimum, impatiently.</p>
                  <p>"There was Mrs. Crissalis, the other day, ma'am—I was very near losing a
                     thousand dollars by her, when Mr. Crissalis failed. But I was cautious, Mrs.
                     Macsimum, and I have my little ways of knowing, so I sent in my little account
                     a few days before the gentleman went, ma'am."</p>
                  <p>"Very prudent of you, Larami," said Mrs. Macsimum, with a sickly attempt at a
                     smile. "A shocking thing, that failure of Mr. Crissalis. I pity his wife
                     greatly, poor woman. By the way, have you brought that Indian scarf with
                     you?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, ma'am," said the dressmaker, unfolding one of those wondrous combinations
                     of fine texture and brilliancy of color which the East alone is able to
                     produce.</p>
                  <p>"It is a lovely scarf, certainly," exclaimed the lady, flinging it over her
                     shoulders—" and goes admirably with this dress. I shall take it, madame."</p>
                  <p>Madame Larami bowed.</p>
                  <p>"Now, madame," went on Mrs. Macsimum, "remember you must be punctual with this
                     dress. The alterations must be done and the dress here by eight o'clock."</p>
                  <p>"It shall be here, ma'am, to the moment."</p>
                  <p>"You see I shall have to be dressed early, in order that I may see to the
                     flowers, and give a few directions about the supper-table. That's the worst of
                     being obliged to go to one's own balls."</p>
                  <p>Madame Larami endeavored to appear penetrated with sympathy.</p>
                  <p>"Now, Larami, you can take these things off, for I expect Cremolino here every
                     moment to dress my hair."</p>
                  <p>Madame Larami, obedient to the hint, immediately proceeded to divest Mrs.
                     Macsimum of the elegant but expensive dress about which she was so fastidious,
                     and in a few moments that lady was once more reclining in a vast easy-chair,
                     with her fine though somewhat large figure dimly outlined through the soft
                     folds of her peignoir.</p>
                  <p>The apartment in which she sat was the type of modern luxury, subdued by a
                     certain refinement of taste, which Mrs. Macsimum had caught up in spite of
                     herself during a long residence in Paris. It was a boudoir, to which a coved
                     ceiling gave an air of loftiness almost disproportioned to its area. The walls
                     were painted with warm but subdued coloring. A faint pink staining in the glass
                     of the windows filled the room with a rosy light, so much so that middle-aged
                     ladies who visited Mrs. Macsimum, and young ones who had left their complexions
                     at the last ball, loved that little boudoir and its becoming tints.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Macsimum's toilette-tables—for she had more than one—revealed a system of
                     personal culture of the most<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7187-00000045"/> elaborate
                     nature. The secrets of artificial beauty of every nation under the sun seemed
                     to have found their way to Mrs. Macsimum. Turkish cosmetics for darkening the
                     eyes, and reddening the finger-tips. French mysteries, by which the palest
                     cheeks and bluest lips could be made to bloom once more with the rich tints of
                     health. Wonderful yellow paper-books with what seemed to be green leaves thrust
                     between the pages, which green leaves, when rubbed on the cheek, by some
                     chemical magic, would be found to leave a pink trace. Boxes of subtle powders,
                     sovereign for giving the skin what the French call a <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >velouté</foreign> appearance. Bandolines, on the production of which the
                     greatest chemists of the age had lavished years of labor. Pieces of
                     pumice-stone, set in mother-of-pearl handles, and useful for reducing a
                     roughened hand to a satin smoothness; all these things flanked, and surrounded,
                     and mixed up with a gleaming and variegated array' of Bohemian glass <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">flaçons, vinaigrettes,</foreign> bouquet-holders, ivory
                     brushes, gold and silver dressing-apparatus, crystal and agate cups, filled
                     with fanciful trinkets, over all of which a thousand delicious odors floated in
                     a mingling vapor, as if the rosy flasks and veined vases were really perfumed
                     like the flowers whose hues they copied—all this, I say, formed a <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">coup d'œil,</foreign> the first impression of which would be,
                     that the majestic-looking woman who reclined so lazily in the crimson fauteuil,
                     was indeed a modern Namouna, surrounded by the spells with which she conquered
                     time and age.</p>
                  <p>The apricot dress was once more carefully folded and laid in a basket,
                     delicately covered with oiled silk, which a negro boy bore behind the
                     fashionable milliner, when she walked abroad on business. Mrs. Macsimum had
                     resigned herself to the contemplation of the Indian scarf, which she was idly
                     flinging in different folds over the back of a French chair near her, when
                     Madame Larami, having disposed her black silk <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >visite</foreign> coquettishly across her shoulders, stopped just before
                     Mrs. Macsimum, and drew a letter from her pocket. At this hour of the day, that
                     lady always possessed the ability to blush. The steadfast color which glowed on
                     her cheeks of evenings was not yet applied, and on this occasion, the blood
                     rushed to her pale face in a torrent, as the milliner drew forth the note.</p>
                  <p>"Your bill, I suppose, Larami," said she with a faint smile, holding out her
                     hand for it. "Mr. Macsimum is not going to fail, I hope?"</p>
                  <p>"O! ma'am, I couldn't think of such a thing," replied Larami, with a dark
                     smile. "It's not my bill, ma'am, but a note that a—a gentleman asked me to give
                     to you."</p>
                  <p>"A note for me, from a gentleman! let me see;" and as she took it, an
                     expression of wonderful relief spread itself over her countenance.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, ma'am—Mr. Sillery Payne begged of me to deliver it to you when you were
                     alone."</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Sillery Payne!" cried Mrs. Macsimum, opening the note with rather an
                     agitated hand, while at the same time a smile of gratified, something or
                     other—perhaps vanity—dawned in her large blue eyes. "How imprudent!" she
                     murmured to herself, as she read the contents of the scented paper. "How
                     impertinent!" she exclaimed aloud, for the benefit of Madame Larami. "You can
                     tell Mr. Payne that you have delivered his note, Larami," she continued,
                     tossing it carelessly into an Indian basket half full of notes of invitation,
                     bills, and little gilt dancing lists, "and mention to him, that when I see him
                     this evening, I will give him the information he desires."</p>
                  <p>"I shall do so, madam," said Larami, drawing another elegant-looking inclosure
                     from her abundant pocket. "I<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7187-00000046"/> hope,
                     Mrs. Macsimum," she continued, always smiling that sallow smile of hers, "I
                     hope that you will not think me intrusive if I submit this little account to
                     your inspection," and so saying, she gently insinuated the note towards her
                     customer.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Macsimum lost in an instant that delicate smile of triumph which the
                     perusal of Mr. Sillery Payne's communication had awakened. She cast a rapid and
                     suspicious glance at madame, and jerked the refined-looking bill from her
                     hand.</p>
                  <p>"Do you want any money immediately, Larami?" she asked in a would-be careless
                     tone, but in which a certain half-concealed eagerness could be easily
                     detected.</p>
                  <p>"Well, ma'am, to tell you the truth, I am very much pressed just now. My rent
                     falls due to-morrow, and I have to meet a note of mine, which Mr. Lustring, the
                     silk mercer, holds, at twelve o'clock on the same day. Not to inconvenience
                     you, however, ma'am, I will manage with half the account now."</p>
                  <p>"Let us see," said Mrs. Macsimum, extracting from its envelope the sheet of
                     satin paper, in which all her elegant follies were truthfully chronicled. "Good
                     heavens! Larami!" she exclaimed, starting and turning still more pale. "How on
                     earth do you make it out so much? Three thousand five hundred and twenty-five
                     dollars!"</p>
                  <p>"I think you'll find it quite correct, madam. The fancy dress for Mrs. Hornet's
                     ball was very expensive, and that green Persian scarf cost eight hundred
                     dollars in the country. I shall be quite willing to have you examine all the
                     items, Mrs. Macsimum. I don't think you will find any overcharges."</p>
                  <p>"Oh! I suppose not—I suppose not, Larami. But still it's a very large
                     amount."</p>
                  <p>"It's been running a long time, madam."</p>
                  <p>"But I paid you considerable sums at various times."</p>
                  <p>"I have given you credit for all payments, ma'am."</p>
                  <p>"I'm afraid, Larami," and Mrs. Macsimum assumed a charming smile which seemed
                     to convey, that it would be cruelty to press so enchanting a woman for a paltry
                     sum of money; "I am very much afraid that my bank account will not admit of my
                     letting you have what you want, and I can't ask Mr. Macsimum, you know."</p>
                  <p>"Very sorry, indeed, ma'am, to press a lady, but I cannot possibly do without
                     the money."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, nonsense, Larami," said Mrs. Macsimum, with a reckless air, "you must try.
                     In the course of a week or so, I may be able, but just at the present I really
                     cannot."</p>
                  <p>Madame Larami summoned her negro, and deposited the precious basket in his
                     sooty hands; gave her black silk mantilla another twist before the glass, and
                     making a profound courtesy to Mrs. Macsimum ere she left the room, said in her
                     low silky voice—</p>
                  <p>"I will call with the dress this evening, myself, Mrs. Macsimum, and get the
                     money."</p>
                  <p>"Madame Larami!"——cried Mrs. Macsimum, with an indignant flush at the cool,
                     determined tone of the milliner; but ere she could utter her displeasure, a
                     gentleman pushed madame aside, closed the door in her face, and flung himself
                     into the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">fauteuil</foreign> that Mrs. Macsimum had just
                     quitted.</p>
                  <p>"Well, Mrs. Macsimum," cried this last visitor, passing his hands briskly
                     through his short stubby hair, "well, it's all up with us, we shall be
                     protested to-morrow."</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Macsimum! what under heaven do you mean?" cried his wife, growing, if
                     possible, paler than ever. "You surely don't mean to say that——"</p>
                  <p>"Precisely. The firm of Macsimum &amp; Bullrush will smash to-morrow."</p>
                  <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7187-00000047"/>
                  <p>"Good God!" exclaimed the lady, sinking into a chair, "what intelligence this
                     is to bring to me! And how coolly you seem to take it, as if you alone were to
                     suffer! Are you not ashamed of yourself, Mr. Macsimum, to go and fail in this
                     way? What am I to do, I should like to know?"</p>
                  <p>"The best you can, my dear," answered Mr. Macsimum, calmly. "My character,
                     thank God, will remain unstained. I have surrendered everything."</p>
                  <p>"You have, have you?" almost shrieked the lady. "You're an idiot, Mr. Macsimum!
                     What was your character to me, I should like to know, that you leave me to
                     starve in order that you might preserve it? Your character isn't good to eat or
                     to wear; your character won't pay house-rent, or buy a box at the opera. I am
                     sure, Mr. Macsimum, if I had known that such treatment was in store for me, it
                     would have been long before I would have become your wife."</p>
                  <p>"Too late to regret that now, my dear."</p>
                  <p>"It's all your own fault, sir; our recklessness and extravagance knew no
                     bounds."</p>
                  <p>"I think, Mrs. Macsimum," answered the gentleman, looking round the room with a
                     sarcastic twinkle in his clear gray eye, "if I have been extravagant, you have
                     kept me in countenance."</p>
                  <p>"Oh! yes. Say it's me! That's the usual answer. <emph>I</emph> spend
                     everything! The smallest necessary of life that I purchase, is immediately
                     magnified by you into a useless luxury. Perhaps you'd like me to go without
                     shoes, Mr. Macsimum? I might save you a little money in that way."</p>
                  <p>"Chut! chut! Mrs. Macsimum, let us have no quarrelling. This misfortune cannot
                     be helped. It is one of the chances of trade, and we must bear it. To-morrow,
                     at twelve o'clock, our paper will be protested, and all the street will know it
                     Until then, let us put the best face on matters; and at this ball to night, be
                     careful not to betray yourself. For there is always a chance of retrieving as
                     long as the affair is secret."</p>
                  <p>"I could cry if it were not for this ball," said Mrs. Macsimum, with an
                     intonation and compression of the lips that would seem rather to indicate that
                     she could scratch. But a servant announcing the arrival of Cremollino the
                     hair-dresser, she controlled her feelings. Her husband was excluded, and in a
                     few moments a pair of fat Italian hands were twisting and crisping her hair
                     into the intricate labyrinths prescribed by fashion.</p>
                  <p>"Larami must have had some intelligence of this," murmured Mrs. Macsimum; "or
                     she would never have been so insolent."</p>

                  <head>TEMPTATION.</head>
                  <p>THE earliest guest that was whistled in that evening, through Mrs. Macsimum's
                     magnificent portals in Fifth Avenue, was Mr. Sillery Payne.</p>
                  <p>"Be civil to him, my dear," whispered Mr. Macsimum to his wife, as he heard the
                     name announced, "he is one of our chief creditors."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Sillery Payne was a New York celebrity. Rich, travelled, sufficiently
                     handsome, with a low, sweet voice, and a hand and foot of marvellous smallness.
                     He had gone through all the phases of an American who had been born wealthy.
                     Had gambled, gone abroad, fought a duel in Paris, got imprisoned in Austria,
                     "presented" in London, and finally returned with an accomplished Italian valet,
                     and an astounding reputation for <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bonnes

                  <p>In a few moments after his arrival, he was seen gliding up the spacious
                     drawing-room to the small boudoir in which Mrs. Macsimum received, and where
                     she sat in all the glory of the apricot silk and Indian scarf, with an uneasy
                     smile fastened as it were on her lips, and the unreal bloom of rouge reddenihg
                     her cheeks.</p>
                  <p>"I got your message. Thanks!" whispered Mr. Sillery Payne, sandwiching the
                     sentence between a couple of audible compliments. "How charmingly your rooms
                     look to-night, Mrs. Macsimum!"</p>
                  <p>"The flowers are pretty, I think," replied the lady, assuming a pretty air of
                     total unconsciousness of the whisper.</p>
                  <p>"They would be if their queen were not present," said Mr. Sillery Payne, with
                     so <foreign xml:lang="FRA">dévoué</foreign> an air that the stupid commonplace
                     was immediately elevated into a compliment.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Payne, I forbid compliments for this evening, and shall banish all who
                     trangress the edict," and a juvenile threatening with her fan accompanied Mrs.
                     Macsimum's prohibition.</p>
                  <p>"The sun might as well compel the flower to remain closed in daytime.
                     Compliments are the incense which the divinity of beauty forces from us."</p>
                  <p>"You have disobeyed my edict. You know the punishment. Go!"</p>
                  <p>"Well, as I see a whole tribe of invited ones flocking into pay their
                     compliments to you, I will accept my exile with a good grace. For I would
                     rather be away from you altogether, than be in your presence and not be able to
                     talk to you without restraint."</p>
                  <p>"Flatterer, get thee behind me!"</p>
                  <p>"Meet me in an hour in the winter garden;" and without waiting for an answer,
                     Mr. Sillery Payne with a careless less bow turned upon his heel and sauntered
                     off to quiz the ugly Miss Rhinebeck who was occupying a huge sofa in profound
                     solitude.</p>
                  <p>"By the way," said Mr. Sillery Payne, as, an hour afterwards, he and Mrs.
                     Macsimum were slowly walking arm in arm in the huge winter garden that opened
                     into the ball-room; "by the way, I see my friend Madame Larami sitting in the
                     hall. What part is she to play in the night's entertainments?"</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Macsimum bit her lips. This had been what she dreaded all the evening.
                     Larami had vowed not to quit the house until Mrs. Macsimum had given her the
                     sum she required, and was sitting patiently in the hall waiting until some one
                     interrogated her, when it was as likely as not that she would burst out with an
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">exposé</foreign> of the entire business. Mrs.
                     Macsimum, however, summoned up courage, and replied in an off-hand manner:</p>
                  <p>"Oh! I suppose the good creature is studying her profession. I believe she
                     asked leave to sit in the hall and watch the ladies' dresses."</p>
                  <p>"Hem! Mrs. Macsimum, there isn't a word of truth in that, and you know it."</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Payne, you are too insolent, sir. Let us return."</p>
                  <p>"Now, my dear Mrs. Macsimum, do not too readily take offence at my bluntness. I
                     wish sincerely to be your friend. I would make any sacrifice, no matter what,
                     if it was to obtain your happiness. Why not then confide in me? I know that you
                     need a friend into whose ear you can pour all your troubles and your joys. Let
                     me be that friend."</p>
                  <p>"Really, Mr. Payne, I don't know what to think; this offer is so strange—yet if
                     it were sincere, I think——"</p>
                  <p>"It is, it is, sincere! You know not, you can never know, how I have yearned
                     for this hour. With what<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7187-00000049"/> crazed
                     longings I have waited for the chance that was to enable me to assume the
                     hallowed position of your friend. It may seem cruel, but I cannot help feeling
                     rejoiced at this little annoyance of yours, since it gives me the opportunity
                     of hastening to your assistance. It is the selfishness of love!"</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Payne, I must not listen to this. My husband——"</p>
                  <p>"Your husband! Excuse me, dear Mrs. Macsimum; but do you think that your
                     husband is capable of understanding you? Can he comprehend that sublime, yet
                     tender nature, in which a living well of affection is inclosed, and which
                     requires only the touch of the inspired hand to flow out in a glorious stream?
                     Oh! no, dear friend. His nature is one that can never match with yours!"</p>
                  <p>This bombast, uttered, as it was, in the most melodious of voices, and
                     accompanied by pressures of the hand and tender and eloquent glances, seemed to
                     Mrs. Macsimum,—whose judgment in such matters was regulated by Indiana and the
                     Mysteries of Paris—the very acme of impassioned pleading. In spite of the old
                     theory of boarding-school misses, women of thirty are far more apt to be
                     carried away by a bit of romance than the bread-and-butterest of young girls.
                     It is their last chance, and they make the most of it. Mrs. Macsimum,
                     therefore, could not long resist such flattering eloquence, and soon bestowed
                     on Mr. Sillery Payne that confidence for which, according to his own account,
                     he would sacrifice so much. She told him how this bill of Larami's was hanging
                     like the sword of Damocles over her head. How that pertinacious milliner was
                     determined to have the money or expose her; and how she dared not ask her
                     husband for so large an amount, because—because (here she stammered a little)
                     he had been so very liberal to her lately."</p>
                  <p>"Now, my clear Aurelia," said Mr. Sillery Payne, taking her hand at the same
                     moment that he assumed the prerogative of calling her by her first name; "my
                     dear Aurelia, there is one little fact connected with this business which you
                     have omitted to mention. I do not, however, need any information on the
                     subject. I am in full possession of all the particulars. Mr. Macsimum's paper
                     will be protested to-morrow. I see you know it already Mrs. Macsimum's Bill.
                     well, you now see how impossible it is for him to assist you."</p>
                  <p>"It is! it is!" cried Mrs. Macsimum, utterly humiliated, and trying hard to
                     prevent her tears from streaking her cheeks; "I see it all, and am a miserable
                     woman!"</p>
                  <p>"As to this little affair of Larami's, dear Aurelia—Eh! what's that?" and he
                     started, as something rustled through an alley of huge kalmias.</p>
                  <p>"Oh! it's the pet, Lory, I suppose; he sleeps here every night."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, indeed!" ejaculated Mr. Payne, much relieved; "about this affair of
                     Larami's," he continued, "nothing is simpler. I will just go into that small
                     room, there, and write a cheque, which I will hand her in your presence. As for
                     your husband's failure, I, being chief creditor, can lessen the weight of the
                     blow considerably; nay, I can save him, and I will, Aurelia, if you will only
                     consent to call me friend. Now, try once."</p>
                  <p>"My friend," murmured Mrs. Macsimum, leaning upon his shoulder. "Thanks, dear
                     Aurelia. Now let me go and appease this infuriated milliner."</p>
                  <p>As they stepped from the dusky conservatory into the small study which opened
                     off one end, a gentleman, seated at a table writing, met their view. He turned,
                     on hearing their footsteps, and they recognised Mr. Macsimum.</p>
                  <p>"Ah! is that you, Payne?" he cried, smiling pleasantly; "you catch me doing a
                     little business on the sly. Well,<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7187-00000050"/>
                     well, I'll have done with it for to-night, for I can see you want a <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">tête-à-tête</foreign> with my wife." So saying, he gathered
                     up a couple of slips of paper on which he had been writing, and with a sort of
                     quizzical adieu, left the room.</p>
                  <p>"Happy mortal!" sighed Sillery Payne, as he wrote a cheque for the amount of
                     Larami's bill; "he is not suspicious."</p>
                  <p>"He has never had cause," said Mrs. Macsimum, indignantly—then, recollecting
                     herself, she colored violently, and cracked one of the delicate vanes of her
                     fan.</p>
                  <p>Sillery smiled.</p>
                  <p>"Now, Aurelia," said he, "let us go and see Larami."</p>
                  <p>"Pardon me, Mr. Sillery Payne," said Mr. Macsimum, presenting himself smilingly
                     at the door, just as that gentleman was about to emerge with the enchanting
                     Aurelia on his arm. "Pardon me, Mr. Sillery Payne, you may spare yourself the
                     trouble. I have just had an interview with that amiable <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >modiste.</foreign>"</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Macsimum shrieked, and, gliding to the nearest sofa, disposed herself in
                     the most approved comatose attitude. Mr. Sillery Payne fiddled with his
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">breloques,</foreign> while an air of unpleasant
                     silliness, commencing at his boots, began to spread itself gradually over his
                     entire figure.</p>
                  <p>"I am immensely indebted to you, Mr. Payne, for the interest that you take in
                     my wife's affairs, and would be only too happy that she should avail herself of
                     your liberal offers, if there was any longer a necessity for it. Thanks to some
                     conversation which I happened to overhear in the conservatory——"</p>
                  <p>A renewed shriek from Mrs. Macsimum on the sofa, and sudden assumption of a
                     more striking <foreign xml:lang="FRA">pose.</foreign>
                  </p>
                  <p>"Which I happened to overhear," continued Mr. Macsimum, entirely oblivious of
                     his spouse's efforts to obtain sympathy—"and was consequently enabled to be
                     beforehand. Madame Larami, Mr. Sillery Payne, I have the honor to inform you.
                     has just been paid in full."</p>
                  <p>"I am happy to hear, Mr. Macsimum," answered Mr. Payne, with sarcastic
                     emphasis, "that your affairs are in so flourishing a condition. I trust that
                     they will remain so until after to-morrow."</p>
                  <p>"When I drew that check, Mr. Payne, to pay for my wife's follies, it was the
                     last money that I had in the bank. I gave it willingly, sir, because I
                     preferred being a pauper myself, to my wife being a beggar. As I went to the
                     door, sir, a telegraphic dispatch from Boston met me, which alters the face of
                     my affairs considerably; and if Mr. Sillery Payne will present those claims on
                     the firm of Macsimum &amp; Bullrush, which he holds, to-morrow at twelve
                     o'clock, he will find little traces of insolvency in their bank account."</p>
                  <p>At this juncture, Mrs. Macsimum seemed to be restored suddenly to animation.
                     She forsook her elegant attitude, and came over timidly, but with an air of
                     penitence, whether honest or not I dare not speculate, to where her husband
                     stood.</p>
                  <p>"George," she said, in a low voice, "you have read me a lesson. Will you
                     complete your nobleness by forgiving me?"</p>
                  <p>"My dear," answered her husband, "I have too much to blame myself for, not to
                     be lenient to others. You may learn one thing, however, Aurelia, that Madame
                     Larami is a dangerous woman to hold any power over you. She has been known,"
                     and he fixed his eyes upon Mr. Sillery Payne, "to be in the pay of certain
                     fashionable gentlemen for the worst purposes."</p>
                  <p>"I see—I see it all now," murmured Mrs. Macsimum, hiding her burning cheek upon
                     her husband's shoulder.</p>
                  <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7187-00000051"/>
                  <p>"Hush! think no more of it. There! are you not engaged to Mr. Payne for this
                     dance? Mr. Payne! my wife claims your hand, and may I pray that this conjugal
                     exhibition may be no bar to that friendship which you so feelingly
                     solicited."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Sillery Payne bit his lip and bowed. With an inward curse, he took Mrs.
                     Macsimum's hand, and was soon whirling her off in a waltz; but it was observed
                     by the guests that they did not dance together again that evening.</p>
                  <p>By a singular coincidence, the same moment saved Mr. Macsimum's credit and his
                     wife's reputation.</p>

                  <head>I.</head>
                  <p>OF all festivities at which it has been my fortune to assist, the annual
                     merry-making in the fine old mansion, given by Major Wherrey, in commemoration
                     of the gathering in of the cranberries, appear to me the most choice and
                     delectable.</p>
                  <p>I know that cavillers may try to invalidate this opinion by mentioning the
                     fact, that this same Major Wherrey happens to be my uncle: or—what I confess
                     would be more to the purpose—that Mrs. Major Wherrey (Kate Lawton that was) is
                     undoubtedly my aunt. But I firmly believe myself unbiassed by family
                     considerations, in the declaration just made; and so emphasize the matter by
                     asserting that our Cranberry Party at Bearbrook, bears the same superiority
                     over all other balls, picnics, or clambakes that, in the opinion of Mr.
                     Addison's Cato, an hour of virtuous liberty held and possessed over an eternity
                     of bondage.</p>
                  <p>Eight years ago, when my uncle began to read upon the subject of cranberries,
                     and favor all his friends with copies of a certain agricultural journal,
                     containing lengthy dissertations going to prove the extreme practicability of
                     raising bushels of this acid production upon land generally held profitless—at
                     that time, I say, who could have anticipated that all this cogitation and
                     scribbling was necessary to make way for a charming little note from a

                     Wacklestead by a line of stars, but it was copied before I thought what I was
                     about, and erasures so dreadfully disfigure a manuscript, and—on the whole it

                     that had blessed this genial season, and my shoulders experienced a ghostly
                     aching as I reflected upon the ceremony of "raking in," at which I had formerly
                     assisted. My answer—of which I happened to take a pressed copy, by way of
                     testing a newly contrived machine—was as follows:</p>

                              <p>"DEAR AUNT KATE:—It will give me great pleasure to come to
                                 Bearbrook next Friday week; though I can assure you there will be
                                 no stronger attraction than the satisfaction of visiting my amiable
                                 relative who is there resident. Pray make my respects to my uncle,
                                 and assure him of my deep regret that an unfortunate business
                                 engagement will prevent me from accepting his kind offer of the
                                 rake. I shall, however, be able to leave town by the eleven o'clock
                                 train, which will bring me to your table a little after the

                  <p>So much by way of introduction—for I can never give an account of anything
                     without beginning a little way back—thus taking, as it were, a gentle run, in
                     order to leap into the narrative with greater vigor. Not that any apology is
                     necessary for the publication of these letters; which are conceived to be full
                     as much to the purpose as the well known communications between committees and
                     orators, which occupy the first page or two of the pamphlet containing their
                     efforts—wherein the committee inclose a vote that somebody has passed
                     respecting a chaste, elegant, and patriotic address, and the orator feigns to
                     be taken by surprise, and says that his speech was hastily prepared amid the
                     pressure of important business, and that no thought of publication had ever
                     entered his fancy—from all which the reader is expected to perceive what
                     knowing fellows the committee are, and what an uncommonly clever affair the
                     orator <emph>could</emph> have produced, if he'd only tried.</p>
                  <p>The eleven o'clock train on the morning of that Thursday to which the attention
                     of the reader is now invited, performed its journey with unusual dispatch, and
                        brought<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7187-00000053"/> me to the carryall, that
                     plied between my uncle's house and the station, full fifteen minutes before the
                     hour anticipated.</p>
                  <p>"Well! your honor's got in early to-day," remarked Mr. Netleswing, my uncle's
                     farmer and right-hand man, who, to do me especial honor, had condescended to
                     drive the carryall.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, we made a quick run of it."</p>
                  <p>"Well, now, I tell you what it is, Squire, you ought to ha' been up here to see
                     them cranberries took in! It was a sight, now—I tell <emph>you.</emph> There
                     was Deacon Smiler, who fetched his in day before yesterday. Well I says he—by
                     gorry, says he, it <emph>does</emph> take you to raise cranberries, and that's
                     a fact. What do you think o' them now?"</p>
                  <p>Thus saying, Mr. Netleswing produced a handful of the produce in question for
                     my inspection.</p>
                  <p>"Well, now," continued he, without waiting for an opinion, "your uncle's just
                     the first man in this county! Why, he's a beautiful old feller. To see him out
                     there today with his coat off, a raking in cranberries for dear life! My wife,
                     says she to me, says she, I never lived along with such a gentleman anywheres;
                     and there's ma'am, too, says she, treats people so well, and never comes round
                     scoldin' and hinderin', and then there's Mr. Tom, that's you, sir, when he
                     comes down here"—</p>
                  <p>"Well, well," said I, anxious to stop the stream of family compliments, "pray
                     do not reveal what I trust Mrs. Netleswing did not mean to have repeated—but
                     tell me what has become of old Esop, that always used to be driven between the
                     house and the station? You have rather a smarter beast in the shafts
                     to-day."</p>
                  <p>"Well, now," responded my driver, commencing with his usual exordium, "there's
                     just—just a little story about this 'ere mare, that I should like to tell your
                     honor. You know that bull the Major had up here last spring—real Durham blood,
                     and all that. Well, Squire Stebbins owned one that came from the same cow, and
                     he turned out so dreadful ugly that he had to be killed for beef. Well, now,
                     bull-beef don't pay at all, you know—leastways, 'cept when it's kinder young.
                     So when the Major told me how Steb-bins's bull down here'd been actin', and how
                     he wanted our'n killed, too, I says, says I, don't you do no such a thing; that
                     bull can be tackled up, come ploughin' time, and the work he'll do'll be worth
                     a sight more'n his beef. Well! the Major he was dreadful scarey, and thought
                     he'd kill somebody, and it was 'bout a week 'fore he finally give in. Well,
                     sir, I just went and put a ring through that feller's nose, and he ploughed for
                     us just as pretty as a baby, sir—just as pretty as a <emph>baby,</emph> I tell
                        <emph>you.</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"But what has this to do with the mare?"</p>
                  <p>"Well, now, I'm a-comin' to that business. As our bull was ploughin' one day,
                     who should come up but Cap'en Tolliwot, who goes in for stock like all time.
                     Look here, Cap'en, says I, just you look at that bull. Well, by thunder, says
                     the Cap'en, I never see a bull broke that way afore, no how—real Durham,
                     too—will you take fifty dollars for him? No, Cap'en, says I, that feller's
                     worth his hundred and fifty if he's worth a cent—first-rate stock for milk—kind
                     in all harness—but I tell you what I'll do; we want another horse on the place,
                     and I'll swap even for your bay mare. Well, the Cap'en swore he wouldn't think
                     of it; but I see him eying the bull, and knew he wanted him bad, so I stuck
                     out. Well, sir, he came round the next day, and said he'd make the swap. Won't
                     do, says I, there's been two men up here to look at him this morning—can't
                     trade without twenty dollars to boot. Give you ten, says he. Split it at
                     fifteen, says I. Done! says he. There! sir, that's the way we came by<pb
                        n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7187-00000054"/> this 'ere mare. We meant to ha' sold
                     the bull this fall, and I 'spose we'd ha' got—well! we might ha' got sixty
                     dollars for him. This mare's worth a hundred and fifty this minute. So, I call
                     it—well—I call it a pretty fair trade."</p>
                  <p>Several anecdotes of this description, all going to establish the shrewdness
                     and sagacity of the relator, pleasantly beguiled the time till we drove up to
                     the venerable mansion.</p>
                  <p>My uncle was soon at the door, and my aunt too—you may be sure of
                        <emph>that.</emph> They are not the sort of people to keep a guest standing
                     in the porch till a servant answers the bell. Who would have guessed, by the
                     Major's hearty shake of the hand, that the "raking in" had begun at seven
                     o'clock that morning? And my aunt, too—how fresh and blooming she looked! What
                     mortal nephew could be content with expressing his respect towards so fair a
                     relative <emph>merely</emph> by a shake of the hand! If you can send me an
                     authentic account of any such individual (properly sworn to before the nearest
                     mayor), I may hereafter express contrition that I was <emph>not;</emph> but
                     until such a document is received, I really cannot think of making an apology.
                        <emph>Apology</emph> indeed! I regret having written the word. It is a wrong
                     to the glorious liberality of a community that gives its wives and daughters to
                     the polking embrace of any adventurer who may ask such favor, to suppose that a
                     man could be required to gird himself with the sackcloth of a penitent, for the
                     affectionate salutation of his own aunt. No, no—rather let us be thankful that
                     an enlightened popular sentiment requires no such ignominious squeamishness at
                     the hands of those who would court its favor.</p>
                  <p>The company had not gone to dinner, but were privately consulting their watches
                     (at least the <emph>rakers</emph> were so doing), and stealing glances towards
                     the screen of green baize that stood in the entry to cover the retreat of the
                     plate-bearers. There were numerous additions—such agreeable additions as must
                     always follow a lady—to the usual circle of guests that the season brought
                     together. There was Harry Wittlepipes, the moustached, pensive, and interesting
                     flirt—and Dick Horripitts, who knows how to lead a <emph>German,</emph> if ever
                     a man did; and there, too, was the young lady with the talent for crayon heads,
                     and her sister with the talent for private theatricals, to say nothing of her
                     brother without any talent in particular; there you might have seen Squire
                     Tolliwot, the present possessor of the amiable bull, of whose barter the
                     particulars have been written; besides, there was—but on the whole it is not
                     worth while to trouble the reader with any more names just at present. And so
                     the curtain shall be lowered for a minute or two, just to bring on the
                     properties, and change the scene to the dining-room, where, having refreshed a
                     little with soup, and stimulated a little with champagne, we will pursue this
                     chronicle in good earnest.</p>

                  <p>THE American cranberry, gentlemen," observed my uncle, from the lower end of
                     the table (after the soup before mentioned had been removed, and the champagne
                     just referred to had been opened)—"the American cran berry has characteristics
                     very different from the plant that bears the same name in England. It is
                     larger, more upright, and has leaves of greater convexity. The best method that
                     has come to my knowledge of raising the American cranberry in England, was the
                     ingenious contrivance<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7187-00000055"/> trivance of
                     Sir Joseph Barker. An artificial bog was prepared by this gentleman, in a
                     manner that I shall presently explain, and the cranberry plants, brought from
                     their native situation with the earth carefully about their roots, throve
                     wonderfully. But a very curious difference observed between these vines and the
                     Vaccinium Oxycoccus, described by Linnæus, consisted in the—"</p>
                  <p>"Good heavens!" whispered my aunt, "what shall I do? These good people have
                     heard of nothing but cranberries since seven o'clock this morning—we must make
                     him stop—do some of you tell me what to do!"</p>
                  <p>The reflection of a moment suggested an expedient. A card with this little bit
                     of writing upon it, was sent by a servant to my uncle's end of the table—</p>

                  <p>"Talk! talk—all of you," whispered Mrs. Kate, the instant my uncle paused in
                     his harangue to look at the card. "Don't let him get the floor again, or we
                     shall never have an end of it."</p>
                  <p>Thus adjured, Bessie Wacklestead and I, who were on one side of my aunt, and
                     Wittlepipes, and the pretty Miss McDudley, who were opposite to us on the
                     other, buzzed away as fast as possible; while my clever relative gave
                     directions long and loud to the servants, and rattled the plates together with
                     great dexterity.</p>
                  <p>The object was accomplished by this magnificent <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >coup.</foreign> After one or two despairing looks, directed towards our
                     corner of the apartment, my uncle resigned himself to fate, and bestowed his
                     cranberries and his tediousness solely upon his immediate neighbors.</p>
                  <p>"There, now," said my aunt, after she had helped to the chicken-pie—"there is
                     no use in you four people keeping up this constant and confidential intercourse
                     any longer. All the danger has passed; and you will have time enough to flirt
                     after dinner. So, I expect you to extend the conversation for my benefit. Just
                     to think that I'm a poor married woman, that nobody likes to talk to!"</p>
                  <p>If you could have seen the arch look with which my aunt accompanied her
                     words—if you had felt (as I did) those fair black eyes penetrating every fibre
                     with their soft, magnetic influence, it would not have seemed very hard to stop
                     the conversational coach, even at its best speed, to take up such a fascinating
                     passenger. Not that I think a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tête-à-tête</foreign>
                     dinner can generally be improved—that is, provided you get next the right
                     person. But, bless you, such a third person as Aunt Kate is no hindrance at
                     all. She was a regular watering-place belle, and picked up in the course of her
                     wanderings a vast deal of discretion and liberality—and now she's a married
                     woman, and of course understands everything, and—in short, I can assure you,
                     you would no more mind saying anything pleasant before <emph>her,</emph> than
                     you would in the presence of a domestic cat.</p>
                  <p>"My dear aunt," said I, "has not experience taught you never to use the vulgar
                     verb 'to flirt!' You remember what a set-down you gave the lady who asked if
                     you <emph>polked;</emph>—'No, madam, I <emph>dance'</emph>—was your reply.
                     Depend upon it that those who <emph>polk</emph> are not more anxious that their
                     performance receives the sanctification of <emph>dancing,</emph> than are those
                     who flirt (if such people there be) desirous of making a compromise with
                     conscience by selecting a suave and gentle word to express their

                  <p>"I can't say I exactly agree with you," said Wittlepipes, withdrawing his eyes
                     from the face of his companion, and adjusting himself for one of those
                     outpourings of talk for which he was famous—"I do not agree with you in

                     infirmity or transgression. It is very true that there have been few people so
                     often held up to scorn, and so generally supposed to be very naughty, as those
                     whose impulsive nature and ability of pleasing lead to that exercise of power
                     known as 'flirting.' Those esteemed guilty of this folly are held up to
                     virtuous indignation in all possible ways. They sustain the unwholesome drizzle
                     of moral novels, and are pelted with those caustic little scraps that fill odd
                     corners of family newspapers. Now I advance the doctrine that a flirtation, in
                     itself, may be as innocent and harmless as a game of billiards, or an evening
                     at the theatre. Like every other good thing, it may be greatly abused; but
                     whether so natural and universal an enjoyment should be condemned from a few
                     doubtful stories of broken hearts, is, I conceive, an open question. I am in
                     the habit of taking a glass of port with my dinner, notwithstanding some people
                     drink more than is good for them—I often play a game of whist, although many
                     have been ruined by cards—and why, by a parity of reasoning, should those be
                     utterly condemned who talk nonsense, and look lovingly in retired places,
                     because match-making mammas and sensitive daughters, have occasionally been
                     disappointed. I should be the last to excuse a lady or gentleman who, merely as
                     a trial of skill, endeavored to interest a person with whom they felt no
                     sympathy. But I really have some charity for those who, bewitched by a bright
                     eye and pleasant smile, say certain things that are not meant, or taken in
                     sober earnest,—but which serve to dispel the distasteful business of the day,
                     and charm the senses into a state of fairy ecstasy, which leaves us all the
                     better when it has passed away. You may talk of the pleasures of courtship and
                     the felicity of an avowed, respectable, commonplace engagement; but what is the
                     satisfaction of making long and compelled visits, of being smiled upon by
                     papas, and congratulated by brothers, to the delight of making your way in
                     spite of these powerful coadjutors, and creating an agreeable little
                     understanding, all the more tender because unacknowledged to the world. 'Mr.
                     So-and-So is a flirt'—how often do we hear such a sentence repeated, as if it
                     implied all that is mean and contemptible! Not so fast, I am tempted to say; my
                     young friend So-and-So exercises a talent that you never possessed. Nature
                     designed you for a place in an office or counting-room; you have a pretty knack
                     at speculating; you can write, drive, or play chess, as well as any one—but you
                     have neither the figure, quickness, nor wit, to make yourself popular with the
                     ladies; so do not judge so hardly those who have, and use them. In short, I
                     consider the faculty of flirting as much a native grace and individual
                     endowment, as is an extraordinary ability for making money a wonderful aptitude
                     at getting rid of it, or any other natural gift. Let, then, such persons as are
                     accused of this unfortunate practice be tried by their peers; and not by those
                     whose dull and lymphatic natures can no more feel the temptation to pass an
                     hour in a light and pleasant strife for admiration, than their stupidity would
                     allow them to effect it, if they did."</p>
                  <p>"It must be acknowledged," observed my aunt, "that a great deal of the fun of
                     flirting comes from its doubtful propriety. We don't know that there's anything
                     exactly <emph>wrong</emph> in trying to be as charming as we can, but we feel
                     an uncertainty about it, a wondering what people will think, and a half
                     admiration at our own boldness, which<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7187-00000057"
                     /> gives an infinite relish to the business. What a pity it is that the
                     consciousness of provoking scandal should ever be attended with satisfaction;
                     yet who cannot sympathize with the pork-loving gentleman who wished himself a
                     Jew, that the enjoyment of his favorite dish might be heightened by the
                     knowledge that he was sinning with every mouthful."</p>
                  <p>"I believe you are in the right, madam," rejoined Wittlepipes, "just as firmly
                     as I believe half this persecution proceeds from mere envy. There are but few
                     of either sex who have the talent and address to make themselves really
                     interesting, even for a single evening; and the world vents its spleen upon
                     those who are more gifted than their neighbors—just as the fairy tales always
                     makes the brightest boy the most unpopular in the family."</p>
                  <p>Here, Miss Bessie and I came in strongly on the other side of the question. We
                     endeavored to show that the judgment of the world was exceedingly correct, and
                     that those people who did not exercise their ingenuity in such questionable
                     pleasantries were prevented by a severe morality, rather than by any natural
                     disability.</p>
                  <p>The argument was waxing rather hot and loud upon both sides, when Mr. Barnard,
                     who sat just below Miss McDudley, turned and said—"What a pity that no one ever
                     found out what Professor Phantillo's recipe for becoming irresistibly
                     fascinating happened to be; we should then be competent judges in the case—at
                     least according to the opinion of friend Wittlepipes."</p>
                  <p>"As for the Professor," rejoined Madam Kate (she always prided herself on the
                     cleverness of the trick, and consequently was glad enough to talk of it when
                     occasion could be made)—"when I came to Bearbrook I had the curiosity to make
                     some inquiries about him. It seems he is a sort of matrimonial agent, and
                     really undertakes to provide people with partners at prices varying according
                     to the style of article they demand. One of his circulars, containing a full
                     tariff of charges, was left at the house the other day. I wonder what was done
                     with it!"</p>
                  <p>"A tariff of charges!" cried Mr. Barnard; "come, come, this bringing matters,
                     honestly and frankly, to the mercantile standard really pleases me! I can
                     imagine the composition of such a document First, in large letters down the
                     page {omitting the small type between each sentence) we should find—Professor

                     Attention—Partners Positively Insured—Certificates From Clergymen of Various
                     Denominations—One Price System—and then, in smaller letters, we should read the
                     particulars:—For a first-class young man, of good family and independent
                     fortune, $30—ditto, with moustache and yellow kids, $35. For a young gentleman

                     warranted his first love, $16. For an old gentleman of princely fortune,
                     $50—ditto, when warranted to die in six months, $95. For a gay young buck, with

                  <p>"Stop, stop, you sarcastic creature," interrupted my aunt; "no ladies should
                     listen to so preposterous a libel; besides, let me tell you, you set your wares
                     very much too high. You will never find purchasers at such exorbitant
                     rates."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, madam," replied Mr. B., "you do me great injustice; these are only the
                     choice patterns, designed for people of property, fashion, and taste. See, how
                     I would cater for the poor and vulgar, who, of course, must put up with a cheap
                     and inferior article. Professor Phantillo has<pb n="114-115"

                  <p>"Why you miserable old cynic," exclaimed my aunt, giving her head the prettiest
                     little toss imaginable, "you're as bad as the Potiphar Papers, I declare you
                     are! But this is always the way with you literary gentlemen—you think it
                     necessary to keep up your claim to consideration, by affecting to be far above
                     the weaknesses of ordinary mortals."</p>
                  <p>"No, no," said Mr. Barnard, speaking with some deliberation, for he saw that
                     most at table had turned to listen to him; "heaven forbid that I should be
                     responsible for any such creed as that. On the contrary, I am of opinion that a
                     severe and just series of magazine articles might be written, with <title>Our
                        Literary Society,</title> for a title."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, do write them, Mr. Barnard, and I'll promise to read them all, and to cut
                     out your picture, when we get it as a frontispiece to <title>Putnam,</title>
                     and have it neatly framed in black-walnut, and it shall always hang in my
                     dressing-room."</p>
                  <p>"No—I have never written for magazines, and hardly think I shall begin now;
                     besides, I think it very doubtful if <emph>Mr. Putnam,</emph> or the editor of
                     any other periodical, would choose to publish such papers. It would be hard to
                     avoid the suspicion of personality, where the class under consideration are so
                     generally known and conspicuous. And, indeed, one would be strongly tempted to
                     draw upon individuals—think, for instance, what materials could be taken from
                     Mrs. ——'s Sunday evening teas. The jealousy, toadyism, petty abuse, slander,
                     and servility, that are on weekly exhibition in those two small parlors, would
                     supply material for some very graphic bits of composition! What a recognizable
                     character we should have in that <foreign xml:lang="FRA">femme
                        precieuse,</foreign> Miss A., who was so consumed with envy at the success
                     of Mrs. B.'s novel, that she actually bribed (not indeed with money, but with
                     certain social favors the initiated can appreciate) one of her followers to
                     write a savage notice of the same for the lowest of the evening papers. You
                     have all heard the old story of the <emph>lion,</emph> who, having devoted his
                     youth to the practice of the fine arts, acquired through his masterly handling
                     of animated nature, the reputation of a very Landseer among the beasts. His
                     great fame was, as you will remember, mainly based upon a copy (with slight
                     alterations) of a wonderful picture possessed by some Timbuctoo Athenaeum, or
                     Art-Union, representing a man in the act of conquering a lion. The
                        <emph>emendation</emph> made in the subject (which was considered by the
                     savans of the forest equal to the best guess of Mr. Collier's annotator)
                     consisted in a very trifling change in the arrangement of the figures. By this
                     "new reading," the <emph>conquering</emph> was just the other way—and the man,
                     unarmed and helpless, lay at the mercy of the artist. If now I were required to
                     write a new "moral" to this suggestive fable, it would read something like
                     this: There have been recently published various articles from various pens,
                     setting forth the lamentable condition of the fashionable society of American
                     cities. The papas are all shown to be weak and covetous, the young ladies
                     hopelessly silly, and the gentlemen inordinately dissipated. But let one of
                     these waltzers turn chronicler—give him a note-book, and drift him gently into
                     the literary clique that exists in every large city, and I will promise you
                     revelations more startling, and weaknesses far more humiliating, than the
                     keenest observer can gather from the well-gleaned fields of wealth, fashion,
                     and their quarry of frivolities."</p>

                  <p>As no one seemed disposed to dispute the justness of reflections that seemed so
                     pleasant a compensation for the wrongs that satirists have inflicted upon Young
                     America, a short pause in the conversational action followed Mr. Barnard's
                     remarks. My uncle's observations again floated to our part of the table.</p>
                  <p>"The Swedish cranberry is not used as an article of consumption. It is,
                     however, employed in boiling silver plate to its due degree of whiteness—the
                     sharp acid corroding the superficial particles of me copper alloy. And now I am
                     prepared to answer your question concerning the best mode of keeping this
                     delicious production. I have discovered two ways in which the cranberry may be
                     preserved in perfection for several years. The first is by drying the fruit
                     carefully in the sun, and then stoppering it closely in bottles. The second,
                     which I always recommend, and which will require a little illustration to
                     describe, consists——"</p>
                  <p>Here, my aunt made a successful sortie of talk, and succeeded in spiking the
                     enemy's guns.</p>
                  <p>But if you wish to know what she, or anybody else, said, you must consult some
                     other member of the company, for the fact is, that I concluded the dinner in a
                     subdued and confidential chat with my fair neighbor, Miss Wacklestead. And as
                     the observations exchanged between the parties in question, though of great
                     interest to themselves, cannot possibly concern the reader, we will hurry
                     matters on, and the ladies off.</p>
                  <p>Well! when the last skirt had vanished through the folding-doors, and those
                     huge portals had closed after the retreating beauties, my uncle invited us to
                     draw our chairs to his end of the table. Then, according to annual custom, were
                     produced certain bottles of that old Con-stantia wine, which some connection of
                     our family had imported in the year '73. And a famous old vintage it is—rather
                     sweet and syrupy by reason of age, but still of a flavor and fragrance that
                     recall the best beams of the sunny days that ripened the parent grape.</p>
                  <p>At all events, its effect upon the company was benignant and genial. My uncle
                     (having relieved his mind of its outer crust of cranberries) was very
                     entertaining, and gave his version of the bull story with infinite humor. Mr.
                     Barnard favored us with his favorite song known as the "Cockroach at Home," and
                     we all roared out the chorus about the little cockroaches, who declare that
                     they will not go to school without a double dose of lager-bier. Then there came
                     some "imitations," by Wittlepipes, which were so exquisitely unlike the
                     originals as to be extemely ridiculous. After that, there was another song,
                     written for the occasion, very personal, and very funny—so much so, indeed,
                     that it will not do for me to tell who sang it, or give the slightest abstract
                     of its contents. Then everybody began to talk, though there seemed to be nobody
                     disposed to listen—if we except two or three elderly citizens, who had gone to
                     sleep. At which period of the entertainment, it suddenly occurred to my uncle
                     that it was time to join the ladies—as perhaps it was.</p>
                  <p>And here I propose to make another break in this narrative, for the purposes of
                     meditation and preparation, before treating myself (and I trust, the reader) to
                     a third and last chapter. Such pauses serve as opiates to the great agony of
                     composition, and prepare the mind for a renewal of that earnest thought, and
                     careful elaboration, which has hitherto characterized this history. But before
                     closing, I may as well say, that several hours are supposed to elapse before
                     the opening of the succeeding chapter. For it must treat of
                        <emph>dancing</emph>—and I should show great ignorance<pb n="118-119"
                        xml:id="VAC7187-00000060"/> of the natural laws, to expect the reader to
                     take a mental part therein, after the dinner he has just finished.</p>
                  <p>So, while the servants are clearing the table, the gentlemen on the piazza
                     talking over the ladies, and the ladies in the parlor talking over the
                     gentlemen, we (that is to say, myself, and my before-mentioned reader) will
                     take a nap, call for a cigar, read the paper, or, in fine, amuse ourselves as
                     we best may.</p>

                  <p>This making fun of the bewilderment and concern of a neighbor, is at the best a
                     very questionable diversion. Still, if anybody is foolish enough to do it,
                     there is no additional harm in conducting matters after a methodical and
                     approved fashion. And this may excuse me for giving two recipes for the
                     successful obtaining of this pleasant excitement—both of which I have seen put
                     into practice, and can conscientiously recommend. The first, which is rather
                     limited in its application—requiring no less of scenery and preparation than is
                     found at a masked ball at the Grand Opera-House, at Paris—may be stated
                     thus:</p>
                  <p>Take as the first ingredient, a verdant American youth (a Bostonian is always
                     to be preferred), who has plenty of money, a limited understanding, and an
                     overweening sense of his own and his family's importance. Then select
                     half-a-dozen of the most intelligent <emph>ladies</emph> of your acquaintance,
                     who are to be instructed to repeat certain sentences in the English tongue
                     relating to family failings and eccentricities, which are supposed by the house
                     of Somptueux (of which our friend is a promising scion), to be its own private
                     property,—but which nevertheless <emph>are</emph> the talk of the town.</p>
                  <p>Now take your newly-arrived countryman to the theatre, circus, or some place of
                     public amusement, and finally, by the merest accident, propose to look in upon
                     the masked ball at the opera. Here, having previously arranged matters with
                     confederates, you make some excuse for leaving him a few minutes, and slip
                     quietly into a private box near by, whence you may peep between the curtains
                     and enjoy the fun. Mr. Somptueux has begun to be oppressed with a realization
                     of his own unimportance, in the presence of so many people of whose customs and
                     language he knows almost nothing, and whom he of course presumes have precisely
                     the same amount of information concerning him—when a gay little mask runs up
                     and addresses him by his Christian name, and demands, half in French and half
                     in English, the particulars of that little affair with Anna Skeusomai, and
                     whether it was <emph>really true</emph> that one of the guests pocketed a
                     miniature at her last party!</p>
                  <p>"How in the name of wonder!"—ejaculates poor S—"<emph>can</emph> this French
                     woman—but no!—of course she <emph>can't</emph>—such a peculiar name too!—what
                     an extraordinary coincidence—I never would have believed it."</p>
                  <p>"Monsieur, if you please," says a timid little voice on the other side, "I
                     would entender ze end of ze story about Aunt Kottabos and ze confituriere. How
                     much was to pay, to say nothing of the naughty names she called!"</p>
                  <p>"Just heaven!" mutters poor Somptueux, staggering against the nearest box,
                     "there can be no <emph>coincidence</emph> here. To think those unfortunate
                     expressions that my poor Aunt Kottabos in a moment of justifiable indignation
                     applied to the confectioner, and which were so handsomely paid for, that we
                     felt sure nobody could have heard of them—to <emph>think</emph> that they
                     should be the common talk of Paris."</p>
                  <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7187-00000061"/>
                  <p>The poor fellow has no time to prepare a reply, or to beg the lady not to
                     mention it any further, before his arm is taken by another fair friend, who
                     wishes to know how it was possible that Cousin Sophy could have caught Mr.
                     Optimus after that scandalous flirtation with Herr Kewpidd of the Belgravian
                     Musical Society. Another tells some little adventures after Grandmother Vinum's
                     last dinner; while a fifth breathes a family secret most important and
                     significant—in short, a disclosure that makes our moneyed aristocrat tremble
                     for his gentility.</p>
                  <p>Well, the reader may imagine the course of horror, bewilderment, and blank
                     dismay, to which bur friend was treated—he may also imagine (if he can) the
                     satisfaction in assisting at the dispensation of such heroic practice.</p>
                  <p>And now for the second method of producing a salutary astonishment in the
                     breast of a fellow creature—a method that was practised at Bearbrook with
                     entire success, upon the occasion now under consideration.</p>
                  <p>Take a middle-aged or elderly gentleman of retired habits, refined tastes, and
                     courtly manners—take, I say, some such pattern of a past school—and introduce
                     him to a <emph>German.</emph> Of course you do not understand that the effect
                     is to be produced by simply arming up some dweller by the Rhine, and repeating
                     his name with that of the subject selected. A <emph>German,</emph> in its
                     fashionable and orthodox significance, means, not a man, but a dance—a dance
                     that the French call "the cotillon"—and which such Yankee gentlemen as affect
                     an exaggerated Parisianity, designate <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Lur
                        Cotyeeyon.</foreign> But, if (a contingency hardly to be imagined in an
                     enlightened reader of <emph>Putnam)</emph> you should never have seen the
                     diversion in question, and demand at my hands a description of the same, I
                     shall really be puzzled what to say. The most contradictory epithets are
                     constantly applied to it. Dick Horripitts, in his sweetest manner, speaks of it
                     as <foreign xml:lang="FRA">un rêve du bonheur des dieux;</foreign> while old
                     Mrs. Sockdolager screamed out to me the other evening that she could never see
                     it without thinking of Furrelli's great picture, "The Last Ball in Babylon,"
                     that hangs in one of the palaces at Florence.</p>
                  <p>So, if you please, I will advance no particular opinion, but keep to my
                     legitimate business, which is to report in a very humble way, the noticeable
                     points in our evening festivity.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, yes, I'm going to dance this new dance of yours," exclaimed my uncle in
                     the innocence of his heart; "I've never seen it, to be sure, so you'll have to
                     instruct me at first, but I shall soon get it by a little attention."</p>
                  <p>"If you have really never seen the German cotillion," quietly remarked Mr.
                     Barnard, "I should advise you to bestow the <emph>little attention</emph> as a
                     spectator, before attempting to appear upon the floor."</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps you are right; though I remember getting through the Virginian Reel
                     and the Basket Quadrille, when Kate introduced them last winter for the first
                     time; but still, if you will keep me in countenance, we will take chairs at the
                     other end of the room, and see how we like it."</p>
                  <p>So the Major and his companion went to the other end of the room, and the music
                     gave those long-drawn sighs of anguish elicited by the process of tuning—and
                     Dick Horripitts began to be very important, and bustle about, and marshal the
                     company with a fan by way of truncheon—and finally all things were ready, and
                     off we went in good earnest.</p>
                  <p>The party that met round the dinner-table had received many important additions
                     from the citizens and <foreign xml:lang="FRA">citoyennes</foreign> of
                     Bearbrook;—and some very pretty additions, too, from the latter class—though,
                     it must be confessed, that provincial <emph>dancing</emph> is not so good as
                     provincial beauty.</p>
                  <pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7187-00000062"/>
                  <p>My aunt, of course, <emph>led</emph> with Dick Horripilts—and a pretty pair of
                     dancers they were. How they steamed up and down that great room, followed by
                     Bessie Wacklestead and myself, and afterwards by Wittlepipes and the eldest
                     Miss Drachma, and then by everybody else, till the whole apartment seemed a sea
                     of undulating heads. There was some spirit in the dancing that night, I can
                     assure you. Ladies formed parties of threes, and went up and balanced to
                     gentlemen, who quickly clasped them to their hearts and swept wildly off. And
                     then the gentlemen (not to be outdone) formed their parties of three, and fell
                     upon such ladies as they could conveniently catch, and whirled them about, this
                     way and that, till every curl acquired a distinct vibration. When the ribbons
                     were produced, and everybody was mysteriously tied to somebody else, what fun
                     it was to see the very tall lady dance off with the very short
                     gentleman—looking tenderly upon the top of his head. And then to see the tall
                     gentleman, who appeared to be sitting upon air, in painful effort to adapt his
                     stature to that of the short lady. What sport, too, to observe the anguish
                     written upon the countenances of those unpractised in the dance—you would have
                     thought them engaged in the study of spherical trigonometry at the very least.
                     Though, perhaps, after all, you would have found more amusement in observing
                     two or three gentlemen who didn't dance well-but thought they <emph>did.</emph>
                     The smile of perfect satisfaction that rested upon their faces as they trotted
                     about quite independently of their partners, and bumped pleasantly against
                     their neighbors, revived one's faith in the original innocence of humanity. At
                     last we got to that part of the exhibition where the ladies arrange themselves
                     on one side of the room, and the gentlemen on the other, and, at a given
                     signal, rush into a grand embrace. And here is always a general change of
                     partners—so that I found myself turning about Kate Wherrey at one end of the
                     room, while Bessy and Horripitts polked upon my uncle's boots at the other.
                     Then, quick as thought, we changed our positions, and were just charging
                     violently at Mr. Barnard, when my aunt suddenly stopped, exclaiming that her
                     shoe-string had broken, and another must be got to supply its place; so she
                     tripped lightly out of the room, leaving me stranded hard by the bewildered
                     Major.</p>
                  <p>"Tom, Tom," gravely began my uncle (I confess the quiet sadness of his voice
                     made me feel a little unpleasantly), "I never thought to see <emph>you</emph>
                     concerned in such business as this. I never thought you could have permitted
                     such an exhibition to take place under this roof. That picture that hangs
                     opposite the mirror was my mother, and your grandmother, Tom;—it was in this
                     very room she collected her family to hear the precepts of that pure Teacher by
                     whom I verily believe she is now accepted. How can I dare to pray that she may
                     still be near me, and hallow with the benediction of her presence this old
                     house that she loved so well, when it has been disgraced by such—.</p>
                  <p>Tom, I will not speak the words that rise to my lips, lest they should seem too
                     harsh to you—to—to <emph>her</emph>—whom I have promised to respect and to
                     love—but—I am grieved, Tom, I am sorely grieved."</p>
                  <p>I had been prepared for a little amazement on the part of my uncle, and had
                     thought how I could rally him upon having had no such good thing in his younger
                     days; but the simple dignity of his manner quite destroyed my purposed
                     batteries, and threw me wholly upon the defensive.</p>
                  <p>"My dear sir," said I, "you consider this matter far too seriously. It is only
                     because the dance is new to you that you are so unfavorably impressed. Believe
                     me, you, like all the rest of the world, would soon get over this<pb
                        n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7187-00000063"/> squeamishness. Do you not see the
                     three Miss Drachmas, daughters of the Rev. Doctor Drachma, whose sermon against
                     the licentious rites of the Mormons you admired so much—why, they are the crack
                     dancers of Bear-brook, and Miss Fanny has been pouting all the evening because
                     Horripitts didn't ask her to lead."</p>
                  <p>"If this <emph>German</emph> had been invented twenty years ago," observed Mr.
                     Barnard, "it would have spared me one sleepless night. I have not forgotten the
                     evening when, after years of silent devotion—of anxious endeavor to render
                     myself less unworthy the affection of a noble and modest woman—I was allowed
                     the privilege accorded to none before—to none after—of holding a trembling hand
                     in mine, of clasping a delicate waist, that seemed to shrink even from him whom
                     the heart beneath had chosen. Oh! I well remember the night of happy, grateful
                     wakefulness which I passed;—but I don't think the thrill would have lasted
                     quite so long, if I had seen the same familiarity permitted to every idle
                     dissipated fellow who kept up such small modicum of worldly respectability as
                     is necessary to gain admittance to a fashionable ball. No, no, sir; such a
                     public rehearsal would have removed all feeling of especial favor from a more
                     private performance."</p>
                  <p>"You are very unreasonable, sir," I exclaimed (I could talk to Barnard in a way
                     that I should not have been willing to do to my uncle); "you are both
                     unreasonable and unjust, to condemn those very young ladies, who, coming on to
                     the stage, find this established outlet for the exuberant desire for life and
                     motion that belongs to youth. For nature that would 'cadence her joy of
                     strength,' no more graceful manifestation is at! present appointed. To repress
                     all such impulse cannot be expected. Believe me, we shall do better than in
                     searching after a moral alchemy to turn rose-buds and lilies into wall-flowers
                     before their time."</p>
                  <p>"I condemn no one," replied Mr. Barnard, somewhat warmly; "but perhaps you will
                     allow me to <emph>respect</emph> those ladies (of whom there are more than you
                     seem to think) who are willing to give up the prestige of fashionable position,
                     rather than submit to familiarities which nothing but an abominable custom can
                     for a moment sanctify. I do not urge that it is <emph>against</emph> a young
                     lady that she suffers herself to be whirled about in this <emph>German</emph>
                     night after night; but this I <emph>do</emph> declare, that (in View of all
                     that is given up) it is something very strongly in any woman's
                        <emph>favor</emph> that she does <emph>not.</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"I agree with my friend. Barnard," observed my uncle, "in being unwilling to
                     speak harshly of young people who thoughtlessly fall into improprieties that
                     are countenanced by those who should know better. But my charity is not
                     sufficiently elastic to cover Doctor and Mrs. Drachma, and the dozen fathers
                     and mothers who lead our society in Bearbrook, whose word could at once put a
                     stop to this indecorous exhibition, and introduce in its stead some of the old
                     and unexceptionable dances in which all could join without sacrifice of
                     self-respect."</p>
                  <p>"You are quite right, Major," said Mr. B.; "there are, in every society, some
                     dozen or twenty matrons, at whose command the waves of any fashionable
                     frivolity could at once be stayed. And these—by refusing to allow their
                     daughters to join in what offends the taste and judgment of many people whose
                     feelings deserve respect—could effectually banish this degrading exhibition to
                     places where it property belongs."</p>
                  <p>What more was said on this disputed topic I did not hear, for Bessie
                     Wacklestead (just at this point) ran up to take me out. So <emph>out</emph> I
                     went, and was soon rebaptized in the fellowship of the German;—yet I confess
                     with an abatement of my former spirit. There was a something<pb n="126-127"
                        xml:id="VAC7187-00000064"/> that grated against my feelings when I saw Kate
                     again embraced by Horripitts—who, although, he <emph>can</emph> lead a German,
                     is a man whose morals and habits are notoriously bad. And although I did not so
                     much object to tenderly pilot the fair Bessie about the room—yet when I was
                     obliged to resign my place to Ned Hurcus, something like an expostulation rose
                     to my lips.</p>
                  <p>Well, a German does not last for ever (although the worthy papas who are
                     obliged to sit it out might not agree with this proposition), and ours was
                     pleasantly interrupted by the arrival of the huge bowl of cranberry punch that
                     was always brewed in honor of the occasion, and which gave an agreeable
                     diversion to the thoughts and conversation of the party.</p>
                  <p>For, if any human weakness clung to gentlemen of such violent virtue as Mr.
                     Barnard and my uncle, I believe it lay in the direction of <emph>punch.</emph>
                     And this fascinating monosyllable, as defined by the authorities of Bearbrook,
                     meant no weak mixture, two-sixths sherry, sugar and lemon, and four-sixths
                     water—but a compound of Which good honest <emph>rum</emph>—and enough of it,
                     too—was the basis; from which arose satisfactory layers of port, cordial and
                     Bordeaux—with just a touch of gin to give it a flavor, and a few cranberries,
                     floating upon the top, to give it a name.</p>
                  <p>The Major and Mr. Barnard were provided with two soup-ladles, by means of which
                     instruments they dispensed the refreshing beverage to the company. The
                     continual demand, however, that was made upon their attention, left little
                     opportunity for a personal indulgence—until Barnard (who was something of a
                     scholar) providentially recollected that the class of men existing in classical
                     times, known as <foreign xml:lang="LAT">dispensatores vini adusti saccharo aqua
                        et limonis</foreign>—whose duties seem to have been very similar to those of
                     the <emph>punch-helpers</emph> of our own day—were solemnly lemnly commanded to
                     drink with every individual who required their services. This excellent and
                     laudable custom the Major and his friend declared should not become obsolete
                     through the culpable neglect of the modern representatives of so honorable a
                     body; and I am bound to say that the ghost of the most rigid "dispensator"
                     could have <emph>tipped out</emph> no censure to his scrupulous successors.</p>
                  <p>After we all had drank enough to experience that pleasant glow that
                     cranberries, taken in this peculiar form, never fail to impart to the human
                     system—some one proposed a moonlight walk in the long avenue before the house.
                     The suggestion was considered most happy; and the ladies ran off to get their
                     bonnets and shawls, and the gentlemen groped under the great sofas in the entry
                     in search of their coats and hats—and soon everybody was ready to set
                     forth.</p>
                  <p>Everybody, except the distinguished individuals who had so ably discharged the
                     honors of the punch, for, just as all were about to start, the question
                     suddenly occurred to the classic brain of Mr. Barnard, whether the ancient
                        <foreign xml:lang="LAT">dispensatores</foreign> were not required to drink
                     up such portions of the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">vinum adustum</foreign> as was
                     unconsumed by the company. My uncle at once decided that, if there was any
                     doubt on the point, it would be highly improper to peril the perfect observance
                     of the ritual, by an omission so serious. Accordingly, the two gentlemen
                     resumed their places at the table—charged their glasses heavily from the great
                     bowl between them—and thus we left them behind us.</p>
                  <p>And, now, my account of this little party is over. It was far brighter and
                     heartier in reality than I have the skill to make it upon paper—and perhaps far
                     brighter to me than it would have been to the reader. For my own<pb n="128-129"
                        xml:id="VAC7187-00000065"/> days of merriment are very few, and on that
                     account this simple country meeting (although it takes place in October) seems
                     a very carnival. And I take quite as much pleasure in it, as you find in your
                     great dinners in the Fifth Avenue, or at the wax-lighted japonica-hung chambers
                     of your costly festivities.</p>
                  <p>How fairly shone the glorious moon that night on the rich dress of Autumn! The
                     curled leaves cracked beneath our feet, as Kate and I left the main party, and
                     walked beneath the mighty pines which skirt the river's side. And now, I feel
                     what an innovation I countenance in hinting that a nephew could presume to
                     advise his aunt. But if you had an aunt of the years, and in the position of
                     Kate Wherrey, I believe you would have done as I did.</p>
                  <p>And what I <emph>did</emph> do was to remind the impulsive young creature who
                     hung upon my arm, of the respect she owed to the opinions, and even to the
                     prejudices, of the man whom she had taken for better and for worse. Then, I
                     told her how shocked my uncle had been with her favorite
                     <emph>German</emph>—and what Mr. Barnard had said about it—and how my own sense
                     of propriety forced me to agree with them, almost against my will.</p>
                  <p>"My dear Tom," replied my aunt, and her fair, dark eyes were moistened as she
                     spoke, "I believe I have been very thoughtless—that my conduct is attributable
                     to nothing worse, I am sure you will not doubt. I have been left too much to
                     myself, and have thought less than I should of the pleasure and convenience of
                     others. While I am mistress at Bearbrook, the Major and his really excellent
                     friend shall never be shocked by a repetition of the frolic of to-night; and,
                     Tom, will not you, who are the only friend of my own age to whose judgment I
                     can appeal—will you not tell me when you think me wrong? and believe that I
                     wish, and try, to do what is right."</p>
                  <p>Those who saw the cheerful and pretty ways with which my aunt presided at the
                     dinner-table, or the lightness and seductive grace with which she swept through
                     the waltz, must have admired her—but, if any one had stood beside us that
                     night, and had heard all the real feeling and womanly tenderness that poured
                     from a heart ordinarily absorbed in the trivialities of the passing hour, he
                     would have loved her as I did, and <emph>do.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was some time before we returned to the house; and finally, as we passed
                     along the plank walk, that passed over the marshes where the cranberries
                     grew—not a word was spoken. The moon not only clad familiar objects with
                     unearthly garments, but sent fantastic shadows to wander in the solemn chambers
                     of the mind.</p>
                  <p>"I know not why we have been silent so long," said Kate, as we entered the
                     porch, "but I have been dreaming over impossibilities—strange and wild ones,
                     too—I know it is very foolish; but it is a way of mine, and I cannot help
                     it."</p>
                  <p>"Nay, nay, dear Kate," I replied, "we may be all the better for such visions;
                     for I have a strong suspicion that <emph>those who never dream, have never
                        truly lived.</emph>"</p>

               <head>V. TOLLIWOTTE'S GHOST.</head>
               <head type="sub">A REMINISCENCE OF BEARBROOK.</head>
               <p>I LOVE an old house. There is something soothing and friendly in its very decay.
                  The dampness that hangs about the parlors, the cracks twisting through the yellow
                  ceiling, and the fearless mice that scratch and scamper behind the wainscot,
                  afford me a satisfaction I never feel in the modern monuments of newly-acquired
                  wealth and vulgar taste, which are fast superseding the solid, comfortable
                  mansions of the last century.</p>
               <p>To fulfil its whole duty, your old house must have a ghost and a pretty woman to
                  live in it. But alas, for the backsliding of the present! We may moan as we will
                  over the weak eyes and pulmonary disorders that beset men and women—but the
                  degeneration of ghosts is a <emph>real</emph> affliction.</p>
               <p>I knew what would come of it when <emph>spectres</emph> took to Webster, and spelt
                  their final syllable <emph>t—e—r.</emph> Who would be afraid of such a spectre as
                  that—or what could he have to communicate that would be at all worth hearing? We
                  should naturally expect such a fellow to exhibit himself for fifty cents (private
                  sittings one dollar), and then deluge us with his awkward flattery and commonplace
                  morality.</p>
               <p>But a good honest ghost, who lives in a sober way in a quiet house in the country,
                  commands my entire respect.</p>
               <p>He has positively no connexion with these vagrant apparitions who are flying about
                  the land—visiting circles here and there—making their ghastly jokes, preaching
                  their feeble homilies, and blowing their tin fish-horns into the ears of sceptics.
                  No, no, our old-fashioned aristocratic ghost (that it does a man good to believe
                  in) has a hearty contempt for these nomadic impostors. There he lives in his
                  little windy attic, or mopes about his damp cellar, and dreams of the good old
                  times when he used to clank his chain about the house, and frighten the straggler
                  who went upstairs to get a book, or make the little group in the parlor stir the
                  fire and draw more closely together as they heard his solemn tramp in the hall.
                  What thrilling interest gathered about his communications when, after years of
                  awful suspense, he deigned to indicate the old well where he had sunk his
                  treasure, or revealed (in the strictest confidence) the precise individual who had
                  defrauded you out of your rightful inheritance, and the steps that should be taken
                  for its recovery.</p>
               <p>Such a ghost as that was worth knowing. Give me one old-fashioned scholarly
                  phantom, who must be talked to in Latin, who appears at the canonical hour of
                  midnight, and, above all, who is content to remain a permanent fixture in your
                  house—and I will resign right, title, and interest, in all and singular tippers,
                  rappers, and trumpeters, that new revelation or old imposture can conjure up.</p>
               <p>I believe that Major Wherrey values the highly respectable Shade who is said to
                  haunt those queer old attic passages that twist in and out under the roof of the
                  Bear-brook mansion, quite as much as any of his more tangible possessions.</p>
               <p>"My dear Tom," he used to say to me, "at the present day I know of but one
                  criterion by which to examine the<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7187-00000067"/>
                  claims of our fashionable neighbors to the social position which they claim. The
                  time was, to be sure, when if a man kept a carriage with his arms painted on the
                  door, and a sober coachman to drive him about town, you might have known he was of
                  gentle descent, and had a goodly company of ancestors to vouch for him. But now
                  everything is changed—carriages are kept by people whose fathers drove them, and
                  arms have their market value, and may be purchased of any engraver. There is,
                  however, one thing the rogues cannot counterfeit. So, when you have any doubt of
                  the antiquity and consequent respectability of a dashing family, ask, not if they
                  keep their groom or their <foreign xml:lang="FRA">coupé,</foreign> but whether
                  they keep their <emph>ghost</emph>—and if they don't, depend upon it they are not
                  what they pretend to be."</p>
               <p>The last time that my uncle thus delivered himself was a year ago last fast-day.
                  Mr. Barnard, Kate, and myself, were lounging easily before the fire (we had just
                  come in damp and sleepy from a lyceum lecture) listening to the strange murmurs of
                  the wind as it rattled the tin spout that passed under the eaves, or wandering
                  about the large chimneys, groaned its solemn requiem over all the glowing hearths
                  and sunny faces that had once beamed upon the oak panelling of the parlor where we
                  sat—and then passed out into the darkness.</p>
               <p>"I think we must have another back-log," remarked Mr. Barnard, who was standing in
                  a "gentlemanly attitude" before the fire, and gazing out into the room with his
                  usual complacency. "I don't feel like going to bed after that strong coffee that
                  Mrs. Wherrey made for the Sunday-school children."</p>
               <p>"Not for the children but for their teachers," interposed my aunt in correction.
                  "I don't know why it is that Doctor Drachma's sewing-circle should drink their tea
                  and coffee so very strong; but as long as they get it at other places, I must have
                  it so here."</p>
               <p>"The old excuse, that would continue every evil in the world," rejoined Barnard.
                  "How fortunate it is there are some people brave enough to act up to their notions
                  of right, without reference to the dicta of the little community with whom fortune
                  has thrown them. Old absurdities, aye, and old iniquities too, linger on the scene
                  when the world is really tired of them, merely because no one has the courage to
                  rise up and-push them off."</p>
               <p>"But this hardly applies to the use of stimulants or narcotics."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps not—even if we include in the latter class the lecture we have listened
                  to this evening—the world has not yet outgrown coffee or lyceums, and we may
                  vainly look for such millennium. But there are, nevertheless, many things in which
                  we are prepared for reform, if some one would only begin it. Take, for instance,
                  this very Sunday-school system whose practical workings have been exhibited this
                  afternoon. What possible good can come of such questions as this (I take the first
                  one I see on opening the text-book)—For what are the rats of the East famous?"</p>
               <p>"For-the-length-of-<emph>their</emph>-tails-and-the-speed-of-<emph>their</emph>-running,"—responded
                  my aunt, admirably mimicking the false emphasis and hurried utterance with which
                  children rattle off the information they have learned by rote.</p>
               <p>"Very well," said Barnard; "now if I were to vary the question a little, and ask
                  you what eastern animal was celebrated for speed and tail, the chances are that
                  you would be utterly perplexed, and complain that there was no such question in
                  the book. Indeed I tried the experiment this afternoon by puzzling a poor little
                  girl who—before Doctor Drachma could well pronounce the question<pb n="134-135"
                     xml:id="VAC7187-00000068"/> tion—What has the camel sometimes been
                  called?—fluently responded—The ship of the desert. But when I asked her what
                  animal had sometimes been called the ship of the desert, the dear little thing was
                  terribly confused, began to cry, and rather thought it was an eastern rat.'</p>
               <p>"I cannot think Sunday-schools particularly desirable for the class of children to
                  be found in Doctor Drachma's congregation," remarked the Major. "They are made to
                  supersede that home instruction and example which the parents are fully able to
                  give, and without which all public teaching seems a very empty pretence. Of course
                  for the children of the poor and illiterate, it is a very different matter. I
                  always subscribe most heartily to any plan for dispensing religious instruction
                  among <emph>them</emph>—and tried my best to persuade Kate to teach in one of the
                  ragged schools during our last winter in New York."</p>
               <p>"Good!" said Mr. Barnard. "I wish you better success next year; though if you use
                  Drachma's catechism I should certainly advise some additions by way of appendix.
                  Why, I should like to know, is it necessary to keep the rising generation posted
                  up concerning eastern rats, to the exclusion of eastern cranberries? Let us hear
                  how some oriental Sir Joseph Banks undertook to grow cranberries in Palestine, and
                  how inferior they were to those produced by Major Wherrey at Bearbrook."</p>
               <p>As any joke touching the precious vegetable production, to the cultivation of
                  which my uncle had devoted so much time and study, was seldom well received—my
                  aunt judged it best to prevent a reply, by sending me into the hall to bring in
                  the back-log that Mr. Barnard had coveted. "I told John he might go and see his
                  cousin at Piccochee to-night," she remarked in explanation, "and as to-morrow is
                  my washing-day, the Women have gone to bed long ago—so we must help
                  ourselves."</p>
               <p>"I am most happy to be of service," said I, advancing to the door, "though I must
                  question John's devotion to his cousin, for his cowhide boots have certainly been
                  wandering about the entry ever since we came home."</p>
               <p>"And by the uncertainty of their movement I should say that John had been drowning
                  his loves or his sorrows in some of his master's punch," drily observed Mr.
                  Barnard.</p>
               <p>As I passed out of the room, we all heard a heavy sound, as of some one falling at
                  full length upon the painted canvas floor-cloth;—but nothing was to be seen. The
                  great hall stove threw its dull red light on nothing save the picture of old Judge
                  Wherrey in his wig and gown, and the stiff chair, glittering bravely with its
                  brass-headed nails, that he used to sit upon when on earth.</p>
               <p>"John! John!" exclaimed my aunt, hurrying after me, and peering upon every square
                  inch of the floor, as if John was a beetle that she feared to crush—"Why, bless
                  me, Major, the man is not here!"</p>
               <p>"No," said my uncle very calmly, "I <emph>knew</emph> he wasn't there. I could
                  have told you what it was at once—only I was afraid we should offend it, and it
                  would go off. This is very pleasant I am really much gratified."</p>
               <p>"And who or what in the name of wonder do all these its refer to," exclaimed
                  Barnard. "Is it a dog or a monkey that has been making himself so audible?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! neither," said my uncle very quietly; "it is only——old Tolliwotte's
                  ghost."</p>
               <p>"A ghost!" screamed my aunt, and threw herself into my arms for protection—"Oh!
                  you horrid, abominable Major—to bring me to this haunted old rat-trap, and then
                  invite ghosts to board, and say you're glad when they come. Oh! dear, dear, where
                  shall I go?"</p>
               <p>Upon consideration it struck Mrs. Kate that she might<pb n="136-137"
                     xml:id="VAC7187-00000069"/> as well stay where she was—a decision to which I
                  had no manner of objection. Indeed, my faith waxed strong in a spiritual
                  manifestation which could give such a comfortable proof of its reality. Dick
                  Horripitts says (although rather more coarsely) that it is good fun to support a
                  pretty girl while dancing the German; but, for my part, I think it is much better
                  fun to do it standing still. And I earnestly counsel those whose business it is to
                  look after such matters, to consider whether a <emph>new figure</emph> introducing
                  this slight improvement might not be generally popular.</p>
               <p>We hurried back into the parlor—I, with a log under each arm, and Kate (being or
                  pretending to be very much frightened) clinging to my skirts—or rather to the
                  garment that fulfils their purpose in a masculine wardrobe. There is surely
                  nothing more taking than to see a pretty woman feign excessive timidity; but then
                  she must be <emph>really pretty</emph> to carry it off—and I cannot recommend one
                  who is not to try so doubtful an experiment. My aunt, however, is quite handsome
                  enough to do as she pleases in this and all other respects—and I am sure you would
                  have fanned, and <emph>salted,</emph> and soothed her quite as zealously as
                  Barnard and I did, had you happened in at the crisis.</p>
               <p>"And who was old Tolliwotte, and what business has his ghost here?" inquired
                  Barnard, when our fair patient was in a condition approaching convalescence.</p>
               <p>"Colonel Tolliwotte"—responded my uncle, in the precise and measured tone of a man
                  who has a story to tell, and who knows it—"Colonel Tolliwotte was the ancestor of
                  Captain Simon Tolliwotte, who owns the farm just over the river. He is described
                  by one of his contemporaries as 'a man who did picke out a way to thrive in grace,
                  and had much power of godliness to the fattening of lean churches.' He is also
                  mentioned as 'one who loved well Our New England Ordinances, and ever veered his
                  tongue against foreigne ladies, ape-headed pullets, and all fashions.' These
                  unprofitable classes of society he seems to have dosed with a composition the old
                  chronicler calls 'syrrope of reformation;' but his most famous exploits were
                  against the Indians, of whom it is related that' he did often lull as many as six
                  after supper, and was greatly disciplinated in grace.' It can hardly be surprising
                  that a gentleman of such singular accomplishment should have captivated the
                  affections of Dorcas Wherrie, the daughter of old Retribution Wherrie, who built
                  this house. I have never been able to ascertain any particulars concerning their
                  courtship; but the melancholy event that brought it to a conclusion is vividly
                  depicted by contemporaneous authority. It seems that poor Tolliwotte went out one
                  evening to take his customary diversion with the Indians—and promised to call upon
                  Dorcas on his way home. He <emph>did</emph> call; but the hapless lady never had
                  so unwelcome a visitor. In fact, the savages had at last got the better of him,
                  and he entered the house scalped (that was no great matter, for he wore a wig),
                  and pierced with several disagreeable instruments in several vital parts of his
                  body. He staggered about the hall for some time—just as we have heard those
                  mysterious boots do this evening—and finally fell with a crash—just such a crash,
                  Tom, as we heard when you opened the door—and lay bathed in blood at the feet of
                  his own Dorcas."</p>
               <p>My uncle paused for a moment, to give due effect to this dismal picture, and thus
                  continued:—</p>
               <p>"Ever since that day there has been a tradition in our family that the Colonel was
                  in the habit of returning to earth to rehearse the painful scene with which his
                  life terminated. Indeed, the truth of this story was placed beyond a doubt by the
                  testimony of my grandfather, who, upon returning one evening from a supper-party
                  at the<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7187-00000070"/> tavern, actually surprised the
                  Colonel, Miss Dorcas, and old Retribution, going through their affecting
                  exhibition in the front entry. Of late years, since the house has been more open
                  to the world, I regret to say that this interesting party have been forced to hold
                  their meetings in the attic, where they have much annoyed my cooks—who cannot be
                  made to understand the great privilege of entertaining such aristocratic company.
                  But the little event of this evening gives me good hopes that they have returned
                  to the original scene of their sufferings, and that they will continue to repeat
                  their satisfactory, though somewhat melancholy, performances every evening during
                  the season."</p>
               <p>"It seems strange," observed Barnard, "that these ghosts should always wish to go
                  over their most painful experiences when on earth. One would certainly suppose
                  that the Colonel would prefer to repeat the felicitous moment, when he arose from
                  his knees the accepted lover of Dorcas, or when he had the luck to bag a brace of
                  Indians at a shot. But this seems to be characteristic of all manifestations,
                  ancient and modern. I have seen mediums thrown into all sorts of convulsions to
                  represent the final moments of the spirits who professed to animate them."</p>
               <p>"I think it is almost sacrilege," said my uncle, "to mention these authentic and
                  respectable apparitions in the same breath with an imposture so transparent and
                  silly as modern spiritualism."</p>
               <p>"You speak like one who has not examined the matter, but is ready to take up the
                  cry of the street or press about a subject of which he is wholly uninformed,"
                  retorted Mr. Barnard. "Spiritualism may be, and in my opinion <emph>is,</emph> a
                  delusion; but an imposture it certainly is <emph>not.</emph> The alleged
                  phenomena, though in many cases exaggerated and distorted, do undoubtedly take
                  place. And we have no right to call our neighbor weak or silly, because his mind
                  is convinced by evidence that fails to satisfy our own. I am acquainted with many
                  spiritualists, as I am with many Catholics and Calvinists, whose peculiar tenets
                  of faith I can by no means accept, yet upon whose judgment and information in
                  indifferent matters I have the greatest reliance. Nay, more; I can feel the
                  highest respect for men who are brave enough to advocate what they conceive to be
                  the truth, undeterred by loss of social caste or the jeers and mockery with which
                  the world always receives those who seek its improvement in any novel or
                  unauthorized way."</p>
               <p>"Well! I shall hear of you as a confirmed believer in all these signs and wonders.
                  When people begin to talk <emph>so</emph> about it, they soon come boldly up to
                  the mark, and swallow any absurdity a diseased imagination can invent."</p>
               <p>"I will not say that I shall never be converted to spiritualism, because, with a
                  certain amount of evidence, I believe I could be converted to that, or anything
                  else. But I will say <emph>this</emph>—that after having carefully read every book
                  of any note devoted to the advocacy of the new revelation—after having done a
                  goodly amount of that "investigating" for which spiritualists clamor so loudly—I
                  am infinitely further <emph>from</emph> believing, than I was before beginning my
                  inquiries. And this is not because I have not seen many instances of that
                  clairvoyant thought-reading which must be accepted as an established fact,
                  but—Well, it is not worth while to detail all my reasons just now, and just here,
                  so they shall be kept for some long morning, when you ask for them."</p>
               <p>"It is very strange we have hot had the spirits here yet," said my Uncle. "They
                  had a great run at South<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7187-00000071"/> Wexford and
                  Ponkussett; but they seem to have skipped Bearbrook."</p>
               <p>"They will be upon you some time or other when you least expect them," rejoined
                  Barnard. "The whole town will be thrown into a state of furious excitement. People
                  will abandon their business and their pleasure and <emph>tip the tables</emph>
                  from morning to night. Doctor Drachma will preach a series of sermons against it,
                  and five or six families will become indignant and sell their pews. One or two
                  people may possibly become insane from over-excitement—and then the epidemic will
                  gradually pass off like the small-pox or yellow-fever, and the world will go on
                  very much as before. I have seen matters take precisely this course in more places
                  than one."</p>
               <p>"Well, well, all is, whenever we are favored, I shall expect you and Tom to come
                  down here. Your experience will be of infinite use in interrogating our
                  visitors."</p>
               <p>We both promised the Major that we would certainly come, and were about to
                  expatiate on the satisfaction we should take in such a visit, when my aunt, with
                  an exclamation of terror, called our attention to a mysterious
                     <emph>singing,</emph> that appeared to come from the cellar immediately beneath
                  us.</p>
               <p>"Doubtless it is one of the men chopping wood," said the Major.</p>
               <p>"It can be no <emph>man</emph>" exclaimed my aunt, "for I locked the cellar-door
                  and have the key in my pocket. I knew that John would be out to-night and did not
                  think it was best to leave it open."</p>
               <p>"It can surely be no ghost," said Barnard, "for I never heard of one who sang,
                  except the <foreign xml:lang="ITA">ombre di Nino</foreign> in Semiramide."</p>
               <p>"Be still a minute, and let us try to distinguish the words," urged the Major. "If
                  it has any connexion with the apparitions of this evening, it will doubtless be
                  some old Gregorian chant."</p>
               <p>"Du dar, du dar," sang the voice beneath; "I went to the race with a pocket full
                  of tin, but soon come back with my hat knocked in. Oh, du dar da."</p>
               <p>"Why, good gracious, it's old Netleswing," cried my aunt. "He must have been
                  locked up there all the afternoon. Why doesn't he knock to get out?"</p>
               <p>"Du dar, du dar," ascended in reply.</p>
               <p>"Somebody ought to go and let him up," said Kate—and she looked hard at me. "I'm
                  sure <emph>I</emph> can never go through that entry again!"</p>
               <p>"And I can never find the cellar-door alone," I responded. "Among all those queer,
                  dark passages that lead out of the kitchen, I should not discover the right one in
                  a twelvemonth."</p>
               <p>"Suppose we all go in a body," advised Barnard; "we shall then be able to defy
                  Tolliwotte, even if he brings all his Indians along with him."</p>
               <p>The Major thought the suggestion a good one, and volunteered to lead the forlorn
                  hope as bearer of the astral lamp. Barnard and myself marched as <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">aides-de-camp</foreign> to my aunt; and in this order we passed
                  into the entry.</p>
               <p>"I don't see any blood," said my uncle, pausing to examine the pattern of the
                  floor-cloth. "It would have been very satisfactory if Tolliwotte could have left a
                  few drops—just to show that it was really him."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps he is coming back to supply the omission," said Barnard. "There is
                  certainly a most extraordinary blowing and scraping at the other end of the
                  entry."</p>
               <p>We stood aghast as the mysterious sounds alluded to struck our ears; and my aunt
                  very nearly fainted, as a square portion of the floor a few feet from where we
                  stood rose from its place, and admitted a bushel basket of cranberries<pb
                     n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7187-00000072"/> berries into the hall. The cranberries
                  were followed by the head and shoulders of Mr. Netleswing, who was gradually
                  continued, until we surveyed a pair of cowhide boots, very similar to those
                  Colonel Tolliwotte must have had on during his last interview with Dorcas.</p>
               <p>"Well, now, who would ha' thought o' this?" said Netleswing, rather startled at
                  finding so many spectators to his ascent. "Why, Lord bless me, I thought you'd all
                  gone to lectur' and carr'd off the cellar key, so I've been tuggin' at this pesky
                  old trap-door that hasn't been used for mor'n twenty year, just to get at them
                  cranberries, that wanted pickin' over like all time. Cranberries, I s'pose you
                  know, Mr. Tom, when they're just a little mite touched and can't keep, is about
                  the most fattenin' thing for hogs there is a-going. Why, them sars'ges sent down
                  to you last November were made out o' cranberry-fed pork, and they were
                     <emph>just</emph>—well; I'll say they couldn't be beat, nohow!"</p>
               <p>The mysterious steps, the crash (possibly the trap-door as it descended over the
                  head of Mr. Netleswing), admit a certain sort of explanation. But if the reader is
                  willing to accept that explanation, and give up Dorcas and her lover, and old
                  Retribution, for Netleswing and a basket of cranberries—he is not the man I take
                  him to be. When Barnard attempted to account for the curious phenomena of the
                  evening in some such manner, we treated him with the contempt he deserved.</p>
               <p>A gentleman interested in spiritual literature borrowed my uncle's note-book, and
                  prepared and published an elaborate account of the whole matter; though I feel it
                  my duty to correct two slight errors that have crept into his otherwise authentic
                  narrative, by assuring the reader that at no period of the evening was the Major
                  sustained in the atmosphere, and that Barnard did <emph>not</emph> mount a table
                  ble, and gallop furiously about the room. In every other respect, I am most happy
                  to corroborate the little work in question, and so commend it to the perusal of
                  all candid inquirers.</p>

                  <p>PROFESSOR PHANTILLO was, and I presume still is, an astrologer. His
                     advertisements, which ornamented the newspapers a year ago, told the public in
                     what esteem he was held by the kings and potentates of the old world, who
                     consulted him on all important occasions with astonishing success. Why this
                     favorite of royalty should wish to establish himself in the shire-town of
                     Bearbrook in New England—or why his august disciples should suffer him to come,
                     if he did—were questions to which the advertisements aforementioned afforded no
                     response.</p>
                  <p>The particular service rendered by this illustrious stranger to my uncle, Major
                     Wherrey, being rather paternal than astrological in its character, need be
                     preceded by no inquiry concerning the claims of that occult science which yet
                     finds many dupes in the midst of our boasted enlightenment.</p>
                  <p>Now, my uncle, Major Wherrey, was a very thin gentleman, with queer little eyes
                     and still droller mouth—not at all like the engraving of the picture in
                     possession of the Bearbrook High Art Association, which serves (or should
                     serve) as frontispiece to the history. A constitutional shyness—or, as he chose
                     to call it, an elegant fastidiousness—prevented my uncle from relishing the
                     society of ladies; so that his forty-second birthday found him in celibacy, and
                     chambered in the city of New York.</p>
                  <p>Of the particular nature of the festivities that distinguished this annual
                     commemoration, I am unfortunately ignorant—never having been invited to assist
                     thereat; and, as the present narrative has only to do with facts, I decline
                     consulting my fancy, or even the doctrine of probabilities, for a sketch of the
                     occasion.</p>
                  <p>It is sufficient to conclude the introductory chapter (which, in my opinion,

                  <p>"The very thing, by Jove!" exclaimed my uncle, as he read an advertisement

                     after having perused this delicious publication. In their conservative pages,
                     he found the professors of the new art placed in the same category with the
                     proprietors of all-healing sarsaparillas or vegetable pills.</p>
                  <p>The short dream of a perfect restoration to all bodily and mental vigor—that
                     fair palace of perpetual health—that the brilliant novelist had conjured up,
                     was suddenly assailed by the harsh words, "humbug," "self-delusion,"
                     "quackery," and such other vituperative missives as the professional batteries
                     afforded.</p>
                  <p>Yet, in spite of the extravagant laudations of enthusiasts, and the vigorous
                     attacks of opponents, the establishments for the practice of the new system
                     have steadily increased among us; till the discovery of Priessnitz, with
                     certain modifications, is almost universally allowed to be of service in many
                     cases of chronic disorder.</p>
                  <p>It is hardly just, however, to attribute the number and thriving condition of
                     the hydropathic institutions by which we are surrounded, to the wonders wrought
                     by the simple agency of water. A great part of their success is doubtless owing
                     to the love of that easy, independent intercourse with one another, which
                     crowds Saratoga and Newport, and has made the "boarding-house" an American
                     institution. There is always an excuse for passing a few weeks at a water-cure,
                     which must be inconveniently stretched to apply to Fabiaria's, or the Mountain
                     House at Catskill, To the former we are driven, not by inclination, but
                     misfortune. A gentleman's business connections have no cause to complain—a
                     lady's household duties may with propriety be left to take care of
                     themselves—when the great necessity of health demand their absence.</p>
                  <p>There are other circumstances that make these establishments a favorite retreat
                     for a large class of our restless population. The moderate cost of such a
                     sojourn in some pleasant part of the country, in comparison with a visit to the
                     Lakes or Niagara—the complete absolution from the daily penance of
                     dressing—and, above all, the perfect equality in the state and position of each
                     occupant—are, to the great mass of migratory citizens, very positive
                     advantages.</p>
                  <p>"Why, the fact is," says young Wilkinson (he who lost so heavily a few years
                     ago, by the failure of a noted firm in this city), "the fact is, that at
                     Newport, where I formerly passed the season, I should now be positively nobody!
                     There are plenty of fellows whose kids and broadcloth, not to speak of
                     turn-outs, it would be impossible for me to equal; whereas, by going through
                     the water-cure, I can flourish and flirt in dressing-gown and slippers, and get
                     up quite as pleasant an understanding with a damsel in a calico morning-gown,
                     with hair damp and dishevelled by frequent ablutions, as if we were mutually
                     booted and laced in the most orthodox pattern,"</p>
                  <p>The recent visit of my uncle to one of the most famous of these establishments,
                     has given me a particularity of information concerning the details of
                     water-cure life, that, under other circumstances, could only be attained by a
                     personal residence. It has always been a habit of Major Wherrey to keep a daily
                     diary, to the end that should he by some unforeseen event blaze into notoriety,
                     there may not be wanting the materials for a biography sufficiently copious to
                     satisfy his warmest admirer. A great amount of blotted manuscript was recently
                     presented me by the good gentleman, accompanied by the same friendly permission
                     with which people who have been restored to health by some elixir or cordial,
                     conclude their certificates—namely, that they might be put to any use likely to
                     benefit the proprietor.</p>
                  <p>From these inky fountains, the stream of this narrative<pb n="148-149"
                        xml:id="VAC7187-00000075"/> derives its source—some tributaries may help to
                     increase its body—but the main supplies I here openly acknowledge.</p>

                  <p>A FAVORABLE, first impression is of acknowledged importance in reconciling us
                     to places or people.</p>
                  <p>In our younger days we may, indeed, recover from the shock of seeing a fine
                     view in a thunder-storm, or of failing to recognise some shabby little
                     gentleman as the favorite poet, whose intellectual visage had beamed at us from
                     the first page of his published productions. But in mature life, the loss of
                     impulse is supplied by the comparative duration of the feeling excited; and it
                     must be regarded as a happy circumstance when a middle-aged bachelor, an
                     imaginary or real invalid, on arriving at the place where he has idetermined to
                     make a considerable stay, discovers that matters are reasonably to his
                     liking.</p>
                  <p>Such a satisfaction did my uncle experience on reaching the Granville County
                     Water-Cure. The house, to be sure, had rather a patched effect, for nearly
                     every water-cure was originally designed for something else, and had been
                     through various processes of enlargement and adaptation. But the inside seemed
                     quiet and cheerful, and looked remarkably <emph>unlike</emph> a hotel. The
                     existence of any peculiar aquatic privileges would never have been suspected by
                     a transient visitor; for baths of every description were banished to the
                     cellar, where they kept company with an immense tank, whose calm dark surface
                     was strongly suggestive of mosquitoes.</p>
                  <p>Whether these annoying insects were actually generated in this lower region
                     could never be fully determined; but that they appeared upstairs in goodly
                     numbers, is a fact concerning which my uncle is peculiarly positive.</p>
                  <p>The chambers were small and low, as they must necessarily be where many are to
                     be accommodated—but the architect, with the view of providing a sufficiency of
                     oxygen, as well as mitigating the evils of solitude, placed ventilators over
                     all the doors, by which means my kinsman was kept pleasantly informed of the
                     affairs of his neighbors, and listened to many profitable strictures upon
                     himself.</p>
                  <p>It is not until the first breakfast that the stranger sees the full corps of
                     patients among whom he is to take his place. Then, they all enter fresh and
                     rosy from an early walk, where has been dispersed that silent misanthropy which
                     usually characterizes the first hour after rising.</p>
                  <p>There is certainly a republican mixture of the different varieties of the human
                     race. The pale and the florid, the fastidious and the gossiping, the judge, the
                     colonel, and the author, all mingle together as the black and white spirits are
                     instructed to do about the witches' cauldron. Among the ladies the variety is
                     no less striking. First, there is the pleasant, chatty little person, whose
                     toilet, manners, and conversation, may be described by the newspaper phrase,
                     "very neat." Opposite are several damsels of the intensely natural and
                     unaffected school. These are the young ladies who are afraid of nobody, despise
                     all sentiment, and can talk about fast horses and fancy drinks. Next, come,
                     some representatives of a different order, who manage to smile a little,
                     occasionally screw up their courage sufficiently to ask for the butter, and
                     secretly envy the ease and volubility of their neighbors. Besides these, there
                     is a dowager, who sparkles with breast-pins and showy rings, and a young lady
                     or two, who, not being patients, and consequently allowed to<pb n="150-151"
                        xml:id="VAC7187-00000076"/> rise when they please, steal to their places
                     with that guilty look that the consciousness of having overslept oneself
                     invariably occasions.</p>
                  <p>The breakfast itself is always plain, though exceedingly good; yet my uncle
                     sees fit to express his private distaste for a dark, husky mixture, which might
                     pass for the species of provender upon which the prodigal son was tempted to
                     regale in the hour of necessity, and which is handed about under the name of
                     "cracked wheat."</p>
                  <p>sFrom the memoranda made during the first few days of his sojourn, it is
                     conjectured that my uncle's visit began in a manner by no means disagreeable.
                     The day was spent in bathing and walking; and, until the walkers and bathers
                     had narrated the principal events in their past lives, and told when they had
                     come, and how long they meant to stay—there seems to have been little lack of
                     diversion.</p>
                  <p>The end of the week, however, brought with it the time that must come sooner or
                     later, when our companions began to repeat the same observations in the same
                     way, and we feel that consciousness of having seen to the bottom of one
                     another's minds, which Goldsmith urged as a good reason for admitting new
                     members to the Literary Club.</p>
                  <p>The "new members" in the present instance were not attainable—either the proper
                     season had not arrived, or the advertisements and billiard tables of rival
                     establishments succeeded in attracting the crowd. The daily routine seemed to
                     drag a little heavily, except when enlivened by some expedition, which, out of
                     the many talked about, happened actually to take place.</p>
                  <p>Of this description of entertainment the grand ascent of Squaticub Hill alone
                     deserves a notice.</p>
                  <p>A barouche, accompanied by several buggies, contained the pleasure-seekers. One
                     of these latter vehicles, and a very talkative young lady (who, to prevent
                     anything like embarrassment, at once informed her companion that she never
                     intended to be married), were bestowed upon my uncle. The prospect from various
                     parts of the road was said to be remarkably fine, and was, perhaps, enjoyed by
                     the proprietor of the fast horse; but the less favored individuals who were
                     enveloped in the dust occasioned by the performance of this favorite animal,
                     were obliged to rely on their imaginations for its various beauties. The fair
                     friend who took charge of Major Wherrey, was by no means of a careful or
                     timorous disposition, and insisted upon hurrying on at the greatest speed, in a
                     fruitless endeavor to obtain the lead. The result was, that, when at last the
                     summit of the hill was attained, my uncle's eyes were full of very fine gravel,
                     and his black broadcloth suit turned to that peppered-salt color, which the
                     tailors assure us makes up into "neat business-coats." Nor did the hue seem
                     particularly inappropriate to the party;—whose general appearance was more
                     suggestive of "business" than anything else—for how could it be supposed that
                        <emph>pleasure</emph> would induce people to climb a high hill, to sit in
                     the scorching rays of the sun, for the purpose of drinking wretched lemonade,
                     and looking at nothing in particular.</p>

                     addressing my uncle, after the author before mentioned had finished reading the
                     advertisement that stands at the head of this chapter—"what a capital chance
                     for some people to be sure—just think what fun to have everybody falling in
                     love with us."</p>
                  <p>Of course my uncle had the gallantry to suggest that any new acquirement would
                     be quite superfluous to a lady whose natural graces were fully able to insure
                     such a result.</p>
                  <p>At this Miss Kate Lawton (for by this name is the lady distinguished in the
                     diary) thought it necessary to state that she didn't like flattery, and
                     couldn't see why everybody so mistook her character as to be always saying such
                     sort of things; adding much more to the same purport, after the manner in which
                     people who are inordinately fond of hearing their own praises, really try to
                     persuade themselves that they don't like it.</p>
                  <p>"Well, well," observed Mr. Barnard, the reader of the advertisement, which he
                     continued still to study, "I would give something to know what this fellow
                     would say, if any one wrote to him."</p>
                  <p>"If somebody will write the letter for me, I declare I'll try," rejoined Miss
                     Kate.</p>
                  <p>"No difficult matter that," said the author; "if the doctor hadn't forbid using
                     my eyes in the evening, I'd do it myself; but here's the Major, who's just the
                     man; the letter may be written to-night, sent off the first thing in the
                     morning, and we shall have an answer by Wednesday."</p>
                  <p>It was only much discussion and a considerable biological influence which
                     streamed from the eyes of Miss Lawton, that reconciled my uncle to the plan;
                     and his assent was given in the midst of serious doubts concerning the
                     propriety of opening a correspondence with an individual who might make himself
                     as troublesome as the German professor. The <emph>assent,</emph> however, being
                     all that was wanted, the letter, by the joint inspirations of the trio, was
                     composed upon the spot, and was quite a model of deceptive composition.</p>
                  <p>It purported to be written by a certain Fanny Weston, who had been engaged to
                     one Smitkinson, a clerk in a jeweller's shop. This young gentleman (so ran the
                     tale) had basely broken his engagement, to contract another with Jane
                     Gossifant, daughter of old Mr. Gossifant, who lived by the church at South
                     Beckford, and had a comsumption and fifty thousand dollars.</p>
                  <p>The requisite sum was inclosed, and advice requested in this delicate case. But
                     an unexpected difficulty arose in determining the address to which the answer
                     should be sent. There was a necessity of making use of some real name, for, the
                     post-office being some miles off, the letters passed throguh the hands of an
                     agent, who would obviously<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7187-00000078"/> ly refuse
                     any epistle bearing a name unknown in the establishment. The author, on account
                     of his literary notoriety, declared <emph>he</emph> could not be thought of;
                     but that my uncle, being nobody in particular, could not reasonably object to
                     having the letter addressed to his care.</p>
                  <p>The Major, although willing to assent to the first proposition relating to
                     himself, could not easily be convinced of the second. The dispute waxed warm.
                     Mr. Barnard could not see the force of my uncle's objections, and the dark-eyed
                     young lady used those orbs to great effect, and only wished <emph>she</emph>
                     could do <emph>anything</emph> to oblige <emph>anybody.</emph> The result might
                     have been predicted. A postscript was added, directing the Professor to address
                     Miss F. Weston, care of Major Wherrey, at the —— Water-Care.</p>
                  <p>The letter was thoroughly sealed and deposited in a leathern bag which carried
                     the mail of the establishment to the nearest post-office; and my uncle retired
                     to bed with that dismal consciousness of having done something contrary to his
                     best judgment, that always prevented the enjoyment of peaceful repose.</p>
                  <p>During the three or four days that elapsed before the arrival of the letter
                     containing so much valuable information, a stage-load of people was added to
                     the guests. The slight scramble for seats at dinner, that usually succeeded
                     such advents, generally resulted in everybody finding himself next to just the
                     people whose society he would least have chosen. The exception, which is of
                     such value in establishing the general rule, was, in this instance, in favor of
                     my uncle. Happening to arrive rather late, he was driven in like a wedge
                     between two very nice young ladies, who agreeably shortened the tedious
                        <foreign xml:lang="FRA">entr'act</foreign> between the meal and the
                     dessert.</p>
                  <p>
                     <emph>A nice young lady!</emph> What reasonable-sized folio could contain the
                     different definitions of these simple words?</p>
                  <p>If some had their way, the candidates for this honorable degree would be
                     examined in polking and small talk—some would select such text-books as Childe
                     Harold and Corinne—while "Mrs. Farrar," and "Hints on Made Dishes," would be
                     considered by others as necessary as the Faculty of Harvard College consider
                     the grammars and readers of their own professors, to the proper preparation of
                     a Freshman.</p>
                  <p>As my uncle's opinion on this subject has the merit of being briefly expressed,
                     it shall be set down for what it is worth. According to this authority, the
                     title is deserved by any damsel who has learnt the great truth that perfect
                        <emph>simplicity</emph> is perfect <emph>elegance.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>The two ladies near whom my kinsman was placed, and with whom he appears to
                     have had considerable association, stood this test in a manner the most
                     satisfactory. They were city-bred, and held what is called "a position in
                     society"—advantages, by the way, that always make themselves evident in
                     feminine deportment and finish. It is customary to compare (greatly to the
                     advantage of the former) the good-tempered country girl with the indulged and
                     affected creatures with whom sarcastic writers choose to people the
                     drawing-rooms of the city. Now, there doubtless are many vulgar fellow-citizens
                     of ours, who, having risen to sudden wealth, and not to the real
                        <emph>position</emph> of dignity and intelligence, do conduct themselves
                     quite unworthily; but that these gentry comprise, or in any legitimate way
                     represent, the <emph>best society</emph> of our eastern cities, my uncle has
                     never been willing to allow.</p>

                  <p>THE remarks that concluded the last chapter, although having no connexion with
                     the story, may serve to indicate<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7187-00000079"/> the
                     time supposed to elapse before the arrival of the Professor's answer; just as a
                     drop-scene, representing a battle in Mexico, marks the interval between the
                     acts of a Roman tragedy.</p>
                  <p>The reader will now imagine the parlor of the establishment as it appeared on a
                     particularly sultry summer's evening. The windows are all open—the company
                     sufficiently mixed for everybody to serve as a restraint upon somebody else,
                     and the <emph>Dorr</emph>-bugs (I have no idea how they spell their name)
                     wrecking themselves against the ceiling, and thence tumbling upon the heads
                     beneath, until you could not help sympathizing with the Reverend Homer Wilbur
                     (in relation to a similar nuisance) in the doubt whether Noah <emph>could be
                        justified</emph> in preserving this species of insect.</p>
                  <p>A piano that was in the room, and a most obliging lady to officiate thereat,
                     redeemed parts of the evening; but the event that waked up everybody was the
                     entrance of Kate Lawton with a letter from Professor Phantillo.</p>
                  <p>It was read aloud at the request of many voices; but the contents were vague
                     and unsatisfactory. There was something concerning the position and influence
                     of the planets (which it seems were averse to any interposition just then,
                     though holding out good hopes for the future), a little concerning the
                     mysteries of love and courtship in general, and a great deal about a future
                     remittance of money. The interest of the communication, however, was reserved
                     for the postscript, which ran as follows:</p>
                  <p>"I desire some information concerning this Major Wherrey, to whose care this
                     letter is to be addressed. I discern that your fate is strangely connected with
                     his. I shall be glad to learn the amount of his property; also, whether he is
                     disposed to believe in the science which I profess. Not a word to
                        <emph>him</emph> of these inquiries; but answer me discreetly and secretly
                     and I will help you, to a fortune beyond your proudest hopes."</p>
                  <p>"Ha, ha, ha," laughed Mr. Barnard; "the Professor is completely taken in; he
                     evidently thinks that he has fallen upon a vein of metal that will pay the
                     working. Don't you see, Major, he means to inform himself about your property,
                     habits, etc., and then come down on you in some dexterous manner for a
                     remittance. Well, this is good! I'd no idea we should have such success!"</p>
                  <p>"Success!" exclaimed my uncle, starting from his seat; "yes! it's fine fun for
                     you—but consider the fellow knows my real name—he will be angry enough when he
                     discovers the hoax, and in some way or other will make me pay for it." And a
                     dismal diorama, representing respectable elderly gentlemen who had unwittingly
                     fallen into the power of some character whom they were obliged to furnish with
                     pocket-money forever after, unrolled itself before the mental vision of my
                     relative.</p>
                  <p>To be sure, Major Wherrey was unable to recollect that he had embezzled at the
                     bank, or ever entertained a passion for his cook; but his faith was strong in
                     the ability of his scientific friend to discover some point upon which to rest
                     the lever of persecution, should he be so disposed. Such dismal forebodings
                     were not shared by Miss Kate Lawton, who declared the letter quite worth the
                     two dollars it had cost, and was particularly diverted with the connexion
                     discovered between her destiny and anybody then at the water-cure.</p>
                  <p>Much more was said or sung (the latter by the lady at the piano) during the
                     evening; all which I would set down, if I "naturally ran to conversation." But,
                     not having the talent of Miss Burney for this, as well as one or two other
                     things, I think it best to keep up the sober jog of narration. And here let me
                     avow, what I have no<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7187-00000080"/> doubt the
                     reader has suspected all along, that the title of this paper, "a romance," is
                     altogether a misnomer. Yet, when I inscribed that taking substantive at the
                     head of my first chapter, I had no idea of asking a hearing under false
                     pretences. The note-books, which were mentioned as being in my possession, and
                     the singular sequel to the adventures they contain, seemed to me materials from
                     which an elegant structure of fiction might be reared, and I had actually the
                     temerity to draw a sketch for the ground-floor. But the strong solution of fact
                     with which my mind was filled, would precipitate itself upon the paper, till at
                     last the proposed embellishments of fancy were thrown aside, and I became a
                     chronicler of real experience, almost against my will.</p>
                  <p>Well! my uncle passed a hot, uncomfortable night. Hot!—yes; it <emph>was</emph>
                     hot indeed. You could almost cut the caloric with a knife. Everybody pretended
                     to go to bed, but speedily rose, and stumbled about the entries all night
                     Muttered execrations, combined with the notes of a distant musical box,
                     streamed through the ventilator, and pervaded my uncle's apartment, while
                     "friends in boots," stalked up and down the piazza before the window, with the
                     same interminable tramp.</p>
                  <p>Sleep was impossible for the most innocent or thoughtless during that long
                     night. Every half hour, or so, my uncle would go down cellar, and paddle about
                     the tank; which performance served to impart a more fiery sultriness to his
                     chamber, when he came out.</p>
                  <p>But the extreme discomfiture of his bodily state, was exceeded by the turbulent
                     nature of his mental speculations. One may dismiss a troublesome thought, or
                     suspicion, by day; but during a sleepless night, the unwelcome visitor returns,
                     and leers upon him horribly, and will not be exorcised. This waking nightmare
                     is far more terrible than anything dreams can furnish, and leaves us as weak
                     and miserable as was Sancho Panza, after the visit of the Enchanted Moors, at
                     the village inn.</p>
                  <p>In short, Major Wherrey, naturally nervous and timid, was goaded almost to
                     frenzy at the remembrance of his own indiscretion. At Bearbrook, too! that this
                     Professor Phantillo should live at Bearbrook, where my uncle's famous cranberry
                     plantation was situated, and where he himself resided several months in the
                     year! "Good heavens!" thought the poor gentleman, "what an opportunity it gives
                     him for raking together all sorts of scandal, for setting my neighbors against
                     me, and perhaps getting up some curious chemical blight for the
                     cranberries!"</p>
                  <p>Two letters, that were brought to my uncle's roqm the next morning, served to
                     plunge him into still deeper perplexity. The first was written on odd-looking
                     paper, was post-marked from Bearbrook, bore a strictly non-committal seal, and
                     turned out to be from Professor Phantillo himself. It was filled with dark
                     hints about secret information the Professor had received, which obliged him to
                     suppose that Major Wherrey had tampered with the affections of a certain Miss
                     Fanny Weston, and stated that unless the sum of twenty dollars was received by
                     the next post, he should feel it his duty to publish his suspicions in the
                        <title>Bearbrook Gazette.</title>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other epistle was from a nameless gentleman, connected with the New York
                     press, who politely forwarded a copy of an article that was to appear in the
                        <title>Criminal Investigator</title> of the next week.</p>
                  <p>Poor Major Wherrey was nearly beside himself at this palpable conspiracy. He
                     drove to the next town to consult a lawyer; and came back again to advise with
                     the doctor. He bewailed his fate with no gentle expletives touching himself,
                     the Professor, Miss Lawton, Mr. Barnard, and the<pb n="160-161"
                        xml:id="VAC7187-00000081"/> New York reporter. Finally, his trunks were
                     ordered, and he determined to fly from his tormentors.</p>
                  <p>There was no stage, however, before afternoon, and six or eight hours must be
                     endured before any one could leave the place. The obliging young lady played
                     the Wedding March upon the piano; but music had no charm to soothe the troubles
                     of my uncle. In a fit of impatient desperation, Major Wherrey seized a book
                     from the centre-table of the "boarders' parlor"—where the usual number were
                     collected to stare at each other, and wish away the morning—and hastily turned
                     over its leaves. It had the popular alliterative title, and, of course, had
                     sold to an almost mythical number of copies—at least, so said the
                     publishers.</p>
                  <p>"Harpoons and Hautboys, from Hatty's Haversack," repeated my uncle, as he
                     glanced over the title-page, and then with a start of recognition—'Miss Kate
                     Lawton, from her friend, T. Barnard." The start was occasioned by a remarkable
                     resemblance that Major Wherrey detected between the chirography of these latter
                     words and that of Professor Phantillo; nor was his astonishment lessened when
                     he observed, in the handwriting of the New York reporter, near the bottom of
                     the page, this expressive criticism—"A book just such as I like.—K. L."</p>
                  <p>Of course, my uncle's understanding received a sudden illumination from this
                     accidental discovery. Relieved from his apprehensions so unexpectedly, his
                     first impulse was to embrace his persecutors, as if they had done him some
                     distinguished favor; then came the revulsion of feeling, and the mortification
                     of having been successfully hoaxed—than which there are few things harder to
                     bear with equanimity.</p>
                  <p>He was, nevertheless, reminded by the lady and gentleman who had amused
                     themselves at his expense, of an opinion he had himself expressed upon the
                     allowability of a practical joke, when there was positively no other way of
                     getting rid of time—and the contempt with which he had dared anybody to take
                     him in—if they could.</p>
                  <p>As this reminiscence served to check the bitter complaints of which the Major
                     was about to deliver himself, he summoned sufficient discretion "to smooth his
                     cheek to smiles," and pretended to laugh at his own misfortune.</p>
                  <p>At any rate, his equanimity was completely restored when some whiskey, lemons,
                     and sugar, smuggled from the neighboring village, were mingled with the water
                     supplied so lavishly by the institution, and the door being locked, he sat with
                     Mr. Barnard enjoying the same after dinner.</p>
                  <p>"Well, sir," said my uncle, after the Professor's epistles had been duly
                     discussed, "so you sent the letters to Bear-brook to be post-marked; and all
                     that stuff about my fate being united with that of Miss Kate Lawton, and the
                     havoc I had made with her affections, was written by you!"</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Written</emph> by me—yes"—replied Mr. Barnard, "but
                        <emph>dictated</emph> by herself."</p>
               </div>

                  <p>AND now we have come to the last chapter, which, according to all rules and
                     precedents, should contain a wedding, or, at the very least, an engagement. I
                     have something of the kind to put into it, you may be sure, though it may not
                     prove of the most legitimate description.</p>
                  <p>In fact, had I persevered in my first idea, and made a<pb n="162-163"
                        xml:id="VAC7187-00000082"/> romance out of this matter, I should have
                     bestowed the hand of Miss Kate Lawton upon Signor Kwinsidi, the gentleman from
                     Norway, or Sir Harold Skiff, the English Baronet; both of whom, as I learn from
                     my uncle's diary, were sojourners at the establishment during his visit, and
                     appear to have been of person and years suitable for the manufacture of a
                     hero.</p>
                  <p>But, as I have determined to adhere to the real facts in the case, and tell,
                     not what Miss Kate could, would, or should have done, but what she actually did
                     do—I am compelled to declare that she is at present my aunt.</p>
                  <p>To make a lively young creature of three-and-twenty marry a somewhat infirm
                     gentleman of forty-two, even if he <emph>did</emph> have a fine house in the
                     country, and could keep his carriage in town, would, I admit, in any work of
                     fiction be utterly unnatural and preposterous. I can only urge, in palliation
                     of so original a finale, the excuse Ben Jonson once advanced for dispensing
                     with the graces of rhyme—that the fact stated happens to be <emph>true.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of course I was astonished at the engagement, and suspected the parties
                     immediately concerned must have been still more so. Yet, it is not difficult to
                     see how it happened. My uncle had never seen so much of any lady before, and no
                     lady had ever seemed so disposed to see a great deal of him. But, after all, it
                     is likely enough that the whole affair was determined upon and arranged soon
                     after Major Wherrey's arrival. "Here is a good-tempered gentleman, of handsome
                     fortune, who only wants a little encouragement, to take a wife to assist him in
                     spending it—and if so, why should not I, as well as any one else, profit by the
                     circumstance?" Mind,—I don't say that Miss Kate said or thought anything of the
                     kind; I only decline to peril the perfect authenticity of this history by
                     declaring that she did <emph>not.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>But however it came about, I am heartily glad that it did come about,
                     somehow—for a happier match was never lighted amid such watery surroundings.
                     Happy! yes, you would have thought so, had you been at Bearbrook last winter
                     during the session of the Court. Why, that great house was full of company, and
                     Major Wherrey, all smiles, was going about from one guest to another,
                     expatiating upon the excellence of his wife and his cranberries, and entreating
                     us all to make ourselves perfectly at home—for which every one thanked him
                     sincerely, and declared he would.</p>
                  <p>And, what is more, I believe we did it, too—only that nobody's <emph>real
                        home</emph> could have been half so amusing. You should have seen our
                     Bearbrook theatricals—not the performance of Love's Sacrifice: that, to be
                     sure, was a failure—but those two farces in which Aunt Catherine played the
                     chambermaid, and had fifteen bouquets thrown upon her by the delighted
                     audience. And then that good romping country ball, when the young lady who
                     "never meant to marry" found herself engaged to Sir Harold Skiff; and Mr.
                     Barnard sung that capital song after supper, and even Kwinsidi, the
                     imperturbable Norwegian, was stimulated into something like life. But, as the
                     reader did not see all this (that is, supposing he was not of the party), I can
                     only wish him better luck another time, and not try to anticipate his pleasure
                     by imperfect reminiscences.</p>
                  <p>In conclusion, then—but, stop:—before concluding, I wish to say a word to Mr.
                     Frank Osborne, whose history of "Wensley" I have just read with almost
                     unmingled satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>There exists in that work a passage highly commendatory of the "institution of
                     cousins," and, by implication, rather severe upon those who are slow to
                     appreciate the advantages of this blessed relationship; but, Mr. Osborne,<pb

                     pretty kinswoman, to whose luxurious mansion you were always welcomed, whom you
                     could drive, and read to, and take to the theatre, without the confounded
                     report of an engagement, and the shrugs and frowns of fathers and brothers—had
                     you found such a treasure at Wensley, should we not have read:—</p>

                  my own for disliking them!" said Parson Field to me, as we sat together, one
                  August noon, in the porch of his red house at Plainfield.</p>
               <p>"Do tell me, sir," said I, setting myself in an easy attitude to hear his
                  story—for a story from Parson Field was not to be despised—his quaint simplicity
                  bringing out, in old-time and expressive phrases, whatever he describes with the
                  clear fidelity of an interior by Mieris. "Do tell me," said I again, with a deeper
                  emphasis; whereat the old gentleman looked at me over his spectacles, and, smiling
                  benignantly into my eager face, began:</p>
               <p>"When I first came to Plainfield," said he, "more than thirty years ago, I had
                  been a minister of the Lord only ten years, and I had been settled for that period
                  of time in a large city, where I served acceptably to a worthy congregation; but
                  certain reasons of my own induced me to leave that situation, and come here to
                  live, where also I found acceptance, and not many months after I came there was a
                  considerable reviving of the work in this place, and many<pb n="166-167"
                     xml:id="VAC7187-00000084"/> believed. Of these was a certain Joseph Frazer, a
                  young Scotchman, concerning whom I felt much misgiving, lest he should take the
                  wrong path; but he, in due season, joined himself to the Church, and edified the
                  brethren in walk and conversation; so that, when he left Plainfield and settled in
                  the West Indies, we were loath to have him go.</p>
               <p>"Some years afterwards we heard he was married there to a lady of Spanish
                  extraction, and a Catholic; and, after ten years elapsed, she died, leaving him
                  one child, a daughter, eight years of age, and with her he came to Plainfield,
                  desiring that the child, whom he had named Adeline, after his own mother, should
                  have a New England training.</p>
               <p>"But, wonderful are the ways of Providence! On his return to Cuba, he perished in
                  the vessel, which went down in a heavy gale off Cape Hatteras; and when the news
                  came to his mother, old Mrs. Frazer, she sent for me that I should tell the child
                  Adeline, for she had given proofs of a singular nature, ardent and self-confident
                  in the extreme. I took my hat, and went over to Mrs. Frazer's with a very heavy
                  heart, for the grief of a child is a fearful thing to me, and to be the bringer of
                  evil tidings, that shall stain the pureness and calm of a child's thoughts with
                  the irreparable shadow of death, is no light thing, nor easily to be done. I
                  entered into the house one day in June; it was a very sweet day, and, as I walked
                  quietly into the low kitchen, I saw Adeline, with her head resting on her hands,
                  and her large eyes eagerly gazing out of the window at the gambols of a
                  scarlet-throated humming-bird. I went close to her, and thought to myself that I
                  would speak, but I did not, for I saw that in her little pale face which made me
                  more sad than before; and I had it on my lips to say, 'Adeline, are you homesick?'
                  (which was the thing of all others I should not say) when suddenly she turned
                  about, and answered the question before I spoke it.</p>
               <p>"'Sir,' said she, 'I wish I was in Cuba. I had just such a humming-bird at home;
                  and I fed it with orange boughs full of white flowers, every day; but you have no
                  orange trees here, and I have no papa!'</p>
               <p>"It seemed to me that the child's angel had thus opened the way for me to speak,
                  and I began to say some things about the love of our universal Father, when she
                  laid her little hand on my arm with a fearfully strong pressure. 'Mr. Field,' said
                  she, 'is my papa dead?' I never shall forget the eyes that looked that question
                  into mine. I felt like an unveiled spirit before their eager, piercing stare. I
                  did not answer except by a strong quiver of feeling that would run over my
                  features, for I loved her father even as a kinsman, and I needed to say nothing
                  more, for the child fell at my feet quite rigid, and I called Mrs. Frazer, who
                  tried all her nurse-arts to restore little Adeline; but was forced, at last, to
                  send for a physician, who bled the child, and brought her round.</p>
               <p>"In the meantime I had gone home to prepare my sermon, for it was not yet
                  finished, and the day was Friday; but I kept seeing that little lifeless face, all
                  orphaned as it was, and the Scripture, 'As one whom his mother comforteth,' was so
                  borne in upon my mind, that, although I had previously fixed upon one adapted to a
                  setting forth of the doctrine of election, I was wrought upon to make the other
                  the subject of my discourse: and truly, the people wept; almost all but Adeline,
                  who sat in the square pew with her great eyes fixed upon me, and her small lips
                  apart, like one who drinks from the stream of a rock.</p>
               <p>"The next day I was resting, as my custom is, after the Sabbath; and in a warm,
                  fair day, I find no better rest than to sit by the open window, and breathe the
                     summer<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7187-00000085"/> air, and fill my eyes and
                  heart with the innumerable love-tokens that God hath set thickly in Nature. I was,
                  therefore, at my usual place, rapt in thought, and beholding the labors of a small
                  bird which taught her young to fly, when I felt a light, cold touch, and, turning,
                  saw little Adeline beside me. 'Sir,' said she, without any preface, 'when my papa
                  went away he left with me a letter, which he said I was to give you if he died.'
                  So far she spoke steadily, but there the small voice quivered and broke down. I
                  took the letter she proffered me, and, breaking the seal, found it a short but
                  touching appeal to me, as the spiritual father of Joseph Frazer, to take his own
                  child under my care, and be as a father to her, inasmuch as his mother was old and
                  feeble, and also to be executor of his will, of which a copy was inclosed. I said
                  this much to the child as shortly as I could, and with her grave voice she
                  replied, 'Sir, I should like to be your little girl, if you will preach me some
                  more sermons.' Now I was affected at this answer; not the less that the leaven of
                  pride, which worketh in every man, was fed by even a baby's praise; and, putting
                  on my hat, I walked over to Mrs. Frazer's house and laid the matter before her.
                  She was not, at first, willing to give up Adeline; but at length, after much
                  converse to and fro, she came to my conclusion, that the child would be better in
                  my hands, inasmuch as she herself could not hope for a long continuance: and, as
                  it was ordered, she died the next summer. I sent for my sister Martha, who was
                  somewhat past marriageable years, but kind and good, to come and keep house for
                  me, and from that time Adeline was as my own child. But I must hasten over a time,
                  for I am too long in telling this.</p>
               <p>"In course of years the child grew up, tall and slender, of a very stately
                  carriage, and having that scriptural glory of a woman, long and abundant hair.</p>
               <p>"She was still very fervid in her feelings, but reserved and proud; and I fear I
                  had been too tender with her for her good, inasmuch as she thought her own will
                  and pleasure must always be fulfilled, and we all know that is not one of the
                  ordinations of Providence.</p>
               <p>"As Adeline came to be a woman, divers youths of my congregation were given to
                  call of a Sabbath night, with red apples for me, and redder cheeks for Adeline,
                  who was scarcely civil to them, and often left them to my conversation, which they
                  seemed not to relish so much as would have been pleasing to human nature.</p>
               <p>"But my sainted mother, who was not wanting in the wisdom of this world, was used
                  to say that every man and woman had their time of crying for the moon; and while
                  some knew it to be a burning fire, and others scornfully called it cheese, and if
                  they got it, either burned their fingers, or despised their desire, still all
                  generations must have their turn; and truly, I believed it, when I found that
                  Adeline herself began to have a pining for something which I could not persuade
                  her to specify. The child grew thin and pale, and ceased the singing of psalms at
                  her daily task, and I could not devise what should be done for her; though Martha
                  strongly recommended certain herb teas, which Adeline somewhat unreasonably
                  rebelled against. However, about this time, my attention was a little turned from
                  her, as there was much religious awakening in the place, and among others, whom
                  the deacons singled out as special objects of attention, was one John Henderson, a
                  frequent visitor at our house, and a young man of good parts and kindly feeling,
                  as it seemed, but of a peculiar nature, being easily led into either right or
                  wrong, yet still given to fits of stubbornness, when he could not be drawn, so to
                  speak, with a cart-rope.</p>
               <p>"Now Adeline had been a professor of religion for some<pb n="170-171"
                     xml:id="VAC7187-00000086"/> years, but it did not seem to me that she took a
                  right view of this particular season, for many times she refused to go to the
                  prayer-meetings, even to those which were held with special intentions towards the
                  unconverted; and many times, on my return, I found her with pale cheeks and red
                  eyes, evidently from tears. About this time, also, she began to take long,
                  solitary walks, from which she returned with her hands full of wild flowers, for
                  it was now early spring; but she cared nothing for the flowers, and would scatter
                  them about the house to fade, without a thought. In the meantime, the revival
                  progressed, but, I lament to say, with no visible change in John Henderson. He had
                  gotten into one of his stubborn moods of mind, and neither heaven nor, hell seemed
                  to affect him. The only softening I could perceive in the young man was during the
                  singing of hymns, which was well done In our meeting-house, for Adeline led the
                  choir, and I noticed that, whenever that part of the exercises began, John
                  Henderson would lift up his head, and a strange color and tender expression seemed
                  to melt the hard lines of his face.</p>
               <p>"Somewhere about the latter end of April, as I was returning from a visit to a
                  sick man, I met John coming from a piece of woods, that lay behind my house about
                  a mile, with his hands full of liverwort blossoms. I do not know why this little
                  circumstance gave me comfort, yet, I have ever observed, that a man who loves the
                  manifestations of God in His works is more likely to be led into religion than a
                  brutal or mere business man; so I was desirous of speaking to the youth, but when
                  he saw me he turned from the straight path, and, like an evil-doer, fled across
                  the fields another way. I did not call after him, for some experience has
                  constrained me to think that there is no little wisdom in sometimes letting people
                  alone; but I took my own way home, and, having put on my cloth shoes to ease my
                  feet, and being in somewhat of a maze of thought, I went up to my study, as it
                  seemed, very quietly, for I entered at the open door and found Adeline sitting in
                  my arm-chair by the window, quite unaware of my nearness. I well remember how like
                  a spirit she looked that day, with her great eyes raised to a cloud that rested in
                  the bright sky, her soft black hair twisted into a crown about her head, and her
                  light dress falling all over the chair, while in her hands, lying between the
                  slight fingers, and by the bluer veins, was clasped a bunch of liverwort blossoms.
                  Then I perceived, for the first time, why my child was crying for the moon, and
                  that John Henderson cared for the singing and not for the hymns, at which I
                  sorrowed. But I sat down by Ada, and taking the flowers out of her cold hands,
                  began to say that I had met John Henderson on the road with some such blossoms, at
                  which she looked at me even as she did when I told her about her father, and,
                  seeing that I smiled, and yet was not dry-eyed, nor quite at rest, the tears began
                  slowly to run over her eyelashes, and in a few very resolute words she told me
                  that Mr. Henderson had asked her that morning to marry him.</p>
               <p>"Now I knew not well what to say, but I set myself aside, as far as I could, and
                  tried not to remember how sore a trial it would be to part with Ada, and I
                  reasoned with her calmly about the youth, setting forth, first, that he was not a
                  professing Christian, and that the Scripture seemed plain to me on that matter,
                  though I would not constrain her conscience if she found it clear in this thing;
                  and, second, that he was a man who held fast to this world's goods, and was like
                  to be a follower of Mammon if he learned not love better things in his youth; and,
                  third, that he was a man who had, as one might say, a streak of granite in his
                  nature, against which a feeling person would<pb n="172-173"
                     xml:id="VAC7187-00000087"/> continually fall and be hurt, and which no person
                  could work upon, if once it came in the way even of right action. To all this
                  Adeline answered with more reason than I supposed a woman could, only that I
                  noticed, at the end of each answer, she said in a low voice, as if it were the end
                  of all contention,—'and I love him.' Whereby, seeing that the thing was well past
                  my interference, I gave my consent with many doubts and fears in my heart, and
                  having blessed the child, I sent her away that I might meditate over this
                  matter.</p>
               <p>"When John came in the evening for his answer, I was enabled to exhort him
                  faithfully, and, in his softened state of feeling, he chose to tell me that he had
                  been seeking religion because he feared I would not give him Adeline unless he
                  would join the Church, and he could not make a hypocrite of himself, even for
                  that, but he had hoped that in the use of means he might be awakened and
                  converted. At this I was pleased, inasmuch as it showed a spirit of truth in the
                  young man, but I could not avoid setting before him that self-seeking had never
                  led any soul to God, and how cogent a reason he had himself given for his want of
                  success in things pertaining to his salvation; but as I spoke Ada came in by the
                  other door, and John's eyes began to wander so visibly, that I thought it best to
                  conclude, and I must say he appeared grateful. So I went out of the door, leaving
                  Ada stately and blushing as a fair rose-tree, notwithstanding that John Henderson
                  seemed to fancy she needed his support.</p>
               <p>"As the year went on, and I could not in conscience let Adeline leave me until her
                  lover had some fixed maintenance, I had many conversations with him (for he also
                  was an orphan), and it was at length decided that he should buy, with Ada's
                  portion, a goodly farm in Western New York; and in the ensuing summer, after a
                  year's engagement ment, they were to marry. So the summer came; I know not exactly
                  what month was fixed for their marriage, though I have the date somewhere, but one
                  thing I recollect, that the hop-vine over this porch was in full bloom, and after
                  I had joined my child and the youth in the bands of wedlock, I went out into the
                  porch to see them safe into the carriage that was to take them to the boat, and
                  there Ada put her arms about my neck, and kissed me for good-by, leaving a hot
                  tear upon my cheek; and a south wind at that moment smote the hop-vine so that its
                  odor of honey and bitterness mingled swept across my face, and always afterwards
                  this scent made me think of Adeline. After two years had passed away, during which
                  we heard from her often, we heard that she had a little daughter born, and her
                  letters were full of joy and pride, so that I trembled for the child's spiritual
                  state; but after some three years the little girl, with her mother, came to
                  Plainfield, and I did not know but Adeline was excusable in her joy, for such a
                  fair and bright child was scarcely ever seen; but the next summer came sad news:
                  little Nelly was dead, and Ada's grief seemed inexhaustible, while her husband
                  fell into one of his sullen states of mind, and the affliction passed over them to
                  no good end, as it seemed.</p>
               <p>"Soon after this the Mormon delusion began to spread rapidly about John
                  Henderson's dwelling-place, and in less than a year after Nelly's death I had a
                  letter from Ada, dated at St. Louis, which I will read to you, for I have it in my
                  pocket-book, having retained it there since yesterday, when I took it out from the
                  desk to consult a date.</p>

                           <p>"It begins:—'Dear Uncle' (I had always instructed the child so to call
                              me, rather than father, seeing we can have but one father, while we
                              may be blessed with numerous uncles), 'I suppose you will wonder how I
                              came to be at St. Louis, and it is just my being here that I write<pb
                                 n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7187-00000088"/> to explain. You know how my
                              husband felt about Nelly's death, but you cannot know how I felt; for,
                              even in my very great sorrow, I hoped all the time, that by her death,
                              John might be led to a love of religion. He was very unhappy, but he
                              would not show it, only that he took even more tender care of me than
                              before. I have always been his darling and pride; he never let me
                              work, because he said it spoiled my hands; but after Nelly died, he
                              was hardly willing I should breathe; and though he never spoke of her,
                              or seemed to feel her loss, yet I have heard him whisper her name in
                              his sleep, and every morning his hair and pillow were damp with
                              crying; but he never knew I saw it. After a few months, there came a
                              Mormon preacher into our neighborhood, a man of a great deal of talent
                              and earnestness, and a firm believer in the revelation to Joseph
                              Smith. At first my husband did not take any notice of him, and then he
                              laughed at him for being a believer in what seemed like nonsense; but
                              one night he was persuaded to go and hear Brother Marvin preach in the
                              school-house, and he came home with a very sober face. I said nothing,
                              but when I found there was to be a meeting the next night, I asked to
                              go with him, and, to my surprise, I heard a most powerful and exciting
                              discourse, not wanting in either sense or feeling, though rather poor
                              as to argument; but I was not surprised that John wanted to hear more,
                              nor that, in the course of a few weeks, he avowed himself a Mormon,
                              and was received publicly into the sect Dear Uncle, you will be
                              shocked, I know, and you will wonder why I did not use my influence
                              over my husband, to keep him from this delusion; but you do not know
                              how much I have longed and prayed for his conversion to a religious
                              life; until any religion, even one full of errors, seemed to me better
                              than the hardened and listless state of his mind.</p>
                           <p>"'I could not but feel, that if he were awakened to a sense of the
                              life to come, in any way, his own good sense would lead him right in
                              the end: and there is so much ardor and faith about this strange
                              belief, that I do not regret his having fallen in with it, for I think
                              the true burning of Gospel faith will yet be kindled by means of this
                              strange fire. In the meantime he is very eager and full of zeal for
                              the cause, so much so, that thinking it to be his duty, he resolved to
                              sell our farm at Oakwood, and remove to Utah. If anything could make
                              me grieve over a change I believe to be for John's spiritual good, it
                              would be this idea; but no regret or sorrow of mine shall ever stand
                              in the way of his soul; so I gave as cheerful a consent as I could to
                              the sale, and I only cried a few tears over little Nelly's bed, under
                              the great tulip-tree. There my husband has put an iron railing, and I
                              have planted a great many sweetbrier vines over the rock; and Mr.
                              Keeney, who bought the farm, has promised that the spot shall be kept
                              free from weeds, so I leave her in peace. Do write to me, Uncle Field.
                              I feel sure I have done right, because it has not been in my own way,
                              yet sometimes I am almost afraid. I shall be very far away from you,
                              and from home, and my child; but I am so glad now she is in heaven,
                              nothing can trouble her, and I shall not care much about myself, if
                              John goes right.</p>
                           <p>"'Give my love to Aunt Martha, and please write to your dear

               <p>"I need not say, my young friend," resumed Parson Field, wiping his. spectacles,
                  and clearing his voice with a vigorous ahem!! "that I could not, in conscience,
                  approve of Adeline's course. 'Thou shalt not do evil that good may come,' is a
                  Gospel truth, and cannot be transgressed<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7187-00000089"
                  /> with good consequences. I did write to Ada; but, inasmuch as the act was done,
                  I said not much concerning it, but bade her take courage, seeing that she had
                  meant to do right, although in the deed she had considered John Henderson before
                  anything else, which was, as you may perceive, her besetting sin, and therefore it
                  seemed good to me to put at the end of my epistle (as I was wont always to offer a
                  suitable text of Scripture for her meditation) these words, 'Little children, keep
                  yourselves from idols!' I did not hear again from Adeline, till she had been two
                  months in the Mormon city, and though she tried her best to seem contented and
                  peaceful, in view of John's new zeal, and his tender care of her, still I could
                  not but think of the hop-blossoms, for I perceived underneath this pleasant
                  sweetness, a little drop of life and pain working to some unseen end. That year
                  passed away and we heard no more, and the next also, at which I wondered much;
                  but, reflecting on the chances of travel across those deserts, and having a surety
                  of Ada's affection for me, I did not repine, though I felt some regret that there
                  was such uncertainty of carriage; nevertheless, I wrote as usual that no chance
                  might be lost.</p>
               <p>"The third summer was unusually warm in our parts, and its heats following upon a
                  long, wet spring, caused much and grievous sickness, and I was obliged to be out
                  at all hours with the dying, and at funerals, so that my bodily strength was
                  well-nigh exhausted, and at haying-time, just as I was cutting the last swath on
                  my river meadow, which is low-lying land, and steamed with hot vapor as I laid it
                  bare to the sun, I fell forward across my scythe-snath and fainted. This was the
                  beginning of a long course of fever, of a typhoid character, during which I was
                  either stupid or delirious most of the time; and, while I lay sick, there came a
                  letter to me from Salt Lake City, written chiefly by John Henderson, who begged me
                  to come on, if it was a possible thing and see his wife, who was wasting with a
                  slow consumption, and much bent upon seeing me. I could discern that the letter
                  was not willingly written; it was stiff in speech, though writ with a trembling
                  hand. At the end of it were a few lines from Ada herself; a very impatient and
                  absolute cry for me, as if she could not die till I came. Now Martha had opened
                  this letter, as she was forced to by my great illness, and, having read it, asked
                  the doctor if it was well to propound the contents to me, and he said decidedly
                  that he could not answer for my life if she did: so Martha, like a considerate
                  woman, wrote an answer herself to John Henderson (of which she kept a copy for me
                  to see), setting forth that I was in no state to be moved with such tidings; that,
                  however, I should have the letter as soon as the doctor saw fit, and sending her
                  love and sympathy to Ada, and a recommend that she should try balm tea.</p>
               <p>"After a long season of suspense, I was graciously uplifted from fever, and
                  enabled to leave my bed for a few hours daily; and when I could ride out, which
                  was only by the latter end of October, I was given the child's letter, and my
                  heart sunk within me, for I knew how bitterly she had needed my strength to help
                  her. It was a warm autumn day, near to noon, when I read that letter, and, as I
                  leaned back in my chair, the red sunshine came in upon me, and the smell of dead
                  leaves; while upon the hop-vine one late blossom, spared by the white frosts, and
                  dropping across the window, also put forth its scent, bringing Adeline, as it
                  were, right back into my arms, and the faintness passed away from me with some
                  tears, for I was weak, and a man may not always be stronger than his nature. Now,
                  when Martha sounded the horn for dinner, and our hired man came in from the hill
                  lot, where he was<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7187-00000090"/> sowing wheat, I saw
                  that he had a letter in his hand of great size and thickness; and, coming into the
                  keeping-room where I sat, he said that Squire White had brought it over from the
                  post-office as he came along, thinking I would like to have it directly. I was
                  rather loath to open the great packet at first, for I bethought myself it was
                  likely to be some Consociation proceedings, which were never otherwise than
                  irksome to me, and were now weary to think of, seeing the grasshopper had become a
                  burden. I reached my spectacles down from the nail, and found the post-mark to be
                  that of the Mormon city; and with unsteady hand I opened the seal, and found
                  within several sheets of written letter-paper, directed to me in Ada's writing,
                  and a short letter from John Henderson, which ran thus:</p>

                              sixth of July, at my house, in the city of Great Salt Lake. Shortly
                              before dying she called upon me, in the presence of two sisters, and
                              one of the saints, to deliver into your hands the inclosed packet, and
                              tell you of her death. According to her wish I send the papers by
                              mail; and, hoping you may yet be called to be a partaker in the faith
                              of the saints below, I remain your afflicted, yet rejoicing
                              friend,</p>

               <p>"I was really stunned for a moment, my young friend, not only with grief at my own
                  loss, but with pity and surprise at the entire deadening, as it appeared, of
                  natural affection in the man to whom I had given my daughter; and also my
                  conscience was not free from offence, for I could not but think that a more
                  fervent and wrestling expostulation, on the sin of marrying an unbeliever, might
                  have saved Adeline from sorrow in the flesh. However, I said as much as seemed
                  best at the time, and upon that reflection I rested myself; for he who adheres to
                  a pure intention, need not repent of his deeds afterwards; and the next day, when
                  my present anguish and weakness had somewhat abated, I read the manuscript Ada had
                  sent me.</p>
               <p>"It was, doubtless, penned with much reluctance, for the child's natural pride was
                  great, and no less weighty subject than her husband's salvation could have forced
                  her to speak of what she wrote to me; and, indeed, I should feel no right to put
                  the confidence into your hands, were not my child beyond the reach of man's
                  judgment, and did I not feel it a sacred duty to protest, so long as life lasts,
                  against this abominable Mormon delusion, and the no less delusive pretext of doing
                  evil that good may come. I cannot read Ada's letter aloud to you, for there is to
                  be a funeral at two o'clock, which I must attend; but I will give you the papers,
                  and you may sit in my chair and read; only be patient with my bees, if they come
                  too near you, for they like the hop-blossoms, and never sting unless you
                  strike."</p>
               <p>So saying, Parson Field gave me his leathern chair and the papers, and I sat down
                  in the hop-crowned porch, to read Adeline Henderson's story, with a sort of
                  reverence for her that prompted me to turn the rustling pages carefully, and feel
                  startled if a door swung to in the quiet house, as if I were eaves-dropping; but
                  soon I ceased to hear, absorbed in her letter, which began as the first did.</p>

                           <p>"To-day I begged John to write, and ask you to come here. I could not
                              write you since I came here but that<pb n="180-181"
                                 xml:id="VAC7187-00000091"/> once, though your letters have been my
                              great comfort, and I added a few words of entreaty to his, because I
                              am dying, and it seems as if I must see you before I die; yet I fear
                              the letter may not reach you, or you maybe sick; and for that reason I
                              write now, to tell you how terrible a necessity urged me to persuade
                              you to such a journey. I can write but little at a time, my side is so
                              painful; they call it slow-consumption here, but I know better; the
                              heart within me is turned to stone. I felt it then—. Ah! you see my
                              mind wandered in that last line; it still will return to the old
                              theme, like a fugue tune, such as we had in the Plainfield
                              singing-school. I remember one that went, 'The Lord is just, is just,
                              is just'—Is He? Dear Uncle, I must begin at the beginning, or you
                              never will know. I wrote you from St. Louis, did I not? I meant to.
                              From there, we had a dreary journey, not so bad to Fort Leaven-worth,
                              but after that inexpressibly dreary, and set with tokens of the dead,
                              who perished before us. A long reach of prairie, day after day, and
                              night after night; grass, and sky, and graves; grass, and sky, and
                              graves; till I hardly knew whether the life I dragged along was life
                              or death, as the thirsty, feverish days wore on into the awful and
                              breathless nights, when every creature was dead asleep, and the very
                              stars in heaven grew dim in the hot, sleepy air—dreadful days! I was
                              too glad to see that bitter in land sea, blue as the fresh lakes, with
                              its gray islands of bare rock, and sparkling sand shores; still more
                              rejoiced to come upon the city itself, the rows of quaint, bare
                              houses, and such cool water-sources, and, over all, near enough to
                              rest both eyes and heart, the sun-lit mountains, 'the shadow of a
                              great rock in a weary land.'</p>
                           <p>"I liked my new house well. It was too large for our need, but
                              pleasanter for its airiness, and the first thing I did, was to plant a
                              little hop-vine, that I had brought all the way with such great care
                              by the east porch. I wanted something like Plainfield in my home. I
                              don't know why I linger so. I must write faster, for I grow weak all
                              the time.</p>
                           <p>"I liked the city very well for awhile; the neighbors were kind, and
                              John more than that. I could not be unhappy with him—I thought. We had
                              a pretty garden, for another man had owned the house before us, and we
                              had not to begin everything. Our next-door neighbor, Mrs. Colton, was
                              good and kind to me; so was her daughter Lizzy, a pretty girl, with
                              fair hair, very fair. I wonder John liked it after mine. The first
                              great shock I had was at a Mormon meeting. I cannot very well remember
                              the ceremony, because I grew so faint; but I would not faint away lest
                              some one should see me. I only remember that it was Mrs. Colton's
                              husband with another wife being "sealed" to him, as they say here. You
                              don't know what that means, Uncle Field; it is one part of this
                              religion of Satan, that any man may have, if he will, three or four
                              wives, perhaps more. I only know that shameless man, with grown
                              daughters, and the hair on his head snow-white, has taken two, and his
                              own wife, a firm believer in this—faith! looks on calmly, and lives
                              with them in peace. I know that, and my soul sickened with disgust,
                              but I did not fear; not a thought, not a dream, not a shadow of fear
                              crossed me. I should have despised myself for ever if the idea had
                              stained my soul; my husband was <emph>my</emph> husband,—mine—before
                              God and man! and our child was in heaven; how glad I was she could
                              never be a Mormon.!</p>
                           <p>"I was sorry for Mrs. Colton, though she did not need it, and when I
                              saw John leaning over their gate, or smoking in the porch with the old
                              man, I thought he felt so, too, and I was glad to see him more
                              sociable than ever he was in the States. After awhile he did not
                              smoke, but talked<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7187-00000092"/> with
                              Elder Colton, and then would come home and expound out of the book of
                              Mormon to me. I was very glad to have him earnest in his religion, but
                              I could not be. Then be grew very thoughtful, and had a silent fit,
                              but I took no notice of it, though I think now he meant to leave me,
                              but I began to pine a little for home, and when I worked in the
                              garden, and trained the vines about our veranda, I used to wish he
                              would help me as he did Lizzy Colton, but I still remembered how good
                              he was to pity and help them.</p>
                           <p>"Oh, fool! yet, I had rather be a fool over again, than have
                              imagined—that I am glad of, even now—I did not once suspect.</p>
                           <p>"But one day—I remember every little thing in that day—even the slow
                              ticking of the clock, as I tied up my hop-vine; and after that I went
                              into the garden, and sat down on a little bench under the
                              grape-trellis, and looked at the mountains. How beautiful they were!
                              all purple in the shadow of sunset, and the sky golden green above
                              them, with one scarlet cloud floating slowly upwards: I hope I shall
                              never see a red cloud again. Presently, John came and sat by me, and I
                              laid my head on his shoulder; I was so glad to have him there—it cured
                              my homesickness; once or twice he began to say something, and stopped,
                              but I did not mind it. I wanted him to see a low line of mist creeping
                              down a canon in the mountains, and I stood up to point it out; so he
                              rose, too, and in a strange, hurried way, began to say something about
                              the Mormon faith, and the duties of a believer, which I did not notice
                              either very much—I was so full of admiring the scarlet cloud—when,
                              like a sudden thunder-clap to my ear, I heard this quick, resolute
                              sentence: 'And so, according to the advice and best judgment of the
                              Saints, Elizabeth Colton will be sealed to me, after two days, as my
                              spiritual wife.'</p>
                           <p>"Then my soul fled out of my lips, in one try—I was dead—my heart
                              turned to a stone, and nothing can melt it. I did not speak, or sigh,
                              but sat down on the bench, and John talked a great deal; I think he
                              rubbed my hands, and kissed me, but I did not feel it. I went away,
                              by-and-by, when it was dark, into the house and into my room. I locked
                              the door and looked at the wall till morning, then I went down and sat
                              in a chair till night; and I drank, drank, drank, like a fever. All
                              the time cold water, but it never reached my thirst. John came home,
                              but he did not dare touch me; I was a dead corpse, with another spirit
                              in it—not his wife—she was dead, and gone to heaven on a bright cloud.
                              I remember being glad of that.</p>
                           <p>"In two days more he had a wife, and I was not his any longer. I
                              stayed upstairs when he was in the house, and locked my door, till,
                              after a great many days, I began to feel sorry for him. Oh! how sorry!
                              for I knew—I know—he will see himself some day with my eyes, but not
                              till I die. Then I found my lips full of blood one morning, and that
                              pleased me, for I knew it was a promise of the life to come; now I
                              shall go to heaven where there aren't any Mormons.</p>
                           <p>"I believe, though, people were kind to me all the time; for I
                              remember they came and said things to me, and one shook me a little to
                              see if I felt; and one woman cried. I was glad of that, for I couldn't
                              cry. However, after three months I was better: worse, John said one
                              day, and he brought a doctor, but the man knew as well as I did—so he
                              said nothing at all, and gave me some herb tea;—tell Aunt Martha
                              that.</p>
                           <p>"Then I could walk out of doors, but I did not care to; only once I
                              smelt the hop-blossoms, and that I could not bear, so I went out and
                              pulled up my hop-vine by the roots, and laid it out, all straight, in
                              the fierce sunshine; it died<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7187-00000093"
                              /> directly. In the winter John had another wife sealed to him; I
                              heard somebody say so; he did not tell me, and if he had I could not
                              help it. I found he had taken a little adobe house for those two, and
                              I knew it was out of tenderness for my feelings he did so. Oh! Uncle
                              Field, perhaps he has loved me all this time? I know better, though,
                              than that! Spring came, and I was very weak, and I grew not to care
                              about anything; so I told John he could bring those two women to this
                              house if he wished; I did not care, only nobody must ever come into my
                              room. He looked ashamed, and pleased, too; but he brought them, and
                              nobody ever did come into my room. By-and-by Elizabeth Colton brought
                              a little baby down stairs, and its name was Clara. Poor child! poor
                              little Mormon child! I hope it will die some time before it grows up;
                              only I should not like it to come my side of heaven, for it had blue
                              eyes like John's.</p>
                           <p>"Then I grew more and more ill, and now I am really dying, and no
                              letter has come from you! It takes so long—three whole months—and I
                              have been more than a year in the house with John Henderson and the
                              two women. I know I shall never see you, but I must speak. I must,
                              even out of the grave; and I keep hearing the old fugue, 'The Lord is
                              just, is just, is just; the Lord is just and good!' Is He? I know He
                              is; but I forget sometimes. Uncle Field! you must pray for John! you
                                 <emph>must!</emph> I cannot die and leave him in his sins, his
                              delusion; he does not think it is sin, but I know it. Pray! pray! dear
                              Uncle! don't be discouraged;—do not fear—he <emph>will</emph> be
                              undeceived some time; he will repent, I know! The Lord is just, and I
                              will pray in heaven, and I will tell Nelly to, but <emph>you</emph>
                              must. It says in the Bible, 'the prayer of a righteous man;' and oh! I
                              am not righteous! I should not have married him; it was an unequal
                              yoke, and I have borne the burden; but I loved him so much! Uncle
                              Field, I did not keep myself from idols. Pray. I shall be dead, but he
                              lives. Pray for him, and, if you will, for the little child—because—I
                              am dying. Dear Nelly!"—</p>

                  deciphered the last broken, trembling line, of Ada's story. "Here I have been five
                  minutes, and you did not hear me!" I really had blotted the letter!</p>

               <head>VIII. THE RICH MERCHANT OF CAIRO.</head>
               <p>A GREAT while ago—several hundred years at least—there lived in Cairo a rich
                  merchant, whose name was Abdallah. He had other names besides, as is the custom
                  there, but none that added to his reputation or credit. He was commonly called
                  Abdallah the Rich, and sometimes Abdallah the Miserly.</p>
               <p>From boyhood, almost, he had been engaged in traffic, and always successfully.
                  Shift as it might, the wind was still favorable to some of his ships, and ventures
                  which ruined other merchants overflowed his coffers with gold. The blue
                  Mediterranean reflected the gleam of his sails. Nile, the father of rivers, was
                  shadowed by the swarthy faces of the slaves who rowed his boats, and the burning
                  sands of the desert were trampled by the feet of his caravans. His emissaries were
                  known in the bazaars of Delhi and Damascus, in the spicy forests of Ceylon, and
                  among the pearl-divers of the far Indian seas. They even traded, it is said, with
                  the natives of Timbuctoo, the mysterious city whose existence has so often been
                  denied. Abdallah, however, had never quitted Cairo, the city of his birth. He knew
                  too well the dangers and hardships of travel to think of exposing his precious
                  person to them. He had but to name a place to his agents, and say, "Go there," and
                  they went.</p>
               <p>His bazaars were in different parts of the city, but his house, like that of every
                  good Turk, was in the Turkish Quarter. It was three stories in height, and the
                  upper stories projected over the lower ones, casting a shadow even at noonday on
                  the street below. The walls were originally white, with horizontal bars of
                  crimson, like the stripes in a flag; but years had elapsed since they were
                  painted, and they were kept in such bad repair that it was hard to say what color
                  they really were—a smoky yellow, or a muddy red.</p>
               <p>Along the front of the mansion, on a level with the floor of the two upper
                  stories, ran a couple of balconies closely shut in with lattice-work. You see such
                  lattices in most Oriental pictures; they are made of thin slips of wood like our
                  lath, and cross each other diamond-wise. Save the arch over the door, which was
                  elaborately carved, and illuminated with gold letters—a text from the Koran,—there
                  was nothing about the outside of the house to stamp its owner a wealthy man.
                  Inside, however, it was apparent, and all was rich and beautiful.</p>
               <p>Like many other mean and selfish men, Abdallah was at heart sensual and luxurious.
                  His floors were carpeted with the richest stuffs of the East, brilliant in dye,
                  and soft as flowers to the feet. Where the marble pavement was seen, as it was in
                  some rooms which were merely strewn with mats, it was cunningly inlaid with
                  mosaics. Couches and divans softer than down lined the walls, and cabinets were
                  filled with chiboques, and beautiful Persian pipes, whose water-bowls were buried
                  in the long coil of their stems.</p>
               <p>You passed from room to room by gliding between pillars, and by pushing aside
                  curtains. Over the curtains rose magnificent arches of the finest and costliest
                  workmanship. It would have made you feel proud just to walk beneath them, they
                  were so grand, and yet so airy. Spicy<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7187-00000095"/>
                  cressets hung from the ceiling, and lanterns of divers colors dangled on golden
                  chains. Pictures and statues there were none, both being forbidden by the Koran,
                  but vases and cups abounded; vases of exquisite pattern, gold and silver, heaped
                  with precious stones, pearls, rubies, and emeralds; and cups which a king might
                  have drained. And Abdallah did drain them daily, so fond was he of his vault of
                  old Greek wine.</p>
               <p>But it was not within doors, after all, that the wealth of Abdallah was most
                  manifest, but in his garden, which was the finest in all Cairo. It was situated at
                  the back of the house, and was walled in with a high wall. A forest could not have
                  been more shady and pleasant, so thick and leafy were the trees, palms, acacias,
                  and sycamores, and so cool the winds imprisoned in their green retreats. The walks
                  were hedged with roses and jessamines, and roofed with the branches of
                  fruit-trees. Here hung the golden quince, there the bloom-cheeked peach, and there
                  purple plums and red pomegranates.</p>
               <p>In the centre of the garden was a kiosk, or Turkish summer-house, a miracle of
                  grace and beauty. It was square, with four pillars on each side, and a fretted
                  dome overhead. The pillars supported Saracenic arches, through which came gleams
                  of the garden around, and the mingled scent of its flowers. From a black marble
                  urn in the basin of the kiosk gushed a sparkling fountain, a broad silver shaft
                  with a willowy base that dripped back into the urn, and over its rim into the
                  bubbling ripples below.</p>
               <p>It was a nook of delight, and a perfect nest of birds, the wondrous birds of the
                  East. Some were inclosed in cages of sandal-wood and pearl, while others were as
                  free as the air in which they wantoned. Peacocks strutted in and out, spreading
                  their gorgeous trains; golden pheasants dreamed in the gloom of the dome; parrots
                  chattered and swung on their rings, and birds-of-paradise, with sweeping rainbow
                  tails, flew from perch to perch. Truly it was an enchanted place, that garden and
                  house, and worthy of a better master than Abdallah.</p>
               <p>Here Abdallah dwelt year after year. No one shared his enjoyments save his
                  daughter, Zuleika, and she only when he was away. There was not much happiness in
                  the house where Abdallah was, he was so selfish and exacting. It was impossible to
                  please him. He thought of no one but himself, and his own gains and losses. He had
                  a wonderful head for accounts, and could reckon untold sums as by instinct. He
                  knew to a fraction how much every debtor owed him, and how much it cost him to
                  just keep the life in his slaves.</p>
               <p>When the business of the day was over, and he had smoked his bubbling pipe, and
                  quaffed his cup of Greek wine, he used to shut himself up in his room and gloat
                  over his gold. It was his god, and he recognised no other, except he wished to
                  take a false oath. Then he was profuse of his "by Allahs," and "the holy beard of
                  the Prophet!"</p>
               <p>Such was the man Abdallah, and such his mode of life up to the morning when our
                  story begins. Having a new scheme of gain on hand that morning, he rose earlier
                  than usual, performed his customary ablutions, and prepared to depart for the
                  market-place. Before setting forth, he allotted their day's work to his servants
                  and slaves; then he charged his daughter Zuleika not to leave the house during his
                  absence; and, finally, after he had made everybody as miserable as he could, he
                  departed, and the door was barred behind him.</p>
               <p>It was still early in Cairo, and but few of the better citizens had yet risen. The
                  streets were filled with the poorest classes, and they jostled Abdallah in
                  passing, He<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7187-00000096"/> avoided them as much as
                  possible, by picking the least-crowded thoroughfares, and keeping close to the
                  houses. Here sauntered a water-carrier, with his jar poised on his head; and there
                  marched a string of camels, bound for Siout and the desert. Artisans hurried to
                  their work-snops, rubbing their eyes as they went; donkeys turned the corners
                  suddenly, and almost knocked him down; and, to crown all, a pertinacious driver
                  insisted on having his custom! He must have been a wag, or a stranger in Cairo,
                  that driver, to have for a moment imagined that Abdallah the Miser would ride. He
                  knew the value of money too well, however wearied he might be, to think of
                  spending it in that way. The idea was absurd.</p>
               <p>As I said before, the streets were filled with the poorest classes, and the short
                  turn that Abdallah made to reach the market-place led him among their dwellings.
                  He had but little time for observation, so intent was he in hatching his schemes,
                  but he could not help seeing the filth and misery which surrounded him. The houses
                  were in a ruinous and tumble-down condition; many of them without windows and
                  doors—mere hovels—and their dwellers were in perfect keeping, lean, sallow, and
                  ragged.</p>
               <p>Few of the men were at home, for the day being a festival, promised an abundant
                  alms; but he saw the women in the miserable rooms, and troops of squalid children.
                  Some of the women were busy with household matters, kindling fires for the morning
                  meal, and mending the rents in their garments: others sat in the ashes, supine and
                  dejected, their long hair falling over their eyes, and over the infants on their
                  bosoms. These were the mothers and grandmothers: if there were girls in the family
                  they were generally at the windows, ogling the passers-by, and singing ribald
                  songs to entice them in.</p>
               <p>One among the number arrested the sight of Abdallah, she was so much like his own
                  child Zuleika. She was just her height, although her figure was frailer; had the
                  same black hair adorned with sequins, and the same lustrous large eyes and long
                  lashes. Zuleika, however, lacked the mingled mirth and melancholy of her
                  counterfeit; nor was she ever seen, like her, at the balcony unveiled. The
                  likeness puzzled Abdallah, but he knew that Zuleika was safe at home, and his
                  schemes came into his head again—so he passed on, and forgot it.</p>
               <p>He had now reached a better portion of the city, although he was still in the
                  Beggars' Quarter. He stopped in the public square, and gazed about him. His vision
                  was bounded on all sides by the white wall of the city, and the fringe of palms
                  overlooking it. An open country lay on the north—a region of gardens and
                  grain-fields; on the south and west, the shining length of the Nile flecked with
                  sails, and the pyramids that loomed through the haze of the Lybian desert. But the
                  glory of the dawn was in the east, in the serene blue sky, and on the crests of
                  the Mokattam hills, which were tipped with light. The sun had not yet risen, but
                  the domes of the mosques were brightening, and the minarets burned with rosy
                  flames.</p>
               <p>The heart of Abdallah was glad within him, he hardly knew why, and he went on his
                  way with a lighter and firmer step. To say that he was depressed by the Beggars'
                  Quarter, or that he pitied its unfortunate dwellers, would show but little
                  knowledge of a nature like his. Still, he felt happy in leaving them behind him,
                  and in comparing his condition with theirs.</p>
               <p>He drew near the market-place, in which his bazaars were held, when he was
                  accosted by a beggar.</p>
               <p>"I am poor," said the beggar; "it is two days now since I have tasted food."</p>
               <pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7187-00000097"/>
               <p>"What is that to me?" inquired the merchant.</p>
               <p>"Abdallah the Rich, I am poor and hungry, and I demand alms from thee!"</p>
               <p>Abdallah started back amazed. He was not accustomed to demands; besides he had
                  never before been mimicked as he was by the beggar; for the voice of the latter
                  was an exact echo of his own. Nor did the imitation stop at his voice: form,
                  features, gait, everything pertaining to Abdallah was reproduced with strange
                  fidelity. It was as if he saw himself in a mirror, or stood beside himself in a
                  dream!</p>
               <p>There was a difference, though, between the beggar's garments and those of
                  Abdallah. The merchant was dressed as became his station and wealth, in a flowing
                  robe, with a rich sash around his waist, and a jewel-hilted dagger in his belt.
                  His turban was a costly cashmere shawl, and his slippers were heavily embroidered
                  with gold. The beggar was clad in rags which failed to hide his leanness, and he
                  supported his tottering limbs with a long staff. His face was thin and ghastly,
                  and his eyes, that burned with an unnatural lustre, were deeply sunken in their
                  sockets. He was like Abdallah, and yet unlike; looking not so much as Abdallah
                  did, as Abdallah might, should he by any chance become a beggar.</p>
               <p>"Abdallah the Miserly," said the beggar, "you are rolling in abundance, while I am
                  starving with want. Help me, or I die."</p>
               <p>"You are mistaken in thinking me rich," said the covetous merchant. "True, I have
                  the reputation of wealth, but everybody knows the uncertainty of a merchant's
                  business. To-day he is rich, to-morrow poor. But, admitting that I am rich, my
                  money is my own. I owe it entirely to my own exertions, and not to others. I
                  cannot help you, so let me pass."</p>
               <p>"But I am dying," persisted the beggar.</p>
               <p>"Again I say, what is that to me?"</p>
               <p>"Listen to me, Abdallah," said the excited beggar, shaking his skinny finger in
                  the face of the merchant. "Listen to me, hard-hearted man, and tremble. You refuse
                  me, your fellow-man, bread, and you arrogate to yourself your good fortune. These
                  are deadly sins, and must be atoned for. God gave you prosperity; he can give you
                  adversity as well. And he does; from this hour there is a spell upon you."</p>
               <p>The merchant turned in wrath, and was about to smite the beggar, when he saw the
                  Captain of the Sultan's Guard approaching in the distance. In spite of himself, he
                  shuddered and turned pale. He did not for an instant believe the beggar's
                  prophecy; but he knew that no man's life was safe, if it were known that he was
                  rich, and the Sultan was in want of money.</p>
               <p>"The curse is beginning to work, Abdallah," said the beggar, tauntingly; but
                  Abdallah was to much troubled to hear him. He ran over in his mind all his late
                  business transactions, to see how far the worst had infringed the law; wondered
                  which one of his many agents was most likely to betray him; and whether, if the
                  worst came to the worst, he could manage to escape with life.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps I may escape even now," said he to himself: but no—the guard was too
                  close. Besides, he reasoned, if I attempt flight, it will seem to confirm
                  suspicion. But he could not have flown had he tried, for his feet were rooted to
                  the ground.</p>
               <p>He was a grim-looking fellow, the Captain of the Guard, and his manner of
                  arresting Abdallah was not calculated to set the latter at ease. He drew his long
                  sword with one hand, and clutched the merchant by the wrist with the other, while
                  the soldiers sprang upon him<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7187-00000098"/> from the
                  opposite side, and pinioned his arms behind him. He was then marched off in the
                  direction of the Sultan's palace. As might have been expected, his arrest drew
                  together a crowd. First and foremost came the rabble from the Beggars' Quarter;
                  children who broke off their plays to revile him; women who ran to see if it was
                  their lovers or husbands; and numbers of the beggar-men, whom the news had already
                  reached.</p>
               <p>Among others, was the girl who looked so much like Zuleika. It was strange, but
                  she was not in the least like Zuleika now. She had lustrous eyes, long lashes, and
                  black hair, adorned with sequins; but her face was haggard with sensuality, and
                  distorted with indecent mirth. She was no more like Zuleika—the pure and beautiful
                  Zuleika—than a wandering comet, a hell of aerial fire is like the moon, the silver
                  Eden of night.</p>
               <p>"This is marvellous, this change," thought Abdallah; and the beggar coming into
                  his mind, he turned his head to see if the beggar was changed also; and lo! he had
                  vanished.</p>
               <p>The guard and their prisoner had now reached the Sultan's palace. It was a holiday
                  in Cairo, and the square was filled with soldiers. Bodies of black troops were
                  drawn up in files on each side, while the centre was filled by the dignitaries of
                  the empire; bashaws of distant provinces, white-bearded old sheiks of desert
                  tribes, and daring Mamelukes. Beside the palace-gate, stood two gigantic Nubian
                  slaves, the executioners of the Sultan, one swinging his bowstring, the other
                  poising his immense scymitar.</p>
               <p>The gates were thrown open, and the Sultan came forth to judgment. The Commander
                  of the Faithful was mounted on a superb Arab barb, whose neck arched proudly, and
                  whose step disdained the earth. His turban was covered with jewels, and it shone
                  like a constellation under his cloudy plume. His caftan was green, the sacred
                  color, but his sash was deep red. It was an ominous color with the Commander of
                  the Faithful, for it generally betokened the shedding of blood. So his court
                  approached him with terror, kissing his robe, and even the ground before him.
                  "Long life to the Shereef! May God prolong his days!"</p>
               <p>Casting his eyes over the prostrate crowd, the Commander of the Faithful saw
                  Abdallah kneeling in the custody of the Captain of the Guard. He summoned the
                  latter, and as he drew near, dragging the helpless culprit, beckoned to the
                  executioners. Behold Abdallah between them, in front of the Sultan.</p>
               <p>"Long life to the Shereef! May God prolong his days!"</p>
               <p>"We have heard of this man," said the Commander of the Faithful; "does any here
                  know him? It is said that he is rich, very rich. It is also said that his riches
                  are ill-gotten. If he has wronged any here, even a slave, let the wronged man step
                  forth, and accuse him. By the beard of my father, he shall have justice!"</p>
               <p>The words of the Sultan passed from mouth to mouth till they reached the ears of a
                  merchant who was passing the palace. Emboldened by the Sultan's permission, he
                  accused Abdallah.</p>
               <p>"Commander of the Faithful, the merchant Abdallah owes me five purses of gold,
                  which he refuses to pay. He came to me one day, accompanied by a strange merchant,
                  who, he said, was his friend; and who wished to purchase sandal-wood and gums. I
                  sold him five purses' worth, Abdallah agreeing to pay for the same, in case his
                  friend did not. Twelve moons have passed since there, and I have not seen the
                  merchant, nor will Abdallah pay me the debt."</p>
               <pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7187-00000099"/>
               <p>"Your case is hard," said the Sultan; "but we cannot help you. The law will do you
                  justice, if you can prove your claim. We give you a purse of gold that you may
                  prosecute it freely."</p>
               <p>The next accuser was one of the Mamelukes.</p>
               <p>"Commander of the Faithful, this shop-keeper lately sold me a sword for a true
                  Damascus blade. I paid him his price without higgling, and went forth to battle
                  with the enemies of the Prophet. We were hard pushed by the accursed Giaours, and
                  fell before them like ripe grain. A boy, whom I could have slain with the wind of
                  a good scymitar, engaged me; and, snapping my sword like a reed, gave me this ugly
                  gash on the cheek. I have no sword now. Here is the hilt of my famous Damascus
                  blade," and he threw it at the feet of the Sultan's barb; "give me another,
                  Master, and I will punish the lying shop-keeper."</p>
               <p>"You are a brave fellow, Mameluke," said the Sultan, unbuckling his own sword, and
                  handing it to the soldier; "wear this, and smite the Giaours. Leave the shopkeeper
                  to us."</p>
               <p>The soldier fell back in the ranks, and the Sultan made a sign to the slave with
                  the bowstring, who seized Abdallah, and prepared to strangle him.</p>
               <p>The next accuser was one of the desert sheiks.</p>
               <p>"Seven years ago," he said, "there was a famine among my people. The tidings
                  reached Cairo, and this dog sent his agents amongst us loaded with corn, not to
                  relieve our wants, but to rob us of our flocks and herds. He built granaries in
                  our midst, and tortured us with the sight of food which few were rich enough to
                  buy. We implored the assistance of other merchants, and many attempted to help us,
                  but he drove them all from the field, some by bribery, and some by underselling,
                  till, at last, no one would venture against him. The souls of our dead cry out for
                  justice—justice on the corn-selling dog!"</p>
               <p>"We, too, have a cause of complaint," said the Commander of the Faithful, after a
                  score or two had finished accusing Abdallah. "This jewel," and he plucked one from
                  his turban, "was sold us by the merchant for a pure diamond, and it turns out to
                  be a bit of glass. We gave him a thousand purses for what is not worth a piastre.
                  To punish him for the cheat we confiscate his estates for the Prophet's treasury,
                  and we seize his daughter for the imperial harem. As for the wretch himself he
                  shall become a slave. We give him to your tribe," said the Sultan, turning to the
                  desert sheik: "It is just that he should suffer, even as he has made others. The
                  dog is no longer Abdallah the Merchant, but Abdallah the Slave. God is great!"</p>
               <p>"Long life to the Shereef! May God prolong his days!"</p>
               <p>The Sultan shook the reins of his barb, and rode down the square, accompanied by
                  his bashaws and sheiks. The Mamelukes and black troops remained, together with
                  Abdallah and the executioners. There was no danger now in insulting him, and they
                  made the most of the opportunity. The Mamelukes began by robbing him of everything
                  valuable. One snatched his turban, another his sash, a third his jewel-hilted
                  dagger, and the fourth the purse which he vainly attempted to conceal; the rest,
                  meanwhile, rode around him and pricked him with the points of their long spears.
                  He was then handed over to the soldiers, and buffeted about till his bones ached.
                  When the sheik returned for his slave he found him in a sorry plight, for he was
                  covered with blood and bruises, and his garments were torn to tatters. Could his
                  counterfeit and second self, the vanished beggar, have seen<pb n="198-199"
                     xml:id="VAC7187-00000100"/> him then, even he must have pitied him, he was so
                  ragged and forlorn.</p>
               <p>It pleased the sheik to ride through Cairo before he started for the desert, and
                  the whim seized him to make Abdallah lead his camel. The slave walked before his
                  master, sullen and slow, the string of the camel slack in his hand, and his eyes
                  fixed on the ground. Turn which way he would he was blasted by the sight of human
                  faces. Men of all ranks and conditions rejoiced at his abasement. Children climbed
                  up arches and gateways to get a glimpse of him; citizens pointed him out to
                  strangers, and veiled women peered at him from latticed balconies. Many of his
                  debtors were present, and merry enough they were, too. It was not every day that
                  they could pay their debts so easily!</p>
               <p>After traversing the principal streets of the city, passing squares, markets, and
                  bazaars, the sheik halted to make room for a procession. First came a file of
                  soldiers loaded with swords and daggers, and, armfuls of sashes and shawls; then a
                  row of black slaves, each with a jar of gold or jewels on his head; and lastly,
                  the head eunuch, leading a veiled girl, who trembled under her veil! The heart of
                  the slave sunk within him. It was the spoil of his own bazaars which the Sultan
                  had just seized, and his own child Zuleika on her way to the accursed harem! A
                  mist swam before the eyes of the wretched man; he staggered a step, and fell
                  senseless in the dust.</p>
               <p>When he came to himself he was travelling with a caravan, for the tribe whose
                  slave he had become were journeying back to the desert. The sheik rode at their
                  head, and Abdallah led his camel over the sand.</p>
               <p>An ocean of yellow sand stretched away on all sides till it reached the edge of
                  the horizon. Not a tree or plant was to be seen anywhere, not even a blade of
                  grass. The sky was without a cloud, intensely blue and bright, and the sun a
                  perfect glare of light.</p>
               <p>Sometimes they followed the track of former caravans, trampling in the footprints
                  of men and camels; at others, they struck out a path for themselves, making the
                  faraway mountains landmarks.</p>
               <p>The road was frequently strewn with bones, the skeletons of men and camels, some
                  of whom were overthrown by whirling clouds of sand, while others must have
                  perished from starvation.</p>
               <p>One skeleton in particular impressed Abdallah, and made him thoughtful for a long
                  time. It lay in advance of the multitude, and beside it was a broken water-cruse.
                  He picked up a fragment of the cruse, and saw its owner's name engraved under the
                  mark of the potter. The dead man was one of his own agents, a trusty Egyptian, who
                  started on a long journey for him, and never returned. "He met his fate in the
                  desert," thought Abdallah; "he was starved to death that I might increase my
                  gains. I remember now that his wife told me this, but I feigned to think it false,
                  and refused her a single piastre. I am punished now, for I am in the desert
                  myself. Allah forbid that his fate should be mine!"</p>
               <p>He cast his eyes over the sea of rolling sand, and sighed aloud. Up to this time,
                  and it was now the second day of the journey, he had made no complaint; but now
                  his limbs began to fail him from excessive weariness. The hot sand burnt his
                  tender feet; the waste of flint, into which the caravan had come, cut him to the
                  very bone, and his steps were marked with blood.</p>
               <p>In the afternoon the caravan halted at a valley well, and pitched their tents for
                  the night. The valley was a mere gully, the bed of some ancient river, and the
                  well a pit of brackish water. A stunted palm rustled in the burning<pb n="200-201"
                     xml:id="VAC7187-00000101"/> air, and a few brave tufts of grass disputed the
                  supremacy of the sand. It was a dreary place, but it seemed a garden to the weary
                  Abdallah.</p>
               <p>The camels were fed and tethered for the night; the sheik and his sons sat
                  cross-legged in the tent and related marvellous tales: the slaves huddled
                  together, and sang wild songs in strange tongues: but Abdallah stood alone in the
                  shade of the palm. His first impulse was flight, but a glance at his swollen feet
                  convinced him of its utter folly. Had he needed anything else to deter him, he
                  could have found it in the hyena tracks which surrounded the valley.</p>
               <p>He threw himself under the stunted palm, and strove to forget the change in his
                  fortune. He was no longer Abdallah the slave, nor yet Abdallah the merchant, but
                  Abdallah the man—a man alone with nature.</p>
               <p>The stars were out by thousands, sparkling in the deep blue sky, and the moon
                  lifted her horn above the rim of the desert. The first news that Abdallah had of
                  her presence was a long ray of light which she shot full in his eyes. He turned
                  his head aside, and it glinted on the surface of the well. A second followed it,
                  and discovered what the dusk had for some time concealed, the dusky faces of the
                  slaves as they sang their strange wild songs. Then Abdallah saw the white tent of
                  the sheik, and the group of tethered camels, and then the stretch of desert
                  beyond.</p>
               <p>There was something in the moonlight which made everything it shone upon
                  beautiful, even the stern old sheik who came to the door of his tent to watch the
                  slaves. It softened the heart of Abdallah and filled him with tender and dreamy
                  thoughts. He remembered how often he had seen it shining on the mosques and domes
                  of Cairo, and how it flooded the walks of his garden, and dripped from the walls
                  of his beloved kiosk. Then his fancy wandered, as a moonlight fancy sometimes
                  will, to ruinous old houses, and he saw the Beggars' Quarter as it was on the
                  previous morning. The houses were old still, with walls and chimneys leaning to a
                  fall; yet their decay seemed in some degree repaired, for the chinks and doors
                  were closed, he knew not how, while the windows were curtained with white.</p>
               <p>"If the moonlight does so much for the beggars' houses," thought Abdallah, "what
                  might not human kindness do for the beggars?" It was a manly thought, and it
                  ennobled even while it grieved him. He pondered over his past life, its narrow
                  selfishness and blindness, and giving himself up to the influences around, was
                  initiated into the mysteries of Nature. And the first thing that the universal
                  mother taught him was that nothing exists for itself alone. He saw, in thought,
                  the moon and stars shining on the earth, and the earth baring her brow to receive
                  their light, giving her own in return. The land gradually crumbled into the sea on
                  one side of the world, while the sea as gradually withdrew its waters from the
                  land on the other. The clouds covered the mountains with snow; the snow melted and
                  formed rivers; the rivers with mist fed the clouds; and the clouds turned into
                  snow, and again covered the mountains. The dew crept into the heart of the
                  flowers, and the flowers breathed their fragrance to the falling dew. Innumerable
                  were the examples of Nature, that it is necessary to give, as well as to receive.
                  Yes, and even to give when there is no hope of receiving in return. "The desert,
                  for instance," thought Abdallah, "what can the sun hope to gain by shining on its
                  rocks and billows of sand? For leagues there is no living thing, save now and then
                  a scorpion, or a straggling blade of grass. Yet the sun shines as generously there
                  as in the gardens of Cashmere, and the stars and the queenly moon brighten the
                  solitude with their luminous smiles! And the great God of the<pb n="202-203"
                     xml:id="VAC7187-00000102"/> heavens, the infinite and everlasting Allah, who
                  made and overlooks the worlds—of what avail to Him are the prayers and the lives
                  of even the holiest? Yet the hands of the great Father are always stretched forth
                  with blessings and bounties, and his ears are always open to the cries of his
                  children."</p>
               <p>"I have not performed my part," said Abdallah sadly, "as God and Nature perform
                  theirs, but from this hour I will amend my life. I have not fallen in vain since I
                  have learned to fulfil my duty. God is great!"</p>
               <p>He rose from his seat beneath the palm, and walked to the edge of the valley,
                  where he saw a stunted colocynth growing alone in the sand. Curiosity impelled him
                  to view it closer, and he hastened to it, although it grew in the midst of the
                  hyena tracks. Stooping on his hands and knees he brushed the sand from it, and
                  found that it was dying for want of moisture. Its leaves were shrivelled with
                  heat, and the poor melon which it strove to shelter was fairly wilted on the stem.
                  It was a worthless plant at best, so bitter that no animal could eat it; but its
                  forlorn condition touched the heart of Abdallah, and retracing his steps to the
                  well he proceeded to water it, using for that purpose a fragment of the broken
                  cruse which he picked up in the desert. That done, he bowed his head to the Holy
                  City, and said the prayers of the Faithful, and, creeping among the camels, he was
                  soon fast asleep.</p>
               <p>The caravan rose at dawn, and resumed their march. The first good deed of Abdallah
                  repaid him well, for the colocynth was green and fresh. It waved its leaves to him
                  at parting, and the shine of its yellow melon was brighter than gold.</p>
               <p>The sky above, and the sand below; a desert of blue, and a desert of yellow. In
                  the upper desert marched the sun, showering abroad his spears of fire, in the
                  under desert the sheik and his tribe, vainly endeavoring to ward them off.</p>
               <p>Sun, and sand, and hot wind. Fragments of bleaching bones. A winding string of men
                  and camels, and a solitary swooping kite!</p>
               <p>About noon they were startled by a mirage. It was the first that Abdallah had ever
                  seen, and he marvelled greatly thereat. It grew up from the sand suddenly, and
                  assumed the shape of a band of roving Bedouins, a tribe of desert robbers, mounted
                  on flying stallions, and armed with long spears which they brandished
                  furiously.</p>
               <p>Then it became the house of Abdallah, a perfect picture of his lost mansion in
                  Cairo. Like that, its walls were striped with red; its balconies shaded the
                  street; the fountain played in its kiosk; and a mock Zuleika walked in the shade
                  of its unreal trees!</p>
               <p>Its third change was into the Beggars' Quarter, which seemed more wretched, if
                  that were possible, than when Abdallah saw it last. Some of the houses had fairly
                  tumbled down, nearly all the windows and doors were gone, and the squalid wretches
                  had multiplied in every room. Parents had strangled their children, and were
                  weeping for them; children had grown up, and were beating their parents; and the
                  girl with sequins in her hair—she lay stone dead in the street!</p>
               <p>Then the mirage surrounded Abdallah, and became the very square in which he was
                  stopped by the beggar. He stared down the long streets, and saw the white wall of
                  the city, and the fringe of palms overlooking it. Gardens and grain-fields barred
                  the north; on the south and west ran the Nile, alive with glancing sails. The
                  Mokattam hills were flooded with light, and the mosques and minarets blazed with
                  rosy flames. It was too like Cairo, not to be Cairo itself! Abdallah rubbed his
                  eyes, like a man awaking<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7187-00000103"/> ing from a
                  dream, and found to his great joy that he had not stirred from the square. The
                  beggar still stood before him, holding out his hand for alms, and in the distance
                  he saw the Captain of the Sultan's Guard! Hardly a moment had elapsed, and yet
                  Abdallah had passed through so many changes of fortune. It was like the prophet's
                  living in the seventh heaven seventy thousand years, while a drop of water was
                  falling from his pitcher to the ground.</p>
               <p>"I have not dreamed in vain," said the thankful and humbled merchant, "for I have
                  learned to perform my duty. Here, my brother, is alms for thee," and he gave the
                  beggar a piece of gold; "depart in peace, and be happy. For me—I will go and pray.
                  God is Great!"</p>
               <p>"God is Great!"—the muezzins took up the cry, and passed it from minaret to
                  minaret, till the morning wind was vocal with the sound. The faithful heard it in
                  their houses, and came pouring into the streets, and sought the nearest mosque.
                  Every man drew the slippers from his feet, and, crossing the sacred threshold,
                  worshipped God and the Prophet. There were many solemn prayers said that day, and
                  many grateful men in Cairo, but none that were more devout than Abdallah the
                  Merchant.</p>
               <p>"For, by the grace of God," he said, "I am still Abdallah the Merchant, and not
                  Abdallah the Slave."</p>

               <head>IX. THE LEGEND OF GOODMAN POVERTY.</head>
               <p>ONE day I was so fortunate as to discover an old traditionary relic of great
                  beauty; the legend and its title running as follows:</p>
               <p>"<title>The new and pleasant history of Goodman Poverty; showing who Poverty was,
                     where he had his origin, in what fashion he dealt with Death, and when he will
                     come to an end in the world.</title>"</p>
               <p>Saint Peter and Saint Paul, overtaken suddenly by a great storm, once upon a time,
                  when they were journeying together, came to the outskirts of a village, where, at
                  first sight, they perceived only a rich man's house, so grand that they hesitated
                  to enter it.</p>
               <p>"It seems to me, in my poor judgment," said Saint Peter, "that it would be well,
                  before knocking at the gate of this grand house, to try and learn in the
                  neighborhood what manner of person the master may be; and whether he be really a
                  man of substance, and well to do in the world; for this is a point upon which one
                  is often mistaken. No matter how handsome the houses we see by the wayside, we
                  generally find that those who call themselves their owners are over head and ears
                  in debt; owing their fine dwellings, and all that they contain, to their
                  creditors, and not possessing, in reality, a farthing of their own to bless
                  themselves with."</p>
               <p>Saint Paul fully agreed in this prudent view of the case<pb n="206-207"
                     xml:id="VAC7187-00000104"/> but he was hungry, and cast his eyes about in every
                  direction, seeking some one of whom to make the necessary inquiries. At length he
                  exclaimed, joyfully, "I see a woman washing linen in yonder pool; I will go and
                  ask her if she knows anything of the master of the house."</p>
               <p>So saying, he approached the washerwoman, and accosting her very politely,
                  "Good-day to you, dame," said he; "this is a heavy rain that we are having
                  to-day!"</p>
               <p>"Sooth, and ye may well say so, master," replied the woman, without stopping her
                  work, "and 'tis lucky for me 'tis only water, for if it were wine it would hardly
                  suit my washing; but then, to be sure, we might have a brave drinking bout, and
                  after that lay up a good store in the cellar."</p>
               <p>"Ye are merry, methinks, good dame!" returned Saint Paul.</p>
               <p>"And wherefore not?" quoth the washerwoman. "Thank God, I lack nothing that a
                  woman need wish for, except, to be sure, now and then a little money."</p>
               <p>"Money!" cried the Saint; "ah, you are very fortunate in having no money, and
                  being able to do without it."</p>
               <p>"Aye, aye, that's all very well to say," returned the Washerwoman; "but, for all
                  the harm that money has ever done to me, I may say that I shouldn't mind seeing a
                  little more of it!"</p>
               <p>"I see you like to have your joke, my good dame," continued the Saint; "but I
                  assure you that money causes the ruin of a vast number of souls; and that it were
                  to be wished, for the good of very many people, that they might never behold a
                  coin all the days of their life."</p>
               <p>"As for me," said the washerwoman, "I am too busy to do much wishing; and a crown
                  so seldom comes in my way that I never had the chance to look at one long enough
                  to make out the pictures upon it."</p>
               <p>Saint Peter, who had been standing all this time under an oak, where he had taken
                  refuge from the rain, grew impatient at hearing this long conversation, and begged
                  Saint Paul to come away at once, and seek some better shelter. So they went up to
                  the gate of the mansion, and lifted the knocker; but the master of the house put
                  his head out of the window and bade them begone.</p>
               <p>"This is no inn, fellows," cried he, roughly; "off with you this moment, and look
                  for lodgings elsewhere!" And with this he shut the window, and turned scornfully
                  away.</p>
               <p>But the poor travellers were now drenched to the skin, and their forlorn plight
                  touched the washerwoman's heart with pity.</p>
               <p>"I wish I could take ye home with me," said she; "I would do so with right
                  good-will; for ye seem to be decent, honest folk; but I dare not ask ye in, for I
                  am a widow, and the neighbors would talk. But if ye will have patience a bit,
                  while I finish my washing, I will presently take ye to the house of one of the
                  townspeople, Poverty by name, who lives at the further end of the village, and who
                  will gladly give ye a night's lodging."</p>
               <p>Accordingly, as soon as the washing was done, the woman led Saint Peter and Saint
                  Paul to Poverty's cottage, as she had promised to do.</p>
               <p>It was but a little past sundown, and yet the Goodman was already gone to bed.</p>
               <p>"Halloo, Poverty!" cried the washerwoman, going close up to the window; "here are
                  two poor travellers who have been caught in the storm, and who know not where to
                  lay their heads!"</p>
               <p>Goodman Poverty had no sooner heard that these poor people wanted a night's
                  lodging than he lifted the latch, and bade them come in. "Light the lamp,
                  neighbor," said he to the washerwoman, as she stepped across the threshold.</p>
               <pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7187-00000105"/>
               <p>Saint Peter and Saint Paul now entered the cottage. Everything in the house was
                  topsy-turvy; one could distinguish nothing for the confusion; and the master
                  himself tall, thin, withered, and pale, looked as though he had just come out of a
                  sepulchre.</p>
               <p>"God be praised for the shelter of this roof, and may his blessing descend upon
                  it!" said St. Peter.</p>
               <p>"Amen!" responded Poverty; "so mote it be! In sooth, my masters, I should have
                  great need of his blessing, to be able to offer you any supper; for I have not so
                  much as a morsel of bread in the house."</p>
               <p>But the washerwoman, who had expected as much, now opened a basket which she had
                  brought with her, and produced four fine large whitings, ready fried, a great
                  brown loaf, and a pitcher of wine.</p>
               <p>"Ah, Lord! bread and fish, as I live!" cried Saint Paul, greatly delighted.</p>
               <p>"Thank ye kindly, dame," said Saint Peter; "we only asked for a roof to cover us,
                  and you give us also this good supper. The Lord reward you for all the trouble you
                  have taken!"</p>
               <p>"Bah!" cried the washerwoman, setting out the food on the rickety table; "a morsel
                  before sleeping never yet did harm to anybody; and, for my part, I am well paid in
                  being able to offer your friend something to his mind."</p>
               <p>They now seated themselves at the table, and began to eat with good appetites; all
                  but Poverty, who was sad because of something that had happened to him that very
                  afternoon. The poor man possessed nothing in the world but his cottage, and the
                  little paddock, about as long as your arm, that lay behind it, and in which grew a
                  fine pear-tree; but the hedge round this paddock was not much harder to get
                  through than a spider's web, and certain marauders from the neighborhood had taken
                  advantage of this bad state of the hedge to get through into the paddock, and rob
                  the pear-tree, whose fruit formed the Goodman's sole revenue. This was why he had
                  gone to bed supperless, vexed to the heart at seeing the half of his crop stolen
                  from him; and his trouble was still so great that he could not touch a mouthful of
                  the four large whitings, ready fried, the great loaf, and the pitcher of wine,
                  with which his guests were regaling themselves. When the supper was over, Saint
                  Peter, looking at Saint Paul, said to him, in a low voice: "This poor man's sorrow
                  really excites my compassion; we must pray for him."</p>
               <p>"Indeed, sirs," said Poverty, who had overheard what was said, "I should be very
                  much obliged to you if you would do so; as for me, it is plain that my prayers
                  have very little credit with Heaven, seeing I cannot find any way of bettering the
                  miserable condition in which you find me."</p>
               <p>"The Lord sometimes tries the just for their good," said Saint Peter; "it may be
                  that He is thus trying you; but have you any particular favor to ask of Him?"</p>
               <p>"The rogues who have robbed my pears have made me so angry," replied the Goodman,
                  "that, if I might have my way, I would ask that all those who climb up into my
                  pear-tree might be forced to stay there as long as I choose to keep them."</p>
               <p>"That is certainly contenting yourself with very little," replied Saint Peter.</p>
               <p>"Not so little as you may think," rejoined Poverty; "what joy for me to see a
                  rogue stuck up there on a branch, unable to budge, and begging for mercy!"</p>
               <p>"Well," replied Saint Peter, "if the Lord condescends to listen to the voice of
                  His servants (which He does), you may be sure that your wish will be granted; for
                  we shall do our very best for you, in the way of praying."</p>
               <pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7187-00000106"/>
               <p>All that night did Saint Peter and Saint Paul remain on their knees in prayer;
                  they would not take a moment's repose, notwithstanding the good offices of
                  Poverty, who, in order to furnish them each with a couch, had divided into three
                  parts the bundle of straw that formed his bed. But when the morning was come,
                  Saint Peter and Saint Paul informed their charitable host that his wish was
                  granted; and then, Poverty having shaken them heartily by the hand (although he
                  could not help fearing that they were only making game of him), they left the
                  cottage, and went on their way.</p>
               <p>But lo and behold! next morning, when Poverty was coming back with his pitcher
                  from the well, he espied a good-for-nothing varlet from the village stuck fast in
                  the pear-tree, working his arms and legs about with might and main, and looking
                  for all the world like a bird caught fast in the lime.</p>
               <p>"Aha! villain! I have thee!" cried Poverty; "but, good Heaven, what manner of men
                  were they who came to me last night! As for thee, thou rascally thief, I shall
                  keep thee up there, and treat thee just as thou deservest. In the first place I
                  shall call the whole village together, and then I shall kindle a good fire of
                  straw, and roast thee like a sucking-pig!"</p>
               <p>Thereupon the thief begged hard for mercy, offering to pay, at the very least, the
                  worth of ten crops of pears.</p>
               <p>"No, no; don't trouble thyself to offer me money," answered Poverty; "I am poor
                  enough, Heaven knows; but, nevertheless, I prefer to pay myself after my own
                  fashion. Wait just the least little half-quarter of an hour; I shall soon have
                  gathered fagots enough to give thy hide a good singeing! Aha! thou lovest fine,
                  juicy pears! I'll cure thee of thy thirst for them, thou rascal!"</p>
               <p>Away went Poverty to gather straw and sticks for his fire; and, when he was gone,
                  the thief cried for help with all the force he could muster, and so lustily that
                  he drew to the spot two wood-cutters, who were going home from the forest.</p>
               <p>"Why, what art doing up there, Nicholas?" inquired the men.</p>
               <p>"That wicked old wizard, Poverty, for he is a wizard, has put a spell on me,"
                  replied the thief; "here am I, glued fast to the tree, and all because of a few
                  miserable pears, forsooth, that I had eaten, being very thirsty!"</p>
               <p>Thereupon the wood-cutters began to amuse themselves at the caitiff's expense;
                  joking him for the fright he was in, and declaring that Poverty was but a sorry
                  sort of wizard, after all; "for otherwise," said they, "he would have had the wit
                  to mend his own fortune, and keep himself from starving long ago!"</p>
               <p>Having delivered themselves of this piece of reasoning, and wishing to help
                  Nicholas down from his perch, they climbed up into the tree, thinking to set the
                  vagabond at liberty; but they would sooner have torn his arms from his body than
                  have got him loose from the bough.</p>
               <p>"Faith, lad, there's no help for it," said the wood-cutters; "all we can do for
                  thee is, to go to the squire."</p>
               <p>But when they would have got down out of the tree, they found themselves caught
                  just as fast as Nicholas; so that Poverty, on coming back a few minutes after,
                  with a great bundle of brushwood and fagots, found, as he thought, three
                  pear-thieves in his tree, instead of one!</p>
               <p>"Aha!" cried he, with a chuckle; "the fair goes on bravely, I see; there's no lack
                  of traders! very good, my fine fellows; just stay where you are; in two minutes I
                  shall smoke you all like so many herrings!"</p>
               <p>"Excellent Poverty," began both the wood-cutters together, while their tears
                  trickled down to the very foot<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7187-00000107"/> of the
                  tree, "look at us, we beseech of you, and you will see that we are good neighbors
                  of yours; indeed, and in truth, we only got up into this cursed tree to help
                  Nicholas down."</p>
               <p>"Don't tell me," cried Poverty; "no, no; you wanted to steal my pears!"</p>
               <p>"But, good Poverty, we never passed for thieves in all the country-side; we have
                  pear-trees in our own gardens that bear pears quite as fine as these. And even had
                  we neither pear-trees nor pears, had we wanted any, the market is not far off, and
                  we could get our fill of them for a few farthings."</p>
               <p>"If what you say is true," replied Poverty, "you may come down; the punishment is
                  only meant for thieves."</p>
               <p>And, in sooth, the two wood-cutters found themselves suddenly let loose, and were
                  able to jump down to the ground; whereupon the first thing they did was to
                  intercede for the rascal who remained in the tree, as frightened and weary as a
                  toad in a wine-vat.</p>
               <p>"It's no use begging for him," cried Poverty; "no, no; he shall stay up there a
                  year for every pear he has stolen!"</p>
               <p>But the wood-cutters, nothing daunted, pleaded so well, and the poor man's heart
                  was so rich in charity, that at last he consented to forgive the thief on
                  condition that, for the future, he never came within a hundred paces of the little
                  garden; but the vagabond swore that he would never again be seen within even a
                  league of the cottage, so terrible did the Very sight of the pear-tree now seem to
                  him.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the noise of this adventure soon spread abroad in the village, and
                  frightened the people so much, that no one ever again sought to rob Poverty of his
                  pears; the very children, bold as they generally are and greedy of fruit, would on
                  no account have even thrown a stone up into the tree, for they were still more
                  afraid of this pear-tree than of the wolf that ate up little Red Riding Hood.</p>
               <p>For a long space, Poverty lived merrily, and his heart rejoiced within him
                  whenever he looked at his pear-tree, so green, and so thriving, laden with red and
                  yellow fruit, that stood him in place of everything else; but the years passed on,
                  and the Goodman's head was covered with snow. From time to time sickness took hold
                  of him.</p>
               <p>One day there was a tap at the cottage-door, and Poverty opened it to see who was
                  there. It was Death.</p>
               <p>Now many people are troubled on beholding the King of the country of
                  Clatter-bones, but Poverty was not a whit afraid of him, for he had nothing amiss
                  on his conscience, and had always lived an honest man, though a poor one.</p>
               <p>"What! art thou not afraid of me?" cried Death, very much astonished; "of me,
                  before whom popes, kings, and emperors tremble!"</p>
               <p>"You do not frighten me the least in the world," answered Poverty. "What pleasure
                  have I in this life, that I should not also quit it with pleasure? I have neither
                  wife nor children; in sooth, I have had trouble enough without that sort of fry to
                  take care of; I have not the worth of a farthing, except my cottage and my
                  pear-tree, which is, as I may say, a nursing mother to me, through the fine fruit
                  it gives me every year. See! it is now covered with pears, and the only sorrow I
                  have in setting eyes on you, is the thought of being obliged to leave it without
                  having first eaten this year's crop. Unluckily, you are one of those gentry with
                  whom it is no use talking, otherwise I should beg you to let me take one good bite
                  out of my finest pear; after that I should be quite ready to follow you."</p>
               <pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7187-00000108"/>
               <p>"What thou sayest seems to me very reasonable," said Death; "go and gather the
                  fruit for thyself."</p>
               <p>Hereupon Poverty, with Death following close at his heels, stepped out into the
                  paddock, and walked round and round the tree, seeking out the finest pear.</p>
               <p>"I see one that looks very ripe and red," cried he, at last; "but how high it
                  hangs! However, if I might make bold to borrow your worship's scythe for a moment,
                  I think I should be able to get at the branch."</p>
               <p>"Oh, as to my scythe," replied Death, "I never lend that to anybody; but it seems
                  to me, it would be better to gather this pear by hand, lest it should get bruised
                  in the falling."</p>
               <p>"You are certainly right," returned Poverty; "it would be altogether better; but
                  my poor old bones have grown stiff of late, and I cannot climb it as I could at
                  fifteen."</p>
               <p>"Well," said Death, "I'll go up myself, and gather for thee this fine pear, from
                  which thou thinkest to have so much pleasure;" and so saying he clambered up into
                  the pear-tree.</p>
               <p>"Hallo!" cried Death, "but what is it that is taking; hold of me? Why, I can't get
                  down."</p>
               <p>"As, to that," returned Poverty, very coolly, "that's your affair, not mine. Why
                  did you come to my cottage? You have the whole world to, mow in, and yet you must
                  needs come poking into my miserable hovel, to take the life of one who never did
                  you any harm."</p>
               <p>"Darest thou trifle thus with me!" cried Death. "Bethink thee to what thou
                  exposest thyself!"</p>
               <p>"I've bethought me of all that, already," replied Poverty, "and I'm not in the
                  least afraid of you. I have you fast in my pear-tree, old gentleman, and there you
                  shall stay. I shall thus be doing a great service to a lot of other honest folk
                  whom you meant to visit to-day."</p>
               <p>Death, who never before had found himself in such a strait, saw at once that there
                  must be something unearthly about this tree. "I have deserved what has happened,"
                  said he to himself, "by a piece of condescension quite out of my usual way. But
                  let me tell thee," cried he, addressing himself to Poverty, "thou wilt gain
                  nothing by thus setting thyself against the will of Heaven. If it be the Lord's
                  pleasure that thou quit this life, he will make thee quit it, in spite of all thou
                  canst do; and besides, if thou dost not let me come down of thine own free will, I
                  shall very soon have killed thy pear-tree with my scythe."</p>
               <p>"Pshaw!" returned Poverty; "whether my pear-tree be living or dead, you don't come
                  out of it except at my pleasure, and that won't be very soon, I promise you."</p>
               <p>"Why did I ever set my foot in this plaguy dwelling?" said Death to himself; "I
                  had plenty to do in the four corners of the earth, without coming here. Thou wilt
                  repent of this day's business," cried he to Poverty, "when it is too late."</p>
               <p>"I shall do no such thing," replied Poverty; "he who is afraid of dying, is also
                  above the fear of many other things. Your threats do not cause me the slightest
                  alarm, and I am quite ready to start for the other world when the Master shall
                  call me."</p>
               <p>"Thou may'st boast thyself, Goodman, to be the first who has ever vanquished
                  Death. Heaven orders me, with thy leave, to quit thee, and not to come back to
                  thee until the day of doom, when I shall have finished my great work."</p>
               <p>"Is it not to cheat me, that you speak to me thus?" asked Poverty.</p>
               <p>"No," replied Death, "I swear to thee that thou shalt see me no more until the
                  desolation of all nature shall be<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7187-00000109"/>
                  accomplished; it is thou who shalt receive the last stroke of my scythe."</p>
               <p>"In that case," returned Poverty, "you may come down from the tree."</p>
               <p>Death did not wait to be told twice, but flew away through the air, and Poverty
                  has never heard another word from him to this day. It is true that Death has often
                  come back to the village, and has carried off even the most respectable people,
                  but he flies past the Goodman's cottage, as though the pest were in it.</p>
               <p>Poverty has lived on ever since, in the same humble way, under the shadow of his
                  beloved pear-tree; and Poverty will still live on in the world as long as the
                  world shall last.</p>

               <head>X. THE DOUBLE VEIL.</head>
               <p>"MY dear sir," said a pale gentleman in a well-fitting black suit, touching my
                  elbow and addressing me abruptly, as I stood looking over the taffrail of the
                  Stonington steamer—"My dear sir, <emph>never,</emph> on any account, buy food of
                  old people, nor practice impositions on cats."</p>
               <p>"Why," I answered, laughing, "I don't intend to practice impositions either on
                  cats or men; but I see no reason why edibles vended by an old person, should not
                  be as savory and as properly salable as others."</p>
               <p>"Especially if you are peddling," continued my new friend, with a smile;
                     "<emph>especially</emph> if you are peddling. I'll tell you the reason, if you
                  like, and I think it will please you; for there is really a good deal of truth in
                  this advice of mine."</p>
               <p>It is a good plan to tolerate all manner of queer self-introductions. I have
                  gathered many singular stories, and much useful information and new truth, from
                  fellow-travellers of easy manners and a <foreign xml:lang="LAT">cacoëthes
                     loquendi.</foreign> So I answered that I should be extremely happy to listen to
                  the account which my friend, seemed prepared to furnish, whereupon he proceeded to
                  narrate the following:</p>
               <p>"While I was engaged in the peddling business, ten or fifteen years ago, in the
                  rough country including those portions of Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and North
                  Carolina, which are nearest each other, I was in the habit<pb n="218-219"
                     xml:id="VAC7187-00000110"/> of putting up at a solitary frame house, on the
                  mountains in East Tennessee. It was inhabited by two poor creatures, a man and his
                  wife; old, decrepit, and scarcely able to crawl. They had a small garden, and an
                  enormous tomcat; in both of which they took very great pride. They raised a little
                  corn, and a few vegetables; but for other housekeeping comforts and necessaries,
                  they depended upon chance passengers, peddlers, immigrants, hunters, etc. The
                  house was full twenty miles from any other on the road, either way, and the route
                  was extremely rough. How these two feeble old mortals should ever have settled
                  there, or how they should dare to stay so long, I'm sure I can't imagine. Their
                  nearest neighbors used to tell queer stories about the old place, as if it had
                  formerly been the haunt of horse-thieves, negro-stealers, counterfeiters, and that
                  riff-raff of miscellaneous miscreants that gathers now and then in the West and
                  South; and as if the old man, and his old wife had been implicated in many dark
                  deeds, and lived there, by a retributive imprisonment, in the place of their
                  ancient crimes. But of all this, I never saw any indications. I repeatedly passed
                  the night there in safety, even when having property and money to a considerable
                  amount with me. The old folks, to be sure, were 'as cross as two sticks;' but they
                  served me as well as they could. Besides, I was pretty well used to serve myself;
                  and it was one good sign, that they evidently loved their enormous old tomcat as
                  if it had been an only child. There was only one thing about them which positively
                  displeased me, and that was their terrible avarice. I always paid them well, for
                  they were poor, and needed the money. And the grin and clutch with which they
                  seized the cash, and the gloating delight which they felt, seemingly, even in
                  handling the coins, were ugly and hateful to see.</p>
               <p>"Well, I always used to put up there, because it was almost necessarily my
                  stopping-place, in getting across one of the twisted combinations of mountain
                  ranges that shut off the western part of North Carolina from Tennessee. These
                  visits occurred at irregular intervals during several years, while I was on my
                  circuit in that section of country. I could see that the old couple grew weaker
                  and weaker, and their horrid avarice stronger and stronger. They even used to give
                  way, latterly, to unpleasant demonstrations of maudlin affection at my coming,
                  apparently for no other reason than that they expected handsome payment for my
                  board and lodgings. And the great old cat, though coy at first, ultimately took up
                  a cattish and freaky liking to me; rubbing himself against my boot, purring and
                  looking up and winking slowly at me with his big, green eyes, and even scrambling
                  up into my lap to go to sleep, and lying and kneading and digging his sharp claws
                  into me, as a token of amity, after the fashion of amicable cats.</p>
               <p>"I had stopped there one night, towards the end of the summer; and after partaking
                  of an unusually meagre supper and breakfast, departed, leaving the poor old man
                  and his wife mumbling and grinning to each other over a dollar or two which I gave
                  them, as much in charity as in payment.</p>
               <p>"I mused much, as I went, upon the unaccountable change in the behavior of the old
                  cat He had forgotten all his feline blandishments, and of my caresses and
                  attentions he would none; spitting and swelling up in a manner very ugly to
                  behold, developing his great yellow tail into a cylindrical brush almost as large
                  as his body, arching his back and striking spitefully at me with his claws out at
                  full length, whenever I tried to be friendly. The old woman scolded, and the old
                  man swore; until finally<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7187-00000111"/> he threw a
                  couple of old boots and a broom at torn, who evacuated the kitchen, went out and
                  perched on the woodpile, and commenced a horrid and persistent grand solo
                  cat's-concert, calculated to dismay the boldest heart. He wauled and miauled all
                  the evening. He carried on imaginary conflicts with intrusive rivals, and amorous
                  cooings—if one may imagine a tomcat to coo—with lady-lovers; and he kept me awake
                  nearly all night, in spite of the expenditure of all the missiles I could muster
                  in my cracklit attic bedroom.</p>
               <p>"Nor was he improved in the morning. His unmelodious notes seemed to have been
                  aggravated by his serenading—singing in the night, you know, is very trying to the
                  voice—and I fancy he must have caught a cold in the head, from sitting undressed
                  on a damp log; for his eyes were considerably inflamed, and were now horribly red
                  and fiery, and his vile crowing and screeching was as hoarse and harsh as a sick
                  Shanghai's. All the time that I was eating my scanty breakfast and harnessing my
                  horse, he sat on his log, kneading and clawing, flirting his abominable tail, and
                  cursing and swearing at me after his cattish sort, with an expression of face
                  perfectly diabolical.</p>
               <p>"Upon all these savage demonstrations I meditated a good deal; but at last
                  concluded that they must be charged to the changeable character of the beast. He
                  had first liked me, and then hated me without any particular reason; for I had
                  made no advances towards him, either friendly or hostile. I however considered
                  that I might lightly endure the enmity of a yellow tomcat, even of the largest
                  dimensions, and so dismissed the matter from my mind.</p>
               <p>"A few weeks afterwards, while I was in Nashville, and had nearly sold out my
                  stock, I received a letter from a firm in Charleston with whom I had transacted
                  some business ness, requesting me to come immediately thither, and make
                  arrangements to undertake an agency further south, in their employment. I made
                  preparations to start next morning, for their terms were liberal, and at that time
                  I cared little what or where was my occupation, if only I could rove enough. A
                  day's notice would have sufficed me for a voyage around the world.</p>
               <p>"As I lay in bed next morning waiting for the breakfast-bell, the recollection of
                  old Mr. and Mrs. Graves, and their enormous and fickle pussy, came into my mind.
                  The strange behavior of that respectable quadruped had served to impress the
                  occurrences of my last visit deeply on my memory; and by spontaneous mental
                  operation, I now remembered a circumstance which had before escaped me. During my
                  last breakfast at the mountain tavern, tile old lady remarked to her husband, as I
                  finished the fag-end of a lean scrap of bacon, and a crust of corn bread, that she
                  didn't know what on earth they should do for dinner, unless they should kill tom;
                  for there wasn't another mouthful of anything on the place. Now, thought I to
                  myself, what could the miserable old creatures do if they should actually get out
                  of provisions? For they could not possibly travel to any other house, in either
                  direction. They had told me that once or twice already they had been reduced to
                  great straits by the non-arrival of any passengers, at times when their own stores
                  had failed. But there was the garden? Yes; but as it happened, there was also
                  nothing in it; for an unprecedentedly long and late drought had that season
                  destroyed nearly all the summer crops, and even many of the forest trees, in the
                  drier parts of that high, mountainous region. And their Western improvidence would
                  prevent them from actual preparation for an emergency of the kind I was
                  contemplating, since 'they had done well enough so far.' Now,<pb n="222-223"
                     xml:id="VAC7187-00000112"/> I continued, could that frightful yellow cat have
                  foreseen, by some inscrutable animal intuition, such as dogs and horses have often
                  been supposed to possess, that a famine was impending over the household, and that
                  I was consuming the last portion of food, and leaving only useless, inedible
                  specie in return? And was it <emph>that</emph> foreboding which made him so savage
                  and persistent in his wrath and his vociferations?</p>
               <p>"I very soon, however, got rid of these unpromising speculations in the bustle of
                  breakfast and of preparing for my long ride. For there was no public conveyance by
                  my old route, which, as the shortest, I proposed to take; and having disposed of
                  my team, I purchased a saddle-horse, took provisions and a double-barrelled
                  pistol, and set out.</p>
               <p>"But as I rode along through solitary woods, or on the unfrequented paths among
                  plantations, the odd notions that had perplexed me in the morning unaccountably
                  rose up again in my mind. Suppose the old people <emph>should</emph> have got
                  entirely out of food? Suppose that rascally old tomcat did really have the 'second
                  sight,' and had been shrieking out like a feline and fuscous Cassandra, a true and
                  unregarded prophecy of woe? What a miserable and unhappy end of their lonely,
                  forgotten lives, to starve in their solitary home on the mountains, alone! To feel
                  their impotence, and wait in helpless, hopeless weakness, for passengers who did
                  not come—to see the shadows shorten on the floor in the morning, and lengthen
                  again in the slanting sunbeams of afternoon, and to hear no approaching step—and
                  then suddenly I remembered wild stories of attacks made by cats upon babes or the
                  helpless sick, or even upon unwatched corpses of the dead. I was active and young;
                  yet these horrid fancies clustered continually about me, despite my endeavors to
                  drive them away, and filled me full of foolish fears to approach the solitary
                  frame house. I argued the whole case over and over; and repeatedly and uselessly
                  convicted myself of nervousness, of folly, of, silly dreaming. But as soon as the
                  procession of the reasoning had passed by, and even before, up jumped again the
                  pallid ghosts of the mountain couple. At last, quite put of patience, I drove my
                  horse to his utmost capacity; hurrying, since I could do no better, to dispel, by
                  close encounter, and familiar experience of the aged faces and tottering forms of
                  the old man and woman, the uncomfortable phantoms that haunted me, and that
                  crowded and plagued me more and more every hour.</p>
               <p>"After several days' hard travel I approached the old house. I watched the road
                  earnestly for traces of footsteps, or horse or carriage-tracks; but I could see
                  only the half-effacea remains of old ones, washed out by rain, or filled with
                  wind-driven dust. Yet this afforded only a faint presumption; and how absurd did
                  the idea seem that two people, in a habitable house on the public road, should
                  starve in solitude for lack of provisions!</p>
               <p>"I crossed the summit of a ridge, from which I could look down as from the rim of
                  a basin upon the bottom and sides of the wide valley in the higher region of the
                  Cumberland Mountains, in the middle of which the old home stood. The low rays of
                  the western sun, in the floods of the thick yellow light which is the peculiar
                  illumination of the middle and latter half of the golden afternoon, poured over
                  all the amphitheatre, and seemed even to concentrate in still and flaming glories
                  upon the bare old house, and within the small clearing around it. Utter and
                  doleful silence slept over all the region. The heat was intense; and neither did
                  breeze stir the woodlands, nor did bird or beast move or speak in the forest. I
                  reined up and looked forward with the indistinct yet intense<pb n="224-225"
                     xml:id="VAC7187-00000113"/> tense volition which we exercise when upon the
                  margin of some undetermined revelation, as if a strong and earnest wish might
                  suffice to show us what we desire to know. Slowly and hesitatingly I set forward
                  again. I met none. I saw none but old tracks. I heard nothing except the
                  reduplicating tramp of my weary horse as I urged him on at a quick walk—his
                  panting, the creaking of his accoutrements. Forward, forward; nearer and nearer to
                  the vortex of these most gratuitous and absurd, but now involuntary and almost
                  unendurable terrors of mine.</p>
               <p>"I came suddenly out from beneath the shadowy branches of the high forest trees
                  upon the open ground before the house. The hot yellow light struck me almost
                  faint. The doors and windows were closed. Dust and silence possessed all the outer
                  portions of the homestead. The rusty axe lay upon the chips before the door; an
                  old bucket stood upon the steps; a squirrel skittered across the front of the
                  building and ran squeaking into the rickety garden fence; and an inarticulate
                  moaning noise was heard, and something was feebly dropped against the kitchen
                  window from within. Doubtless, that was the voice and hand of one of the ancient
                  inmates, fallen near the window, while looking in vain, with dim and dimming eyes,
                  for help that did not come.</p>
               <p>"I was just in season, then, to relieve the poor old couple from perishing. In a
                  half expectation of such a case, I had stored my saddle-bags with food. I leaped
                  from my saddle, hastily fastened my horse, snatched the saddle-bags, drew my
                  pistol for fear of any surprise, and hurried to the window. But quicker yet I
                  recoiled. The hideous beast, crouched upon the breast of his dead mistress,
                  cowering there, a gaunt and bony fiend, but with red and angry eyes and
                     <emph>bloody jaws,</emph> recognized me; sprang with renewed and demoniac
                  strength against the dusty window, through which, in a sort of fear to open the
                  door, I had first peered in upon the secrets of the fearful house. In utter
                  abandonment of frantic anger he flung himself, and flew sideways, with impotent
                  and wide extended fangs and talons, and a shrill and direful cry, against the
                  window, so that the thin glass cracked and shivered, and the hateful thing dashed,
                  but for the transparent film, right in my face.</p>
               <p>"My momentary glance within showed me that my speculations had been well founded.
                  They were coëxistent with some fearful chance, or God had chosen to make me an
                  instrument of death to the two wretched old beings there. For if not, should I not
                  have hastened back to them with food on the day I left them last?</p>
               <p>"The old man lay dead upon the bed, and his wife upon the floor. * * * * * * But
                  such was the debilitating effect of my previous cogitations, and of the
                  recognition and fiendish virulence of the enormous cat, that my courage was
                  utterly shattered. I fired with unsteady hand upon the beast as he lay kicking on
                  the floor; wounded him; fled straightway to my horse, stumbling in sheer blind
                  affright, and strove to unfasten him.</p>
               <p>"But awful yells from the imprisoned cat paralyzed my fingers. Again and again the
                  frightful thing sprang against the window. The weak panes shattered; the hateful
                  yellow beast caught upon the broken fragments left in the sash; tore himself, and
                  bled; scrambled furiously, through; flew across the narrow yard; and just as I was
                  mounting, as well as my miserable fear would allow me, sprang at me, caught me by
                  the leg and bit and bit with an agonizing and malevolent energy which could only
                  have been inspired by fiends; relaxed his hold, and fell dying to the ground.</p>
               <p>"In utter and unimaginable rapture of terror, I set<pb n="226-227"
                     xml:id="VAC7187-00000114"/> spurs to my horse, screamed to him, whipped him
                  frantically; and so fled far away from the ghastly place.</p>
               <p>"But the creature had bitten me with poisonous teeth. And ever since, he is close
                  behind me, and every little while he yells and screams in my ears until I rave. I
                  won't bear it any longer," screamed my gentlemanly friend, looking quickly behind
                  him, and then bending upon me wild eyes, whose increasingly unsteady glitter I had
                  uneasily marked during all the latter portion of this incoherent story——"There he
                  is again! Don't you see him? He'll bite you, too! Let's jump overboard; he can't
                  get us there!"</p>
               <p>And before I could do more than cry out once, he gripped me, lifted me from the
                  deck and sprung with me, out and down into the white shadowy horror of boiling
                  foam that hissed and gurgled and wallowed, in the twilight under the great
                  steamer's stern.</p>
               <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>
               <p>The cold water awakened me. I lay floundering on the state-room floor, amalgamated
                  with a broken basin and pitcher—the water thence proceeding—a chair, my trunks and
                  my boots. And a baby was squalling fearfully in the next state-room, not a foot
                  from the berth where I had been sleeping. The vehement shouts of this innocent had
                  furnished the squalls of the cat, around which, as a nucleus, the other
                  circumstances of my dream had grouped themselves, in the rapid crystallization of
                  spontaneous mental action.</p>
               <milestone n="——" unit="typography"/>

               <head>XI. MY HUSBAND'S MOTHER.</head>
               <p>IT I was the morning after Helen's wedding, and as I stood in the large parlors,
                  now so still and breathless, where only the evening before, merry words and light
                  laughter had reëchoed, I began for the first time to realize that Helen had
                  gone.</p>
               <p>I threw myself on a sofa near the conservatory; the wind, laden with sweet
                  perfume, swept over my cheek as I pulled the cushions into shape, and, assuming an
                  easy position, prepared to indulge in a favorite amusement of
                  mine—day-dreaming.</p>
               <p>My thoughts reverted to the distant past, and the scenes of my childhood came
                  vividly before me.</p>
               <p>I seemed to see my own quiet home—my gentle mother bending over her sewing, as she
                  was wont to do from early morn to the late evening, ever cheerful, ever busy,
                  until she sickened and died.</p>
               <p>That death-bed! How well I remembered it!</p>
               <p>Her last fond embrace and her fast-falling tears, as she lay on the lowly bed, her
                  thin hand resting on the white counterpane, and the white curtains blowing out
                  gently into the room, fanning her pale cheek.</p>
               <p>Good Mrs. Evans stood by the bedside weeping bitterly and reiterating her promise
                  to follow the directions of my mother concerning me. I only comprehended that my
                  mother was to leave me, and clung to her hand, looking at her wonderingly.</p>
               <pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7187-00000115"/>
               <p>How could I know that she was to die? I had seen her sick so many times, and knew
                  so little what death was!</p>
               <p>I watched her as she breathed fainter and fainter, her eyes all the while fixed on
                  me with a loving expression that I can never forget.</p>
               <p>"Heavenly Father," she breathed, "to thee I commit my child." Her clasp of my hand
                  tightened, then relaxed, and all was over. Again I thought of the time when I had
                  first entered these rooms, contrasting so strongly with the low walls and simple
                  furniture of my cottage-home, that I was almost dazzled and knew not which to
                  admire most, the lady dressed in silks and laces, to whom I was presented, or the
                  elegance that surrounded her.</p>
               <p>I was half afraid of my aunt, till she clasped me in her warm embrace,
                  half-smothering me in her enormous sleeves as she pressed me in her arms.</p>
               <p>I believe she would have wept over me, but unfortunately, as she held me off to
                  look at me, my long hair having got entangled in any number of chains which
                  depended from her neck, my horrified expression was so far removed from anything
                  pathetic, that she burst into a fit of laughter. I, for my part, felt more
                  inclined to cry, as my uncle who stood by came to the rescue; at length, with the
                  aid of scissors, I was separated from my aunt with the loss of a little of my
                  abundant hair, and I doubt not since I have known her better, of a very prettly
                  little speech of welcome also, which she had prepared to deliver.</p>
               <p>Good Mrs. Evans, who had brought me to Boston, was treated with every possible
                  attention, and on parting with me the next day, as she was to return to her home,
                  assured me that I "was in good hands, for my aunt's folks was the nicest folks
                  that ever was."</p>
               <p>I was soon fairly settled, and my sadness, which I had determined never to get
                  over, feeling as if any cessation of grief denoted a lack of affection for my
                  mother, gradually vanished before the bright smiles and merry chat of my four
                  cousins. The two older ones, having finished their education, had
                     <emph>come</emph> out, and parties, rides, and other amusements followed each
                  other in quick succession.</p>
               <p>Maggie, Helen, and I were still school-girls, but yet Aunt McLellan allowed us to
                  join occasionally in rides, and to make our appearance at small social parties,
                  which we enjoyed most heartily.</p>
               <p>Our house was always thronged with company, and my aunt herself was the life of
                  our parties of pleasure.</p>
               <p>My uncle, a studious and reserved man, passed most of his time in his study, and
                  so long as he was allowed to remain in undisturbed possession of that room, cared
                  little how his family spent their time, if they were only happy.</p>
               <p>So years passed on, and no shadow dimmed the sunshine of that happy household,
                  till death entered.</p>
               <p>My uncle, after a short and severe illness, died.</p>
               <p>My aunt was inconsolable; in fact, we were all overwhelmed with grief. Death, we
                  knew, must come to all, but we had never dreamed that it would come so soon, so
                  suddenly; and that my uncle, in the pride of manly vigor, must go down to the
                  narrow grave.</p>
               <p>We felt at first as people always do, that we could never be happy again. We
                  mourned for my uncle sincerely, but yet two years had hardly passed before the old
                  homestead was as gay as ever.</p>
               <p>The death of my uncle had brought to light the fact that we were no longer
                  wealthy. My aunt's large fortune had melted, no one knew how or where, but it had
                  gone. We were poor.</p>
               <p>I do not know what my aunt would have done, if stinging<pb n="230-231"
                     xml:id="VAC7187-00000116"/> ing poverty had come upon us; for she realized
                  nothing of its evils, and the announcement of the fact of her situation did not
                  trouble her in the least; she was spared the painful task of endeavoring to
                  satisfy expensive habits with inadequate means; for an old uncle of hers settled
                  upon her an annuity for her lifetime.</p>
               <p>Upon this she lived just as ever, gratifying every present wish, with but
                     <emph>one</emph> thought for the future.</p>
               <p>The loss of her property seemed to have produced but one result: that of making
                  her anxious to settle her daughters well in marriage, and very soon both Charlotte
                  and Lizzie were disposed of. Both married wealthy men—both made "good matches," as
                  they are called.</p>
               <p>This was somewhat to our surprise; for Charlotte had nothing but her never-failing
                  good-humor to attract; for she was positively plain; yet her husband was
                  considered one of the "greatest catches" in town.</p>
               <p>Lizzie was very talented, and had always treated the common herd as quite beneath
                  her notice; yet she married a silly fellow, with nothing but his good looks and
                  his wealth to recommend him; what was stranger than all, she almost adored
                  him—gave <emph>him</emph> credit for all the brilliant remarks that
                     <emph>she</emph> made in conversation, and finally cheated herself and some
                  others—her husband among the number—into the belief that he was a man of fine
                  mind, who had never before been appreciated.</p>
               <p>Maggie, Helen, and I, now being left, soon found that our only chance of resting'
                  quietly depended on being, at at least, engaged.</p>
               <p>Maggie declared that she had a decided vocation for the life of an old maid, and,
                  absorbed in her own pursuits, scarcely thought of marriage; and when Mr. Carroll,
                  a bachelor of good fortune, presented himself as a suitor, she resolutely
                  persisted in rejecting all his attentions.</p>
               <p>My aunt and he were <emph>equally</emph> determined that she should marry him;
                  and, after a long and vigorous siege, the fortress surrendered.</p>
               <p>Maggie became Mrs. Carroll.</p>
               <p>Helen and I had enjoyed tolerable quiet during this skirmish; but it was now our
                  turn.</p>
               <p>As Helen was <emph>the beauty</emph> of the family, my aunt had decided that she
                  was to make <emph>the grand</emph> match. Indeed, she had admirers by scores.</p>
               <p>She sang and danced with the gay young gentlemen, played whist and talked
                  politics, or, what is more strictly true, <emph>listened</emph> to politics, with
                  the elderly ones; was the wildest and merriest in all parties of pleasure, the
                  kindest in sickness, the most benevolent to the poor of all our circle; and, with
                  all these charms, married <emph>a poor minister,</emph> to Aunt McLellan's
                  infinite disgust.</p>
               <p>It required a great deal of strategy to win her consent, and not until visions of
                  her daughter, as the wife of the <emph>Right Reverend Bishop</emph> Wilmot, which
                     <emph>I</emph> conjured up, as in the future, had, from my glowing
                  representations, assumed in her mind all the vividness of reality, did she
                  yield.</p>
               <p>It was now the day after the wedding, and Aunt McLellan had acted the part of a
                  loving mother, which she really was, to perfection.</p>
               <p>She was in her element during the whole progress of a wedding, from the
                  preparatory process of making garments of all sorts, shapes, and sizes, to the
                  last embrace in the presence of admiring friends, as the bride left home for the
                  wedding tour on which our mother always insisted as quite as necessary to the
                  proper union of the parties as the words spoken by the parson.</p>
               <p>"Here am I, then, left alone," I said, half aloud, concluding my long reverie;
                  and, starting up, I snatched my<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7187-00000117"/> duster,
                  which had fallen from my hand, and began to wipe some stray particles of dust from
                  the polished rosewood of the piano; then, running my fingers over the keys, I
                  began to sing a simple melody.</p>
               <p>"Very well done, Sibyl," said my aunt, who had entered the room unperceived, and
                  now stood by my side. "But now come up to my chamber; I want to talk to you."</p>
               <p>I followed her to her room, and took my usual seat, a low rocking-chair by the
                  window.</p>
               <p>A few commonplace observations followed, on the wedding, and I watched for
                     <emph>the</emph> subject on which she wished to speak. At last it came.</p>
               <p>"Did you see Dr. Carter last night?"</p>
               <p>"Dr. Carter," I mused. "Really, I saw so many strangers, I can hardly tell; but I
                  dare say I did. I think I do remember a tall dark man who was rather reserved, who
                  was introduced to me as Dr. something, I didn't hear what; you know people always
                  mumble over <emph>names</emph> at an introduction, as if that was a very
                  unimportant matter. Well, what of him?"</p>
               <p>"That I am commissioned to offer you his heart and hand."</p>
               <p>I could only stare in mute surprise. "To me?" at last I gasped.</p>
               <p>"Yes, my dear; it was a case of love at first sight." I burst into a fit of
                  laughter, for suddenly all our conversation flashed upon me.</p>
               <p>"My dear Auntie," said I, "you must be joking. The only words that we exchanged
                  were these: he suggested that it was a fine evening, to which <emph>I</emph>
                  assented. I remarked on the beauty of the bride, to which <emph>he</emph>
                  assented. I am very sure that this was all of our conversation;" and again I began
                  to laugh.</p>
               <p>"'Laugh, then, if you will, you silly girl," at last interrupted rupted my aunt,
                  evidently provoked. "It is <emph>so,</emph> I assure you; and he is a very fine
                  man, of whose admiration you ought to be proud. He is <emph>rather</emph>
                  eccentric."</p>
               <p>"So I should think," interrupted I.</p>
               <p>"What shall I say to him?" asked my aunt.</p>
               <p>"Whatever you choose, so that he may understand that I mean <emph>no,</emph>" was
                  my reply.</p>
               <p>"You are certainly the most provoking girl in the world!" exclaimed Aunt McLellan.
                  "To be sure, he is not very rich; but he has a good practice, which is on the
                  increase, and what do you expect?—you, who have neither beauty nor fortune to
                  attract admirers? Now, here is a man, as good a one as I could select for my own
                  daughter, a better husband than Helen's with all her attractions, and yet you
                  obstinately refuse to <emph>see</emph> him even."</p>
               <p>"Very well! I will see him," replied I, and subsided into silence.</p>
               <p>My aunt rose and left the room very wisely, and I very foolishly went to a mirror
                  to see what there was in my appearance to warrant one's falling in love with me at
                  first sight.</p>
               <p>The greatest vanity would not allow me to think myself handsome, but I did feel
                  myself a little flattered, nevertheless.</p>
               <p>"I will see this man," I resolved. "He must be rather weak; and since he is so
                  much in love, I can treat him as I please."</p>
               <p>So I pleased myself with imagining the cool dignity and grace of manner with which
                  I would conduct myself during the interview.</p>
               <p>It came at last.</p>
               <p>Dr. Carter was announced.</p>
               <p>As I entered the parlor, a tall dark man rose to meet me. He took my hand kindly,
                  but with none of the embarrassment or ardor that I had anticipated, and leading<pb
                     n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7187-00000118"/> me to a seat, began in a calm and quiet
                  manner to tell me what I already knew, that he had been attracted to me, and to
                  explain his reasons for his abrupt declaration of it. His views with regard to
                  so-called engagements were quite different from those of the generality of people,
                  he said. It was his idea that the tie thus formed should not be considered as so
                  binding that withdrawal from it should be regarded as dishonorable to either
                  party. It was the only way, he thought, that two people could arrive at that
                  intimate knowledge of each other's character, which was necessary to insure
                  happiness in a union for life; and when an engagement was formed it should be
                  considered merely that the parties entering into it, having been attracted to each
                  other, did so for the purpose of knowing more of each other. If the result of that
                  knowledge was mutually pleasing, well and good; if not, let either withdraw,
                  without any hard feeling, content to remain friends, if nothing more.</p>
               <p>Having thus explained his views, he asked me if I were willing to engage myself to
                  him, adding that his duties required his presence at home immediately, and he must
                  ask a speedy decision.</p>
               <p>While he had been talking, I had been repeating to myself, "Can this man be in
                  love with me?"</p>
               <p>His cool manner of making love, if so it might be called, was quite different from
                  anything to which I had been accustomed. But I liked him, nevertheless.</p>
               <p>I felt provoked to think I should seem so easily won, if I consented; and I knew,
                  too, that he was not one to be trifled with, and that I must at once say yes or
                  no.</p>
               <p>"Yes," I did not want to say; "No," still less. I was conscious that I appeared to
                  far greater disadvantage than he, as I sat looking at the flowers in the carpet at
                  my foot.</p>
               <p>"Have you decided?" asked the Doctor, as I looked up.</p>
               <p>"Yes," I replied.</p>
               <p>"And how?" continued he, <emph>not</emph> eagerly, but as if it were the most
                  commonplace question in the world.</p>
               <p>"Yes," again I replied; "and I hope that neither of us will have cause to repent
                  my hasty decision."</p>
               <p>"I hope not," he replied gravely, and said no more. Not a word of the
                  protestations that I had expected—not a word of love.</p>
               <p>He immediately changed the subject and began talking of, I hardly know what, but
                  in an easy, unembarrassed manner, for nearly an hour.</p>
               <p>He then took leave of me, saying that he would see me again before he left, which
                  must be on the next day, and that he would write me immediately on his return
                  home.</p>
               <p>I was very romantic, and this cool way of wooing was not just to my taste; but
                  after Dr. Carter left me, the oddity of the thing struck me more forcibly, and I
                  was rather better pleased. His letters, which were tolerably frequent, were kind
                  and friendly.</p>
               <p>He said little of his prospects in life, and remembering that my aunt had said "he
                  was not rich," I concluded that he was poor.</p>
               <p>This idea suited me, and I used to build all sorts of air castles as to how I
                  would work for and with him, in our quiet little home. I became more and more
                  attached to him, and really felt quite anxious to begin a life of toil for his
                  sake. A year passed rapidly away, and at the end of that time I had become Mrs.
                     <emph>Dr.</emph> Carter.</p>
               <p>I will pass over all the details of the wedding, as my experience is precisely
                  similar to that of thousands before me.</p>
               <p>We were neither married in a cave, nor on a mountain—in a picture gallery, nor
                  under Niagara Falls.</p>
               <pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7187-00000119"/>
               <p>All was commonplace in the extreme. The same responses were uttered by the bride
                  and groom—the same remarks made by admiring friends.</p>
               <p>Even poor homely I was pronounced "a beautiful bride," and, if I may credit the
                  same authorities, the groom "appeared remarkably well," also.</p>
               <p>Even my aunt's favorite termination to the wedding festivities, a wedding tour,
                  was wanting, unless the journey of fifty miles by railroad, to my new home, may
                  pass for that, for Dr. Carter could not leave his duties for pleasure.</p>
               <p>I could hardly realize, as I was whirled along behind the snorting locomotive,
                  that I had become a wife; and when I stole a glance at my husband, who sat by my
                  side reading the <title>Scalpel,</title> I certainly though that he was far from
                  duly appreciating the importance of his newly-acquired position.</p>
               <p>"Binghamton!" shouted the conductor, popping his head in at the car door, and
                  disappearing as suddenly.</p>
               <p>My husband rose. "Here we are," said he, as he gathered up my carpet-bag, shawl
                  and veil, and led the way to the depôt.</p>
               <p>Away whizzed the panting steam-engine, and I stood on the platform by the side of
                  the baggage.</p>
               <p>Presently the Doctor led me to a carriage, and a few moments' ride brought us to
                  my new home.</p>
               <p>I had pictured to myself a cottage embowered in trees, situated on a sloping hill,
                  as my future home; but no! a stately brick house stared me in the face, and so
                  there was an end to my day-dreams of love in a cottage.</p>
               <p>I dare say I looked disappointed, for I felt so on entering the parlors, where
                  nothing was wanting that money could procure.</p>
               <p>"Does it not please you?" asked my husband.</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes!" I replied, though I told a bit of a story; then, in a lower tone, I
                  added, "that I had always thought physicians were poor."</p>
               <p>Dr. Carter laughed, and assured me that he had not taken me from a good home
                  without having the means of supplying an equally good one in its place.</p>
               <p>So there was an end to a second of my day-dreams—that of working for his sake, of
                  sacrificing my tastes that I might minister to his; in short, of becoming a
                  heroine in some way, I hardly knew how.</p>
               <p>I pleaded fatigue and went to my room.</p>
               <p>The air of comfort that it wore provoked me, and I shed tears as my future
                  prospects rose before me.</p>
               <p>I was to settle down as a respectable married woman—nothing more.</p>
               <p>I, who had imagined that my wedding-day was to usher in a series of unparalleled
                  trials and exertions, through which I was to pass triumphantly, "winning golden
                  opinions from all sorts" of people.</p>
               <p>There had been no romance in my engagement—there was none in store for me.</p>
               <p>But these heart-rending reflections were interrupted by steps on the
                  staircase.</p>
               <p>I hastily washed my eyes, and tried to look cheerful when my husband came in, and
                  really I was astonished to find how soon I regained my composure, and how soon I
                  forgot in his conversation on books and authors, as he showed me his extensive and
                  well-arranged library, the disagreeable fact that he was rich.</p>
               <p>He had just taken down a copy of Young's Night Thoughts, which I hastily threw
                  aside, declaring "that I hated Young—that there wasn't a word of poetry in his
                  whole book, and that I would give more for three of Byron's poorest lines than for
                  four hundred volumes of such terrible, gloomy, prosaic thoughts put into the
                     blankest<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7187-00000120"/> est of blank verse," to all
                  of which he was listening with a smile, when the rustle of a silk dress startled
                  us both.</p>
               <p>My husband sprang from my side and presented me to the stately lady, his
                  mother.</p>
               <p>He had often spoken of his mother, and I had imagined that she would meet me at
                  the door, clasp me in her warm embrace, calling me her child, and praying for my
                  happiness.</p>
               <p>I had often pictured to myself a very pretty tableau of this kind, but as I saw
                  nothing of her on my arrival, I had concluded that she was absent.</p>
               <p>She had, I judged from her appearance, spent the time which had elapsed in making
                  her toilet, and I should as soon have ventured to embrace Pompey's pillar as to
                  clasp that stately dame in my arms.</p>
               <p>In fact she seemed as far from expecting any such demonstration. I took her
                  offered hand and replied, to her comments on the weather in as polite and frigid a
                  tone as she herself used. I knew at once that whatever her son might have done,
                  she was far from falling in love with me at first sight, and I was equally sure
                  that my feelings towards her would not come under the head of unrequited
                     <emph>affection.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Tea was soon announced, and as if I were a guest, she led the way to the
                  tea-table, gave me a seat by the side of my husband, and took her place at the
                  head of the table.</p>
               <p>My cheeks flushed a little at this summary mode of disposing of me and my new
                  dignity.</p>
               <p>I never was ambitious of the duties of presiding officer at any post, particularly
                  of the onerous ones devolving on the occupant of the post of honor at table, and
                  would most willingly have resigned in favor of Madam Carter, had I been allowed
                  the privilege, but I had not even the empty distinction of an abdication, even if
                  it were a forced one offered me. I said nothing, however.</p>
               <p>But, underneath all my mother-in-law's scrupulous politeness towards me, I
                  discovered the fact that she was jealous of me, and determined to yield nothing to
                  me.</p>
               <p>"If this is a declaration of war, I am ready," thought I, as I took very quietly
                  my cup of tea.</p>
               <p>As weeks passed, I found that her tactics consisted principally in assuming a
                  patronizing manner towards me.</p>
               <p>She very kindly assumed the task of entertaining the ladies who called on me, and,
                  on their departure, informed me to whom I should pay the greatest attention.</p>
               <p>One lady in particular she had warned me against; and, though not very favorably
                  impressed by Mrs. Bryan on her first visit, as I saw it annoyed Madam Carter, I
                  called on her quite soon.</p>
               <p>She returned my visit speedily. I soon found that she sung well, and very readily
                  complied with her request that we should learn duets together. So that we soon
                  struck up quite an intimacy.</p>
               <p>My husband's time was very much occupied, and he gave himself no concern whatever
                  about my acquaintances. This did not please me. In fact, I should have infinitely
                  preferred the most rigid surveillance to the cool indifference which he
                  displayed.</p>
               <p>I began to imagine that he did not love me, and determined to prove him.</p>
               <p>I had imagined that where love existed there must be perfect sympathy between
                  husband and wife in all their varying moods; but when I was moody, he took no
                  notice of it; when I was gay, he smiled, indeed, but that was all; in fact, he was
                  always the same, calm, cheerful and practical, and I therefore drew the very
                  logical conclusion from my premises that he did not love me.</p>
               <p>"Will nothing rouse him?" I asked myself; and my evil<pb n="240-241"
                     xml:id="VAC7187-00000121"/> genius replied, "If you could only make him
                  jealous!" and I resolved to try the experiment.</p>
               <p>Opportunity was not long wanting.</p>
               <p>Mr. Canning, a brother of Mrs. Bryan, came to pay his sister a visit. She
                  introduced him at once to me, and I found him both handsome, talented, and
                  agreeable; he appeared to find me equally interesting, and began to show me
                  considerable attention.</p>
               <p>I enlarged on his attractions, both of mind and person, to my husband—he only
                  yawned in reply; but my mother-in-law looked on his frequent visits with far
                  different eyes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Canning was not slow to perceive Madam Carter's dislike to him, or my dislike
                  to her; and, though never ungentlemanly, it was evident that he would not pay her
                  that marked deference which she demanded of her acquaintances.</p>
               <p>She had not as yet expressed her disapprobation of Mr. Canning, as, in fact, she
                  could bring nothing positive against him.</p>
               <p>One night, however, when we had been at a party where Mr. Canning had been as
                  close an attendant as my shadow, my husband informed me that he wished me to be
                  less intimate both with Mrs. Bryan and her brother.</p>
               <p>I replied "that I found them both agreeable, and saw no reason for pursuing the
                  course that he recommended."</p>
               <p>"They are extremely disagreeable to my mother," said my husband.</p>
               <p>"They are extremely <emph>agreeable</emph> to your <emph>wife,</emph>" retorted
                  I.</p>
               <p>"My mother declares that she will not go into the room when they visit here," said
                  he.</p>
               <p>"A very sensible resolution on your mother's part," was my reply. "She has
                  heretofore been particularly careful to be present on such occasions."</p>
               <p>"Do you mean to say, then, that you persist in retaining these people as intimate
                  friends when it is so contrary to the wishes of your family?"</p>
               <p>"Say, rather, to the wishes of your mother, and I reply <emph>yes.</emph> I
                  recognize no right that she has to dictate from mere caprice, who shall be my
                  associates."</p>
               <p>"But it is no mere whim, Sibyl. Mrs. Bryan has always been accused of
                  improprieties of conduct, to say the least, and her brother is said to be really
                  unprincipled."</p>
               <p>"Nonsense!" retorted I; "some sewing-circle gossip of a few tattling old ladies. I
                  shall not give up my friends for such baseless rumors."</p>
               <p>"I understand you to say, then, decidedly, that you intend to pursue your own
                  course—to cling to these people."</p>
               <p>"Place your request to give them up on its true ground, <emph>jealousy,</emph> and
                  I might answer differently."</p>
               <p>"Jealousy!" repeated my husband in a most contemptuous tone. "So you have imagined
                  me jealous. It is no high compliment, when the cause of it, too, is supposed to be
                  a brainless puppy, like Canning. No, Sibyl, you have much mistaken me. It is my
                  regard for my wife that leads me to warn her against two unprincipled
                  persons."</p>
               <p>"Say in compliance with your mother's <emph>will,</emph>" I replied, "and you will
                  tell the truth."</p>
               <p>"As you will," he answered coldly; "but I tell you I will be obeyed. If you cannot
                  comply with a request, obey a command. Drop these people at once and for
                  ever."</p>
               <p>"Is your mother to be mistress here, or am I?" I exclaimed in a fit of
                  ungovernable passion. "She has domineered over me till I can bear it no longer. We
                  hate each other. We cannot breathe under the same roof; either she or I must go
                  from it."</p>
               <p>"And can you ask me, Sibyl, to turn my mother from my house—she who toiled early
                  and late to give me the<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7187-00000122"/> education which
                  has placed me where I now am—that noble mother, who, by her needle, gained
                  subsistence for herself and children, and shall I now be the base wretch to repay
                  her with ingratitude? Never! never!"</p>
               <p>"Whatever she may have done for you," I rejoined, "she has never, thank Heaven!
                  done aught for <emph>me</emph> that I must repay with <emph>servility.</emph> She
                  must be of a generous soul, indeed, to require the subjection of a slave, not only
                  from her son, but from her son's wife. Bow before her, if you will; I will
                     <emph>never</emph> do it."</p>
               <p>My husband made no reply. He probably thought that, after a short struggle, I
                  should yield; but no! I was resolved.</p>
               <p>The next day I went to ride with Mr. Canning, as I had before agreed to do; I was
                  in no mood to play the agreeable, and he, to my surprise, construed my silence and
                  dejection into a regard for him.</p>
               <p>I speedily checked his insulting expressions of tenderness, and bade him carry me
                  home.</p>
               <p>I now saw the wisdom of my husband's counsel, but I would not allow my
                  mother-in-law to suppose that her will had been obeyed.</p>
               <p>As soon as I reached home I commenced packing my trunk; and, having ordered a
                  carriage, I wrote a note for my husband; it ran thus:</p>
               <q>
                  <floatingText>
                     <body>
                        <div type="letter">
                           <p>"It is an old saying of that old-fashioned book, the Bible, that 'a
                              man shall leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife.' You
                              have decided differently. It is to be presumed that you are right.
                              However that may be, we must part. That you may be happy is the wish

               </q>
               <p>This I folded and laid upon the table, where it would meet his eye on his return
                  from a professional visit.</p>
               <p>I had just finished my last duties, and was expecting the carriage every moment,
                  when the door opened and my husband entered.</p>
               <p>He looked at me, habited as I was for my journey, with no little surprise, but
                  said nothing.</p>
               <p>His eye fell on the note; he opened it, read it deliberately, and laid it down
                  again.</p>
               <p>"Is this indeed your final resolution?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"It is," was my reply.</p>
               <p>He was silent for a few moments, and I would have given worlds to have known his
                  feelings, but his countenance was impenetrable.</p>
               <p>At last he spoke.</p>
               <p>"Any settlement that you may propose, through your lawyer, shall receive immediate
                  attention," he said.</p>
               <p>I bowed coldly.</p>
               <p>This, then, was the thought that occupied him. He could think of money matters
                  when I was suffering agonies at parting from him.</p>
               <p>I would have died rather than receive one penny from him.</p>
               <p>Just then the carriage came to the door.</p>
               <p>The driver took my trunk, and I followed him; my husband was behind me, though I
                  did not know it.</p>
               <p>He lifted me kindly into the carriage, and said a few friendly good-by words.</p>
               <p>The driver cracked his whip, and we were parted for ever.</p>
               <p>I sank back in the coach, and wept bitterly.</p>
               <p>I knew that my husband supposed me to be going to my aunt's, but I had no such
                  idea.</p>
               <p>I would go somewhere, I cared not where, so nobody knew me, and there I would earn
                  my living.</p>
               <p>In the cars I matured my plans. I would go to Boston—from thence, to some place as
                  music teacher.</p>
               <pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7187-00000123"/>
               <p>I went to the Revere House, where I made the acquaintance of a Southern lady, a
                  teacher in a seminary at the South, and, under an assumed name, engaged to
                  accompany her as a teacher.</p>
               <p>I went with her, and never was there a sadder heart than mine during the nine
                  months that I spent there.</p>
               <p>I had ample leisure to view my conduct in its true light, and I saw much to
                  condemn. But what should I do? Must I live on so for ever? I asked myself. I
                  cannot; my whole soul would cry out; but I made no definite plans.</p>
               <p>Taking up a newspaper, one day, I saw a paragraph which spoke of the severe
                  illness of Dr. Carter.</p>
               <p>"He may die," I gasped, "and never forgive me."</p>
               <p>The thought was agony. All false pride was forgotten.</p>
               <p>I started immediately for home, travelling day and night, pursued by the harrowing
                  thought that he might die before I reached him.</p>
               <p>I inquired, as if I were a common acquaintance, at Binghamton, if he were
                  living.</p>
               <p>Thank God! he was.</p>
               <p>It was night, but I hurried up to that well-known house, on foot and alone.</p>
               <p>I <emph>ran</emph> through the streets. I entered the house, and walked softly up
                  to his chamber.</p>
               <p>There he lay, sleeping; his mother by his bedside, where his wife
                     <emph>should</emph> have been.</p>
               <p>Her head was bent forward, and she did not see me as I glided to his side.</p>
               <p>He tossed uneasily. "Sibyl!" he murmured in his sleep.</p>
               <p>"I am here," I whispered in his ear, for I could bear it no longer.</p>
               <p>He opened his eyes, fixed them on me with a look of love, sprang forward, and fell
                  back fainting.</p>
               <p>"Woman! you have killed him!" shrieked his mother.</p>
               <p>But it was not so. The shock had indeed been a great one, but he soon regained his
                  consciousness.</p>
               <p>There was no need of words then; all was forgotten. He could not bear to have me
                  leave his side, and I was happy nowhere else.</p>
               <p>I had become very humble, for I bowed myself to my mother-in-law. Was she not
                     <emph>his</emph> mother?</p>
               <p>My husband slowly recovered, and when I would have spoken of the past, and begged
                  his forgiveness, he replied—</p>
               <p>"Forgive me, too, Sibyl, for my severity. We have both suffered much, but we have
                  loved much; and we have learned a great lesson—that of mutual forbearance."</p>

               <p>MANY years ago, on the old stage-road leading from Boston to Plymouth, just out of
                  Wevmouth into Hingham, there lived an old woman who went by the name of Sue
                  Ward.</p>
               <p>Where she came from no one knew. Some years before the time of which we write, she
                  had taken up her abode in an old house which had been deserted by its former
                  owner, and there she dwelt—all alone, a perfect mystery to the gossips of the
                  neighborhood. She managed to get a living by doing all sorts of odd jobs for the
                  people of the village; by knitting now and then a pair of stockings; by spinning a
                  few knots of yarn, or going out as nurse for the sick. The villagers also, at
                  first, were quite kind to her. But after a while they began to weary of being
                  benevolent to so mysterious a being. All plotting and questioning to ascertain her
                  former life failed to produce any effect, save a stubborn refusal to gratify
                  curiosity riosity, and slight flashes of anger, which all inquirers agreed boded
                  no good.</p>
               <p>Although the time of which we write was after the excitement concerning the Salem
                  witches, yet belief in such beings had not wholly died away, especially among the
                  older portion of the community. Could they not quote the Bible and the godly Mr.
                  Mather in support of their doctrine?</p>
               <p>By-and-by strange stories began to be circulated concerning old Sue Ward. It was
                  said, that being vexed by Deacon Burr, she gave utterance to a muttered curse, and
                  the next morning the deacon's best heifer was found dead, in such a strange
                  position, that nobody but the devil could have brought her there. Then, as
                  Mistress Ward was walking home one cold night, Uncle Joshua overtook her in his
                  nice new wagon. She asked him to carry her home, as she was tired. But he replied
                  he could not, as it was rather off his road, and he was in a hurry. "May you be
                  longer reaching home than I am," exclaimed she, and but a moment afterwards his
                  horse fell, broke both shafts to the wagon, and what was worse, his own leg.</p>
               <p>These stories, somewhat magnified, perhaps, in the telling, were soon in the mouth
                  of every one in the village. Soon they spoke of her no longer as Mistress Ward, or
                  old Sue Ward. She possessed the three great requisites for a witch of that
                  time:</p>
               <p>I. She was old.</p>
               <p>II. She was ugly.</p>
               <p>III. She was poor.</p>
               <p>With such an evil suspicion hanging about her, it is no wonder that many who had
                  formerly befriended, now avoided her. Even the little children, having heard the
                  mysterious talk of their parents, as they passed her in the streets, clasped one
                  another's hands more tightly, and, gazing at<pb n="248-249"
                     xml:id="VAC7187-00000125"/> her with half-frightened looks, went hurriedly on,
                  though some of the larger boys would sometimes shout after her.</p>
               <p>Matters were thus, as one wild windy November night, old Sue sat by her fire in
                  her lonely hut. She had been out to gather the fagots of which the fire was built,
                  and meeting some rude boys on her return, they had taunted her with unseemly
                  words. Not often would such words have affected her so much. But as the screaming
                  wind howled through the branches of the forest, and she heard the moanings of the
                  dying autumn, thinking all the while that she knew not where to look for help
                  through the coming winter, what wonder that she felt like cursing the day in which
                  she was born?</p>
               <p>She did curse it most bitterly. Her wicked, withered old heart was lifting itself
                  up in blasphemy, as she sat by her fire that night, and gazed intently into its
                  flames as they lighted up her miserable room.</p>
               <p>"Why can't I die?" muttered she to herself. "As if seventy years of sorrow,
                  seventy years of sin, wasn't enough for one mortal! Doesn't the Bible say that
                  threescore years and ten are the limits of life? Why should I live longer? I,
                  without friends, with none of the comforts which belong to age—old, poor,
                  miserable, half-starved, and cold?" and she drew up closer to the fire, and
                  continued:</p>
               <p>"I would drown myself, but the water is so cold. I have not strength enough to
                  kill myself any other way. Why is there no other way but dying to be rid of the
                  world? If folks could cast off life as they do an old garment! I've heard of old
                  worsen that dried up and blew away. The Lord knows I'm dry enough. Why, if He will
                  not let me die, will He not blow me away? I should not care if it was to a warmer
                  place than this, where old women don't have to go out after fagots." And she
                  grinned a most wicked grin, showing one worn yellow stump of a tooth.</p>
               <p>"Good-evening, Mother Ward," said a voice at her elbow.</p>
               <p>She turned, and saw just at her side a little old man dressed in black. A quick
                  active old fellow he seemed, as, without being asked, he drew the other of the two
                  rush-bottomed chairs—all the seats the room contained—up to the fire.</p>
               <p>"Who are you? What do you want?" asked old Sue, as soon as she had a little
                  recovered from her astonishment at this sudden interruption.</p>
               <p>"A poor cold traveller who wishes to warm himself at your fire," replied he, just
                  glancing at her with his keen black eye. Oh, it was the wickedest eye you ever
                  saw, so full of malice and deviltry, so glittering, and snake-like.</p>
               <p>"You are welcome to the little warmth a wretched old woman's fire can give. But
                  you have not told me your name, though I ought to know it, as you seem to know
                  mine."</p>
               <p>"I go under different names," replied he; "those most familiar with me, call me by
                  a nickname, but my proper title is Beel Z. Bubb. But why do you call yourself
                  wretched?"</p>
               <p>"Have you not lived long enough in the world to know?" replied she, almost
                  fiercely. "There are gray hairs on your brow, and the wrinkles on your face will
                  number almost as many as mine. Is it not always wretched to be old? But perhaps
                  you have warm friends who cheer you with their presence, and sustain you by their
                  love?"</p>
               <p>She paused a moment, as if waiting for a reply. But the old man sat with his
                  elbows resting on his knees, looking stedfastly into the fire with his cunning
                  eyes. The old woman continued—</p>
               <pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7187-00000126"/>
               <p>"Perhaps you do not know what it is to outlive all the friends of your youth, to
                  wander away among strangers, and to be shunned and despised by them, to be treated
                  and hooted at as a witch, as one who has dealings with the devil, when I know no
                  more of the devil than you do."</p>
               <p>"Not perhaps as much," said he, in an undertone. She went on not hearing or not
                  heeding him.</p>
               <p>"You may not have felt all the wickedness of your soul rise up against your
                  persecutors, prompting you to curse them as I have cursed them time and again, and
                  curse them now. Oh, the good Christian souls! who pretend to be so pious and holy,
                  who roll up their eyes at the very sight of me! I should not wonder if some of
                  them had more dealings with Satan than myself."</p>
               <p>"No doubt of it," rejoined the old man.</p>
               <p>Old Sue went on, feeling a strange, thrilling pleasure in telling her wicked
                  thoughts to the one at her side, whose eyes gleamed brighter, and looked more
                  evil, the more wicked she grew.</p>
               <p>"And I was thinking what a mockery it would be for me to say the Lord's Prayer.
                  'Our Father'——"</p>
               <p>The old man gave an uneasy start as she said these words, yet remained quiet, as
                  she repeated no more; but, smiting her skinny hands together, exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"Why should I call Him <emph>my</emph> Father? Has He treated me as a child? Has
                  He not left me here in my old age, to rags, and poverty, and abuse, when He might
                  have taken me to His blessed home beyond the skies long before this? Death would
                  long ago have been welcome to me."</p>
               <p>"Why do you not kill yourself, then?" asked the old man, softly.</p>
               <p>"I was thinking of that just as you came in. But it is an ugly, horrible business
                  to take one's own life. If there were only some easier way to rid one's self of
                  the world! Did you ever hear," continued she, speaking in a low confidential tone;
                  "did ever you hear of any old women that dried up and blew away?"</p>
               <p>The Cunning-eyed One for a while spoke not a word. He sat there still and quiet,
                  looking fixedly into the fire. But all at once he burst out with a wild stave of a
                  song. The words so wrought upon the imagination of Mother Ward, that—she knew not
                  why—she began to stamp her feet in accompaniment, and when he came to the chorus,
                  she joined her shrill treble to his cracked bass, and the strange melody rang out
                  clear and piercingly: <q>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"Chorus again!" shouted the old man, stamping his<pb n="252-253"
                     xml:id="VAC7187-00000127"/> foot. And they sang it through again, till the old
                  walls of the room echoed with the wild scream of their voices.</p>
               <p>"Those good old times may come again," said the old man, after they had finished
                  the singing. "But there is a certain state of feeling to which every one must
                  arrive, before they can vanish from earth. People in the old times oftener reached
                  it than at present."</p>
               <p>"What is that state? I will attain unto it," said Mother Ward.</p>
               <p>"I think you will; perhaps you have. Know, then, good mother, that all things here
                  on the earth are vanity. What is lighter than vanity? Doth not the slightest
                  breath stir the leaf of the willow? But vanity is lighter than even the willow's
                  leaf. I said all things were vanity; all things but love are so. It is that which
                  binds men to earth. Were it not for the love which human beings bear to one
                  another—puff—and away they would go, mine for ever. Now, Mother Ward, tell me,
                  have you rid yourself altogether of love? I find many who declare they have done
                  thus, and when I wonder they do not blow away, lo! down deep in their heart,
                  covered over it may be with the glitter of Mammon, with the dross of selfishness,
                  one little particle of love, which keeps them from being altogether vanity. But I
                  am preaching! Tell me, I say, have you rid yourself altogether of love?"</p>
               <p>Old Sue sat still and thought. Her mind went back through the path of weary years,
                  to the days when a happy child she had clung with affection to those who cherished
                  her under their roof, who called her their darling; she traced her own life as she
                  grew up a wayward beauty; her love poured out in its wealth and tenderness upon
                  one her parents deemed unworthy; her rebellion and forsaking of all for love of
                  him who was to be father and mother to her; her few short months of happiness, and
                  a terrible awakening as the earth received to its bosom her love, her only joy,
                  save an infant life which only kept her grief from laying herself by his side in
                  the grave.</p>
               <p>Old Sue buried her face in her hands, and wept as the memory of these times came
                  so vividly upon her. The Evil-eyed looked gloomily.</p>
               <p>But memory would not stop here—as his death and as her treasure's birth. It told
                  over her wrongs. The consciousness of finding herself without money, and
                  consequently without friends, in a great city; the long days of travel, with the
                  precious little one in her arms, to the home of her childhood; the winter's night
                  that heard her timorous knock at the door, and—</p>
               <p>The one at her side looked smilingly. The tears had dried, and foulest hate
                  scowled forth from her face.</p>
               <p>And the same wild night heard a father's curse upon his offspring; it saw a woman
                  faint and foot-worn go forth; with its winds and storms it hushed a child's cry
                  for ever, and wrought long months of disease upon the mother. From that bed of
                  sickness, Memory told her how she rose with vows of vengeance, but it did not dare
                  to dwell upon the unnatural crimes which followed; of vain endeavors to escape
                  remorse, of her flight over the sea, of the years she had wished to die.</p>
               <p>She rose from her seat—trembling and pale—for she had dared to think upon her
                  sinful past. She had a parent's love, and it had cursed instead of blessed her;
                  she won a dearer love, and it died from her; a child's love had blossomed in her
                  heart, but it was rudely killed and its death terribly avenged. She had no other
                  love—all was unfriendliness and hate.</p>
               <p>"Are you ready to go?" said the old man calmly. He knew that she was his.</p>
               <pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7187-00000128"/>
               <p>"Let me first warm myself before my journey," replied she. Then she gathered all
                  the fagots into the middle of the room, and kindled them. The room blazed in a
                  moment, as the flames leaped fierce and hot.</p>
               <p>"I am ready," said she.</p>
               <p>That night good John Benton came riding from Plymouth. As he approached old Sue's
                  hut he saw the fire burst forth from its windows, and strangest of all, two
                  shadowy forms glided far away above the burning flames, flying into the darkness
                  of the night, while a gust of wind mightier than ever he had before felt, almost
                  blew him from his horse.</p>
               <p>These things he averred to the crowd who collected around the burning dwelling.
                  And what confirmed the narration was, that no bones could be found among the
                  ruins—neither was old Sue Ward seen any more.</p>
               <p>This is a story believed by many persons to the present day, and on account of
                  which, every old house thereabouts has a horseshoe nailed to its door, and this
                  maxim prevails: <q>
                     <p>CHERISH LOVE LEST YOU BECOME VANITY.</p>

               <p>OUR country bids fair to be known as the Limbo of lost notables. Dethroned
                  monarchs and jail-breakers, usurpers and pickpockets, conspirators against
                  dynasties, and fugitives with their friends' wives, outlawed patriots and
                  fraudulent bankrupts, disappear from Europe to find their way here by the over-sea
                  railroad; and the most famous among them sink, after a few days of newspaper
                  notoriety and gossip, to the same forgetfulness as the meanest. The home-keeping
                  American, if he patiently bide his time, may hope to see the actors on the foreign
                  stage, political as well as dramatic, with greater probability than Barnum would
                  promise a succession of shows. The Connecticut Yankee will point you out the cave
                  where the regicide Puritan hid himself from the avenger of blood; the New-Yorker,
                  as the locomotive of the Hudson River Railroad is gaining its topmost speed, after
                  leaving the depôt at Thirty-first street, sees on a low rocky point the tan vats,
                  where (some say) Talleyrand curried hides, as more recently Garibald made candles
                  in Staten Island; on the curving shore of the Delaware lies the princely domain
                  which a Bonaparte enriched with the spoils of Spain, and a few miles above, on the
                  opposite bank, stand the stables of the country house from which Moreau went back
                  to die on the field in arms against his master and France. Many of us remember<pb
                     n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7187-00000129"/> ber Louis Philippe as a "schoolmaster
                  abroad" among us, rejected by a Philadelphia lady, and looking as like as two
                  pears to Dr. Hare; Louis Napoleon, his now Imperial supplanter, whose boots the
                  representatives of the oldest names of France are eager to lick, was voted by the
                  few who knew him, a worthless, dirty, debauched vagabond; one Murat put up his
                  shingle as an attorney-at-law in Florida, while his fat brother fought cocks among
                  blackguards at Bordentown. The Hungarian demagogue, half-orator, half-prophet,
                  whose oriental eloquence shook the continent like an earthquake, after showing,
                  like his types of Greece and Rome, a little white feather, strolls and stars it
                  among our staring democrats for a dollar a head and expenses; nor may the time be
                  far distant, when Pio Nono, again abandoning the City of Martyrs, will sing: <q>
                     <l>"I've been Rome-ing, I've been roaming,"</l>
                  </q> within the classic cloisters of Fordham; and now reigning sovereigns and
                  haughty aristocrats find a safe hedge in our banks and state-funds, should the
                  cards be dealt against them at home. Odd, isn't it? that the "insecure and
                  ephemeral republic, which has in its bosom the elements of its own destruction,"
                  should be used as the ultimate asylum of life and fortune, when the arsenals and
                  treasure-houses, gray with the moss of centuries, crumble before revolutionary
                  fires! and that those who can stir so furiously the cauldrons of popular passion,
                  despite of the police and bayonets of strong governments, fail to make on this
                  side of the Atlantic any more fuss than a nine days' wonder! <q>

                  lionized as much as Morpeth, and Mr. G. P. R. (are there any more initials?)
                  James, the Man voluminous, out-tales among us the most Bashaw magnificent of them
                  all. We even meet them on their own ground. Jim Crow and his wife oust Punch and
                  Judy from the puppet-show-box, where their "flag has waved a thousand years;"
                  while Uncle Tom and Topsey carry off the admiration of a Parisian carnival, from
                  "the nephew of my uncle" and his imperial Eugenie. Nay, should the privileged
                  blood run out over there, it will go hard but we can supply them. A few years
                  since (according to certain genealogists), a legitimate Stuart domiciled on Long

                  his visit to Europe, find a queen or heiress-apparent anxious for progeny, he may
                  negotiate a marriage on behalf of Prince John, than whom she cannot find a more
                  vigorous or better husband among her royal cousins. We cannot spare him, however,
                  until he has smashed the aldermen, after which he will be up to any amount of
                  emancipation and reform.</p>
               <p>—But I beg pardon. I sat down to write a story, and have been wandering in a fit
                  of patriotic ardor. I meant to say, in the beginning, that many a man, who might
                  have been notable elsewhere from facts in his career, is<pb n="258-259"
                     xml:id="VAC7187-00000130"/> allowed here to remain in obscurity, of which I was
                  going to give an example.</p>
               <p>The English, stimulated by their zeal for illuminating the heathen and removing
                  oppression, are now pushing a disinterested crusade over the Burman empire; but is
                  it known to you, patient reader of Putnam, that so far back as the first French
                  Republic, an ambassador from that great nation, and he an American, was received
                  with high honors at the Court of Ava? Nevertheless, so it was; and that is the
                  story I have to tell—a true story—not a romance, but a veracious narrative of what
                  actually occurred. I give it as I had it from the lips of a friend, who heard the
                  hero of the adventure relate it himself.</p>
               <p>—There lived in a neighboring city a most worthy man, who by a long and honorable
                  prosecution of an extensive trade, had won both large fortune and high reputation.
                  Sometimes, by artful persuasion, he could be induced to give, though reluctantly,
                  an account of a singular passage in his early life. The recital would set the
                  table in a roar, which was no way checked by the grave vexation which he showed
                  over his remembered troubles. Others might laugh at them, but they had no fun for
                  him.</p>
               <p>—When I was quite young, he would say, I was placed with the well-known firm of ——
                  &amp; Co., and at the age of eighteen had gained their confidence so far, as often
                  to be intrusted with important business, which fired my ambition to the highest
                  pitch. About that time the firm resolved to send one of their best ships with a
                  large cargo of <emph>piece goods</emph> on a long trading voyage to the East, and
                  to my extreme gratification, I was appointed supercargo to act in concert with the
                  captain in the management of the venture. The captain was a most kind and
                  intelligent man, whose society was of great use to me. Our voyage out was speedy,
                  and our operations for some time very successful. I often congratulated myself on
                  my share of the profits, but more on the credit I should have with my principals
                  for discharging so well the duties they had assigned me. This was my constant
                  theme when conversing with the captain, scarcely less delighted than myself. Not
                  all the strange wonders of the eastern world, the magnificent scenery along the
                  shores of continent and island, the voluptuous fragrance of "the spicy breezes,"
                  or the clear grandeur of the sparkling heavens, could seduce me from considering,
                  night and day, how I should sell the piece goods, and buy a return cargo to the
                  best advantage. Every evening the invoices, with my well-worn letter of
                  instructions, were spread out on my cabin table, and I went to my berth to dream
                  of balance-sheets and future copartnerships.</p>
               <p>—But a sad disaster came over our hopes. One of those frequent storms which are
                  experienced only in those latitudes, suddenly fell upon us. For many hours we
                  drifted on in utter darkness, except when the lightning kindled the foaming waves
                  to flames. Everything that human skill and daring could do was done by our noble
                  captain and his hardy crew; but the elements were too much for us. Spar after spar
                  was shivered, the tiller-ropes parted and the rudder unshipped. When thus crippled
                  and at the mercy of winds and waves, a terrible cry came aft of "Breakers ahead!"
                  and before a word could be spoken, the ship was lifted high on a rolling sea, and
                  flung bodily on an outlying reef. The shock threw some overboard, and for a few
                  moments stupefied the rest. Death stared us fiercely in the face. I was little
                  more than a boy, and life was dear to me. I thought of home and those I loved. I
                  tried to think of eternity; but amidst all I could not help thinking of the piece
                  goods—what would become of them when the vessel broke up? would<pb n="260-261"
                     xml:id="VAC7187-00000131"/> they sink among the astonished fishes, or be
                  strewed along the shores to be picked up by the natives? What would our House at
                  home think of us? Would they ever find out how well we had managed, and how much
                  we had made for them before the wreck? All these and a thousand more such thoughts
                  passed through my mind with incredible quickness; and notwithstanding most
                  vigorous efforts to turn it on religious things, the piece goods would struggle to
                  be uppermost. I have heard that Napoleon's last words were, "Tête d'armée!" mine,
                  had I perished then, would have been, "Piece goods!"</p>
               <p>But we were saved. When at our utmost extremity, there came a calm as sudden as
                  the storm. The breakers were still dashing over us, but as the morning sun broke
                  through the clouds, they subsided rapidly, and we were able to judge of our
                  situation. The ship was clearly lost to us, though her hull, perched upon rocks
                  bare at low water, was as yet but little broken, and I saw that the piece goods
                  were for the most part undamaged. Some boats from the coast came off to us, and we
                  managed to learn that we were a few leagues from the town of Rangoon, at the
                  principal mouth of the river Irrawaddy.</p>
               <p>To our still greater satisfaction, two English trading brigs, on hearing of a
                  vessel being cast away, ran down to us, and as they were nearly empty, we were
                  able to transfer a large, and the best part of the cargo (which, being piece
                  goods, could be more easily handled), from our stranded vessel into theirs. More
                  intent upon saving the piece goods, we had taken nothing from the cabin but the
                  ship's papers and the captain's instruments, before a change in the tide filled it
                  with water, leaving us only the clothes we stood in. The chief men of the town
                  permitted us to land and store our piece goods, and we intended, if possible, to
                  purchase some vessel in which to prosecute our voyage. The captains of the English
                  brigs, and some other English who happened to be there, treated us with great
                  kindness, but none more so than a Colonel Symes, who sent us all the clothing we
                  stood in need of from his own wardrobe, besides many other attentions. This
                  Colonel Symes was an eminently sensible gentleman, who had been sent there by the
                  British East India Company to negotiate preliminaries for a commercial treaty with
                  the king of the country; but he told us that although he had been several weeks
                  waiting for it, he had not yet received permission to go up the river to Ava, were
                  the court was held. Although treated in every other respect with great
                  distinction, and hospitable provision for his comforts, he was quite chafed by the
                  delay; yet the importance of his mission compelled him to endure as a diplomat
                  what he fretted at as a soldier. He was fond of talking his troubles over with me,
                  mainly, I suppose, because the modesty of my youth made me a deferential listener.
                  You will judge from this how much we owed to our English friends, and how loath we
                  would have been willingly to be of any hindrance to them, Colonel Symes
                  particularly.</p>
               <p>Things went on in this way for several weeks, the captain and myself lodging
                  together, and listlessly waiting for some vessel to come in, which we might
                  purchase or charter; when one morning, as we were over our breakfast, we heard a
                  great noise of music, or what the people there mean for music—blowing of horns,
                  beating of tomtoms and gongs, and other horrid things. It came nearer and nearer,
                  and halted before the door of our humble house. On going to the window we saw, to
                  our astonishment, the street for a considerable distance crowded with military,
                  horse and foot. A superbly dressed officer, whom they seemed to be escorting,
                  dismounted amidst<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7187-00000132"/> another grand
                  flourish of the music, and, leaving his richly caparisoned horse in the care of a
                  servant, bowed his head under the low portal, and entered the house. That he came
                  to visit us we had not the slightest idea, until he flung open the door and <hi
                     rend="i"/>salaamed us to the ground. Even so respectful a gesture failed to
                  allay the alarm the captain and I felt for our lives, and the piece goods, which
                  were stowed in the rear of the dwelling; but, while we were alternately exchanging
                  looks with each other and staring at our remarkable visitor, a meek-looking native
                  stole to his side and made signs that he would act as interpreter, which he
                  afterwards did in very broken English.</p>
               <p>"My lord," said he, "who is a very great man and brave general, has been sent by
                  the most mighty king, at whose power we tremble, and in whose smile we live, to
                  assure your Excellencies of the great satisfaction he has had in hearing of your
                  safe arrival in his dominions."</p>
               <p>The captain answered, "Tell the gentleman that we cannot understand why he or the
                  king should be so civil to us, as my friend here is nothing more than a
                  supercargo, and I only captain of a ship, with a cargo of piece goods. Our vessel
                  was wrecked a little way from here, and we are only waiting to get another, and be
                  off, without troubling the king or anybody else."</p>
               <p>The interpreter appeared to translate it; the officer spoke to him again, and he
                  said to us:</p>
               <p>"My lord, in the name of his Majesty our most mighty king, desires to say that he
                  has heard of the vast and glorious republic of France, and prays that its
                  prosperity may be increased for ever; he also hopes that the serene and
                  magnificent King of the Republic of France is in perfect health, and victorious
                  over all his enemies."</p>
               <p>"The Republic of France! The King of the Republic of France! What do you mean, Mr.
                  Interpreter? We know nothing about France; neither of us were ever there in our
                  lives. We're Yankees, not Frenchmen, thank God! However, you must be a little
                  green, Mister, to talk about kings of a republic. Our country is a republic, free
                  and independent, and we have none of your kings there, I guess. But tell the
                  gentleman he is mistaken in thinking we are Frenchmen; though if he or his Majesty
                  want to buy any piece goods, we are ready for a dicker."</p>
               <p>The Captain had taken a fresh quid, shut his jack-knife with a valorous slap, and
                  was as much of a live Yankee as five-feet-eight in height and four feet round the
                  chest could make him.</p>
               <p>After another interchange of their gibberish, the little man said again:</p>
               <p>"My lord begs that he may be informed which of you most excellent gentlemen is his
                  great Excellency the Ambassador of the vast and glorious Republic of France, that
                  he may give him especially the salutation of his sublime Majesty, our most mighty
                  king."</p>
               <p>"Tell him, I tell you, you blundering lubber, that we ain't neither of us
                  Frenchmen, nor ambassadors, either. We don't represent nothing but our owners, and
                  a cargo of piece goods. Why don't you tell the gentleman so, and be done with your
                  humbugging!"</p>
               <p>"My lord begs to say to your Excellencies, that he cannot be mistaken; one of you
                  must be the ambassador of the vast and glorious Republic of France, and he
                  entreats your amiable Excellencies to tell him which of you it is."</p>
               <p>"I tell you again, neither of us. We can't speak a word of parleyvoo, and don't
                  want to. We're a couple of Yankees from the States."</p>
               <p>"My lord says, your honorable Excellencies, that he has had his orders from our
                  mighty king to come here and<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7187-00000133"/> find his
                  eminence the ambassador from the vast and glorious Republic of France, and escort
                  him up the river to Ava, that he may communicate with his ever-to-be-worshipped
                  majesty the wishes of his government. A thousand troops are waiting to guard him
                  to the river, where the boats are ready. My lord does not care which of you is the
                  ambassador; that you may settle between yourselves; but one of you must go with
                  him as the high and noble-born ambassador of the vast and glorious Republic of
                  France."</p>
               <p>Finding the thing becoming serious and our military visitor determined to execute
                  his orders, right or wrong, we proposed to send for Colonel Symes, that he might
                  explain the mistake; but this the General would not hear of, declaring that one of
                  us must set off with him at once. Further resistance was impossible, and the
                  Captain and I consulted which should go. Whether the one who went would ever
                  return, or if he did, how long he would be kept, we could not tell. I could sell
                  the piece goods, but could not sail a ship if one were got; the Captain could do
                  both without me; so we decided that, as it would not be right to abandon the piece
                  goods, I should give myself up to our captor, for he acted like one. I then told
                  him again that it was all a mistake, as he would find out when we reached Ava; but
                  if he insisted upon taking one of us, I was his man. Whereupon he salaamed me to
                  the ground, and begged to set out with me at once. The Captain and I had a brief
                  conference about the piece goods, which I reluctantly gave over to his single
                  control. I shook his hands with tears in my eyes, for I was but a boy and feared
                  that I should never see him or home again, and stood ready to go. The General
                  called in servants with rich dresses, and preventing me from putting up any of the
                  clothes I had borrowed of Colonel Symes, enveloped me in several sumptuous cloaks
                  and shawls, putting a sort of cap on my head, and preceded me down-stairs, with
                  many tokens of respect. On reaching the door, the band made a grand crash of
                  horns, and cymbals, and drums, to salute me; a splendidly caparisoned horse was
                  led up, which I was told to mount; and surrounded by the troops, we went in
                  triumph through the town. As we passed Colonel Symes' quarters, I saw him looking
                  out of his door with great astonishment, and tried to speak to him, but the guard
                  closed up around me, and I could only wave a sad farewell as we passed on.</p>
               <p>Reaching the river side, I found the array on the water even more imposing than
                  that on the land. There could not have been less than fifty boats, each of them
                  forty feet long, broad and shallow, and filled with oarsmen. First, in one went
                  the General and his officers; then in another the horrible band; then I followed,
                  the only passenger, in the most highly decorated of them all; then another boat,
                  with my cooks and their apparatus; then boats laden deep with provisions, boats
                  with my wardrobe, from which several times a day changes of dress were brought me;
                  and, as far as I could see, boats filled with soldiers and attendants. Every night
                  (and we were several days on the voyage) we went ashore, and they built me a
                  house, which was pulled down the next morning, according to their custom, which
                  does not allow an inferior person to live in a house which had once been occupied
                  by one of my supposed rank. Every luxury they could procure was spread on my
                  table. I had no reason to complain of my living, though the dishes were strange to
                  me, and I had to eat them without knife or fork. There was no end to the distant
                  honors they paid me; but I was very lonely, with none to talk to, and no one to
                  understand a word I said when any one came near enough. My thoughts were<pb
                     n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7187-00000134"/> very sad, and my apprehensions of
                  danger constant. I felt like a gaily dressed beast going to a slaughter-house; and
                  not a little of my trouble rose from anxiety about the piece goods.</p>
               <p>In this way we pulled up the river until we arrived at the city, where thousands
                  of troops, with yet more dissonant and louder music, awaited my landing. A
                  splendid horse was brought for me, which, after putting on the finest of the
                  dresses, making me look more like a woman than a man, I mounted. The whole
                  population were in the streets gazing on the splendid procession, which conducted
                  me to a house as grand as a palace in the middle of the town. There scores of
                  servants anticipated all my wants, and a bed like one of our own, only more
                  showily decorated, awaited my repose. That night, overcome by fatigue of mind and
                  body, I slept soundly, forgetting my utter loneliness among thousands who were as
                  ignorant of my language as I was of theirs.</p>
               <p>The next morning, after my solitary breakfast, an officer of the court presented
                  himself, with an interpreter, bearing a message of welcome from the King to his
                  Excellency the Ambassador from the vast and glorious Republic of France. I lost no
                  time in assuring the officer, through the interpreter, that there must have been
                  an unaccountable blunder in taking me for an ambassador from France, as I was not
                  even a Frenchman, and begging him to tell the king so, that I might go back to the
                  cargo of piece goods which had been intrusted to my care. The only answer I got
                  was that the King hoped the most honorable Ambassador would find himself satisfied
                  with the arrangements made for his comfort during his stay in the city. Another
                  weary day, and another, and another, when the officer again came to say that the
                  King hoped in a short time to have a conference with the Ambassador respecting a
                  commercial mercial treaty, which His Majesty was glad to hear the Republic of
                  France wished to make with him. More earnestly than ever I entreated the
                  interpreter, who spoke English quite well, to let the King know how much I was
                  embarrassed by the mistaken notion that I was anything else than a supercargo of a
                  large venture in piece goods, and that the interests of my principals might suffer
                  severely from my involuntary absence. A low salaam as the officer left me was his
                  only reply. Every morning the same was repeated, I becoming each time more urgent
                  for an interview, that the vexatious blunder might be put an end to, but in vain.
                  My quarters were good, my table well supplied with their curious dishes and a
                  profusion of French wines. If I intimated a wish to go out, my horse came
                  immediately to the door; but I could go nowhere without a close guard of cavalry
                  about me. On one of those excursions I saw my friend Colonel Symes in a sort of
                  balcony, who recognized me, changed as my appearance was, yet could not get near
                  enough to speak to him, for my escort hurried on, with loud shouts of "Honor to
                  the illustrious Ambassador of the vast and glorious Republic of France!" the
                  language of which, by this time, I had learned only too well.</p>
               <p>Three months and more passed on in this way, when at last the officer announced
                  that His Majesty had been pleased to appoint the next day for the appearance at
                  court of the Ambassador of the Republic of France. Now, thought I, my troubles
                  will be at an end, for the King will certainly see that a smooth-chinned lad of
                  nineteen, who cannot speak any language but English, could never be the Ambassador
                  of the French Republic.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, at the hour, robed in the ceremonial garments they brought me, I set
                  out with ten times my ordinary escort to the palace, which was near the city gate,
                     the<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7187-00000135"/> procession taking a wide détour
                  through the principal streets, while the soldiers and populace redoubled their
                  acclamations in honor of the Ambassador from the Republic of France. On entering
                  the palace, I was ushered into a large hall, filled with a multitude of people
                  squatting on their legs, their heads bowed to the ground in the direction of an
                  opening at the upper end, screened by a curtain. The attendants led me to the
                  front, and then with courteous but irresistible strength, forced me down to the
                  true posture of the rest. After waiting some little time, the curtain was drawn
                  aside, and the King, enthroned on a sort of wagon, was wheeled into the apartment.
                  The multitude beat their heads on the floor in silence, when he beckoned me to
                  draw near him.</p>
               <p>"I have the high felicity," said he, by an interpreter, "of seeing the Ambassador
                  of the Republic of France at my court."</p>
               <p>"Your Majesty is very much mistaken," I replied; "I am not a French ambassador,
                  but a young American, sent out by —— &amp; Co., of ——, as supercargo of a vessel
                  laden with piece goods, which was unfortunately wrecked near the mouth of the
                  river, and I entreat your Majesty to let me go back to my duties."</p>
               <p>"I have unmeasured satisfaction in hearing from you, most distinguished sir," the
                  King answered, "the pleasing assurances of friendship and good-will from so vast
                  and glorious a republic as that of France."</p>
               <p>"I brought no such message, please your Majesty, and never told the interpreter
                  anything of the kind. He deceives you, and will not tell you what I say."</p>
               <p>"I know now," the King rejoined, "what the wishes of the Republic of France are,
                  and will give my prime minister orders to draw up a treaty on that basis, which
                  to-morrow will be submitted for your Excellency's approval."</p>
               <p>"Please your Majesty, I have stated no such thing. I cannot negotiate with your
                  minister for France. I said that I was only a supercargo of a speculation in piece
                  goods, and it is the fault of the interpreters that your Majesty did not know this
                  long ago. I have been putting you to expense and wasting several months for
                  nothing, and I earnestly entreat your Majesty to let me go back to my captain and
                  the cargo."</p>
               <p>With a benign smile the King rose and addressed me:</p>
               <p>"I cannot express my satisfaction with your cordial assent to the proposed plan of
                  a treaty which we will now consider definitely fixed, awaiting only your signature
                  and that of my minister, when the instrument shall have been prepared, as it will
                  be to-morrow. I shall also cause your government to be made acquainted with the
                  profound regard I entertain for your skill in managing the negotiations. Wishing
                  you all personal happiness, I part from you with the hope that your diplomatic
                  career will be always as successful, though I must add that, never before (and
                  here an arch expression betrayed itself at the corner of his mouth) have I
                  transacted business with so young an ambassador."</p>
               <p>The audience was over, and under a grand escort I returned to my lodgings. That
                  night a half-dozen men carried me in a close palanquin to the river, put me in a
                  small boat, and without any other attendants pulled me night and day down the
                  river to the coast, where I found the Captain just ready to sail in a barque he
                  had loaded with our piece goods. After a few days we were off, and I had no desire
                  whatever to change again the Yankee supercargo for a French ambassador. Our
                  subsequent trading was not unprofitable, and though the wreck and delays
                  occasioned temporary losses, we made a good voyage for our owners. I retained some
                  relics of my involuntary grandeur<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7187-00000136"/> deur,
                  and among the rest a little ebony casket, on opening which I found a permit from
                  his Majesty of Ava to bring two cargoes of piece goods into his dominions duty
                  free; a privilege I availed myself of, sending, however, another supercargo, as I
                  had no notion of running the risk of being taken again for a Frenchman, or an
                  ambassador.</p>
               <p>You have looked and laughed incredulously, gentlemen, during my story; but the
                  secret of the mystery was simply this: Col. Symes<ref rend="super"
                     target="#note_001" xml:id="return_001">*</ref>
                   was eager to press upon Burmah a commercial treaty, which the king was
                  disinclined to for many reasons; yet fearing British anger, he temporized with the
                  cunning of a semi-barbarian, and to put off the Colonel, he passed me off, as he
                  thought, as an ambassador from France, excusing himself from an audience to Symes
                  on the ground that he was unwilling at once to break with the French, though
                  unwilling to grant them terms. Whether or not he succeeded in deceiving Col.
                  Symes, you can judge; but the ruse answered his purpose for the time. It did not,
                  however, console me to discover that I had been made an unconscious agent in
                  baffling so long my kind English friend, who subsequently, however, succeeeded in
                  making a treaty with the king.</p>
               <note place="foot" xml:id="note_001">
                  
                  <p><ref target="#return_001">*</ref>We do not remember positively that the officer alluded to was Col. Symes;
                     but the name resembled Symes; and as a Col. Symes did, about that time,
                     visit Ava on an embassy, we think it so probable that he was the man, as to
                     risk inserting the name.</p>

               <head>XIV. ELEGANT TOM DILLAR.</head>
               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
                  <p>To speak of Tom Dillar in any other way than by his pseudonyme of Elegant,
                     would be like speaking of Harold Harefoot, Edwin the Fair, the Black Prince, or
                     Louis the Debonair, without their distinguishing adjectives. Tom Dillar was
                     known to his acquaintances only as Elegant Tom, and he was well entitled to the
                     epithet, for he was elegant in looks, manners, and style. He was one of those
                     happy persons who seem to have come into the world for the sole purpose of
                     eating the sunny side of ripe peaches. There were no deficiencies in Elegant
                     Tom Dillar, and if one could have the ordering of his own antecedents, they
                     could not be superior to Tom's. On the side of his father, he was connected
                     with the best English families in the State; and, by the mother's side, he
                     could boast of the purest Dutch descent. He inherited a large fortune from his
                     father, and, what was much better, a healthy constitution and a handsome
                     person. Being independent in his circumstances, he was not educated for a
                     profession; but, being apt to learn, he was taught a good many accomplishments
                     that are not generally bestowed upon American youths. He could dance much
                     better than most professors of that elegant art; and in music he was something
                     more than a proficient upon the guitar, the piano, and the violin.<pb
                        n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7187-00000137"/> Then he had a fine voice—a delicious
                     tenor—and those who had the good fortune to hear him sing used to boast of it,
                     as though a piece of rare luck had befallen them. Tom was good-natured, too;
                     and as amiable as though it were necessary for him to conciliate the world,
                     that his presence might not be considered an intrusion. But, of all men, he was
                     least likely to be considered <foreign xml:lang="FRA">de trop</foreign> in the
                     world.</p>
                  <p>He went abroad, and came back as amiable and unpretending as he went, but with
                     more accomplishments than he carried away. He was invited everywhere, and he
                     might have married any girl he chose to honor in that manner; but, as often
                     happens in such cases, he seemed never to have been touched in his heart by any
                     of the beautiful creatures who surrounded him. There was Fanny Ormolu, the only
                     daughter of the great auctioneer, who, they used to say, was dying for him; and
                     it was said that her father was so fearful of the effects of Tom's indifference
                     on his daughter's health, that he was guilty of the indelicacy of offering to
                     settle a hundred thousand dollars on him if he would marry her. But Tom had
                     never known what it was to want money, and, like an honorable, high-minded
                     fellow as he was, refused to sell himself, even at so high a figure, and to so
                     beautiful a purchaser.</p>
                  <p>They say that old Ormolu was so exasperated and indignant at Tom's refusal,
                     that he swore he would have satisfaction for the insult; and he was as good as
                     his word. He did not challenge Tom, nor, indeed, permit him to know that he
                     entertained any ill-will against him; for, if he had, he probably would not
                     have been able to accomplish his purpose. Ormolu was a commercial gentleman,
                     and his manner of getting satisfaction was a purely business transaction: in
                     fact, the old fellow did not understand anything else. He set himself
                     deliberately to work to ruin Tom by getting away all his money. As this would
                     have been the severest punishment that could have been inflicted upon himself,
                     he naturally and very sensibly imagined that he could inflict no greater wrong
                     upon another than by making him a bankrupt.</p>
                  <p>Now, Tom was not a spendthrift, nor a gambler; but then he was the merest child
                     in business matters, and had no idea about money transactions beyond drawing
                     his dividends every six months, and contriving to make his income just meet his
                     expenditure. Tom had often wished that his income was larger, for he had long
                     been ambitious of owning a yacht, but was unable to indulge in that costly
                     enjoyment; so, when his young friend, Pete Van Slicer, of the firm of Van
                     Slicer, Son &amp; Co., the great stockbrokers, of Wall street, one day said to
                     him, as if by accident, "Tom, how would you like to enter into a little
                     speculation, by which you might make a hundred thousand dollars or so?" Tom
                     opened his eyes, and eagerly replied he would like nothing better.</p>
                  <p>Pete then carelessly remarked that Bob So-and-So had made nearly double that
                     sum a few days before, by a corner in Harlem, and that he could put Tom in the
                     way of making at least that amount by a speculation in Pottawattamy Coal Stock.
                     Tom, not being familiar with stock operations, asked how it could be done;
                     whereupon Pete explained to him that certain parties, having sold long in the
                     stock, were going to get up a corner, which would compel the shorts to buy in,
                     and that the stock would then begin to rise, and there was no knowing where it
                     would stop. What Pete proposed that Tom should do was, to buy in while it was
                     down, and when the rise should reach its height to sell out, and pocket the
                     profits.</p>
                  <p>"Can I rely on the rise taking place?" asked Tom, who had not a very clear
                     notion of the nature of the transaction.</p>
                  <pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7187-00000138"/>
                  <p>"Trust to me," replied Pete, with a knowing wink, which seemed to Tom so full
                     of sagacity, that he concluded to trust to him, and accordingly gave an order
                     to the firm of Van Slicer, Son &amp; Co. to purchase, for his account, about
                     ten times as many shares of the Pottawattamy Coal Stock as he had the means to
                     pay for, Pete undertaking to carry the stock, as he called it, for thirty days,
                     in which time the rise was sure to occur.</p>
                  <p>Having made this little business arrangement with his Wall street friend, Tom
                     jumped into one of the Dry Dock stages, to go up to the ship-yards and make
                     inquiries about the cost of a yacht; and that night he dreamed of winning the
                     Queen's cup at the Cowes regatta, and of lying at anchor in the harbor of
                     Newport, and other pleasant things connected with the manly sport of
                     yachting.</p>
                  <p>Tom did not know that his friend, Pete Van Slicer, was paying attention to
                     Fanny Ormolu; and, even if he had, he would never have imagined that old Ormolu
                     was making use of the young stockbroker to ruin his friend. But such was the
                     fact.</p>
                  <p>The next day the Elegant Tom Dillar created a good deal of surprise among the
                     motley throng of Jews and "lame ducks" that hover round the doors of the Stock
                     Board in the third story of the Merchants' Exchange; and when a playful Hebrew
                     knocked Tom's hat over his eyes, as he stood anxiously waiting to hear what
                     Pottawattamy sold at, he was so engrossed in his new speculation, that he never
                     thought of resenting the affront. Pottawattamy went up one per cent. that day,
                     but the next it went down ten, and the next ten more, and Tom received a brief
                     note from Van Slicer, Son &amp; Co., informing him that he was their debtor for
                     losses on Pottawattamy Coal Stock, in a sum that considerably exceeded his
                     entire fortune.</p>
                  <p>A man who has never felt the actual cautery of poverty, cannot have a very
                     clear idea of what that word really means, and Tom did not, therefore, feel
                     half so badly as he ought to have done, when he had to confess to himself that
                     he was a bankrupt.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing to be gained by going into the distressing particulars of
                     Tom's settlement with his brokers, and therefore I will merely remark, that on
                     the very day upon which all his available property passed out of his hands into
                     those of Van Slicer, Son &amp; Co., the junior member of that eminent firm was
                     united in the holy bonds of matrimony, as the papers say, to Fanny Ormolu, only
                     daughter, and so forth, of Jefferson Ormolu, Esq., our enterprising and
                     esteemed fellow-citizen, of the eminent firm of Ormolu, Bronze &amp; Co.</p>

               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                  <p>THE ruin of Thomas Dillar, Esq., was complete. Wall street never witnessed a
                     more decided cleaning out than in the case of my elegant friend. It was so
                     smoothly and rapidly done, that he was like the man who didn't know he was
                     decapitated until he attempted to nod his head—so sharply, so adroitly, and so
                     quickly, had the blow been dealt. But it does not take long for a person to
                     find out that he is poor, and Elegant Tom Dillar immediately began to have a
                     "realizing sense" of the true state of his case. He had nothing in the world
                     left but his watch, and a few articles of jewelry, by which he could raise
                     money enough to discharge the few debts he owed, and which were demanded with a
                     rude pertinacity that he had never known before. He had to abandon the hotel in
                     Broadway at which he had been living, and take cheap lodgings in Beekman
                     street; and, instead of having more invitations<pb n="276-277"
                        xml:id="VAC7187-00000139"/> to dine than he could accept, he suddenly found
                     himself without any invitation at all; as to evening parties, although he had
                     made up his mind not to go to any more, he had the mortification of being cut
                     by all his old friends, and soon ceased to expect any attentions from them.
                     Heretofore Tom had skimmed the cream of human existence; he had visited only in
                     the best circles, eaten the best dinners, drank the best wines, read the most
                     amusing books, worn the best clothes, and had known nothing of the infelicities
                     of human existence, except by hearsay. But now his turn had come to feed on
                     husks, and taste of hyssop.</p>
                  <p>What Tom had suffered, or how he had struggled, none knew but himself, for he
                     was too proud to complain, and, to all appearances, he was as light-hearted and
                     cheerful as ever he had been in his most prosperous days. But, as the writer of
                     these lines was one evening hurrying down Broadway, to escape from the clouds
                     of blinding dust which a cold, north-west wind was driving along that crowded
                     avenue, he was suddenly arrested, near the corner of Canal street, by a tap on
                     the shoulder. Turning round, he saw Elegant Tom Dillar, with his coat buttoned
                     closely up to his throat, and looking uncomfortably sharp, serious, and, to
                     make use of a vulgar figure of speech, seedy.</p>
                  <p>"How are you?" said Tom, in his usual elegant manner; but, without waiting for
                     a reply, he continued: "You needn't ask me how I am, for I can discern by your
                     looks that you see how I am. I am hungry."</p>
                  <p>Elegant Tom Dillar hungry!</p>
                  <p>I was too much shocked by this humiliating confession from a man whom I had
                     known and envied in his happier days, to disguise my feelings. But I put my
                     hand in my pocket to feel for my purse.</p>
                  <p>"Thank you," said Tom, "it is very generous of you to anticipate my request. It
                     is but a trifle that I need; and I will repay you soon."</p>
                  <p>I offered him the contents of my purse; but he would not take more than half a
                     dollar. "At least," said I, "allow me to treat you to a supper, since you say
                     you are hungry?"</p>
                  <p>"I will agree to that," he replied, "upon the condition that you favor me with
                     your company, and allow me to call for what I want."</p>
                  <p>Of course I could not refuse his proposition, and knowing what his former
                     habits had been, I supposed he would go into some of the splendid restaurants
                     on Broadway, and call for such a supper as he had once been accustomed to
                     indulge in. But, on the contrary, he led me into one of the cross streets, and
                     I followed him down into a very humble underground "Saloon," where he ordered a
                     supper of cold meat and bread, and I could not prevail upon him to indulge in
                     anything more.</p>
                  <p>"You know something of my history," said Tom, "how I once lived, and how I lost
                     my property; but how I have lived since, you do hot know, and I shall not
                     distress you by telling. Look," said he, and he unbuttoned his threadbare coat,
                     when I saw that he had on neither vest nor shirt. "I am actually reduced to
                     this extreme," said he, and his voice quivered as he spoke, "by trying to live
                     honestly. Up to this very hour, until I met you, I have not stooped to beg; but
                     now I was driven to it. I had nothing left by which I could raise a shilling,
                     and I had not tasted food to-day."</p>
                  <p>"Good heavens!" said I, "can this be true? What! Elegant Tom Dillar, with all
                     his accomplishments, his rich acquaintances, his knowledge of the world, and in
                     a city like this, where employment is so readily obtained, reduced to
                     starvation! It cannot be true."</p>
                  <pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7187-00000140"/>
                  <p>"But it is true," said Tom, "impossible as it may seem to you, and all because
                     I was not brought up to a regular profession. My accomplishments were not of a
                     kind to bring me money in an honorable way, and I made up my mind that if I
                     could not live honorably, I would prefer not to live at all. I could easily
                     have sold myself to unworthy or disreputable employments, or my former friends
                     would probably have been glad to have had me sing for them, and have rewarded
                     me by permitting me to live on their bounty, but I could not submit to such a
                     position as that. I could never be a jack-pudding of society; and I would not
                     disgrace my father's name by a dishonorable occupation."</p>
                  <p>As Tom spoke these words, he looked more elegant in his shabby suit than ever
                     he had done in his happier days; and in spite of his poverty, I could not but
                     still admire his manly spirit and self-reliance. I actually felt poor beside
                     him.</p>
                  <p>"But," said I, "why will you not allow me to lend you a larger sum than you
                     have taken? You shall be heartily welcome to more."</p>
                  <p>"Because," replied Tom, "it is all I need. I think I have found a placer, and
                     after this I shall be rich again."</p>
                  <p>I wished his expectations might be realized, and shaking his hand, I gave him
                     my card, and begged he would send to me, if he should need any further
                     assistance.</p>

                  <p>IT was about three months after I parted with Tom in the cheap restaurant,
                     that, as I entered the vestibule of the Astor House, I met him coming out of
                     that hotel. I started back with amazement as I saw him, for Tom was now dressed
                     with greater splendor than I had ever before seen him; not obtrusively made up,
                     but with an air of studied elegance that was new to him. Certainly he never
                     looked better, nor better deserved to be called Elegant Tom Dillar. He appeared
                     a little embarrassed when he first caught my eye, but his old manner soon
                     returned. "I owe you a trifle, I think," said he; "let me pay it." And he
                     pulled out a silk purse which seemed to be full of gold and silver, and reached
                     me a half-dollar.</p>
                  <p>"That is the principal," said he; "now do me the favor to accept this for
                     interest;" and he took a handsome sealring from his finger, which he put upon
                     mine. As our initials were the same, I do not know whether he had had it cut
                     for me or not; but seeing my cypher on the agate, I fancied he had, and did not
                     refuse it. I kept it among my most precious mementoes of past friendships, for
                     Tom Dillar is one of those persons whose acquaintance I regard as a feather in
                     my cap.</p>

               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
                  <p>THE reappearance of Elegant Tom Dillar in what is called society, was a topic
                     of universal conversation in fashionable circles, and once more invitations
                     began to pour in upon him, so that he might, if he had had the capacity, have
                     eaten three dinners daily at the very best houses in town, and have danced in
                     the most brilliant company that New York could afford, nearly every night. But
                     a great change was perceptible in Tom's manner. He was the same Elegant Tom
                     Dillar he had ever been; faultless in his manner, refined in his conversation,
                     incredible in dress, and handsomer, if possible, than before his retirement.
                     "But he is so subdued in his style," was the<pb n="280-281"
                        xml:id="VAC7187-00000141"/> remark of everybody. He never danced, and when
                     he was pressed to sing, he always evaded the request by pleading a slight
                     hoarseness. There used to be a slight dash of frivolity in Tom's conversation
                     and conduct, and he would abandon himself to all kinds of merriment; but now he
                     was rather grave, quiet, and dignified, and several ambitious young men made
                     most melancholy attempts to form themselves upon his style. Another of his
                     changes was, that he wore his hair cut very short, and his fine classical head
                     was improved by it. In fact, Tom's new style was infinitely more interesting,
                     becoming, and distingue than his old. Certain pious ladies got their heads
                     together, and, after discussing the matter, came to the conclusion that Tom
                     Dillar was preparing himself for the ministry. This suspicion even gave a new
                     interest to him, and he became more than ever an object of observation. But
                     this theory was soon exploded; for, if Tom was engaged in so pious an
                     occupation, under whose auspices was he studying? On hearing the report, Tom
                     smiled sarcastically, and raised his eyebrows as people do when they are both
                     surprised and amused, but did not deny it. But, if he was not studying for the
                     ministry, what was he doing, and how did he live? Where did he get his money?
                     for it was known that Tom paid as he went, and not a soul of his acquaintance
                     could accuse him of borrowing.</p>
                  <p>These questions began to grow extremely interesting and puzzling, for the
                     manner in which Tom had been cleaned out by his speculation in Pottawattamy
                     Coal Stock, by his friend, Pete Van Slicer, was as notorious as his subsequent
                     poverty, and retirement from the world. All sorts of expedients were resorted
                     to for the purpose of discovering the secret of Tom's income; but the mystery
                     baffled the keenest investigation, and the consequence was, that the wildest
                     conceivable stories were told about him, and he was regarded with looks of
                     suspicion, and treated with cold disdain by certain ladies who had marriageable
                     daughters. The excitement at last reached its calenture when it was discovered
                     that Julia Laurens, daughter of the celebrated and wealthy physician of that
                     name, and granddaughter of old Ormolu the auctioneer, one of the most beautiful
                     and fascinating girls in society, had actually fallen in love with Tom, and
                     that he had been forbidden her father's house because he refused to tell how he
                     gained his income.</p>
                  <p>The report of this interesting circumstance invested the mystery of Tom's
                     prosperity with a romantic interest, and the excitement became absolutely
                     furious. It was impossible to enter a house without hearing the subject
                     discussed, and even merchants talked about it on 'Change. The different
                     theories which were broached were highly instructive, inasmuch as they revealed
                     the many different methods by which a man may contrive to live without labor;
                     but it so happened that not one of them came within a thousand miles of the
                     truth. Tom had, in fact, discovered a placer, as he termed it, which he alone
                     knew how to work; and most discreetly did he keep his secret, until, in a
                     luckless moment, the merest accident revealed it.</p>
                  <p>The women, poor simple-minded creatures, knowing but little of the world, had
                     their own innocent surmises about Tom, the most plausible of which was, that he
                     had entered into a league with the —— some other ladies, who had a less
                     practical acquaintance with human possibilities believed that he got his money
                     by writing poems for the magazines; while others said that he gambled. But
                     Tom's regular habits, and his placidity of temper, were adverse to the last
                     supposition. The men, of course, gave shrewder guesses; and one party
                     maintained, with some plausibility, that Tom Dillar was employed as a
                        Russian<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7187-00000142"/> spy. The difficulty in
                     this case was, that he never received any foreign letters, was notoriously
                     ignorant of political movements, and never mingled in any society where he
                     would be likely to pick up any information that would interest the Emperor of
                     Russia. Another party maintained that he speculated in stocks; but that theory
                     was easily knocked in the head: Tom had hot been in Wall street since his
                     speculation in the Pottawattamy Coal Stock. Some ill-natured people hinted that
                     he was employed in circulating counterfeit money; but he was closely watched,
                     and was never known to pass off a bad bill. He was accused of picking pockets,
                     of buying lottery-tickets, and other disreputable practices: but the strict
                     integrity of Tom's conduct, and his perfect frankness on all subjects
                     concerning himself, except that impenetrable mystery of the source of his
                     income, put every ungenerous suspicion to rest. He was watched when he went
                     from a party, or the opera, and was always found to go directly to his
                     lodgings, and there, too, would he be found in the morning. Julia Laurens's
                     father had employed a police officer to dodge Tom's footsteps, and discover
                     what his haunts were; but the man could learn nothing more than was already
                     known. There was one rather striking peculiarity, however, about Tom's
                     movements, which might lead to the discovery of the mystery. Nobody had seen
                     him, except on Sunday nights, between the hours of seven and ten. Every place
                     of amusement in the city was ransacked in vain, during these hours, but no sign
                     of Tom Dillar could anywhere be found; and he continued to be a talk in
                     society, where he was still well received in spite of all the evil things that
                     were surmised about him.</p>
                  <p>Julia Laurens was a spirited girl, and she loved Tom the better, perhaps,
                     because he was the object of so much unjust suspicion; and her father, the
                     doctor, was charmed by Tom's intelligence, his gentlemanly manners, his fine
                     taste, and his amiability; and most happy would he have been to acknowledge him
                     as his son-in-law, but with the mysterious silence which he observed in respect
                     to his income. But, as Tom was resolute in his silence, the father of Julia was
                     inexorable, and there was nothing left for them but a clandestine marriage. The
                     lady hinted at her willingness, but Tom told her, dearly as he loved her, he
                     would not be guilty of a dishonorable act to obtain her. He would wait a little
                     longer, and perhaps her father would relent.</p>
                  <p>To fully appreciate Tom's noble conduct, it should be known that Julia, in
                     addition to her expectations from her father's property, which was already
                     large, and rapidly increasing, had property of her own, valued at fifty
                     thousand dollars, which had been bequeathed to her by an aunt. All this Tom
                     might have had, and the woman he loved besides, but for his high-minded sense
                     of honor.</p>

                  <p>DOCTOR LAURENS, Julia's father, was a most passionate lover of music, and you
                     were always sure of seeing him in his box at the opera, in his bright-buttoned
                     coat, with lorgnette in hand, listening to the prima donna as though she were a
                     patient, and he anticipated a fee at the close of the performance. He was so
                     catholic in his taste that he could enjoy one kind of music as well as another;
                     and when there was no opera, and his patients would permit it, he would go to
                     hear the Ethiopian minstrels, and sit through the entire performance. In fact
                     the banjo was one of the Doctor's weaknesses, and there were some<pb
                        n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7187-00000143"/> people who were uncharitable enough
                     to say that negro minstrelsy was much better adapted to his musical taste than
                     the Italian opera. But that was mere scandal, of course, for the Doctor had
                     been in Europe, and had brought back with him, like many other gentlemen who go
                     abroad, a taste for music and the fine arts, which he did not carry with
                     him.</p>
                  <p>There was one member of the Ethiopian band, where the Doctor was in the habit
                     of going, who had completely fascinated him; which was not much to be wondered
                     at, for he had fascinated everybody else who heard him; and when he appeared,
                     there was sure to be an overflowing house. The name of this incomparable singer
                     was Higgins, and his talents as a banjo-player, as a dancer, and a personator
                     of the negro character, particularly as the negro dandy, were equal to his
                     splendid abilities as a singer. The Doctor never failed to drop into the
                     Ethiopian opera, as it was called, whenever this public favorite appeared,
                     which was nearly every night, and seeing his name up on the bills for a
                     benefit, the Doctor resolved to go. On reaching the hall he found the house so
                     crowded that he could not even get his nose inside, but the door-keeper
                     recognized him, and wishing to gratify so distinguished a patron of the
                     establishment, offered to show him round by a private entrance, so that he
                     would be near the stage, and might retire at his leisure.</p>
                  <p>The Doctor was delighted, and put something handsome into the hand of the
                     door-keeper, as an acknowledgment for the favor. He got a comfortable seat near
                     the stage, and waited with impatience for the appearance of the incomparable
                     Higgins. The sham darkey was in splendid voice, and filled the audience with
                     ecstatic pleasure by his happy imitations of Dandy Jim. But his most brilliant
                     performance was in the plantation break-down, in which he ravished the
                     spectator tator by his unparalleled heeling and toeing. In the midst of the
                     performance, when the frenzy of the spectators was at its height, a boy in the
                     gallery threw a piece of orange-peel on the stage, and Higgins, by an unlucky
                     step, put his foot upon it, and fell with a tremendous crash. The audience at
                     first thought it a part of the dance, and applauded tremendously, but it was
                     soon discovered that the poor man had met with a serious accident. He was taken
                     up by his companions, and borne off the stage; directly after, the leader of
                     the band came on, and asked if there was a surgeon in the house, as Mr. Higgins
                     was badly hurt by his fall. Doctor Laurens was but too happy to have an
                     opportunity of rendering any professional service to so distinguished an artist
                     as Higgins; so he stepped promptly forward and offered his services. The artist
                     had struck his head, but was only stunned. The Doctor, however, did as all
                     doctors do on such occasions, whipped out his lancet, and bled the patient,
                     while one of his companions, with a bowl of water and a sponge, wiped the burnt
                     cork from the face of the unconscious minstrel.</p>
                  <p>Higgins presently opened his eyes, and stared wildly about him, while the
                     Doctor shrieked out,</p>
                  <p>"Good gracious, it is Elegant Tom Dillar!"</p>
                  <p>Tom was bewildered by the sudden change of the scene, and faint and sick from
                     the loss of the blood which Doctor Laurens had been letting out of his veins;
                     but, bewildered and weak as he was, the sound of the Doctor's voice, and the
                     sight of his astonished countenance, brought Tom to his senses. He knew at once
                     that his secret was discovered, and comprehended in a moment the consequences
                     that must follow its revelation to society.</p>
                  <p>"Doctor," said he, faintly, "it is no use to dissemble further. You know my
                     secret; let me request you to keep it to yourself."</p>
                  <pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7187-00000144"/>
                  <p>"Oh! my dear fellow," said the Doctor, 'you are perfectly safe in my hands;
                     don't be uneasy. For the credit of my own family, at least, I shall not be
                     likely to proclaim to any society that a gentleman who visited at my house is a
                     member of a troupe of Ethiopian minstrels. I wish you a good evening, sir."</p>
                  <p>It very oddly happened that, before midnight, all the members of the Manhattan
                     Club, to which the Doctor belonged, knew that Elegant Tom Dillar had retrieved
                     his fortunes by joining the Ethiopian minstrels, and the news was spread all
                     through society before the next day at noon.</p>
                  <p>Tom received a package early in the morning from Julia, inclosing all the
                     billets-doux and trinkets he had sent her, and requesting a return of all she
                     had ever sent him. The note was as devoid of feeling or sentiment as a lawyer's
                     dunning letter; and Tom wrote one in reply, which was quite as cold and
                     business-like.</p>
                  <p>"Well," said I to Tom, on meeting him a few days after his accident, which
                     would very likely have proved fatal to him but for his woolly wig, "do you
                     intend to give up society or the minstrels?"</p>
                  <p>"Society!" exclaimed Elegant Tom Dillar, with a sarcastic curve of his finely
                     chiselled lip; "society be ——."</p>
                  <p>I will not repeat the very coarse expression he used; for, since his new
                     associations, he has grown rather rude and low in his language.</p>
                  <p>"What should an honest man care for society?" said he. "When I was an idler,
                     living on the property which my father's industry had procured me, society
                     petted me and cherished me. When I lost my property, society turned a cold
                     shoulder to me, but petted the villain who had robbed me of it. When by an
                     honest exercise of the only accomplishments I had been taught, I was enabled to
                     appear like a gentleman, society again received me with open arms, although it
                     imagined I was a gambler or a pickpocket; but, when it was found that my money
                     was honestly obtained—that I wronged no one, or owed any one—society rejects me
                     again, and the girl who was willing to marry me as a swindler, turns her back
                     upon me as an honest man."</p>
                  <p>I am afraid that Tom was misanthropical; for, as he soon after became possessed
                     of a considerable fortune by the death of a relative, he quitted the minstrels
                     and went to Paris, where, I have heard, he still lives in great splendor, and
                     is famous for his dinners, to which none of his countrymen are ever
                     invited.</p>

                  <head>I.</head>
                  <p>THE Marchioness was at her toilet. Florine and Aspasia, her two ladies'-maids,
                     were busy powdering, as it were with hoar-frost, the bewitching widow.</p>
                  <p>She was a widow, this Marchioness; a widow of twenty-three; and wealthy, as
                     very few persons were any longer at the court of Louis XV., her godfather.</p>
                  <p>Three-and-twenty years earlier, his Majesty had held her at the baptismal font
                     of the chapel at Marly, and had settled upon her an income of a hundred
                     thousand livres, by way of proving to her father, the Baron Fontevrault, who
                     had saved his life at the battle of Fontenoy, that kings can be grateful,
                     whatever people choose to say to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>The Marchioness then was a widow. She resided, during the summer, in a charming
                     little chateau, situated half-way up the slope overhanging the water, on the
                     road from Bougival to Saint Germain. Madame Dubarry's estate adjoined hers; and
                     on opening her eyes she could see, without rising, the white gable-ends and the
                     wide-spreading chestnut-trees of Luciennes, perched upon the heights. On this
                     particular day—it was noon—the Marchioness, whilst her attendants dressed her
                     hair and arranged her head-dress with the most exquisite taste, gravely
                     employed herself in tossing up, alternately, a couple of fine oranges, which
                     crossed each other in the air, and then dropped into the white and delicate
                     hand that caught them in their fall.</p>
                  <p>This sleight-of-hand—which the Marchioness interrupted at times whilst she
                     adjusted a beauty-spot on her lip, or cast an impatient glance on the crystal
                     clock that told how time was running away with the fair widow's precious
                     moments—had lasted for ten minutes, when the folding-doors were thrown open,
                     and a valet, such as one sees now only on the stage, announced with pompous
                     voice—"The King!"</p>
                  <p>Apparently, the Marchioness was accustomed to such visits, for she but half
                     rose from her seat, as she saluted with her most gracious smile the personage
                     who entered.</p>
                  <p>It was indeed Louis XV. himself—Louis XV. at sixty-five; but robust, upright,
                     with smiling lip and beaming eye, and jauntily clad in a close-fitting,
                     pearl-grey hunting-suit, that became him to perfection. He carried under his
                     arm a handsome fowling-piece, inlaid with mother-of-pearl; a small pouch,
                     intended for ammunition alone, hung over his shoulder.</p>
                  <p>The King had come from Luciennes almost alone, that is to say, with a Captain
                     of the Guard, the old Marshal de Richelieu, and a single equerry on foot. He
                     had been amusing himself with quail-shooting, loading his own gun, as was the
                     fashion with his ancestors, the later Valois and the earlier Bourbons. His
                     grandsire, Henry IV., could not have been less ceremonious.</p>
                  <p>But a shower of hail had surprised him; and his Majesty had no relish for it.
                     He pretended that the fire of an enemy's battery was less disagreeable than
                     those drops of<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7187-00000146"/> water, so small and
                     so hard, that wet him through, and reminded him of his twinges of
                     rheumatism.</p>
                  <p>Fortunately, he was but a few steps from the gateway of the chateau when the
                     shower commenced. He had come, therefore, to take shelter with his goddaughter,
                     having dismissed his suite, and only keeping with him a magnificent pointer,
                     whose genealogy was fully established by the Duke de Richelieu, and traced
                     back, with a few slips in orthography, directly to Nisus, that celebrated
                     greyhound, given by Charles IX. to his friend Ronsard, the poet.</p>
                  <p>"Good-morning, Marchioness," said the King, as he entered, putting down his
                     fowling-piece in a corner, "I have come to ask your hospitality. We were caught
                     in a shower at your gate—Richelieu and I. I have packed off Richelieu."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, Sire, that wasn't very kind of you."</p>
                  <p>"Hush!" replied the King, in a good-humored tone. "It's only mid-day; and if
                     the Marshal had forced his way in here at so early an hour he would have
                     bragged of it everywhere, this very evening. He is very apt to compromise one,
                     and he is a great coxcomb, too, the old Duke. But don't put yourself out of the
                     way, Marchioness. Let Aspasia finish this becoming pile of your head-dress, and
                     Florine spread out with her silver knife the scented powder that blends so well
                     with the lilies and the roses of your bewitching face. Why, Marchioness, you're
                     so pretty, one could eat you up!"</p>
                  <p>"You think me so, Sire?"</p>
                  <p>"I tell you so every day. Oh, what fine oranges!"</p>
                  <p>And the King seated himself upon the roomy sofa, by the side of the
                     Marchioness, whose rosy finger-tips he kissed with an infinity of grace. Then,
                     taking up one of the oranges that he had admired, he proceeded leisurely to
                     examine it.</p>
                  <p>"But," said he at length, "what are oranges doing by the side of your Chinese
                     powder-box and your scent-bottles? Is there any connection between this fruit
                     and the maintenance—easy as it is, Marchioness—of your charms?"</p>
                  <p>"These oranges," replied the lady, gravely, "fulfilled just now, Sire, the
                     functions of destiny."</p>
                  <p>The King opened wide his eyes, and stroked the long ears of his dog, by way of
                     giving the Marchioness time to explain her meaning.</p>
                  <p>"It was the Countess who gave them to me," she continued.</p>
                  <p>"Madame Dubarry?"</p>
                  <p>"Exactly so, Sire."</p>
                  <p>"A trumpery gift, it seems to me, Marchioness."</p>
                  <p>"I hold it, on the contrary, to be an important one; since I repeat to your
                     Majesty, that these oranges decide my fate."</p>
                  <p>"I give it up," said the King.</p>
                  <p>"Imagine, Sire; yesterday I found the Countess occupied in tossing her oranges
                     up and down this way." And the Marchioness recommenced her game with a skill
                     that cannot be described.</p>
                  <p>"I see," said the King; "she accompanied this singular amusement with the
                     words, 'Up, Choiseul! up Praslin!' and, on my word, I can fancy how the pair
                     jumped."</p>
                  <p>"Precisely so, Sire."</p>
                  <p>"And do you dabble in politics, Marchioness? Have you a fancy for uniting with
                     the Countess, just to mortify my poor ministers?"</p>
                  <p>"By no means, Sire; for, in place of Monsieur de Choiseul and the Duke de
                     Praslin, I was saying to myself just now, 'Up, Menneval! up, Beaugency!'"</p>
                  <p>"Aye, aye," returned the King; "and why the deuce would you have them jumping,
                     those two good-looking<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7187-00000147"/>
                     gentlemen—Monsieur de Menneval, who is a Crœsus, and Monsieur de Beaugency, who
                     is a statesman, and dances the minuet to perfection."</p>
                  <p>"I'll tell you," said the dame. "You know, Sire, that Monsieur de Menneval is
                     an accomplished gentleman, a handsome man, a gallant cavalier, an indefatigable
                     dancer, witty as Monsieur Arouet, and longing for nothing so much as to live in
                     the country, on his estate in Touraine, on the banks of the Loire, with the
                     woman whom he loves or will love, far from the court, from grandeur and from
                     turmoil."</p>
                  <p>"And, on my life, he's in the right of it," quoth the King. "One does become so
                     wearied at court."</p>
                  <p>"Aye, and no," rejoined the widow, as she put on her last beauty-spot. "Nor are
                     you unaware, Sire, that Monsieur de Beaugency is one of the most brilliant
                     courtiers of Marly and of Versailles; ambitious; burning with zeal for the
                     service of your Majesty; as brave as Monsieur de Menneval; and capable of going
                     to the end of the earth with the title of Ambassador of the King of
                     France."</p>
                  <p>"I know that," chimed in Louis XV., with a laugh. "But, alas, I have more
                     ambassadors than embassies. My antechambers overflow every morning."</p>
                  <p>"Now," continued the Marchioness, "I have been a widow these two years
                     past."</p>
                  <p>"A long time, there's no denying."</p>
                  <p>"Ah," sighed she, "there's no need to tell me so, Sire. But Monsieur de
                     Menneval loves me at least he says so, and I am easily persuaded."</p>
                  <p>"Very well; then marry Monsieur de Menneval."</p>
                  <p>"I have thought of it, Sire; and, in truth, I might do much worse. I should
                     like well enough to live in the country, under the willow-trees, on the borders
                     of the river, with a husband, fond, yielding, loving, who would detest the
                     philosophers and set some little value on the poets. When no external noises
                     disturb the honeymoon, that month, Sire, may be indefinitely prolonged. In the
                     country, you know, one never hears a noise."</p>
                  <p>"Unless it be the north wind moaning in the corridor, and the rain pattering on
                     the window-panes." And the King shivered slightly on his sofa.</p>
                  <p>"But," added the dame, "Monsieur de Beaugency loves me equally well."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, ha! the ambitious man!"</p>
                  <p>"Ambition does not shut out love, Sire. Monsieur de Beaugency is a marquis; he
                     is twenty-five; he is ambitious. I should like a husband vastly who was longing
                     to reach high office of state. Greatness has its own particular merit."</p>
                  <p>"Then marry Monsieur de Beaugency."</p>
                  <p>"I have thought of that, also; but this poor Monsieur de Menneval."</p>
                  <p>"Very good," exclaimed the King, laughing: "now I see to what purposes the
                     oranges are destined. Monsieur de Menneval pleases you; Monsieur de Beaugency
                     would suit you just as well; and since one can't have more than one husband,
                     you make them each jump in turn."</p>
                  <p>"Just so, Sire. But observe what happens."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, what does happen?"</p>
                  <p>"That, unwilling and unable to play unfairly, I take equal pains to catch the
                     two oranges as they come down; and that I catch them both, each time."</p>
                  <p>"Well, are you willing that I should take part in your game?"</p>
                  <p>"You, Sire? Ah, what a joke that would be!"</p>
                  <p>"I am very clumsy, Marchioness. To a certainty, in less than three minutes
                     Beaugency and Menneval will be rolling on the floor."</p>
                  <pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7187-00000148"/>
                  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed the lady; "and if you have any preference for one or the
                     other?"</p>
                  <p>"No; we'll do better. Look, I take the two oranges you mark them carefully—or,
                     better still, you stick into one of them one of these toilet pins, making up
                     your own mind which of the two is to represent Monsieur de Beaugency, and
                     leaving me, on that point, entirely in the dark. If Monsieur de Beaugency touch
                     the floor, you shall marry his rival; if it happen just otherwise, you shall
                     resign yourself to become an ambassadress."</p>
                  <p>"Excellent! Now, Sire, let's see the result."</p>
                  <p>The King took the two oranges and plied shuttle with them above his head. But,
                     at the third pass, the two rolled down upon the embroidered carpet, and the
                     Marchioness broke out into a merry fit of laughter.</p>
                  <p>"I foresaw as much," exclaimed his Majesty. "What a clumsy fellow I am!"</p>
                  <p>"And we more puzzled than ever, Sire!"</p>
                  <p>"So we are, Marchioness; but the best thing we can do is to slice the oranges,
                     sugar them well, and season them with a dash of West India rum. Then you can
                     beg me to taste them, and offer me some of those preserved cherries and peaches
                     that you put up just as nicely as my daughter Adelaide."</p>
                  <p>"And Monsieur de Menneval? and Monsieur de Beaugency?" said the Marchioness, in
                     piteous accents. "How is the question to be settled?"</p>
                  <p>Louis XV. began to cogitate.</p>
                  <p>"Are you quite sure," said he, "that both of them are in love with you."</p>
                  <p>"Probably so," returned she, with a little coquettish smile, sent back to her
                     from the mirror opposite.</p>
                  <p>"And their love is equally strong?"</p>
                  <p>"I trust so, Sire."</p>
                  <p>"And I don't believe a word of it."</p>
                  <p>"Ah!" said the Marchioness; "but that is, in truth, a most terrible
                     supposition. Besides, Sire, they are on their way hither."</p>
                  <p>"Both of them?"</p>
                  <p>"One after the other: the Marquis at one o'clock precisely; the Baron at two. I
                     promised them my decision to-morrow, on condition that they would pay me a
                     final visit to-day."</p>
                  <p>As the Marchioness finished, the valet, who had announced the King, came to
                     inform his mistress that Monsieur de Beaugency was in the drawing-room, and
                     solicited the favor of admission to pay his respects.</p>
                  <p>"Capital!" said Louis XV., smiling as though he were eighteen; "show Monsieur
                     de Beaugency in. Marchioness, you will receive him, and tell him the price that
                     you set upon your hand."</p>
                  <p>"And what is this price, Sire?"</p>
                  <p>"You must give him the choice—either to renounce you, or to consent to send in
                     to me his resignation of his appointments, in order that he may go and bury
                     himself with his wife on his estate of Courlac, in Poitou, there to live the
                     life of a country gentleman.'</p>
                  <p>"And then, Sire?"</p>
                  <p>"You will allow him a couple of hours for reflection, and so dismiss him."</p>
                  <p>"And in the end?"</p>
                  <p>"The rest is my concern."—And the King got up, taking his dog and his gun, and
                     concealed himself behind a screen, drawing also a curtain, that he might be
                     completely hidden.</p>
                  <p>"What is your intention, Sire?" asked the Marchioness.</p>
                  <p>"I conceal myself, like the kings of Persia, from the<pb n="296-297"
                        xml:id="VAC7187-00000149"/> eyes of my subjects," replied Louis XV. "Hush,
                     Marchioness."</p>
                  <p>A few moments later, and Monsieur de Beaugency entered the room.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>II.</head>
                  <p>The Marquis was a charming cavalier; tall, slight, with a moustache black and
                     curling upwards, an eye sparkling and intelligent, a Roman nose, an Austrian
                     lip, a firm step, a noble and imposing presence.</p>
                  <p>The Marchioness blushed slightly at sight of him, but offered him her hand to
                     kiss; and as she begged him by a gesture to be seated, thus inwardly took
                     counsel with herself:</p>
                  <p>"Decidedly, I believe that the test is useless; it is Monsieur de Beaugency
                     whom I love. How proud shall I be to lean upon his arm at the court-fêtes! With
                     what delight shall I keep long watches in the cabinet of his Excellency the
                     Ambassador, while he is busy with his Majesty's affairs!"</p>
                  <p>But after this "aside," the Marchioness resumed her gracious and coquettish
                     air; as though the woman comprehended the mission of refined gallantry which
                     was reserved for her seductive and delicate epoch by an indulgent Providence,
                     that laid by its anger and its evil days for the subsequent reign.</p>
                  <p>"Marchioness," said Monsieur de Beaugency, as he held in his hands the rosy
                     fingers of the lovely widow, "it is fully a week since you received me!"</p>
                  <p>"A week? why, you were here yesterday!"</p>
                  <p>"Then I must have counted the hours for ages."</p>
                  <p>"A compliment which may be found in one of the younger Crebillon's books!"</p>
                  <p>"You are hard upon me, Marchioness."</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps so, it comes naturally I am tired."</p>
                  <p>"Ah, Marchioness! Heaven knows that I would make of your existence one
                     never-ending fête!"</p>
                  <p>"That would, at least, be wearisome."</p>
                  <p>"Say a word, Madam, one single word, and my fortune, my future prospects, my
                     ambition!"—</p>
                  <p>"You are still, then, as ambitious as ever?"</p>
                  <p>"More than ever, since I have been in love with you."</p>
                  <p>"Is that necessary?"</p>
                  <p>"Beyond a doubt. Ambition—what is it but honors, wealth, the envious looks of
                     impotent rivals, the admiration of the crowd, the favor of monarchs? And is not
                     one's love unanswerably and most triumphantly proved, in laying all this at the
                     feet of the woman whom one adores?"</p>
                  <p>"You may be right."</p>
                  <p>"I may be right, Marchioness! Listen to me, my fair lady-love."</p>
                  <p>"I am all attention, sir."</p>
                  <p>"Between us, who are well-born, and consort not with plebeians, that vulgar and
                     sentimental sort of love which is painted by those who write books for your
                     mantua-makers and chambermaids, would be in exceedingly bad taste. It would be
                     but slighting love and making no account of its enjoyment, were we to go and
                     bury it in some obscure corner of the provinces, or of Paris—we, who belong to
                     Versailles—living away there with it, in monotonous solitude and unchanging
                     contemplation!"</p>
                  <p>"Ah!" said the Marchioness, "you think so?"</p>
                  <p>"Tell me, rather, of fêtes that dazzle one with lights,<pb n="298-299"
                        xml:id="VAC7187-00000150"/> with noise, with smiles, with wit, through which
                     one glides intoxicated, with the fair conquest in triumph on one's arm Why hide
                     one's happiness, in place of parading it? The jealousy of the world does but
                     increase, and cannot diminish it. My uncle, the Cardinal, stands well at court.
                     He has the King's ear, and better still, the Countess's. He will, ere long,
                     procure me one of the Northern embassies. Cannot you fancy yourself, Madame the
                     Ambassadress, treading on the platform of a drawing-room, as royalty with
                     royalty, with the highest nobility of a kingdom—having the men at your feet,
                     and the women on lower seats around you, whilst you yourself are occupant of a
                     throne, and wield a sceptre?"</p>
                  <p>And as Monsieur de Beaugency warmed with his own eloquence, he gently slid from
                     his seat to the knees of the Marchioness, whose hand he covered with
                     kisses.</p>
                  <p>She listened to him, with a smile on her lips, and then abruptly said to
                     him:</p>
                  <p>"Rise, sir, and hear me in turn. Are you in truth sincerely attached to
                     me?"</p>
                  <p>"With my whole soul, Marchioness!"</p>
                  <p>"Are you prepared to make every sacrifice?"</p>
                  <p>"Every one, Madam."</p>
                  <p>"That is fortunate indeed; for to be prepared for all, is to accomplish one,
                     without the slightest difficulty; and it is but a single one that I
                     require."</p>
                  <p>"Oh, speak! Must a throne be conquered?"</p>
                  <p>"By no means, sir. You must only call to mind that you own a fine chateau in
                     Poitou."</p>
                  <p>"Pooh!" said Monsieur de Beaugency; "a shed."</p>
                  <p>"Every man's house is his castle," replied the widow. "And having called it to
                     mind, you need only order post-horses."</p>
                  <p>"For what purpose?"</p>
                  <p>"To carry me off to Courlac. It is there that your almoner shall unite us, in
                     the chapel, in presence of your domestics and your vassals, our only
                     witnesses."</p>
                  <p>"A singular whim, Marchioness; but I submit to it."</p>
                  <p>"Very well. We will set out this evening. Ah! I forgot."</p>
                  <p>"What, further?"</p>
                  <p>"Before starting, you will send in your resignation to the King."</p>
                  <p>Monsieur de Beaugency almost bounded from his seat.</p>
                  <p>"Do you dream of that, Marchioness?"</p>
                  <p>"Assuredly. You will not, at Courlac, be able to perform your duties at
                     court."</p>
                  <p>"And on returning?"</p>
                  <p>"We will not return."</p>
                  <p>"We will—not—return!" slowly ejaculated Monsieur de Beaugency. "Where then
                     shall we proceed?"</p>
                  <p>"Nowhere. We will remain at Courlac."</p>
                  <p>"All the summer?"</p>
                  <p>"And all the winter. I count upon settling myself there, after our marriage. I
                     have a horror of the court. I do not like the turmoil. Grandeur wearies me I
                     look forward only to a simple and charming country life, to the tranquil and
                     happy existence of the forgotten lady of the castle. What matters it to you?
                     You were ambitious for my love's sake. I care but little for ambition; you
                     ought to care for it still less, since you are in love with me."</p>
                  <p>"But, Marchioness—"</p>
                  <p>"Hush! it's a bargain. Still, for form's sake, I give you one hour to reflect.
                     There, pass out that way; go into the winter drawing-room that you will find at
                     the end of the gallery, and send me your answer upon a leaf<pb n="300-301"
                        xml:id="VAC7187-00000151"/> of your tablets. I am about to complete my
                     toilet, which I left unfinished, to receive you."</p>
                  <p>And the Marchioness opened a door, bowed Monsieur de Beaugency into the
                     corridor, and closed the door upon him.</p>
                  <p>"Marchioness," cried the King, from his hiding-place and through the screen,
                     "you will offer Monsieur de Menneval the embassy to Prussia, which I promise
                     you for him."</p>
                  <p>"And you will not emerge from your retreat?"</p>
                  <p>"Certainly not, Madame; it is far more amusing to remain behind the scenes. One
                     hears all, laughs at one's ease, and is not troubled with saying anything."</p>
                  <p>It struck two. Monsieur de Menneval was announced. His Majesty remained snug,
                     and shammed dead.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>III.</head>
                  <p>Monsieur de Menneval was, at all points, a cavalier who yielded nothing to his
                     rival, Monsieur de Beaugency. He was fair. He had a blue eye, a broad forehead,
                     a mouth that wore a dreamy expression, and that somewhat pensive air which
                     became so well the troubadours of France in the olden time.</p>
                  <p>We cannot say whether Monsieur de Menneval had perpetrated verse; but he loved
                     the poets, the arts, the quiet of the fields, the sunsets, the rosy dawn, the
                     breeze sighing through the foliage, the low and mysterious tones of the harp,
                     sounding at eve from the light bark shooting over the blue waters of the
                     Loire—all things, in short, that harmonize with that melodious concert of the
                     heart, which passes by the name of love.</p>
                  <p>He was timid, but he passionately loved the beautiful widow; and his dearest
                     dream was of passing his whole life at her feet, in well-chosen retirement, far
                     from those envious lookers-on who are ever ready to fling their sarcasms on
                     quiet happiness, and who dissemble their envy under cloak of a philosophic
                     scepticism.</p>
                  <p>He trembled as he entered the Marchioness's boudoir. He remained standing
                     before her, and blushed as he kissed her hand. At length, encouraged by a
                     smile, emboldened by the solemnity of this coveted interview, he spoke to her
                     of his love, with a poetic simplicity and an unpremeditated warmth of heart—the
                     genuine enthusiasm of a priest who has faith in the object of his
                     adoration.</p>
                  <p>And as he spoke, the Marchioness sighed, and said within herself:</p>
                  <p>"He is right. Love is happiness. Love is to be two indeed, but one at the same
                     time; and to be free from those importunate intermeddlers, the indifference or
                     the mocking attention of the world."</p>
                  <p>She remembered, however, the advice of the King, and thus addressed the
                     baron:</p>
                  <p>"What will you indeed do, in order to convince me of your affection?"</p>
                  <p>"All that man can do."</p>
                  <p>The baron was less bold than Monsieur de Beaugency, who had talked of
                     conquering a throne. He was probably more sincere.</p>
                  <p>"I am ambitious," said the widow.</p>
                  <p>"Ah!" replied Monsieur de Menneval, sorrowfully.</p>
                  <p>"And I would that the man whom I marry should aspire to everything, and achieve
                     everything."</p>
                  <p>"I will try so to do, if you wish it."</p>
                  <p>"Listen; I give you an hour to reflect. I am, you know, the King's goddaughter.
                     I have begged of him an embassy for you."</p>
                  <pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7187-00000152"/>
                  <p>"Ah!" said Monsieur de Menneval, with indifference.</p>
                  <p>"He has granted my request. If you love me, you will accept the offer. We will
                     be married this evening, and your Excellency the Ambassador to Prussia will set
                     off for Berlin immediately after the nuptials. Reflect; I grant you an
                     hour."</p>
                  <p>"It is useless," answered Monsieur de Menneval; "I have no need of reflection,
                     for I love you. Your wishes are my orders; to obey you is my only desire. I
                     accept the embassy."</p>
                  <p>"Never mind!" said she, trembling with joy, and blushing deeply. "Pass into the
                     room, wherein you were just now waiting. I must complete my toilet, and I shall
                     then be at your service. I will summon you."</p>
                  <p>The Marchioness handed out the Baron by the right-hand door, as she had handed
                     out the Marquis by the left, and then said to herself:</p>
                  <p>"I shall be prettily embarrassed, if Monsieur de Beaugency should consent to
                     end his days at Courlac!"</p>
                  <p>Thereupon the King removed the screen and reappeared.</p>
                  <p>His Majesty stepped quietly to the round table, whereon he had replaced the
                     oranges, and took up one of them.</p>
                  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed the Marchioness, "I perceive, Sire, that you foresee the
                     difficulty that is about to spring up, and go back accordingly to the oranges,
                     in order to settle it."</p>
                  <p>As his sole reply, Louis XV. took a small ivory-handled penknife from his
                     waistcoat pocket, made an incision in the rind of the orange, peeled it off
                     very neatly, divided the fruit into two parts, and offered one to the
                     astonished Marchioness.</p>
                  <p>"But, Sire, what are you doing?" was her eager inquiry.</p>
                  <p>"You see that I am eating the orange."</p>
                  <p>"But—"</p>
                  <p>"It was of no manner of use to us."</p>
                  <p>"You have decided, then?"</p>
                  <p>"Unquestionably. Monsieur de Menneval loves you better than Monsieur de
                     Beaugency."</p>
                  <p>"That is not quite certain yet; let us wait."</p>
                  <p>"Look," said the King, pointing to the valet, who entered with a note from the
                     Marquis. "You'll soon see."</p>
                  <p>The widow opened the note, and read:</p>
                  <p>"Madam, I love you—Heaven is my witness; and to give you up is the most cruel
                     of sacrifices. But I am a gentleman. A gentleman belongs to the King. My life,
                     my blood are his. I cannot, without forfeit of my loyalty, abandon his
                     service——."</p>
                  <p>"Et cetera," chimed in the King, "as was observed by the Abbé Fleury, my tutor.
                     Marchioness, call in Monsieur Menneval."</p>
                  <p>Monsieur de Menneval entered, and was greatly troubled to see the King in the
                     widow's boudoir.</p>
                  <p>"Baron," said his Majesty, "Monsieur de Beaugency was deeply in love with the
                     Marchioness; but he was more deeply still in love—since he would not renounce
                     it to please her—with the embassy to Prussia, And you, you love the Marchioness
                     much better than you love me, since you would only enter my service for her
                     sake. This leads me to believe that you would be but a lukewarm public servant,
                     and that Monsieur de Beaugency will make an excellent ambassador. He will start
                     for Berlin this evening; and you shall marry the Marchioness. I will be present
                     at the ceremony."</p>
                  <p>"Marchioness," whispered Louis XV., in the ear of his goddaughter, "true love
                     is that which does not shrink from a sacrifice."</p>
                  <pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC7187-00000153"/>
                  <p>And the King peeled the second orange and eat it, as he placed the hand of the
                     widow in that of the Baron.</p>
                  <p>Then he added:</p>
                  <p>"I have been making three persons happy: the Marchioness, whose indecision I
                     have relieved; the Baron, who shall marry her; and Monsieur de Beaugency, who
                     will perchance prove a sorry ambassador. In all this, I have only neglected my
                     own interests, for I have been eating the oranges without sugar. And yet they
                     pretend to say that I am a selfish Monarch!"</p>

               <head>XVI. UNCLE BERNARD'S STORY.</head>
               <p>"OH! Uncle Bernard," cried altogether a group of little people, "tell us a
                  story."</p>
               <p>Uncle Bernard, a white-haired old man, whose easy-chair had been drawn to a warm
                  corner, for the winter was howling against the windows, looked up from his
                  large-print Bible and smiled fondly on their rosy faces:</p>
               <p>"A story! let me read you one out of this good book."</p>
               <p>"Oh! no," says bold little Bob, as he caught the old man round the neck, "we know
                  all the Bible stories; tell us a fairy tale!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes! Uncle Bernard," chomped the rest, "a fairy tale, a fairy tale, a fairy
                  tale; you have never told us a fairy tale."</p>
               <p>"No, dears, I have never told you a fairy tale. Fairy tales are lies, and young
                  folks, like you, should not love to hear lies, nor old folks like me should not
                  tell lies."</p>
               <p>"Oh! but Uncle Bernard, we know that fairy tales ain't true, but it is such fun to
                  hear them."</p>
               <p>"Well, my pets, I'll try to tell you a story that sounds like a fairy tale, and
                  yet is all true. Sit down and listen:</p>
               <p>"Once upon a time, and a great while ago, there lived in a wide wood a wild man,
                  whose name was <hi rend="i"/>Sthenos. His father and mother had been keepers of a
                  lovely garden, where they dwelt in peace with our good God; but he, very early in
                  his childhood, had wandered far off<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7187-00000154"/> and
                  lost himself among the shadows of the forest, where he soon forgot all the little
                  that he knew. Not only his head and face, but also his whole body, was covered
                  with long shaggy hair; his nails were like claws, and he could climb the trees or
                  swim in the water as easily as walk on the ground. Gigantic in height, his
                  shoulders were broad and his limbs sturdy. He could outrun the swiftest deer, hit
                  with a stone the flying bird, and kill with his knotty club the fiercest beasts.
                  He ate only what he won in the chase, with some pleasant herbs, or fruits, or
                  honey, which he found in hollow trunks, and among the rocks; and he drank only
                  water from springs, or the deep river which flowed through the valley. He slept in
                  caves or in the crotches of trees, lest the prowling beasts should catch him
                  unawares. Yet, savage as he was, he had a certain nobleness and rough grace of
                  mien which distinguished him as superior to the brutes around him, and made them
                  acknowledge him as their lord. Thus he lived lonely and unhappy, and,
                  notwithstanding his strength, full of fears.</p>
               <p>"One day as he was pushing through a thicket to reach the river, he heard singing
                  sweeter than any he had ever heard. He thought at first that it was a bird; but he
                  knew the songs of all birds, and that this was not like any one of them. He dashed
                  on, and saw reclining on the bank of the river a creature so lovely that he stood
                  still in wonder, trembling with a new feeling that shot like fire through his
                  heart and joints. Her form (his woodman's eye saw at once that the delicate
                  proportions were those of a female) was something like his own; but fair and
                  elegant, while his was brown and shaggy. Around her was cast a loose white robe,
                  and about her shoulders floated a scarf, blue as the sky. While she sung she
                  looked upwards as if some one was hearing her, whom Sthenos could not see, and
                  then she listened as if to a voice lie could not hear. Soon turning her eyes upon
                  him, she smiled with ravishing sweetness, and beckoned him nearer. Awe-struck, but
                  drawn irresistibly on, he fell at her feet, gazing on her beautiful face. She
                  spoke in accents of his early speech, which now came back to his understanding,
                  and said: "'Sthenos, our good God, whom you have so long forgotten, has not
                  forgotten, you; but pitying your loneliness and misery, has sent me to live with
                  you and be your friend. Already I love you, and you must take me to your heart and
                  give me your love.'</p>
               <p>"As she spoke she bent down and wiped his forehead, from which she had parted his
                  matted locks, looking with her clear blue eyes into his, until his whole being
                  seemed drawn out to her, and he laid her head with its bright golden curls on his
                  broad breast, and felt an ecstasy of inexpressible happiness.</p>
               <p>"'And now that I am to dwell with you, dear Sthenos, lead me to your home!'</p>
               <p>"'Home!' replied he, 'I know not what you mean!'</p>
               <p>"'Where do you rest after the chase, or amidst the darkness? Where do you eat your
                  food, and where do you most delight to be? That is home.'</p>
               <p>"'I have no home. All places in the forest are alike to me. Where weariness or
                  night come upon me, there I lie down; when I have killed the deer then I eat. I
                  have never thought of a home.'</p>
               <p>"'Come, then,' said she, sweetly; 'let us seek a spot where we will make a home
                  for ourselves;' and putting her slender hand in his, she led him on until they
                  came to a fountain gushing out from under a high rock, before which a sunny meadow
                  spread itself towards the southwest, blooming with harebells, and daisy-cups, and
                  pansies, and many more wild flowers. 'Is it not charming?' said she; 'the spring
                  shall give us water, and the rock guard<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7187-00000155"/>
                  us from the fierce north wind, and we can look out upon the sunlight and the
                  shadows as they float mingled together over the green grass and the flowers that
                  spring up through the verdure.'</p>
               <p>"Sthenos smiled, and though he could not understand all her meaning, he felt a
                  charm of nature he had never before known.</p>
               <p>"'Now,' she said, 'the sun, though its light be pleasant, looks down too hotly
                  upon us, and when the night comes the dews will fall and the winds chill us. Go,
                  break off boughs from the trees, and strip the broad bark from the decayed
                  birches.' This was an easy task for the vigorous man; and in the meantime she had
                  gathered heaps of dry mosses, and the spicy shoots from the hemlocks, and spread
                  them deeply over the leaf-covered ground. Then leaning the thick boughs against
                  each other, and laying, by her directions, the curved bark, overlapping in
                  successive and continuous layers upon them, Sthenos saw as his work a rude, but
                  safe hut, and said: 'This shall be our home. I go for our evening meal;' and
                  dashing into the forest, he soon returned with wood-pigeons and a young fawn,
                  which he had killed, casting them bleeding at the feet of his gentle wife, who had
                  already arranged in leafy cups the berries which she had gathered from the meadow;
                  and Sthenos beheld wild flowers, mingled with long, trailing, delicate vines,
                  adorning the entrance of their home.</p>
               <p>"The simple meal soon prepared by her skilful hands, he thought more savory than
                  he had ever had; but before she had suffered him to partake, she pointed upwards,
                  and with clasped hands sang praises to our good God the giver. An hour of
                  delicious friendship stole away, as hand in hand they looked into each other's
                  eyes—thoughts he knew not how to speak, and she needed no words to utter. Then
                  another hymn to our good God, the sleepless Preserver, she warbled from her lips
                  of gurgling melody, and the pair sank to rest.</p>
               <p>"Thus sped on day after day and night after night. Gradually Sthenos lost his
                  fierceness, save in the struggles of the chase. She had fashioned for him soft
                  garments out of fawn-skins and feathers, which now he wore less from need than
                  pride, and to please his skilful friend. His shaggy hair was smoothed into curling
                  grace; the hut constantly received new conveniences and ornaments from his strong
                  or her cunning hand; and happy was he, after his toils in the forest, to return
                  bearing a rich honeycomb, or leading a goat with full udders to his home, dear
                  because hers.</p>
               <p>"On waking one dewy morning, he looked fondly in her loving face beaming with
                  tender, holy thoughts, and said: 'You call me Sthenos, but have never told me the
                  name by which I am to call you, my dearest.'</p>
               <p>"'You have just pronounced the name I love best, except when you call me your wife
                  and your friend. I have had several names in the land whence I came to be near
                  you; but that by which our good God wishes you to know me is Enthymia. And, dear
                  Sthenos, whenever you are in trouble, in need, or in doubt, call Enthymia to your
                  side, and whatever love can do, I will gladly perform. With your strength and my
                  affectionate zeal, and the blessing of our good God, we shall be happy as we may
                  in this wild wood; but the good God has promised me that when you shall have
                  learned to sing and pray with me, that our two beings shall be blended into one,
                  and we shall leave the forest to go and dwell in a garden with our good God, far
                  more beautiful than the one from which you strayed a long while ago.'</p>
               <p>"'Oh, happy hope,' replied Sthenos, 'I can think of no<pb n="310-311"
                     xml:id="VAC7187-00000156"/> higher bliss than that your loveliness should be
                  mingled with my strength, except that my strength shall be for ever united to your
                  dear thoughts.'</p>
               <p>"'Say not so, Sthenos,' answered she, looking up with a holy smile, like morning
                  light sparkling in the dew; 'our highest joy will be to dwell with our good
                  God.'</p>
               <p>"From that moment Sthenos earnestly endeavored to learn the hymns and prayers of
                  Enthymia. They lived long in the forest, and children were born to them, three
                  sons like their father, vigorous,—three daughters like their mother, graceful. But
                  one fair morning the father and the mother came not from their chamber (for the
                  little hut had given place to a wide dwelling); their children went anxiously in
                  to seek them, but they found them not. Sthenos and Enthymia were gone to the
                  garden of our good God.</p>
               <p>"The children were mute in wonder and sadness, when suddenly the chamber was
                  filled with ravishing light and delicious odors, and three radiant angels hovered
                  over the bed; and the roof opened, and the children could see far up into the sky,
                  and saw a glorious being standing under the Tree of Life, before the throne of
                  God; and in the smiling countenance of the glorious being they recognized
                  strangely, but sweetly mingled, the love of both father and mother. And one of the
                  angels said (he was the tallest of the three); 'I pointed out the way to them and
                  encouraged them to strive to reach the garden.'</p>
               <p>"'And I,' said the second, on whose bosom shone a gem like a golden anchor, 'bore
                  them up on my wings.'</p>
               <p>"'And I,' joyfully exclaimed the third, who had eyes like the first spring violets
                  washed with rain, 'have made them both one for ever.'</p>
               <p>"Then turning to her sister angels, she said: 'Your tasks for them are over; but I
                  go to fill their united being with immortal happiness.'"</p>
               <p>"Ah! Uncle Bernard," cried Gertrude, "that is better than a fairy tale; but what
                  queer names, Sthenos and Enthymia; what do they mean?"</p>
               <p>"I made them out of the Greek," answered the old man; "and by Sthenos, I mean man
                  left to himself, when he would be a mere savage; and by Enthymia, I mean wisdom
                  sent to him by our good God, to teach him how to live on earth and prepare for
                  heaven. When man is transformed to holy wisdom and uses his strength for wise
                  ends, he becomes all good, and God takes him up to the second Paradise."</p>
               <p>"Yes," says little Charley; "and the angel with the anchor, is Hope."</p>
               <p>"And the tallest angel is Faith," adds Robert; "for faith gives pious people
                  courage."</p>
               <p>"And the gentle blue-eyed one must be Love, for love lives for ever," whispers
                  Gertrude in Uncle Bernard's ear.</p>
               <p>"Bless you, dear child, you look like her," whispered back Uncle Bernard.</p>

               <head>XVII. HOW I CAME TO BE MARRIED.</head>
               <p>I PROMISED William Hepburne to tell him how I came to be married; and as it was
                  rather an odd way, perhaps it will amuse the public; so here goes! My name is
                  Thomas Petition Stevens; I was born and bred in Connecticut, taught my letters,
                  and the "three Rs, Readin', 'Ritin', and 'Rithmetic," in a district school-house;
                  learned Latin, Greek, and algebra of old Parson Field, and grew tobacco enough on
                  my father's farm, before I was twenty, to help me squeeze through the college
                  course at old Yale.</p>
               <p>There I found myself one Commencement-day, having delivered the third oration to a
                  blooming audience in the galleries, and a grim crowd below, the happy possessor of
                  a sheepskin, a blue ribbon, a wooden spoon, two dollars and fifty-six cents, and
                  two suits of clothes, one very shabby, and one pie-new. "The world was all before
                  me where to choose," as it says in the primer; and I decided to go up into
                  Colebrook, and see if my maternal uncle, Seth Downes, wanted a man to help get in
                  his rowen. I paid two dollars and fifty cents to get there, and landed on the
                  door-step with nothing but my own personal attractions to recommend me. However,
                  Uncle Downes was as glad to see me as if I had six dollars instead of six cents in
                  my left-hand waistcoat pocket, and hired me for the late haying on the spot, and I
                  set up a singing-school in the red school-house the next Saturday night. When the
                  haying was over, I stayed a few weeks to see what I could turn my hand to, and
                  Uncle Downes, being on the school committee, through his influence I was made
                  principal of Cole-brook Academy when the winter term began, and having a very
                  pretty set of girls to teach, I made myself and my services so acceptable to
                  parents and guardians, that I hold the place to this day, three years from
                  then.</p>
               <p>One day last spring, I sat on the stoop of Uncle Downes's house, thinking of
                  nothing in a very resolute way, with discursive seasons of listening to a brown
                  thrush that was hid in some neighboring tree, thence giving out all manner of
                  comic illustrations of every other bird's musical powers; hitting off, with gay
                  sarcasm, the robin, oriole, and whip-poorwill; even giving the faint peep of a
                  dew-wet chicken lost in the grass, the warning cry of a hawk, or the lovelorn
                  trill of a song-sparrow, with here and there a pewit, a blackbird, or the liquid
                  frolic of a bobolink's song, mimicked, exaggerated, and interspersed with his own
                  delirious warble, full of spring and its sweet exultation. I was lapsing out of
                  the thrush's concert into nothingness again, when a quick, light patter, like a
                  hail-storm coming down-stairs, woke me up, and at my elbow stood the lithe shape
                  of Lizzy Downes, my special cousin, and a peculiar little bit of womanhood as one
                  might see in a lifetime. "Get tip, Tom!" quoth the green sun-bonnet. "I want you
                  to take a walk with me." I was rather in a quietist state just then, but who ever
                  thought of resisting that clear voice, with such a decisive tone and flawless
                  ring?</p>
               <p>"Where are you going, Lizzy?" said I, after we had traveled silently and swiftly,
                  like people in fairy stories, half through Uncle Downes's farm. "Oh!" said she,
                  recollecting herself, or rather me, "I'm going to Asa Burt's lot, after some
                  columbine plants, and you may<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7187-00000158"/> carry the
                  basket." "Gracious princess!" retorted I, "accept my devoirs, and put your foot
                  upon my neck, if it pleases you." "It doesn't," said the princess; "I only want
                  you to behave like a man, and not wait next time for a lady's request, before you
                  offer to help her." At this I whistled slightly, and rubbed my hands; Lizzy had a
                  way of speaking truth that was—well—plain! but she knew it, and turned her rosy
                  face round to me with the divinest smile of intelligence and sweetness. "Don't
                  mind it, Tom; it is all for your good, and you can't get angry with me, you know."
                  Of course I couldn't; such a face as that was talismanic; besides she was my
                  cousin; and it is a singular fact in the natural history of man, that though there
                  are no people on earth one gets so entirely and utterly disgusted and out of
                  temper with as disagreeable and intrusive cousins, it is yet quite out of the
                  nature of things to be disturbed by a young, pretty, smiling cousin, however
                  saucy. It demonstrates most convincingly the old Scotch proverb, "Bluid's thicker
                  than water." All the affinities of ancestry, all the tender associations of
                  childhood, all the nameless sympathies that are only existent between relatives,
                  spring up to harmonize cousins; and our blood beats more warmly towards its
                  severed tide in the pulse of a relation—except, as I said before, the disagreeable
                  ones. So I not only refrained from getting vexed at Lizzy's reproof, but submitted
                  with sweet humility, and would have kissed the rod had it been permitted or
                  required.</p>
               <p>"Do you hear that thrush, Tom?" broke in the lady, upon my meditation. "Yes,
                  ma'am, I have been listening to it this hour, from the east stoop." "What a lazy
                  creature you are! spending a whole hour in mortal idleness, this lovely day." "Not
                  a bit of it, mademoiselle; my meditations in that stoop were of the most useful
                  character; nothing less than a skilful analysis (mental, of course), of the
                  vibratory power of air, and its probable capabilities in mechanics." "Oh! Tom,
                  Tom! can't you let schoolmastering alone, on Saturdays? and such a celestial
                  Saturday as this; look there, if you want a better meditation than your
                  analyses."</p>
               <p>I did look up through the dim, gray branches of the wood we were skirting, and
                  there, on the leafless bough of a tall hickory-tree, sat two wild pigeons, eying
                  us with soft, shy glances, stooping their graceful, shining necks, and drawing
                  them up again, with a native pride not unlike that of my companion, though I
                  acquit her of being anything dove-like! A few steps on the dead leaves startled
                  the pretty creatures from their perch, the dull blue plumes shot suddenly into
                  white, and black, and gray, and slowly they lit, some few rods off, on a fir-tree,
                  while we went on our way.</p>
               <p>"Do you know, Tom," said Lizzy, "I have a theory about birds, and people. I think
                  every one is like some bird. Could you guess, now, who a wood-pigeon always makes
                  me think of?" "I know who has that same way of drawing up her head, Miss Lizzy; no
                  other than your fair self." "Nonsense! I am no more like that pigeon than I am
                  like a turkey; nor as much, for I can gobble inimitably, to the intense rage of
                  all the turkeys in our barn-yard. No, indeed; I am much more like an oriole; look
                  at that one, how it dashes aslant the elm boughs, and makes a descent into the
                  hollow below, like a flake of fire; that's the way I drop into our stupid
                  sewing-societies here, and make the old ladies' hair stand on end with my
                  absurdities. No! if you do not recognize our Colebrook wood-pigeon, I shall not
                  help you." "Then I shall never know," rejoined I, in a tone of mock lamentation.
                  "Oh! yes, you'll discover for yourself, some time," laughed Lizzy, quietly
                  climbing a fence between the home-farm<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7187-00000159"/>
                  and Uncle Asa's lot. "Why, Lizzy, you are too quick! I was just offering to help
                  you, and you are over." "I never will have any help, sir, over a fence; what is
                  the use of being a country girl, if you cannot cross a fence without help?" "Not
                  much, indeed, in this New England, where every acre field is fenced; but, Lizzy,
                  look! here are columbines enough for you."</p>
               <p>As I spoke, we had reached the centre of the little meadow through which crept a
                  slow, bright stream, keeping the grass about it greener than the sea, and set
                  thick with blue violets and golden cowslips; while on the drier banks of moss and
                  turf that skirted the marshy borders of the brook, hundreds of sunny
                  adders'-tongues flaunted their yellow turbans, all dropped with garnet, in the
                  spring-winds, and still further back, among budded lupines and sweet fern, myriads
                  of anemones, fair and frail, bent languidly to the warm breath of the south,
                  seeming just ready, so aerial were their shapes, to take flight from their rest
                  upon earth. On the inner edge of the meadow a great gray rock abutted from the
                  hill-side right on to the greensward; about its base clustered a quaint crowd of
                  brown-flowered trilliums, and the delicate straw-bells of May—while on its ledges,
                  from every crack and shelf where a grain of earth could harbor, sprung innumerable
                  columbines of the brightest scarlet and gold, swaying, and dancing, and tossing
                  their jewelled heads like veritable fairy princesses, so full of laughter and
                  delight, that you waited involuntarily to hear the gay peal of musical mirth from
                  their tiny bells, and fancied, on each new sigh of the fragrant air, a far-off
                  echo from their tinkling in some distant field. Here my task began, and in a few
                  minutes Lizzy's basket was filled to the brim with roots, and her hands with the
                  blossoms—fit representatives of her gay, brilliant, graceful self, as she stood
                  poised on a ledge of the rock—her sun-bonnet hanging by one string, her face
                  burning with the warm flush of youth and health, her blue eyes glowing deeply in
                  the sunlight, and her soft chestnut hair coiling in lustrous rings about her
                  throat, lifted by the light wind, and melted to living gold wherever a sunbeam
                  kissed it.</p>
               <p>I know I stood there with mouth and eyes wide open, like the sun-struck fool I
                  was, "glowering" at Lizzy, who must have had some idea of my condition, for
                  suddenly she began to descend the rock with free, firm steps, like a chamois (at
                  least, I suppose so, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">vide</foreign> Buffon), and I
                  remembered afterwards, as one does remember things seen and not perceived, that
                  there was a furtive smile glittering in the corners of her eyes. As for me, I was
                  altogether in a maze, for the idea had suddenly taken possession of me that I was
                  in love, actually, in good earnest, in love with my cousin Lizzy! Everything I had
                  the presence of mind to recollect, favored that idea. Did I not obey her like a
                  bond-slave? was I not always so lonely at Uncle Downes's when she went away? I
                  admired her beauty more than that of any other woman. I admired her mind in its
                  active, earnest, and noble development.</p>
               <p>Her character had faults, to be sure—a need of some small feminine virtues—but
                  love would teach her those. Ah! <emph>did</emph> she love me? "Tom! are you
                  asleep?" pealed from the lips of which I had been dreaming. "N—o, Lizzy, I was
                  thinking." "Come a few steps further, then, and I will find you a better place to
                  think, for if you had eyes to see, there is a hornet's nest visible about a foot
                  from your head, in that maple sapling, and you are in what the newspapers call a
                  precarious situation." "So I am!" thought I to myself, adding aloud, "I am bound
                  to follow you, mademoiselle; only lead me."</p>
               <p>A brief walk over the green field brought us to its upper<pb n="318-319"
                     xml:id="VAC7187-00000160"/> corner, where the brook leaped and chattered over a
                  stony bed, before it sung itself to sleep in the silent channel below. Over this
                  little nook stood two great apple-trees, rosy with bloom, filling the air with
                  their delicate and peculiar odor, and all murmurous with honey-bees, whose loving
                  labor-song only heightened the cool silence of the shadow and the perfume; while
                  the little brook's laugh toned itself to a bobolink's voice, that echoed its mad
                  mirth back again from the nearest fence-post. "Sit down," said my liege lady; "it
                  is too pleasant here not to be enjoyed."</p>
               <p>I seated myself on the turf, still in a dream, while Lizzy bathed her hands and
                  face in the cool water, and anchored her flowers to a stone on the edge of the
                  stream to keep them from fading. She came back to me looking as fresh and lovely
                  as the spray of pink apple-blossoms she held in her hand, and, seating herself
                  beside me, began to talk about them. Her entirely unembarrassed air gave me a sort
                  of shiver, but I listened. "Aren't these blossoms very pretty, Tom? There is
                  something specially fascinating to me about 'apple-blows,' as Uncle Asa calls
                  them; they are so refined, so gracious, so home-like; withal softly and warmly
                  tinted, and of such delicate scent, a little bitterness about it; just enough to
                  make it piquant, not insipid; a sort of common-sense, do you understand? And then
                  they are so full of promise for future winter firesides; I have a vision of a
                  whole cider-barrel and ten apple-pies in the very cluster I hold! but really, I am
                  serious about their beauty and expression; my flowers will do well to mate the
                  wild pigeons, won't they?"</p>
               <p>As she spoke, an oriole flashed across the meadow, and her own comparison for
                  herself made a like flash across my thoughts; how beautiful, how piquant she was!
                  and oh! Thomas Petition Stevens, what a fool you were! dyed in the grain! I
                  lumbered on to my knees before her, I don't remember how, and without one word of
                  warning gasped out:—"Oh, Lizzy! I love you to distraction, can't you love me?"</p>
               <p>Her face was absolutely pale with surprise, then a wild and flitting fear swept
                  over it; I could see she thought me suddenly crazy, and the hot tears began to
                  fill my eyes, man that I was! I suppose she saw, then, I was in earnest; for she
                  blushed most beautifully, then bent her face down in both her little hands, and
                  began—oh reader! pity me!—actually to laugh:—laugh till the red blush spread to
                  the very parting of her hair, colored the slender throat, the small ear, and at
                  length the white fingers. It was too much; I could not bear it; I became a man
                  again, and something very like a thrill of anger brought me to my feet. At this
                  Lizzy looked up, her eyes full of tears from long laughing, and her face radiant
                  with dimpling mirth, and yet a sweet shadow of pity and surprise upon it. She held
                  out her hand to me—how could I help taking it? or sitting quietly down beside her,
                  very much in the state of a water-cure patient after his first douche? "Dear Tom,"
                  she said, in the gentlest, laughter-wearied voice, "do forgive me, but really I
                  could not help it; what does ail you this morning?" "Nothing but what I just told
                  you," said I, in a sulky-dignified manner, that was too much for Lizzy's
                  seriousness; a little shock of laughter shook her again, and brought out new
                  tears, which she wiped away soberly, and clasping her hands over the handkerchief
                  looked round at me with a grave face, through which the comic air still flickered,
                  and discomposed me. "Tom, you are very queer; I cannot believe you really thought
                  you were in earnest!" "But I was," said I, having by this time become disposed to
                     high<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC7187-00000161"/> tragedy; "I love you
                  desperately, devotedly, and if you choose to laugh at the life-long misery of a
                  fellow-being I can only hope you may never know by experience how to sympathize
                  with such misery!" Poor Lizzy! she had to bite her scarlet lips full a minute
                  before she could speak—"Really, Tom, I do not think you know either me or
                  yourself, or you would not have fancied what you seem to have. May I ask how long
                  you have been in this desperate state?" Oh, the little wicked witch! that question
                  was uttered in the simplest, gravest tone, but I felt the satire to its full
                  extent. I grew—all-over-ish—no other phrase expresses it "Why—!" said I, "I did
                  not know it, certainly, till this morning, but I have felt it, unconsciously, this
                  long time." "Tom, Tom, don't be metaphysically absurd! if you must be absurd, keep
                  this side of terms. Now I can tell you something that you <emph>have</emph> been
                  'feeling unconsciously this longtime,'—you not only do not love me but you do love
                  somebody else!" I drew a long breath. "Be so good as to explain?" "I mean to,"
                  replied Lizzy; "only turn round so I can see you, for I must catechize a little; I
                  never can harangue without interludes for ten minutes together. First, I am to
                  prove you don't love me. You admire me, I dare say, but that is nothing, not even
                  the first step, for you would admire a prettier picture more. When I first knew
                  you, you did not like me; your instincts rebelled against my character; I saw it
                  before I had known you a month; is it not so?" "Do you think that is fair, Lizzy?
                  I did not know you then—I could not judge." "That is not my answer, Tom!" "Well,
                  if you will have it, I confess I felt a little—afraid of you, perhaps; not sure
                  that you might not hurt me any moment."</p>
               <p>"That will pass, and you may answer my next question to yourself, whether those
                  very instincts have ever ceased to keep a witness among them against me, or my
                  nature as you see it. If I had loved you, I should have lost all these traits
                  towards you; I should have ceased to rule, to criticise, to condemn."</p>
               <p>An idea struck me at that moment, and I did not look at Lizzy, but I felt her
                  voice was not quite steady when she began again.</p>
               <p>"If you had loved me, there are a thousand ways in which I should have seen and
                  put an end to it before now. You would never have been so meek, and so easily
                  obedient. A man who loves never loses his sense of domination; if he obeys, it is
                  for beseeching and caresses, for love's sake, not because he recognizes a stronger
                  nature than his own; and you know I am stronger than you in several traits."</p>
               <p>"Amen," said I, rather satirically. "Now, don't be disagreeable, Tom, I am
                  striving for your good, as Deacon Mather says when he 'tutors' his boys. You don't
                  love me for still another reason, that you never thought of it till this morning.
                  Is that love? born of a spring day's idleness, the fickle caprice of sunshine and
                  the south wind? Nonsense! it is only an apt illustration of Dr. Watts' truism,
                  that <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"'Satan finds some mischief still,</l>
                        <l>For idle hands to do!'</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"Don't wince, for it is a fact. Honestly, now, did you ever think of making love
                  to me when you had anything else to do? I see you can't answer, and that is speech
                  enough. Besides, if you had loved me, you never would have asked me as you did;
                  you would have considered me before yourself, and led me carefully and tenderly
                  towards taking the one all-decisive step of a woman's life."</p>
               <p>I gave a long sigh; I was becoming convinced, and convinced<pb n="322-323"
                     xml:id="VAC7187-00000162"/> vinced of something Lizzy did not intend to prove.
                  "Do you acknowledge, Tom?"</p>
               <p>"Y-e-s, I suppose I must But really, Lizzy, I thought I loved you, and am not sure
                  yet."</p>
               <p>"I hope you do love me, after a moderate fashion, but you are not in love with me,
                  as I intend to prove to you in the second place, because you are in love with
                  somebody else!"</p>
               <p>"I am resigned!" said I, inwardly amused at her confident tone, and, be it
                  acknowledged, a little terrified, also; for I began, under her minute questioning,
                  to be partly conscious of—no matter what, yet.</p>
               <p>"Now, I expect you to be as honest as you have hitherto shown yourself, Tom, for I
                  am going to question more closely than before. You have had dreams—all men and
                  women have—of a home and a future; besides, I know you went not six weeks ago, to
                  look at Deacon Mather's new houses up on the hill. Yes, don't disclaim! I know it
                  was with an eye to your architectural sketches, but did not your dreams come back
                  there? Was there not a figure dimly visible at the long window, a face turning to
                  the gate expectantly, and a pair of neat and busy hands in the 'house wifeskep'?
                  Now, were they nobody's hands?"</p>
               <p>I began to feel rather restless; how came she to know what I thought?</p>
               <p>"Moreover, is there no lady among your acquaintances with whom you feel an entire
                  sense of quiet, rest, and freedom; whose entrance into ever so stiff and cold a
                  room gives it a kindly aspect, like the sudden lighting of a wood-fire? No one of
                  whom you think when you are tired, or sad, as a comforting and soothing presence;
                  no eyes to which you turn for sympathy in the expression of thought or feeling,
                  and always find it; no hands from which you expect and receive the thousand
                  nameless acts of forethought and consideration that only love prompts?"</p>
               <p>I had thought to some purpose, and was half convicted, but not fully enough to say
                  so. "Go on Lizzy! I like to hear you," said I, affecting an incredulous laugh.</p>
               <p>"You are not honest," replied my catechist; "your laugh was in a false key; it
                  betrays you; but I will go on. Is there not one person whom you feel a constant
                  wish to shelter from all the hardness of life, to protect, to guard, to
                  strengthen? whose image connects itself in some way with every aspect of the
                  future, without whose ever-recurring idea neither present nor future enter into
                  your imagining? in whom you unconsciously hope? Moreover, is there no one whom
                  your heart tells you with undeniable instinct, loves you as a man should be
                  loved—with entire devotion and pure tenderness, a patient faith and a sorrowful
                  constancy, that you rely on without acknowledging it? Do you not trust her as you
                  did your mother? Is she not a part of yourself so truly, that, till some sudden
                  light should awaken you, you could not perceive you loved her? Are not her soft,
                  dark eyes—"</p>
               <p>"They're not dark! they are gray." Now Lizzy laughed indeed, and I too. The sly
                  girl! I was quite in her power.</p>
               <p>"My dear Tom, do you suppose I have not known this three months that you were very
                  quietly sliding (not falling) in love with Helen Stanton? Of course I saw it, and
                  so did half the village. As for your exploit this morning, I think I have fully
                  accounted for that; and now, having shown you to yourself, and brought you to
                  confession, do you forgive my laughter? I own it was all unkind, but how could I
                  help it?"</p>
               <p>"I don't need to forgive you, Lizzy," said I. "You have done me a great service. I
                  wonder at myself."</p>
               <pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC7187-00000163"/>
               <p>"Don't wonder, but act, Tom. I had no authority to say what I did about Helen's
                  liking you, but my own observation, and I am by no means infallible. I shall not
                  laugh if she rejects you, I assure you."</p>
               <p>This suggestion made me thoroughly unquiet, I could no longer repress an
                  impertinence I had been trying to utter for the last fifteen minutes. "We shall
                  see," said I, assuming a miserable caricature of confidence. "And, by the way,
                  Lizzy, how came you to be so well read in the statistics of the tender passion, as
                  you have shown yourself?" I accompanied the question with a malicious stare at
                  Lizzy, whose face was instantly double-dyed with crimson, and her hands working
                  relentless destruction with the bough of apple-blossoms.</p>
               <p>"Why—to be honest—I don't—oh! I meant Helen, by the wild pigeon, Tom."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I know you did; but I am not to be blinded by that flash of the oriole.
                  Where did your knowledge come from, Lizzy?"</p>
               <p>"Oh!—you see—dear me! how silly I am! Tom, I am going to be married to George
                  Stanton, and that is what I brought you out here to tell you, and then wasted two
                  mortal hours telling you that <emph>you</emph> were in love with his sister! It is
                  too absurd!"</p>
               <p>Lizzy's word's came like rockets, and her face drooped in her hands, as she
                  finished—no—in one hand, for I had taken the other, and absolutely was kissing it,
                  I was so very glad. George Stanton was the finest fellow in the county, fully
                  worthy of Lizzy, had just finished his theological course, and was to be installed
                  in Colebrook next month. It was exactly the best thing, and, as soon as I found
                  words, I told her so, adding, somewhat ruefully: "I hardly expected to be
                  congratulating you on this subject, two hours ago; but I am sincerely glad,
                  Lizzy."</p>
               <p>She looked up, with a little, sweet laugh, and thanked me; so, rising from the
                  turf, we gathered up the basket and the columbines, and threaded our way homeward
                  through the woods, silently enough.</p>
               <p>That night I went down to Mr. Stanton's and persuaded Helen to go to
                  singing-school with me. I don't know if they had the class without the master, or
                  not. I never asked; for, instead of being in the red school-house, Helen and I
                  were sitting on a pine log, by the edge of the river, in the moonlight; and, after
                  a great many devices of speech, I had at last managed to ask her the same question
                  I put to Lizzy in the morning, only in rather a different way, and much more
                  uneasily.</p>
               <p>She, too, hid her face, but tears came dropping through the slender fingers; and
                  she did not forbid me to take away the hands, or dry the tears, but looked up at
                  me with her clear eyes, so full of unutterable love, that they seemed to have
                  grown blue, instead of gray, and said, softly: "I wonder what I have ever done, to
                  be made so happy!" Well for me that I felt, with no slight heartache, what the
                  tender humility of her speech implied, though she did not know it herself. If I
                  could not now efface the past, I would try faithfully to make her future
                  blessed.</p>
               <p>We were married last autumn. First old Father Mather married George and Lizzy;
                  then George did the same kind office for Helen and me. My wild pigeon still keeps
                  that name; and Lizzy and I have once in a while a little clash that Helen cannot
                  understand. Only yesterday, when I asked Mrs. Stanton to admire the comfortable
                  arrangements of my new house (one of Deacon Mather's), she informed me she "could
                  not sympathize with the life-long misery of a fellow-creature!" I had to laugh, in
                  spite of myself.</p>
               <p>That, patient reader, is the way I came to be married.</p>
