Cloth, uniform binding, Library style.  50 ts. Paper. The success which has attended the publication of the two first numbers of "Putnam's Story Libraw," vi. "The Modern Story-Teloer" and LL The Baked Head," warrants the continuation of the eries. The third number, entitled ' Stories for Christmas and Winter Evenings," although of a somewhat different character from the preceding volumes, will not be found inferior in interest.  The design of these Publications is to present to the public, in a form suitable for amusing and attractive reading, and for permanent library use, the best selections from the standard story literature of the English language. A good story is'always acceptable to all classes of readers, and this collection, we think, will be welcomed, as supplying a deficiency which now exists in most libraries.

THEY will be here soon, I should think," said the youngest of three sisters, who were gathered close round the fire, in the well furnished drawing-room of one of the principal houses in the suburbs of Brankleigh, a large manufacturing town in the north of England. "How odd it will feel," said the second sister, " to call her 'mamma ;' a girl no older than one's-self! But I shall never think of doing it; will you, Carry?" "Just like you, Jane, to have such an idea at all. Of course, we shall at first call her ' Mrs. Sellers ;' and, if she should turn out tolerably agreeable on further acquaint- ance, we may even get so far as her Christian name." "Which is, I believe, Martha. What a plain, common name! I wodld rather be called anything. But, Carry, what a strange creature she must be, if you really come to think of it, to marry a man like my father! I should as soon have dreamed of marrying old West, the apothecary. If she had been a woman of forty, I should not have won- dered, or even a very poor person; but for a girl of three- and-twenty, and an heiress --"  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7943-00000004"/> 8         clristlas S oriet. The young lady's wonderment was interrupted by the sound of carriage-wheels and a bustle at the outer gate; and the three sisters ran to the windows, to have the first glimpse of the bride. The morning had been intensely cold, and now large flakes of snow were gently falling. The windows in which the young ladies stationed themselves commanded a view of what was called by courtesy the lawn. At the end of, this, and nearly opposite the hall-door, were the large, green, palisaded gates, opening on to a carriage-drive that ran round the lawn, and was somewhat disproportioned to the size of the grounds. The carriage came slowly on, crunching beneath its wheels the dead leaves that had  fallen during the morning. The sisters caught sight of a straw bonnet, trimmed with rose-colored ribbons; and in another moment the carriage stopped, and a good-looking man of about fifty descended from it. He took out a few  ! packages, and then offered his hand to the lady within. The sisters had by this time reached the hall steps, just in time to be introduced to the wearer of the straw bonnet, "What do you think of her?" said Jane to Carry, when, having left Isabella with the bride, they retired to their own apartment, to dress for dinner. "I can scarcely tell. She appears to be very plainly dressed, and is just one of those who are neither one thing nor another in appearance; neither plain nor handsome, tall nor short, dark nor light. I hope she is not a quiz: I am inclined to think so, from her being dressed so very plainly for a bride; and a woman with a handsome fortune, too." "Well, we shall see. Here comes Bella." Numerous were the questions asked of Isabella, and very unsatisfactory were her replies. In fat, it became evident that their father's young wife was not to be under- stood upon one interview. " e."'   Ste 6ttstno$ grie.        9 "I like her, too," said Isabella. "I think she is very kind; and I fancy she can look pretty. But she is rather tired with her long journey; and' in the plain dark-green alpaca in which she travelled-- 5" "Oh! that was alpaca, was it? I did not notice. Only fancy, alpaca for a bride!" - The dinner-bell rang. " Oh, dear! Carry, just clasp my bracelet. I had no idea it was so late; and here we have been chattering. Papa will be so angry."  But papa was not angry at all. He was seated by the drawing-room fire, talking to his young wife; who had placed herself on a low ottoman by his side, and was look- ing up into his face with such an expression of loving confi- dence, that the sisters were quite struck by it. "How odd!" they whispered to each other, as they pro- ceeded to the dining-room; "she really loves him then." So possessed were they by this novel idea, that they for- got to remark her dress, which would at another time have claimed all their attention. She was attired in a rich black satin, made as plainly as possible. There was not a single ornament of any kind; save-a little trimming of good lace; yet it well became the youthful bride, whose appearance was striking, from its very simplicity. The second Mrs. Sellers was evidently a character, and that of no ordinary kind. Calm and self-possessed in man- ner, her high, wide forehead presented a splendid study for a phrenologist. She had clear, dark eyes, that looked the very mirror of innocence and trusting affection; but there was a depth in them, a depth inscrutable to ordinary observ- ers, which concealed a truly masculine energy of thought and feeling.' Her peculiarities, however, as evinced by her conversation and daily course of proceeding, will be best developed in the progress of our tale.

"How cold it is!" said Mr. Sellers, as, the dinner hav- ing been removed, and the wine and dessert placed on the table, the party of five drew their chairs round the fire. - "How cold it is!" he repeated, rubbing his hands over the cheerful blaze. "Shall I prepare you some walnuts?" asked his youth- ful wife, placing herself next him, and smiling in his face with that devoted look of hers. "My dear, you are very kind." "Papa," said Isabella, " when will it be Christmas-day?" "Can't you calculate, my love? To-day is the 13th. It will be on the-let me sec " "On Thursday week, papa," said Jane. "I like it best to occur on Thursday. It is several years since it fell on that day." The subject seemed to annoy Mr. Sellers. As Jane pro- ceeded in her speech, his brow darkened, and he turned away, and hastily drank off a bumper of port. His wife looked up at him with a glance of anxious inquiry. "Thursday!" continued- the unconscious Jane, who was singularly devoid of tact and perception. "Where were we living when Christmas-day was on a Thursday? I must have been quite a child." "Jane, can't you hold your chattering tongue?" whis- pered her elder sister, angrily. Mrs. Sellers sat with downcast eyes. She felt that she was treading on unknown ground. Jane looked offended, and her sisters uncomfortable; while their father preserved an absolute silence. A few seemingly insignificant words had destroyed the harmony of the party. But the young bride was full of benevolence; so she resumed her prepa- ration of the walnuts, and asked her husband to pour out. half a glass of sherry. "Did you ever hear," she asked, in her peculiarly win-   t1e Slitm  nxle.       " ning voice " o'f the practice of soaking walnuts in sherry? See, I have filled the glass. Taste how good they are." Her husband smiled kindly upon her, and took the glass. The girls lifted their drooping heads, and the con- versation resumed its usual tone; but- no further mention was made of the unfortunate Christmas Thursday. "I wonder," said Caroline, as she took off'a magnificent amethyst and emerald brooch, in her dressing-room that evening--, I wonder why the new Mrs. Sellers wears no ornaments. Did you ever see a bride dressed so plainly? She must have some ornaments. We will make her show us her jewel-box.,  "She is a kind creature," said Isabella. "How fond my father appears to be of her! His face is quite altered when he looks at her. Do you know, I really think I shall give over calling her so formally, ' Mrs. Sellers!, "But then, Martha!, I can never manage the ' Mar- tha," said Carry. "And as to saying 'mamma, it is quite ridiculous; such a simple-looking body, with no wo- manly airs about her., tShe will wonder,, said Jane, "what we meant about Thursday and Christmas-day. You pinched my arm   so Carry, that I am sure it is black and blue. Yes; see the marks of your thumb and finger. How should I remember that poor dear sister , "Hush'! Jane; I can't bear to hear about it. My fa. ther has been a different man ever since. You and Isabella were too young to know all the sorrows of that dreadful time. I believe it killed mamma." In how many families is there some sorrowful mystery some fault committed by a once beloved and esteemedl member of the household, and over which is cast the veil of silence, moistened with the secret tears of vain regret!

Our readers must proceed with us along one of the old- est and filthiest streets of Brankleigh; where the rumble of carts passing along from the coal-staiths and corn and iron warehouses, added to the uncouth cries of the dirty children playing about in the mud, and the oaths and lound talking of the brutalized men who pursued their several callings in the midst of the smoke and impure smells of the place, formed by no means a fitting atmosphere for one who had to gain her hard-earned bread by the labors of her pen. Yet there she sat, in the close, confined room of a small lodging, leaning her head upon her hand, and endeavoring to elaborate from her confused brain a short tale for one of the periodicals. "Mary, dearest," called a faint voice from an adjoining bedroom. The authoress obeyed the call, with a sigh, which she smothered as she drew near the bed of the invalid. "What is it, dear?" she asked, in her most cheerful tone, as she gently drew back the curtain, and leaned over the bed. "I think, Mary, I shall be able to get up. I feel a little stronger this afternoon, sweet wife." "Thank God for it, darling. But take care you are not exerting yourself too soon." The sufferer raised himself in the bed. "Feel," he said, i' how much better my Ipulse is." She took his emaciated wrist between her fingers, and counted its feeble'throbbings. "Yes, it is improved. Fuller, and not so intermitting. How pleased Mr. Fairlegh will be to find you so much better!"   i4 Gt-6tCtmaa HA.        13S "Bythe by, Mary, where is the paper he brought me yesterday?" "Here, love, in the closet. I put it out of your way until it was proper for you to read it." "' Have you looked at it? Any particular news?" "No, I have been too busy. Dearden, the editor of the Lady's Scrap-Book, you know, wrote to me to send him an article on a particular subject; so I set to at once, and have been busy at it until now." "Well, that is good news, at any rate. Now, darling, help me to dress." The invalid was speedily attired in his old blue dressing- gown, and laid on the little hard sofa in the sitting-room. "The room feels close," he said. "Have you had the window open to-day?" "No, dear. The carts make such a noise; and, besides, though I don't know where it comes from, there is a most dis- agreeable smell. I just put my head out early this morning, and it made me quite sick. So I closed the window again, and here I have been writing-writing-all the day, even while you enjoyed that sweet slumber which has so revived you. No wonder you feel the room close. I will set the door open, if you don't mind that crying child in the oppo- site chamber." "No, never mind. Let us have tea; and sit by me on the sofa, my dearest. While you make tea, I will have a look at the paper." So Mary gave her husband the paper, and set handily about her business of preparing tea. She put two little spoonfuls of congou in the pot, with a pinch of carbonate of soda, to make it draw. Then, going to the old m'a- hogany sideboard, she took-from one of the deep drawers at the side a small pot of marmalade, a little loaf, and some sugar and butter.

Just as the delicate-looking little woman seated herself upon the sofa, as her husband had requested, and proceeded to pour out the tea, she was startled by a violent exclama- tion; and, looking anxiously at him, perceived his emaci- ated face all in a glow. "What is the matter, dear Henry?" she said. "What affects you so much?" "Something that concerns you, Mary, much more nearly than myself. Who would have believed it? What strange things do happen, to be sure! I wonder what your sisters will say to it." "Give me the paper, dear, and let me see this wonder- ful news for myself. You are far too excitable, Henry. Where is the place? Do show me." "There, little woman. Who is excitable now?" Mary looked fondly in her husband's face, and took his long, thin fingers within her own, while she read:- "' On the 12th instant, at St. James's Church, Cotterell, by the Rev. Walter Thomas,   .' Why, Henry, this is never my father who has been getting married again! It must be a hoax. My poor dear mother! Surely he would never wish to replace her!" "The 12th instant," musingly remarked the husband. "The 12th ;--what is to-day, love?" "Wednesday was the 10th. It is the 13th. There must be some mistake. Why! the paper is nearly a month old, and we have been reading it for a new one. How out of the world we are!" "Out of every world but your literary one, my dear. I can't imagine how Fairlegh could make such a mistake as to bring me such an old paper." "This cannot be a hoax, either," said Mary, restuming   Ge C(!mtmas brib.        its the topic of the marriage. "And yet my father is the last man in the world whom I should have expected to take such a step. I wonder whether she is young or old. A little more marmalade, dearest?, "While we are wondering," said Henry, smiling "we might as well just think where our Christmas-dinner is to come from." "Ah+! I have not thought of that yet," said Mary; "Christmas-day is-when?,   . "On Thursday week. We have hitherto managed to keep Christmas in some fashion; and, though matters are worse with us now than ever before , "We will have a Christmas-pudding, wont we, love,. though we pinch a little for it? Well, we will see; there are twelve days yet. How I should like a peep at the second Mrs. Sellers!  Bah! the word does not seem natural. I never will call her ' mother,' whatever age she nlay be." "Now, I consider that unkind of my little wife. Sup- pose she' should turn out a very angel, a 'Christmas angel?' , "Nonsense, Henry. Do you suppose that anv one could equal my own dear mother?," Mary wiped a tear from her eye, and rose to clear away the tea-things, and revive the scanty fire, which had sunk down to a few red ashes. She then went to the window, I and stood for a few minutes observing the shivering pas- sengers below, who hurried along in the lamp-light; hats, bonnets, and shoulders whitened with the snow that fell in huge flakes, but melted immediately on the trampled mud of the pavement, moist with the rain of the previous day.  "Here comes Mr. Fairlegh at last," she exclaimed. "How thankful you ought to be, Henry, for such a friend  He!lever fils you, hail, rain, or snow. Poor man! it is a  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7943-00000008"/> 1T6        rir6naiw  torzek, pity he has not plenty of money. He would know how to turn it to good account." "Ah! wife, thou art mercenary, I fear." "No: I only meant" the door opened, and in came a tall, well built, gentleman- ly-looking man, with a huge head of curly black hair, sprin- kled with grey, which he had the habit of holding down, as if immersed in the abstraction of deep reflection. When he raised his remarkable head, and looked straight at you with his thoughtful- black eyes, shining from under prominent and shaggy brows, it needed a most perfect candor and rectitude of intention to meet that scrutiny unblenched; for you felt that there stood a man whose perception pene- trated all disguises and pettinesses of feeling, and who pos- sessed, besides, a stern sense of justice that was ready to expose and annihilate everything that was not genuine. With the false and hypocritical he was a very Joab; but innocence and confident integrity experienced an indescrib- able sense of protection in his benevolent presence, and were drawn towards him, as by an irresistible attraction. Children and dogs always ran to claim acquaintance with Andrew Fairlegh; and children and dogs generally know pretty well what they are about in matters of affection. This man, such as we describe him, walked into the little parlor where Henry Drummond was still lying ex- tended on the sofa, and advancing towards the fire, shook himself like 'a huge dog. Then laying aside his shaggy greatcoat, and a massive stick that he always carried, and  which was so like him in general appearance that his friends considered it quite a part of him, he first took Mary's hand with a kindly greeting, and then setting himself beside the invalid, entered into an examination of his condition.

Why he- was so bitter about it, nobody knows; or he had never, to any one's knowledge, experienced the annoyance of that state himself. "You don't intend to set to work again, do you?" he asked, as Mary bl ought a quire of foolscap to the table, and, dipping her pen in the inkstand, began to write. "Oh, yes! indeed I do," she answered. "Business will not wait.', Then why do you sit in that position, with a side light? Have I not often told you that you will hurt those spark- ling eyes of yours by such p rceedings? By the by, I had nearly forgotten. Here is a parcel of the brown candles I told you of, that give such a brilliant light., And he went to his overcoat, and pulled an immense packet out of the front pocket. "And hel e, too," said he, producing a small p ot wrapped in blue paper " is some more of that marma- lade you told nle you liked, Henry, my good boy. Take care you are always equally candid in stating your fancies." "Thank you; but you are really too kind , "Too kind! W  hat do you mean? Can anyone be too kind? Is any one too kind? If Christ were to come upon the earth again, would he find one in a thousand anything like the good Samaritan ? Answer me that. The argument was incontroyertible. HenryDrummond was obliged to, resign himself, as he had done a hundred tines before, to the disinterested bounties of his friend. "Come,' said the latter; after he had sat about anhour,  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7943-00000009"/> 18        d6npman Starins. and they-had thoroughly discussed the topic of Mr. Sellers's marriage, but in a low tone, not to disturb the pale, youbng authoress--" come, Mrs. Drummond, get your husband to bed, and I will take myself off. He has talked long enough tor that excitable head of his." So Andrew Fairlegh took his departure; and Mary, hav- ing seen her husband safe in bed, returned to her quire of foolscap, and- sat late into the night, spinning out her brains into a rich and fanciful web, for-the amusement, and possibly instruction, of the fair readers of "' The Lady's Scrap-Book." It was Sunday morning; and, according to time-honored custom, the bride ought to make her appearance at church in all her wedding finery. The young ladies at Beech- House had duly prepared themselves and their toilets for the important occasion. "Now," said Jane to Carry, as they stood arranging their hair before the cheval-glasses in their dressing-room, while a comfortable fire burned in the grate, and took off the chill of the foggy morning--llnw we shall see our young mamma like a bride at last. Hark! there is the breakfast bell. -How do I look, Carry?" "Very well, indeed. I don't think we shall make by any means a despicable appearance. DonIt you wish we had a maid?" "Perhaps papa will let us have one now. Come, let us go to breakfast." Down to breakfast they all went, in their beautiful amber satins. Mr. and MrS. Sellers speedily followed; and the surprise of the three sisters may be imagined when the plain black satin again met their eyes. "Then you are not going to appear at church this morn- ing, papa," said Carry, as Mr. Sellers commenced cutting the cold boiled ham into '"Vauxhalls."   ^e (itewm Arid.        19 "Why do you think so, my dear?", inquired he, uncon- sciously, proceeding to put a delicate slice into each of their plates. "Because- because , i Because I am not in fitting attire?" inquiredthe bride, smiling archly. "Yes," answered Caroline, smiling also, and at the same time blushing a little. "Your father and I are certainly going to church, but we do not see why we should make afuss about it. We go just as we should on any other Sundav. The house of God is not a show-room.', "Then you don't mean to sit for company?, "No, my love," replied Mr. Sellers ; "Martha and I have agreed to dispense with all such foolish and useless ceremo- nies. Those ofour friends who know that we have returned, and wish to keep up our acquaintance, will call, just as they would at any- other time. We shall always be happy to see them., Caroline and Jane were much disappointed by this deci- sion. They had anticipated all the glory of sitting in state, which was rigidly kept up in Brankleigh; the chocolate and bridecake, the room full of elaborately dressed ladies and gentlemen, and the blushes of the bride and her satellites, looking their very best for the occasion. What an oppor- tunity for touching the heart of young Somerville, who would be sure to escort his sisters; or of rich M r. Wood- houselee, the banker-and all lost! What possible good was a wedding in the family, without all the proper accom - paniments? Jane and Carry inwardly vowed, that if they had ever the good luck to be married, they would have. nsomething like a wedding. Not so with Isabella. Younger by some yearsthan her sisters, and more simple-minded, she was already disposed  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7943-00000010"/> 20    -I;xisma atontes to look up to the superior character of her new relation, and appreciate her intentions. Besides, she could not help admiring the perfect harmony that existed between her and her husband, and which is so rarely to be met with in that holy state, where spirit as well as 4' flesh," should be "( one." It had not been so in her own mother's lifetime. Though both Mr. Sellers and his first wife were excellent peo- ple, kindly disposed, and of high integrity, some slight differ- ences of opinion had led to petty discords, that exasperated whatever, failings of temper they possessed to a quite unnecessary degree. Isabella had been an accidental wit- ness of some of these outhreaks, and, young as she was at the time, the impression made upon her was such, that she formed a solemn determination never to marry any one whose spirit was not likely in deed and in truth to become one with her own.  To this determination she added another-viz. if she iWmet with any man whom she felt she could entirely love and respect, and he showed himself like- minded towards her, to marry him, whatever his age or station might be. Almost intuitively she had arrived at the conviction, that more misery was produced in the world by people missing their ' other halves," than by any single circumstance besides. Isabella was, however, very mild and quiet; and all this had been working in her mind quite unknown to any mem- ber of her family. So that she stood, as it were, alone; and her lonely heart requiring sympathy, as do the hearts of all of us, however strong and independent we may wish to be, she was delighted to find in her father's young wife one who was likely to give her this sympathy, unalloyed by any mixture of quizzing, or the annoying species of indulgence accorded to what some very wise people consider "ro- mance" and "absurd nonsense." With this feeling, she accompanied Mrs. Sellers up stairs after breakfast was over,   - z p tatmas UNbe.      21 and timidly asked if she might sit with her until- church- time., "Yes, dear Isabella, to be sure," answered the bride. t' Will you go with me into my dressing-room? It is there that I usually retire on a Sunday morning. Have you ever thought much about this precept," inquired Mrs. Sellers, after a pause, during which they had both been occupied in reading--"Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee, turn thou not away?', "Not much, I confess,' Isabella replied. "  One reads these things so habitually, that they fail to impress us with any definite notions." "For which reason," returned Mrs. Sellers, "I am very sparing in my reading of this kind. A few verses at a time are all that I peruse. Sometimes I put the book away for a short space; and, when I re-open it, these beautiful pre- cepts come upon me with the power and force of new ideas. Did you ever try to take them literally, and act upon them?" "No," said Isabella; "I was never tuaght to do so. In- deed, I was always told that many of them were impossible to be taken literally. Hush! there is the church bell. What do you mean to put on, mamma mine?"' "You little ,foolish girl, call me Martha at once. Why, how much older am I than you?" "I am just eighteen, and you are three-and-twenty.7" "Pray, who told you that?" "Oh! a little bird, I assure youi Mrs. Martha Sellers, such a wedding as yours does not --But I beg your par- don; I am very impertinenrt." "No, love, only innocent and candid."  And Martha kissed Isabella on her fair, open forehead. "Do let me help you to dress," said the latter. "I can do that, and have plenty of time to dress myself after.  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7943-00000011"/> 22        C ifim^ itfot Where is your bonnet?  Where do you put all your things?" 4"Here; see, I shall put on this shawl." "Have you a shawl-pin?" "No." "How do you fasten your shawl, then?"1 ( Just with a common pin; it does well enough." - May I be impertinent again?" said Isabella, blushing slightly. "Certainly; you have my full leave." "Well, then, I must say I never knew a bride like you. I have not seen you wear a brooch since you came-nor a ring. Just let me look at your hand: not that-the other. It is a nice white hand, with pretty tapering fingers; and this plain gold ring becomes it well. But you have not even a guard for it." "C It requires none: the guard is in my heart." "Then you despise all ornament?" "No, dear Isabella, it is not that. I am naturally a lover of jewels, and like to look at them upon other people. I used to have a great many, for my mamma left me all hers, and my other relations were constantly making me presents. I will some time tell you what reflections made me part with all my jewels, and resolve from that time forward to wear no- thing that was not needed for neatness and comfort. Now, my dear, make haste and get ready, or you will be too late." "What a nice green velvet! I must say that it looks more sensible than a fine bridal bonnet this foggy day." More than a week has passed since the youthful bride's appearance upon the scene of her future experience. Within that short space of time, she has uttered and done enough strange things to set one half the most " respectable" peo- ple of Brankleigh talking and wondering about her, and  .:   qt IWrima    e.        23 prophesying that "it can never last; with such opinions, she will be sure to disgrace herself in the end."  And yet they are very courteous to her face; for not only does Mr. Sellers's reputation as a thriving citizen and "safe", man uphold his wife in a certain position, but the report of her large fortune, and its settlement upon herself, has also got [wind; and who can dare gainsay the doings of a rich heiress! Mammon! with all our charities and our preach- ings, with all our aspirations after the time when a man shall be valued according to what he is, and not after the standard of what he has, when there shall be no respect of persons, and " the might with the right and the truth shall be"--with all these shadows of " the good time coming," Mammon, thou art still the god of this world;- and men bow low before thine huge golden altar, and debase and degrade the image of God in the service of his rival. So the original-minded  Martha Sellers went on her way, serenely soaring, like her prototype the moon, above the clouds of exaggeration and petty gossip, carrying her hus- band's heart along with her the while. It was the Monday morning before 'Christmas-day--a bright, clear, frosty morning-and Mr. Sellers gave his arm to his wife, for the purpose of escorting her to do what ladies call a " little shopping.", He had never been used to this kind of thing, but he did not dread entering a shop with Martha. She was not in the habit of turning over the whole contents of the shelves, and worrying the young men out of all patience, for a yard of ribbon or a little tulle. Her quick eye discerned at once what would suit her purpose; and her natural consideration for the feelings of others led her to give no more trouble than what was abso-, lutely necessary. She had even been known to hurry over a purchase, and go home but half-satisfied, when she hap- pened to find out that it was the dinner hour for the young  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7943-00000012"/> 24         ttitimis *ftoro men, and that the youth who was attending to her was very faint with a long morning's work. So we mat be sure that our bride did not keep her husband very long dangling his legs from the high narrow chairs in the several shops, but despatched her business with equal ease and rapidity, vary- ing it by affectionate appeals to his taste and judgment, which kept him a pleased spectator of her cheerful move- ments. They were just leaving the large establishment where Mrs. Sellers had ordered an unusual quantity of raisins, and candied lemon, and so forth, for her Christmas preparations, when they stumbled upon a woman who was entering it. Mrs. Sellers was looking another way, and did not particu- larly notice the person whom she thus encountered. But immediately afterwards, on asking her husband a slight question, she received no answer; and, looking up into his face for the reason of his silence, she was surprised to find that it bore the traces of strong, though suppriessed emotion. "What is the matter, dearest?" she inquired, in alarm. "Are you ill? "No-nothing, love," he stammered; and she forbore further questioning, for she saw that he did not wish it. No more was said, and he soon became as cheerful as usual. "Whom shall we have to dine with us on Christmas- day?" said Caroline, as they were sitting round the fire after dinner. CIt is almost too late to issue ther invitations now,"' re- marked Jane, discontentedly. -"We have always been in the habit of inviting a few friends for that day, Mrs.  Sellers."                          C So I understand, " quietly observed the bride. "But ;I we are in time yet. Have you any poor relations, Mr.   % Sellers, who would be glad of a good dinner of roast beef X and plum-pudding!"                    ;   7gte fmittm Oribt.       25 The young ladies looked at each other, and then at their papa. But he, after one glance into the candid, loving eyes of his young wife, answered composedly, though with a certain restraint, ,I am almlost ashamed to tell you, Martha, that I have nearly lost sight of them all. Let me see. Poor Jack Marvel, the first Mrs. Seilers's brother. An idle, dissipated sort of fellow he was, and we really could not do with him disgracing us here; so we let him know he was not very welcome, and, being as proud as he was poor, he soon made himself scarce. I have not seen him for the last six years. The last time I heard of him, he was living in one of the lowest parts of the town.)" The bride had seated herself at a small writing-table beside the fire. "What is his address, dear?" she said. "Duke's yard, Skinner street. At  least that was where he lived two years ago, when I heard a bad account of his health., "We will inquire after him," said Martha. '"The next?" "The next poor relation, love? There is old Sarah Sissons-a kind of fiftieth cousin; and Tom Sellers, another cousin. I think these are all I can mention. Only, if you are inclined to be very charitable, there is one poor old friend of mine, whom my  late wife never could bear. So just for peace ' sake, I was obliged to break with him. '  I have often repented it since. His address is John M'Far- ane, Swallow street. He is a  plain sort of man, but very sensible, though odd and abrupt in his manner. He was ;oo candid for the first Mrs. Sellers.," "Oh, I   have no doubt he and I shall suit admirably, " aid Martha, smiling. "Now for the addresses of Sarah 'issons and Tom Sellers.,  They were given her, and then she turned towards the hree sisters, who were all gazing at her with astonishment, rough in Isabella it was mingled with admiration. ug1e wiham  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7943-00000013"/>  is a nice Christmas party", , er  - Bee          , ,xpressed ".One, two, three, fo  .  inc-room.

" Sit down, Martha; I have often wished to unburden my mind to you, I am a different man since I knew you, my darling. But perhaps you would rather undress first." ' No, love, tell me now; I shall not be so sleepy. The fire is very good, and I have on my thick dressing-gown. Here, give me your hand, and tell me all about it." "Well, then," said Mr. Sellers, covering his face with his other hand, as if ashamed, "I suppose you are aware that I have another daughter, besides those whom you have seen?" "I have heard some rumors of the kind, but I did not know that she was still alive." "Yes, she is alive, and living in this town. We met her this morning." "Did we, indeed? Where, dearest?" "When we were coming out of Dawson's shop. Don't you remember stumbling over some woman?" "Yes, I was looking at those great Chinese mandarins that sit there nodding, nodding-a sort of catchpenny, I presume. I was aware that we knocked against somebody, but I did not see her face." "That somebody, Martha, was my own poor dear child. She turned as pale as a lily; and she was not dressed so well as one of my servants. Ever since I knew you, and came L   under your pure influence, I have doubted whether I acted the part of a Christian father in forbidding her my house, and disinheriting her merely because she had followed the dictates of her heart, fulfilled an understood engagement, and married a man whose only defect, even in my eyes, was want of money. I had encouraged their intimacy in better days." "You only did as most other fathers would have done,"  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7943-00000014"/> 28         rrietmaa $tories.. said Martha, soothingly. "The fault lies in the generally received ideas about the thing, not in the individual instan- ces of carrying them out. An impartial arbitrator has long been needed between parent and child, Love and Mammon.'? "Very true, my dear. I wish I had spoken to her this morning; but I had not yet made up my mind to do so, and the sight of her so altered, completely unnerved me. Now I have lost all trace of her." "We shall perhaps be able to trace her again," said Mrs. Sellers. "I daresay the grocer will know where she lives." "A bright idea. Thank you, my sweet comforter. I shall now go to sleep with a comparatively easy con- science." "Just one more question, dear. Are you sure that Mary's sisters never see her?" "No, love, I forbade all intercourse from the very first." "What a severe man thou hast been! How was it that I happened to take a fancy to you?" "Because you are an old young woman; so a young old man was not a bad match for you. Nevertheless, I am, and always shall be, grateful for your disinterested affection to a man so much older than yourself, dear girl." The1 next morning Mr. and Mrs. Sellers set out on their errand of peace and good-will. They had not said any- thing to the sisters of their intention to find out the offend- ing one, and offer her the- right hand of reconciliation, because they wished to prepare a delightful surprise for them; especially for Isabella, who had from the first been thoroughly understood and appreciated by Martha, and through her was beginning to be so by Mr. Sellers. So they allowed them to suppose that they were merely carry- ing their own invitations to Jack Marvel and the rest. The sky was without a cloud, the granite pavement of   I         f Olnstmais bribe.       2S     the streets sparkled like diamonds, and the dirtiest houses looked almost gay in the winter sunshine, that penetrated every nook of. the town of Brankleigh. But there was a keen north-eaSt wind, and the bride-folded her warm cloak closer about her as she passed over the open space in the J   - neighborhood of Skinner street. -They had called at the At   grocer's on their way, but he knew nothing of Mary. He     said that a woman answering her description called occa- sionally; but she always paid ready money, and carried ;   her small purchases away with her in a little basket, and I   that was all he could tell them. He " thought she was a !   lady-looking person, something above the common; but he had never troubled his head much about her, having enough to do to attend to his customers as they came."  So they vere obliged to depart unsatisfied, to the bitter disappoint. ment of Mr. Sellers. "It would have been a  good plan to have left a note at Dawson's," said Martha, as they entered Skinner street, and stooped under a clothes-line that stretched across it, loaded with wet linen.  "Only I fear she laid in her store of Christmas groceries yesterday, and will not call again for some time. It is a great pity. I should so have liked to invite her to dinner for Christmas-day. Do you not feel with me, dear Charles, that it is a peculiarly suitable time for healing family breaches?', "You know, Martha, how perfectly I agree with you in most things, and, above all, in your exhibitions of bene- volence. But I cannot feel that one day is better than another for performing good actions." "Nor do I mean to say so. God forbid! But I think times and seasons are requisite for many people, just to- remind them of the acts of kindness which they may have neglected to perform. The majority have not yet suffi- ciently drunk in the spirit of the gospel."  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7943-00000015"/> 30        dt maas $iori . "ook! here's Duke's yard. What a filthy entry! We shall be ankle-deep in mud." "Never mind, dear; you need not shrink on my ac- count. My boots are thick, and this stout mering gown will take no damage. My dress is never a hindrance to me." "See!" said Martha again, pointing to a man who was sitting on the door-step of a ruinous house in the corner of the yard. "How bitterly that poor fellow is weeping! Shall we speak to him?" "What is the matter with you, my friend?" inquired Mr. Sellers, going towards him, and laying a kind hand on his shoulder. The man lifted up a haggard face, that too plainly bore the traces of recent intoxication. "Bless my soul!" exclaimed Mr. Sellers. "Jack Mar- vel, is it you?" Poor Jack recognised his brother-in-law, but the recog- nition appeared to give him neither surprise nor pleasure. He coldly and distantly shook hands, and then relapsed into his fit of weeping. "Can I do anything for you, Jack?" said Mr. Sellers again. "For old acquaintance' sake, for the memory of your poor sister, my late wife, confide in me." "Much reason you rich people give one to confide in you," at length Jack replied. "You wish me to trust your friendship. I)id you six years ago, when you all but forbade me your house? You were no doubt afraid that poor, tattered, drunken Jack would disgrace his rich half' sister's funeral, and so you did not even give him notice that she had departed this life " "No, Jack, I must undeceive you there., At that time I had lost all trace of you; a heavy trouble had fallen upon me and my wife, and we seldom saw any one, or went   - ;ft f(hm 1 AbR be.     31 abroad ourselves, except upon necessary business. No,  Jack, there you do me wrong." "So you condescend to justify yourself to me. It is well; timea must be changed with you. Come into the house, and learn a lesson upon riches and poverty--a lesson for which you may be the better all your life." Mr. Sellers turned towards' his wife. Her soft dark eyes were brimming over with tears; but she bowed her i head as much as to say, "Let us go in." I So they followed Jack, who led them into a damp, mouldy apartment, where a few embers in a rusty grate gave out but a small degree of heat, that was by no means sufficient to dry the humid walls. But there-was some- thing there worse than the scent of mould and humidity. Upon an old deal table was raised a white heap, most fear- fully like a coffin covered with a ragged tablecloth; and the room was filled with a pungent, searching odor, that caused both Mr. Sellers and Martha to step backwards. They attempted to recover themselves without giving any sign of their disgust, but Jack had perceived the move- ment, and he laughed bitterly. "Yes," he said, " you are not deceived. It is a slovenly, unhandsome corpse that stands betwixt the wind and your nobility. You cannot breathe five minutes in the same room with it. How would you like to be compelled to eat with it, drink with it, and sleep with it?" "But," said Mr. Sellers, "' if you have not funds to bury the body of your poor child-for such I suppose it to be, though I never heard that you were married--if you have not the necessary funds, why did you not apply to me?" "To the rich brother-in-law, who looked and sneered me : out of his house!" said Jack Marvel. "No, no: the poor relation, though reckoned, no doubt, the very scum of the earth, had too much pride for that. I contrived to beg and  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7943-00000016"/> 32      5   btlnas Siorie. borrow from better men what would buy my poor boy a coffin, but not until he had lain dead a week. I then got some of my neighbors to go with me, and we took him to the churchyard where his poor mother lies-if the hasn't been dug up to make room for others. There the man who wears a black gown asked me if the child had been baptized. I told him, No. Where were the funds to come from? I should have to starve a month for the burial fees." So he told me coolly he could not bury it there, and I had better take it away again. - There is the difference between your rich and your poor. A poor man-can neither get his soul saved nor his dead put out of his sight. You rich men intend to keep heaven very select, it seems." Mr. Sellers saw it would be of no use attempting to reason with a desperate man, so he silently placed a couple of sovereigns upon the ragged tablecloth, and told Jack he would endeavor to make some arrangements for the inter- ment of the dead Ibody, which ought not any longer to be delayed. Jack frowned, and was about to refuse the money; but a glance at the little white heap appeared to shake his purpose. "For his sake; for my boy's sake," he murmured. Just at this moment, two little girls, who would have been pretty children but for the dirt, and rags, and emacia- tion that disguised their original appearance, ran in, and shrank back at the sight of the strangers. 1"Come in, dears," said the bride; " come in. Don't be afraid.?' The youngest looked up in her kind face; and, ap- parently encouraged by what it saw there, came forward, and took hold of her gloved hand with its dirty little fingers. "I want some bread,'? it said. Jack drew  it towards him. "Mary shall have some   I        T S trj istmas ih-rb.     33 bread soon, and Emma also. It is for the sake of these and that poor lad who there lies dead," he added, turning to Mr. Sellers, "that I do not refuse your dirty gold." The bride and her husband went silently away. Martha was the first to speak. "We have now to inquire for Tom Sellers," she- said. "God grant that we may not witness such another scene. Oh! my dear Charles, the knowledge that such misery exists in our wealthy manufacturing towns, side by side with the utmost luxury, is enough to make even those who can afford them forswear all superfluities for ever." "I am quite of your opinion, my dear," returned her husband. "But, with regard to the wretched man whom we have just seen, I fear his miserable position is very much his own fault. He once possessed advantages, which, if he had followed them up, would have made a very different individual of him. But, when the demon of strong drink has seized upon a man, the recovery of the victim is very rare. He falls step by step, until he becomes, to use poor Jack's expression, the scum of the earth." "We will try to reclaim him," said the bride eagerly, while her face glowed with charitable enthusiasm. "You, dear Charles, shall contrive the means." The abode of Tom Sellers, was quite at the other end of the town; and, as the bride, notwithstanding her stout heart, was by this time pretty well fatigued, as well as somewhat hungry, they stopped at a baker's to-buy a couple of biscuits, and then got into a passing -omnibus. This speedily conveyed them into the Central Market; where they alighted, and inquired at one of the shops for Cow- gate. But Tom Sellers had removed': and the people who had taken the house where he had formerly lived, being strangers, could give no information as to his whereabouts. 2*  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7943-00000017"/> 34         #mlhim itoix. It was now about twelve o'clock; and as- Mr. Sellers and Martha turned away disappointed, and puzzled what to do next, a troop of boys poured forth from a grammar-school close at hand. After them came a middle-aged man, of respectable appearance and comfortable exterior, whom Mr. Sellers immediately recognised as his cousin Tom. "I have not here the same cause for self-reproach as I had in the other case," he said to Martha. "It was Tom's own fault that our acquaintance dropped. He seems to have a good berth of it now, however, for I never saw a man so altered in eleven months' time. Come, let us over- take him." It was no difficult matter; for Tom walked with the dignity of an alderman, and looked as if nothing in the world had power No increase his speed or his circulation. He was a round, sleek man, with falling shoulders, close- cropped hair, and cheeks totally devoid of whiskers. As they came up with him, he slowly turned, and stared abstractedly at them, with an expression as though he were solving the fortieth proposition of Euclid. "Good morning, cousin Tom," said Mr. Sellers, cheer- fully. "Allow me to introduce my wife.)" Tom came slowly out of his mathematics, and presented a broad, beaver-clad palm, first to his cousin, and then to Martha. "My house is close at hand," he said, after the first greetings were over.- "I shall be most happyif -you will do me the honor of stepping in." Pleased at the contrast between this and the former recognition, the bride and her husband complied, and were hospitably received by Tom's wife, a large, buxom, motherly body, with eyes as black as sloes. "And how are the young ones, Tom?" said Mr. Sellers, when they had discussed some excellent bread and butter,   n dICtigtmt s Unteh.      35 with a glass of home-made wine. "Let me see, how many had you when I last had the pleasure of seeing you?" "Seven, Mr. Sellers: now I have nine. The last time my good woman presented me with twins. I might have pulled a wry face at this, had not my election to the- second mastership of the grammar-school taken place the next day. We shall now do very well, provided that Hannah be less bountiful in her presents another time." The good-wife blushed and simpered; and four or five rosy little girls rushed in from school, all dressed alike in brown stuff dresses and straw bonnets with green ribbons. "Why, my dear fellow," said Mr. Sellers, " you appear to be partial to the feminine gender." "All girls but three, cousin, all girls but three. The puzzle will be, as my wife often says, how to find husbands for them." The buxom Hannah blushed again, till her very ears glowed. "You must not mind Tom," she said; "he is always at his jokes, though he can put on such a grave face. Since we were a little better off, I have had some trouble to keep him in order, I can assure you." "Well," said Mr. Sellers, "I think we had better come to the purpose of our visit. My wife and I called expressly to invite you to dinner on Christmas-day.  Quite a family party." Tom's eyes sparkled. "We shall be most happy," he said; " but what shall we do withs the children, Hannah? They fully reckoned upon a game at snap-dragon." "If you will excuse me," Hannah began "Oh, no!" exclaimed Martha, who had taken quite a fancy to Mrs. Tom; "we can allow of no excuse. You must bring the children with you, twins' and- all. Isabella and I will help keep them in order; and they shall play at-  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7943-00000018"/> 36        }ttrtmai fibrin snap-dragon, and blind-man's-buff also, to their hearts' con- tent." So this plan was agreed upon; and Mr. and Mrs. Sellers departed, quite delighted with such a pleasant con- trast to their other visit. "Poor Mary! if we -could but have found her out," sighed Mrs. Sellers. "It is of no use applying to a Direc- tory. I looked among the D's the other day, and the name of Drummond was not among them. They must be in lodgings somewhere." Just then, the noise of a window opening above his head, caused him to look up. A female head protruded itself through the open sash, and he stood as if struck dumb and senseless; for this head, in braids and cap, was that of his long lost daughter. It was indeed Mary. She had opened the window to admit a little air, foggy and impure as it necessarily was, in that unhealthy locality; and, upon beholding her father in the street below st anding transfixed and gazing upon her, she uttered a suppressed shriek, and fell back into her husband's arms, who had just returned from giving a music lesson; the first since his long illness. At the sound of that shriek, Mr. Sellers recovered from the amazement into which his daughters sudden appearance had thrown him; and, rushing to the lodging-house door, without giving any explanation to Martha, he knocked at it in a style so different from his usually gentle, collected man- ner, that had she not before divined what had happened, she might have feared that he had taken leave of his senses. A tawdry girl speedily appeared in answer to the knock; but he thrust her aside without ceremony, and ascending the stairs three at a time, as if he feared his daughter would be- spirited away from him, appeared before the sitting. room door just as Mary opened it.   FOR^ ft)ljrifstmatw xtribe,  37 We leave the reader to imagine the hugging, and cry- ing, and all the usualaccompaniments of such a meeting; only stopping to relate how Martha was detained outside by the tawdry servant, who firmly believed that .a couple of thieves were taking the house by storm; and how Henry Drummond had to go down to bring her in, and vouch for her respectability. "Isabella has bpen beforehand with us, Mary tells me," said Mr. Sellers, when, the first excitement over, they were able to discuss matters quietly together. "Indeed!"' said Martha. "I trust you will pardon her disobedience. What a matter of pleasant surprise will this reconciliation be to her! There is scarcely anything in the world so delightful as experiencing an unlooked-for pleasure." "Except the creating of it," said a deep voice at the door. All turned; and Andrew Fairlegh, for it was he, stalked forward into the middle of the room. The Sellers and he were soon intimate; for they speedily recognised a brother spirit, and he was already well ac- quainted with them from Isabella's report; who, the reader must be apprised en passant, had been visiting Mary every day from  the period of the bride's arrival. Singularly enough, at each of these visits she had encountered Andrew; who, for some reason or other, was seldom away from the house. It was now unanimously agreed that the additional guests -honest Andrew being   included in the invitation--should take their places at the Christmas-dinner, without previous notice to the Misses Sellers; and, all being satisfactorily arranged, the happy pair departed; Mr. and Mrs. Sellers arriving at home just in time to make themselves comfortable before dinner. Christmas-eve arrived, presenting itself in very different  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7943-00000019"/> 38        (tSitma itorbs. aspects to the. rich merchant and the poor artisan; the thrif- ty, and the drunken, and dissipated; the charitable, and those whose " bowels of compassion" had long been closed to the cry of their needy brethren. Around some hearths shone the cheering light of fire-glow and heart-warmth, rejoicing in surrounding comforts, and the power of dis- tributing them to those who were less happily situated. Others were jocund with song and laughter; but no remem- brance of the poor and suffering was there to moderate the laughter, and impart a deeper tone of feeling to the song; and so both sounded harsh and cold, and shallow as their owners. Some were gilded with the lunar rays of gratitude, reflecting in their softened lustre the ardent beams of the sun of beauty that had called them into existence. On others, again, brooded a thick gloom of physical cold and darkness, and that bitterness of the spirit, which is still worse to bear than these outward evidences of selfishness on the one hand and improvidence on the other. Jack Marvel's dead had been decently interred. The horror had been removed from under the ragged table- cloth on the deal table; the house fumigated; and the lit. tle ones supplied for once with as much bread as they could eat. A cheerful fire burned in the rusty grate, and Jack himself was attired in an old black suit which had once belonged to Mr. Sellers, and in which he looked more re- spectable than he had done before for many a long day. All this had been effected by the rich man's kindness; and one would have expected to have found Jack's heart warm- ed and cheered, as were the still bare walls of his misera-- ble dwelling. Yet, .as the haggard-looking man sat brood- ing over the fire-light, while his little ones played about the floor, there was no genial glow on his features, to corres- pond with the improved aspect of things around him. In fact, as is common with poverty that has not left behind it   Age drfsinam  Hrite      39 the dross of pride in the furnace of afflietion, Jack was wavering between an angry dislike, on the one hand, to receive these comforts from a man whom he had sworn to himself to hate and despise, and, on the other, a species of jealous dissatisfaction that more had not been done for him- self and his children. "While he was about it," thought the discontented man, " he might as well have got me back my bed, and that proud young madam, his wife, who scarcely deigned to speak two words when she was here, might have sent a bundle of her cast-off clothing, to make the children warm and decent. It is gall and poison to receive anything from the rich, but"-and here Jack swore a fearful oath--"while I was doing the thing, I'd take care I did it handsomely." He had just arrived at this conclusion when a loud knock came to the door, breaking in upon his reflections, and startling him considerably. "What a fool I am!" he thought. "I dare say it's only Sam Jones, coming in to beg a light. I'll teach him to knock, if he hammers in that way, the . Come in, he shouted rudely. The door was flung wide open, and in marched-not Sam Jones, as he expected-but two men, bearing between them a hamper of very considerable dimensions, and equally weighty with its size, if one might judge by the evident muscular exertion of its bearers, as they set it down on the mud floor. "All right," said one of them. "This 'ere be Mister John Marvel's, aint it?' ' '"Yes," said Jack, shortly. The men departed; and the little girls, who had ceased i their play to gaze at them, ran towards their father. "Father, father, big box! Come, look, father!" Jack hesitated-for in the mood in which he; then was,  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7943-00000020"/> 40        !ristmas tofira he would have scorned to -testify any curiosity, however natural--but the importunities of the children at length prevailed upon him to. examine the hamper. It was well corded, and directed in a clear, decided feminine hand, which gave him no clue to the sender, as he was totally unacquainted with the handwriting. "Father, be quick and open it. Do, pray, father." "Leave me room then, lasses," said Jack, beginning to relax in his ill-humor at the touch of their importunate caresses; for, reckless and desperate as the wretched man had become, he had ever been a fond, affectionate father. "Leave me a bit of room. You, Emma, take hold of this knot. Now, Mary, help to lift the end of the hamper- there, there's beauties-while I pull the rope from under. Now, we have only got to unfasten it, and look in." And a glorious sight rewarded their exertions. First came three large bundles of clothing, containing shirts, stockings, drawers, and so forth, for Jack; and everything needful to clothe the little girls from top to toe. Then fol- lowed a packet of tea, another of sugar, a huge side of bacon, a large meat-pie, a piece of cold roast beef, and last, not least, a glorious Christmas pudding. "Father!" cried the little girls, as Jack extracted from the midst of these something nearly square, wrapped up in paper-" father, what is that?" It was a New Testament, out of which dropped a letter for Jack, superscribed by the same hand which had written the direction on the card. This letter was from Martha, as our readers will have already anticipated, begging, in few words, that he would accept the hamper and its contents as a Christmas offering of peace and good-will from Mr. Sellers, who would do himself the pleasure of calling upon his cousin in the course of a few days. "Do not refuse us," it concluded, "the happiness of being of service to you   --  afy stmas' Nrite.     41 and your little girls, at a seasonrwhen all old grudges ought to be-forgotten, or only serve as incentives to the exercise of Christian forgiveness., The children began to dance with delight round the old chest where all these good things were spread out, occasion- ally stopping to smell at the pudding, and extract a raisin or a bit of candied peel from its ample sides; and Jack, bolting the door to prevent the intrusion of any neighbor, sat down again before the fire, with Martha's letter in his hand, and, placing a foot upon each hob, fell into a totally new train of reflections suggested thereby. It was Christmas-eve also with the Drummonds and their friend Andrew; and there, indeed, the hearts danced to the flickering of the cheerful blaze, and reflected its warmth in their own glow of happiness.  For Mary, pleasant little Mary, looked so serenely content in the anticipation of the morrow's delight, that her youthful freshness had all come back again, restoring the dimples that fatigue, anxiety, and sorrow had well-nigh changed into wrinkles. Her altered aspect communicated its gladness to her husband and their visitor. In short, the Yule-log was upon the fire, and they were determined to enjoy their Christmas-eve in fitting style. "Dear me," said Andrew, suddenly rising, and pushing back his chair, "I had almost forgotten. Mrs. Drummond, can you mull port?'" Mary answered in the affirmative; and forth issued from the prolific pocket of the shaggy greatcoat an ounce of nut- megs and a bottle of Oporto's best. We may imagine what were the toasts drunk and the sentiments expressed over the moderate bumpers of Mary's excellent mulled port.   : Brightly shone the holly-berries, and cheerily waved the laurel, ivy, and bay, and other evergreens that decked the  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7943-00000021"/> 42         Qrifmas fanrito walls, the windows, and every available corner in the hand- some drawing-room at Beech House. Mr. Sellers and Mar- tha were already there, to receive their guests, and were meanwhile anticipating the pleasant denouement of their little mystery. "I trust," said Martha, " that Mary and her husband will arrive just at the right time, neither too soon nor too late. I think our directions were plain enough." "Oh, I have no fear," replied the husband. "Let me look at you, dearest. One would get tired of black satin upon any one else, but really it suits you so well, my little queen. And that wreath upon your smooth hair, is it real ivy and holly-berries, love?" "As real, darling, as the decorations of the walls and windows. But, hark! some one arrives. And none of your daughters are down yet. Isabella is not wont to be so long in dressing." Now we must let our readers into a little secret, and in- form them that, with the true divination of a woman of her perceptive powers, the bride had anticipated the possibility of a mutual liking between Andrew and Isabella; and, de- sirous at any rate of promoting the understanding between two such congenial characters, and knowing how much the outer may be considered the type of the inner, had herself directed the choice of Isabella's-attire for the occasion. -It was to be of the simplest white lutestring, without flutter- ing ribbons or ornament of any kind. A broad dark-green sash alone restrained its smooth folds; and around the pale golden tresses was bound a wreath of the delicate wild ivy, unintermingled with anything brighter or more showy. The first arrivals were Mr. and Mrs. Tom Sellers, with their retinue of children; the five youngest of whom were sent for the present along with the servant, who had come to carry the twins, to play in a large cheerful room pre-   - at ttrisztmas Oride,.     43 pared for their reception; where aLiice girl, the eldest of Carry's Sunday-school class, was in waiting, to help to keep them in order. Mrs. Tom was rather timid and fluttered at first: for, being a plain master-builder's daughter, she con- sidered Tom's relations very grand people indeed; but the sweet, frank manners of our bride soon placed her quite at her ease, and when the Misses Sellers at length made their appearance, she bore her introduction to them with great composurle. "Isabella," said Martha, drawing her aside, " where is your ivy wreath? Why have you on that bright pink sash? And what has detained you so long? "I am almost ashamed to tell you, Martha. When I was quite ready, I went to help my sisters, who had not yet begun to dress; they said it was so unfashionable an hour for a dinner-party, and such queer people were colm- ing. They even doubted whether they should dress at all; and teased me so unmercifully about what they called my classical attire, ascribing it all to your singular notions, that I turned coward, partly for your sake, and made a little alteration in one or two particulars." "And if you wish to gratify me, dearest Isabella, at this my house-warming, you will alter back again to the wreath and the green sash, and take off that fine brooch. I have a particular reason for this, which I will tell you half a year hence." Isabella fixed her blue eyes on her friend's countenance with a look of mild inquiry, but nothing was to be seen but a kind of suppressed archness. However, the young girl hastened to obey, and while she was still up-stairs, another rat-tat-tat sounded at the hall-door. The bride glanced ' uneasily at her husband, but her half-formed- fears were quickly dispelled by the announcement of Mr. MiFarlane. And now Isabella came down in all her classical loveli-  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7943-00000022"/> "        lCtmatm Sioi . ness, and dinner was on the point of being announced. But there was a delay unaccountable to ,the majority of the company. Conversation flagged, and a kind of pause of expectation prevailed. Mr. and Mrs. Sellers, too, appeared fidgety, and cast uneasy glances towards the door. At length there was another summons upon the knocker, a slight bustle on the stairs. Jane and Caroline looked at each other with surprised inquiry; the rest of the guests turned their heads eagerly, to see who the new arrivals might be; and the bride and her husband moved hastily towards the door.- Again we must call upon the reader's imagination to fill the place which we resign, in humble confession of our in- adequacy to describe the sensation caused by the entrance of Mr. and Mrs. Drummond. The tearful delight -of Isa- bella, albeit restrained by the presence of so many strange witnesses; the bewildered astonishment of Carry and Jane; the agitat on of poor little Mary; and the sympathy of our benevolent Martha, with the extreme delight of her husband, whose heart's portals, once expanded, seemed in no danger of ever closing again,-all formed a scene never to be for- gotten by the parties concerned. "But where is Mr. Fairlegh?" asked the bride, when they had time to think of any one out of the immediate family circle, Isabella started, and then pretended not to listen for the reply; which, however, she heard distinctly. '"He begged me to present his kindest regards, and said that unavoidable business prevented him from accepting your invitation to dinner, but that lhe would be with you shortly afterwards." Martha looked towards Isabella, and their eyes met. There was an archness in the glance of the bride that made the latter blush, in spite of herself; but she thought, "My fat          .   ICN f"as Abte     45 new mamma is no witch, after all; what can she know?" So, when the huge original made his appearance, just as the dessert was set upon the table-for what with the young- sters, who were lost in astonishment at the handsome set- out, and the zest with which their elders enjoyed the occa- sion, the dinner lasted to quite an unusual period--the only thing observable in Isabella's manner was a kind of friendly empressement, which completed her beauty, by adding to it animation. It was now getting dark, and as soon as a movement had been effected into the drawing-room, Martha and Isa- bella spoke low together, and the latter left the room for several minutes. "What can this mystery be between Mrs. Sellers and Isabella?" whispered Jane to Caroline, as they sat apart employed in the amiable occupation of quizzing the guests. "The little boudoir has been kept locked all day. I tried to get in when they were there this morning, but Isabella came to the door, and told me I should know all about it this evening. Look! Mrs. Sellers has taken the key from her pocket, and now Isabella is going in with a light. She was too quick for us to see anything through the door, though." In about the 'space of ten minutes Isabella returned, leaving the mysterious portal open behind her. Mr. Sellers gave his arm to Mrs. Tom, who nervously accepted the honor, and desired the rest to follow. All, impelled by curiosity, immediately obeyed; and the little apartment was speedily filled to overflowing. Their eyes turned in surprise to the centre of the boudoir; for there, beneath a canopy of holly and mistletoe, stood a fine Christmas-; tree. 6"How beautiful!" exclaimed some of the company. "What is it?" "What does it mean?" asked others, who  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7943-00000023"/> "        dllrtmas toibr. had never heard of this beautiful and pleasing German custom. The little children danced and clapped their hands; the twins held out their arms, and crowed; and the servants, who had been ordered to assemble in the drawing- room, crowded round the door, to see what was going for- ward. "This is a Christmas-tree," said Mr. Sellers, "first in- vented by our neighbors the Germans. The proper time for its exhibition is Christmas-eve, but we took the liberty of postponing it to this day, to celebrate the happy occasion of welcoming back a much-loved daughter and her esteemed husband; and of renewing our acquaintance with many kind friends, too long neglected. And now Mrs. Sellers will perform -her part of the evening's solemnities." For the benefit of our readers who are not acquainted with the beautifuldescriptionsof the Christmas-tree in Mary Howitt's and other modern works and translations, we will just say, that the one in question was a young fir-tree, placed in a large tub, gaily painted for the occasion. Its branches were hung with tiny tapers, cut paper, oranges, apples, bunches of raisins, figs, bonbons, .and other showy and delectable trifles, besides more solid ornaments, in the shape of pretty and suitable presents for the children, young peo- ple, and servants. "Isabella,' said Mr. Sellers, as the distribution of the presents began.  But Isabella was not forthcoming. "I saw her a moment ago," said Jane, "talking to Mr. Fairlegh under the lamp." "And here she is still,' said honest Andrew, bravely handing Isabella out of the corner which had attracted the couple to its snug recess. "Here she is, ready to dance Sir Roger De Coverley, or anything else that may be required- of her."  "Oh! a dance by all means," vociferated John M'Far-   dZ;e frirtma$s ribe.     47 lane--" a, dance under the mistletoe. I can cut a figure in that dance myself," and the little man hopped about on one leg, until every one was glad to get out of his way. "Be sober, man," said Mr. Sellers. "My bride has a meerschaum for you, which she begs you to accept, for her sweet sake." "And a doll for me!"-"And a drum for me!" "Hush, children," said buxom Mrs. Tom. Just then, a dull, dead tramp, as of a number of people marching up the carriage-drive, .sounded from the garden outside. "Oh! sir," said one of the servants, coming breathlessly from the window, where she had been looking out, '" such a number of people on the lawn! It can't be the Chartists, sure." "Martha," said Mr. Sellers, "postpone the proceedings a moment. I will go and see what it means." A few moments of suspense ensued, and some of the ladies and children began to look half frightened. Mrs. Tom pressed closer to her husband, and Mary hastened across the room to Henry's side. "It is only," said Mr. Sellers, returning, " a parcel of people who fancy that my little Martha here has done them good service this hard frost. They insist upon seeing her at one of the windows, that they may cheer her." The green damask curtains were thrown back, the shut- ters of the principal window opened, and by the blaze of light in the room behind, Martha's figure, was plainly seen by those on the lawn below. Then arose a shout from men, women, and children. Andrew Fairlegh stepped out on the balcony,- and taking off his hat, notwithstanding the cold of the night, signed to them to be quiet. "4 Listen to nie, my firiends," he said; " this is Christmas, :time, as you well know. Your benefactress is yet a bride. bx  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7943-00000024"/> 48    -     ndrist $tories. Lift up then your hands and hats, and your honiest hearts along with them, and join with me and our friends within, in three times three for the Christmas Bride." And those without, and those within, heartily responded to the cheer; while Martha, her meek head drooping, and her dark eyes filled with tears, would willingly have re- treated friom the public homage thus offered to private and most Christian worth. For what had she done, but carry into practice, as much as in her lay, the golden rule for human morality through all time--"Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do you even so to them." It would certainly cost us some trouble, some ridicule, possibly loss of worldly friends, and distribution of worldly goods, but what large-hearted man or woman, looking at the present in the light- of the future, would not wish to go and do likewise? So we join the happy company in the drawing-room at Beech-House, and humbly begging for a moment's audience, add from our inmost souls, "One cheer more for the Christ- mas Bride., \u      t    The Christmas Eve Letter. IN the town of Ifiracombe, one of the sweetest and most picturesque of the many lovely watering-places which line the Devon coast, there lived, some twenty years ago, a Mr. Meddlycott, " a general practitioner." His reputation with the ladies stood high. He had had the honor of bringing into the world half the squirearchy of his district, and was considered by all the caudle-loving gossips for fifty miles round as a "very famous man." Years and infirmities had stolen upon him, and he was me- ditating a retreat from the more active duties of his calling, when, one Christmas-eve, he received a letter, bearing the London postmark, requesting him to be " without fail in or near Ilfracombe the ensuing day, when a lady from a con- siderable distance would reach it, for the express purpose of consulting him." Never did a letter assail more successfully the foibles of the party to whom it was addressed.          : "My fame, then, has reached the metropolis!"-so ran the gentle whisper of gratified vanity. "A lady from a considerable distance,-London, without doubt,-desires to 3  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7943-00000025"/> consult me. A person, unquestionably, of consideration, from the handsome inclosure which the letter contains. Ah! sooner or later merit is appreciated even in this' world!" And with this soothing apophthegm, Mr. Meddlycott smoothed down his waistcoat, and sallied forth on his usual rounds with a countenance beaming with self-complacency. Christmas-day arrived, dark, dreary, and tempestuous,- mid-day, without one glimpse of the sun, had passed,-and twilight had given place to a night of pitchy darkness, with- out bringing any tidings of the expected arrival. The heading of the letter, " strictly confidential," had excluded Mrs. Meddlycott from all knowledge of its contents; and the doctor, having fumed and fidgeted for a couple of hours in a way that irritated his helpmate's curiosity almost beyond endurance, was about to retire to rest, when-a ring at the bell was heard, and a note handed in. Its contents ran thus:-  "Mrs. Mackenzie is arrived, and wishes to see Mr. Meddlycott immediately. "12 Ocean Place." A few minutes sufficed to bring the doctor to one of the quietest, most secluded, and yet comfortable lodging-houses, near the bay; on reaching which, he was ushered into a small drawing-room, where, veiled and in travelling costume, sat a lady. She wag evidently a foreigner; spoke English imperfectly, and with difficulty. Her age appeared about forty, and her look, and manner, and bearing, all indicated the woman of refinement and high-breeding. There was a pause of evident and painful embarrass- ment when Mr. Meddlycott entered, during which the stranger scanned him as if she would read his inmost soul.   I   iw4e ' rc nntm# 4 be vttter4   There was something in the expression of her eye so merci- less, stern, and defying, that Mr. Meddlycott shrank invo- luntarily from its scrutiny. "I am about to intrust to you, sir, the life of one who is very dear to me. Her situation will speedily demand the exercise of your well known professional skill; and I throw myself confidently on your sense of honor. Before I intro- duce you to my charge, promise me solemnly and sacredly, as in the presence of God, that the circumstances under which you meet, and the professional services you may have to render her, shall never be divulged to human being." The doctor hesitated. "Such a pledge is-most unusual," he remarked, "and "I am aware of it," said the lady- earnestly; "but, under present circumstances, it is indispensable. Your dis- cretion shall be duly recompensed. Unless that pledge be given, here our interview must terminate." "What object is my silence to serve?" That of concealing the shame of a distinguished family," observed the lady, bitterly. "You are yourself a father, and the honor of a daughter is inconceivably dear to you. Need I say more?" Mr. Meddlycott's feelings were touched: his vision became suddenly indistinct; but it was not the keenness-of the evening air which had filled his eyes with water. The lady observed and pursued her advantage; and, before the interview closed, the required promise was again exacted and acceded to. On the third day after the stranger's arrival, a hasty summons from Ocean place again brought Mr. Meddly- cott's activity into play, and added fresh fuel to the curiosity of his portly lady. On this occasion he was introduced to &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7943-00000026"/> 52        C;Brima Siarwe. a fair, dove-eyed girl, whose years appeared barely to exceed sixteen, and whom he did not quit till, after many hours, peril, he left her the mother of a very noble boy. Early the following morning, when Mr. Meddlycott was on the point of starting to visit his youthful patient, he was greeted with the astounding intelligence that the whole party had quitted Ilfracombe at daybreak! The house, hired for a month, had been paid for the preceding evening; no account was left outstanding; every article for house consumption had been paid for on delivery. They seemed to have vanished without leaving any clue to their name or history; for their only attendant had been an elderly female, a German, unable to speak a single word of English. A sealed packet was left in charge of the owner of the house, addressed to Mr. Meddlycott, by whom it was eagerly opened. It contained a bank-note for fifty pounds, and the following brief memorandum:- "Your skill and attention will never be forgotten; the inclosed testifies but inadequately my sense of both. A similar sum will reach you yearly, so long as you are faith- ful to the 'trust reposed in you. Be silent and prosper. Be inquisitive and--             "M." Mrs. Meddlycott's amazement at learning that the fo- reigners had quitted Ilfracombe was unbounded and genuine. For a, full hour she sat lost in conjecture. "Who cotld they be? Which was the invalid? Were they sisters? or mo- ther and daughter? or aunt and niece? What had brought them  to Ilfracombe? What had driven them from it? Was her husband in the secret? Howmany, and whom, did that secret involve? She thought and thought till she was in a perfect fever of curiosity. Twenty times a day did her dear gossips ask   ie rifimav (be gttf er.     53 her for an explanation of that mysterious arrival and depart- ure, and as many times had she the painful mortification of confessing that she was as much in the dark as themselves! In vain did she betake herself to that high settee in that portentous bow-window which commanded the main street of Ilfracombe,-that conspicuous and dreaded observatory, in which so large a portion of her life was passed,-in which so many reputations had been murdered, so many "(facts" promulgated which never had had the slightest foundation, -so many marriages announced as " certain" which had never been contemplated,--so many conversations repeated which had never taken place. Oh! if those walls could have spoken, what a budget of scandal would they not have disclosed! Nor was Mr. Meddlycott less uneasy on his part. Avery pnainful suspicion had taken possession of his mind. The de- parture of the foreigners from Ilfracombe had been described to him by an eye-witness clearly and distinctly enough. They had quitted it, as they had reached it, in a dark green travelling carriage, without crest or armolial bearing of any description. The younger lady seemed a great invalid, and was carefully muffled up. She was carried, rather than as- sisted, into the vehicle, the blinds of which were instantly drawn down! The elder lady gave the necessary directions relative to the arrangement of the luggage and their in- tended route; while the whole attention of the German waiting-woman seemed devoted to the comfort of her youth- ful mistress. But where was the CHILD? No description of their departure made any mention of this appendage; nor did Mr. Meddlycott, bearing his pro- . mise of secresy in painful remembrance, dare to put a direct and open question on the point, The more he reflected on the occurrences of the last eight-and-forty hours, the more  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7943-00000027"/> 54        bArakmas ioick. uneasy did he 'become. The gleam of that cold, hard, re- morseless eye, when the crisis of the mother's agony came on---the beseeching look of the younger female, the scowl with which that look was answered by the elder-the mut- tered imprecation with which she received the helpless infant from the doctor's hands-the grasp with which she clutched it, as if she could have wrung its little neck, and exulted in the deed,-all these minute circumstances re- curred to the medical man's mind, and rendered his repose unusually restless and broken. "I wish I had never seen the parties!" was his hearty but involuntary exclamation, as he turned himself for the twentieth time on his uneasy pillow. "You have been doing something which you ought not," instantly replied his wary helpmate, who had been watching him  with the most intense observation. "A guilty conscience needs no accuser. Don't tell me to the contrary," she continued, perceiving that Mr. Meddlycott meditated an interruption ; "I'm not to be deceived. Don't suppose that I wish to know. Thank God I'm not inquisi- tive. That weakness does not run in my family!" "Oh! oh! oh!" said Mr. Meddlycott, involuntarily. "Keep your dreadful secrets to yourself, if such a course you deem decent or justifiable towards such a woman as my- self. Some day, Mr. Meddlycott-some distant day you will know my value." "A very distant day!" said the doctor,-but, as he was a man of peace, sotto voce. Early the following morning the attack was renewed. 1"Henry, dear, do tell me who were those people in Ocean # Place?" "Henry dear" was in a moment in the arms of Mor- pheus! "What an inveterate sleeper!" cried the inquisitive lady;   le 'lixjrfmnas bt Sefitt,     55 "but I will unravel this mystery, if his nap last short of doomsday!" "Henry dear" was resolved she should not, and took his measures accordingly. "Mrs. Meddlycott," said he, when the breakfast had been removed, "you once wished to possess that China din- ner-service at Eardley's; do you covet it still?" "Do I?" she returned, bitterly: " can I help it? Such a bargain-so perfect-the very thing I want! And such splendid dinner-sets as Mrs. Amy Chichester, and the Hoggs of Appledore, and Mrs. Bencraft of Barnstaple duly parade before me at their yearly dinners; while the vile old delf I amn obliged to use almost breaks my heart when I set my eyes on it! Want a dinner-set! What woman in Ilfia- combe wants one more? And such a bargain!" "It is yours." "Mine! Now, Mr. Meddlycott, you are trifling with my feelings, and it is most ungenerous and unjust!" "It is yours, I repeat,-on one condition." "Name it!" said she, eagerly; and her eyes sparkled with expectation. "That you NEVER allude to those foreigners, in my presence or out of it, again." There was a pause. Mrs. Meddlycott felt this was a very trying moment. Her inquisitive spirit, which no dif- ficulties could subdue; her love of mystery, the keenness with which she hunted down a secret, the pledges which she had given to her sister gossips that she " would NEVER rest till she had probed the very bottom of that Ocean place affair;" all these rose in distinct array before her. But then-the splendid and long-coveted dinner-service,- - the go-by which she could, in consequence, give to Mrs. Amy Chichester, and Mrs. John Bremridge, and others of her contemporaries, who had dared to contest the pas of  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7943-00000028"/> 56           m with;rnilm cousu - ton with her; the triumph with which she would submit it to their inspection; the envy which would almost choke them as they ate off it ; these feelings were balm to her anxious spirit. "I promise," said she faintly; " and you know when I promise I perform." "Admitted-admitted," cried the doctor; and on the following morning the dinner-service was in Mrs. Meddly- cott's possession. Years rolled on; and punctually did the promised sum arrive. Nor was this all. When the doctor's eldest daugh- ter was married, a balik-bill for twenty pounds, bearing the Paris post-mark, made its appearance, on which was a pencilled memorandum, "Towards the bride's trousseau." When his second son was on the eve of sailing for India, a similar sum was forwarded under a similar post-mark, di- rected in the same small, neat, feminine hand, "Towards the young man's outfit." It was clear that there was a sleepless vigilance exercised in some unknown quarter over Mr. Meddlycott's domestic-arrangements; which, though productive of specific advantage, caused at times a feeling of vague but most disagreeable apprehension to overcloud that worthy gentleman's mind. Other changes were at hand. Soon after-the cadet's departure for Bengal, the angel of death called for Mrs. Meddlycott. She belonged to the 1"Independent." congre- gation; and the deacons of that body duly attended her. They remarked one evening, as she was drawing near her end, that hers had been a highly favored career, that her husband had been kind and amiable, and her children du- tiful and prosperous, and that her own health up to that very illness had been perfectly uninterrupted. "All have their trials," was her brief comment. "True; but you  "   e 6Cristmas  be Petea,      57 "I have had mine!  That mystery in Ocean place I could never penetrate, though I tried for years at it! But now all is as one!"Her favorite expression when tho- roughly foiled. "But that matter is really beneath consideration- quite a trifle-utterly unimportant."' "You think so?" said she, quickly; "I don't; and never did. It is carefully cloaked, I grant you: some day or other, however, an awful mystery will be unravelled there!"  "But you die happy?" "I should have died happier could I have divined what those -foreigners came to Ilfracombe about! And then, they left at such an extraordinary early hour! How it has puzzled me!" These were her last words: and as Mr. Quaint, the Independent minister, observed, " they were not edifying." The resignation with which Mr. Meddlycott met his loss was quite exemplary. He was never heard to utter a single murmur!"It was his duty," he said, "to acqui- esce readily and cheerfully. There never was such a wo-  man." That all Ilfracombe admitted. But when'he fin- ished off by saying that he " could never hope to replace her," there were some ladies of a certain age who thought that quite a " non sequitur." To dissipate his grief, he determined, for the first time in his life, to visit London.  was May: town was full: and, as he was looking about on the, to him, unusual bustle, he ran against 'a respectably-dressed woman, to whom he began forthwith to apologize. The female started when she heard the sound of his voice; and, when he had finished Es sentence, looked up in his face with an expression of down- ight terror, which to him was inexplicable. He commenced his excuses de novo : the party uttered no word of reply; 3*  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7943-00000029"/> 58         $rhirtma r itorier. but with a countenance of ashy paleness and a quivering lip, turned abruptly from him, and was soon lost in the crowd. The demeanor of the woman annoyed him; and the more, as he fancied that her features were not strange to him but where, or under what circumstance they had previously met, he was unable to recal. "My bluff North Devon face frightened the lady," said he, as he detailed the rencontre to a friend. "My preten- sibns to good looks were always questionable; but that my visage in my old age actually alarms a woman does indeed afflict me!" "London women are not famed for timidity," said his companion drily. And this rejoinder dismissed the subject., Two days afterwards Queen Adelaide held a drawing- room. Anxious to obtain a glimpse of that matchless beau- ty so peculiarly the characteristic of the British female aris- tocracy, Mr. Meddlycott bribed high for the possession of a window within the palace, which commanded an uninter- rupted view of the Company as they alighted from their carriages, and succeeded. Those who had the privilege of the entree came first: and foremost amongst these was one whose features riveted his attention. She was young, and very beautiful: the small and exquisitely moulded features; the swan-like neck and marble brow; the soft and pleading expression of eye, that, once seen, could not easily be forgotten, recalled her at once to his recollectiongs his foreign and mysterious patient at Ilfracombe. The years that had intervened since they met had only added fulness to her form, and dignity to her carriage; the same mild, calm, gentle, bewitching look of innocence was visible, and hallowed the shrine in which it dwelt. "Who is that lady?" said he to a bystander. "I don't recollect thfe name at this moment; but she is   dike ,itmas m f1t gtitex.     59 a foreign ambassadress; and that stern, dark, harsh-looking man by her side is her husband. Lovely as she looks, she is said to be an unhappy wife." "Oh! the old story, I presume-a faithless husband? ' He loved, and he rode away! Eh?" "No; she is childless; and, on the count's death without issue, his name becomes extinct." "Childless!" repeated Mr. Meddlycott, and fell into a reverie which was anything but agreeable. The next morn- ing he returned to Ilfracombe. He found that during his absence his place had been so successfully supplied by his son, and that matters altogether wore so satisfactory an appearance, that he resolved to carry into effect his long-cherished project-of retiring alto- gether from his profession, and becoming a gentleman at large. The house in Ocean place, which the foreigners had so temporarily occupied, was vacant, and to be sold. He liked the situation, and its easy distance from the bay; gave a fancy price, and became the proprietor. Poor man! he little foresaw at that moment the results by which that ac- quisition was to be accompanied. The house was nicely fit- ted up; and, with the exception of re-papering a room in- tended for his own study, no outlay seemed necessary. But when did the owner of a property recently acquired settle quietly down into the conviction' that no alteration was requisite?  Mr. Meddlycott's anxiety to detect imperfections and remedy deformities had been but imperfectly gratified, when late one evening it struck him that the hearthstone of the kitchen fire-place did not lie altogether square and even, and he resolved that then and there-all the servants being in bed--he would himself raise the blook, and ascertain the intervening obstacle. He accomplished his task with infi-  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7943-00000030"/> 60         Atlfmaw Ittoxe. nite difficulty; and, as a reward, discovered the skeleton of a male infant!  Here was a prize for honest industry! This was curio- sity obtaining its own reward! So much for the anxious and inquiring spirit! '"The pursuit of knowledge under difficulties!"  Mr. Meddlycott was sleepless that night, and the next. "Curse the child!" said he, audibly, when he rose fag- ged and jaded the second morning; " it came into the world, I believe, for no other purpose than to perplex me! And yet," said he,-when the calm still voice of reason ob- tained audience, " after all it is but a case of suspicion. . It does not necessarily follow that these are the remains of that infant which I brought into the world, but could never afterwards trace. They. may be those of the child of some other woman. Fifty different parties have inhabited the house since that eventful evening. Again, why may not this child have died a natural death, and been secreted here from the pressure of poverty, and from no improper or mur- derous motive? One point, however, is most satisfactory, and it is this-that the late Mrs. Meddlycott is gone to her rest. Had this discovery taken place during the lifetime of that exemplary woman, and come in any shape under her cognizance, all Ilfiacombe, nay all Devon, would lSave rung with her righteous indignation. Such were her rigid no- tions of propriety; the necessity she felt of making an ex- ample of all unfortunate feiales; such her impression that the law of the land should be duly obeyed, and all sin and wickedpess made to fly before it, that I do verily believe she would have hung me up before my own door as an accessary after the fact. Well! there is a balm in every bottle, if we but shake it. I said, when Mrg. M. died, ' there was much to be thankfulfor.' I retain the sanqe opinion." But this was not the invariable current of his reflections   HtZ dCI;xgta ma (fie iett      61 upon the subject. There were moments when the most painful surmises agitated his mind. "Am I justified in maintaining my studied reserve on the subject? These moneys which have from time to time reached me, are they the price of blood?   My promise of secresy was undoubtedly given:- am I, at no period, and under no cir- cumstances, justified in recalling it? This last discovery- is it proper, professional, or creditable, to observe unbroken silence respecting it?" These were reflections which ever and anon occurred to and harassed him. His friends observed a marked differ- ence in his spirits and demeanor. He grew nervous, rest- less, irritable; and at times would wake up out of apparently a most painful reverie with the unintelligible ejaculation, "That most abominable child!"   To change the scene, divert his thoughts, amuse and interest him,-for his mind, his friends imagined, was overtasked, as well as the bodily -frame weakened,-his son-in-law proposed that he should pay them a visit, at Paris, where he and his wife were then residing.' The invitation was accepted at once. Paris is Pleasure's head-quarters. -It is the Canaan of the idler. Within its boundary the wings of time seem doubly feathered. It is there, if anywhere, possible for the heartsick to escape from himself. Upon no nation in the world does the pursuit of pleasure sit so gracefully as the French. Their versatility-of character; the rapidity with which they pass from one emotion to the other; the ease with which they adapt themselves to circumstances; their turn for badinage; and the importance with which they invest trifles, render a temporary sojourn in their capital a very joyous affair. All hail ,;o thee, gay city of Paris, with thy filthy trottoirs and well dressed women! Mr.; Meddlycott seemed to enter right heartily into the abandonnement of the hour. His spirits rallied, and his  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7943-00000031"/> 62  'l xrismas tories. appetite improved. But still Mr. Essington's surprise was great when one evening, as they were promenading the Boulevards, he observed his worthy father-in-law look very fixedly-and had he been a younger man, very impudently -on the features of a stout, short, square, stolid-faced woman, who slowly passed them. Then, as if not satisfied with that prolonged survey of her person,' he quitted, abruptly enough, his son's arm, and gave chase. The female looked back; and when she saw him mending his pace, appeared alarmed, and quickened hers. From a walk it became a run, and both speedily were out of sight. "Whew!" cried the son-in-law, giving a long whistle, -"A nice amusement for an old gentleman of sixty-four! The very last species of escapade of which I should have accused my honored relative. What a mercurial old gentle- man he must be! Ha! ha!- ha! It is well the late Mrs. Meddlycott is at rest. Though whether she will remain quiet under these circumstances is to me questionable." In about twenty minutes the old gentleman regained his son-in-law, very much winded. "I have lost her," cried he, in a tone of vexation. "Not for want of giving chase," said the other drily. "She's an old acquaintance of mine," began the doctor. "So I conjectured,'" was the reply of his dutiful son. "Tut! you cannot imagine , "I imagine nothing:" returned Essington, bursting into a roar; " what I actually witnessed was quite sufficient-an elderly gentleman in full chase -of a very ordinary-looking lady. The construction I am to gather from so extraordi- nary a phenomenon you can best determine." "That woman is in possession of a fact which I am most anxious to ascertain.  My own future peace is in- volved in it. I have encountered her before in the public   i9e 4risHtmna Ote Utter.      63 streets of London, where she avoided me. She has done so still more markedly to-day." "Yes," said Essington, maliciously; " of her avoiding you there can be but little doubt; nor of your determinate- ly seeking her." "I have only a single question to put to her," said the doctor, musingly; " that answered, I will never molest her again.," "A single question," said the young man, jestingly. "Come, you are a more modest man than I thought." "I cannot explain myself further, rally me as you will." "For that lay your account, governor, most assuredly, during the remainder of your stay in Paris. But, come, dinner waits! ,We are an hour beyond time. The claret will be hot, and the soup cold." The tide of engagements set in so strongly for several succeeding days after this occurrence, that no opportunity was given to either party for again adverting to the subject. One morning, however, after breakfast, the doctor was jocularly asked by his son-in-law if he would join him in a walk to a distant part of Paris. "Who knows," added he, "but that we may again catch a glimpse of your incog- -nita?2" "She shall not escape me a second time," said the old gentleman, sturdily. "I will call in the assistance of the gensd'armerie." "The gernsd'armerie! If it were not too absurd, I should say we are under szrveillance already." ' Pshaw! who would think it worth while to watch Mryx movements?") said Mr. Meddlycott. "I know not," returned his son, with more gravity of manner than the occasion seemed to warrant; "but the impression is strong on my mind that our movements are  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7943-00000032"/> "        mfifmtras Storted dogged. I have lived sufficiently long inll Paris to be con- versant with some of the tricks of the police; and I can- not resist the suspicion that one in disguise is daily on our trail." "Be it so. He will find it difficult to connect me with any treasonable attempt, I fapcy. I'm not going td become one of the movement party at my time of life. I have too great a desire to carry my head on my shoulders, and to die quietly in my bed." "But the barge idea of being subjected to such espionage is painful." "Not to one who is conscious of having given no just grounds for it," returned the doctor, stoutly. And yet he closed his remark, somewhat singularly, with a sigh. Evening came on, and found Mr. Meddlycott at the opera.- At the end of the first act a noise in an adjoining box attracted his attention; surrounded by a brilliant party, and accompanied by the elder foreigner, whose marked features he so well remembered, there sat the for- eign ambassadress! He looked at her for a few moments calmly and attentively, to satisfy himself of her identity: and then turned for information to a garrulous French deputy near him. "That! oh yes! every information is at monsieur's ser- vice,"-the customary French bow closed the sentence. "That is the Countess . Her husband was ambassador from the   Court to that of St. James. A pretty but unhappy looking woman." "And the elderly female on her left?" ' Speak low when you speak of her. She is the very genius of, intrigue. That woman is connected remotely with more than one crowned head in Europe. She has the blood of Catherine de' Medici in her veins, anld the venom of that accursed monster in her heart!"

She is aunt to the countess, who is her heir; is a woman of immense wealth; but,-how acquired, eh? how acquired? The guillotine alone can tell that! But see, she is looking this way. If it were not fancy, I should say that her gaze is fixed on you; Was there ever seen on earth so savage, so diabolical an expression in a woman's eye? and that jewelled hand! Faugh! there is blood upon i,.- "' The  there is!" said the doctor, involuntarily, and felt very queer. "Humph! you know best whether you have ever cross- ed her path. Her restless eye is again turned this way, and that with so peculiar a lustre, that, excuse me, mon ami, if I do not greatly care about continuing your neighbor. We shall meet again. Au revoir!" At this moment Essington joined him. "I have found," said the doctor to him, in a low, calm tone, " a clue to the mystery which has so long harassed me. This is neither time nor place for the disclosures I am about to make: but as w6 walk homwar^ds this evening, I am resolved to burst the seal of     erto imposed on me, to disburden myo ,g       make a clear breast of it." The ballet' terminated soon afterwards; and as they slowly sought Mr. Meddlycott's home, the latter divulged to his son-in-law all the circumstances connected with the foreigner's visit to Ilfracombe. While tht:narrator was about midway in his tale, a passeny dressed, lounged carelessly past them.;i and, in, observed, as if addressing another individual-- " " eis safety 'it silence!" "Comical, isn't it," said Essington, "under present circumstances?"  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7943-00000033"/> "        dlprttmas $iorte. "Yes," returned the doctor, moodily; " but what I am saying is -in the tragic, not comic, vein ;" and he gravely resumed his confessions. "Pass, sir!-pray pass," said the speaker, at another period of his tale, when a party having the appearance of a military officer seemed to hang on his steps, and apparently to listen to his conversation. "Mille pardons, messieurs,'? was the reply, with a bow, and a shrug, and a grimace, without which no Frenchman can, to his own apparent satisfaction, discharge any of the common courtesies of life. "Now, but for the fashionable air of that fellow," said Meddlycott, "I should have pronounced him one of those cursed eavesdroppers one is ever stumbling upon in Paris; but what is your opinion, Essington, of this history?" "Singular enough!" said the young man; " but I see not how you could have acted otherwise than you did. And now, you cannot adopt decisive measures, your infor- mation, is so very vague. Take my advice, doctor; let it rest where it is." - "It cannot ;,and-it shall not. But I will explain myself more fully to o  lood night!" Ah that   ........ *  th1? ^at w' 1 i'often t t he most eager and self-conhdent do,                 e doctor failed to 'p hsel  attast table. Essington, about eleven, went in search of him. He was out. His servant said, that while dressing two stran- gers had sent up their cards, and begged to see him; that they had askl/:;,f to accompany them to some house in the Faubou ki: ' ' the servant could not remember), to inspect sonml e urious anatomical preparations; that their description seemed to interest Mr. Meddlycott greatly; and that, after breakfasting with him, they had all three left the house in company. 4   ,be (flrimnas deO fat ter.     67 The dinner-hour came, and passed away. Evening- midnight-day-break brought no, tidings of the missing man. Poor Mrs. Essington's alarm about her father be- came extreme. In this feeling, to an extent greater than he chose to admit, Mr. Essington shared. Every search was made; every inquiry instituted; messengers were sent in various directions; a minute description of his person given to the police; and a handsome douceur promised them for promptness and diligence. This last offer Mr. Essington fancied-it might be but fancy-- was received with the most frigid and inexplicable indifference. On the morning of the fourth day, Mr. Meddlycott's remains were recognised in the Morgue, where they had been placed on being rescued from the Seine the preceding evening. But the circumstances of his death remain enveloped in mystery. No inquiries could ever trace, no investigation could ever identify, the parties who had called upon him; nor could any clue ever be found to those " anatomical pre- parations" which he had been so anxious to examine. His watch, purse, and diamond breast-pin were found unin- jured; nor were any marks of violence discernible on his person. Some affect to believe that he had committed suicide,- a conclusion strangely at variance with his easy circum- stances, regular habits, religious opinions, and cheerful dis- position. Others affirm that he perished the victim of a violated promise; and that tranquilly, easily, and happily would his days have closed had he not had the misfortune of receiving a letter on Christmas-eve from the Foreign Ambassadress. Which conclusion is the right one, the GREAT DAY can alone determine!  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7943-00000034"/> Adventures of a New-Year's Eve. -E/M  OTHER KATE, the watchman's wife, at nine o'clock on New-Year's Eve opened her little window, and put out her head into the open air. The snow was reddened by the light from the window as it fell in silent heavy flakes upon the street. She observed the crowds of happy 'people, hurrying to and fro from the brilliantly lighted shops with presents, or pouring out of the various inns and coffee-houses, and going to the dances and other entertainments with which the New Year is married to the Old in joy and pleasure. But when a few cold flakes had lighted on her nose she drew back her head, closed the window, and said to her husband, "Gottheb, stay at home, and let Philip watch for thee to-night; for the snow comes as fast as it can from Heaven, and thou knowest the cold does thy old bones no good. The streets will be gay to- night. There seems dancing and feasting in every house, masqueraders are going about, and Philip will enjoy the sport." Old Gottheb nodded his assent. "I am willing, Kate," he said. "My barometer, the old wound above my knee,   - lbbentuxts of ia tiebo-max G,   6[ has given me warning the last two days of a change of weather. It is only right that my son should aid me in a service to which he will be my successor." We must give the reader to understand, that old Gott- lieb had been a sergeant in one of the king's regiments, until he was made a cripple for life by a musket-ball, as he was the first mounting the walls of a hostile fort in a battle for his fatherland. The officer who commanded the attack received the cross of honor on the battle-field for his heroism, and was advanced in the service; while Gottheb was fain to creep homewards on a pair of crutches. From pity they made him a schoolmaster, for he was intelligent, liked to read, and wrote a good hand. But when the school increased they took it away from him to provide for a young man who could do none of these as well as he, merely because he was a godson of one of the trustees. However, they promoted Gottheb to the post of watchman, with the reversion of it to his son Philip, who had in the meantime bound himself to a gardener. It was only the good house- wifery of Mistress Katharine, and the extreme moderation of old Gottheb, that enabled them to live happily on the lit- tle they possessed. Philip gave his services to the gardener for his board and lodging, but he occasionally received very fine presents when he carried home flowers to the rich peo- ple of the town. He was a fresh handsome young fellow, of six-and-twenty. Noble ladies often gave him sundry extra dollars for his fine looks, a thing they would never have thought of doing for an ugly face. Mrs. Kate had already put on her cloak to go to the gardener's house to fetch her son, when he enterled the apartment. "Father," said Philip, giving a hand to both father and mother, "it's snowing, and the snow won't do you much good. I'll take the watch to-night, and you can get to bed."  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7943-00000035"/> 70        itmam ito-ie, "You're a good boy," said old Gottheb. "And then I've been thinking," continued Philip, "that as to-morrow is New Year's Day, I may come and dine with you and make myself happy. Mother perhaps has no joint in the kitchen, and", "No," interrupted the mother, ' we've no joint, but then we have a pound and a half of venison; with potatoes for a relish, and a little rice with laurel leaves for a soup, and two flasks of beer to drink. Only come, Philip, for we shall live finely to-morrow. Next week we may do better, for the X New Year's gifts will be coming in, and Gottheb's share will be something! Oh! we shall live grandly."x "Well, so much the better, dear mother," said Philip; "but have you paid the rent of the cottage yet?" Old Gottheb shrugged his shoulders. Philip laid a purse upon the table.  "There are two-and-twenty dollars that I have saved. I can do very well without them; take them for a- New Year's gift, and then we; can all three enter on the new year without a debt or a care. God grant that we may end it in health and happiness! Heaven in its goodness will provide for both you and me!" Tears came into Mother Katharine's eyes as she kissed her son; old Gottheb said, "Philip, you are the prop and stay of our old age. Continue to be honest and good, and to love your patents, so will a blessing rest on you. I can give you nothing for a New Year's gift, but a prayer that you may keep your heart pure and true--this is in your power- you will be rich enough--for a clear conscience is a Heaven in itself."  So said old Gottheb, and then he wrote down in an account-book the sum of two-and-twenty dollars that hiss son had given him. "All fhat you have cost me in childhood is now nearly   thfentltea of a lQ-H1at'u (be,   '1 paid up. Your savings amount to three hundred and seven- teen dollars which I have received." "Three hundred and seventeen dollars!" cried Mistress Katharine, in the greatest amazement; and then turning to Philip with a voice full of tenderness, "Ah, Philip," she said, 4thou grievest me. Child of myheart! Yes,indeed, thou dost. Hadst thou saved that money for thyself thon might'st have bought some land with it, and started as gar- dener on thy own account, and married Rose. Now that is impossible. But take comfort, Philip. We are old, and thou wilt not have to support us long." "Mother!" exclaimed Philip, and he frowned a little; "what are you thinking of? Rose is dear to me as my life, but I would give up a hundred Roses rather than desert you and my father. I should never find any other parents in this world but you, but there are plenty of Roses, although I would have none but Mrs. Bittner's Rose, were there even ten thousand others." "You are right, Philip," said Gottheb, " loving and mar- rying are not in the commandments-but to honor your father and mother is a duty and commandment. To give up strong passions and inclinations for the happiness of your parents is the truest gratitude of a son. It will gain you the blessing from above: it will make you rich in your own heart." "If it were only not tooi long for Rose to wait," said Mrs. Katharine, "' or if you could give up the engagement altogether! 'For Rose is a pretty girl, that can't be denied; and though she is poor, there will be no want of wooers. She is virtuous and understands housekeeping." "Never fear, mother," replied Philip; "Rose has so. lemnly sworn to marry no man but me; and that is suffi- cient. Her mother has nothing to object-to me. And if I was in business and had money enough to keep a wife with,  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7943-00000036"/> 72        xnristmas Ionit Rose would be a wife to-morrow. The only annoyance we have is, that her mother will not let us meet so often as we wish. She says frequent meetings do no good; but I differ from her, and so does Rose--for we think meeting often does us both a great deal of good. And we have agreed to meet to-night, at twelve o'clock, at the great door of St. Gregory's church, for Rose is bringing in the year at a frienrd's house; and I am to takeher home." In the midst of such conversation the clock of thie neigh- boring tower struck three quarters, and Philip took his father's greatcoat from the warm stove where Katharine had carefully laid it, wrapped himself in it, and taking the lantern and staff, and wishing his parents good night, pro- ceeded to his post. Philip stalked majestically through the snow-covered streets of the capital, where as many people were still visi- ble as in the middle of the day. Carriages were rattling in all directions, the houses were all brilliantly lighted. Our --watchman enjoyed the scene, he sang his verses at ten o'clock, and blew his horn lustily in the neighborhood of St. Gregory's church, with many a thought on Rose, who was then with her friend. "Now, she hears me,77 he said to himself; " now she thinks on me, and forgets the scene around her. I hope she won't fail me at twelve o'clock at the church door." And when he had gone his round, he always returned to the dear house and looked up at the lighted window. Sometimes he saw female figures, and his heart beat quick at the sight; sometimes he fancied he saw Rose herself; and sometimes he studied the long sha- dows thrown on the wall or the ceiling, to discover which of them was Rose's, and to fancy what she was doing. It was certainly not a very pleasant employment -to stand in frost and snow and look at a windowT; but what care lovers for fi'ost and snow? And even watchmen are as fiery and I -             -&amp;   bbemntrats of a-P. Abt-A's b$e.  73 romantic lovers as ever were the knights of ancient ballads. He only felt the effects of the frost when, at eleven : o'clock, he had to set out upon (is round. His teeth chat- tered with cold; he could scar -call the hour or sound his horn. He would willingly have gone into a beer-house to warm himself at the fire. As he was -cing through a lonely by-street, he met a man with a black half-mask on his face, enveloped in a fire-colored silken mantle, and wear- ing on his head a magnificent hat turned up at one side, and fantastically ornamented with a number of high and waving plumes. Philip endeavored to escape the mask, but in vain. The stranger blocked up his path and said--"Ha! thou art a fine fellow; I like thy phiz amazingly. Where are you going, eh? I say, where are you going?" "To Mary street," replied Philip. "I am going to call the hour there." "Enchanting!" answered the mask. "I'll hear thee: I'll go with thee. Come along, thou foolish fellow, and let me hear thee, and mind thou singest well, for I am a good judge. Canst thou sing me a jovial song?" Philip saw that his companion was of high rank and a little tipsy, and answered-"I sing better over a glass of wine in a warm room, than when up to, my waist in -snow." They had now reached Mary street, and Philip sang, and blew the horn. "Ha! that's but a poor performance," exclaimed the mask, who had accompanied him thither. "Give me the horn! I shall blow so well that you'll half die with delight." Philip yielded to the mask's wishes, and let him sing the : verses and blow. For four or five times all was done as if the stranger had been a watchman all his life. He dilated most eloquently on the jays of such an occupation, and was 4 ;  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7943-00000037"/> 74         (#r-mas t tomr. so inexhaustible in his own praises, that he made Philip laugh at his extravagance. His spirits evidently owed no small share of their elevation to an extra glass of wine. "I'll tell you what, my treasure, I've a great fancy to be a watchman myself for an hour or two. If I don't do it now, I shall never arrive at that honor in the course of my  life. Give me your greatcoat and wide-brimmed hat, and take my domino. Go into a beer-house and take a bottle at my expense; and when you have finished it, come again 'and give me back my masking-gear. You shall have a couple of dollars for your trouble. What do you think, my treasure?" But Philip did not like this arrangement. At last, -how- ever, at the solicitations of the mask, he capitulated as they entered a dark lane. Philip was half frozen; a warm drink would do him good, and so would a warm fire. He agreed for one half-hour to give up his watchmanship, which would be till twelve o'clock. Exactly at that time the stranger was to come to the great door of St. Gregory's and give back the greatcoat, horn, and staff, taking back his own silk mantle, hat, and domino. Philip also told him the four streets in which he was to call the hour. The mask was in raptures: "Treasure of my heart, I could kiss thee if thou wert not a dirty miserable fellow! But thou shalt have naught to regret if thou art at the church at twelve, for I will give thee money for a supper then. Joy! I am a watchman!"The mask looked a watchman to the life, while -Philip was completely disguised with the half-mask tied over his face, the bonnet ornamented with a buckle of brilliants on his head, and the red silk mantle thrown around him. When he saw his companion co'mmence his walk, he began to fear that the young gentleman might compromise the dignity of the watchman. He therefore addressed him once more, and said: "I hope you will not abuse my good-nature and do any   mischief, or misbehave in any way, as it may cost me the situation." "Hallo'!" answered the stranger. "What are you talking about? Do you think I don't know my duty? Off with you this moment, or I'll let you feel the weight of my staff. But come to St. Gregory's church and give me back my clothes at twelve o'clock. Good-bye. This is glorious fun!", The new guardian of the streets walked onward with all the dignity becoming his office, while Philip hurried to a neighboring tavern. As he was passing the door of the Royal palace he was laid hold of by a person in a mask who had alighted from a carriage. Philip turned round, and in a low whispering voice asked what the stranger wanted. "My   gracious lord," answered the mask, "in your reverie you have passed the door. Will your Royal High- ness    "  "What? Royal Highness?" said Philip, laughing. "I am no highness. What put that in your head?", The mask bowed respectfully, and pointed to the bril- liant buckle in Philip's hat. "I ask your pardon if I have betrayed your disguise. But whatever character you may assume, your noble bearing will betray you. Will you con- descend to lead the way? Does your Highness intend to dance?" "I?  To dance?", replied Philip. "No- you, see I have boots on." "To play, then?', inquired the mask. "Still less. I have brought no money with me," said the assistant watchman. "Good heaven!, exclaimed the mask. "Command my purse-all that I  possess is at your service!" Saying this, he forced a fill purse into Philip's hand.  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7943-00000038"/> 76         A pstmss ftritt. "But do you know who I am?" inquired Philip, and rejected the purse. The mask whispered with a bow of profound obedience -"His Royal Highness, Prince Julian." At this moment Philip heard his deputy in an adjoining street calling the hour very distinctly, and he now became aware of his metamorphosis. Prince Julian, who was well known in the capital as an amiable, wild, and good-hearted young man, had been the person with whom he had changed his clothes. "Now, then," thought Philip, "as he enacts the watchman so well, I will not shame his rank; I'll see if, for one half hour, I can't be the prince. If I make any mistake, he has himself to blame for it." He wrapped the red silken mantle closer round him, took the offered purse, put it in his pocket, and said,-"Who are you, mask? I will return your gold to-morrow." "I am the Chamberlain Pilzou." "Good-lead the way--I'll follow." The chamberlain obeyed, and tripped up the marble stairs, Philip coming close behind him. They entered an immense hall lighted by a thousand tapers and dazzling chandeliers, which were reflected by brilliant mirrors. A confused crowd of mask- ers jostledeach other-sultans, Tyrolese, harlequins, knights in armor, nuns, goddesses, satyrs, monks, Jews, Medes, and Persians. Philip for a while was abashed and blinded. Such splendor he had never dreamt of. In the middle of the hall the dance was carried on by hundreds of people to the music of a full band. Philip, whom the heat of the apartment recovered from his frozen state, was so bewildered with the scene that he could scarcely nod his head as different fAasks addressed him, some ,confidentially, others deferentially. "Will you go to the hazard table?" whispered the Chamberlain, who stood beside him, and who Philip now saw was dressed as a Brahmin.   "s Let me get unthawed first," answered Philip; "I am an icicle at present." "A glass of warm punch?" inquired the Brahmin, and led him into the refreshment-room. The pseudo-prince did not wait for a second invitation, but emptied one glass after the other in short time. The punch was good, and it spread its genial warmth through Philip's veins. "How is it you don't dance to-night, Brahmin?" he asked of his companion, when they returned into the hall. The Brahmin sighed, and shrugged his shoulders. "I have no pleasure now in the dance. Gaiety is dis- tasteful to me. The only person I care to dance with-the Countess Bonau-I thought she loved me; our families offered no objection--but all at once she broke with me." His voice trembled as he spoke. "How?"  said Philip, "I never heard of such a thing." "You never heard of it?" repeated the other, "the whole city rings with it. The quarrel-happened a fortnight ago, and she will not allow me to justify myself, but has sent back three letters I wrote to her, unopened. She is a declared enemy of the Baroness Reizenthal, and had made me promise to drop her acquaintance. But, think how unfortunate I was! When the Queen-mother made the hunting party to Freudenwald, she appointed me cavalier to the Baroness. What could I do? It was impossible to refuse. On the very birthday of the adorable Bonau I was obliged to set out ....  She heard of it. ...- She put no trust in my heart!"          X "Well, then, -Brahmin, take advantage of the present moment. The new year makes up all quarrels. Is the Countess here?" - Do you not see her over there-the Carmelite on the left of the third pillar beside the two black dominoes? She  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7943-00000039"/> 78        dftstmas Sfioris. has laid aside her mask. Ah, Princel your intercession would  " Philip thought-now I can do a good work! and, as the punch had inspired him, he walked directly to the Carmelite. The Countess- Bonau looked at him for some time seriously, and with flushed cheeks, as he sat down beside her. She was a beautiful girl; yet Philip remained persuaded that Rose was a thousand times more beau- tiful. "Countess,' he said-and became embarrassed when he met her clear bright eye fixed upon him. "Prince," said the Countess, " an hour ago you were somewhat too bold." "Fair Countess, I am therefore at this present moment the more quiet." "So much the better. I shall not, then, be obliged to keep out of your way." "Fair lady, allow me to ask one question. Have you put on a nun's gown to do penance for your sins?" "I have nothing to do penance for." "But you have, Countess!--your cruelties-your in- justice to the poor Brahmin yonder, who seems neglected by his God and all the world!" The beautiful Carmelite cast down her eyes, and appeared uneasy.       - "And do you know, fair Countess, that in the Freuden- wald affair the Chamberlain is as innocent as I am?" "As you, Prince?" said the Countess, frowning,- "what did you tell me an hour ago?" "You are right, dear Countess, I was too bold. You said so yourself. But now I declare to you the Chamber- lain was obliged to go to Freudenwald by command of the Queen-mother-against his will-was obliged to be "cavalier to the hated Reizenthal "   jt Ighbentmtres of a gef-cr1e's fQe.            7r  "Hated-by him?"--interrupted the Countess with a bitter and sneering laugh. "Yes-he hates,-he despises the Baroness. Believe me, he scarcely treated her with civility, and incurred the Royal displeasure by so doing. I know it; and it was for your sake. You are the only person he loves- to you he offers his hand, his heart--and you!-you reject him! , "How comes it, Prince, that you intercede so warmly for Pilzou? You did not do so formerly." "That was because I did not know him, and still less the sad state into which you have thrown him by your behavior. I swear to you he is innocent-you have nothing to forgive in him--he has much to forgive in you." -"Hush!" whispered the Carmelite, "we are watched here; away fromn this." She replaced her mask, stood up, and placing her arm within that of the supposed Prince, they crossed the hall and entered a side-room. The Count- ess uttered many bitter complaints against the Chamberlain, but they were the complaints of jealous love. The Count- ess was in tears, when the tender Brahmin soon after came timidly into the apartment. There was a deep silence among the three. Philip, not knowing how to conclude his intercession better,-led the Brahmin to the Carmelite, and joined their- hands together, without saying a word, and left them to fate. He himself returned into the hall. Here he was hastily addressed by a Mameluke--"I'm glad I have met you, Domino. Is the Rose-girl in -the side-room?" The Mameluke rushed into it, but returned in a moment evidently disappointed. LOne word alone with you, Doming," he said, and led Philip into a window recess in a retired part of the hall. , "V What do you want?" asked Philip. "I beseech you," replied the Mameluke, in a subdued yet terrible voice, " wher'e is the Rose-girl?"  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7943-00000040"/> 80    -st-ma fitorm-. "What is the Rose-girl to me?" "But to me she is everything!" answered the Mame- luke, whose suppressed voice and agitated demeanor showed that a fearful struggle was going on within. "To me she is everything. She is my wife. You make me wretched, Prince! I conjure you drive me not to madness. Think of my wife no more!" "With all my heart," answered Philip, drily; " what have I to do with your wife?" "Oh, Prince, Prince!" exclaimed the Mameluke, "I have made a resolve which I shall execute if it cost me my life. Do not seek to deceive me a moment longer. I have discovered everything. Here! look at this! 'tis a note my false wife slipt into your hand, and which you dropt in the crowd, without having read." Philip took the note. 'Twas written in pencil, and in a fine delicate hand--"Change your mask. Everybody knows you. My husband watches you. He does not know me. If you obey me I will reward you." "Hem!" muttered Philip. "As I live, this was not written to me. I don't trouble my head about your wife." "Death and fury, Prince! do not drive me mad! Do you know who it is that speaks to you? I am the Marshal Blankenswerd. Your advances to. my wife are -not un- known to me, ever since the last rout at the palace." "My Lord Marshal,"5 answered Philip, "excuse me for saying that jealousy has blinded you. If you knew me well, you would not think of accusing me of such folly. I give you my word of honor I will never trouble your wife." "Are you in earnest, Prince?"5 "Entirely." "Give me a- proof of this." "Whatever you require."' "I know you have hindered her until now from going    with me to visit her relations in Poland. Will you per- suade her to do so now?" "With all my heart, if you desire it." "Yes, yes! and your Royal Highness will prevent in- conceivable and unavoidable misery." The Mameluke continued for some time, sometimes begging and praying, and sometimes threatening so furi- ously, that Philip feared he might make a scene before the whole assembly that would not have suited him precisely. He, therefore, quitted -him as soon as possible. Scarcely llad he lost himself in the crowd, when a female, closely wrapped in deep mourning, tapped him familiarly on thle arm, and whispered: "Butterfly, whither away? Have you no pity for the disconsolate Widow?"' Philip answered very politely, "Beautiful widows find no lack of comforters. May I venture to include myself amongst them?" "Why are you so disobedient? and why have you not changed your mask?" said the Widow, while she led him aside, that he might speak more freely. "Do you really fancy, Prince, that every one here does not know who you are?" "They are very much mistaken in me, I assure you," replied Philip. "No, indeed," answered the Widow, " they know you very well, and if you do not immediately change your apparel, I shall not speak to you again the whole evening: I have no desire to give my husband an opportuntmity of making a scene." By this Philip discovered who he was talking with. "You were the beautiful Rose-girl; are your roses withered so soon?" 'What is there that does not wither? Not the con- 4* &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7943-00000041"/> 82         midmas Sorte. stancy of man? I saw you when you slipt off with the Carmelite. Acknowledge your inconstancy-you can deny it no longer." "Hem,"-answered Philip drily, "accuse me if you will, I can return the accusation." "How,-pretty butterfly?" "Why, for instance, there is not a more constant man alive than the Marshal."5 "There is not indeed!-and I am wrong, very wrong, to have listened to you so long. I reproached myself enough, but he has unfortunately discovered our flirtation." "Since the last rout at Court, fair Widow "- "Where you were so unguarded and particular--pretty butterfly!" "Let us repair the mischief. Let us part. I honor the Marshal, and, for my part, do not like to give him pain." The Widow looked at him for some time -in speechless amazement. "If you have indeed any regard for me," continued Phi- lip, ' you will go with the Marshal to Poland, to visit your relations. 'Tis better that we should not meet so often. A beautiful woman is beautiful-but a pure and virtuous woman is more beautiful still." "Prince!" cried the astonished Widow, "are you really in earnest? Have you ever loved me, or have you all along deceived?"  "Look you," answered Philip, "I am a tempter of a peculiar kind." I search constantly among women to find truth and virtue, and 'tis but seldom that I encounter them. Only the true and virtuous-can keep me constant-therefore I am true to none; but no! I will not lie-there is one that keeps me in her chains-I am sorry, fair Widow, that that one-is not you!" "You are in a strange mood to-night, Prince," answered   the Widow, and the trembling of her voice and heaving of her bosom showed the working of her mind. a"No," answered Philip, ' I am in as rational a mood to- night as I ever was in my life. I wish only to repair an injury; I have promised to your husband to do so." "How!" exclaimed the Widow, in a voice of terror, "you have discovered all to the Marshal?" "Not everything," answered Philip, " only what I. knew."  The widow wrung her hands in the extremity of agita- tion, and at last said, "Where is my husband?"5 Philip pointed to the Mameluke, who at this moment approached them with slow steps. "Prince," said the Widow, in a tone of inexpressible rage,--"Prince,-you may be forgiven this, but not from me! I never dreamt that the heart of man could be so deceit- ful,-but you are unworthy of a thought. You are an impos- tor! My-husband in the dress of a barbarian is a prince; you in the dress of a prince are a barbarian. In this world you see me no more!"            L. With these words she turned proudly away from him, and going up to the Mameluke, they left the hall in deep and earnest conversation. Philip laughed quietly, and said to himself, "My substitute, the watchman, must look to it, for I do not play my part badly; I only hope when he returns he will proceed as I have begun." He went up to the dancers, and was delighted to see the beautiful Carmelite standing up in a set with the overjoyed Brahmin. No sooner did the latter perceive him, than he kissed his hand to him, and in dumb show gave him to under- stand in what a blessed state he was. Philip thought, "T'is a pity I am not to be prince all my lifetime. The people would be satisfied then: to be a prince is the easiest thing in the world. He can do more with a single word than a &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7943-00000042"/> 84         firotmas iftorie. lawyer with a four hours' speech. Yes! if I were a prince, my beautiful Rose would be-lost to me for ever. No! I would not be a Prince." He now looked at the clock, and saw 'twas half past eleven. The Mameluke hurried up to him and gave him a paper. "' Prince," he exclaimed, "I could fall at your feet and thank you in the very dust; I am reconciled to my wife. You have broken her heart, but it is better that it should be so. We leave for Poland this very night, and there we shall fix our home. Farewell! I shall be ready whenever your Royal Highness requires me, to pour out my last drop of blood in your service. My grati- tude is- eternal. Farewell!" "Stay!" said Philip to the Marshal, who was hurrying away, " what am I to do with this paper?" "Oh, that,--'tis the amount of my loss to your High- ness last week at hazard. I had nearly forgotten it; but before my departure, I must clear my debts. I have en- dorsed it.-on the back." With these words the Marshal -disappeared. Philip opened the paper, and read in it an order for five thousand dollars. He put it in his pocket, and thought, "Well, it's a pity that I'm not a. prince."  Some one whis- pered in his ear- "Your Royal Highness, we are both discovered; I shall blow my brains out." Philip turned round in amazement, and saw a negro at his side. "What do you want, mask?" he asked, in an uncon- cerned tone. "I am C olonel Kalt," whispered the negro. "The Marshal's wife has been chattering to Duke Herman, and he has been breathing fire and fury against us both." l He is quite welcome," answered Philip. 'But the King will hear it all,?' sighed the negro,   "This very night I may be arrested and carried to a dun- geon; I'll sooner hang myself." "No need of that," said Philip. "What! am I to be made infamous for my whole life? I am lost, I tell you. The Duke will demand entire satis- faction. His back is black and blue yet with the marks of the cudgelling I gave him. I am lost, and the baker's daughter too! I'll jump from the bridge and drown my- self at once!" "God forbid!" answered Philip; "what have you and the baker's daughter to do with it?" "Your Royal Highness banters me, and I am in de- spair!-I humbly beseech you to give me two minutes' private conversation." Philip followed the negro into a small boudoir dimly lighted up with a few candles. The negro threw himself on the sofa, quite overcome, and groaned aloud. Philip found some sandwiches and wine on the table, and helped himself with great relish. "I wonder your Royal Highness can be so cool on hear- ing this cursed story. If that rascally Salmoni was here who acted the conjuror, hle might save us by some contri- vance, for the fellow was a bunch of tricks. As it is, he has slipped out of the scrape." "So much the better," interrupted Philip, replenishing his glass; " since he has got out of the way, we can throw all the blame on hIsshoulders." "How can we do that? - The Duke, I tell you, knows that you, and I, and the Marshal's wife, and the baker's daughter, were all in the plot together, to take advantage of his superstition. He knows that it was you that En- gaged Salmoni to play the conjuror; that it was r that instructed the baker's daughter (with whom he is in love) how to inveigle him into the snare; that it was I that   &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7943-00000043"/> 86        $^nstmw Fotes+g enacted the ghost that knocked him down, and cudgelled him till he roared again. If I had only not carried the joke too far, but I wished to cool his love a little for my sweetheart. 'Twas a devilish business.  I'll take poison." "Rather swallow a glass of wine-'Tis delicious," said Philip, taking another tart at the same time. "For to tell you the truth, my friend, I think you are rather a white- livered sort of a rogue for a colonel, to think of hanging, drowning, shooting, and poisoning yourself about such a ridiculous story as that. One of these modes would be too much, but as to all the four-nonsense. I tell you that at this moment I don't know what to make out of your tale." "Your Royal Highness have pity on me, my brain is turned.   The Duke's page, an old friend of mine, has told me this very moment, that the Marshal's wife, inspired by the devil, went up to the Duke, and told him that the trick- played on him at the baker's house, was planned by Prince Julian, who opposed his marriage with his sister; that the spirit he saw was myself; sent by the Princess to be a witness of his superstition; that your Highness was a witness of his descent into the pit after hidden gold, and of his promise to make the baker's daughter his mistress, and also to make her one of the nobility immediately after his marriage with the Princess. 'Do not hope to gain the Princess. It is useless for you to try!' were the last words of the Marshal's wife to the Duke." "And a pretty story it is," muttered Philip; "why, behavior like that would be a disgrace to the meanest of the people. I declare there is no end to these deviltries." "Yes, indeed. 'Tis impossible to behave more meanly than the Marshal's lady. The woman must be a fiury. My gracious lord, save me from destruction."    "Where is the Duke?" asked Philip. - "The page told me he started up on hearing the story, and said, ' I will go to the King.' And if he tells the story to the King in his own way--" "Is the King here, then?" "Oh yes, he is at play in the next room with the Arch- bishop and the Minister of Police." Philip walked with long steps through the boudoir. The case required consideration. "Your Royal Highness," said the negro, " protect me. Your own honor is at stake. You can easily make all straight; otherwise, I am ready, at the first intimation of danger, to fly across the border. I will pack up, and,.to- morrow I shall expect your last commands as to my future behavior." With these words the negro took his leave. It is high time I were a watchman again," thought Philip. "I am getting both myself and my substitute into scrapes he will find it hard to get out of-and this makes the difference between a peasant and a prince. One is no better off than the other. Good heavens! what stupid things these court lords are doing, which we do not dream of with our lanterns and staff in hand, or when at the spade! We think they lead the lives of angels without sin or care. Pretty piece of business! Within a quarter of an hour I have heard of more rascally tricks than I ever played in my whole life. And "--but his reverie was interrupted by a whisper.              - "So lonely, Prince! I consider myself happy in having a minute's conversation with your Royal Highness." Philip looked at the speaker; and he was a Miner, covered over with gold and jewels. "But one instant," said the mask. "The business is pressing, and deeply concerns you."  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7943-00000044"/> 88         Cbxtmtmw itotar. "Who are you?" inquired Philip. "Count Bodenlos, the Minister of Finance, at your Highness's service," answered the Miner, and showed his face, which looked as if it were a second mask with its little eyes and copper-colored nose. "Well then, my lord, what is the pressing matter which you wish to communicate?" "May I speak openly? I waited on your Royal High- ness thrice, and was never admitted to the honor of an audience; and yet-Heaven is my witness-no man in all this court has a deeper interest in your Royal Highness than I have." "I am greatly obliged to you," replied Philip; "what is your business just now? But be quick." "May I venture to speak of the house of Abraham Levi?" "As much as you like." "They have applied to me about the fifty thousand dollars which you owe them, and threaten to apply to the King. And you remember your promise to his Majesty when last he paid your debts." "Can't the people wait?" asked Philip. "No more than the Brothers, goldsmiths, who demand their seventy-five thousand dollars." "It is all one to me. If the people wont wait for their money, I must" "No hasty resolutions, my gracious Lord! I have it in my power to make everything comfortable, if" "Well, if what?" "If you will honor me by listening to me one moment. I hope to have no difficulty in redeeming all your debts. The house of Abraham Levi has bought up immense quan- tities of wheat, so that the price is very much raised. A de- cree against importation will raise it three or four per cent.   ^baentots of a Sb-fear's (6eo.    89 higher. By giving Abraham Levi the monopoly the busi- ness will be arranged. The house erases your debt, and pays off your seventy-five thousand dollars to the goldsmiths, and I give you over the receipts. But everything depends on my continuing for another year at the head of the Finance. If Baron Griefensack succeeds in ejecting me from the Ministry, I shall be unable to serve your Royal Highness as I could wish. If your Highness will leave the party of Griefensack, our point is gained. For me it is a matter of perfect indifference whether I remain in office or not. I sigh for repose. But for your Royal Highness it is a mat- ter of great moment. If I have not the mixing of the pack, I lose the game." Philip for some time did not know what answer to make. At last, while the Finance Minister, in expectation of his reply, took a pinch out of his snuff-box set with jewels, Philip said- "If I rightly understand you, Sir Count, you would starve the country a little in order to pay my debts.

When the price of wheat rises, the King will, of course, think of permitting importation, and prevent ex- portation by heavy imposts. The permission to do so is given to the house of Abraham Levi, and they export as much as they choose. But, as I paid before, if Griefensack gets the helm, nothing can be done. For the first year he would be obliged to attend strictly to his duty, in order to be able afterwards to feather his nest at the expense of the country. He must first make sure of his ground. He is dreadfully grasping!"

Already they scarcely know how to pay their rates and taxes. You should treat us with a little more consideration, Count." 1"Us!-don't I do everything for the Court?" "No! I mean the people. You should have a little more consideration for them." "I appreciate what your Royal Highness says; but I serve the King and the court, the people are not to be con- sidered. The country is his private property, and the people are only useful to him as increasing the value of his land. But this is no time to discuss the old story about the inte- rests of the people. I beg your Royal Highness's answer to my propositions. Shall I have the honor to discharge your debts on the above specified conditions?" c' Answer,-no-never, never! at the expense of hun- dreds and thousands of starving families." "But, your Royal Highness, if in addition to the clear- ance of your debts, I make the house of Abraham Levi pre- sent you with fifty thousand dollars in hard cash.

I shall have the honor to present your Royal High- ness with a receipt for all your debts, besides the gift of lifty thousand dollars." "Go, I want to hear no more of it." "And your Royal Highness will honor me with your favor?

I tell you what, unless you lower the price of corn, and take away the monopoly from that infernal Jew, I'll go this moment and reveal your villany to the King, and get you and Abraham Levi banished from the country. See to it--I'll keep my word!"Philip turned away in a rage, and proceeded into the dancing-room, leaving the Minister of Finance petrified with amazement. "When does your Royal Highness require the car- riage?" whispered a stout little Dutch merchant in a bob-wig. "Not at all," answered Philip. "'Tis after half-past eleven, and the beautiful singer expects you. She will tire of waiting." "Let her sing something to cheer her." "How, Prince? Have you changed your mind? Would you- leave the captivating Rollina in the lurch, and throw away the golden opportunity you have been sighing for,  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7943-00000046"/> 92        C;riitm^ itte. for two months? The letter you sent to-day, inclosing the diamond watch, did wonders.  The proud but fragile beauty surrenders. This morning you were in raptures, and now you are as cold as ice! What is the cause of the change?" "That is my business, not yours," said Philip. "I had your orders to join you at half-past eleven. Perhaps you have other engagements?? "Perhaps." "A petit soup2er with the Countess Born? She is not present here; at least amnong all the masks I can't trace her out. I shouldknow her among a thousand by that graceful walk, and her peculiar way of carrying her little head-eh, Prince?" "Well, but if it were so, there would be no necessity for making you my confidant, would there?" "I will take the hint, and be silent. But wont you at any rate send to the Signora Rollina to let her know you are not coming.;' "If I have sighed for her two months, she had better sigh a month or two for me. I shan't go near her." "So that beautiful necklace which you sent her for a New Year's present was all for nothing?" "As far as I am concerned." "Will you break with her entirely?" "There is nothing between us to break, that I know of." "Well, then, since you speak so plainly, I will tell you something which you perhaps know already. Your love to the Signora has hitherto kept me silent; but now that you have -altered your Eind about her, I can no longer keep the secret from you E You are deceived." "By whom?" "By the artful singer. She would divide her favors between your Royal Highness and a Jew."    "A Jew!" "Yes! with the son of Abraham Levi." "Is that rascal everywhere?" "So, your Highness did not know it; but I am telling you the exact truth; were it not for your Royal Highness, she would be his mistress. I am only sorry you gave her that watch." "I don't regret it at all." "The jade deserves to be Whipped." "Few people meet their deserts," answered Philip. "Too true, too true, your Royal Highness. For in- stance, I have discovered a girl--oh, Prince, there is not such another in this city or in the whole world! Few have seen this angel-Pooh! Rollina is nothing to her. Listen -a girl tall and slender as a palm-tree-with a complexion like the red glow of evening upon snow-eyes like sun- beams-rich golden tresses-in short, the most beautiful creature I ever beheld-a Venus-a goddess in rustic attire. Your Highness must give her chase." "A peasant girl?"- "A mere rustic; but then you must see her yourself, and you will love her. But my descriptions are nothing. Imagine the embodiment of all that you can conceive most charming-add to that, artlessness, grace, and innocence. But the difficulty is to catch sight of her. She seldom leaves her mother. I know her seat in church, and have watched her for many Sundays past, as she walked with her mother to the Elm-Gate. I have ascertained that a handsome young fellow, a gardener, is making court to her. He can't marry her, for he is a poor devil, and she has no- thing. The mother is the widow of a poor weaver." 'c And the mother's name is--?" "Widow Bittner, in Milk street; and the daughter, fairest-of flowers, is, in fact, called Rose."  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7943-00000047"/> Philip's blood boiled at the sound of the beloved name. His first inclination was to knock the communicative Dutchman down. He restrained himself, however, and only asked- "Are you the devil himself?" "'Tis good news, is it not? I have taken some steps in the matter already, but you must see her first. Perhaps such a pearl has not altogether escaped your keen observa- tion? Do you know her?". "Intimately." "So much the better. Have I been too- lavish of my praises? You confess their truth? She shan't escape us. We must go together to the widow; you must play the philanthropist. You have heard of the widow's poverty, and must insist on relieving it. You take an interest in the good woman; enter into her misfortunes; leave a small present at each visit, and by this means become acquainted with Rose. The rest follows of course. The gardener can be easily got out of the way, or perhaps a doze? or two of dollars slipt quietly into his hand may"--  Philip's rage broke forth. "I'll throttle you" "If the gardener makes a fuss?" interposed the Dutch- man. "Leave me to settle this matter. I'll get him kid- napped, and sent to the army to fight for his country. In the meantime, you get possession of the field; for the girl has a peasant's attachment for the fellow, and it will not be easy to get the nonsense out of her head, which she has been taught by 'the canaille. But I will give her some lessons, and then"- "Ill break your neck." "'Your Highness is too good. But if your Higlmness would use your interest with the King to procure me the Chamberlain's key"   Abbzltfurts of a 3efo-gzar^ (be.  95 "I wish I could procure yot'" "Oh, don't flatter me, your Highness. Had I only known you thought so much of her beauty, she would have been yours long ago." "'Not a word more," cried the enraged Philip, in a smothered voice; for he dared not speak aloud, he was so surrounded by maskers, who were listening, dancing, talk- ing, as they passed him, and he might have betrayed him- self: " not a word more!" "No, there will be more than words. Deeds shall show my sincerity. You may advance. You are wont to conquer. The outposts will be easily taken. The gardener I will manage, and the mother will range herself under your gilded banners. Then the fortress will be won!" "Sir, if you venture," said Philip, who now could hardly contain himself. It was with great difficulty he re- frained from open violence, and he clutched the arm of the Dutchman with the force of a vice. "Your Highness, for Heaven's sake, moderate your joy. I shall scream-you are mashing my arm!" "If you venture to go near that innocent girl, I will demolish every bone in your body." "Good, good," screamed the Dutchman, in intense pain; " only let go my arm." "If I find you anywhere near Milk street, I'll dash your miserable brains out. So look to it." The Dutchman seemed almost stupefied; trembling he said- "May it please your Highness, I could not imagine you really loved the girl as it seems you do." "I love her! I will own it before the whole world!" "And are loved in return?" "That's none of your business. Never mention her name to me again. Do not even think of her, it would be  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7943-00000048"/> 96        bgristmoas toiet. a stain upon her purity. Now you know what I think. Be off.), Philip twirled the unfortunate Dutchman round as he let go his arm, and that worthy gentleman slunk out of the hall. Inr the meantime Philip's substitute supported his cha- racter of watchman on the snow-covered streets. It is scarcely necessary to say, that this was none other than Prince Julian, who had taken a notion to join the watch- his head being crazed by the fire, of the sweet wine. He attended to the directions left by Philip, and went his rounds, and called the hour with great decorum, except that, instead of the usual watchman's verses, he favored the public with rhymes of his own. He was cogitating a new stanza, when the door of a house beside him opened, and a well wrapped up girl beckoned to him, and ran into ' the shadow of the house. -The Prince left his stanza half finished, and followed the apparition. A soft hand grasped his in the darkness, and a voice whispered-- "Good evening, dear Philip. Speak low, that nobody may hear us. I have only got away from the company for one moment, to speak to you as you passed. Are you happy to see me?" "Blest -as a god, my angel;-who could be otherwise than happy by thy side?" "I've some good news for you, Philip. You must sup at our house to-morrow evening. My mother has allowed me to ask you. You'll come?" "For the whole evening, and as many more as you wish. Would we might be together till the end of the world-! 'Twould be a life fit for gods i" "Listen, Philip; in half an hour I shall be at St. Gre- gory's. I  shall expect you there. You won't fail me? Don't keep me waiting long--we shall have a walk to-   Mbitcnfs of a (6o-Rear's Afi    97 -gether. Go now-we may be discovered!"She tried to go, but Julian held her back and threw his arms round her. "What, wilt thou leave me so coldly?" he said, and tried to press a kiss upon her lips. Rose did not know what to think of this boldness, for Philip had always been modest, and never dared more than kiss her hand, except once, when her mother had for- bidden their meeting again. They had then exchanged their first kiss in great sorrow and in great love, but never since then. She struggled to free herself, but Julian held her firm, till at last she had to buy her liberty by submit- ting to the kiss, and begged him to go. Julian seemed not at all inclined to move. "What! go? I'm not such a fool as that comes to! You think I love my horn better than you? No, indeed!" "But, then, it isn't right, Philip." "Not right? why not, my beauty? there is nothing against kissing in the ten commandments." "Why, if we could marry, perhaps you might--but you know very well we can't marry, and " "Not marry! why not? You can marry me any day you like." "Philip!-why will you talk such folly? You know we must not think of such a thing." "But I think very seriously about it-if you would consent.'" "You are unkind to speak thus. Ah, Philip, I had a dream last night." "A dream-what was it?" "You had won a prize in the lottery; we were:both so happy! You ihd bought a beautiful garden, handsomer than any in the city. It was a little Paradise of flowers-and thee Were ere large beds of vegetables, and the trees were laden with fruit. And when I awoke, Philip, I felt so wretchedl-- ;  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7943-00000049"/> 98        d;t#gism Sitori. I wished I had not dreamed such a happy dream. You've nothing in the lottery, Philip, have you? Have you really won anything? The drawing took place to-day." "How much must I have gained to win you too?" "Ah, Philip, if you had only gained a thousand dollars, you might buy such a pretty garden!" "A thousand dollars! Arld what if it were more?" "Ah, Philip-what? is it true? is it really? Don't deceive me! 'twill be worse than the dream. You had a ticket! and you've won! own it! own it!" "All you can wish for." Rose flung her arms around his neck in the extremity of her joy, and kissed him. "More than the thousand dollars? And will they pay you the whole?" Her kiss made the Prince forget to answer. It was so strange to hold a pretty form in his arms, receive its caress- es, and to know they were not meant for him. "Answer me, answer me!" cried Rose, impatiently. "Will they give you all that money!" "They've done it already--and if it will add to your happiness, I will hand it to you this moment." ' What! have you got it with you?"9 The Prince took out his purse, which he had filled with money in expectation of some play. "Take it and weigh it, my girl," he said, placing it in her hand and kissing her again. "This then makes you mine!" "Oh, not this--nor all the gold in the world, if you were not my own dear Philip!" "And how if I had given you twice as much as all this money, and yet were not your own dear Philip?' "I would fling the purse at your feet, and make you a very polite curtsey," said Rose. A door now opened.; the light streamed down upon the   ibbtuntuts of a ^fo-ax' Abe.    99 steps, and the laughing voices of girls were heard. Rose whispered- "In half an hour, at St. Gregory's," and ran up the steps, leaving the Prince in the darkness. Disconcerted by the suddenness of the parting, and his curiosity excited by his ignorance of the name of his new acquaintance, and not even having had a full view of her face, he consoled him- self with the rendezvous at St. Gregory's church door. This he resolved to keep, though it was evident that all the tenderness which had been bestowed on him was intended for his friend the watchman. The interview with Rose, or the coldness of the night, increased the effect of the wine to such an extent that the mischievous propensities of the young Prince got the upper hand of him. Standing amidst a crowd of people, in the middle of the street, he blew so lustily on his horn that the women screamed, and the men gasped with fear. He called tile hour, and then shouted, at the top of his lungs- The business of our lovely state Is stricken by the hand of fate- Even our maids, both light and brown, Can find no sale in all the town; They deck themselves with all their arts, But no one buys their worn-out hearts. "Shame! shame!" cried several female voi s from the window at the end of this complimentary effusion, which, however, was crowned with a loud laugh from the men. "Bravo, watchman," cried some; " encore! encore!" shouted others. "How dare you, fellow, insult ladies in the open street?" growled a young lieutenant, who had a very pretty girl on his arm. "Mr. Lieutenant," answered'a miller, ".unfortunately watchmen always tell the truth, and the lady on your arm is a proof of it. Ha! young jade, do you know me? do  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7943-00000050"/> 100        xriatma Sorion'e you know who I am? Is it right for a betrothed bride to be gadding at night about the streets with other men? To- morrow your mother shall hear of this. I'll have nothing more to do with you!" The girl hid her face, and nudged the young officer to lead her away. But the lieutenant, like a brave soldier, scorned to retreat from the miller, and determined to keep the field. He therefore made use of a full round of oaths, which were returned with interest, and a sabre was final- ly resorted to, with some flourishes ; but two Spanish cud- gels were threateningly held over the head of the lieutenant by a couple of stout townsmen, while one of them, who was a broad-shouldered beer-brewer, cried--"Don't -make any more fuss about the piece of goods beside you-she ain't worth it. The miller's a good fellow, and what he says is true, and the watchman's right, too. A plain tradesman can hardly venture to marry now. All the women wish to marry above their station. Instead-of darning stockings, they read romances--instead of working in the kitchen, they run after comedies and concerts. Their houses are dirty, and they are walking out, dressed like princesses: all they bring a husband as a dowry, are handsome dresses, lace ribbons, intrigues, romances, and idleness! Sir, I speak from experience; I should have married long since, if girls were not spoilt." The spectators laughed heartily, and the lieutenant slowly put back his sword, saying peevishy, '"It is a little too much to be obliged to hear a sermon from the canaille.") "What! Canaille!" cried a smith, who held the second  cudgel. "Do you call those canaille who feed you noble idlers by duties and taxes? :Your licentiousness is the cause of our domestic discords, and noble ladies would not have so much cause to mourn if you had learned both to pray and to work."   gCbetntue s of a gefa-gents 6be.   ]01 Several young officers had gathered together already, and so had some mechanics; and the boys, in the mean- time, threw snowhalls among both parties, that their share in the fun might riot be lost. The first ball hit the noble lieutenant on the nose, and thinking it an attack from the canaille, he raised his sabre. The fight began. The Prince, who had laughed amazingly at the first commencement of the uproar, had betaken himself to another region, and felt quite unconcerned as to the result. In the course of his wanderings, he came to the palace of Count Bodenlos, the Minister of Finance, with whom, as Philip had discovered at the masquerade, the Prince was not on the best terms. The Countess had a large party. Julian saw the lighted windows, and still feeling poetically disposed, he planted himself opposite the balcony, and blew a peal onl his horn. Several ladies and gentlemen opened the shutters, because they had nothing better to do, and listened to what he should say. "Watchman," cried one of them, " sing us a New Year's greeting!" This invitation brought a fresh accession of the Countess's party to the windows. Julian called the hour in the usual manner, and sang,loud enough to be distinctly heard inside- Ye who groan with heavy debts, And swift approaching failure frets, Pray the Lord that he this hour May raise you to s6me place of power; And while the nation wants and suffers, Fill your own from the people's coffers. "Outrageous!" screamed the lady of the minister- "who is the iisolent wretch that dares such an insult?" "'Pleashe your exshellenshy," answered Julian, imitat- ing the Jewish dialect in voice and manner, "I vash only intcndish to shing you a pretty shong.

'Your ladyship knowsh me ver' well.1" "' How dare you tell- such a lie, you villain?!" exclaimed a voice, trembling with rage, at one of the windows- "how dare you say you are Abraham Levi? I am Abra- ham Levi! Yotu are a cheat."- is Call the police!" cried the Countess! Z Have that man arrested!" At these words the party confusedly withdrew from the windows. Nor did the Prince venture to remain where he was, but quickly effected his escape through a cross street. A crowd of servants rushed out of the palace, led by the Secretaries of the Finance, and commenced a search for the offender. "We have him!" cried some, as the rest eagerly approached. It was in fact the real guardian of the night, who was carefully perambulating his beat, in innocent unconsciousness of any offence. In spite of all he could say, he was disarmed and carried off to the watch- house, and charged with causing a disturbance by singing libellous songs. The officer of the police shook his head at the unaccountable event, and said,--"We have already one watchman in custody, whose verses about some girl caused a very serious affray between the town's-people and the gar- rison."5 The prisoner would confess to nothing, but swore pro- digiously at the tipsy young people who had disturbed him in the fulfilment of his duty. One of the Secretaries of the Finance repeated the whole verse to him. The soldiers standing about laughed aloud, but the ancient watchman swore, with tears in his eyes, that he had never thought of such a thing. While the examination was going on, and one of the Secretaries of the Finance Minister began to doubt whether the poor watchman was really in fault, an uproar was heard outside, and loud cries of "Watcrl, Watch!"   ^tfotntts of a jtin-I^ Btues     103 The guard rushed out, and in a few minutes the Field. Marshal entered the office, acompanied by the captain of the, guards on duty. "Have that scoundrel looked up tight," said the Marshal, pointing behind him-and two soldiers brought in a watchman, whom they held close prisoner, and whom they had disarmed of his staff and horn. "Are the watchmen all gone mad to-night?" exclaimed the chief of police. "I'll have the rascal punished for his infamous verses," said the Field-Marshal, angrily. "Your excellency," exclaimed the- trembling watch- man, " as true as I live, I never made a verse in my born days." "Silence, knave," roared the Marshal. "'ll have you hanged for them! And if you contradict me again, I'll cut you in two on the spot."  The police officer respectfully observed to the Field- Marshal that there must be some poetical epidemic among the watchmen, for three had been brought before him within the last quarter of an hour, accused of the same offence. , Gentlemen," said the Marshal to the officers who had accompanied him, " since the scoundrel refuses to confess, it will be necessary to take down from your remembrance, the words of his atrocious libel. Let them be written down while you recollect them. Come, who can say them? The officer of police wrote at the dictation of the gen- tlemen who remembered the whole verses between them:- On empty head a flaunting feather, A long queue tied with tape and leather; ; Padded breast and waist so little, Make the soldier to a tittle; By cards and dance, and dissipation, He's sure to win a Marshal's station.  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7943-00000052"/> 104        Gltima lton^ "Do you deny, you rascal," cried the Field-Marshal to the terrified watchman--" do you deny that you sang these infamous lines as I was coming out of my house?" ' They may sing it who like, it was not me," said the watchman. "Why did you run away, then, when you saw me?" "I did not run away." "What?" said the two officers who had accompanied the Marshal--" not run away? Were you not out of breath when at last we laid hold of you there by the market?" "Yes, but it was with fright at being so ferociously attacked/i  am trembling yet in every limb." "Lock the obstinate dog up till the morning," said the Marshal; " he will come to his senses by that time." With these words the wrathful dignitary went away. These incidents had set the whole police force of the city on the q/ui vive. In the next ten minutes two more watchmen were brought to the office on similar charges with the others. One was accused of singing a libel under the window of the- Minister of Foreign Affairs, in which it was insinuated that there were no affairs to which he was more foreign than those of his own department. The other-had sung some verses before the door of the Bishops Palace, informing him that the "lights of the church" were by no means deficient in tallow, but gave a great deal more smoke than illumination. The Prince, who had wrought the poor watchmen all this- woe, was always lucky enough to escape, and grew bolder and bolder with every new attempt. The afair was talked of everywhere. The Minister of Police, who was at cards with the King, was informed of the insurrection among the hitherto peaceful watchmen, and as a-proof of it, some of the verses were given to him in writing. The   ^bbontuti of?g6o- tgm's (bi 105 King laughed very heartily at the doggrel verse about the- miserable police who were always putting their noses into other people's family affairs, but could never smell anything amiss in their own, and were therefore lawful game, and ordered the next poetical watchman who should be taken to be brought before him. He broke up the card-table, for he saw that the Minister of Police had lost his good- humor. In the dancing-hall next to the card-room, Philip had looked at his watch, and discovered that the time of his appointment with Rose at St. Gregory's had nearly come. He was by no means sorry at the prospect of giving back his silk mantle and plumed bonnet to his substitute, for he began to find high life not quite to his taste. As he was' going to the door the Negro once more came up to him, and whispered, "Your Highness, Duke Herman is seeking for you everywhere." Philip shook his head impatiently and hurried out, followed by the Negro. When they got to the antechamber, the Negro cried out, "By Heaven, here comes the Duke!"-and slipped back into the hall. A tall black mask walked fiercely up to Philip, and said, "Stay a moment, sir,-I've a word or two to say to you -I've been seeking for you long." "Quick then," said Philip, "for I have no time to lose." "I would not waste a moment, sir-I have sought you long enough; you owe me satisfaction, you have injuredme infamously." "Not that I am aware of." "You -don't know me, perhaps," said the Duke, lifting up his mask-" now that you see me, your own conscience will save me any more words. I demand satisfaction. You and the cursed Salmoni have deceived me." "I know nothing about it," said Philip. 5*  &#xD;<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7943-00000053"/> 106    -fistmas ntoriea. "You got up that shameful scene in the cellar of the baker's daughter. It was at your instigation that Colonel Kalt made an assault upon me with a cudgel." "There's not a word of truth in what you say." "What?-you deny it? The Lady Blankenswerd, the Marshal's lady, was an eye-witness of it all, and she has told me every circumstance." "She has told your grace a fancy tale--I have had nothing to do with it-if you made an ass of yourself in a baker's cellar, that was your own fault." "I ask, once more, will you give me satisfaction? If not, I will expose you. Follow me instantly to the King. You shall either fight with me, or--go to his Majesty." Philip was non-plussed. "Your grace," he said, "I have no wish either to fight with you or to go to the King." This was indeed the truth, for he was afraid he should be obliged to unmask, and would be punished, of course, for the part he had played. He therefore tried to get off by every means, and watched the door -to seize a favorable moment for effecting his escape. The duke, on the other hand, observed the uneasiness of the Prince (as he thought him), and waxed more valorous every minute. At last he seized poor Philip by the arm, and was dragging him into the hall. "What do you want with me?" said Philip, sorely firightened, and shook off the Duke. "To the King. He shall hear how shamefully you insult a guest at his court." "Very good," replied Philip, who saw no hope of escape, except by continuing the character of the Prince. "Very good. Come, then, I am ready. By good luck I happen to have the agreement with me between you and the baker's daughter, in which you promise"-   -mitfturts of a gtIo-Iw's (be.  lo l Nonsense! stuff!" answered the Duke, that was only a piece of fun, which may be allowed surely with a baker's daughter. Show it if you like, I will explain all that." But it appeared that the Duke was not quite so sure of the explanation, for he no longer urged Philip to go before the King. He, however, insisted more earnestly than ever on getting into his carriage, and going that moment- Heaven knows where-to decide the matter with sword and pistol, an arrangement which did not suit our watchman at all. Philip pointed out the danger and consequences of such a proceeding, but the Duke overruled all objections. He had made every preparation, and when it was over he would leave the city that same night. "If you are not the greatest coward in Europe, you will follow me to the carriage-Prince!" "I--am--no--prince,"--at last stuttered Philip, now driven to extremities. "You are!-Everybody recognised you at the ball-I know you by your hat. You shan't escape me." Philip lifted up his mask, and showed the Duke his face. "Now, then, am I a prince?" Duke Herman, when he saw the countenance of a man he had never seen before, started back, and stood gazing as if he had been petrified. To have revealed his secrets to a perfect stranger! 'Twas horrible beyond conception!--But before he had recovered from his surprise, Philip had opened the door, and effected his escape. The moment he found himself at liberty, he took off his hat and feathers, and wrapping them in his silk mantle, rushed through the streets towards St. Gregory's, carrying them under his arm. There stood Rose already, in, a corner of the high church door, expecting his arrival.  &#xD;<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7943-00000054"/> 108        Ttma? itoe., "Ah Philip, dear Philip," she said, pressing his hand, "how happy you have made me! how lucky -we are! I was very uneasy to get away from my friend's house, and I have been waiting here this quarter of an hour, but never cared for the frost and snow-my happiness was so great: I am so glad you're come back." "And I too, dear Rose, thank God that I have'got back to you! May the eagles fly away with these trinkum-tran- kums of great people! But I'll tell you some other time of the scenes I've had. Tell me now, my darling, how you are, and whether you love me still!" "Ah! Philip, you've become a great man now, and it would be better to ask if you still care anything for me." '"Thunder! How came you to know so soon that I've been a great man?" "Why, you told me yourself. Ah! Philip, Philip, I only hope you won't be proud, now that you've grown so rich. I am but a poor girl, and not good enough for you now-and I have been thinking, Philip, if you forsake me, I would rather have had you continue a poor gardener. I should fret myself to death if you forsook me.' "What are you talking about, Rose? 'Tis true that for one half hour I have been a prince; 'twas but a joke, and I want no more of such jokes in my life. Now I am a watch. man again, and as poor as ever. To be sure I have five thou. sand dollars in my pocket, that I got from a Mameluke- that would make us rich, but unfortunately they don't belong to me!" "You're speaking nonsense, Philip," said Rose, giving him the purse of gold that the Prince had given her- "Here, take back your money, Itis too heavy for my bag." "What should I do with all this gold? Where did you get it, Rose?" "You won it in the lottery, Philip."   4bfntitm$ of a etu-gear' a,   109 "What! have I won? And they told me at the office my number was not yet out-I had hoped and wished that it might come to give us a setting up in the world-but gardener Redman said to me as I went a second time towards the office, ' Poor Philip-a blank'--Huzza! I have won! Now I will buy a large garden and marry you. How much is it?" "Are you crazy, Philip, or have you drunk too much? You must know better than I can tell you how much it is. I only looked at it quietly under the table at my friend's, and was frightened to see so many glittering coins, all of gold, Philip. Ah! then I thought, no wonder Philip was so impertinent-for, you know, you were very impertinent, Philip,-but I can't blame you for it. Oh, I could throw my own arms round your neck and cry for joy." "Rose, if you will do it I shall make no objections. But there's some misunderstanding here. Who was it that gave you this money, and told you it was my prize in the lottery? I have my ticket safe in my drawer at home, and nobody has asked me for it." "Ah! Philip, don't play your jokes on me! You your- self told me it half an hour ago, and gave me the purse with your own hand." "Rose-try to recollect yourself. This morning I saw you at mass, and we agreed to meet here to-night, but since that time I have not seen you for an instant.?' "No, except half an hour ago, when I saw you at Steii- man's door. But what is that bundle under your arm? Why are you without a--hat this cold night? Philip, Philip, be careful. All that gold may turn your brain.-You've been in some tavern, Philip, and have drunk more than you should. But tell me what is in the bundle? Why, here's a woman's silk gown.-Philip, Philip, where have you been?" "Certainly not with you half an hour ago; you want to  &#xD;<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC7943-00000055"/> "O . . . ltxmto mas itoxm^. play tricks on me, I fancy;-where have you got that money, I should like to know?" "Answer me first, Philip, where you got that woman's gown. Where- have you been, sir?" They were both impatient for explanations, both a little jealous-'and finally began to quarrel. But as this was a lovers' quarrel, it ended as, lovers' quarrels invariably do. When Rose took out her white pocket-handkerchief, put it to her beautiful eyes, and turned away her head as the sighs burst" forth from her breast, this sole argument proved instantly that she was in the right, and Philip decidedly in the wrong. He confessed he was to blame for everything, and told her that he had been at a masked ball, and that his bundle was not a silk gown, but a man's mantle and a hat and feathers. And now he had to undergo a rigid examination. Every maiden knows that a masked ball is a dangerous maze for unprotected hearts. It is like plunging into a whelming sea of dangers, and you will be drowned if you are not a good swimmer! Rose did not consider Philip the best swimmer in the world-it is difficult to say why. He denied having danced, but when she asked him he could not deny having talked with some feminine masks.  He related the whole story to her, yet would constantly add: "The ladies were of high rank, and they took me for another." Rose doubted him a little, but she suppressed her resentment until he said they took him for Prince Julian. Then she shook her little head, and still more when she heard that Prince Julian was transformed into a watchman while Philip was at the ball. But he smothered her doubts by saying that in- a few minutes the Prince would appear at St. Gregory's church and exchange his watchcoat for the mask. Rose, in return, related all her adventure; but when she came to the incident of the kiss--   Pbnterrtuw of a' ^ebo-rar' (sfe  1"O "Hold there!" cried Philip: "I didn't kiss you, nor, I am sure, did you kiss me in return." "I am sure 'twas intended for you, then," replied Rose, whilst her lover rubbed his hair down, for fear it should stand on end. "If 'twas not you," continued Rose anxiously, "I will believe all that you have been telling me." But as she went on in her story a light seemed to break in on her, and she exclaimed, "And after all, I do not believe it was Prince Julian in your coat!" Philip was certain it was, and cried: "The rascal! He stole my kisses--now I understand! That's the reason why he wanted to take my place and gave me his mask!"And now the stories he had heard at the masquerade came into Philip's head. He asked if anybody had called at her mother's to offer her money--if any gentleman was much about Milk street; if she saw any one watching her. at church; but to all his questions her answers were so satis- factory, that it was impossible to doubt of her total igno- rance of all the machinations of the rascally courtiers. He warned her against all the advances of philanthropical and compassionate princes, and Rose warned him- against the dangers of a masked ball and adventures with ladies of rank by which many young men have been made unhappy; and as everything was now forgiven, in consideration of the kiss not having been wilfully bestowed, he was on the point of claiming for himself the one of which he had been cheated, when his designs were interrupted by an unexpected inci- dent. A man out of breath with his rapid flight, rushed against them. By the greatcoat, staff, and horn, Philip recognised hit deputy. He, on the other hand, snatched at the silk cloak and hat. "Ah! sir," said Philip, " here are your things. I would not change places with you again in this world! I should be no gainer by the operation."  &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7943-00000056"/> "2        11xzftam ito]Xt$ "-Quick! quick!" cried the prince, and threw the watch- man's apparel on the snow and fastened on his mask, hat, and cloak. Philip returned to his old beaver and coat, and took up the lantern and staff. Rose had shrunk back into the door. "I promised thee a dole, comrade-but it's a positive fact-I have not got my purse." 1' I've got it here," said Philip, and held it out to him. "You gave it to my intended there; but please your High- ness, I must forbid all presents in that quarter." "4 Comrade, keep what you've got, and be off as quick as you can. You are not safe here.'" The Prince was flying off as he spoke, but Philip held him by the mantle. "One thing, my lord, we have to settle" "Run, watchman, I tell you. They're in search of you." ' I have nothing to run for. But yourpurse, here" "Keep it, I tell- you. Fly! if you can run." "And a billet of Marshal Blankenswerd's for five thou- sand dollars" "Ha! what the plague do you know about Marshal Blankenswerd?" "He said it was a gambling debt he owed you: He and his lady start to-night for their estates in Poland." "Are you mad? how do you know that? Who gave you the message for me?" "And, your Highness, the Minister of Finance will pay all your debts to Abraham Levi and others if you will use your influence with the king to keep him in office." "Watchman! you've been tampering with Old Nick." "But I rejected the offer." You rejected the offer of the Minister?" "Yes, your Highness. And, moreover, I have entirely   ghmtertmrr of a Ido-^ar' ba.   113 reconciled the -Baroness Bonau with the Chamberlain Pilzou." "Which of us two is a fool?" "Another thing, your highness-Signora Rollina is a bad woman. I have heard of some love affairs of hers. You are deceived-I therefore thought her not worthy of your attentions, and put off the meeting to-night at her house." "Signora Rollina! how did you come to hear of her?" "Anothei thing; Duke Herman is terribly enraged about that business in the cellar. He is going to complain of you to the King." "The Duke! who told you about that?" "Himself. You are not secure yet; but -I don't think he'll go to the-.ing, for I threatened him with his agree- ment with the baker's daughter. But he wants to fight you; be on your guard." "Once for all-do you know how the Duke was informed of all this?" , "Through the Marshal's wife. She told all, and con- fessed she had acted the witch in the ghost-raising." The Prince took Philip by the arm. "My good fel- low," he said, " you are no watchman." He-turned his face towards a lamp, and started when he saw the face of this strange man. "Are you possessed by Satan, or who are you?" said Julian, who had now become quite sober. "I am Philip Stark, the gardener, son of old Gottheb Stark, the watchman," said Philip, quietly. "Lay hold on him!  That's the man!" cried many voices, and- Philip, Rose, and Julian saw themselves suri- rounded by six'lusty servants of the police. Rose screamed, Philip took her hand, and told her not to be alarmed. The Prince clapped his hand on Philip's shoulder-  &#xD;<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC7943-00000057"/> "4 1tma          f "'Tis a stupid business," he, said, " and you should havE escaped when I told you. But don't be frightened, there shall no harm befall you." "That's to be seen," said one of the captors. "In the meantime he must come along with us.1" "Where to?" inquired Philip; "I am doing my duty. I am watchman of this beat." "' That's the reason we take you. Come." The Prince stepped forward. "Let the man go, good people," he said, and searched in all his pockets for his purse. As he found it nowhere, he was going to whisper to Philip to give it him, but the police tore them apart, and one of them shouted--' On! We can't stop to talk here." "The masked fellow must go with us, too, he is suspi- cious-looking." "Not so," exclaimed Philip, " you are in search of the watchman. Here I am, if you choose to answer for taking me from my duty. But let this gentleman go." "We don't want any lessons from you in our duty," replied the sergeant; " march all of them!-" "The damsel, too?" asked Philip, " you don't want her surely!" "No, she may go; but we must see her face, and take down her name and residence, it may be of use." "She is the daughter of widow Bittner," said Philip; and he was not a little enraged when the whole party took Rose to a lamp, and gazed on her tearful face. "Go home, Rose, and don't be alarmed on my account," said Philip, trying to comfort her, " my conscience is clear.7" But Rose sobbed so as to move even the policemen to pity her. - The Prince, availing himself of the opportunity, attempted to spring out of his captors' hands, but one of -the men was a better jumper than he, and put an obstacle in his way.   thenftare of -a itear-'s t f,   115 "Hallo!" cried the sergeant, "this fellow's conscience ... is not quite so clear-hold him firm-march,!" "Whither?" said the Prince. "Directly to the Minister of Police." "Listen," said the Prince, seriously but affably, for he did not like the turn affairs were taking, as he was anxious to keep his watchman frolic concealed. "I have nothing to do with this business. I belong to the court. If you ven- ture to force me to go with you, you will be sorry for it when you are feasting on bread and water to-morrow in prison." "For heaven's sake, let the gentleman go," cried Philip; "I give you my word he is a great lord, and will make you repent your conduct. He is" "Hush; be silent," interrupted Julian, " tell no human being who I am. Whatever happens, keep my name a secret. Do you hear! an entire secret from every one!" "We do our duty," said the sergeant, " and nobody can punish us for that; you may go to a prison yourself-- we have often had fellows speak as high, and threaten as fiercely-forward!" "Men! take advice, he is a distinguished man at court." "If it were a king himself he should go with us. , He is a suspicious character, and we must do our duty." While the contest about the Prince went on, a carriage with eight horses, and outriders bearing flambeaux, drove past the church., '"Stop!" said a voice from the carriage, as it was pass- ing the crowd of policemen, who had the Prince in custody. The carriage stopped. The door flew open, and a gen- tleman with a brilliant star on the breast of his surtout, leaped out. He pushed through the party, and examined the Prince from head to foot. "I thought," he said, "I knew the bird by his feathers.

"Answer me," roared Herman, in a voice of thunder. Julian shook his head and made signs to the Duke to desist, but he pressed the question home upon him, being determined to know who it was he had accosted at the masquerade. He asked the policemen-they stood with heads uncovered, and told him they had orders to bring the watchman instantly before the Minister of Police, for he had been singing wicked verses-they had heard some of them. That the mask had given himself out as some great lord of the court, but that they believed that to be a false pretence, and therefore considered it their duty to take him into custody. "The man is not of the court," answered the Duke, "take my word for that.- He insinuated himself clandes- tinely into the ball, and passed himself off for Prince Ju- lian. I forced him to unmask, and detected the impostor, but he escaped m6e. I have informed the Lord Chamber- lain-off with him to the palace! You have made a fine prize!" With these words the Duke strode back to his carriage, and once more urging them not to let the villains escape, gave orders to drive on. The Prince saw no- chance left. To reveal himself now would be to make his night's adventures the talk of the whole city. He thought it better to disclose his incognito to the Chamberlain or the Minister of Police. "Since it must be so, come on then," he said; and the party marched - forward, keeping a firm hand on the two prisoners. Philip was not sure whether he was bewitched, or whe- ther the whole business was not a dream, for it was a night such as he had never passed before in his life. He had nothing to 'blame himself for except that he had changed   btenilres of a IfPf-gat's (fre  117 clothes with the Prince, and then, whether he would or no, had been forced th support his character. He felt pretty safe, for it was the princely watchman who had been at fault, and he saw no occasion for his being committed. His heart beat, however, when they came to the palace. His coat, horn, and staff were taken from him. Julian spoke a few words to a young nobleman, and immediately the policemen were sent away: the Prince ascended the stairs, and Philip had to follow. "Fear nothing," said Julian, and left him. Philip was taken to a little anteroom, where he had to wait a good while. At last one of the royal grooms came to him, and said, "Come this way, the King will see you." Philip was distracted with fear. His knees shook so that he could hardly walk. He was led into a splendid chamber. The old King was sitting at a table, and laugh- ing long and loud; near him stood Prince Julian without a mask. Besides these there was nobody in the room. The King looked at Philip with a good-humored ex- pression. "Tell me all-without missing a syllable-that you have done to-night." Philip took courage from the condescension of the old King, and told the whole story from beginning to end. He had the good sense, however, to conceal all he had heard among the courtiers that could turn to the prejudice of the Prince. The King laughed again and again, and at last took two gold pieces from his pocket, and gave them to Philip: "Here, my son, take these, but say not a word of your night's adventures. Await your trial, no harm shall come of it to you. Now go, my friend, and remember what I have told you." Philip knelt down at the King's feet and kissed his hand, as he stammered some words of thanks. When he arose, and was leaving the room, Prince Julian said, "I-  &#xD;<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7943-00000059"/> "8        &amp;jriatmag tioriea beseech your Majesty to allow the young man to -wait a few minutes outside. I have some compensation to make to him for the inconvenience he has suffered." The King, smiling, nodded his assent, and Philip left the apartment. "Prince!" said the King, holding up his fore-finger in a threatening manner to his son, "'tis well for you that you told me nothing but the truth. For this time I must pardon your wild scrape, but if such a thing happens again you will offend me. There will be no excuse for you! I must take Duke Herman in hand myself. I shall not be sorry if we can get quit of him. As to the Ministers of Finance and Police, I must have further proofs of what you say. Go now, and give some present to the gardener." He has shown more discretion in your character than you have in his." The Prince took leave of the King, and having changed his dress in an anteroom, sent for Philip to go to his palace with him; there he made him go over-word for word- everything that had occurred. When Philip had finished his narrative, the Prince clapt him on the shoulder, and said, "Philip, listen! You're a sensible fellow. I can con- fide in you, and I am satisfied with you. What you have done in my name with the Chamberlain Pilzou, the Coun- tess Bonau, the Marshal and his wife, Colonel Kalt and the Minister of Finance-I will maintain-as if I had done it myself. But, on the other hand, you must take all the blame of my doings with the horn and staff. As a penalty for your verses, you shall lose your office of watchman. You shall be my head-gardener from this date; and have charge of my two gardens at Heirrleben and Quellenthal. The money I gave your bride she shall keep as her mar- riage-portion,-and I give you the order of Marshal Blan- kenswerd for five thousand dollars, as a mark of my regard. Go, now; be faithful and true!"   Ablzllnteg of i tFe-1t' Or.     119 Who could be happier than Philip! He almost flew to Rose's house. She had not yet gone to bed, but sat with her mother beside a table, and was weeping. He threw the purse on the table, and said, "Rose, there is thy dow- ry! and here are five thousand dollars, which are mine! As a watchman I have transgressed, and shall therefore lose my father's situation; but the day after to-morrow I shall go, as head gardener of Prince Julian, to Heimleben. And you, mother, and Rose, must go with me. My father and mother also. I can support you all. Huzza!-God send all good people such a happy New Year!" Mother Bittner hardly knew whether to believe Philip or not, notwithstanding she saw the gold. But when he told her how it had all happened-though with some reserva- tions-she wept with joy, embraced him, laid her daughter on his breast, and then danced about the room in a perfect ecstasy.  Do thy father and mother know this, Philip?" she said. And when he answered no, she cried: "Rose, kindle the fire, put over the water, and make some coffee for all of us." She then wrapped herself in her little woollen shawl and left the house. But Rose lay on Philip's breast, and forgot all about the wood and water. And there she yet lay when Mother Bittner returned with old Gottheb and Mother Katharine. They surrounded their children and blessed them. Mother Bittner saw, if she wanted coffee, she would be obliged to cook. it herself. Philip lost his situation as watchman. Rose became his wife in two weeks, their parents went with them to---but this does not belong to the adventures of a New Year's Eve, a night more ruinous to the Minister of Finance than any one else; neither have we heard of any-more pranks by the wild Prince Julian.  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7943-00000060"/> o    "o Oco    '.0     ..c t  00 . Christmas Changes. iE was a little old man, between sixty and seventy years of age, and over his thin hair he wore a black velvet skull-cap, and' a pair of blue goggles concealed his fast-dimming eyes. His sharply-hooked nose and thin compressed lips still bespoke, notwithstanding the general dulling of his senses, the keen, cool, calculating, worldly-wise, not to say, hard man. Sitting after dinner in his favorite easy-hair, beside his handsome dining-room table, with his modicum of French brandy in a tumbler before him, to, be filled up with three-fourths' hot water from the little china jug beside it, the little old man, such as we describe him, crossed one small leg over the other, and peered through his blue goggles at his pale wife, sitting opposite, for a reply to his last remark. She, her gentle eyes cast down, and an anxious pucker wrinkling her white forehead, appeared to wish to decline a reply; but at length, constrained there to by the piercing look from behind the blue goggles, ventured to say- It must be as you please, Mr. Curling; , but your own brother-you cannot allow it-people expect something."    (ttrismas 1;tmi. -     121 ce What is it to me what people expect?." replied the old man, in his harsh, grating voice. '"At the time of the late unfortunate occurrence, I said to him, 'Now, Thomas, I have once more freed you -from the consequences of your imprudence.

Delivering them to his master, he advanced towards his mistress;-am while Mr. Curling was deliberately cutting the paper round the seals, the domestic said, in a low voice, "' If you please, ma'am, Miss Curling wishes to speak to you immediately. She is in her own room."  Mrs. Curling rose, and as Joseph retired, his master inquired, suspiciously, "Hey! what's that?" "Only Charlotte, my dear, she wishes to speak to me." "Why send for you? Why cannot she come here?" "My dear, perhaps she is not well," said Mrs. Curling, gently. "Is there a letter for her?" "No," replied her husband, peering at the directions through his blue goggles. "I am surprised that there is not one by this mail from India," he continued. "I trust that the boy is not ill." "Ah! dear fellow," said Mrs. Curling, and the anxious pucker re-appeared on her forehead. Leaving the room, she ascended the stairs to the chamber of her daughter,  the only one of their children residing beneath the parental roof. It was a pleasant apartment, of considerable size, fur- 6  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7943-00000061"/> 122         tnatmas *tores. nished with every luxury, and gay with flowers and rare birds. Its occupant ran to meet her parent as she entered, and twined a pair of emaciated arms about her neck. "Mamma! dear mamma, such a letter from poor Annie. Oh! mamma, do you think he will relent! do you think he will forgive?" She was a poor dwarfed creature, this little Charlotte, and far from strong or well. A cruel accident in her baby- hood had warped her slender spine, leaving it but a weak and gnarled support for a fine and classical head, and a face lovely with the reflex of the meek, benevolent spirit within. This face, however, was now all woe-begone and tear-swol- len; and a fr-esh burst of tears added to its agonized expres- sion, as Charlotte hid her grief on the bosom of her affec- tionate mother. "Charlotte, my darling," said the habitually composed lady, suppressing two sympathetic drops that tried hard to fall from her white eyelids, and remained entangled in their jetty lashes--" my dearest child, recover yourself, and tell me what of our poor Annie." "Oh! mamma, mamma, such a letter, all about her hus- band leaving her, and  Oh! papa will say that he is always right about people. But he cannot allow her to starve, can he, mamma?" "I trust not, my love." Yet Mrs. Curling looked dubious. "Some men do not believe. But show me the letter".  Annie was not Mrs. Curling's ,own daughter; yet the gentle stepmother found it hard to maintain her composure, as she perused the blotted lines handed to her by Charlotte:- "My darling Charlotte,-My own loving little sister, yoUr poor Annie is so wretched, so very wretched! What shall I do? He is gone-gone for ever! still loved, though   trxfitmwfi .a/Btangt a   123 latterly so cruel, and I have not a penny in the house. But I don't think much of that.

The whole world is full of gloom. Do you think my father would let me come? Plead for me; ask dear mamma to do her best. I will be quiet and submissive, and please him in everything; only he must not be too severe on poor Edward;^ I could not bear that. My poor husband, he suffered so, and men cannot endure like women, and I daresay he thought I should be no worse off without him. I scarcely know what I write; but dear, dearest Charlotte, let me have a few lines soon, to say what is to be done.          ANNE." Mrs. Curling remained awhile in deep thought, then saying, "I will go and see what can be done with your father, Charlotte," she gave her one kiss, and left the room.   : Meanwhile the little old man below sat in angry cogita- tion over one of the letters he had received. Poor Annie's request came at an unfortunate moment. "Well, what now?" he testily inquired, as his wife re-entered the room; " what nonsense is in the wind now? Do not let it be anything to vex me, Mrs. Curling; I have quite enough here to do that, ma'am." And, quite trans- ported out of his usual manner, Mr. Curling tossed the offending letter across the table to his wife. It was from a tenant of one of Mr. Curling's small houses in Denton street, whose rent was over due; and  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7943-00000062"/> 124        (g ptmm litorxe. who, knowing from report the chaiacter of his landlord, wrote to beseech his forbearance for a few weeks. The poor man candidly explained his position; told Mr. Curling how his wife lay-dying of a fever, that had likewise stricken down two of his children, and how he himself had been cheated by a plausible friend. Mrs. Curling read the letter and returned it, saying timidly, "You will give him time, Mr. Curling!" "Time r yes, to take himself off, and his sick family, to the hospital before the sale commences. Do you suppose I do not see through this humbug? I shall certainly send a man in to'take possession to-morrow, Mrs. Curling, what- ever you may think of me," added the little man, observing that his wife looked pained. "I have had enough of arrears of rent." Poor Mrs. Curling! it was not a very good opportunity for disclosing her errand. But there must be no delay, -Annie might be starving! So she steadied her voice, which was sadly wavering and trembling, like her whole frame, and acquainted Mr. Curling that when he was at liberty to attend to her, she had a letter to read to him. He re-seated himself, for, in his heat about the insolent tenant, he had been walking hurriedly to and fro, and, fixing his blue gog- gles full on' his wife's countenance, awaited her next words in severe silence. Softening down what she knew her husband would regard as exaggeration amounting to untruthfulness, she began :- "My dearest Charlotte  " But of course we are not going to inflict the whole letter upon our readers over again.

Five minutes elapsed, and Mr. Curling had uttered no word; only, he crossed one leg peevishy over the other, and, giving a jerking turn in his chair, conveyed the blue goggles so far away, that his wife could only see the extreme outward rim of the one that concealed his left eye. Another five minutes passed in the same suspense, deter- mined Mrs. Curling upon speaking. But just as the words hovered upon her subdued lips, she was prevented. Her husband had jerked himself round again, and was taking his purse-an old-fashioned leather one, with a steel clasp-out of his pocket. He opened it and his mouth simultaneously. "There," he said, depositing a bank-note on the table before Mrs. Curling, but slowly and with a peculiar mani- pulation, as if it stuck to his fingers-and bank-notes do stick to the fingers of men like Mr. Curling-" there, send that to the disobedient ingrate, and tell her she must do as better women have done, go out into the world and work for her living, thanking God that she is rid of a villain. No more," he continued, stopping Mrs. Curling as she was about to speak, perhaps to plead with him; "no more. Write exactly as I tell you." His wife left the room, and hastened to her daughter, who was anxiously awaiting the result of the confference. Mingling their regrets together, the two women comforted each other, and then wrote to poor Annie, though not exactly in the terms commanded by Mr. Curling. The bank-note was one for five pounds. *   8   8   8    8      + - It is the day after that on which our tale opens. In a small, confined bedroom, on the first floor of a tall, narrow house, in an unwholesome street about three miles distant from Mr. Curling's fine suburban residence, a woman lies  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7943-00000063"/> 12 6             M' Oxsmas i}ome. struggling with the scant breath of life that yet lingers in her attenuated frame. Her mother-in-law bends over her in tears, and prays that the agony may pass away, and that the Saviour in whom she has trusted may receive her to Himself. While thus praying, a man, elderly, thin, and with a look of intense distress upon his haggard counte- nance, enters the apartment, and beckons to his mother, who goes behind the curtain of the bed to speak to him. "Is the doctor come?" .she inquires. "I thought I -heard his voice." "No," replies the man, in a hollow whisper. "It is- it is-the bailiffs. I could not keep them out; they came upon me unawares." "And Elizabeth lying there! The Lord forgive him; he is a cruel man; and after your letter, too! Well, thank God, she is nearly out of his reach." "You don't mean, mother-not so soon!" "James, my poor son, you must part with Elizabeth to- day. She is drawing away fast. Thank God! her poor soul knows where to lean for support. Weep not for her, my son, it is we who are to be pitied. She is going where the tears are wiped from every eye." "I wish we were going with her, mother. The world is gloomy enough,- and what will it be without her?" "James, submit your will to His. You have great cause for thankfulness, my poor son; Mary and Jemmy are so much better. The /doctor said last night, that he did not doubt but they would be about in a few days." "Aye, with nourishing food; and how are we to get it? But it is sinful to despair; God will provide for that. Yet, oh! mother, my Elizabeth! my dear, dear wife!' It seemed as if the stifled cry of love's agony reached the dull ear of the dying woman. There was a slight stir in the bed, and James's mother hastened to her post.   Eil a         beth'tmas yswtrngesid   127 Elizabeth's eyes were wide open, and, as her husband like- wise drew near, they fell upon him, and a faint, sweet smile passed over her countenance. He knelt beside her, and took her wan hand in his. "James," she whispered, so low that he had to place his ear close to her lips to catch the words; " my children -bring them-I am going-Jesus-Saviour." The fluttering whisper ceased, and the soul was with its God. The mother and her son knelt in prayer, for the bereaved husband was too much awestricken even to weep. Meanwhile, the rich landlord's bailiffs kept their grim watch below. The scene changes. A woman is sitting all alone in a gloomy parlor, where no sound is heard, save the buzzing of a solitary fly that has survived the autumnal frosts, and the tinkle of the dying embers of a very poor, little fire. She shivers, for it is a bitter cold day, and the room is cold, and her own heart is cold, and she feels as if nothing would ever warm it again. Yes, one thing might, perhaps, and that is denied her. "Cruel father! he could send me that paltry bank-note, and tell .me to go out and battle with the world, when I would far rather lay me down and die. Oh! if I could but spend one whek, only one week, with my dear mother and sister, I think it would strengthen me to do his bidding. Oh, my home! my home!" Poor Annie! poor deserted one! She was still young, and might have been pretty, but ithat her cheek was so sallow, and her eye so dull and dim, and her hair so neglected. Not in picturesque dishevelment, but, all mat- ted and forlorn, it lay in ragged -masses upon cheek and neck;. and the shabby, faded shawl, and the thin, elevated shoulders and crouching form, as she gathered herself  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC7943-00000064"/> 128         mritmaw Sorms,. together to. keep out the cold, contributed to the general ungracefulness of her appearance. Talk as the poets will of beauty in distress, we are not lovable when soul and condition are alike wretched, save to those who love us very truly. But what mattered it to the deserted wife? The eye that she alone sought to please, cruel and cold as it had often been when rendered desperate by circumstances, flashing and furious when maddened by strong drink, had vanished from her presence for ever. It even bestowed its fitful and undesirable love upon another-bult Annie knew not that. Happy for her-if the word happy may be even com- paratively applied in such a position-for a last drop in the cup of her bitterness might have turned her poor racked brain, and sent the disobedient daughter unprepared to her last account. Oh! Almighty Father, may she yet atone, if not by her weary punishment, yet by acts of duty rendered where they have long been due! But her father's hard heart, that must be vanquished, to afford her the opportunity. Alas! how the influences of the spirit of mercy are needed in this earth of ours! Yet it is fitting, and a part of the wise designs of the Creator, that the sinning should like- wise be the suffering, even in this world. Again we shift our scene. This time we convey our reader to a neighboring town, and beg him to observe, in a neat room behind a small linendraper's shop, the shutters of which last are closed, a husband and wife, who sit opposite each other in mournful silence. At length the husband speaks. "One poor two hundred pounds would have got me out of my present difficulties, and preserved my credit until I could reduce the business, or commence another and a   e on            ri tmre s hetngj w      129 safer one. And he refuses! he who has thousands lying at his banker's! Why, my failure itself is entirely his fault." C I have heard you say so before, my love," remarked the wife. "I know, and can bear testimony, at any rate, that it is no want of industry on your part, or of economy on mine, that has caused you to come to a stand-still. But explain to me exactly how it is your brother's fault, as you say. I believe he set you up with the kindest intentions." "So he did, Emily; at least we will give him credit for assisting me for my own sake, and not merely because I belonged tothe family. But this is how it is. A kindness half done had frequently better be left undone. When Ralph saddled me with this concern, he gave me no capital to carry it on with, though he well knew I had little or nothing left of my own. Without capital, how was I to buy in the stock-in-trade? When customers inquired for this thing or the other, it was frequently wanting. Of course they soon got tired, and went where they were sure of procuring what they wanted." ' And that, Thomas, you consider the sole cause of your failure?" "Of course, Emily. The shop is in an excellent situa- tion; the business was an old-established one. I spared no effort to keep it together, and with a thousand, or even five hundred pounds, to turn over in the course of lthe year, I know I could have made it more than answer i" "Well," said his wife, " there -is nothing for it but submission. When do the creditors meet?" "Mamma! mamma! are we not to go to school any more?" interrupted a rosy little boy and girl, bursting breathlessly in. "Aunt Mary says so." "It is to}o true, my dears," replied their fond mother, gazing sorrowfully upon them. "Why do you say, ' too true,' mamma, and with that 6*  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7943-00000065"/> -130        jnstmo SitofQ. mournful voice, too?" inquired the little Emily. "We are glad, are we not, Ralph??' "Oh, yes, yes! A answered the little boy, dancing about the room for joy.          i ("My darlings, come hither," said their mother, and her grave tone this time made some impression upon them. "I mhust make you understand how it is that you are not to go to school any longer, and then you will not be so very glad." So they came about her chair, and she lifted little Ralph on to her knee, and making Emily sit at her feet, she told them how their father had become very poor; and that, carefully as they had lived, they were now obliged to be much more careful. "Then, will my father keep a shop?" asked Emily, who had always been very proud of the decked-out win- dows, and thought a shopkeeper rather a grand personage. "No, my love, we are going to remove from this house and shop. We shall live in a very tiny house; ,and your father will go as an assistant into another man's shop." "Oh, dear, dear," said Emily, '"I am very sorry." "But I am glad," persisted little Ralph, " because I shall have no more nasty lessons to learn." "Do not flatter yourself, Ralph," replied his mother; "you will still have lessons to learn, The only difference will be, that you will say them to me, instead of to Miss Woods."  The children retired into a corner, and talked over this wonderful news in low voices, while their mother prepared tea; for she had already dismissed the little maid-6o-all- work who had been wont to share her labors. Then, when all was ready, the family assembled quietly round the table. Theschildren ate with their usual appetite, and a mirthful word or laugh would break out occasionally, notwithstand- ; LI IYMM rYIW*L vu VVWNLVIIINILJ) LIVU rlVIII)UCUIIA-   pit;Wi0 }angt$r.     131 ing the shade of gloom which the manner of their parents threw upon them. Mrs. Curling poured out a cup of tea for her husband, which he drank almost unconsciously, but tasted no food. She herself took nothing. As the evening advanced, joy-bells filled the frozen at. mosphere with music, and people hurried to and fro, mak. ing their purchases; but the bankrupt's shop remained dart and joyless, and in the neat parlor behind, the parents; their little ones soundly asleep in their beds above, sat to- gether over the waning fire, and imagined all manner of dismal objects in its red recesses. Yet it was a night on which the general world is glad-it was Christmas-Eve! Yes, it was Christmas-Eve, and on such an occasion there was wont to be, yeat after year, a well spread dinner table at Ralph Curling's, graced by the presence of one- or two friends, whose worldly wisdom and dry humor rendered them especially acceptable to its master. But where were they to-night? and where were pale Mrs. Curling and kind little Charlotte? and, above all, where was the littlecold man with the velvet skull-cap and the blue goggles, who had, for some thirty years back, never been missing from hiE easy-chair in the dining-room at this hour? Where was he? In his own chamber, stretched almost senseless on his luxurious bed, his gentle wife weeping bitterly beside him; and servants came and went softly; and the doctor was summoned, lest the attack should prove one of apo- plexy or paralysis; and all was confusion and dismay in that comfortable suburban mansion.' As for poor little Charlotte, she too lay prostrate on her bed in her own apartment, for her weakly frame could ill sustain the shock that had overtaken the family. And the cause of all this? Have the rich man's pos- sessions melted away from his tight grasp, leaving him in a  &#xD;<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7943-00000066"/> 132        tomnit atsta far worse position than those on whom his stern missives and unrelenting dealings have fallen this day like a blight? Is he -become a beggared bankrupt in his frail old age, after some twenty or thirty years' enjoyment of hard-earned luxury? Alas! no. A mere worldly trial, the loss of a little of the shining dust which plays so conspicuous a part in the drama of life, might Ihave rendered the man frantic, despairing, mad; but would never have prostrated him in the speechless agony that now froze his blood. In this world-hardened and generally unsympathizing heart, there yet existed an unsuspected corner, where lingered the sole remaining tenderness of the -man's nature; and this secret tenderness it was which had now, by the all-wise dispen- sations of Providence, been converted into a fountain of anguish. Let us, however, no longer deal in parables, but carry our reader back with us to the luncheon hour at- Mr. Cur- ling's, on this same Christmas-Eve. The slight meal was spread in the dining-room, and Mr. Curling sat in his usual easy-chair, the blue goggles more lively than usual, and the whole man pleasanter, and less critical. The truth was, he was pleased with himself. He had succeeded in overcom- ing certain half-perceptible and wholly-amazing twinges of heart or conscience, relative to his daughter Annie; which he called weaknesses, but- which others might have considered gleams of a better nature, or a very allowable remnant of paternal affection for the erring one. How- ever that might be, Ralph had got rid of the suspicious emotions in a manner peculiar to himself, and was rejoicing in his renewed liberty (of mind; so that he even deigned to be facetious, in a stiff, dry sort of way, with little Char. lotte, sitting near her,mother at the opposite side of the table. The fire blazed cheerfully; Mrs. Curlings pet ca- nary twittered in his gilded cage in the large bay-window,   and peered through the plate-glass window-panes at two c three sooty suburban sparrows, that hopped hither an thither on the half-melted snow of the lawn outside, leaw ing the prints of their tiny claws on its surface. Said canar to himself, as many of our convicted felons might say t the honest working man, 1"I am better off than you, thoug I am in prison, and you are fiee ;" and forthwith he nibble, his rape-seed, and sipped his fiesh water from the crysts bottle, with increased gusto, and carolled a sudden snatc] of shrill song. But Mr. Curling could not suffer this i his dignified presence, and he signified as much to his wife who rose to throw her pocket-handkerchief over the cage thus silencing the noisy songster. As she did this, sh( caught sight of the postman coming in at the gate. Oh! penny-postman, liveried servant of that might3 abstraction, Her Majesty's mail, how often, when in greal suspense waiting for an important letter, have we in oul youthful fantasies wished you endued with bells, that we might at least know when you were in our neighborhood! And were it likewise well, O postman! if you carried that matter-of-fact, commonplace visage of yours, according to a prescient instinct that we suspect you to possess as to the contents of that fateful budget in your hand, that one might form a cursory guess whether it contain news that will please or freeze us, set us dancing with pleasure, or drive us frantic with woe or disappointment? O post- man! such a sympathetic countenance would sometimes be a kindly warning, preventing the flood of joy or misery from too sudden and overwhelming an invasion of our frail human faculties. Mrs. Curling remained standing at the window for some moments, perhaps thinking somewhat in the above strain. At any rate she had fallen into a short but deep reverie; hearing, as in a dream, the postman's ring, and the entrance  &#xD;<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7943-00000067"/> t134          nmas itories of the servant with letters. She was aroused by a terrified exclamation from Charlotte, and turned just in time to see her husband falling from his chair, while an open letter, with an inclosure, lay on the table before him. So much she un- consciously noted as she sprang towards him, hurriedly desiring Cqarlotte, who sat as if petrified, to ring the bell for assistance. When the stricken man had been carried to his bed, and everything done for him that duty and affection could sug- gest, Mrs. Curling remembered the letter, and sought in it the cause of this mysterious attack. Alas! it was quickly evident. The wafer (for it was an Indian letter) was black; the handwriting that of a stranger. Mr. Curling's only son had perished, not on the glorious battle-field, but in his bed, of a fever caught while attending a fellow-officer; who, in his turn, nursed the generous youth who had sacrificed his life for him, and now broke, as gently as might be, the shock to his mourning family. But, kindly as this was done, it was too much for the father, who had bestowed the whole strength of his affection upon one cherished idol. The Great Father, with a kindly purpose, smites us in our idols; there is no use in disguising the fact. How otherwise could the hard, cold natures of men like this Ralph Curling, be broken up sufficiently to receive the dews from Heaven, and the seed of the Word, that so they may, even at the eleventh hour, bring forth fruits meet for repent- ance? The evening came; the half-melted snow crisped as the night set in, intensely brilliant with a frosty starlight, and a broad full moon, that hung forth in bold relief like a golden lamp in the indigo sky. The devout of various sects hurried to church or chapel; the thoughtless and the poor made their late marketings for the,morrow's feasting. The joy- bells rang out in this town also, and the deserted Annie   PridMmT  cW3tr      135 heard them in her far quarter of the city, and the widower in Denton street heard them, as he sat desolate-hearted beside his convalescent children. Ralph Curling also heard them from the little church in his neighborhood, for sense and memory had returned, with twilight, though his left side was partially paralysed. But to him they sounded like a funeral peal. "Sarah," he said to his wife, in imperfect accents-he had scarcely ever called her by her Christian name-"Sarah, that letter inclosed in the other, read it now.'" Mrs. Curling took it from her pocket; the seal was yet unbroken, and the superscription, "For my dear father, with speed," was in his handwriting who- should never more take pen in hand. It was like a missive from the grave. Are you sure you can bear 'it, my dear?" she said gently, bending over her husband's pillow. He turned his face away, and covered his eyes with his bony hand. Read-read," he repeated, with a husky voice. She obeyed. The letter was short, and written with a faltering pen, and here and there was an almost illegible line, as if the writer's scanty remnant of strength had failed him. Meanwhile, the chime of the bells mingled with her voice, and filled up the pauses. ;' My Beloved Father,-From my bed of death I write this, at intervals as I have strength, and Grey will see that it is sent to you. I am going fast, but I thank God that he has restored my reason to pen my last farewell to you. My dear father, I have not been all that I ought to have been, but my heavenly Parent has forgiven my sins, for my Saviour's sake, and is now my guide and support in this awful hour. Oh! father, make him yours. Not all the  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7943-00000068"/> 136 ,       ittmas  toirso gold that you have heaped will give you one moment pleasure, in such an hour as this. My father, kind and it dulgent as you have ever been to me, I have noticed tha you are hard to other people. Permit me, now standing i the light of eternity, with the portals of the other worl already opening to receive me, to remind you that charit, is above all things, that ' Love is the fulfilling of the law Oh! my father, my beloved father, be merciful, be pitiful and entreat that the Holy Spirit may enlighten your soul that you may discern the things that belong to your eterna peace. Praying that the grace of the Saviour may, res upon you, with kindest love to my good, unknown mother and my dear little sister Charlotte, your ever affectionate though dying son, SC CHARLES CURLUG. "P S.--Annie, father, poor disobedient Annie, I fear she will be in trouble. Forgive her, father, as you hope to be forgiven. It is my last request." Mrs. Curling's gentle face was almost drowned in tears as she concluded. Her husband made no other comment than a deep groan, that seemed wrung as it were from the anguish of his spirit. For a while he lay quite still; -then, ex- tending his hand and muttering, "Give me the letter," he placed it beneath his pillow; and again turning his face towards the wall, remained motionless for many hours. These death-bed warnings, perhaps, rarely work any permanent good. In some instances, however, they are blessed, and reach their mark in the heart's core, dividing asunder the mass of old sins like a two-edged sword, stir- ring them up to be repented of, and causing a vital change in the whole life thereafter. Such was the case with Ralph Curling. The gentle, respectful hints and admonitions of the loved and lost, tempered as they were with the utmost   (rdIismaa dteltes a                 - -13  filial affection, rankled in the old manll's spirit like barbec , arrows, and worked silently there during several days of sickness and anguish. Meanwhile the sale in Denton street had been postponed, for want of further instructions. Annie still shut herself up with her grief, subsisting on her father' churlishy-bestowed bounty; which, indeed, was scarcely yet diminished, for the sick at heart have little care for needful food. In the neighboring townj Thomas Curling and his patient wife were much in the same position as when we saw them last, the 'time for the meeting of the creditors being yet undecided; while little Emily and Ralph, notwithstanding their parents' sadness, revelled in their unwonted liberty.  So the days elapsed; and now it was the morning of New Year's Eve. Mr. Curling had passed a calm night, sleeping soundly at intervals. His wife was surprised when she came to his bedside after breakfast, to mark the vivacity of his eye, the revivification of the whole man, scarcely compatible with the fact of his recent seizure. She almost suspected some access of fever. Yet his skin was cool, though his pulses bounded like those of youth. "Sarah," he said, as she stood looking wonderingly upon him, " are you at liberty to help me to dress?    I must get up.". "My love," she replied, uneasily, for this request alarmed her, " you know the doctor said that perhaps it would be another week before you would be able to-rise with safety. You ought not to think of it, indeed." ".Sarah, do not attempt to prevent me.   I have work to do, I have business to see after, that requires my person- al attention,' added Mr. Curling, decidedly. Seeing that his wife still hesitated, "If you will not assist me to dress, I shall be compelled to ring for Joseph to do so." "No, no, I would rather attend to you myself," replied  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7943-00000069"/> 138            :9r0i1nu 0isteo* Mrs. Cairling, perceiving that the sick man would not be deterred: from his rash design, as she considered it. She accordingly helped him to array himself, and having brought him warm water to bathe his face and hands, placed him comfortably in his easy-chair by the fire. The Venetian window-blind was partially raised, and the wintry sunshine filled the roomn with a subdued hazy lustre. The 'small birds twittered their remembrance of the last spring-tide, or their hope for that which was hidden in the comingI months. Conspicuous among them was a robin, who, perched on a branch of the leafless pear-tree beneath the window, carolled a lively ditty, telling of crumbs and cheerfulness; and everything testified that this was one of those sweet winter days with which we are sometimes fa- vored, and which unite the mildness of early spring with the pensiveness of the fading autumn. Mr. Curling sat by the crackling fire for some time in silence, then turned to his wife, who was quietly working at a small table near him. ',It is a beautiful day, Sarah, is it not? almost like April?"  "Yes, my dear," she replied, without looking up from her work. "Have you my glasses there?" She handed them to him. He had already put on his velvet cap, and looked much like his former self, save that there was a slight alteration of countenance, but so general and undefinable, that you would have been puzzled to say in what the change consisted. "' I cannot quite manage these glasses with this awkward hand. Thank you, my dear, that will do. And- now, Sarah," he continued, "I am about to make what you will consider a most extraordinary request. You must lie so good as to ring the bell, and give orders for the carriage to be brought round."   mfiatm l,sttg.       139 "Not to take you out, my dear, dear husband!" ex- claimed Mrs. Curling, surprised out of her ordinary timidity of language, and looking really distressed. "Indeed, you n are too imprudent." Mr. Curling took her hand, a thing he had never done since the days of their reserved courtship. "Sarah," he said, in a gentle tone-so gentle that she looked in his face to see if it were really he-"I am not mad, as you may suspect. But- for this poor helpless hand and arm, and some remaining weakness, I am not even ill. But I have commands to execute that I dare not disobey; and you know," he added, after a slight pause, as of partial embarrassment, "we must work while it is called to. day. Cease to oppose me, therefore, and do as I have said." His wife had intelligence enough to perceive that some wonderful change had passed over the once hard, keen old man. A prophetic gleam even of his intention shone through her woman's perception, and she hastened to obey his be- hests. The carriage was brought round, and into it he got, warmly clothed in a greatcoat and sundry furs and wrap- pers. Mrs. Curling followed, having, at his particular re- quest, attired herself to accompany him. "My dear," he said, "desire Joseph to drive to Denton street." *    e    He   *    * a  An hour afterwards, the poor tenant in Denton street was sitting by himself in his little parlor, with his face buried in his hands, and crying like a child. He was still in this position when his mother returned from her small weekly marketing.            - "What is the matter, James?" she asked, despond- ingly, as she seated herself wearily on the old sofa near him. "' What fresh trouble has befallen us now? Where are the  &#xD;<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7943-00000070"/> "O       ;$risntmas ifrit. . children?" she continued, her mind recurring to them as the possible cause of grief. ' They are in the kitchen," replied her son, lifting up his head, and exhibiting a countenance that completely puz- zled his mother., She could almost have fancied that his   emotion had nothing so very painful in it after all, but that she believed joy to be an unlikely guest to cross their threshold. "No fresh trouble, mother," he replied to her puzzled look. "I will tell you all as soon as I can. Mary and Jemmy, though, could explain it better and quicker, so please go and ask them, for I declare it has made a com- plete baby of me." "I will call them here," said his mother; " we can't talk before that surly man. I wish all was over, James, and we were removed, if only to get rid of him sitting there." "Mother, he is, there no longer."           ? "My son, what do you mean?'"  "I mean what I say, mother; he is there no longer. Look at this!" And with a kind of solemn joy, the poor man took a paper from a blank envelope that lay before him on the table, and placed it in his mother's hands. It was a cheque for a hundred pounds. "But-but--" stammered the old woman, gazing help- lessly upon it, "I don't understand. 'Ralph Curling!' -  I that is your hard landlord, James."  "Hard no longer, mother, but the kindest, the best  friend; though, to be sure, his manner is a little stiff." X There was no need- to call the children. Their father, now that he was fairly launched into his subject, dpscribed  the events of the last hour with a certain sort of eloquence,  inspired by intense feeling. How he had been startled and l somewhat alarmed by the stopping of a handsome carriage at his humble door; how Mr. Curling himself had stepped "   -  ar Catmsts ter gtf    141 out of it and entered the house, accompanied by a pretty but pale and timid-looking lady, whom he intrqruced as his wife. How, with a far kinder manner than his tenant had supposed could ever belong to him, the gentleman had made minute inquiries into the poor man's circumstances, and finding his statement corroborated by the artless re- plies of the children, and that his poverty was no fault of his, but to be attributed to a series of circumstances over which he had no control, had not only dismissed the bailiff, and agreed to forgive him his arrears of rent until better times, but had even offered to lend him a hundred pounds, at four per cent. interest, to enable him to open a small shop as a fancy stationer. "I told him, mother, that I had been brought up to the business and was sure I could make it answer, so we arranged that I should immediately take that small shop at the corner of Cross street. And you and Mary, mother, shall knit some of those gimcrack things in Berlin wool, and put them in the windows. We will be sure to make it out, somehow-won't we, mother?, "Thank the Lord, my son, for all his mercies," ejacu- lated the pious old woman.  "He has seen your upright intentions, and though he has tried you sorely, it was but to make your reward the greater. If our poor Elizabeth could but have lived to behold this day!' "Ah! mother--? *     *     e    * +   g An hour later still, and Annie was sitting in her mean room, but not now alone. Kind little Charlotte wasj re  with her, seated close by her side; her transparent chees wet with tears,:through which a smile was struggling, and her fond arms wound round her sorrowful, but no longer des- pairing sister. For Charlotte had been sent thither as the bearer of a note, full of affection and kindness, though couch-  &#xD;<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC7943-00000071"/> "2        jnstmam 4SXtot&amp;0 ed somewhat in the' dry style that was a second nature with Mr. Cut g, and not easily to be altered by any change of feelii So all was harmony now, and Annie was to pack up her poor apparel and go with Charlotte in the carriage which was to be sent to them, to spend the New Year's Eve, and many more thereafter, in the sheltered re- treat of her old home. No longer sallow, dishevelled, almost ugly Annie. A tinge of color beautifies- her oval cheek; her brown hair has been gathered up and smoothed by the dexterous hand of her young sister; her dark eyes brighten and soften be- neath the influence of kindness. Oh! who would not be kind? Ye who are severe in judgment, intent on rectifying the errors of your weaker brethren and sisters, by what you consider a just reprehen- sion of their sins, permit the due influence of those twin angels of God, Love and Pity, in your indurated bosoms, and you will be astonished to find what a paradise will spring up there-a paradise from whose shining gates shall flow out upon all the world, harmonizing and cheering rays of mercy and forgiveness. So Annie gathered up her scanty remnant of clothing, and her few little relics of early wedding-days, before the illusion of the courtship and honeymoon had been proved over and over again to be a bad delusive cheat. Then she stepped into the next street, laden with the remainder of her provisions, and gave them to a poor hard-working wi- dow woman, for a New Year's feast :for her seven hungry children. And so, extinguishing the tiny fire, closing the shdfers, and drawing down the blinds, the sisters went out andllocked the door, feeling as if a woe had been left behind, and locked into the dark and solitary house.

How many wishes, and anticipation's, and fears, and, above all, resolu- tions, that tesselated pavement of the abyss, have their origin with the birth-day of each new year! "We shall do better this year, please God, than we did the last. This year will, I hope, see my family all settled and doing for themselves. It is likely to be a bad year for the poor, God help them! With this new year I begin a new life, according to my solemn resolutions; the Lord enable me to keep them!"Such are the thoughts of hearts that shall be cold ere its close, or shall live to see their hopes, fears, anticipations, resolutions, frustrated or made void by the force of circumstances. But let us cease to deal with generalities, and take a peep at Ralph Curling's comfortable dining-room, at the usual hour for our visit thereto. Mr. Curling himself is there, seated in his easy-chair; for, though compelled to retire to bed after his benevolent exer- tions of yesterday, he rallied in time to join the company after dinner, on this New Year's Day. He is in deep mourn- ing of course, as are all the rest, and wears his invariable blue goggles and velvet skull-cap. But there is no peering of hard suspicious eyes beneath the glasses, or hasty ques- tioning about the merest trifle, or peevish tossing to and fro on his chair, as if the cushions were bestudded with thorns plucked from Mammon's uneasy crown. Instead, is visible a melancholy calm of demeanor, for the old man's thoughts are ever near his son's grave in the far tropical country; and an occasional ray of benevolence, as the softened eyes rest on one or another of the suffering ones with whom his awakened conscience has made its own peace.

Annie occupies her stepmother's old place, and Charlotte clings closely to her, admiring how changed she is from the Annie she found her only yesterday. - Thomas Curling, his wife, and their two children--the latter full of awe at the grandeur, as they think it, of everything in their rich uncle's house-fill up the remainder of the seats at the table.                  * Necessarily there was nothing of a gay tone in this family reunion, taking place as it did in a house of mourn- ing. But hope, and forgiveness, and mutual good-will were there; the brothers did justice to each other's better qualities; and Arnnie felt in her penitent soul, for the first time, how gravely she had sinned in slighting the paternal blessing upon her youthful choice. "It was my conduct, doubtless," she thought, and a tear stole down her cheek, which Charlotte, in her loving scrutiny remarking, placed to the account of the absent traitor--" it was my conduct that rendered my father's character harder than it otherwise would have been. I was his eldest, his pride, and he expected that I should have lbeen his joy. My disobedience and poor Edward's folly soured his temper, and rendered him suspicious of every one about him." Perhaps Annie was right. It is certain that her stolen marriage had been a great blow to her father; and when men of a certain rigidity of mind are disappointed in their expectations of one human being to whom they have implicitly trusted, they frequently end by thinking unchari- tably of all.

"'Masters taking a strange turn, remarked Joseph. ed when him and Missus went in the carriage yesterday, but I didn't think of him treating them quite as if they was his equals.), "Ah! , said the cook, "it's ever since the news of young master's death.

'       '       ' "Well, I,'m glad,", said the housemaid, who had been some years in the family.  "But for young master's death -and he's gone to heaven, if ever young gentleman did- perhaps Miss Annie, as I always calls her, married though she be, would not this day be sitting with the rest of them in her own father's dining-room, bless her kind heart and tidy figure. So it's all happened for the best, after all." It was not only Hannah the housemaid that thought thus. As the little Curlings went to rest, at an unusually late hour for them, in a grand bedstead all hung w ith handsome yellow damask, and ornamented with fringe and tassels, and upon a  thick down bed, into which they sank very comfortably that cold winter's night, with the light of a  fire to cheer them to  sleep, Emily whispered to Ralph-she had scarcely spoken above her breath  since she came into the house--- Do you know, papa's going to keep a shop again ?

And Thomas Curling said to his wife, as they settled themselves to sleep in the blue bedroom opposite--"How changed and softened my brother is! Nothing but the death of my poor nephew could have effected such a miracle." ' The Almighty could have used other means, had He seen fit," reverentially replied Mrs. Curling. "But doubly blessed are those who, not content with doing all the good they can in their lifetime, amend the world even in the act of leaving it!" D   .                      "    A Story of a New Year's Eve. X (^  HAPPY NEW YEA , and God bless you, uncle!', The voice was a very small one, but lusty enough for all that; and in the ears of Timothy Twills, parih clerk and sexton of the village of Willowley, sounded as grateful as the chink of bran-new half-crowns. "The same to you, Tim, my lad," said his uncle, who was moreover his godfather, as he tapped the lad's head patronizingly- -"the same to you, lad, and heartily. But you're too soon by some hours yet, Tim; the old year an't quite dead, though he is pretty nigh gone; there's not much breath left in his body, I'll warrant him. .He's been a given up by the doctors, and his coffin's ordered. He's made his will and is a sinking peaceably; and the New Year'  s coming post haste, Tim, and is expected in a few hours.", Mr. Twills delighted in the allegorical, and revelled in the Song of Solomon. The child gazed in wonder, and took m his uncle's poetical imagery with open mouth, while Mr. Twills passed into the cottage. The blazing firelight fell on a happy Christmas domestic circle, from which there arose,.  &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC7943-00000074"/> "8  i       eraetm a rstones. -on Tim's entrance, a Babel of unruly sounds, made cheerful with musical laughter. Three white-headed, rosy-cheeked children darted from theirrespective stations at their father's and mother's feet, and having made an assault upon Uncle Tim's legs, forcibly led him into the midst of the family circle. The mother laughingly chided the merry children, and led Mr. Twills to the post of honor in the vacant arm- chair. Then Uncle Tim had time to look around him. On his right hand, and first and foremost in the happy circle, sat the pater-familias of the establishment, an honest laborer, very rough and very brown, with very large collars, and a very warm heart. On a long seat, with a high screen-back to it, sat his wife; a blooming little woman, the very picture of happiness and good-humor, with a miniature duplicate of herself in her arms, crowing lustily in the very exuberance of animal spirits. Next to her sat an old lady (whom the children saluted as '" grandmother"), chiefly remarkable for her dulness of hearing, to remedy which she made use of what at first sight appeared to be some murderous blunder- buss, but afterwards resolved itself into a ram's horn ear- trumpet. To complete the circle, Mary, the eldest daugh- ter and owner of a pair of very wicked eyes and rosy lips, was engaged in mixing up various compounds in a large bowl from which a most agreeable odor was arising. "Guess, uncle, what it is!" she said. Uncle Tim was at a loss to divine. It smelt too good for spiced ale, that was very clear. "Elderberry wine, perhaps." No, that it wasn't! Couldn't be further from the mark. Uncle Tim gave it up in despair. "A real bowl of wassail, uncle- ale, spice, sugar, and apples, and I don't know what be. sides; ain't we grand?" Mr. Twills thought so, indeed. "You're just come in good .time, brother," said the blooming little woman. "We knew you'd call in as you went to the church to ring the New Year in, so we got-it   3 ^iter of a geir-gear's lobe.   149 all ready in time. Your tall nephew, George, is one of those who is gone to carry the wassail bowl round the vil- lage,* and as Mary and I had the making of it, they would hear of nothing else, but that we must keep a bowl for our- selves. So you see, brother, here we are making merry, and almost as grand as the squire himself." Uncle Tim had the first taste, and pronounced it a very miracle of art; an opinion soon echoed by all. Whilst they were tasting, 'in came George, accompanied by his fi'iend Dick, who'had a hearty welcome from all, and a warm clasp of the hand from Mary, in particular. They were full of tales and anecdotes of their progress round the village with the wassail: how the vicar's lady (God bless her!) had, with her own hands, graciously filled a glass out of their bowl, and said she wished them one and all .a happy new year; and how the vicar himself had made a  speech to them, and gave them not only good advice, but a handsome pre- Sent with it; and how the squire had had them all into his kitchen, and promised them a dance there for the next night; and how Dr. Pillbox had given them'this; and Far- mer Furrow that; and how old Hunks the rich miller had set his dog at them; and all the other manifold adventures of the night. Then they all got very merry; and Dick sang the funniest comic songs that the white-headed children had ever heard in their lives; and even Uncle Tim tried one with a " ri-too-ral, chorus of unlimited length, but broke down at the tenth verse, when the subject of the song had only just begun. Then Dick discovered that he and Mary sat just under the mistletoe, and this occasioned a great deal ofstrug- gling, accompanied with some squealing and remonstrance but terminating in a way very satisfactory to both parties. At last, however, it was getting time for Mr. Twills to go, * This custom is still preserved in many counties.  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC7943-00000075"/> 150I      -      Mfim# ito"eM. as he had to call in at "The Marquis of Granby," which was the village inn, for his three fellow-ringers. So, when he had been carefully buttoned up, he set out with great re- joicings, telling them that it should not be long before they heard the merriest peal that ever the four old cracked bells had rung out in honor of the New Year. But when Tim reached the inn, and was asked by his companions "just to have one glass to keep the cold out," he found it was a diffi- cult thing at Christmas-time to refuse such a hospitable invi- tation, t He quickly found himself, therefore, within the noisy circle around the kitchen fire of "The Marquis of Granby." They were a jovial party, carousing together with that friendly spirit of cordiality which the genial Christmas- time awakens in the breasts of all. There was one among them, however, who drank in moody silence and had no langh for the merry jests that were bandied about around him. He was quite one of the characters of the little com- munity, and requires a word or two in passing. When he had first come among them, the villagers had given him the cognomen of "-Black Bill," from his dark hair and swarthy features; and he had been so long known by that epithet that his real name was forgotten. He was always an idle, sulky fellow, who appeared to love nothing so well as drink- ing, and whenever he had a copper in his possession, usually found his way to the inn to spend it. How he got his living was a mystery, though report said that a certain game- dealer in the neighboring county town could inform them if he chose; and one or two suspicious-looking terriers, who were always at his heels, appeared to strengthen this sur- mise. For some months, past he had been, to all appear- ance, better off than usual, but the fact that game had been plentiful was, to their minds, proof sufficient. The fire was cheering, the brandy was exhilarating, the company were pressing, and Mr. Twills's single glass was   O ^trg of a iea-tr'a Abe.      151 trebled before he found that it was absolutely time to be off. "You go and get all right," said one of his fellow- ringers, who was loath to leave,!"and we three mates will soon follow you." So Tim set out for the church alone, and found, when he had gone out of doors, that he had had "quite as much as he could carry"-perhaps more. It was a sharp night. The crisp and frozen snow lay deep upon the ground, and cracked under his feet as he strode on. Every little branch and spray of the old elms in the avenue was gemmed with hoar frost; and through its frozen net- work he could see the pale moon sailing along through a sea of fleecy-white clouds. Timothy opened the little wicket, and passed into the churchyard. All the tombstones were standing up, quite stiff and solemn, doing penance in a man- tle of snow: each bush looked like the ghost of a departed curate  rising up in his surplice, and every grave seemed covered with a winding-sheet. To cheer himself, Tim began to whistle, but stopped, on finding that the tune was "King Death is a  rare old fellow."  Suddenly he called to mind how the last sexton-who, though reported to be a miser, yet had never paid his debts-had gone to that same church with himself and two others to ring in the last new year's peal; and how that he had been left behind by them to close the belfry, and had never been seen afterwards; and how that he had been distinctly visible to a certain vera- cious .villager (returning to his cottage from 'The Mar- quis of Granby"), darting through the belfry window enve- loped in blue smoke, and mounted on a streaming-tailed black charger, that snorted flashes of fire; and how that other people had treated this tale with scorn, and said the old sexton had chosen that night to run away from the vil. lage (where he had no kith or kin), to escape paying off lis numerous debts; and that, when his cottage was searched, not a halfpenny could be found there, which had confirmed  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7943-00000076"/> 152 -r           *itmas Stoines. their tale. Timothy had been one of those who believed this latter account of his predecessor's disappearance; now, however, he thought that the former report was not so desti- tute of credit as some people seemed to imagine. Tim knew every inch of the churchyard-that "Incincture small, Yet infinite its grasp of weal and woe-" and could find out its path just as well when it was hidden in snow, as in the sunny days of summer. Close by there was a deep grave: he had been digging at it for the last two days, for the earth was all frozen up like iron; and in the morning, on the first day of "the glad new year," the corpse was to be buried there. Timothy was pretty well used to such things, yet, for all that, he rather quaked as he saw it, and thought that Christmas was not always a merry Christmas, and wondered whether he should be alive next New Year's Day, for he remembered that the dead man, that- time last year, had been as full of life and vigor as any of them. He carried a lantern with him, whose flame threw a flickering, sickly light over the graves as he passed them by. -Tim felt he would much rather have brought     : his companions with him, or been seated at his sister's cheerful hearth; but there was no help for him; so on he went. It took him some few minutes before he could open the church door, for the snow had drifted into the key- hole; but, when he did so, what an echo there was! Tim passed on into the porch, within which was the door that led to the belfry. It was simple enough, with a stone seat on the one side, where the old dames would sit and rest on a Sunday, and drop their curtsies to the vicar and squire as they passed by; yet, somehow, Tim rather shuddered as he looked around. The cold walls presented a cheerless con- i.   tor of a Ito-f's dkt       }53 trast to the bright fireside he had just left; and the gro tesque heads that terminated the stone rib-work of the roof leered on him hideously. The plaster walls on either side were, according to rustic Englisfi fashion, scrawled d ver with rude autographs and pithy records of village celebrities, who had either been hung or sent across the seas for crime; and these, he hardly knew why, Tim began to read, The three-quarters' chime aroused him from his reverie, and brought to his recollection the task he was come upon. Removing the tressels, placed in readiness to convey the dead man to his grave on the morrow he opened the belfry- door, and began to ascend the tower i The steps were old and time-eaten, and, as Tim thought, more slippery than their wont. The wralls, when he touched them, were streaming with a damp, unearthly kind of moisture, and by the flickering light of his lantern, he could see great spiders clambering up fearfully -to their ghost-like webs. Through every little loophole the cold wind came, driving in the drifting snowflakes, and making the frozen ivy leaves rustle with a grating sound, like the noise the cords made in Ihe coffin-handles when he lowered a corpse into the grave. Phrough each crevice he had a glimpse of the white church- rard, and the graves, and the pale moon, looking down so itently upon all. There were a- good many stairs before e  could reach the top; and the y wound round and round so, hat Tim's brain grew quite dizzy and confused; so much so, amt when at last With some diffticulty he had reached the )p, he staggered, and fell with a great noise upon the lfry  floor.

They were rather longer legs than the first pair he had seen, and supported a body not quite so stout, though still of good dimensions. Tim wondered more and more, when he saw the next bell-rope occupied by another pair- of still longer legs, and a more genteelly-shaped body; but then he had got so used, to the sight, that when he saw a little man, with a very little body, and very long legs, come sliding down the fourth rope at a very rapid rate, he scarcely wondered at all. As each figure "came down at a quicker speed than the one that appeared before it, they all reached the ends of their bell-ropes at the same moment, and alighted with a jingling sound upon the belfry floor. Tim's first remark was, that they were all clothed exactly alike. He glanced rather suspiciously at their feet, but if they terminated in cloven hoofs, they were very ingeniously concealed in long-pointed shoes of crimson leather. Stock- ings of the same color were on their legs, while the rest of their bodies was clad in a fantastical dress of black, slashed with red. Each had upon his head a high conical crimson cap, decorated with a raven's plume fastened on by a repre- sentation of a skull and cross-bones. Tim had just com- pleted his survey, and was gazing at them in surprise, when they all took off their caps, and made him a polite bow. "We are come to see how you are, Timothy Twills," said the first and fattest, who spoke in a deep bass voice. "Thank you, sir," said Tim, for he thought he should lose nothing by being polite; "and I'd call you by your names, but I've never had the -pleasure of your acquainm ance.," "Yes, but you have, though," answered the fat gentle- man, rather sharply, " and pulled us about pretty roughly more than once: I'm' the Great Bell."   I nte df a Sti-ba'$  be.     165  "Indeed, sir,', said Tim, who felt quite surprised with himselffor not being frightened; "and I suppose the other gentlemen are the other Bells?" "They are," said the Great Bell. "Weare allbrothers, and all men of metal. What's that in the flask?", Brandy, sir," said Tim ; i and you're welcome to take a pull." "Tim, you're a good sort of fellow, and I like you, said the Great Bell, as he took the flask. "Give me your hand." Tim held it out, and felt that the Great Bell's hand was as cold and as hard as iron. So were those of the others, for they all shook hands with him. "Here's your health, Tim, and plenty of work to you, said the Great Bell, as he took a pull at the flask, and passed it-on to his brothers. "And pray what does Timothy Twills want here at this time of night?, "If you please, sir,", said Tim, in rather faltering accents,  "I am come to ring you to let the NewYear in., "Timothy Twills come to ring us to let the New Year in! Well, I never Ho! ho! ho!', roared the Great Bell.   "Ha! ha! ha!, chimed in the second.  "He! he ! he!", laughed the third; while the Little Bell chuckled so that he was obliged to roll on the floor, and kick his long red legs desperately in the air, before he could at all recover himself  , When the Great Bell had done laughing, and wiped the tears from his eyes, he looked at Tim very gravely, and said-  "What went with the man who  came t r ing us in last New-Year's Eve?, Tim was afraid to tell the goblin-version of the story, so he said that the individual in question had certain ly never been seen after that night, but was supposed to have run away from the village.  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7943-00000078"/> 156        ZIatma trits. The Great Bell laughed louder than ever, and the mirth of his brothers seemed quite furious. The Little Bell said it was the best thing he had ever heard in his life, and forthwith rolled off in paroxysms of delight. "Ran away from the village, did he!" said the Great Bell at length. "I say, Mr. Twills, look here;" and with that the Great Bell stooped down, and pulling two rusty nails out of the floor, lifted up a plank, and bade Tim see what was beneath. He stepped forward and looked, but started back with horror. He tried to speak, but his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth, yet his eyes were fixed on what he saw, as by a spell. In the space between the flooring and the ceiling that was beneath, *lay the cramped- up corpse of a man, whom, by his dress, for the rats had eaten away his features, Tim recognised as the old sexton. "Left the village, did he?" said the Great Bell, in a hol- lower voice than before. "Tim knows better than that now. But you come to welcome in the New Year, and we won't disappoint you. Let's be merry. Do you dance?" Tim thought of the "Dance of Death," but said nothing. "Your hands, brothers," said the Great Bell, " and we'll show him the Chimes Quadrilles." With that, the Great Bell seized Tim by the right hand, and the Little Bell seized him by the left, and round and round they all went. First they were on one side of the hole where the corpse was laid, and the next second they were on the other, and sometimes they were so close, that Tim could scarcely keep himself from tripping in, and stepping- on the body. As they danced, the Bells rang out a rude kind of music, that gra. dually grew wilder and quicker in ---its measures, as the dancers whirled round faster and faster. Louder and louder rang out the music, and quicker and quicker the Bells danced on. Tim's brain whirled round, his eyes swam, the four Bells and the corpse multiplied by hun.   itoqr of a  ttt-gt's Ofbt.    157 dreds, until, getting more and more confused, Tim could keep up no longer, but sank senseless on the belfry floor. There he was found shortly after by his three fellow- ringers, who had followed him from the inn. At first they thought Mr. Twills was dead, but finding that he breathed and snored audibly, they came to the conclusion that he was only dead drunk. His nephew George, and a few others, had followed the -ringers to assist in ringing in the New Year, and George now commenced to shake his uncle pret- ty hastily--"Holloa! Get up, uncle." "Thank ye, sir! I've-hic-danced enough," replied Tim, without opening his eyes, and under the full persuasion he was addressing the Great Bell. "Come, uncle, what nonsense this is!" continued George. "Rouse yourself, and come with -me. You know me, don't you?  Who am I?" "'The Great Bell," replied Tim, gravely. George saw that further interrogation was useless, so he began, with the help of the others, to set his uncle on his legs again. The action rather roused Mr. Twills, and, changing his manner, he cried suddenly, "Mind the corpse, there! mind, mind! You're treading on it where the rats have been." And as he talked thus, and shouted "Mur- der," they dragged him with some difficulty down the bel- fry steps into the churchyard. 1! Tim's further gone in liquor than I ever seed him before," said one of the bystanders. "This comes of making wash-butts of yourselves in beer- shops," said another. He was a tee-totaller, so he spake tri- umphantly. "For all that," said a third, "' the New Year shan't come ,in without a peal of some sort. I'll take Tim's place at the rope." And very soon the four cracked bells were heard to start off in a mad peal.  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7943-00000079"/> 158       dAtmiamas atones. The cold biting breeze that swept through the church- yard, and the judicious application of a quantity of snow to Tim's forehead, had restored his brain to something like consciousness. "Where am I?" said he.      A "Why, here, in the churchyard, uncle; where else, should you think?" "Then where's the Great Bell?" This was a poser: and the tee-totaller was heard to hazard the observation, that Mr. Twills was drunk, blind drunk. The remark caught Tim's ear, and he replied indignantly, as he became more alive to what was going on, "I'm no more drunk nor that tombstone! - But ain't it natural for me to ask for the Great Bell, when I've been dancing with him?" "Holloa! what's up now?" said George, as he checked his mirth on seeing his uncle start as though in terror. "Any ghost abroad?" "No, no!" replied Tim, hurriedly; " no ghost, George, but a corpse that you can ieel and touch. Come back to the belfry, for God's sake-there's murder been done!" Scarcely knowing what they were about, yet convinced, by Tim's earnest manner, that something was wrong, they suffered him silently-to lead them back to the belfry. The four men were pulling lustily at the bell-ropes, making the old tower rock again. A hoarse whisper from Tim stopped them; and all was still save the dying vibrations of the peal. Then Tim told them how the Bells had come to see him, and how the Great Bell had shown him the body of the long missing sexton. "I saw it plainly under these very boards; and I feel a something within that tells me it is there, and that we shall find it."  However much the group might have laughed at his tale, had he told it them when seated round the blazing inn-   4 *torg of a At3fo-ar' a     159 fire, yet now, his earnest words, the nature of his tale, and the influence of time and place, had the desired effect, and all were ready to obey Tim's commands. Snatching up a pickaxe, he began to wrench up the boards, his nephew and others aiding him. A cry of horror burst from the party when, underneath one of the planks, just as Tim had describ- ed it, lay the body of the murdered sexton! A clasp-knife, its blade rusted in the blood, that had apparently been the weapon with which the crime had been committed, was found in the hole with the body. "I should know that knife," said one of the party, intently examining it. "It is Black Bill's." In a fortnight after, Black Bill, who was now lying in jail, having been convicted by the strongest circumstantial evidence, confessed that he was the murderer. His account of his crime was briefly this,:--Te had known well enough the common report that the old sexton was a miser, and night after night had peered through the broken shutters of his cottage, to ascertain if the tale were true. On Christmas night he saw the old man count over his hoard, and lay it carefully in a secret place in the chimney-corner. From that moment he watched his opportunity; nor was it long in coming. On New-Year's Eve the old man had tarried behind his three companions who had been helping him to ring, and Black Bill slipped up into the belfry. The glad peal that had proclaimed the birth of another year, tolled a death-knell for his hapless victim. The feebleness of old age offered but a slight resistance to his savage strength, and his clasp-knife did the rest. When the murder was done, he was aftaid to carry the body down into the churchyard, so concealed it where it was found, burying his knife and all traces of his guilt with it. When this was done, and he saw by the light of the moonbeams,  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7943-00000080"/> 160        tristmas toxir. which shone accusingly through the little window down upon the very spot, that there was no trace left that could whisper to the world of his crime, he carefully locked the church door, and, proceeding to the sexton's cottage, took the price of his blood-the much-coveted gold. Tim lived long after this; but, though he often rang in the birth of a new year, yet he was never again visited by the Bells. Nevertheless, he puts the firmest faith ih their bodily existence on that one particular night; and accounts for their non-appearance at other times, by the supposition that they came for the sole purpose of revealing to him the murder of his predecessor. The schoolmaster of the village, however, who is always looked up to as "Sir Oracle," enter- tains a different theory. "You see, Tim," he says, " you had been thinking of the old sexton just before, and you had seen Black Bill at 'The Marquis of Granby's;' some thoughts, which may have long lain dormant in your mind, or even scarcely existed there, may thus have been kindled. You had been drinking largely, and you fell on the belfry floor. You then, very naturally, have the nightmare in an aggravated form, and your previous thoughts take the semblance of reality. Nothing supernatural here! Your goblin-dream may be accounted for on the very simplest grounds. In- deed, Abercrombie says"   And so he goes on. But, in spite of this, Tim resolutely maintains his own opinion; and very often, especially at Christmas-time, when seated by his sister's fireside, and Mary's blooming children (for she and Dick have long been married) look wonder- ingly into his face, then will Tim relate to an attentive and delighted audience his wonderful version of The Story of a New-Year's Eve.   Mrs, Ranford's New-Year's Dinner. T was Christmas morning. Winter had set in with December, and snow had been lying on the ground for most of the month. The whole country lay white and quiet. The sun rose this morning in a cloudless sky, and made promise of a splendid day. The gladsome bells were heard ringing out from distant villages; there was a murmur of music in the air which called forth a respondent music in the heart. The roads were beaten hard, yet, untouched by any sullying thaw, were almost as dazzlingly pure as the fields around. Through the clear, keen air went long lines of wild fowl, seeking yet unfrozen streams in this pinching time. The very rooks, tamed by severity, came into the gardens, and appealed to the com- passion of man. As the morning advanced, a fresh peal of bells from the different churches, called forth multitudes of people wrapped in overcoat and cloak, with warm gloves, and furs and muffs; and there were Happy families of old and young nodding to other happy families, and exchanging the old congratulations of a merry Christmas and a happy New  &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7943-00000081"/> 162         iistfmas itoriti Year. Soon the pealing bells rose in their kindling energy to a perfect sough and jubilance of sound, then sinking in tremulous cadence, suddenly ceased, and the congregations of the people found themselves face to face with each other and, with God. In two churches in Lincolnshire sat two men, each think- ing of the other; each known to the world as the other's bitter enemy; each regarding the other as the most vindic- tive and dishonest of men., These men did not live in the same town. The one sat in his parish church in Wainfleet, the other beneath that noble tower so oddly termed Boston Stump.  He who sat in Boston was a ruined man; he who sat in Wainfleet had ruined him. The one had been pros- perous and happy, and might have said, with many such a man before him, ' what can move me?" But all this had been changed as by witchcraft. The man of Wainfleet had dragged him down in a long and desperate struggle. The happiness of his home had been destroyed; his good name stained as by the inky waters of Erebus; his friends-all those fast friends-estranged from him! They regarded him as a base and unfeeling hypocrite. Thus sat this man, listening to the words of the collect: "Almighty God! who hast given us thy only-begotten Son, to take our nature upon him, and at this time to be born of a pure Virgin; grant that we, being regenerate, and made thy children by adoption and grace, may daily be renewed by thy tHoly Spirit through the same our Lord Jesus Christ, who liveth and reigneth with thee, and the same Spirit, ever one God, world without end, Amen!" There was a solemn murmur of "Amen!"Amen )' and the man also uttered the "Amen" with his lips, but it was not in his heart. On that heart sat the sense of hugest injuries, and burned the bitterness of intensest resentment. Wherever he looked, he saw only faces which wore the meek air of   t ISnforb'tt #eto-geart' gea ner.   163 devotion, yet those people had done him the foulest wrong; had refused to. listen to his most earnest pleadings; had combined with his foes to dishonor and ruin him. Long years of integrity had not weighed one straw in the balance with them against the artful assertions of his foes. These things rankled in his soul like fire. He saw those who had eaten at his table, laughed by his fireside, and in his social hours had seen his heart laid bare in its generous truthfulness. Some of these quondam friends occupied his ancient family pew; he himself sat in an humble and dis- tant nook, half hidden by one of the ponderous pillars of the side aisle. His wife lay at home the victim of a wearing sickness, but his only daughter sat beside him, and wept silently to herself. The ghosts of old times passed in long trains through her mind, and the words of the hymn,- "Goodwill to sinful man is shown, And peace on earth is given,"- perhaps reminded her how little goodwill had been shown to them; how little peace they found on this earth. When, therefore, the clergyman took his text-"Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I  forgive him? Till seven times? Jesus said unto him, I say not unto thee until seven times, but until seventy times seven"--the tears of the daughter fell faster, and she cast a gentle look at her father, as if imploring him to listen to that.- But on the brow of Mr. Longmore, for that was his name, there sat a hard, stern expression, and he said to himself, "  I have no brother-there is no such thing! Do I not know them?"   But the clergyman's voice was now softly and impressively calling on the congregation to re- member the new and godlike era which had commenced with the first Christmas Day. How the old and terrible  &#xD;<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC7943-00000082"/> 164        fiprxmas triet* doctrines of vengeance and blood had been thrown down from their woeful reign of ages; how the spirit of an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth, had been superseded by the spirit of love. How the angelic anthem of "Peace on earth and goodwill amongst men" had been worked out with a divine reality by the Son of God, and over the earth had gone a breath of heaven destined to cherish peace and kindness-art, and science, and literature; pregnant with triumphs, not of .blood, but of magnanimity; not of strong men over one another, but of souls over their evil passions; every succeeding age assimilating this earth more and more to the dignity and felicity of the heaven there revealed. Longmore shook his head, and said inwardly, "Bah! mere visions. After eighteen hundred years, where are the proofs? Have I not seen? Do I not know? Oh, syco- phants! sycopihants!"But his attention was again arrested by his daughter softly laying her hand on his arm. He listened. The preacher was describing the career of Christ. How, after all his deeds of goodness, and his life of love, his friends had all deserted him in the evil hour, and his foes had insulted and slain him. "And Jesus lifted up his eyes to heaven on the cross, and said, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.5 "Oh! they knew it very well," said Longmore, in his desperate mood. "They must know it. The base-wretches are always the same. Forgive them! No! I cannot for- give them. Christ might do it. He was a divine being- it is easy to God, but it is not easy, it is not possible, for me-I am but a poor, weak, down-trodden worm. NoS! no!" The tears of his daughter flowed faster, as she stooped low and buried her face in her handkerchief. It seemed as if she felt the spirit that was raging in herI father's bosom. But, meantime, what were the thoughts of the man of   Mxr. atonforbt's E6-ljtn' irtr.   166 Wainfleet? Of the lawyer who had-so triumphantly con- ducted the cause of his client, and had so completely dragged down the usurper, Longmore, as he-firmly believed him, from his proud altitude to the dust of retribution and of shame! On the last Christmas Day he had sat there in the very flush of triumph, and had thanked God that he was not such as Longmore; that he was not like him a con- victed knave, still less like him a pauper, with the memory of such past greatness. But Broadhurst, the lawyer, did not sit thus now. He was a crest-fallen, spirit-fallen man. A dreadful discovery had come upon him. He had ruined one more upright and noble-minded than himself; to elevate a worthless pretender. He had blasted a well deserved name; had struck the dagger of domestic misery into three kindred hearts; had done that which he would, if possible, give worlds to undo. He sat and wept as the doctrine of heaven's highest philosophy "Do unto others as thou wouldst that they should do unto thee," was preached over his head. "O Lord, forgive me my heavy sins! Grant me life and strength to repair what I have ruined. Touch the heart of that injured man, and turn it to forgiveness; for all things are in Thy power, and it is Thy doctrine, and Thy law." Thus ran his words in the inward tears of his soul, and to every sentiment of love and blessed retribution, his 'Amen! Amen!, went up like the flames of a heart on fire. What then had taken place between these men? But two years ago, Longmore was a wealthy wool merchant of Boston. He had led a pleasant and jolly life. His business had grown immensely. His premises were- large; his con- nexions both at home and abroad extensive; and such was his reputation for integrity and capital that he commanded the market over a vast district. He was a tall, large, florid man, of a peculiarly open and cordial character. He was  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7943-00000083"/> 166       ---it fitmaI jioint. liberal in his ideas, and the leading man in the politics and social movements of his neighborhood. His family consisted only of his wife, a quiet, pleasant woman, and a fair, blue- eyed girl, his daughter. He kept a noble table and de- lighted to have his friends about him. At that time he thought friends as plenty as blackberries, and laughed at the croaking of those moral philosophers who had for ages pro- mulgated a different idea. He dubbed them book-worms, and said they did not know life. When he went round the country to buy up the farmers' wool, his progress was a re- gular course of feasting and merriment. They all knew of his coming, and assembled their neighbors for a blithe evening. Thus Longmore made his annual rounds, despatching an extraordinary amount of business amid the overflowing hos- pitalities of farm-houses, granges, and halls. His doctrine of the prolific growth of friendship, spite of the libellous calculations of book-worms, received a grand confirmation when he was about five-and-forty, in the be- quest of a fine estate in Northamptonshire. It was the re- sult of an acquaintance accidentally made abroad; it owed everything to friendship, nothing to consanguinity. From that time till a few years turned fifty, Longmore had chiefly resided on this estate. It was a beautiful place. The house stood in a fine country, and a fine park. His business was conducted by an old faithful servant. It seemed as if For- tune was resolved that Longmore should go down to his grave in his very charitable views of human nature. But, about three years before the time we saw Long- more at hisChristmas morning devotions, the scene changed. There sprang up a man, a butcher of Gainsborough, who claimed to be the true heir to the Northamptonshire estate; and after some faint rumors, which rose and died away again, Mr. Longmore was astonished, and a good deal dis- concerted by the receipt of a letter from an eminent solici-   -n. ganforbts  d lato-Har' iarloee.  167 tor of Wainfleet, calling upon him, in the name of his client, Mr. Filmer, to restore to him the estate of his late relative, M;. John Churton. Mr. Longmore, who, with all his pleasant and $unny humor, was a peculiarly sensitive and impulsive man, read this letter, uttered his indignation in no gentle terms, and knowing that he derived his claim from his friend Churton's honest will, made in his most florid health, bade the lawyer do his worst. That worst was done. We will not travel minutely through all those years of angry exasperation. Mr. Long- more's character was high; that of his adversary, Filmer, just the reverse. We may, therefore, imagine Longmore's astonishment when the active lawyer, Broadhurst of Wain- fleet, asserted through the ablest counsel, that Longmore had taken advantage of the decayed intellects of the late Mr. Churton to concoct a will to his own advantage. We may imagine how this astonishment rose when the house- keeper of Mr. Churton, whom Longmore had himself ren- dered independent by voluntarily doubling the annuity left her by her master, was brought forward to attest the weak- ness of the testator's faculties, and that Longmore had care- fully excluded from the sick bed of Mr. Churton every one but his own family, and that the dying man had been up- held by brandy to enable him to put his signature to the deed. So well had Broadhurst laid his mine, that Longmore found himself blown, as it were, at once into the air. So well had the pleader described the wrong done to the poor and oppressed hear, whom he painted as a most deserving person, and so astounding was the evidence of the house- keeper, that a verdict was at once given in favor of the plaintiff. Longmore was at first struck dumb and senseless as by a  stupefying shock; but the impetuosity of his tem-  &#xD;<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7943-00000084"/> 168            * tjitmag itorim. per, which, during the long, smooth course of his life, had only manifested itself in generous and hasty outhursts of feeling, now very soon assumed the fury of a tornado. His indignation against what he termed and deemed the villany of the lawyer, and the black ingratitude of the housekeeper, was too tremendous to find its way out at once, but it came by degrees into action that seemed resolved to tear down everything between him and his vengeance on the plotters against him. He rushed into the contest with a vehemence which. alarmed his family and friends, and gave the most decided advantage to his watchful opponents. Trial after trial came off, the most eminent counsel were retained at the most stupendous cost, and for some time public opinion was pretty equally divided on the-merits of the case. But before the next year was at an end, Longmore beheld with inexpressible amazement, and with feelings of indescribable irritation, his enemies rapidly turning the scale against him, his friends growing mysteriously cool, and his capital ex- hausted by the gigantic contest. At the end of that period he found himself standing alone, regarded as the convicted usurper of another's rights, and his former high character only remembered to point the public astonishment at the real baseness it was supposed to have concealed. His estate was absolutely lost; he was called on to refund long arrears of income, while the prodigal expenditure in law had left him unable to comply with these demands. In proportion to his former affluence, was now the rapacity of his credi- tors. He saw himself gibbeted in the Gazette, and the : wreck of his property torn to shreds in the hands of his legal executioners. What a Christmas Day was that which passed soon after- this extraordinary change in his fortunes! Instead of the gaiety and rich banqueting at Longmore Park, with many friends around him, with laughter and rejoicing beneath the   airs. a{tforblts AboJ-Mea's inetr. 169 large kissing-bush in the servants' hall, and the brilliant dance in the old saloon, the ruined and dejected Longmore was occupying a poor house in a poor street -of his native town--that town where he had so long lived in honor and esteem. A single maid-servant waited at that melancholy table, at which sat down, in gloomy silence, Longmore, his wife, and daughter. His numerous friends, where were they? Longmore answered that question in his heart with a dreary curse, his wife with a trembling frame, and his daughter with a few silent tears. The fallen man now con- fessed that the philosophers, of all ages, were truly wise men; that he had been the fool. Experience had set its seal afresh to the ancient melancholy tenth. Between that wretched Christmas and the one following, Longmore had been employed in attempting to reconstruct a refuge from, absolute indigence, from the fragments of his former trade. There had been but one sole creature, out of his own house, who had stood firmly by him, and be- lieved him still to be a just and cruelly-used man. That was his widowed sister, Mrs. Ranford, of Blant Farm, about fourteen miles from the town. She had provided him a moderate capital, and he commenced in small premises- his former ample ones still stood empty--but they were far too great for his present means, laboring, as he did, under a ponderous load of public prejudice, and under the still more disqualifying condition of his own mind. For his whole intellectual tone was changed. He looked on his fellow men as destitute of truth and real virtue. He saw in them only selfish and malignant dissemblers. His soul was full of darkness and gall. He cared not to live, but he submit- ted to it as a necessity. His misfortunes had prostrated the never strong frame of his wife, but the wreck of his once manly, generous, and buoyant-hearted disposition had pros- trated it far more. His daughter wept bitterly and daily 9  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7943-00000085"/> 170o       eFsma. imtries. over the evidences of the frightful change which had taken place in him. All those impulses which had formerly been for good, were now perverted into impulses of deadly wrath, and deep contempt of his race. He plodded on in his business with an unconquerable spirit, but with indiffer- ent success, for there was scarcely a person with whom he had formerly dealt who did not regard him as a justly fal- len man, and whom he did not regard as false and heart- less, But already Providence was silently moving round that great system of the universe which brings truth invariably to the daylight. When Longmore learned that the final deci- sion was given against him, he drove from Longmore Park, accompanied by his wife, in precipitate haste. He was too proud to allow the emissaries of Broadhurst to eject him from the spot like a homeless dog. But Mary Longmore, the daughter, stayed behind, to pack up many little things which she could not bear the idea of leaving to the unhal- lowed hands of the butcher Filmer. She had scarcely com- pleted her task, and sent off the packages, when she ap- peared likely to encounter the occurrence which her father had shrunk from. A carriage drew up at the door, out of which she saw a number of men issue, and one was an- nounced immediately as desiring to speak with her. A young man, of handsome person, and with a frank and gen- tlemanly air, presented himself, respectfully apologizing for the cause which brought him there. "You are Mr. Broadhurst's clerk?" said Miss Long- more, somewhat astonished at the young man's appearance and bearing. "I am his son, madam," he replied, again bowing. "I am; sorry for it," replied Miss Longmore, bearing up as bravely as she could against her overpowering sensations. "I wish you had an honester business here."   god ganfoWrb' jeba-11'^ Uinerx   171 "Madam,, replied the young man, with a mixture of mildness, and yet of spirit, as vindicatingihis father; "I am well aware how this matter must appear to you, and deplore it sincerely, but we believe our business to be quite proper." He reminded her of the decisive nature of the housekeeper's testimony, and begged that they might no further pursue the painful subject. Miss Longmore, with the tears starting into her eyes, declared that God must one day expose her awful perjury. "It is quite natural you should think so," added the young man, feelingly. "It is quite natural,"- replied Miss Longmore, " because all the facts of the case have been -familiar to me from child- hood. What should there be so strange in a friend who owed his life and fortune to my father leaving that fortune to him?" "Life and fortune!" said the young man. "What is that? Of that there was no mention on the trial."5 "There was mention," replied Miss Longmore, " but the fact was borne down by ridicule. 'If you wish to hear the truth, hear it now, then. When my father was a very young man, happening to be in Calais, he saw a young gen- tleman, whom he perceived at once to be an Englishman, surrounded by a low crowd, with whom he was in conten- tion. The, crowd attempted to drag the young gentle- man away, but he manfully resisted. My father, with his usual impulsiveness, immediately placed himself beside his countryman, and demanded that the infuriated crowd should hear reason, and show fair play. But they were deaf to this, and without knowing the ground of the quarrel, my father exhorted the young man to unite with him in driving off the throng. At once, they placed themselves with their backs against the wall and in a boxing attitude, and struck some effective blows against their adversaries.  &#xD;<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC7943-00000086"/> 172         riatmas itoxiis. All foreigners have a horror of the pugilistic powers of Eng- lishmen. After no very sharp fight, the crowd took to flight, and my father was about to march off in triumph his unknown companion, when a posse of gensdarmes sur- rounded them, and conmpelled them to the presence of a magistrate. Here, when their names had been demanded, and proved, by their passports at their respective inns, to be correct, the case was heard; and as the people who had been in the fray, represented the assault to have commenced with the Englishmen, my father and the stranger, for whose sake he had entered into this dispute, were ordered a month's imprisonment in a place of confinement seven miles distant, and were accordingly marched away, handcuffed together, between two gensdarmes. "The day was already declining when they set out, and it bade fair to be night before they reached their destina- tion. As they proceeded, they took care to ascertain whether their guides understood English. They found that they certainly did not. The young gentleman in whose cause my father was thus suffering, was--Mr. Churton. He  lamented bitterly this chance, and declared that it would be his utter, ruin, for that a trial regarding an estate -this very estate --must come on in the meantime, and his absence would be the assured loss of his cause, and leave him a pennyless man. "My father, with that reckless impetuosity which has ultimately been so fatal to him, declared- at once that they would attempt a rescue. He knew if they failed that. it would be death to them, but this did not weigh a moment with him. Mr. Churton agreed, and on arriving at a soli- tary place, where four roads met in the woods, just as it was growing dark, my father and Mr. Churton suddenly inclosed each his man with his free arm, and brought them face to face between them. The gensdarmes had loaded   Mte gtrrs. 'tanforys 'RAY-1tas  carbines at their sides, but these, by this sudden movement, became useless; and the two powerful young Englishmen declared that if the gensdarmes made any outcry or resist- ance, they would at once strangle them. The men, who were of inferior strength, were so convinced of their power to carry their threat into effect, that they gave up the key of the fetters at their demand. My father compelled one of them to unlock the fetters from the wrists of himself and companion; took the carbines from the gensdarmes, threw them into the ditch full of water by the roadside, and then binding the two gensdarmes back to back with their own fetters, and securing their legs with their handkerchiefs, they left them standing in the middle of the road, assuring them that if they made any outcry, they would return and shoot them. They then made the best of their way to the neighboring coast. It was already dark when they arrived there, but hearing a boat not far from the strand, they shouted, and received an answer in English. They soon found that the vessel was an English fishing-boat, and ex- plaining their case, begged to be taken on board. But the fishermen declared that they had no dingey or small boat with them, and that if they came on board, they must wade or swim. Churton could not swim; but destruction was behind them; my father was an admirable swimmer, and a very powerful man; he encouraged Churton to make the attempt. They waded into the dark waters, but long before they could reach the boat, they were beyond their depth. The fishermen protested that they dared not come a yard nearer, on account of rocks. There was nothing else for it: my father flung off his coat, bade Churton hold fast- by his waistcoat collar behind, and struck out for the vessel. It was a case of life and death. If Churton lost his presence of mind, and flung his arms round my father, or if my father's strength failed him, they were' both inevi-  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7943-00000087"/> 174        ^tm^ itie tably lost. But Churton preserved his coolness, and by a desperate effort, my father reached the side of the boat, and both were, safely drawn on board. There, furnished with additional clothes to defend them from the cold, and with homely fare, the two young men remained for two days and nights with the fishermen, ere they put across to Dover. But there, at length, they landed; paid the fisher- men handsomely; Churton was in time for his trial, won it, and from that day, his life long, was my father's friend. "Sir," continued Miss Longmore, " it is well known that Mr. Churton was a shy and solitary man; but his intellects were as good as yours or mine. He never married, and al- ways declared, that in case of his prior decease he would leave my father his property, by whom it had been saved to him. There was no scheming, no force used. I have found within these few days abundant evidence in Mr. Churton's letters through many years to my father, both of his clear understanding, and of his unvarying resolve to make my father his heir." "Good heavens!" -exclaimed the young lawyer; " why were not these letters brought forward?" "I have told you, sir'," replied Miss Longmore, blushing, "that these facts were mentioned by my father's counsel: but the whole thing was Pso cleverly ridiculed by the oppo- site counsel, as apretty sentimental romance, that my father, very much in opposition to his advocate, insisted on this part of the evidence being abandoned, and on the counsel taking his stand on the clear integrity of the will." "'These letters, if they are what you say, madam," re- joined the young lawyer, "would prove the case beyond everything else." "I have always thought so," said Miss Longmore; " but my father became so exasperated, that he hardly knewwhat he did"'    A 1a Paniforb's A fo-Ma PMnt.   175 "I would give anything to see these letters," said young Mr. Broadhurst. "I would not have such a wrong lie at my father's door for the world, if those letters are as you describe them. Would you allow my father to see them? I mean with every precaution for their safety." Miss Longmore paused a moment, and then said, "I would." Mary Longmore left the lawyer and the officers in pos- session of Longmore Park; but she did it with a feeling of resignation which she had believed impossible. There had sprung up a hope in her bosom, which, though it seemed to arise from a very minute seed, she could not prevent taking firm hold. When young Broadhurst told his father of what Miss Longmore had said, he onlylaughed; and cried, "A most romantic story, truly!" and added, "That's a pretty girl, Tom; mind you don't fall in love with her now she has lost the estate." But before a month was over, Tom had prevailed on his father to meet Miss Longmore at a friend's house in Boston, and in presence of the lady of the house, he was permitted to read the numerous letters of the late John Churton. From that hour Mr. Broadhurst was an altered man. He saw that a huge wrong had been done-a noble-minded man and true had been cruelly hunted down, shamefully maligned, and ruined. With 4his knowledge in his posses- sion, he made a visit to the housekeeper, whose deposition had carried the day against Longmore, and charged her so solemnly and searchinglywith her perjury that she trem- bled in every limb, but remained steadfast to her tale. In a few months after, the news came that she was married to Filmer, the new proprietor of Longmore Park. The man was a low brute, and his marriage of the housekeeper came over the country like a flash of lightning breaking upon the darkness. The motive of her evidence now stood suffi-  &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7943-00000088"/> 176        F(tma Fiore. ciently revealed. In less than twelve months more, Filmer's savage treatment of her, and the terrors of conscience, had laid her on her bed. A hasty message came from her to Mr. Broadhurst; he hastened to the Park, and there, in the presence of the clergyman and a neighboring magistrate, he took down, and saw her set her hand to her confession. Her evidence on the trial was false-Filmer had bribed her with money and a promise of marriage. From the moment that Broadhurst had seen the letters of the late Mr. Churton, he resolved, if it was in his power, to remedy the evil he had so zealously, but so unwittingly, done. He did not hesitate to declare openly, that circum- stances had now come to his knowledge, which totally altered his view of the case. He sent, and candidly con- fessed this to Mr. Longmore, begged him to forgive him, if possible, and promised that not only his most strenuous professional exertions, but his fortune, should be at his com- mand to rectify the terrible error- that he had committed. "Rogue!" exclaimed Longmore; " he has got all he can by wresting the estate from me, and now his fingers itch for as much more in winning it back again!" More inveterate than ever became his resentment against the lawyer. But when the news of the housekeeper's con-. fession came--and Broadhurst was the first to communicate it, telling him that the case was now quite clear, and that the property might be recovered with ease-every one ex- pected that Longmore would "forgive and forget," and that all past differences would be ended by the happiness in prospect. This was the joyful feeling of Mrs. Longmore and Mary.- Mrs. Longmore, at first overcome by the glad tidings, soon began to show symptoms of returning strength, though this return was slow in its progress. Mary seemed to breathe a new atmosphere of happiness. Life looked to her like a bright summer morning, the brighter for the last   nigt' ganforrm . fo-Me' HCxaTIW   1" night's tliunder-storm. There wanted only the restora- tion of her father's cheerfulness to complete her felicity' But that did notcome. The mind of Longmore under- went a change, but it was not such as was universally expected. He rose from a degree of darkness and oppres- sion, but ,it was not to peace and joy. He was not without exultation, but it was dashed with the spirit of indignant vengeance.  "The fools! the villains! , he exclaimed, when any one congratulated him on the discovery of the base plot-to defraud him of his property. "Don't I know it was a base plot? Did not I' always know it? They knew it themselves-all those grand friends-of mine; they knew  me-they had known me for forty years. Was I likely all at once to become a scamp and a cheat? Do honorable men become devils all at once? Was I likely to cajole or compel any one into a faise will? Let the whole rotten-hearted world go!-I want none of it. They are all hollow--hollow as drums, and false and mean as death and sin " It was thus that Longmore felt and reasoned. But the property was not recovered. Though two months had passed since the confession of the housekeeper, Longmore had not taken a single step. He seemed to have a stern pleasure in showing the world that he did not care for it. He delighted in launching the bolts of his contempt on the whole of his species. We have seen him at church on Christmas morning, and what was the spirit of his devo- tions.' But on New-Year's Day he was going to dine at Blant Farm with his sister, Mrs. Ranford. She was a true woman! She had stood firmly by him as a  tower. "That was a woman," he said, "true as steel, genuine as God's daylight. He   believed that the, whole crawling, creeping, venomous herd of things called men, would have been long ago swept into the Red Sea, but for the sake of one or two like her." 8*  &#xD;<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7943-00000089"/> 178  -tcs tmai itoxt That day, after a hearty luncheon, Mr. Longmore mounted his gig, and set out towards Brant Farm. Little did he know that, precisely at the same moment, Broadhurst of Wainfleet mounted his gig and set out from his own door towards the same Blant Farm. The two men had to pur- sue the two sides of a rectangular triangle which, at the  distance of about fourteen miles, would bring them to a point exactly at Mrs. Ranford's gate. Had Longmore known that fact, he would have rushed again into his own house and believed the end of the world come, since sister Ranford could thus deceive him. But Broadhurst did know it, and yet he went. The fact was, that certain things had taken place which, for good reasons, neither Longmore nor the reader has yet been informed of-the right moment, it was thought, had not come. Young Tom Broadhurst had been so much struck with Mary Longmore in his interview at the Park, that, from that moment, 4e felt a wonderful persuasion that there had been some gross mistake in the whole business. He was sure that truth and goodness beamed as clearly out of those mild blue eyes, and from those handsome, amiable features, as light from the sun. Longmore could not be a very great rogue to have such a daughter; and Mary thought Broadhurst could not be a very great one to have such a son. "What a fine, fiank fellow. he seems,"' she said to herself. "How willing he seems to believe the truth. What a beautiful earnestness in seeking it out 1"In fact, there was a case, such as lawyers seldom get upon their books, a case of love at first sight.' It was a case clear, positive, and most particular;. Romeo anid Juliet themselves never stood so suddenly enchanted be- tween the hostile hosts of their two fiery houses. Tom Broadhurst let no grass grow under his feet; he soon had his father on the right track. Mary and he met-how many times? .,Well, it really is amazing how many times they   glrs. Aanforb's efB-feur's . inner,  179 found it necessary to see each other in the course of a very few weeks, to put things in a train. Mrs. Ranford was soon taken into the secret, and, with her clear, strong mind, took in the whole thing, the love affair and all, heartily. Mary passed a deal of time at Blant Farm, and Tom Broadhurst rode over there continually. It was quite necessary! But as to that love affair, neither Longmore nor Broadhurst was suffered to know a word of it. Tom said he would not for the world that his father should be suspected of hav- ing-any interest in doing justice to Mr. Longmore, but the justice itself; and as to Longmore knowing! why, they might just as well think of blowing up the gas-works and all the steam-engines in Boston and Wainfleet! Then, in- deed, Longmore would declare Broadhurst a rogue, who was for anything for his own interest! But Mrs. Ranford was resolved on an explanation, and therefore she planned the bringing together her brother and Mr. Broadhurst at her New-Year's Day dinner. It was a daring project; it struck even Mary and Tom Broad- hurst with unutterable dismay. Mrs. Longmore, who was in the secret, was terrified beyond conception; it had actual- ly thrown her into a serious relapse.' But Mrs. Ranford was a woman of a bold spirit and decisive will; she deter- mined that the experiment should be made. Mrs. Ranford resembled her brother greatly in person; she was a tall, large,. florid, and very comely woman, and ten years young- er. Her husband had been dead some    years, and Mrs. Ranford had had numbers of most advantageous offers, but, no, she declared that she was married to her dear Ned; he was only gone on the journey that she should take after him some  day. She would not have two hus- bands. Mrs.; Ranford -was a first-rate farmer; her house stood on the top of that step of country, that runs on through Lincoln, and looked far and wide over the flats  &#xD;<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC7943-00000090"/> 180        ;pxtemas itong. below; it was a good farm-house, with a flower-garden and with outhuildings, and stock that showed her manage- ment and science; she led a life very much to her taste, and ruled very much in her own way, and was resolved now to try her power over her brother. "It was time to put an end to all this heart-burning and misunderstanding;" she said, "There had been enough of it." Longmore drove that afternoon over those immense fiats that lie between Boston and Blant Farm. The air was clear and very keen; the whole country was one level sheet of-whiteness, only here and there broken by a long line of stunted willows, one of those funny little windmills that are set by the sluggish dykes to propel the water, a solitary willow-surrounded farm, with an occasional round haystack eaten out by the cattle into the shape of a huge mushroom, or a dreary stretch of black fir-trees far away in the distance. It was little more than four o'clock when Longmore was ascending the steep hill to Blant Farm, but it was already dark, piercing cold, and some fine flakes of snow made him say to himself, "V We shall have another downfall." Mrs. Ranford's dinner was not till six o'clock, but she had begged her brother to be there early, both on account of the short days and because she wanted some talk with him. It was to be a family party, with the ex- ception of Broadhurst and his son, and the clergyman and his wife, to whom Mrs. Ranford had imparted her scheme, and implored the vicar's aid in the crisis, Longmore, on entering the house, met his sister in the hall, and they embraced each other affectionately. Mary, who had been there some days, remained in the drawing- room, for she was too much terrified to venture out. Mrs. Ranford, having seen her brother relieved of his coats and wrappers, opened the drawing-room door, and purposely allowed him to go in first. Scarcely did he, however, set    HRe ganforb't 3fo-^ar' ^mntux.   181 his foot in the room, than he turned round, and with a fierce low outhurst of-"The devil!" he plunged past Mrs. Ran- ford in the direction of the hooks on which hung his hat and coat. Mrs. Ranford had probably expected something of the kind, for she suddenly opposed her large calm per- son in his way-and as he gave her a terrible look, saying --' You, sister! you!" she seized him by both arms, and said- "Brother! brother! show yourself a man and a Chris- tian. There are things to tell you that will set everything right." At the same moment Mary rushed from the room, clasp- ed his knees, and cried in agonized tones--"' Oh, father! father!"                      ,  But Longmore had by this time grasped his hat with one hand, thrust it upon his head, snatched his greatcoat with the other, given himself a furious shake loose, and dashed out of the door. The scene he left behind was awful. Mary Longmore had sunk down    on the floor where her father had left her, and was weeping convulsively. Mrs. Ranford was exclaiming-- "What a madman! What a fury! But he shallbe brought to reason." Tom Broadhurst stood over Mary, whispering to her something which only seemed to increase, if either, the vio- lence of her grief; and Mr. Broadhurst almost wept. "Stop him, Mrs. Ranford!  Send after him! I won't stand in his way. I will retire to the inn." And with that Mr. Broadhurst also snatched his hat, and rushed out. What a New-Years dinner-party! what an upshot of the experiment! Mrs. Ranford did not send   after her brother. She knew very well she might just as rationally send for Lincoln Minster; but she set about to comfort Mary, telling her never to fear-all would be right yet; , ', -  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7943-00000091"/> 1 8 her father's proud spirit should be made to bend. It was a miserable scene. Meantime Longmore had hastened into the stableyard, where his horse was not yet got out of his harness-made the man put him in again in desperate- speed, jumped into the gig, and drove off. The snow was now falling in mass- es-,a keen east wind drove it into his face and bosom--it was pitch dark, and neither man nor horse could tell which was road, and which was not. But the storm within Longmore's breast raged far more fiercely than it did with- out. He lashed his horse, and whirled on. But even the horse began to slacken, spite of the whip, and betrayed unmistakable symptoms of uncertainty and reluctance to proceed. Longmore gave him somme unmerciful cuts, which for a while sent him forward at a good rate. But again the poor horse stopped; and in response to the whip only reared, wheeled aside, and refused to go. None but a madman would attempt such a road on such a night. The horse evi- dently thought so; and, therefore, in spite of the murderous inflictions of Longmore's whip, stood stock-still. At length Longmore saw that it was of no use to urge him. "Fool!" he exclaimed; gave the rein a pull to the left, and the poor animal, joyfully obeying the hint, turned, and proceeded at a rapid rate towards the farm. He would have stopped at Mrs. Ranford's gate; but again Longmore applied the whip, and the gig rolled expeditiously on to the village- inn. Here Longmore flung the reins on the horse's neck, and stalked into the house. There was a considerable crowd of laborers drinking: and smoking in the common room, who, as well as the landlady, stared to see him enter. -"Putiup u my horse," he said;. and was proceeding to en. ter the parlor, "I beg your pardon, sir," said the landlady; -"but that room is engaged."   arx. XUanfarb 't--gS ^itner     183 "Show me another, then," said Longmore. The land- lady opened another .door, saying- "But there is no fire, sir!" "Then make one, said Longmore, gruffly; and enter. ing flung himself on the sofa, in his snow-covered clothes and hat. The landlady quickly brought a light, and attempted - to light the fuel already in the grate; but the sticks were damp. They refused to kindle, and the poor woman hastily clearing out the grate, brought forth wood and live coal from the kitchen. In vain! The chimney was damp; the smoke drove down, and filled the room; Longmore bade her angrily let the fire alone, and go. She made her exit in evident alarm. Longmore sat gloomily on the sofa. The room was deathly cold; the smoke filled his eyes and lungs with its sharp, suffocating vapor-he looked round and wished him- self dead.  But something now caught his attention. The room was only divided from the next by a thin wooden par- tition. The landlord was holding a garrulous talk with some guest there, and every word he uttered was as audi- ble as if in the room itself. Longmore started. He heard his own name. Yes!-there it was again. "So he's likely, I hear, to get the property back again. They say the old woman has peached; but I know not. If she was bought one way she may be bought another, and Longmore is a  determined man." "Silence!" -said another voice-it was no other than that of Broadhurst-Longmore trembled with excitement at the sound. "Silence!).-said Broadhurst--"I cannot allow you to say a word against Mr. Longmore. I tell you, and /if any man: should know, he has been foully injured and misrepresented. It was all a mistake, and that bad woman clenched it. No! Longmore--and  I beg you will -everywhere say so, from me-Longmore, from what I have  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7943-00000092"/> 184     r    nstrmas etaoie. lately learned, is as noble, true-hearted a man as ever lived. Sir, I would give my right hand to do him justice; and justice, if there is a God in heaven, he will yet have done him." "Lord-o'-mercy!" exclaimed the landlord, " do you say so?" "' Yes, I say so," replied Broadhurst; " till justice is done to that man the load of a mountain lies on my heart." Longmore turned deadly pale as he heard these words. He sank down again upon the sofa, whence he had started on hearing these voices, laid his head on the table, and seemed shaken by some terrible convulsion. In another minute he rose up, still pale, but with an eager look passed out of the room, entered that where Broadhurst was, and, putting out his hand to the astonished lawyer, said, "I heard what you said-I believe you." The lawyer, still more astonished, and looking as if an apparition had suddenly stood before him -yet clutched at the offered hand-seemed to groan out rather than speak- "Almighty God be thanked i" and the two desperate foes stood thus till a gush of tears appeared on Broadhurst's face. "Now, God be praised, all is right," Broadhurst again ejacu- lated. "Yes!-all is right!" repeated Longmore. "You must dine with me," said Broadhurst. "Good God, what have I not to say to you?" "Nay," said Longmore, "we must not dine here. Think how we left them at my sister's. We must go there at once." "Ri;ht! Right Right!" said Broadhurst, and the next moment the astonished people in the kitchen saw these two men, who for years had been engaged in such a deadly strife, going arm-in-arm swiftly out of the house. What the state of affairs was at Mrs. Ranford's may well be imagined. Mary was overwhelmed with the most vehe- ment grief; Tom Broadhurst stood over her, holding her hand, and every now and then bidding her to be comforted   EFxi  Hnforb' 't,-m-^r?lxn mt. 185 --all would go well yet-all the time looking himself a picture of despair. Mrs. Ranford, after marching to and fro in great agitation, and abusing her brother heartily as the most obstinate of animals, had sat down moodily in her easy-chair by the fire, and seemed more in a state of deep anger than of sorrow. Her scheme had failed signally, as every one had told her it would; she had, to all appearance, aggravated affairs dreadfully; she was too much mortified to be really sorry. The clergyman and his wife came in. ' They saw at a glance what had happened. A few indignant words from Mrs. Ranford, and Mary's tears, told everything. There fell a deep and blank silence on the. party. What a New-Year's dinner-party! Never was there such a scene of utter desolation. In the midst of it came a violent ring at the' bell. All were startled. Mary Longmore gave a shriek, and stood trembling with clasped hands and death- like face. "Something dreadful has happened to that wilful man!" exclaimed Mrs. Ranford, going impetuously towards the door. At that moment the door opened, and Longmore and Broadhurst entered together. Before any of them could recover from their astonishment, Longmore said, "It is all right!" and caught his sister in his arms, and embraced and kissed her outrageously. Then he caught his daughter to his heart, who, at those words, flew to him, and embraced and kissed her still more outrageously. Then he shook hands with Tom Broadhurst and the clergyman, both to- gether; and they shook his hands, and he shook theirs again; and then he would most likely have kissed the clergyman's lady, only she and Mrs. Ranford were most passionately kissing and crying at one another at the very time. Never was there such a hearty, cordial, general recon- ciliation and felicitation. Longmore seemed at one effort to have flung off all his gall and misanthropy. , In the midst of their joy, they seemed. to forget the other great event of  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7943-00000093"/> 186         iabma intarie. their meeting-the dinner; the hour was long past. No- body before had had any inclination to eat, from sorrow; now they had forgotten it, for joy. But at length, up came the turkey, up came the roast beef, up came the game, the plum-pudding, and all the tarts, mince-pies, and knick-nack- eries; and what a dinner was there after all! How trium- phant Mrs. Ranford looked! Her generalship had succeed- ed after all. How bright Mary looked; how pleased Tom and his father looked! and as for Mr. Longmore, he never seemed so large, so florid, so jovial; all his old jollity and grandeur of good-heartedness seemed come back again at once. Everybody wondered, as they came to look at each other, and smile at each other, and talk to each other, how in the world it was possible that people, so excellent as they were, and so made for each other's society, could have made such a dismal blunder as they had made. Mary observed, with a quiet smile, that Oliver Goldsmith had explained it all long ago. "How so?" asked her father, astonished. '"How could he, when he did not know us?" "Well," said Mary, " he must have known us, or people exactly like us-for he said that all this sort of thing came of people not knowing one another." "God bless us!" said Longmore, looking quite astonish- ed, " how precisely true that is! Let us drink to Oliver's immortal memory.". "4 With all our hearts!"was echoed from all sides of the table. "And add, 'God bless us,' to it," said the clergyman. - "Bravo!" said Broadhurst-"Oliver Goldsmith, and God bless us!" The toast was drunk amid a strange accompaniment of smiles and tears.

The speedy recovery of Longmore Park; the repur- chase of the ample old wool warehouses, for Longmore would rebuild all his old trade again, and make his rounds amongst his former friends again; the marriage of Tom and Mary, and a score of other good things which all sprang from the happy change begun -by Christmas, and complet- ed by Mrs. Ranford's New-Year's Dinner. * .  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7943-00000094"/> A Merry Christmas. 4; 4; (^GH! merry Christmas indeed! I wonder what people mean by talking such nonsense; per- *I^4^t feet anomaly-never was such a thing. Snow, Waits, and bills; and no end of beggars. I don't see any- thing merry in THAT. I hate Christmas. I don't believe anybody ever was merry at Christmas, or ever will be, except a parcel of stupid children, who come home from school, and eat plum-pudding till they're sick. I'm glad I never was married, for then I should have had a lot of noisy brats coming home for the holidays, making the house untidy, and"--the soliloquist looked round his dull, cold room, and a large, old-fashioned watch, in a case, on the table, ticked loudly, and its sound recalled years-years gone by-when HE, too, had come home for the holidays, -for that watch had been a Christmas-box from his grand- father. Had not that been a merry Christmas? Oh, yes! merry as the light and innocent heart of childhood could make it, in glad companionship with mirthful beings like itself. But who in that hard-featured man could trace the merry child? Cares of the world-sins of the world-had ^ ,1-   3 Utreg xtritdmas.      189 trampled down the flowers of youth and innocence. Bright dreams of boyhood had been chased by stern and dis- appointing realities-visions of a brilliant future faded to-a dull present-and warm, devoted love, chilled and checked by the cold precepts of worldly policy. No wonder, then, that such years had effaced all joyous feelings from the withered heart, of old Peter Pringle. "Yes," he continues, answering his own thoughts, "that's all very well; but I have seen a great deal since then,-aye, aye, a great deal indeed. Confound those fel- lows, ' froze out gardeners,' don't believe they ever were gardeners, or that they know what 'froze out' means. Here, take that, do; go into another street with your noise, and say frozEN out next time, you stupid fellows. Ugh! it's enough to freeze one's blood to open the window; what the deuce I did it for I can't think. If there is a thing I hate, it's street cries: that muffin boy works me into a fever, saying, 'muffins-crump-muffins,' just as if he could not say crumpETS; and when I asked him what he did it for, he said, because he'd got a sick mother at home, as if it would do his mother any good to leave a syllable out of a word, dolt! Two shillings a week is cheap to get rid of the nuisance, and I should think that was doing his mother most goad. "Did you   give the boy his money, Martha?" he said, turning to an old woman, who slowly walked into the room. "What boy? Here's a letter for you." "What boy! why that muffln boy," replied Peter, gruffly, taking the letter. "Oh! well, how  should I know who you meant?-in course I did:" and, as'slowly as she entered, the old dame retreated. Poor old Martha! she had followed the fortunes of  &#xD;<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC7943-00000095"/> 190         ristma Afonrcs. Peter Pringle for sixty years. In his childhood she had played with him in the nursery, when on a visit to her mother, Mrs. Pringle's cook; in his boyhood, she had- fetched him home from school, when installed as nurse-girl; in his manhood, she took care of his chambers; and now, in his old age, she is his housekeeper and general servant, at his present house in Camberwell. From such long in- tercourse, they were as much alike as possible, spoke alike, thought alike, looked alike, respected one another, nay, loved one another, as much as either was capable of so tender a feeling, and called one another '"Little Martha," and "Master Peter," as they had been accustomed to do for as long as they could recollect. So much for his establishment. His house, though filled with furniture, as comfortable as money could make it, for Pringle Was no niggard where his own comfort was con- cerned, yet bore the stamp of solitude, and, with all its luxury, looked desolate; and often, very often, did Pringle find it so, for no -friend rested on those well stuffed chairs- no one came to see him, save an old client, who paid him a formal visit once or twice a year, more from habit, and for a glass of fine old port, than for any other reason ;-and to-morrow would be Christmas-day, yet no-one was coming to dine with Peter. There was to be no pleasant assembling beneath-the roof of that dull house. He had given Martha leave to have some friends, but she had answered, "Thank you'; I'm like you, I ain't got none." So an excellent dinner Peter ordered for himself, and Martha was to dine after him,-he certainly did his best to make himself happy, but never succeeded, for to a discontented mind there is no hap- piness. He paid poor-rates, and gave to several charitable institutions, for then, he said, he had done his duty, and would not be worried with' tales of distress. s '   3 lltrxg epaitmaa.       191 "Well, I'm sure, what's this start for?" he said, looking at and opening the letter. ' Want something, I dare say; wish to Fate they'd take all my money, and leave me alone ;--going fifty miles in a deep snow for what?-to be wished a ' merry Christmas!' Ugh! to see people laugh- ing, and eating, and passing a merry Christmas-in a clergyman's house, too; mirth and parsons not synonymous,-- not synonymous; hate parsons;)" and flinging his letter on the table, he paced up and down the room. He walked to the window. It was growing dusk. Bright fires were throwing a ruddy glow on the ceilings of the opposite houses. People were hurrying along the streets, many with parcels, Christmas-boxes for to-morrow; omnibuses passing, filled with men from offices, bringing home game from market, laughing sand joking, gladly looking forward to the morrow's holiday; and the muffin boy hurries along to-night; it is Christmas-Eve, and he wants to get home. to " faher and mother," the fourpenny piece which has just been given him, holding out a dim and shadowy perspective of toast and ale, and "father and mother," and little Jack's ecstasy thereat; and then comes the lamplighter, in an extreme bustle, as if he had laid a wager to light all the lamps in the neighborhood in the space of a moment, and he cuts a caper and a joke at the same time, as he scampers up the ladder, saying, he is " throwing a light on the subject,, not new perhaps, but causing a great fit of laughter to a boy, who has always held the lamplighter in the greatest respect for his wonderful agility, which he has often longed to imitate. And now it is, darker still, and a hackney coach t" draws its slow length along," and stops before the opposite house; and the hall-door opens instantly-pleasant symptom of having been watched for, and anxiously expected-and out tumble-for there is no other word so expressive-four or  &#xD;<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC7943-00000096"/> 192        ( rtfitnima Won. -five children, in new rose-colored dresses, and mamma and papa also very smart, and then, at the foot of the staircase, there is such a kissing, and little arms are twined round little waists, and little folks lugged up stairs by other little folks; and the door is closed; and then the shadows on the blind in the drawing-room show they are there, those merry hearts, and Pringle turns from the window with an impa- tient c Pshaw!" Oh! how cold and cheerless his room looked; it was dark, much darker than out of doors, and the fire had got low; and the gas lamp was shedding a ghastly light on the ground; and with a slight shudder he said, "I will go to- morrow."3 It was not the warm, affectionate letter which decided him--not the sweet words, "Do come, dear uncle, and we will all try to make you happy "--no, nor a feeling of affection for those who were inviting him, that made him consent; it was because he thought he should be more com- fortable there than at home. So he rang the bell for Martha. "I am going down to the Austins," he said, as she slowly entered the room. "What for? When?" "What for? Because I like it. When? To-morrow. So put a shirt and some socks in my bag, and all the things I'm likely to want." "Very well, then, I'm to stay here by myself-pleas- ant ;" and with her usual slow pace she walked out again. This speech sounded -unkind, but Martha did not mean it; she could not help being uncouth; there was a bearish sort of love about her, too, for himn; she fancied no one could or would take the care of him that she did, and there- fore was not slow in dampening his ardor for leaving his home, whenever such a wonderful event was proposed to her; and even now she delayed packing his things, in the hopes that sleeping on it would make him change his deter-    ^ mg (ristmase.       193 mination. ' But no; he had made up his mind, he is not to be moved, and, by eight o'clock in the morning, he is some miles on the Great Western Railway. We must precede him to his destination. It is a lovely Christmas morning. The red sun is shedding a glow on the snow, lying in beautiful shapes on the branches of the trees and making even an old tub, or plank, apicturesque object. Mr. Austin's parsonage is a sweet place, standing in a beau- tiful garden thickly wooded by pine trees, above which peeps the grey spire of .the church.- Gentle Mary Lester is his ward, and niece to Peter Pringle, The mother married against his will, so when she and her husband both died, leaving little Mary a pennyless orphan, he refused to see her, or take her to his own home, but consented, if he might be spared all future annoyance with her, to pay Mr. Austin to take charge of her, with a promise of a wedding portion, if she married according to his will. Repeatedly had they asked the stern old man to come and see them, but he had always refused; however, they could not bear he should be alone at Christmas, and so now again they had made the request, and this time, no one could-tell why, had succeeded. And busy enough they were at the parsonage this morning, doling out Christmas gifts to the poor, and preparing to go to church, there to return grateful thanks for being permit- ted, another Christmas Day, to assemble beneath its venera- ble roof, without one blank in their little circle. The Aus- tins had only one child, a girl sixteen years of age, and she and Mary Lester were inseparable; every secret of their hearts was confided to each other, and they could not believe that any circumstance of after life could destroy the enviable friendship subsisting between them. And who would seek to weaken this happy trust-who undertake the cruel task of telling those young hearts how soon the min, glingwith the world would wean themfrom each other-bow 9  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC7943-00000097"/> 194        *D;xistmtrt jtoxtr. nearer and dearer ties would come between them, and they wouldlive to say, "How, when we were young, we loved one another!" She was a pretty, fair-haired, bright-eyed creature, little Agnes Austin, and used to bound about the house-like some spirit; she seemed in every place at once; you scarcely heard her ringing laugh in the hall, but she stood before you; and as to walking, it was a thing she seemed hardly able to do; notwithstanding her quiet mother's constant assurance that there was no hurry, she never did anything so common as to walk quietly across the room; her light- heartedness, light-footedness, and light-hairedness, obtained for her the nickname of fairy," and by such, was she always called. Mary Lester was not pretty, but she was lovable and interesting, quiet, steady, and cheerful; being remarkable for neither beauty nor wit, she was unattractive to the com- mon observer; but those who knew her high principles, and her unflinching performance of her duty in its strictest sense, loved her as she deserved to be loved. How parti- cularly comfortable Mr. Austin's library does look; such a. famous fire, such a lazy cat lying before it, such a bright kettle boiling on it, such a nice breakfast laid on such a White cloth, that actually looks white notwithstanding the snow, which has such a saucy knack of making everything look yellow; and, better than all this, such a party assem- bled at breakfast-such a contented, grateful, happy party, not one among them who does not look up in his neighbor's face with a look of love. What room, then; would not seem comfortable? "Papa,', said Agnes suddenly to her father, who was engaged in that, to most men, important occupation, read. ing the newspaper ;- Papa--dear-'" no answer: again she said, "Papa dear, now you shall not read another line   B  fcg Ijri;mas        195 till you answer me;"- and she covered the portion of the paper he was reading, with her hands.- "Xow can you be such a goose, said Mary, smiling, as to imagine that your tiny hands can prevent Mr Austin seeing; he is still reading, you know., "Ah! but it has made him look up, though,", she answered, as Mr. Austin peered over his spectacles at the merry face of his darling little daughter. "Now dv tell me,) she continued, " do you think he's a bear?" "Eh ! Oh! I think he's a bear? Who's a bear? "Mr. Pringle., A bear, my love! Oh! dear me, I hope not for all our i sakes, and especially for yours, for he will most assuredly make but one mouthful of such a tiny thing as you, my "Oh, now, don't be silly, Papa, pretending you don't understand me.

"Well, how funny, I never knew that before; what is he like, Mamma; shall I be very frightened at him?, "No, my dearl; I hope not, he is not very formidable in appearance, and I think a little gentle kindness will go far towards softening his harsh manners; poor man, he has been embittered in early life, and to him goodness and hap- piness are but names." "It must be our care, therefore, dear Agnes," said her father, "to undeceive him, to show him that both can and do exist, and though not pelrmitted to enjoy them here perfectly, yet our proper efforts to obtain them will be  &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7943-00000098"/> 196       CStistmas .itores. rewarded with a very fair amount of success. You believe in goodness and happiness, do you not, Mary?" he said with a significant smile. Mary laughed and blushed, and thensaid: "Yes, I believe you are good, and I' am happy." "Exactly, of course you cannot think of any one else in  the world, whom you think good, excepting your poor old Guardy." A loud ring at the bell announced a visitor. '"Here he is!" said Agnes, springing from her chair. "Who, Frank?" said Mary, starting from hers. "No, no, your uncle, Mary," answered Agnes. "Oh!" she said, reseating herself very calmly. Mr. Austin laughed. "What a shame, Agnes, to startle people so, and then disappoint them; but you're wrong, I see, unless Mary's uncle is done up in a brown paper parcel,' he continued, as the servant entered with one in his hand. 1"For Miss Lester." "La! Mary, who from? What fun! oh! cut the string, make haste;" but Mary with a very glowing face con- tinued undoing the knots, and when Agnes's patience was quite exhausted, she took from the folds of paper a very elegant desk. "Well, I am sure, a Christmas-box, indeed, and a very handsome one,", said Mr. Austin; "' now the only difficulty will be to discover the giver : suppose you take it into your own room, Mary, and hunt through it well, you may find a note to explain." In a very low voice, but with a smile of very great plea- sure, she answered, "I had the explanatory note by the first post."  "Oh! indeed, then so long as you are in the secret, we will ask no questions ;now, Miss curious Agnes, leave Mary's present alone, and go and dress for church, or you wi'l be   3 gtmrg 6iriatm.       197 late. Mary must remain at home," he continued, " in case of her uncle coming." "Oh! certainly," said Mrs. Austin, and so it was settled. Agnes soon came down, muffled up in furs till her small bright face peeped out like a flower hidden in a mass of foliage, and they started for church, leaving Mary to receive her uncle, whom she awaited with a nervous dread. They had not been gone ten minutes, before she received the awful summons to come down to him. "Oh! how do you do? You're Mary Lester, then?" "Yes! dear uncle!"5 "Ah! not a bit like your mother; she was a very pretty woman at your age. Where are the rest?"5 "Gone to church."' "Church! Ugh! in this weather? It's enough to give one an ague to think of it; I haven't been to church for ages.5" "I should think not," was Mary's mental rejoinder. "They left word you were to have anything you wanted, dear uncle, directly." "Then, I want summer." "Oh! that," said Mary, smiling sweetly, and helping him off with his greatcoat, " is impossible for us to get you, but we will make you fancy it such, by a warm fire, and warmer welcome."  "Oh! pooh! get me something to eat!  The bell was rung, and some refreshment ordered; and Mary assisted him to it so charmingly, and moved about him so quietly, and the room was so comfortable, and he was so unused to the charm of a nice woman's society, that he actually appeared gradually softening, and even stooped and patted the cat, instead of kicking it; and when the animal, after rising and stretching herself, purred round his legs, and finally jumped on his knee, he almost looked pleased, and said, "La! bless me, I never saw a cat do that  &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7943-00000099"/> 198        dI;istmas foter. before; what does it see in me?" Nothing could exceed the kindness of his welcome from the Austins on their return from church, and installed in a snug arm-chair, by a blazing fire, reading, the rest of the party seated round him, Peter Pringle had never felt so comfortable. Did he cast- one thought on poor old Martha, alone, in his dull house? No, not he ; he was comfortable, and therefore il never occurred to him that any one else could be otherwise. The day almost flew away, so quickly the hours passed, and at five o'clock arrived the company to dinner. Mrs. Austin's married sister, her husband, and three children; Mr. Aus- tin's father and mother; Mr. Wentworth, and Mr. Jones, the nervous curate, whom Mr. Austin always made a point of inviting; for his family lived many miles away, and the kind-hearted rector endeavored to make him feel that Heathcote Parsonage was his home. Mr.. Jones had, unfor- tunately for his peace of mind, been there a little too often, for he found that, instead of writing his sermons, " sonnets to Agnes v flowed from his pen; his blotting-paper was covered with faces, all bearing the same expression; in his drawer, and in his desk, were faded flowers, pieces of rib- bon, and scraps of writing, all treasures from the parsonage; and in short, poor Jones was irretrievably in love. There were few things more amusing than to see Agnes ensconc- ing herself in the most extraordinary corners, to avoid the necessity of sitting next to Jones, and to witness her saucy indifference, her loud answers to -the tender nonsense he was whispering; the sort of dread with which she would place her tiny hand in his gaunt one, and then draw it away so quickly. Poor little thing, it was no wonder she did not love him-he was a strange, tall, awkward, uninteresting creature; and it was no wonder that he loved her-she was indeed a captivating little being. With the perversity of man, the more indifferent she was to him, the more he   - Im trg }rtismas .    199 seemed to love her; and his odd little brown eyes never moved from the bright form of the tormenting little beauty. Frank Wentworth could find quite as good occupation for his eyes under the hospitable roof of the parsonage, for he had resigned his heart to the keeping of the gentle Mary; and in a desperate state of excitement was the gentle Mary this afternoon, for fear either hers'or her lover's deportment should betray the state of affairs, ere her uncle had been prepared for it by Mr. Austin, and his consent gained. They had none of them doubted obtaining the consent, but they felt the testy old man would like to be acquainted with the fact as speedily as possible. At length Mr. Austin decoyed him out of the room, and a long and alarming time they were gone; and when they did come back, anxiously was Mary's gaze riveted on their faces. Peter Pringle looked exactly as he had done before; but Mary fancied in Mr. Austin's face there was a shade of care and anxiety--but Mary hoped it was only fancy, and placed her arm through Frank's, and gazed up in his face with such a look of love, that the arm was in consequence very fondly pressed, and she forgot that any one could object. "It's cosier without the candles, I think,-I like the fire light, don't you?' said Mr. Austin; many voices answered, "Yes." Who would disagree with him! The warm delicious light of -a bright fire, its playful, changing, spirit-like light, now bounding up the chimney, astonishing the quiet grey smoke, then suddenly disappearing altogether, then rushing out at the bars in a great bustle, then flickering gently, as if it never was in a hurry, and all the time keeping up a click- ing, sparkling, comfortable sound, seeming to invite you all to draw round it, and see how warm and cheerful it is; and so some of our party did now. The old folks, Mr. and Mrs. Austin, and Jones, talked over it; the children and Agnes  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7943-00000100"/> 200        ^rtdmas Sis. got at high romps, and in a corner, where the fire had thrown a deep shadow, sat Frank and Mary. Old Pringle unfortunately kept peering into that corner in such a fid- gety way, that at last Mr. Austin said very pointedly--"We had better have candles now." So the candles came, and Mary and Frank moved from the corner-Mary with a very high color saying, how strong the light was; and Frank pretending to be quite aware what they were all talking about, rushing into the middle of the conversation in the most inappropriate manner. Dinner was then announced, and the appearance of the board, so well covered with good cheer, had a wonderful effect upon all parties; dinner was always an important point with Pringle, so his face assumed its pleasantest ex- pression. Mr. and Mrs. Austin, senior, began to talk of sundry Christmas Days they remembered. The children, who, perched up before dinner on high chairs, their little feet dangling, had looked blue and frozen, began rapidly to thaw; and Agnes, who had managed to get between them, was chattering away to them about dolls and dolls' houses. Frank and Mary were murmuring together like two doves, unconscious whether they were eating roast, beef or stewed horse-shoes; and so poor Jones was the only uncomfortable looking being among them-away from Agnes, and obliged to carve the turkey!-pity him all ye who are in love, and do not like carving. Like the woman with her matches, who hoped nobody heard her, he hoped nobody saw him, and vainly hoped nobody wanted any; vainly did he throw out hints about its being unlucky not to eat beef on Christmas Day, every one would have turkey; and old Pringle's sharp voice and sharper remarks invariably made him start so dreadfully, that ere the dinner was over, the state he was in would have cured the most dreadful cold in the head ever known.   3 UTaxi (ft4t    201 ,     ! It was over at last, and they adjourned to the drawing- room. After tea, a game at forfeits for the children was proposed, which not at all suiting Mr. Pringle, he took his way to the library, grumbling all the time at the " confound- ed noise." Mr. Austin followed him. "Excuse me for troubling you again, Mr. Pringle, but I love dear Mary as my own, and cannot bear to make her unhappy--I must, therefore, try to make you relent." "It's no good teasing,-I never alter my mind; he's too young and too poor; long engagements are detestable things; and as they're not to be married, they'd better not be looking dismal at one another; so do as I advise you, pack off that fellow-if not, you know the consequences- they will marry, I shan't give them a farthing, and shall leave my money to old Martha or a hospital. There now, don't talk to me about that any more." "But, indeed, sir, you are too liasty,-Wentworth is an excellent young man, but a man of strong and deep feeling; such a blow to his hopes, just as he is starting in life, will do him incalculable mischief; his employment will no longer have charms for him, and you will drive him perhaps into misery and vice." "Let 'em marry, then, it's nothing to me." "' But a little assistance from you, sir, would enable them to marry comfortably and without anxiety." "I'll do nothing of the sort, I tell you, so don't talk any more about it."       * - With a sigh of despair, Mr. Austin walked out of the room, and old Pringle took his large watch out of his pocket and put it on the mantelpiece, and gazed at it long and fix- edly, at its old 'vhite face and slowly moving hands; and as he gazed, a dim, thin film seemed to gather over it, which grew thicker and thicker, and larger and larger, and Prin- gle held his breath, and his hair stood on end; for from that 9*  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7943-00000101"/> 202        Qljtinsa Soies. film came forth a shadowy form--it was a man with a scythe and an hour-glass. "t Who art thou?" said Pringle, tremblingly. -"I am he who makes of the young child an old man; of the chrysalis a gaudy butterfly; one often prayed to come, and often prayed to go, yet who never comes twice. I bring tears, yet soothe all woe, and have the blessings of the worn and wearied hearts, for I bring thbm a peaceful rest at last; one whom YOU have badly used-and I have come to tell you so-I AM TIME. Sixty years I have been with you, and what use have you made of me?" "I have worked hard," murmured Pringle. "To what purpose? You have gathered wealth for your own comfort. What benefit has it been to your fellow- creatures, what advantage has your knowledge been to them? whom have you comforted by kindly words? who has profited by your good example? And now that your strength is failing, and your eyes growing dim with age, you have not the support of one good action to lead you to your grave. "Look back on your past life-think what it was made ,you the hard unyielding being that you are,-and I will stay by you yet a little while, that you may have the chance of a fellow-creature's blessing to gild the rays of your setting sun. Stay, a spirit shall assist you." And Pringle, with his strained eye-balls glaring on the form before him, beheld another rising by its side, a female form, tall and graceful, bearing in its hand a large roll of paper; its robes were of cloud-like texture, and its face fair  and beautiful, but changeful in expression; occasionally sad -so sad!-then beaming with joy, "Spirit of Retrospection, unfold thy tablets!"And the spirit slowly unwound the roll of paper, and held it before Pringle. What does he see? A child at prayers beside its   t emtZg 6rsntfma.        203 mother's knee; that fades away, and in its place there is a group of children in a large room, decked with holly. From the middle of the ceiling hangs a large branch of mistletoe, and beneath it is a fair-haired boy, bearing the lineaments of the child Pringle had first seen, his arm wound round the neck of a pretty little girl,- striving to free herself from his embrace; at the boy's side hangs a watch; this passes quickly-Oh! so quickly-and a young man is seen in its place, and by his side a girl weeping; and he is holding her hand in his, and looking in her faces with looks of love. Another figure appears--a tall, stern man--and, with an iron grasp, wrenches the girl's hand away. Pringle covers his face tightly with his hands, and his frame shakes violent- ly, as in a suffocated voice he says, "Spirit, have mercy!- let me forget that." lie raises his head; the picture is past; --but another is there-the young man grown older, mluch older-the brightness of youth is gone--he is seated at a -desk in an office, -and before him stands again that stern man; but where is the proud, haughty bearing which once was his? All passed-pale and thin, and wretchedly dress- ed, he seemed to stand a suppliant before the young man, whose happiness he had so blighted. He is pointing be- seechingly to a heap of gold lying on the table; but the young man covers it with his hand, and, with a smile of scorn, shakes his head, and points to the door. Pringle clenched his hands convulsively. "Enough, enough--spare me; Spirits, I  beseech you; I  can bear no more; he did not say SHE wanted it." The Spirits answered not, but in silence continued their work. A wretched room is before him now. On a mise- rable pallet lies a young girl, and kneeling by her side, hold- ing her wan hand, the same stern man. Hush! she--speaks! "Oh! tell him I blessed him with my last breath." A bright, bright light is on the picture, and it is gone;  &#xD;<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC7943-00000102"/> 204       (!Ludmas toxic.. and tears--aye, tears-are flowing down Pringle's cheeks,- and bitter sobs choke his utterance. When he raised his head again-Time alone was with him. "Oh-! I see it all--all-now; but was there not much- excuse for me? I had loved Ellen fondly-oh! so fondly. I had worked .with but one aim-to make her my wife; and then that he, with no reason, should part us. Spirit, it was hard to bear; it blunted all my better feelings." Time moved his hand, and a voice said, "WENTWORTH IS AN EXCFLTTNT YOUNG MAN, BUT A MAN OF STRONG FEEL- ING; SUCH A BLOW TO HS HOPES, JUST AS HE IS ENTERING INTO LUFE, WILL DO HM INCALCULABLE MSCHEF." "Who was that?"--"Aye, who WAs that?" the Spirit answers, " and with the knowledge of what embittered your own life, you would so crush and blight another's. What was your answer to Mr. Austin? Where was the recollec- tion of your early days and early love, when you so coldly endeavored to destroy the happy hopes of your orphan niece? From one bad act how many evils come! Had you assisted that ruined-man--" "Assisted the man who had so ill-used me?" answered Pringle, " and broken the heart of her I loved better than life?" " Aye," replied the Spirit. "Had you remembered the lessons learnt at your mother 's knee, the precepts she taught you from the holy book--'to return good for evil'--how different would you be now! What is the agony of refec- ti'on! Not the recollection of your trials-they are past, and it is but a sigh they cost you for what you suffered then; but the knowledge of having done wrong, the burden of an uneasy conscience-it is this which is too much to bear -it is this which' causes men to drown thought, to endeavor to erase the painful memory of the past. But it will come; some chord is touched which restores it with the freshness    jterg  ritmat .     205 of yesterday; and then what' would they give for the years which I have borne away-away, never to come again? How differently would they act, then; and so are' you thinking now. Vain is such thought. Employ me well while I remain with you; redeem, in some measure, the errors of the past, and peace will yet come to you, for she is gentle and forgiving." With bowed head, Pringle had listened to the Spirit's words. At their conclusion the church clock loudly pro- claimed the hour. Pringle raised his head. Time had flown--and a hand is gently laid upon his shoulder, and a sweet voice says-- "Uncle, will you not come into the other room now; they are all gone but Fra-Mr. Wentworth; you have been asleep, have you not?" "Asleep! Yes; a long sleep; yes, I have; but I must wake up now, before I sleep for ever. Send Mr. Went- worth here, my dear; or rather bring him here; come with him." "Yes, uncle," replied the wondering Mary, as she went to do her uncle's bidding. She soon returned, followed by Frank. "My good young man, you love my niece, I believe?" "Most truly, Mr. Pringle, I love her." "That'll do; sir; there was no occasion to interrupt me." The watch ticked very loudly, and Pringle continued in a much milder tone.     - "' You love my niece. I hear you are a good, steady, excellent person, well fitted to take care of her, and have sufficient means, with a little of my assistance, to keep her. What would you do if I did not consent to your marriage? Marry -without, I suppose?" "No, indeed, sir, not at present," said Frank, smiling. "When I can afford to keep dear Mary without any one's   &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7943-00000103"/> 206        ffistomas *itofit assistance, then, perhaps, we should not wait for consent. Eh! Mary?"  Mary twisted her -apron-strings into a variety of extraordinary knots, and said nothing. Frank's cool and unexpected answer was a trial of Pringle's temper he could scarcely bear, and an angry reply was rising to his lips, but the loud ticking of the watch again checked him, and he continued: ' But supposing, sir, I took Mary away from you, and not only refused my consent, but prevented you from marrying her, what would you do then? Marry some- body else, I suppose?" There was no smile on Frank's face now, as he answered: "Never, sir! I can wait-aye, for years--for her, and live upon the hope that she may be mine, but never wed another." "No, never," said Pringle ; " and when you have waited, and find it hopeless, when she is dead of a broken heart, you will turn your thoughts to gaining wealth. Riches will drive love from your mind. You will toil, and toil, and money -vill come, and the more you have, the more you will want, and you will say, ' When I am old I will enjoy it. I am glad I did not marry. It's all for myself now.' And you will get old, and you will spend your hard-gotten wealth in striving for comfort; but it will not come; and as you sit by your lone fireside, the thoughts of her you love will haunt you, and you will wish, with all the agony of hopelessness, that she were by your side, and curse the man that parted y u as I have done-as I have done." "No, no, sir! uch -will not be the case. I trust my little Mary is too strong-minded to break her heart, if we are to be parted;" and his voice trembled slightly--" we shall both, I hope, keep up a cheerful spirit under the trial, for the performance of our duty here will give us the happiness of knowing that we shall meet at last where no one can   2g 07 part us." He stopped suddenly, for a low sob struck on his ear, and seizing Mary's hand in both of his, he said, in a low and earnest voice, "H Hush ; hush, my own darling, this is the only thing I cannot bear." There was a long pause, only disturbed by the ticking of the watch. At length Pringle rose, and laid his hand upon theirs. They started, and Mary grasped Frank's more firmly. "Ah! Mary, you may well doubt me; but you shall do so no longe,. I would not part you, believe me; no, no. I will die with the knowledge of having made some one happy, if I can. Take her, Frank Wentworth, she is yours." In an instant, Mary's arms were round his neck. She could not speak her thanks; but the warm tears which bedewed his face were more eloquent. And how his old withered heart bounded and beat, aye, keeping time with the watch, too, as Frank poured forth his thanks, and wrung him warmly by the hand. How his eyes glistened, as they had not done for many a year, as they both spoke of how they would cheer and comfort him, till at length Pringle besought them to say no more, but go and acquaint Mr. Austin, and let him go quietly to bed.- And so they did, and to bed Pringle went, and the watch was placed beneath his pillow, and the ticking, instead of worrying him as it used, sounded delightful to him now; it was so strange, too, it seemed constantly saying, "Peace-peace-peace;" then it faded to a gentle, indistinct murmur; then, like fairy voices singing, gradually died aWay,-and Pringle was asleep. A few years passed away, and Pringle fell ill, and daily and hourly by:his side sat gentle Mary Wentworth, till, with his hand fast locked in hers, he died. With his last breath, he gave her his watch, and told her it had been the cause of his consent to her marriage. Why,  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7943-00000104"/> 208        atrfismas iftoriet. of course, she never knew; but, rely on it, the watch was ever cherished as a sacred thing. He left a pension to Martha; but she said it was no use; no one understood her now; and so she died, and was buried by her master. Among his papers, in a diary, was this entry: "Given my consent to Mary's marriage. I know now what people mean by ({ A MERRY CHRISTMAS,) A.           o   .   The Waits; a Christmas Story. HHE cold Christmas moon was shining on the sleeping village of Cheriton. It lit up the long, straggling street, and made every object almost as distinctly visible as at noon-day. But in the spiritual light they ap- peared very different. A beautiful quietude, solemn yet serene, seemed to rest on all things. The quaint houses, with their high roofs and oddly-clustered chimneys, looked as if they brooded over the recollection of the long past times they had known; and the grand old church looked doubly reverend, with the frost-work glittering about its Norman-arched windows, and on the boughs of the huge cedar which towered beside the doorway. The moonbeams lingered lovingly about the grey walls; they fell, too, on the white gravestones in the churchyard, and made each one shine as with a still, calm smile-happy and holy. It was a night upon which thoughtful men might gaze, and feel rising in their hearts simultaneous hope for earth and aspiration to heaven. Very quiet was the place, as the moon went on her way, looking down with her clear, chill lustre of gaze. And        &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7943-00000105"/> 210         Cimtmw  ltories. there was one house, isolated from the others by a some. what extensive domain of shrubbery and garden, about which the moonlight seemed to play as -if in curiosity. It was a primitive, old-fashioned abode; window-shutters and blinds were few, save to the lower rooms, and the moon- beams penetrated unhindered into the chambers, and play- ed fantastic tricks upon the walls and floors. Into one little room the elfish rays darted on a sudden, as the moon, rising higher in the heavens, escaped the shadow of a pro- jecting buttress in the wall; and the pale light fell full upon a little white draped bed, wherein lay two young boys. One, the eldest by some years, was asleep, and the quivering light fell on his face-a face every lineament of which was so full of nervous energy, that even in sleep it did not wear an expression of repose. His brother's -pale, delicate features were, on the contrary, distinguished by a sort of sculptural calm. He had a high, straight, tho0ght- ful brow, and that sensitive mouth, which to the most mas- culine face always adds an almost womanlike sweetness of expression. The two boys seemed apt illustrations of two different- ly-constituted beings. The one all action, the other all thought; if the life of the first might be a picture, that of the second would be a poem, The younger brother was awake. His eyes of dark, deep, liquid hazel were thoughtfully fixed upon the sleeping face beside him, and:!now and again, as with a tender im- pulse, his hands gently put aside the clustering brown curls from the broad forehead of the sleeper. \ Presently he drew back the white curtain, and looked out at the quiet, homely scene stretched out in the moonlight--at the foreground of trees, leafless, but clothed in a fairy robe of rime, and (in the far distance, strangely clear that night) the wide wonder of the silent sea. He looked-his face lit up-glow- *-   S^Wtraes; a Crifmas ctrg. S2" ed with a nameless rapture. Unuttered prayers swelled in the young heart-instinctive hopes-blessed beliefs rose unbidden to his mind. And even while he thus gazed, and felt, and pondered. in the stillness of that wintry midnight, the stillness was broken. Vibrating on the frosty air came solemn strains of music, played with untaught skill on two or three old- fashioned instruments. It was an ancient English air, with a kind of patriarchal simplicity in its character, half carol, half hymn, which harmonized well with the place and the time. As the very voice of the quaint and peaceful village came the clear, sweet sounds, blending like a visible actuality with the wintry stars dotting the dark sky, with the snow- covered roofs, and walls, and trees, and with the pure, passionless moonlight shining over them all. "Laurence, wake!  Listen to the Waits!" It was some time before the subdued voice and the gentle touch disturbed the sleeper from his dreams. When at last he was aroused, he started up suddenly, crying aloud- "Who calls? Oh, Wilie, is it you?' he added, in a sleepy tone. "What do you wake me for? 'Tisn't morn- ing!' "Hush! speak low! Don't you hear the music?" There was a pause. The two boys listened in silence. "It's old Giles Headforthb with his violoncello,"' at length broke in Laurence, " and John Read, with his cracked haut-- boy, and little , "Ah, don't-!" cried the younger boy, with a gesture almost of pain; "never mind who plays. It sounds so solemn now, so, 7        , His words died away in the intentness of his listening. "Queer old tune, isn't it?" presently said Laurence, "and queer old figures they look, I'll be bound, standings  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7943-00000106"/> 212        %tnmaa tiorif. in the street, with red noses,and frozen eye-lashes, and muf- fled in- worsted comforters up to the chin." He laughed, and then yawned. ' I think I shall go to sleep again. These fellows don't seem inclined to leave off. I shall be tired of listening be- fore they are of playing, I expect." '",Keep awake a little longer, Laurence dear," pleaded the other. "It's only for one night, and 'tis so nice for us to hear the music, and look out upon the moonlight toge- ther." "Very well, Willie," assented the elder boy, nipping a fresh yawn in the bud, "' anything to please you, old fellow." "There--put your arm round me--so," pursued Willie, always in the same hushed, whispering tone, " and let me lean my head upon your shoulder. Now, that is pleasant. We love each other; don't we, Laurence?" And the tender, childish face looked upwards, askingly. "I should think so-slightly! You're a dear old chap, Will, though you have rather odd, old-fashioned notions." He stooped down, and pressed a hearty kiss on his young brother's delicate face. And then the two boys remained silent, watching the flickering moon-rays, and listening to the simple music without. There are some recollections, oftentimes trivial enough in themselves, which yet remain impressed upon the mind through a whole life, outlasting the memory of events far more striking, and more recent in their occurrence. Laurence and William Cart grew to be men, went out into the world, and wegre battlers for fortune; and one of them, alas! in fighting that hard fight became hardened in nature, so that scarce a trait remained of the generous, loving boy of yore. His soul was chilled in the stony rou-   qKe Waits; a 4tetmas storg.     213 tine of that life which is so scrupulously practical--one might almost say, material--the life of a London merchant, devoted heart and soul to his calling, and to the ambitions of his class. His old instincts were almost dead within him; his old aspirations, his boyish predilections, were crushed out, effaced, as though they had never been. And yet the cold, hard, money-getting man of the world never lost the vivid remembrance of that Christmas night, years and years ago, when his little brother lay with his head leaning on his shoulder, and they listened together to the village waits. The brothers were separated now--worse, they were estranged. The world came between them, and stifled the frank, free love which each, though in so widely different a way, had felt for the other, ever since the childish days when they had played together about the old house at Chbriton, and prayed, night and morning, at their mother's knee. The. two boys were left orphans before William was twenty years old, and with but little with which to begin life. Laurence's desires had been all for a life of change, adventure, and travel; but instead, he was compelled to take the only opening which offered to him; and,- before his father's death, was established in the counting-house of a wealthy relative.  He soon learned contentment with his fate. To pursue an object, be it fame, .or power, or wealth, seems an inherent instinct in man's nature. It fills his energies, satisfies his restlessness, and insensibly, but gratefully, ministers to that vague yearning for do- minion which is the inevitable birthright of every man since the beginning of the world. Laurence, shut out from worthier aspirations, found his ambition run high--to be great in the sense by which all those around him under- stood greatness. He would be rich. He would work his  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7943-00000107"/> 214        IAras itories  way to fortune, to position, to influence. Keeping that goal ever in view, he would struggle through every diffi- culty, force his way over every obstacle, but he would gain it at last. So he said to himself, silently, many times, dur- ing the weary time of probation, when obscurity and hard work appeared to be his allotted portion then and always. But this dark period did not last long; it was not likely that-it should continue. He had talents, quickness, vigor, untiring perseverance, and unfailing health. His progress was rapid. He climbed the hill with footsteps swift as they were sure, and when his father died the old man felt easy on the score of his eldest son's prospects and ultimate success. But meanwhile William had remained at home, pursuing his self-imposed and dearly-loved studies; reading, think- ing, dreaming his hours away in perfect happiness. From this content he was rudely aroused to the dread realities of death and poverty. The pleasant home and the familiar faces which made it so dear, seemed to slide from him,: and left him standing alone in the bleak world, which was so new and strange; like one who, reared in an Arcadia, is on a sudden thrust into the midst of the fierce turmoil of a battle. He sought his brother-but the two natures, always dif- ferent, were doubly Wso6(,s  when a life of active business had hardened teone, rendering it more than ever stern and uncompromising; while years of quiet retirement had made the other yet more refined, more visionary, more sen- sitive. And from Laurence, the younger brother met with no sympathy in all those innermost feelings of his soul; the closest, dearest portion of himself. There was in William Carr that inexplicable, intangible somewhat, which marks one man among his fellows-the Poet-even though he be dumb to his life's end,   4iIC tait/; a dl1ristmas /org.   215 Tile man of business shrugged his shoulders, knitted his brows at "William's strange fancies." He did not compre- hend-he did not care to do so, it seemed. The first step towards their estrangement was taken when William de- clined, gently and thankfully, but decisively, a situation in the same house where Laurence was now high in trust. "It is of no use, brother; it would hot be right to accept it. I am not fit for such a responsibility. It would be a wrong to my employers to burden them with my in- capacity." "You will improve. You may leave them to protect their own interests, believe me." William shook his head. And in brief; the elder brother found the delicate-look- ing youth immutable in his decision, and left him, with words of impatience and anger on his lips. His heart reproached him for it afterwards. He was not all encrusted as yet with the ossification of worldliness. The next day he again went to his brother's lodgings. But William was no longer there-he had left London, they told him; and it was not till he reached his own home that he received a letter of explanation:- "DAR LAUpmENCE,-I thought it best to go. Forgive me if you think it wrong. I am not able to struggle with the fierce multitude of money-getters in' this dreary Lon- don.. lMy old master, Dr. K i , has offered me a situation as classical tutor in his school. I have accepted it. It is the best thing I see to do. So farewell. "Ever yours, 4            WT".TTAM." "And my brother will be the paltry usher in a country school!" muttered Laurence, as he crushed the letter in his  &#xD;<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC7943-00000108"/> 216        i;Nlmas iihon.  -  i hand. "Gone, too, without consulting me, his elder, his natural adviser. It is badly done." And so the cloud between the brothers grew dark and palpable. They occasionally corresponded; but each suc- ceeding letter, instead of drawing them nearer together, seemed only to widen the gap. They did not understand one another. Besides, Laurence was becoming a rich man, had become partner in the house where once he was a clerk; while William still remained poor and obscure, with no prospect of his circumstances improving. And when the breach between two brothers or friends once exists, differ- ence of worldly position fatally, icily increases it. Laurence married brilliantly, choosing his wife from a noble but impoverished family, who were glad enough to ally their aristocratic poverty with his wealth, merchant and plebeian though he was. It was while on his wedding tour, with his handsome but somewhat passee bride, that he re- ceived a letter from his brother, forwarded to him from London. "From William-my brother," he remarked explana- torily, as he opened it; " in answer, I presume, to the an- nouncement of my marriage." The frigidly high-bred lady responded by a slight bend of her long neck, and busied herself with her chocolate and muffins, while her husband perused the letter. When he had finished, he refolded it carefully, and placed it in his pocket, then turned in silence to his breakfast. His wife never noticed any peculiarity in his manner; she was one of those by whom it is seldom considered good ton to be observant of other people's emotions, even a husband's. Lady Henrietta Carr was scrupulous in her attention to such points of etiquette. One more loving than she was, might possibly have divined how much was concealed under the pale face, the bent brow, and the remarkably quiet   e   t Baitsa; a (fristma iore 217 voice of Laurence Carr that morning.  One more tender, might even have drawn the secret disturbance forth, and pleaded the cause of the absent offender, instead of leav- ing the wrath to ferment hiddenly in the stern man's breast. "I will never forgive him-never, never! i I will never look on his face again. I will never give him help-we are strangers from this hour. Let him travel his own road- and starve r"' These hard, terrible words the brother passionately ut- tered, as he trod the room to and fro, when he was alone, and after again reading the letter.  i  "DEAR BROrHEKR LAURENCE" (it ran)--"  Your letter, with its brief announcement of your marriage, gave me great pleasure, not only for the sake of its intelligence, but because of the kindly manner in which you conveyed it to me. Perhaps, brother, it is an equal' reproach to both of us, that the cordiality was strange as. well as pleasant. Let lis be friends again, in heart as in name ; wre were so once- but it is a long while ago. In our new happiness we may surely drown all past 'offences. For I also am married- not to a peer's daughter; no, Laurence, with you alone will rest all the brilliances and grandeur of life; I only ask for a little quiet--I am easily content. My wife you may - remember; we all knew her when we were boys at school-- Mary Elliot, who, though her father was a village trades- man, has had the education, and innately possesses the. re- finement of any lady in the land. I have loved her, and she me, for six years. She is an orphan, too, and has been a governess all that time. We are rich enough to com- mence housekeeping, though on a modest scale. We are very happy; I pray that you may be the same with my new sister, to whom I beg to offer my affectionate regards. 10  &#xD;<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC7943-00000109"/> 218        ci;rstm8s grmie. Mary also joins me in the same to yourself; my dear bro- ther. And believe me ever yours faithfully, "WTTTAM CARRK." "The daughter of a country shopkeeper and the daughter of the Earl of Tynford to call each other sisters? And he has done this! He will repent it; he must, he shall. He is a disgrace, a shame to me. He might have been an aid-he might have helped my plans. But now-to marry thus i" Such were some of Laurence's disjointed exclamations, as he tore the letter in pieces, and -flung them into the fire. Then he joined his bride. In the course of the day'he informed her that his brother had irremediably offended him, and that he would never speak to him or see him -more. Lady Henrietta elevated her handsome eyebrows in a momentary amazement, then restored her features to their habitual expressionless composure, and, without any remark, suffered her husband to turn the conversation. *   e *     $   e   8   * Time passed on. The wealth of Laurence Carr in- creased yearly; his name grew glorious in the ears of business men. His house was a palace; his wife was jewel- led like a queen. He himself still burrowed daily in dusty city holes, whence all his riches seemed to spring; and every year he became harder and more impassible, and more devoted to the one aim and end of his life-money-get- ting. It was his sole ambition now-he had no hope, no joy in -'anything beyond. There was no happiness in his gor- geous home, no tenderness in his majestic and aristocratic wife. No one who looked on him would have imagined that he felt the want of love; that there was any remnant   QXse $Ntei; a fnristmas i^torg.   219 of the generous, warm-hearted boy's nature still lingering in the old grim merchant-old ibefore his time, but hard, and cold, and piercing as a steel poniard yet. But it was so. There were moments when his thoughts wandered at their own will--when he remembered. The face of his mother shone on him sometimes; and then would come a flash of memory-of the old childish days. And ah, so strange! the childish feelings of those days. And his two children. The boy he often pictured to himself as born to continue the greatness of his family--as enjoying, like a prince, the wealth and luxury he had labored to acquire. And the fair, gentle girl, whose pro- gress to womanhood he had followed in his thoughts; whose birth softened his harsh heart to absolute tender- ness. She it was who would cling to him lovingly in after years-whose soft lips would press upon the wrinkles of his worn face-whose gentle voice would always have the power to win him out of his harder, sterner self. If either of his children had lived, Laurence Carr might have been a different man; but both these blessings which he had prayed for-dreamed of as the solace and delight of his old age, were only granted to him for a brief space, and then- left his sight for ever. The blow rent his heart sorely. It was so-deep a grief, even, that at first he forgot the check to his ambition it involved.  No son of his would carry his name into future ages--no descendants of his were destined to make illustri- ous the plebeian family he had first raised from obscurity. When this remembrance came, it added to his affliction a something that was cold, stony, and almost defiant. Be- reaved love mourns, but blighted ambition erects its head in very impotence of pride against the hand that chastises. Laurence's heart grew hardened. He buried himself anew in his grim pursuits; they seemed the be-all and end-all of  &#xD;<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC7943-00000110"/> 220 -.       ronrfmaH btoaes. his existence now. He said to himself that it was enough; he would make it enough. Yet, spite of all his inward protestations, he looked en- viously, and sometimes with a feeling less selfish than envy, at the happy parents of blooming children. He would have given well nigh all his hard-won wealth for one such boon as was so freely granted to many. Against his will he often found himself musing thus, sorrowfully, yearningly. He would awake himself with stern resolve; the one half of his nature would shrink into itself, while the other looked on it witha sardonic kind of pity. Yet again and again came these softening reveries. It was in the midst of one of them, in'the twilight of a dreary December evening, that he was roused by receiving a letter from William, It was the first since many years, during which the stern elder brother had suspended all intercourse, and had never sought to know what had become of the other. He had known somewhat, however; for William had come to London and had commenced the new life of authorship, and Laurence had occasionally met his name in passing periodicals. But direct communication between the two had altogether ceased. He frowned as he recognised the hand. Perhlaps, had this letter come at any other time, he might have returned it unopened.  Oh, men! ye who pray, pray for your fellow-men whose hearts are hardened. Oh, angels! plead for them, strive for them; for verily if there be a place in-all His works where God does not dwell, and where no saving spark of divinity can linger, it must be in the sterile heart of a world-hardened man. Laurence frowned; but he tore the letter open so soon as the servant had left the room, and he read:-   G %itCad; u  Ellrmatmav rr tegr - 221 "I had almost sworn never to address you again, after that last letter you sent. In that you bade me never to trouble you more; you told me that you would neither lis- ten to me nor assist me, however sore my strait might be. I forgot you were my brother when I read those words; the devil rose within me, and I had uttered--what here- after it might have withered me to think of, only my wife came up to me, and looked in my face, and, God bless her, while her eyes rested on me, I could not speak, nor even think of what was hissing at my heart. I tell you this that you may judge what it costs me to write to you now. ' I might starve,' you said. Laurence Carr, since then I have learned what starvation is like-I have travelled very near its utmost brink; it is a word the meaning of which I knoto. That would not drag me one quarter inch towards your threshold; its worst agony is not within a twentieth part of that which even the thought of addressing you for help would have -cost me. But that anguish now is swal- lowed in a greater.. I ask your help-I entreat you, I be- seech you to assist me. Laurence, we are brothers, the children of one mother; do not deny me. Give to me as you would to a beggar-fling me some money into the street. I care not how, so you be not deaf to my cry- only be prompt, for Death is pitiless. "Brother! God look on you as you hearken to me. ffly child is dying for want of food. I wait. "WILLIAM CARRY. Laurence rose from his gilded chair, and traversed the luxurious chamber wherein he had sate, stately and solitary. He opened the door-there he paused. Then, as if with new resolution, he stepped forth into the hall. In a remote corner, which even the brilliant lamp failed -to clearly illumine, lie distinguished a tall, thin figure--a  &#xD;<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC7943-00000111"/> 222        ;tritmais tiits. pale, pinched face, with grey hair falling tangled over the broad brow. Did Laurence see then, the vision of the bright-haired child, who slept on his breast one Christmas night long years back? Who can tell! Howheit, he retreated into the room before he' was recognised, or even seen by his brother; and it was by a servant that he sent to William a small but heavy packet. He eagerly seized it, with a kind of smothered cry, almost like a sob, and the next instant had left his brother's house. The child was saved; and then William had time to think on the sacrifice he had made to save it. His proud heart was torn at the remembrance that he had been a waiting petitioner in the hall of his brother's house, and had been relieved at the hands of his brother's lackey. He could not know that Laurence, hard man as he was, had, tried to face him, but could not; that he had watched him as he darted away through the street; that he had thought of him often, since, with something almost approaching tenderness. He did not know this; so he strove and toiled with desperate energy, till he could give back his brother's gold, and then returned it with a brief acknowledgment. He added-"It is best for us both to forget our humiliation, for you degraded both in me. Let us be strangers again." The returned money found Laurence Carr a ruined man. Sudden political troubles abroad, with their inevita- ble consequences-Ltwo or three mistakes in home commer- cial policy-had brought about this great change, and he was bankrupt. A day-two or three hours in that day- saw the fall, saw the ruin to its climax. The merchant prince was worse than pennyless; for there were large debts which all his vast possessions, all his accumulated wealth, would fail to satisfy. His wife, naturally incensed   Zte  Baste; a ^ristmta Stog9'.  223 at his misfortunes, betook herself and her liberal jointure to the parental roof, and he remained alone to combat with ruin. Then came out the finer part of his character. With courage he encountered the host of difficulties that pressed crushingly upon him. With scrupulous (some people called it Quixotic) integrity he gave up all he had, and quietly and simply announced his intention of paying off the resi- due of his debt to the uttermost farthing, if he lived. Then with proud, silent bravery, he accepted a clerkship in some brother-merchant's office, took a humble lodging, and began again the life he had commenced in his early youth. The world-even the world of business and money- getting-is not so wholly bad as we read of in novels. Laurence received many offers of assistance, and one or two good hearts persisted for a long time in following him with their active friendship. But he was not -great enough to feel gratitude, or even to thoroughly appreciate their goodness. His pride was but the pride of a strong,.bold, determined man. He disdained sympathy, and sullenly re- pulsed all proffered generosity. The wheel of fortune had made a complete revolution. While depressing one brother, she elevated the other. William was growing into that rara avis, a flourishing au- thor. He was sufficiently far from being wealthy, certainly; he was at an equally safe distance from want. And now- Oh, beware! ye who hastily write resentment-he felt as though he would gladly return to his old poverty, if he could only recall the few lines he had sent awhile since to his now ruined brother. It -was long before he dared to approach him with at- tempts at ieconciliation. B- e felt keenly, with anguish, the fresh bitterness he had himself added to the former estrange- ment. If desperate then, it was surely hopeless now. Yet  &#xD;<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC7943-00000112"/> 224 '       llritftmas $iorte. he tried. He wrote again and again, and his letters were returned with their. seals unbroken. He laid in wait often, and essayed to speak to him-to grasp his -hand. He was coldly thrust aside, without a word, without a look. He was always denied admittance at the door, when time after time he sought the poor abode where the former million- naire had his shelter. One less tender, less patient than William, had been effectually repulsed with half the rebuffs he met with. But his exceeding love and yearning over his brother, besides the consciousness of having outraged that brother's pride, now that he was fallen from his high estate, smote him with an intense, sharp remorse. Only a man can wholly sympa- thize in a man's pride. William's own heart, different as it was, told him how great was the barrier he had set between them. At length William and his wife bethought themselves of another plan. Their child, the girl that Laurence's assistance had saved from death, was now grown into a fair damsel, of some fourteen years. She was like her father, with golden hair and brown eyes, such as he had. "He   cannot turn her from him, said the father and mother, as with glistening eyes they watched her on her way. She led her little brother by the hand, and these two presented themselves before Laurence, as he sat reading il the quiet sunshine of a Sabbath afternoon. "We   are Willie and Alice," said the girl, timidly, look- ing in his face. He knew them at once, though his eyes had never rested on them before. Alice was his mother's name, and his mother's face seemed bent on him now, longingly, yearn- ingly. William and his wife were right-'he could not turn her from him.   Ie mta: a d   m itris ito rg.  225 ( Uncle, won't you look at us?" said the pleading voice again; " won't you speak to us-me and little Willie?" "Papa's own little Willie," chimed in the boy inoppor- tunely. "Go home to your father," said Laurence in a harsh, constrained voice; "I have nothing to say to you. Go home.  I do not wish," he added in a softer tone, 1" to be unkind to you, but-but-you must leave me." The giil stood drooping and tearful; the little boy gazed at him with wondering eyes. He was fain to escape from them, and so passed from the room. After that William grew hopeless. He had exhausted his stock of expedients: all his patience, endurance, seemed in vain. He despaired of ever softening his obdurate heart. Time passed on, and Laurence was untroubled by his brother. His persevering industry was working its own way, too, and he was already clear of the barren poverty he had at first experienced after his ruin. Each succeeding year found him advancing to ease again, if not to affluence; and he was stern, cold, and unbending as ever. Another Christmas-tide drew near-forty-five years after that Christmas when the moon shone on the little white bed at Cheriton. It was Christmas-Eve, and Laurence had been detained late in the city, balancing some complex accounts. It was past midnight as he wended his way homewards. It was a frosty night, and moonlight, and the suburban streets were quiet and -slumberous; Laurence's footsteps, echoing on the pavement, alone breaking the stillness. Somehow, without his own will, almost in spite of it, indeed, his thoughts turned back to old times, and there arose before him a vision of the quaint house in the country, where his boyhood had been passed; the large rambling garden, the big mul- berry trees, and the wood near the village where he and Wilhe had used to gather nuts. He and Willie!-there he 10*  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7943-00000113"/> 226       fristma itor. frowned and sternly refused to dwell on the retrospection. He walked quickly on, with lips sturdily compressed and brows knitted, resolved to shut his mind on all softening influences; but he could not-the thoughts came rgain, and would not be repulsed. He lifted his eyes to the sky, and the myriad stars were shining down on him with a kind of smile-the same smile as that of long ago . .... He could not sleep that night. He lay very quiet, but with a world of busy thoughts fluttering about his heart, striving for entrance. The moonlight streamed in through a crack in the blind, and lit up the dreary, comfortless room. Laurence closed his eyes suddenly. The moonbeams brought a remembrance with them that he would not welcome. There came a sound of music outside in the frosty street. The Waits! And they played the old, old tune two boys had listened to years ago at Cheriton. Very strangely it sounded on Laurence's ears-strangest of all because it seemed so familiar. With a mysterious, irresistible power-the sweet, solemn strain smote on his closed heart, and even before he recognised it he had yielded to its power, and, wondering the while, felt the hot tears bubbling thickly to his eyes. And then came thronging the recollections of the olden days-vanished the intervening years, like an obscuring smoke, leaving clear and vivid the memory of the happy, innocent time, when he was a boy, and Wilhe was his dear brother. The pleasant home, the kind father, and-gentlest thought of all-the mother who had been wont every night to hang over her boys in their little white bed, and linger- ingly kiss them ere they went to sleep. How plainly he remembered all-the childish face with its golden curls; he opened his eyes, almost expecting to see it on the pillow beside him. No! the moonlight only fell on his own thin,   BGEa Watv-; a /94riftills *form.  227 wrinkled hand, worn and shrivelled with the troubles and the cares of well-nigh sixty years. Prayerful thoughts, long strange to him, alas! came in- stinctively to his mind, and he heard, low and soft, but clear, and blending with the music in the street, the voice of his mother, sounding as of old when she read to her little sons from the large Book on her knee. He heard solemn, slow, and sweet, the Divine -words-"And this commandment Ileave with you, that ye love one another." He saw the dear mothers eyes as they rested on her boys with such an infinite yearning tenderness in their depths. He could tell now, what that earnest look meant. He could guess, too, something of what were her thoughts, when often in their childish quarrels she would draw littJl Willie close to her side, and then pass her arm round the strong, active, vigorous Laurence, whispering, "Don't be harsh with Willie; take care of Willie. Love each other always, my boys-my darlings." The "waits ceased-the air was silent-but there was music still in the heart of Laurence Carr. Christmas Day at Cheriton was drawing to its close. The evening bells were ringing-the stars shone in the dark colorless sky. The murmur of the waves beating vn the shore came ever and anon-a quiet sound and happy. Only two days before William Carr had come to live at Cheriton in the old house. It was nothing altered; there were the same many-paned windows, quaint .corners, and gabled ends; the same surrounding domain of garden, with the grove of trees beyond, behind which the icy moon was rising even now. At the bay-window of the oak-panelled parlor sat Wil- liam and his wife, with their two- children, watching the pale light trembling between the branches of the gloomy  &#xD;<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7943-00000114"/> 228        jfritmas tonrks firs. The- firelight flashed and glowed within the room, lighting up the pictures on the walls, the books, and prints, and drawings scattered on the table, and the graceful groups of winter flowers lavishy disposed, as women love to have them-everywhere. Alice rested beside her father-his hand wandered among her bright curls; but he was look- ing towards the fir grove, and his thoughts had -travelled back, many, many years. His wife's eyes were fixed on his face; she could read the language of that sad wistful look; she knew how eloquently everything he saw spoke to his heart of the old happy childish days-tender, pathetic memories that she also loved so dearly for his sake. The children prattled gaily for some time, but at length, their voices ceased; they were subdued into stillness by -the unwonted gravity of their father. Never had they seen him so sorrowful, and they marvelled in their innocent hearts; for he was happy, they knew, at coming back to Cheriton- to his old home. All the afternoon he had been pointing out to them his favorite haunts-his garden, his tree with the seat under it, and the little room where he used to sleep. He had been so smiling and glad then. What could make Papa look grieved now? Awed by the mystery, they gave their good-night kiss with added tenderness, but silently; and silently followed their mother from the room. But she returned almost im- mediately, and stole softly behind the chair wherein her husband sat, still looking forth with that silent, longing, re- gretful look. Even when he felt her arm round his neck he did not turn. But she spoke softly- "Dearest, I know. But be comforted. It will be made right some day, Perhaps before another Christmas. God has been so good to us, he will not deny this one blessing you so crave, so pray for. " And William folded her to his heart, and smiled. Mary's   it;te  ; ,a frtnms iorg.     229 voice never sounded in his ears but to create peace, or to add to content. When she left him again, the moonlight fell on his face, and showed it calm, hopeful, and serene. There came a heavy tread on the stone steps, leading to the entrance door, and then the great bell rang startlingly through the quiet house. William rose, and himself went to meet the intruder.       Fairly, clearly, purely gleamed the moonlight in at the window; warm and generous glowed the fire, revealing the pleasant home-like aspect of the room. So William threw back his grey hair from his brows-a boyish habit, continued ever since the time of golden curls -and went to the outer door, unbarred and opened it. A gush of chill, sharp air-the sound of the sea, like a far-off chant-the moonbeams, white on the stone porch and pavement-and a dark figure standing motionless there; --this was what William felt, and heard, and saw, the first moment. The next, a face looked on him, a hand was stretched towards him, and a voice uttered only one word- "Brother!" William's joyful cry answered him; then, like Joseph of old, " he fell upon his neck, and wept." And at the door where the two children had so often entered from their play, the two grey-haired men stood, the Christmas stars shining on their faces.  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7943-00000115"/> Mrs. Peck's Pudding. ^44 ^HE disappointment will be dreadful," said Mrs. Peck, speaking to herself, and looking from the -   /  dingy floor,- up the bare wall, at the blank ceiling. "But how to get one, Heaven only knows!" It was the afternoon of the 24th of December. Christ- masDay was at hand, and for the first time in her existence Mrs. Peck was without a plum-pudding. For years past she had been reduced in life; but never so reduced as that! She was in despair. Not that she particularly doted on the composition; but it was a sort of superstition with her that, if she failed to taste the dish in question on that festi- val,- she should never again enjoy luck in this world, or per- haps in the next. It was a foolish notion: but many enlightened Christians cling religiously to similar opinions; for example, as to pancakes on Shrove Tuesday, or hot cross buns on a Good Friday. So with Mrs. Peck, a plum- pudding on Christmas Day was an article of her faith. Yes she must have one, though it should prove but a dumpling of larger growth. But how? Buying was out of the question; she had not half a farthing in the house-   L-ars. 1t'W l:bbing.     231 a widow without a mite!-and stealing was not to be thought of--she must borrow or beg. Once' arrived at this conclusion, she acted on it without delay. There were plenty of little emissaries at hand, in the shape of her own ,children, for the necessary errands-namely, Careful Susan, Dirty Polly, Greedy Charley, Whistling Dick, Little Jack, and Ragged Peter, so called from a fragment of linen that usually dangled behind him, like a ship's ensign from its stern. "Children!" said Mrs. Peck, "I am going to have a Christmas plum-pudding." At such an unexpected announcement, the children shouted, jumped about, and clapped their skinny hands. But their mirth was of brief duration. Second thoughts, for once none of the best, soon reminded them that the cup- board was as bare as Mother Hubbard' ; while the maternal pocket was quite empty. How the thing was to happen, therefore, they knew not-unless by some such fairy feat as sent black-puddings tumbling down the chimney; or some such scriptural miracle as showered quails and manna in the wilderness; or that one, which Greedy Charley remembered to have seen depicted in blue and white on -a Dutch tile, of horned cattle and sheep coming down from heaven to St. Peter, in a monster bundle. But having vainly watched the hearths, the walls, and the ceiling, for a minute or so, they gave up all such extravagant expectations. The hopes of Ragged Peter were, like his nether garment, in tatters; and the dingy face of Dirfy Polly looked darker than- ever. There was- a dead silence, at last broken by Little Jack. "But, mammy, you have got no plums." "And no' flour,"s said Careful Susan. ' And no suet," said Dirty Polly. "Nor no sugar," said Ragged Peter.  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7943-00000116"/> 232        6mridmas iainow. "And no almonds and orange peel," said Greedy Charley. "No eggs," said Careful Susan; "And never a saucepan," said Whistling Dick. "As to almonds and orange peel," said Mrs. Peck, "we must do without. Our pudding will be a very plain one. That is to say, if we get it at all, for there is not one ingre- dient in the house. We must borrow and beg: so get ready, all of you, to run on my errands." "-Let me go for the plums, mother," said Greedy Char- ley; but knowing his failing, she assigned to him to plead to Mr. Crop, the butcher, for a morsel of suet. Dirty Polly was to extract a few currants and raisins and some sugar, if she could, out of Mr. Perry, the grocer; Little Jack was to wheedle a trifle of flour from Mr. Stone the baker; and Careful Susan was to get three eggs of Mrs. Saukins, who did mangling in her parlor and kept fowls in her cellar. Whistling Dick undertook to borrow a sauce- pan*; and as Ragged Peter insisted also on a commission, he was sent to hunt about-the streets, and pick up a little orange-peel-candied, if possible. As the children had no promenade dresses to put on, they were soon ready. Susan merely reduced the angles of her bonnet front to something of a semicircle; and Dirty Polly, with a single tug, made her short scanty garment look a little more like a frock, and less like a kilt. She might, indeed, have washed her face, as Ragged Peter might have tucked in some dirty linen, with personal ad- vantage; but as they were not going to a juvenile party, they waived the ceremony. Little Jack clapped on his crownless hat; Greedy Charley took his jew's-harp, the gift of a generous charity boy; Whistling Dick set up his natural pipe; and away they went, in search of a pudding by instalments.   lr,- tck'S tabhing.      233 As soon as they were gone, hins. Peck, having made up the fire, washed her hands and arms very clean, and then seating herself at-the round deal table, with her elbows on the board, and her chin between her palms, began to calcu- late her chances of success. The flour, provided Mr. Stone, and not his wife, was in the shop, she made sure of. The fruit was certain-the suet was very possible-the eggs pro- bable-the saucepan as good as in her own hand-in short, being of a sanguine temperament, she dreamed till she saw before her a smoking hot plum-pudding, of respectable size, and dappled with dark spots, big and little, like a Dalma- tian dog. In the meantime, Charley, twanging all the way on his jew's-harp, arrived at the butcher's, who was standing before his shop with his back to the road, admiring, as only butch- ers can admire, the rows of fat carcases and prime joints on the tenter-hooks before him. Could that meat have known his sentiments concerning it, what proud flesh it would have been! Hearing a step behind him, and anticipating a cus- tomer, he turned round with his usual "What d'ye buy?" "I haven't got no money to buy with," said Charley, "or else"--and looking round for the desired object, he pointed to it with his finger-"I'd buy that ere lump of suet." '"And what do you want with suet?" asked the butcher. "If you please, sir," replied Charley, "it's for our pud- ding. But mother is out of money; so if you don't let me have that bit of suet, either on credit or for charity , "Well, what then?" said the butcher. "Why then," said Charley, " it will be the first time in our lives that we've gone without plum-pudding on this blessed festival." The butcher was a big, flolid man, bloated and reddened, as persons of his trade are said to be, by constantly imbib-  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7943-00000117"/> 234       C Trb*tml itriteAt ing invisible beef-tea and mutton broth, or, as it is called,.the smell of the meat. But, although thus appropriating by minute particles the flesh and fat of sheep, oxen, and pigs, he was far from becoming a brute. He cast a kindly glance at the poor boy, who looked sickly and ill-fed, and then a triumphant one at his halves and quarters, glorious with nature's red and -white, and gay with sprigs of holly, sug- gesting the opportune reflection that Christmas comes but once a year, 'c There-take it, boy-you're welcome to it, gratis, by way of a Christmas box-and my compliments of the season to your mother." So saying, he tossed the suet to Charley, who, forgetting in his joy to thank his benefactor, ran straight home with the treasure, as delighted as if he had just won the prize ox in a beef-union lottery. The success of Dirty Polly was less decisive. Before entering the grocer's shop, she took a longing look through the window, unconsciously nibbling at her own fingers, in- stead of those delicious Jordan almonds, and that crisp can- died citron and orange peel-and sucking in imagination at those beautiful Smyrna figs, and Damascus dates, and French plums, so temptingly displayed in round drums and fancy boxes, with fiills of tinted paper round each compartment. And there, too, were the very articles she wanted-new currants from Zante--rich Malaga raisins, or of the sun, or sultanas, with samples of sugar of every shade and quality, from a fine light sand to a coarse dark gravel; but, alas! all ticketed at impracticable rates, in obtrusive figures! The owner had: marked a price on everything except the long twisted sticks of sugar-candy and the canes of cinnamon that leaned against the China figure. "Will he give away any- thing for nothing," she asked herself, " if I beg ever so!" The China mandarin nodded his head, and she stepped in.   Air. Ittk' Vbbting.       235 The grocer himself was in the shop, in his snow-white apron, busily dusting, with a clean cloth, some imaginary impurities from the polished counter. He was not a harsh man, but a particular one, scrupulously neat in his apparel, and cleanly in his person. The slovenly frock and grubby flesh of Dirty Polly did not therefore prepossess him in her favor. He hastily took down a pair of dazzling bright scales and asked her what she wanted. But Polly was silent. She was haunted by those large black numerals, no figures of fun, but formidable to penniless poverty as giants with clubs. The grocer again inquired what she wanted. ( Why, then, if you please, sir, it's raisins, and currants, and brown sugar." "How much of each?" "As much, sir," replied Polly, dropping a low courtesy, "asr you'll please to give us." "Pshaw!" said the grocer. "It's for a Christmas pudding," said Polly, beginning to whimper: " and if you don't take pity on us, we shall have none at all." The grocer was silent, and turned away from  her towards his shelves and canisters. "Do, sir-pray do," said Polly, wringing her handls and beginning to cry, not much to the advantage of her looks, as the tears washed away the dirt in stripes; and still less when she wiped'her cheeks and eyes with the skirt of a frock that was draggled with mud. Luckily the grocer's back was still turned, so that he did not see the grimy drops which fell on his bright mahogany. "Pray, pray, pray-only a few plums and currants, and a little, a very little sugar," said Polly, between her sobs. "There", said the grocer, turning suddenly round, and thrusting a square paper of something into her hand. "Take that, and tell your mother to make good use of it."  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7943-00000118"/> 236        %B1ians itoris. In the eagerness of her joy, for the thing felt like a money-box, Dirty Polly hurried out of the shop, and sure, in the absence of sugar and plums, of the means of buying them, she ran home to her mother with the speed of a young heifer. The next subject for experiment was Or. Stone, the baker; but unfortunately Mr. Stone was from home, and his helpmate was at the desk in the shop, in charge of the pecks, quarterns, and half-quarterns, the fancy twists, and the French rolls. She was a little pale woman, with quick grey eyes, and a sharp-pointed nose, so sharp and pointed, that she might have. drilled with it the holes in the butter- biscuits. A glance at Little Jack and the receptacle he car- ried informed her at once of his errand. "Flour, eh? And in that odd thing!" "Yes, ma'am," said Little Jack. "When poor daddy was alive it was one of his double nightcaps; but mammy has turned it into a flour bag by cutting off one end." "A quartern, I suppose," said Mrs. Stone, going towards the large tin scale. "If you please, ma'am," said Jack, " and be as good as not to let it be seconds or middlins, but the best flour." "There then, child," said Mrs. Stone, holding out one hand with the full bag, and the other for the money. "There's no money, ma'am," said Little Jack. . Mam- my's not got any. The flour isn't to be paid for." "No, no; that won't do," said Mrs. Stone; "I'm not /;i going to book it." "We don't want you to," said Little Jack. "You-don't!" exclaimed Mrs. Stone. "No, ma'am," said Little Jack. "I'm begging, ma'am, it's for charity." "- In that case," said Mrs. Stone, deliberately returning the flour into the great tin scale, " charity begins at home."   Frs. 1eti's 3mbng.      237 So saying, she tossed the empty nightcap into the blank face of the urchin, who, beginning to cry, and having nothing else to wipe his eyes with, made use of the flour bag, which soon converted his woe into dough. "It's for our Christmas pud--pud--pudding," he blub- bered. "We only had a very tiny one last year, and now there won't be none at all." "A Christmas fiddlestick!" exclaimed Mrs. Stone. "Here, come hither, you little wretch, and I will give you something worth all the creature comforts in the world." "Is it good to eat?" asked Little Jack. "To eat!" cried Mrs. Stone, with upraised hands and, eyes. "Oh, belly gods! belly gods! belly gods!"-a sin- gular exclamation enough for a woman who sold fancy bread and took in bakings. "When will the poor leave off hankering after the flesh-pots of Egypt?" "I don't know," said Little Jack. "No; but your mother might!" retorted Mrs. Stone. "A quartern of flour indeed! When will she ask for the heavenly manna?" "Perhaps she will," said Jack, " arter she's finisheb6er pudding." "There again!" exclaimed Mrs. Stone, "nothing but gluttony. But come this way;"-and she led Little Jack into the parlor behind the shop, where she first unlocked her bureau, and then opened a private drawer. "There!" sh said, thrusting a paper parcel into his tiny hand-" ther spiritual food-go home, and tell your mother to feed well with it." Little Jack took the gift with the best bow he could make. To'be sure it was not flour, but the package might contain Embden grits, which was better than nothing, and he was found of gruel; so he made the best of his way  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC7943-00000119"/> 238        d  mmtid l1H. ima. home, not quite so well pleased as Greedy Charley or Dirty Polly, but better satisfied than Careful Susan. She had picked her way through the dirt to Mrs. Sau- kins's, before whose door a spangled bantam, with a magnifi- cent red comb and wattles, was strutting about, cocksure of possessing the handsomest feather-trousers in the whole parish; and responding at intervals with a screeching chuckle to a more distant cackle in the cellar. Accepting the hint of this bird of good omen, Susan at once ascended the steps, and walking into the mangling parlor, explained her wants to the proprietor.  "By all means," said Mrs. Saukins. "Three eggs-yes, certainly--I'll fetch 'em directly--warranted new-laid- hark! there's Polly Phemus." "Pollywho?" said Susan. ," Polly Phemus. I give female names to all my hens; and know every one by her voice., Yes, that's her-black with a white tuft--a Polish everlasting layer-she's in her nest, in the old candle-box up in the dark corner. Well- three eggs-I think you said three?-Yes, certainly-you shall have them warm, as I may say, from the hen." "Thankee, ma'am,"' said Susan. "Mother can't pay for thfem now, but she will out of her very first money." "Dear me!" exclaimed Mrs. Saukins. "That alters the case. I'm very sorry to deny--but eggs is eggs now, and the-new-laid uns fetches tuppence apiece. Besides it's not, the season, and my poultry don't lay." ," Kuk-kuk-kuk-a-larcock /" cried the hen in the cellar. t La'rcock!" echoed the spangled bantam. "No, they don't lay!" said the unblushing Mrs. Saukins. "And if they did, my fowls pay ready money for their bar- ley, and can't afford to give credit.'" "Then you won't let us have them?" said"Susan. "It's unpossible," said Mrs. Saukins. "My poultry has   xI  3xk'rr btttihng.     239 suffered such bad debts already. If they once knew I book- ed, they'd turn pale in the combs, and leave off laying directly. They've done it afore-yes-often and often. I'm very sorry, I'm sure--and if it was anything else-for example, a little mangling----, "You're very kind," said Susan, "but we've got no linen. So you won't oblige us with the eggs?" "Dear me, no--I said no," replied Mrs. Saukins. "My poultry is my partner, and would dissolve directly. Their terms for new-laid is tuppence apiece, cash down, or three for a sixpence. That's the lowest; but to a friend I'd ven- ture to go so far as to give one in-that one there, in the little moss basket in the window. To be sure the flies has spotted it a little, till it looks more like a thrush's, but it's a hen's-and as fresh a one as ever was brbke in a basin." "But I haven't got sixpence," said Susan. "The more's the pity," said Mrs. Saukins, " for my hens is imperative. My mangle sometimes accommodates with credit, but my poultry won't. Birds is so cunning, and my fowls in particular. I do really believe they would know a bad shilling from a good one." "But mother promises faithfully to pay," said Susan. "No, no," said Mrs. Saukins. "My poultry won't take promises.  They know  pence from piecrust-you might offer them a- bushel of promises, and promissory notes besides, without getting an egg out of them-but only show them the money, and they go off to their nests an lay like lambs."            '   c' There goes our pudding then!" said Susan, in a tone of deep dejection. "Do you mean a Christmas pudding-a plum one?" in- quired Mrs. Saukins. "I do," replied Susan. "It will be the first time that  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7943-00000120"/> 240        $ 8rttmlas iomri we have missed haying one, and mother will feel it dread- fully. It's quite a religious point with her." "Well, that's lucky!" exclaimed Mrs. Sanikins, " for if I can't oblige with the eggs for a pudding, I can favor with a receipt for making one-rich, yet economical." "I would rather have the eggs," thought Susan: but as the pudding promised to be anything but a rich one, and the recipe professed to be a cheap one, she thought it pru- dent to take advantage of the offer. Accordingly, the docu- ment having been transcribed, she put the copy in her pocket, and returned home; the least satisfied of all the foraging party with the result of her expedition. Ragged Peter, it is true, had failed equally in his search for orange peel. Whether some elderly lady or gentleman had stepped on a piece, at the cost of a compound fracture, and so had sharpened pro tempore the vigilance of the police, or whether it had become the fashion to eat the rind with the fruit, there was not a morsel of it to be picked up, candied or uncandied. But to ma#e amends for this disap- pointment, in passing along a street at the West End, the ragged boy had the good luck to be espied by a personage who had beforetime noticed him, on account of some fan- cied resemblance to a deceased nephew. Peters eyes twinkled with joy as he recognised his old acquaintance in his splendid livery; and the more from remembering that at their last meeting he had been presented with some of the requisites for a plum-pudding. He crossed the road, there- *re, with alacrity, in compliance with the friendly signal om the powdered gentleman at the open street-door. The porter was a very tall and very portly man, with a very convex chest, and a very stiff frill projecting from it, from top to bottom, like a palisade to keep off all intruders on his heart or bosom. Nor was there anything very promis- ing to poor boys in general in his lively, blue turned up M   Ott* etc's ^ ubbinn.      241 with red, and trimmed with gold lace, making him look merely a free translation of a parish beadle. Nevertheless the porter was a good-natured fellow; and his glance was genial, and his voice was kindly, as he accosted the ragged child. "Well, young un!-Where now!-Do you remember me?" "Yes, sir," said Peter, with a cheerful smile. "4 You give me once a pocketful of almonds and reasons." "Ah, that was after our dinner-party," said the porter. "I've none to-day." Peter sighed, and was turning away from the steps, a movement that exhibited the dilapidations in his rear, when he was recalled by the same friendly voice. Peter- stopped. "Stay here till I come back." And the gentle giant went inwards, whence he presently returned with a bundle, which he placed in Peter's arms. "There, take that-it's good stuff-and tell your mother to do her best with it." "We shall have a pudding, anyhow," thought Peter, not doubting that the bundle of good stuff had been made up by contributions from the cook and housekeeper; where- fore, spluttering some broken thanks to the porter, he ran home with his rags fluttering in the wind, as fast as he could scamper: The last of the adventurers was Whistling Dick. To the tune of " O where, andO0 where," he had successfuily/l visited the whole of his mother's friends and acquaintances- -no great number in all, as often happens to a widow with a limited income-but from nobody could he obtain a loan of the indispensable culinary utensil. One had lent her saucepan already; another had burnt a hole in it; a third had it on the fire with the family dinner; a fourth had pawned it, but his mother was welcome to take it out; and  &#xD;<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC7943-00000121"/> 242        }mra o i tmfe. a fifth, an Irishwoman, had never had any saucepan at all except the frying-pan. "I do believe," said Dick, "if there is such things as saucepans in kitchens, they have all asked for a holiday, like the servants, and gone out for a day's pleasure." At last he gave up the search in despair, and was walk- ing slowly homewards, when his attention was attracted by a tapping at a parlor window. He looked up, and recog- nised over the Venetian blind, the three faces of the young Masters Britton, who had once called him into the house to whistle to them. "Who knows,"- thought Dick, " if I am invited in again, but I may make friends with the cook, and so get the lend of a saucepan?5" But the hope was fallacious. He was indeed asked in; but the moment he mentioned the object of his expedition, and confessed his designs on the kitchen, the youngsters, one and all, declared that the thing was impossible. Their mamma was out, and the cook was such a termagant, and, that morning particularly, in so fierce a temper, that he might as well confront a fiery dragon. But what did he want with a saucepan? "To bile our puddin' in," said Dick. "It's Christmas time, you know; and we don't like to miss keepin' it."' At the mention of Christmas and keeping it, the young Brittons withdrew into a corner, and held a whispered con- su-ltation, which seemed a long one, before they broke up, and clustered again round their protge'. "Do you ever play at a round game?1" inquired Master John. "Sometimes," answered Dick. * "Only I harn't got a hoop.", The young Brittons looked in some perplexity at each other. ...   UnAt. @tth's 3rehinSg.     243 "You know what counters are, don't you?" asked Master William. "Yes," replied Dick; "they nail bad ha'pence to them., The young Brittons were again disconcerted by this answer. "He don't understand us," observed Master William. "Give it him at once," said Master Benjamin. Thus instructed, Master John advanced close up to Dick, and poked something into his hand, which the receiver thoroughly looked at, and then in turn at each of the young gentlemen. "It's to play with, said Master John. "You'll find it very amusing;" said Master William. "But you must whistle us a tune for it," said Master -Benjamin. Dick immediately complied, and struck up "Sich a get- tin' up stairs," but rather dolefully; he would have prefer- red a good-sized, well-tinned saucepan to the thing in his hand, or all the toys in the world. However, a trifle is better than nothing; so, thrusting it into his pocket, he took leave of the young gentlemen, and returned home, whither we will follow him. The widow Peck has been described as a  woman of sanguine disposition. We left her sitting with her elbows on the table, andjier chin between her hands, with a dreamy steamy plum-pudding in all its glory before her-a vision not at all dispelled by the arrival of Greedy Charley with a real substantial lump of suet. He was closely followed by Dirty Polly:, but, alas! without those conical paper bags associated with sugar and spice, and all that is nice in, grocery. "What!  no raisins-no currants-no sugar-no no- thing!"  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7943-00000122"/> 244        C$riltas ztor0. , Yes,--that!" said Dirty Polly, throwing her packet on the table; " and you're to make a good use of it." The mother caught up the packet, and impatiently tear- ing off the envelope, in a faint voice proclaimed the con- tents. "A square of yellow soap!" "A square of yellow soap!" repeated both of the chil- dren. "I should like to know of Heaven," said the widow, holding up the article towards the ceiling, "how I am to use that in- a pudding!"But Heaven made no answer. "It's for washing my face with!" cried Dirty Polly, very indignantly. "I saw him stare at me." "Well, there can't be a plum-pudding without plums," said the widow, looking the very picture of despair. But her lamentations were cut short by the entrance of Little Jack' he had brought the flour, of course. "No, mammy," said Jack, "I've got no flour at all; but there's grits."   '  "Grits!" exclaimed the widow. "Who wants grits?" But the case, when opened, appeared even worse. "Grits, indeed! It's a parcel of religious tracts!" "It a'n't my fault," said Little Jack, blubbering, and again having recourse to the old nightcap, for want of a handkerchief. "It was Mrs. Stone's. She said it was for spiritous food, and I thought she meant gruel with rum in it." "Well, well," said the widow, forgetting, mother-like, her own troubles in the grief of her little ones. "Don't cry. We shall, perhaps, have a pudding yet-who knows? Susan, maybe, will have better luck." As she spoke, Susan stepped into the room, and walk- ing gravely up to the table, began to search under her frock. "Why in mercy's name!" exclaimed the alarmed widow,   Eair. tkli's tthbin.      245 "what is the girl fumbling at? You surely have not brought the eggs in your pocket?" "I haven't brought the eggs in anything," said Susan, still groping among her petticoats. "No! Then what have you brought?" "A receipt for a plum-pudding." "A receipt!" screamed the excited widow,--" a receipt! Why it's the only thing I don't want! I can write a receipt myself. Take a pound of suet, a pound of currants, a pound of plums--but how am I to take 'em? Where's my mate- rials?" "Here they are, mother," shouted the well known voice of Ragged Peter, as he bounded into the room and threw a good-looking bundle on the table. "There's the materials!" "Then we're in luck, after all!" said the widow, ner- vously tugging at the knots of the old handkerchief, which suddenly gave way and allowed&amp; the materials to unfold themselves. "O Lord! O cri! O criminy!" ejaculated Peter, and Charley, and Little Jack, the girls using similar interjections of their own. '"Hold me!" cried the widow, "lay hold of me or I. shall run away. I'm going off my head--I'm half crazy- take 'em out of my sight! -A pair of old red plushes!" "I thought," whined Peter, " they was things from the pantry. But that comes of turning my back to the porter and exposing my rags, I wish, I do, that I was all front!" "There's Dick," exclaimed Susan; "I hear his whistle in the distance. I wonder if he has got the saucepan!" "Oh, of course we shall have that," said the widow, with great bitterness : repeated disappointments bad brought her to the mood for what she called, " arranging"Providence. "Yes, we shall have the saucepan, no doubt, just because we've nothing to put in it." She was wrong.

He hasn't brought the sauce- pan after all!" "No," said Dick,-" nor even a tin-pot. But I've brought this," and he chucked his present on the table. '"As I live!" cried the widow,--" it's an ivory totum!" sC Yes," said Dick. "It was given me by the young Brittons. They seemed to think, as we had no pudding, we should like to divert our hungers." "Divert a fool's head!" cried the poor widow, throwing herself back in her chair, and laughing hysterically. "The world's gone mad!--the worlds gone mad, and everybody is crazy! The more one wants anything, the more they give one something else-and the more one don't want any- thing, the more they force it upon you.! Here am I, going to make a plum-pudding-or rather wanting to make one- and what have I got towards it?" "A lump of suet!" muttered Charley. "Yes, that's something," said the widow. "But what else-tell me, what else have I got towards my pudding? Why a square of yellow soap-a bundle of tracts--a written receipt-a pair of red plushes,-and a tetotum!" The circle of children, down-hearted as they were, could not forbear a titter at the idea of the comical pudding to be made of such ingredients; but their mirth was speedily damped by the tears of their mother. "ItWs all over," she said, " and Christmas must go by without its pudding! What will come of it, Lord knows'! Once break through a religious rule, and who knows the consequence? There was your poor father and me: every wedding-day-in our lives, as sure as it came round, we made a point to have pickled streaky pork and pea-pudding, the same as at our nuptials; but one year somehow or another   i  xB. tC's VObtt         247 we missed-and in less than a week after he was called away."  "And why, mamma," asked Little Jack, "'why didn't you die too, then?" The widow, doubtless, would have answered this artless question; but unfortunately she was seized with such a vio- lent fit of coughing as almost took away her breath. At last she recovered, rather suddenly, and assumed the atti- tude of a -listener. "Hush! there's somebody tapping at the door." The children immediately rushed to the latch, and let in a tall thin man, in black clothes and green spectacles, with an umbrella in one hand, and a red book in the other. -A glance at the breast of his coat confirmed the widow's worst fears; an inkhorn with a pen in it was dan- gling from one of the button-holes.  "If it's rates or taxes, she said, you must seize at once-for I hav'n't a farthing." The man in black made no answer, but kept prying through his green glasses at the circle of young faces, and at length fixed upon Dick. "Didn't I see you, my lad, looking in at the window of a cook-shop?1" "Yes," answered Dick, " and you asked me about the family, and if we wasn't in distress." "Very good," said the man in black. '"And you re- plied that you were in very-deep distress indeed." "Yes, for a sarcepan," said Dick. "It was to boil our Christmas pudding in," said the widow. "But we haven't got one, sir, nor no hopes of one."   "Very good,"' said the man in black.

"You are very good, I'm sure," said the widow, quite flustered by such moral plunges from hot to cold, and then to -hot again. "As you say, sir, I have seen better days," -though how or when the gentleman said so was known only to herself. "Yes, for twenty years I have been a householder, and up to this time have never missed cele- brating my Christmas in a respectable way. And I do own it would go nigh to break my heart." "Very good, very good," said the man in black, busily writing in- the red book, from which he eventually tore out a leaf, that he folded up and presented to the widow. "There's an order, ma'am, for what you want." "The Lord in heaven bless you!" cried the widow, start- ing up from her chair, with a first impulse to throw herself on the good man's neck; and a second one to go down on her knees to him; but which she checked just as the genu- flection arrived at the proper point for a very profound courtesy. "Oh, sir!--but I'm too full to speak. Yet, if the prayers of a widow and six fatherless children " "Very good, very good, very good," said the man in black, waving off the six ragged, dirty, grateful, fatherless children, who wanted to hug and kiss him-and shuffling as fast as he could to the door, through which he bolted more like a detected swindler than a professed Samaritan. "Well, that comes of trusting to Providence," said the widow, quite forgetting a recent lapse, the least in the world, towards atheism. "Come, children, sing' O be joy- ful,' for we have got our pudding at last." The children needed no further hint; but at once joined hands, and began dancing round the table, as if the grand object of their hopes had been already smoking in the middle-Dick whistling "'Merrily danced the Quaker's wife," as loud and fast as he could rattle it, whilst the   tars. ski  $tabi4g.      249 mother ecstatically beat time with her head and foot. At last they were all out of breath. "There, that will do," said the widow. "Now then, some of you put on your hats and bonnets to- fetch the things; for, of course, it's an order on the baker and gro- cer." "It's an order," said Careful Susan, reading very deliberately the paper which she had taken from her mother's passive hand,--" an order for six yards of flannel." "Flannin!" "Yes, flannel." The widow snatched the paper; glanced at it; threw it firom her; and dropped into her chair; not as if for a temporary rest, but as though she would fain have sunk through the bottom of it, and right through the floor, and down through the foundation of the house, and six foot of earth beneath, for a quiet grave. In a moment she had six comforters at her neck; not woollen ones, but quite as warm and more affectionate, though their loving assiduities were repelled. "Don't hang on me--don't! And don't -tell me to hope, for I won't! I can't be- consoled! So don't come nigh me-no, not even if you see me fainting away--for I'm grown desperate, like an over driv beast, and don't know what I may commit." The panic-stricken children instinctively backed into a distant semicircle, and-fixipg their eyes on their parent, as if she had really been the enraged animal she had described, awaited in awful silence her next words. At last they came in a fierce harsh voice: "Wipe Jackey's nose." A brother and sister on either hand of the little one im- mediately performed the desired office; and then trem- bling waited the next command. "I  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7943-00000125"/> --2-50       ^ptismw iitQM. "Tear up that divilish paper!" Susan immediately picked up the unfortunate order, but as she hesitated, with her usual prudence, to destroy what was equivalent to six yards of flannel, Dirty Polly snatched the paper from her, and tore it up as small as she could mince it. "I have hoped as long as I could," cried the widow, suddenly starting to her feet, " but now I give up! When bad luck sets in that way, blow upon blow, it's for good. We shall never prosper again-never, never, never! We're a ruined family, root and branch-but if it was not for the sin, I'd wish nothing better at this blessed moment than to have you all six tied round my waist, enjoying a serpentine death!" At this horrible picture, which the speaker dramatized by frantically throwing up her arms, as at the fatal plunge, and then letting herself sink gradually, by a sort of curtsey, as if subsiding into the mud, the poor devoted children set up a general howl; and then broke into a series of sobbings and ejaculations, only checked by the opening of the door and the entlrance of another stranger. If the former visitor resembled a taxgatherer, his suc- cessor hardly made a more favorable impression on- the widow, from whom, hadihe asked the same question as the baronet in the Poor Gentleman, "Do I look like a bailiff?"5 he would probably have received the same answer-"I don't know but you do." He had no red book in his hand, and no inkhorn at his button-hole;thut he carried a very formidable bludgeon, and wore a very odd wig, and a very broad-brimmed hat, as much on one side as a yacht in a squall. Altogether there was such an air of disguise about him, that if not a bailiff, he was certainly, as the next best guess, a policeman in plain clothes. I believe, ma'am," said the stranger, you have just had a visit from an agent of a Benevolent Society?"   Han. vHk's ubtthing.      251 "Yes, and be hanged to him!" thought the widow, "and perhaps you're ano ther!" but she held her tongue. The stranger, therefore, repeated his question to Susan, as the eldest of the children, and was answered in the affirma- tive. "I knew it," said the stranger; " and he asked if you were not in distress; and you said that you were, and he told you he was come to relieve it." "Yes, with six yards " burst from several voices. "Hush-hold your little tongues! I know it all--with an order for six yards of flannel-wasn't it so? Six yards of flanniel for a Christmas pudding-ha! ha! ha!" The children would have laughed, too, but they were afraid. The stranger had suddenly turned into a conjuror, who knew their thoughts and wishes. "You are right, indeed, sir," said the widow. "He called himself by some hard name." "Yes, an ambulating .member," said the stranger, "of the District Visitation." I know them well. Six yards of flannel-just like them. That's their way. There was poor Biddy Hourrigan, an Irish Catholic, ma'am-they visited her, too, and found her in deep distress, not about a pud- ding though, but because she had not a farthing in the world to get her husband out of purgatory. And how do you think, ma'am, they relieved a poor soul in purgatory? Why, with a bushel of coals!" "Is it possible?" exclaimed the widow; adding, in the simplicity of her heart, " that perhaps it was in the winter." "No, ma'am, there's no winter there," said the stranger. "But to business. You have seen better days." The poor widow cast a piteous glance at the bare walls and rickety furniture of her humble dwelling. "You have been a housekeeper many years in this parish," continued the stranger, "and have been accus-  &#xD;<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7943-00000126"/> 252        t;ttimas Ktzes, tomed all your days to a plum-pudding at Christmas;. and you cannot bear to go without it-hush! not a word-I know it all by sympathy. I like myself to keep up old customs--better, most of them, than the new ones." "They are, indeed," said the widow, shaking her head. "But if it is not a liberty, may-I ask, sir, if you belong to -any society yourself?" "Why, yes, ma'am," said the stranger. "In one sense I do--namely, the-Universal Society of Human Nature. But if you mean such as the District Visitation, I do not. I tread in their steps, it is true, but it is to do what they leave undone. Their ambulators serve me for pointers to find my birds." "And a noble sort of sporting, if ever there was one!" exclaimed the widow, with enthusiasm. "It's a thousand pities more rich people don't take out licenses,- and follow the same game." "It is, indeed, a thousand pities, ma'am," said the stran- ger; " and a thousand shames to boot. In this motley world of ours, some people have their happiness cut thick, and buttered on both sides; and some have it thin, and no but- ter at all. As one of the former class, it's my duty to bestow some of my greasy superfluity on my poorer fellow- creatures. But what are all those heterogeneous articles on the table, neither eatables nor drinkables-have you been visited, ma'am, by half-a-dozen societies?" The widow, with the help of her family, related their ad- ventures in search of a pudding, at the end of which the stranger laughed so long and immoderately, and choked, and got so black in the face, that the children shrieked in chorus for fear he should go to heaven before his time. But ready- made angel as he was, heaven spared him a little longer by letting him come to; at which, however, instead of seeming overjoyed, he looked very grave, and shook his 'head, till the widow feared he had "bust a vessel."   Mrs. 8ItkVs tubing.      253 "Too bad," he said, at last, " too bad of me to laugh at such distress. I must make amends on the spot-and the best way will be to make you all, if I can, as merry as myself. There, ma'am"-and he placed in the widow's hand a purse, through the green meshes of which she perceiv- ed the glitter of sovereigns, like gold fish among weeds. "Properly laid out, that money will purchase all the re- quisites for a Christmas plum-pudding, and some odd com- forts and clothing besides. Hush-no words, I guess them all by sympathy! Only a shake of the hand all round, and W kiss from the little one. There! Be good boys and girls! God bless you all! Good-bye!" The children watched the exit of the generous stranger till the last bit of him had disappeared, and then, as if "drowned in a dream," still continued gazing on the door. "He was a real gentleman!" cried Dick. "A saint! a saint!" exclaimed Mrs. Peck, " a real saint upon earth-and I took him for a bailiff! but no matter. He don't know it, that's one comfort; and if he did, such an angelical being would forgive it. But come, children, what are you all staring at? Why don't you huzza now, as you did afore, and whistle, and take hands and dance round the table?

My patrimony, never of the largest, had been for the last year on the decrease --a herald would have emblazoned it, "ARGENT, a money-bag improper, in detriment"-and though the attenu- ating process was not excessively rapid, it was, neverthe- less, proceeding at a steady ratio. As for the ordinary means and appliances by which men contrive to recruit their exhausted exchequers, I knew none of them. Work I abhorred with a detestation worthy of a scion of nobility; and I believe you could just as soon have persuaded the lineal representative of the Howards or Percies to exhibit himself in the character of a mountebank, as have got me to trust my person on the pinnacle of a three-legged stool. The rule of three is all very well for base mechanical souls; but I flatter myself I have an intellect too large to be limited to a ledger. "Augustus," said. my poor mother to me one day, while stroking my hyacinthine. tresses--"Au- gustus, my dear boy, whatever you do, never forget that you are a gentleman." The maternal maxim sank deeply into my heart, and I never for a moment have forgotten it.   v if tit nabt wlawg 3at ear,     255 Notwithstanding this aristocratical resolution, the great practical question, "How am I to live?"5 began to thrust itself unpleasantly before me. I am one of that unfortunate class who have neither uncles nor aunts. My guardian angel was either wofully ignorant of metallurgy, or the stores had been surreptitiously ransacked. It is a great consolation amidst all the evils of life, to know that, however bad your circumstances may be, there is always somebody else in nearly the same predicament. My chosen friend and ally, Bob M'Corkindale, was equally hard up with myself, and, if possible, more averse to exer- tion. Bob was essentially a speculative man-that is, in a philosophical sense. He had once got hold of a stray volume  of Adam Smith, and muddled his brains for a whole week over the intricacies of the Wealth of Nations. The result i was a crude farrago of notions regarding the true nature of money, 'the soundness of currency, and relative value of capital, with which he nightly favored an admiring audience at "The Crow ;" for Bob was by no means-in the literal acceptation of the word--a dry philosopher. On the con- trary, he perfectly appreciated the merits of each distinct distillery; and was understood to be the compiler of a statistical work, entitled, A Tour through the Alcoholic -Districts of the Country. It had very early occurred-to me, wrho knew as much of political economy as the bagpipes, that a gentleman so well versed in the art of accumulating national wealth, must have some remote ideas of applying his principles profitably on a smaller scale. Accordingly, I gave M'Corkindale an unlimited invitation to my lodgings; and, like a good hearty fellow as he was, he availed himself every evening of the license; for I had laid in a fourteen- gallon cask of whiskey, and the quality of the malt was undeniable. These were the first glorious days of general speculation.  &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7943-00000128"/> 256       o ttrima Ftories. Railroads were emerging from the hands of the greater into the fingers of the lesser capitalists. Two successful harvests had given a fearful stimulus to the national energy; and it appeared perfectly certain that all the populous towns would be united, and the rich agricultural districts intersected, by the magical bands of iron. The columns of the newspapers teemed every week with the parturition of novel schemes; and the shares were no sooner announced than they were rapidly subscribed for. But what is the use of my saying anything more about the history of that year? Every one of us remembers it perfectly well. It was a capital year on the whole, and put money into many a pocket. About that time, Bob and I commenced operations. Our available capital, or negotiable bullion, in the language of my friend, * amounted to about three hundre'd pounds, which we set aside as a joint fund for speculation. Bob, in a series of learned discourses, had convinced me that it was not only folly, but a positive sin, to leave this sum lying in the. bank at a pitiful rate of interest, and otherwise unemployed, whilst every one else in the kingdom was having a pluck at the public pigeon. Somehow or other, we were unlucky in our first attempts. Speculators are like wasps; for when they have once got hold of a ripening and peach-like pro- ject, they keep it rigidly for their own swarm, and repel the approach of interlopers. Notwithstanding all our efforts, and very ingenious ones they were, we never, in a single instance, succeeded in procuring an allocation of original shares; and though we did now and then make a hit by purchase, we more frequently bought at a premium, and parted with our scrip at a discount. At the end of six months we were not twenty pounds richer than before. "This will never do," said Bob, as he sat one evening in my rooms compounding his second tumbler. "I thought we were living in an enlightened age; but I find I was   3gloL fe m=b4 Aoneg sMrtg Carr.    257 mistaken. That brutal spirit of monopoly is still abroad and uncurbed. The principles of free-trade are utterly for- gotten, or misunderstood. Else how comes it that David Spreul received -but yesterday an allocation of two hundred shares in the Westermidden Junction; whilst your appli- cation and mine, for a thousand each, were overlooked? Is this a state of things to be tolerated? Why should he, with his fifty thousand pounds, receive a slapping premium, whilst our three hundred of available capital remains unre- presented? The fact is monstrous, and demands the immediate and serious interference of the legislature." "'It is a bloody shame," said I, fully alive to the mani- fold advantages of a premium. "I'll tell you what, Dunshunner," rejoined M'Corkin- - dale, "it's no use going on this way. We haven't shown half pluck enough.- These fellows consider -us as snobs, because we don't take the bull by the horns. Now's the time for a bold stroke. The public are quite ready to sub- scribe for anything-and we'll start a railway for ourselves." "Start a railway with three hundred pounds of capital!" "Pshaw, man! you don't know what you're talking about-we've a great deal more capital than that. Have not I told you seventy times over, that everything a man has-his coat, his hat, the tumbler he drinks from, nay, his very corporeal existence-is absolute marketable capital? What do you call that fourteen-gallon cask, I should like to know?"  "A compound of hoops and staves, containing about a quart and a half of spirits--ou have effectually accounted for the rest." "Then it has gone to the fund of profit and loss, that's all. Never let me hear you sport those old theories again. Capital is indestructible, as I am ready to prove to you any day, in half an hour. But let us sit down seriously to  &#xD;<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC7943-00000129"/> 258          I 6  trr business. ,We are rich enough to pay for the advertise- ments and that is all we need care for in the meantime. The public is sure to step in, and bear us out handsomely with the rest."    , "But where in the face of the habitable globe shall the railway be? England is out of the question, and I hardly know a spot in the. Lowlands, that is not occupied al- ready. ' "What do you say to a Spanish scheme--the Alcantara Union? Hang me if I know whether Alcantara is in Spain or Portugal; but nobody else does, and the one is quite as good as the other. Or what would you think of the Palermo Railway, with a branch to the sulphur mines? That would be popular in the North--or the Pyrenees Direct? They would all go to a premium." ( I must confess I should prefer a line at home." "Well then, why not try the Highlands? There must be lots of traffic there in the shape of sheep, grouse, and Cockney tourists, not to mention salmon and other etceteras, Couldn't we tip them a railway somewhere in the West?" "There is Glenmutchkin, for instance " "Capital, my dear fellow! Glorious! By Jove, first rate?" shouted Bob, in an ecstasy of delight. "There's a distillery there, you know, and a fishing village at the foot; at least there used to be six years ago, when I was living with the exciseman. There may be some bother about the population, though. The last laird shipped every mother's son of the aboriginal Celts to America-but, after all, that's not of much consequence. I see the whole thing! Un- rivalled scenery-stupendous waterfalls-herds of black cattle-spot where Prince Charles Edward met Macgrugar of Glengrugar and his clan! We could not possibly have lighted on a more promising place. Hand us over that sheet of paper, like a good fellow, and a pen. There is no time 9   Iol t m6 w Mjo on:rlg a:St etar, - 259 to- be lost, and the sooner we get out the prospectus the better." ," But, Heaven bless you, Bob, there's a great deal to be thought of first. Who are we to get for a provisional committee?'  "That's very true," said Bob, musingly. "We must, treat them to some respectable names, that is, good sound- ing ones. I'm afraid there is little chance of our producing a Peer to begin with." - "None whatever--unless- we could invent one, and that's hardly safe--Burke' s Peerage has gone through too many editions. Couldn't we try the Dormants?5" "That :would be rather dangerous-in the teeth of the standing orders. But what do you' say to a baronet? There's Sir Polloxfen Tremens. He got himself served the other day to a Nova Scotia Baronetcy,- with just as much title as you or I have; and he has sported the ribanid, and dined out on the strength of it ever since. He'll join us at once, for he has not sixpence to lose." "Down with him, then," and we headed the Provisional list with the pseudo Orange-tawny. "Now," said Bob, " it's quite indispensable, as this is a Highland line, that we should put forward a Chief or two. That has always a great effect upon the English, whose feudal notions are rather of the mistiest, and principally derived from Waverley." "Why not write yourself down as the Laird of M, Cork- indale?" said I. "' I dare say you would not be negatived by a counter-claim." "That would hardly do, ' replied Bob, " as I intend to be Secretary. After all what's the use of thinking about it? Here goes for an extempore Chief," and the villain wrote down the name of Tavish M'Tavish of Invertavish, "I say, though," said I, "we must have a real High-  &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7943-00000130"/> 260        Zama tze lander on the list. If we go on in this way it will become a Justiciary matter." You're devilish scrupulous, Gus," said Bob, who, left to himself, would have stuck in the names of the heathen gods and goddesses, or borrowed his directors from the Ossiaric chronicles, rather than have delayed the prospectus. "Where the mischief are we to find the men? I can think of no others likely to go the whole hog; can you?"' "I don't know a single Celt... in Glasgow except old M^Closkie, the drunken porter, at the corner of Jamaica street." "He's the very man! I suppose, after the manner of his tribe, he will do anything for a pint of whiskey. But what shall we call him? Jamaica street, I fear, will hardly do for a designation." Call him 'The M'Closkie.' It will be sonorous in the ears of the Saxon." "Bravo!"And another chief was added to the roll of the clans. "Now," said Bob, " we must put you down. Recollect, all the management-that is, the allocation--will be in- trusted to you. Augustus-,you haven't a middle name, I think? Well then, suppose we interpolate "Reginald;" it has a smack of the Crusades. Augustus Reginald Dun- shunner, Esq., of where, in the name of Munchausen?" I'm sure I don't know. I never had any lanid beyond the contents of a flower-pot. Stay--I rather think I have a superiority somewhere about Paisley." "Just the thing'," cried Bob. "It's heritable property, and therefore titular. What's the denomination?" u"St. Mirrens.'" "Beautiful! Dunshunner of St. Mirrens, I give you ioy! Had you discovered that a little sooner-and I wonder you did not think of it-we might both of us have   bao bfe mabt Iaeneg 'Arct ear.   261 had lots of allocations. These are not- the times to conceal hereditary distinctions. But now comes the -serious work. We must have one or two men of known wealth upon the list. The chaff is nothing without a decoy-bird. Now, can't you help me with a name?" i"In that case," said I, " the game is up, and the whole scheme, exploded. I would as soon undertake to evoke the ghost of Croesus." "Dunshunner," said Bob, very seriously, " to be a man of information you are possessed of marvellous few resources. I am quite ashamed of you. Now listen to me. I have thought deeply upon this subject, and am quite convinced that with some little trouble we may secure the co-operation of a most wealthy and influential body-one, too, that is generally supposed to have stood aloof from all speculation of the kind, and whose name would be a tower of strength in the monied quarters. I allude,", continued Bob, reaching across for the kettle, " to the great Dissenting Interest." "The what?" cried I, aghast.  "The great Dissenting Interest. You can't have failed to observe the row they have lately been making about Sunday travelling and education. Old Sam Sawley, the coffin-maker, is their principal spokesman here; and wher- ever he goes the rest will follow, like a flock of sheep bounding after a, patriarchal ram. I propose, therefore, to wait upon him to-morrow, and request his co-operation in a scheme which is not only to. prove profitable, but to make head against the lax principles of the age. Leave me alone to tickle him. I consider his name--and those of one or two others belonging to the same meeting-house-fellows with bankLstock, and all sorts of tin-as perfectly secure. These dissenteis smell a premium from an almost incredible distance. We can fill up the rest of the committee with' cyphers, and the whole thing is done."      ,  &#xD;<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC7943-00000131"/> 262        doltlmas Mto ritm f "But the engineer--we must announce such an officer as a matter of course." "I never thought of that," said Bob. "Couldn't we hire a fellow from one of the steamboats?" "I fear that might get us into trouble. You know there are such things as gradients and sections to be pre- pared. But there's Watty Solder, the gasfitter, who failed the other day. He's a sort of civil engineer by trade, and will jump at the proposal like a trout at the tail of a May-fly.  "Agreed. Now, then, let's fix the number of shares. This is our first experiment, and I think we ought to be moderate. No sound political economist is avaricious. Let us say twelve thousand at twenty pounds a-piece." "So be it." "Well then, that's arranged. I'll see Sawley and the rest to-morrow-settle with Solder, and then write out the prospectus. You look in upon me in the evening, and we'll revise it together. Now, by your leave, let's have in the Welsh rabbit andd another tumbler to drink success and prosperity th the Glenmutchkin Railway." I confess, that when I rose on the morrow, with a slight headache and a tongue indifferently parched, I recalled to memory, not without perturbation, the-conversation of the previous evening. I felt relieved, however, after two spoon- fuls of carbonate of soda, and a glance at the newspaper, wherein I perceived the announcement of no less than four other schemes equally preposterous with our own. ABut, after all, what right had I to assume that the Glenmutchkin project would prove an ultimate failure? I had not a scrap of statistical information that might entitle me to form such an- opinion. At any rate, Parliament, by substituting the Board of Trade as an initiating body of inquiry, had created a responsible tribunal, and freed us from the chance of   olo befoe mebt oviog noat star.   263 obloquy. I saw before me a vision of six monthsl steady gambling, at manifest advantage, in the shares before a report could possibly be pronounced, or our proceedings in any way overhauled. Of course I' attended that evening punctually at my friend M7Corkindale's.- Bob was in high feather; for Sawley no sooner heard of the principles upon, which the failway was to be conducted, and his own nomi- nation as a director, than he gave in his adhesion, and pro- mised his unflinching support to the uttermost. The Prospectus was headed as follows:-- "DIRECT GLTENMUTCH iKIf] RAILWAY. IN 12,000 SHARES OF 20 EACH. DEPOSIT 1 PER SHARE. Provisional Committee. SIR POLLOXFEN TREMTES, Bart. of Toddyrains.

"What do you think of that? If it doesn't do the business effectually, I shall submit to be called a Dutchman."5 "Very masterly, indeed," said I. "But who the deuce is Mhic-Mhac-vich-Induibh?" "A bona-fide chief, I assure you, though a little reduced: I picked him up upon the Broonmielaw. His grandfather had an island somewhere to the west of the Hebrides; but it is not laid down in the maps." "And the Captain of M'Alcohol?" "A crack distiller." ) "And the Factor for Glentumblers?" "His principal customer. But, bless you, my dear St. Mirrens! don't trouble yourself any more about the com- mittee.

You and I must restrict our- selves to a couple of thousand shares a-piece. That's only a third of the whole, but it won't do to be greedy." "But, Bob, consider!

It was read, canvassed, and generally approved of. During the afternoon, I took an opportunity of looking into the Tontine, and whilst under shelter of the Glasgow Hetrald, my ears were solaced with such ejaculations as the following: "I say, Jimsy, hae ye seen this grand new prospectus for a railway tae Glenmutchkin?" "Aye-it looks no that ill. The Hieland lairds are pitting their best fit foremost. Will ye apply for shares?"1 "I think I'll tak' twa hundred. Wha's Sir Polloxfen Tremens?" "He'll be yin o' the Ayrshire folk. He used to rin horses at the Paisley races." ("The devil he did!" thought I.) "D'ye ken ony o' the directors, Jimsy?" "I ken Sawley fine. Ye may depend on't, it's a gude thing if he's in't; for he's a howkin' body." "Then it's sure to gae up. What prem. d'ye think it will bring?" "Twa pund a share, and may be mair."  "'Od, I'll apply for three hundred!" "Heaven bless you, my dear countrymen!" thought I, as I sallied forth to refresh myself with a basin of soup, "do but maintain this liberal and patriotic feeling-this thirst for national improvement, internal communication, and premiums-a short while longer, and I know whose fortune will be made." On the following morning my breakfast table was covered with shoals of letters, from fellows whom I scarcely ever had- spoken to-or who, to use a franker phraseology, had scarcely ever condescended to speak to me-entreating my influence as a director to obtain them shares in the new 12  &#xD;<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7943-00000133"/> 266        Qimtmm Btoaru  l -undertaking. I never bore malice in my life, so I chalked them down, without any favoritism, for a certain propor- tion. Whilst engaged in this charitable work, the door flew open, and M'Corkindale, looking utterly haggard with excitement, rushed in. "'You may buy an estate whenever you please, Dun- shunner," cried he-; "the world's gone perfectly mad. I have been to Blazes, the broker, and he tells me that the whole amount of the stock has been subscribed for four times already, and he has not yet got in the returns from Edinburgh and Liverpool." "Are they good names though, Bob-sure cards-none of your M1Closkies and M'Alcohols?" A The first names in the city, I assure you, and most of them holders for investment. I wouldn't take ten millions for their capital." "Then the sooner we close the list the better.", ' I think so too. I suspect a rival company will be out I before long. Blazes says the shares are selling already con- ditionally on allotment, at seven and sixpence premium." "The deuce they are! I say, Bob, since we have the l cards in our hands, would it not be wise to favor them with a few hundreds at that rate? A bird in. the hand, you know, is worth two in the bush, eh?" "I. know no such maxim in political economy," replied the secretary. "Are you mad, Dunshunner? How are the shares ever to go up, if it gets wind that the directors are selling already? Our business just now, is to bull the line, not to bear it; and if you will trust me, I shall show them such an operation on the ascending scale as the Stock Exchange -has not witnessed for this long and many a day. Then, to-morrow I shall advertise in the papers, that the committee having received applications for ten times the amount of stock, have been compelled unwillingly to close /   i ^ye ms  Af orAm Nu Par. .   2B67 the lists. That will be a slap in the face to the dilatory gentlemen, and send up the shares like wildfire., Bob was right. No sooner did the advertisement appear, than a simultaneous groan was uttered by some hundreds of disappointed speculators, who, with unwonted and unnecessary caution had been anxious to see their way a little, before committing themselves to our splendid enter- prise. In consequence, they rushed into the market, with intense anxiety to make what terms they could at the earliest stage, and the seven and sixpence of premium was doubled in the course of a forenoon. The allocation passed over very peaceably. Sawley, Heckles, Jobson, Grabbie, and the Captain of M'Alcohol, besides myself, attended, and took part in the business. We, were also threatened with the presence of the M'Closkie and Vich-Induibh; but M'Corkindale, entertaining some reason- able doubts as to the effect which their corporeal appear- ance might have upon the representatives of the dissenting interest, had taken the precaution to get them snugly housed in a tavern, where an unbounded supply ofgratui- tous Farintosh deprived us of the benefit of their experience. W  Te, however, allotted them twenty shares a-piece. Sir Polloxfen Tremens sent a handsome, though rather illegible letter of apology, dated from an island in Lochlomond , where he was said to be detained on particular business. Mr. -Sawley, -who officiated as our chairman, was kind enough, before parting, to pass a very flattering eulogium upon the excellence and candor of all the preliminary arrangements. It would now, he said, go forth to the public that this line was not, like some others he could mention, a mere bubble emanating from the stank of private interest, but a solid, lasting superstructure, based upon the principles of sound return for capital, and serious evangelical truth  &#xD;<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7943-00000134"/> 268         *nxftema Storfies. (hear, hear). The time was fast approaching, when the gravestone, with the words ' HC OBIIT" chiselled upon it, would be placed at the head of all the other lines which rejected the grand opportunity of conveying education to the stoker. The stoker, in his (Mr. Sawley's) opinion, had a right to ask the all-important question, "Am I not a manll and a brother?" (Cheers.) Much had been said and written lately about a work called Tracts for the Times. With the opinions contained in that publication he was not conver- sant, as it was conducted by persons of another community from that to which he (Mr. Sawley) had the privilege to belong., But he hoped very soon, under the auspices of the Glenmutchkin Railway Company, to see a new peri- odical established, under the title of Tracts for the Trains. He never foy a moment would relax his efforts to knock a nail into the poffin, which, he might say, was already made, and measured, and cloth-covered for the occasion of all establishments; and with these sentiments, and the con- viction that the shares must rise, could it be doubted that he would remain a fast friend of the interests of this Com- pany for ever? (Much cheering.) After having delivered this address, Mr. Sawley affec- tionately squeezed the hands of his brother directors, and departed, leaving several of us much overcome. As, how- ever, M'Corkindale had told me that every one of Sawley's shares had been disposed of inmarket the day before, I felt less compunction t having refused to allow that excellent man an extra thousand beyond the amount he had ap- plied for, notwithstanding his broadest hints, and even pri- vate entreaties. "Confound the greedy hypocrite!" said Bob ; " does he think we shall let him Burke the line for nothing? No-no! let him go to the brokers and buy his shares back, if he   l        Ads, Ioty t mabe mwlteg gast liar. 269 thinks they are likely to rise. I'll be bound he has made a cool hundred out of them already." On the day which succeeded the allocation, the following entry appeared in the Glasgow share lists. "Direct Glenmutchkin Railway. 15s. 15s. 6d. 15s. 6d. 16s. 15s. 6d. 16s. 16s. 6d. 16s. 6d. 16s. 17s. 18s. 18s. 19s. 6d. 21s. 21s. -22s. 6d. 24s. 25s. 6d. 27s. 29s. 29s. 6d. 30s. 31s. pm." "They might go higher, and they ought to go higher," said Bob, musingly; " but there's not much more stock to come and go upon, and those two share sharks, Jobson and Grabbie, I know, will be in the market to-morrow. We must not let them have the whip-hand of us. I think upon the whole, Dunshunner, though it's letting them go dog cheap, that we ought to sell half our shares at the present premium, whilst there is a certainty of getting it." "Why not sell the whole? I'm sure I have no objec- tions to part with every stiver of the scrip on such terms." "Perhaps," said Bob, " upon general principles you may be right; but then remember that we have a vested interest in the line." "Vested interest be hanged!" "That's very well-at the same time it is no use to kill your salmon in a hurry. The bulls have done their work pretty well for us, and we ought to keep something on hand for the bears; they are snuffing at it already. I could almost swear that some of those fellows who have sold to-day are working for a time-bargain." We accordingly got rid of a couple of thousand shares, the proceeds of which not only enabled us to discharge the deposit loan, but left us a material surplus. Under these circumstances, a two-handed banquet was proposed and unanimously carried, the commencement of which I dis- tinctly remember, but am rather dubious as to the end.  &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7943-00000135"/> 270        irma8 Gitom So many stories have lately been circulated to the pre- judice of railway directors, that I think it my duty to state that this entertainment was scrupulously defrayed by ourselves, and not carried to account, either of the pre- liminary survey, or the expenses of the provisional com- mittee. Nothing effects so great a metamorphosis in the bearing of the outer man, as a sudden change of fortune. The anemone of the garden differs scarcely more from its unpretending prototype of the woods, than Robert M'Cor- kindale, Esq., Secretary and Projector of the Glenmutchkin Railway, differed from Bob M'Corkindale, the seedy fre- quenter of "The Crow." In the days of yore, men eyed the surtout-napless at the velvet collar, and preternaturally white at the seams-which Bob vouchsafed to wear, with looks of dim suspicion, as if some faint reminiscence, similar to that which is said to recall the memory of a former state of existence, suggested to them a vision that the garment had once been their own. Indeed, his whole appearance was then wonderfully second-hand. Now he had cast his slough. A most undeniable Taglioni, with trimmings just bordering upon frogs, gave dignity to his demeanor and [ twofold amplitude to his chest.. The horn eyeglass was exchanged for one of purest gold, the dingy high-lows for well-waxed Wellingtons, the Paisley fogle for the fabric of the China loom. Moreover, he walked with a swagger, and affected in common conversation a peculiar dialect which he opined to be the purest English, but which no one-except a bagman-could be reasonably expected to understand. His pockets were invariably crammed with share lists; and he quoted, if he did not comprehend, the money article from the Times. This sort of assumption, though very ludicrous in itself, goes down wonderfully. Bob gradually became a sort of authority, and his opinions   ofb bse mrab Mtom2 Nart Im:.    271 got quoted on 'Change. He was no ass, notwithstanding his peculiarity, and made good use of his opportunities. For myself I bore my new dignities with an air of modest meekness. A certain degree of starchness is indis- pensable for a railway director, if he means to go forward in his high calling and prosper; he must abandon all juvenile eccentricities, and aim at the appearance of a decided enemy to free trade in the article of Wild Oats.- Accord- ingly, as the first step towards respectability, I eschewed colored waistcoats, and gave out that I was a marrying man. No man under forty, unless he is a positive idiot, will stand forth as a theoretical bachelor. It is all nonsense to say that there is anything unpleasant in being courted. Atten- tion, whether from male or female, tickles the vanity, and although I have reasonable, and, I hope, not unwholesome regard for the gratification of my other appetites, I confess that this same vanity is by far the most poignant of the whole. I therefore surrendered myself freely to the soft allurements thrown in my way by such matronly denizens of Glasgow as were possessed of stock in the shape of marriageable daughters; and walked the more readily into their toils, because every party, though nominally for the purpose of tea, wound up with a hot supper, and something hotter still by way of assisting tWle digestion. I don't know whether it was my determined conduct at the allocation, my territorial title, or a most exaggerated idea of my circumstances, that worked upon the mind of Mr. Sawley. Possibly it was a combination of the three; but sure enough few days had elapsed before I received a formal card of invitation to a tea and serious conversation. Now serious conversation is a sort of thing that I never shone in, possibly because my early studies were framed in a different direction ; but as I really was unwilling to offend the respectable coffin-maker, and as I found that the Captain  &#xD;<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7943-00000136"/> 272 2i1tm         0iarie of M'Alcohol-a decided trump in his way-had also received a summons, I notified my acceptance. M'Alcohol and 1 went together.  The captain, an- -enormous brawny Celt, with superhuman whiskers, and a ishock of the fieriest hair, had figged himself out, more majorum, in the full Highland costume. I never saw Rob Roy on the stage look half so dignified or ferocious. He glittered from head to foot, with dirk, pistol, and skean- dhu, and at least a hundred-weight of cairngorms cast a prismatic glory around his person. I felt quite abashed beside him. We were ushered into Mr. Sawley's drawing-room. Round the walls, and /at considerable distances from each other, were seated about a dozen-chlaracters, male and female, all of them dressed in sable, and wearing counn tenances of woe. Sawley advanced and Wrung me by the hand with so piteous an expression of visage, that I could not help thinking some awful catastrophe had just befallen his family. . "You are welcome, Mr. Dunshunner, welcome to my humble tabernacle. Let me present you to Mrs. Sawley"-- and a lady who seemed to have bathed in the Yellow Sea, rose from her seat and favored me with a profound curtsey. "My daughter--Miss Selina Sawley." I felt in my brain the scorching glance of the -two darkest eyes it ever was my fortune to behold, as the beauteous Selina looked up from the perusal of her handker- chief hem. It was a pity that the other features. were not corresponding; for the nose was flat, and the -mouth of such dimensions, that a Harlequin might have jumped down it with impunity--but the eyes were splendid. In obedience to a sign from the hostess, I sank into a chair beside Selina-; and not knowing exactly what to say, hazarded some observation about the weather.   Jlob bfe maZ 4o10ag gadt M2r7 27t "Yes, it is indeed a suggestive season. How deeply Mr. Dunshunner, we ought to feel the pensive progress of autumn towards a soft and premature decay!  I always think, about this time of the year, that nature is falling intc a consumption!" "To be sure, ma'am,"' said I, rather taken aback by thi( style of colloquy, " the trees are looking devilishy hectic.' "Ah, you have remarked that too! Strange! it wa, but yesterday that I was wandering through Kelvin Grove and as the phantom breeze brought down the withered foliage from the spray, I thought how probable it was, that they might ere long rustle over young and glowing hearts deposited prematurely in the tomb!" This, which struck me as a very passable imitation of Dickens's pathetic writings, was a poser. In default of language, I looked Miss Sawley straight in the face, and attempted a substitute for a sigh. I was rewarded with a tender glance. "Ah!9" said she, "I see you are a congenial spirit. How delightful, and yet how rare is it to meet with any one who thinks in unison with yourself! Do you ever walk in the Necropolis, Mr. Dunshunner? It is my favorite haunt of a morning. There we can wean ourselves, as it were, from life, and, beneath the melancholy yew and cypress, anticipate the setting star. How often there have I seen the proces- sion-the funeral of some very, very little child" "Selina, my love," said Mrs. Sawley, " have the kindness to ring for the cookies.)" I, as in duty bound, started up to save the fair enthusiast the trouble, and was not sorry to observe my seat immedi- ately occupied by a very cadaverous gentleman, who was evidently jealous of the progress I was rapidly making. Sawley, with an air of great mystery, informed me that this was a Mr. Dalgleish of Raxmathrapple, the representative 12'  &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7943-00000137"/> 274        &amp;atma Librea. of an ancient Scottish family, who claimed an important heritable office. The name, I thought, was familiar to me, but there was something in the appearance of Mr. Dalgleish which, notwithstanding the smiles of Miss Selina, rendered a rivalship in that quarter utterly out of the question. I hate injustice, so- let me do due honor in description to the Sawley banquet. The tea-urn most literally corre- sponded to its name. The table was decked out with divers platters, containing seed-cakes cut into rhomboids, almond biscuits, and ratafia drops; but somehow or other they looked clammy an-d damp, and, for the life of me, I could not divest myself of the idea that the selfsame viands had figured, not long before, as funeral refreshments at a dirgie. No such suspicion seemed to cross the mind of Mr. -M'Alcohol, who had hitherto remained uneasily surveying his nails in a corner; but at the first symptom of food started forwards, and was in the act of making a clean sweep of the china, when Sawley proposed the singular preliminary of a hymn. The hymn was accordingly sung. I am thankful to say it was such a one as I never heard before, or expect to hear' again; and unless it was composed by the Reverend Saun- ders Peden in an hour of paroxysm on the moors, I cannot conjecture the author. After this original symphony, tea was discussed, and after tea, to my amazement, more hot brandy and water than I ever remember to have seen circulated at the most convivial party. Of course this effected a radical change in the spirits and conversation of the circle. It was again my lot to be placed by the side of the fascinating Selina, whose sentimentality gradually thawed away beneath the influence of sundry sips, which she accepted with a delicate reluctance. This time Dalgleish of Raxmathrapple had not the remotest chance. - M'Alcohol got furious, sang Gaelic songs, and even delivered a sermon   IV(oae atc me Baonjg ;aZ le=m.   27 in genuine Erse, without incurring a rebuke; whilst, f my own part, I must needs confess that I waxed unnece sarily amorous, and the last thing I recollect was tl pressure of Mr. Sawley's hand at the door, as he denominate me his dear boy, and hoped I would soon come back an visit Mrs. Sawley and Selina. The recollection of thee passages next morning was the surest antidote to m return. Three weeks had elapsed, and still the Glenmutchki Railway shares were at a premium, though rather low( than when we sold. Our engineer, Watty Solder, returne from his first survey of the line, along with an assistai who really appeared to have some remote glimmerings o the science and practice of mensuration. It seemed, from verbal report, that the line was actually practicable; an the survey would have been completed in a very shol time-"If," according to the account of Solder, " there ha been ae hoos in the glen. But ever sin' the distiller stoppit-and that was - twa year last Martinmas--ther wasna a hole whaur a Christian could lay his head, muckl less get white sugar to his toddy, forbye the change-hous at the clachan; and the ault luckie- that keepit it was sai forfochten wi' the palsy, and maist in the dead-thrawf There was naebody else living within twal miles o' the linE barring a tacksman, a lamiter,- and a bauldie." We had some difficulty in preventing Mr. Solder fror making this report open and patent to the public, whic premature disclosure might have interfered materially wit] the preparation of our traffic tables, not to mention th marketable value of the shares. We therefore kept hin steadily at work out of Glasgow, upon a very liberal allow ance, to which, apparently, he did not object. '"Dunshunner," said M'Corkindale to me one day, ": suspect that there is something going on about our railway  &#xD;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7943-00000138"/> 21A6        pgemrfnSoi ^to. more than we are aware of. Have you observed that the shares are preternaturally high just now?" "So much the better. Let's sell." "I did so' this morning--both yours and mine, at two pounds ten shillings premium." ".The deuce you did! Then we're out of the whole concern." "Not quite. If my suspicions are correct, there's a good deal more money yet to be got from the speculation. Somebody has been bulling the stock without orders; and, as they can have no information which we are not perfectly up to, depend upon it, it is done for a purpose. I suspect Sawley and his friends. They have never been quite happy since the allocation; and I caught him, yesterday pumping our broker in the back shop. We'll see in a day or two. If they-are beginning a bearing operation, I know how to catch them." And, in effect, the bearing operation commenced. Next day, heavy sales were effected for delivery in three weeks; and the stock, as if water-logged, began to sink. The same thing continued for the following two days, until the premium became nearly nominal. In the meantime, Bob and I, in conjunction with two leading capitalists whom he let into the secret, bought up steadily every share that was offered; and at the end of a fortnight we found that we had purchased rather more than double the amount of the whole original stock. Sawley and his disciples, who, as M'Corkindale suspected, were at the bottom of the whole transaction, having beared to their hearts' content, now came into the market to purchase, in order to redeem their engagements. The following extract from the weekly share-list will show the result of their endeavors to regain their lost position:-   100fx Luz njbt I10arg gust Hear.   27  Sat. Mon. Tues. Wed. Thurs. FrId.

I have no means of knowing in what frame of mind Mr Sawley spent the Sunday, or whether he had recourse fo: mental consolation to Peden; but on Monday morning h, presented himself at my door in full funeral costume, witl about a quarter of a mile of crape swathed round his hat black gloves, and a countenance infinitely more doleful thai if he had been attending the interment of his belove( wife. "Walk in, Mr. Sawley," said I cheerfully. "What o long time it is since I have had the pleasure of seeing you- tod long, indeed, for brother directors. How are Mrs Sawley and Miss Selina-won't you take a cup of coffee?' "Grass, sir, grass!" said Mr. Sawley, with a sigh likb the groan of a furnace-bellows.

I am afraid there is something far wrong indeed in the ]present state of our stock." "Why, to be sure it is high; but that, you know, is  token of the public confidence in the line. After all, the rise is nothing compared to that of several English railways; and individually, I suppose, neitherof us has any reason tc complain."  "I don't'like it," said Sawley, watching me over the margin of his coffee-cup. "I don't like it.

Selina, who is a sensible girl, has serious qualms on the subject."3 "Then, why not get out of it? I have no objections to run the risk, and if you like to transact with me, I will pay you ready money for every share you have at the present market price." Sawley writhed uneasily in his chair. "Will you sell me five hundred, Mr. Sawley? Say the word and it is a bargain." "A time-bargain?'" quavered the coffin-maker. "No. Money down, and scrip handed over." "H can't. The fact is, my dear young friend, I have sold all my stock already!" "Then permit me to ask, Mr. Sawley, what, possible objection can you have to. the present aspect of affairs-? You do not *surely suppose that we are going to issue new shares and bring down the harket, simply because you have realized at a handsome premium?' 4'A handsome premium! O Lord!" moaned Saw- ley. "Why, what did you get for them?." "Four, three, and -two and a half." "A very considerable profit, indeed," said I; "and you ought to be abundantly thankful. We shall talk this matter over at another time, Mr. Sawley, but just now I must beg you to excuse me. I have a particular engagement this morning with my broker-rather a heavy transaction to settle--and so " "It's no use beating about the bush any longer," said Mr. Sawley in an excited tone, and at the same time dash- ing down his crape-covered castor on the floor.

It was I who sold them!" "Well!" "Mother of Moses, sir! don't you see I'm ruined?" "By no means-but you must not swear. I pay over the money for your scrip, and you pocket a premium. It seems to me a very simple transaction." "But I tell you I haven't got the scrip!" cried Sawley, gnashing his teeth, whilst the large beads of perspiration gathered upon his brow. "That is very unfortunate! Have you lost it?." "No!-the devil tempted me, and I oversold!" There was a long pause, during which I assumed an aspect of serious and dignified rebuke. "Is it possible?" said I in a low tone, after the manner of Kean's offended fathers. "What! you, Mr. Sawley--the stoker's friend-the enemy of gambling-the father of Selina--condescend to so equivocal a transaction? You amaze me! But I never was the man to press heavily on a friend,"-rhere Sawley brightened up--" your secret is safe with me, and it shall be your iown fault if it reaches the ears of the Session. Pay me over the difference, at the preslent market price, and I release you of your obligation." "Then I'm in the Gazette, that's all," said Sawley, doggedly, " and a wife and nine beautiful babes upon the parish! 1 had hoped other things from you, Mr. Dun- shunnerr-I thought you and Selina " "Nonsense, man! Nobody goes into the Gazette just now-it will be time enough when the general crash comes.

Confound fractions! in these days one can afford to be liberal." "I haven't got it," said Sawley. ' You have no idea how bad our trade has been of late, for nobody seems to think of dying. I have not sold a gross of coffins this fort- i night. But I'll tell you what-I'll give you five thousand down in cash, and ten thousand in shares-further I can't go. .", "Now, Mr. Sawley," said I, "I may be blamled by world- ly-minded men for what I am going to do; but I am a man of principle, and feel deeply for the situation of your amiable wife and family. I bear no malice, though it is quite clear that you intended to make me the sufferer. Pay me fifteen thousand over the counter, and we cry quits for ever." "Won't you take Camlachie Cemetery shares? They are quite sure to go up." "No." "Twelve hundred (owcaddens Water, with an issue of newstock next week?" "Not if they disseminated the Ganges." "A thousand Ramshorn Gas-four per cent. guaranteed until the act?" "Not if they promised twenty, and melted down the sun in their retort!" "Blawweary Iron. Best spec. going." "No, I tell you once for all. If you don't like my offer -and it is an uncommonly liberal one-say so, and I'll ex- pose you this afternoon upon 'Change."  [- "Well, then--thee's a checque. But may the" "Stop, sir! Any such profane expressions, and I shall insist upon the original bargain. So, then--now we're quits. I wish you a very good morning, Mr. Sawley, and better luck next time. Pray remember me to your amiable family." The door had hardly closed upon the discomfited coffin-   ADoZ tet mabe Btoaned $afd ax.   281 maker, and I was still in the preliminary steps of an extem- porepas seul, intended as the outward demonstration of exceeding inward joy, -when Bob M'Corkindale entered. I told him the result of the morning's conference. "You have let him off too easily," said the Political Eco- nomist. "Had I been his creditor, I certainly should have sacked the shares into the bargain. There is nothing like rigid dealing between man and man." "I am contented with moderate profits," said I; "besides, the image of Selina overcame me. How goes it with Jobson and Grabbie?" "Jobson has paid, and Grabbie compounded. Heckles -may he die an evil death!-has repudiated, become a lame duck, and waddled; but no doubt his estate will pay a dividend."  "So, then, we are clear of the whole Glenmutchkin business, and a handsome profit." "A fair interest for the outlay of capital-nothing more. But I'm not quite done with the concern yet." "How so? not another bearing operation?  "No; that cock would hardly fight. But you forget that I am secretary to the company, and have a small account against them for services already rendered. I must do what I can to carry the bill through Parliament; and, as you have now sold your whole shares, I advise you to resign from the direction, go down straight to Glenmatchkin, and qualify yourself for a witness. We shall give you five guineas a day, and defray all your expenses." "Not a bad notion. But what has become of M'Closkie, and the other fellow with the jaw-breaking name?" "Vich-Induibh? I have looked after their interests, as in duty bound, sold their shares at a large premium, and despatched them to their native hills on annuities."

As the company seemed breaking up, I thought I c6uld not do better than take M'Corkindale's hint, and accordingly betook myself to, Glenmutchkin, along with the Captain of M'Alcohol, and we quartered ourselves upon the Factor for Glentumblers. We found Watty Solder very shaky, and his assistant also lapsing into habits of painful inebriety. We saw little of them except of an evening, for we shot and fished the whole day, and made ourselves remarkably com- fortable. By singular good-luck, the plans and sections were lodged in time, and -the Board of Trade very hand- somely reported in our favor, with a recommendation of what they were pleased to call " the Glenmutchkin system,' "and a hope that it might generallybe carried out." What this system was, I never clearly understood; but, of course, none of us had any objections. This circumstance gave an additional impetus to the shares, and they once more went up. I was, however, too cautious to plunge a second time into Charybdis, but M'Corkindale did, and again emerged with plunder. When the time came for the parliamentary contest, we all emigrated to London. I still recollect, with lively satis- faction, the many pleasant days we spent in the metropolis at the company's expense. There were just a neat fifty of us, and we occupied the whole of -a hotel. The discussion before the committee was long and formidable. We were opposed by four other companies who patronized lines, of which the nearest was at least a hundred miles distant from Glenmutchkin; but as they founded their opposition upon dissent from "the Glenmutchkin system" generally, the committee allowed them to be heard. We fought for three weeks Xa most desperate battle, and might in the end have been victorious, had not our last antagonist, at the very close of his case, pointed out no less than seventy-three fatal   o A It mU1be ourog as Jarm.   283 errors in the parliamentary plan deposited by the unfortu- nate Solder. Why this was not done earlier, I never ex- actly understood; it may be, that our opponents, with gentle- manly consideration, were unwilling to curtail our-sojourn in London-and their own. The drama was now finally closed, and after all preliminary expenses were paid, sixpence per share was returned to the holders uponr the surrender of their scrip. Such is an accurate history of the Origin, Rise, Progress, and Fall of the Direct Glenmutchkin Railway. It contains a deep moral, if anybody has sense enough to see it; if not, I have a new project in my eye for the next season, of which timely notice shall be giveh.  &#xD;<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7943-00000142"/> Miss Brightington's Polka Jacket; OR, SUSAN BENNETT'S CHRISTMAS-DAY. oTHER, there's only Mrs. MacDingaway's plaid cotton-velVet dress to finish, and the young lady her companion's tartan muslin to make, and Miss Brightington's blue body to sew on," said Susan Bennett, a pretty little dressmaker, who had just set up in the aristocratic suburb of Islington. "I shall get finished -by Christmas-Eve," she added, "and shall have time to make you the new cap, and put the flounce upon my brown merino." Alas! for the vanity of human expectation. Napoleon foresaw not the frost and snow of Russia; and Susan Ben- nett did not know the colder elements of, envy and selfish- ness that were to chill her heart on Christmas-Day. The eve came, and, basket in hand, the little dressmaker trip- ped along. The ponderous velvet, of- vast dimensions, and the freezing muslin, were safely delivered; and now came the delicate blue silk, for the only daughter and sole heiress of a retired stockbroker, but one who would not give her a         .                   .   Mis sriotinhgton's VARte ach    285 guinea for dower while he lived. Here Susan was desired to walk in; and then she was told to walk up into the snug and comfortable dressing-room of that elderly young lady, for Miss Brightington was thirty, or thereabouts. Not that we would hint that there is any impeachment of the moral character in being thirty, or that it is even a legal crime, which might be quite another thing, or even that parties acknowledging such a fact are amenable to any obsolete law; but, unhappily, Miss Brightington made herself ridiculous by behaving a la seventeen,' and was afflicted with a short- ness of memory quite deplorable. She couldn't remem- ber the queen's accession-not a bit-and had only a vague idea of being taken to see the illuminations on the auspi- cious event of her majesty's marriage:- adding of course, that " children always like such things." Miss Brightington also ascended into the warm dressing- room, ant, combining the expression of an injured indi- vidual with as much dignity as was compatible with the feet-upon-fender-and-fire-screen-in-hand attitude adopted, she spoke to the trembling Susan, who saw that something was wrong, but couldn't tell what, seeing that the new dress was yet to be tried, and she did believe it would fit "beau- tifully. ' ' I could not have believed such a thing," said the lady, taking the dress in her hand with something very like a snatch. (N. B. To snatch is not dignified.) "What have I done wrong, ma'am?"   said Susan, meekly; "I have made it. exactly as you ordered." "As Hordered, indeed! But haven't you made that Miss Clatterworth's green satin with a POLKA JACKET?" Susan admitted the fact. "And she to dine here to-morrow! Do you suppose I'll wear this thing?"And the irate lady threw the dress from her.  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7943-00000143"/> 286      .   n istmas *ifritr. "I think it looks so nice, ma'am," said Susan, holding it out in the most attractive manner; "and it's just the make you thought so becoming." "Thought--three months ago! I tell you what'it is, you must take it back, and make me a Polka Jacket by five o'clock to-morrow." "It's Christmas-Day!" exclaimed the now tearful dress- maker. "Well, I know it is. I want it for the Christmas party. No harm in working, I am sure, if there is no harm in play- ing forfeits, and all that." -"I must make quite a new body-I must sit up all night to do it." "Oh, nonsense! you people always say that." "If you would let it be till next week--" urged Susan, timidly. "If you won't do it, somebody else will," returned the lady; and assuming the air of a patroness, she continued- "I did think, after all I had done for you, I should have met with a little gratitude! but there's no such thing in the world, I believe." And doubtless she spoke from personal experience. Poor simple-hearted Susan was quite overpowered by the charge of ingratitude: and not clearly understanding that all she had to be grateful to Miss Brightington for was, being allowed to work for her cheaper and better than that distinguished individual could find any one else to do, she would at that moment have consented to make polka jack- ets for a hundred days and nights to escape from it. Now poor little Susan had a thorough woman's heart. Not one, however, a bit like that of a fashionable belle, with all its glow and glory worn off by countless flirtations. Nor did she a bit resemble the class of " strong-minded " women who despise 'dress and all such appurtenances, who   giK  ^tingtong'n ialkwa achet.   287 wouldn't be handsome if they could-not they--and who yet feel a natural antipathy to those afflicted with the gift of beauty, albeit so despised by them. For ourselves, we would not give a pin for a woman who had not just enough of a natural kind of a fascinating desire to please, which teach- es her how to put on a shawl or a bonnet in the most effective manner. Now Susan Bennett had precisely the right quantity of this feminine talent; and it was not only the flounce to her own dress that she wanted to prepare against the coming day--there were half-a dozen et-ceteras of the toilet that seemed urgent necessities, ere she could appear at a certain Christmas party, which she had look- ed forward -to, with the eagerness of those who taste few pleasures, for many a week. Who could it be before whom she wished to appear charming? Not surely her grandmother, who, by the way, was yet young enough to make a plum-pudding, and enjoy the same; not her uncles and aunts, and the juvenile sprouts whose numbers seemed legion. Though if she had been asked to make out a list of the Christmas guests expect- ed to meet at uncle Tom's, the chances are she would have left out a certain merry-hearted young watchmaker, who always said "everything was for the best"--or at any rate she would have named him last, with a sort of "Oh, I forgot cousin Robert." The little dressmaker had talked of sitting up all night; but there came a recollection of red eyes and pale cheeks, consequent upon such freaks, so to bed she went, meaning to rise at four in the morning. But alas'! she could not sleep, or if for a moment she lost consciousness, she dreamt .. of cousin Robert making love to somebody in a horrible Polka Ja ket. So up she rose on the bitter Christmas morn- ing at three of the clock, and kindled a few cinders to  &#xD;<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7943-00000144"/> 288        (rtliwlas tofie. keep her from quite shivering, and by the light of a thin candle set about her task. We wonder what Miss Arabella Brightington was dream- ing of just then. The tabby cat rubbed against Susan's foot, as if ask- ing for a saucer of milk; she- was used to a candle-light breakfast sometimes, and did not know the hour. But she must wait as well as her mistress-no milk in the streets yet'for hours. See, daylight is breaking! And hark! there's a shrill young voice pouring out a Christmas carol. Foolish Susan, the tears are dropping upon your work- what is the reason -not that merry carol surely? Do tears stain blue silk? We cannot positively tell; but judging from circumstan- tial evidence should say not. At any rate, she dashes them away because--she has not time to fret. The mother must make her own cap, that's certain; and finely she fusses about it. Susan shows her how, and might almost as well have done it entirely. Noon comes; no chance of the flounce on her own gown -that hope is abandoned entirely. Thread breaks, needles snap, and pins drop out in the most rebellious manner ima- ginable. .Susan is getting nervous, her fingers tremble, and she sees, with prophetic truth, she must give up also going to three o'clock dinner; this is worse than giving up the flounce, but there's no help for it-the polka Jacket cannot be done. The mother talks of staying at home, also; but as Susan justly says, "What's the use of that, especially as there's no dinner provided? She will have bread and cheese, and come to tea; sure to have some supper at uncle Tom's on Christmas-Day." The mother yields, though not without some kindly regrets, to such potent reasonings--and the little dress   two  itginitou'a olaef.      289 maker is left to her Christmas dinner of bread and cheese --and to work at the polka jacket. Once she goes to the window to see how the world looks outside. Flys and coaches rattle along; brisk pedestrians are smartly dressed; omnibuses look gayer than usual; and a remarkably bright fire -shines from the opposite house. Silly Susan-tears again! they only hinder your work, and will make your eyes quite as red as a wakeful night would do. Four o'clock! The polka jacket, with its pipings, and linings, and buttons, completed at last. Half a mile to be carried home, but the little dressmaker almost flies that -and, extravagant creature, spends sixpence to ride back by omnibus-which crawls the distance. Miss Brightington glorified in the polka jacket, espe- cially as her rival did not wear hers; so that, after all, she might have spared poor Susan, without suffering very cruelly for it. Just as she was sitting down to three cour- ses, Susan Bennett was making her toilet, to join the Christ- mas party at tea. The brown mering would really do very well without a flounce, and she had contrived to sew a bit of lace on the top, that being one of the most important of the et-ceteras. She is locking the doors of the two rooms she and her mother occupy, but is so startled by a loud knock that the key drops out of her hand! Who can it be? Somebody opens the door and the wind almost blows out Susan's candle, but it does not quite, and she sees by the flickering light that cousin- Robert springs two steps at a time up the stairs. For that matter, though, she knew his step without staying to look who it was. "How kind of you to come for me! , exclaimed Susan. "Theywouldn't let me come before-at least they be- gan laughing and quizzing.  I hate to be quizzed-don't you?" ( Yes," murmured Susan, in the faintest of treble notes; 13  /   &#xD;<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC7943-00000145"/> 290  -tima*s 0x^to       . but somehow or other her cousin heard the word, and by this time they were out in the street, "How cold it is!" said Robert. "Yes, no; yes, it is cold." ' Cold! why your hand is like ice; there, wrap the other ina-your cloak: I'll keep this warm." "Robert! let go, what nonsense!" "I will, I say ;' but the remainder of that conference is sacred. "What a time you must have kept Robert!" said the grandmother, C She was not quite ready," he answered for her. True, she had the key to pick up and one door to lock, and- they had come a long way round. There was a little quizzing after the cousins arrived, but they did not seem to mind it much. People don't when they have a thorough understanding between themselves. Though Susan had had no dinner she ate very little sup- per, and yet she could not be ill-she had such a beautiful color: but that might be from her long walk. Certainly, nobody would have thought she had sat up half the night, and been weeping half the morning. Cousin Robert, not- withstanding his gaiety, had always been a bit of a philoso- pher;- he said the works of the clocks and watches made himn think, and, as we have said before, his favorite maxim was " all is for the best." He is going into business for him- self-very soon;- but he must have told Susan something more than that in their long walk, or she never would have agreed with him that it was " all for the best " that she had to stay at home and make Miss Brightington's -PoLa JAC=T.   ;'                 1 ffi    , Christmas-Eve in a Sponging-House. 4 4 c OU promise to come home early, father?, said my eldest-born, Tony. "At five, my boy. 'Come! my umbrella.?2 "Huzza, Mary! Father will be home at five, and I'm to ask Tommy Davidson and Julia Stevens, to come in after tea and play at snapdragon, because it's Christmas-Eve." As I stepped into the street, and closed the door behind me, I felt how rich I was, possessing, as I did, wife and children, whose love made them hail my presence as a bless. ing. The morning was anything but agreeable; a heavy mist fell upon the ground, covering the pavements with a mass of glutinous mud, that rendered walking difficult. Nevertheles, I felt it not; I saw but the merry faces of my darlings clustering round the table, and heard only their joyous voices iterating my name. The office where I was engaged was in the city and I had so far satisfied my employers during two years' servi. tude, that my salary had been nearly doubled without any solicitation on my part; I did not owe a shilling-as I thought-and I  looked forward to a very merry Christmas,  &#xD;<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC7943-00000146"/> 292        Xrimw   orie. and a happy New Year. I had just passed the Angel at Tslington, when a young gentleman, in a very shabby til- bury, saluted me with-"Hi! Mister!" and to my surprise pulled up his horse and descended from -his vehicle. The young gentleman was no common personage. There was a violent attempt to smother a native vulgarity under a "genteel" wardrobe. The tailor had done his duty, but Nature was stronger than Art, and the wearers low-life showed through the mass of velvet' and broadcloth, and gave a brassy appearance to the massive Mosaic chains and rings which encumbered the vest and fingers of the stranger. "Your name's Joseph Gardner, isn't it, Mister?" said the gentleman. I answered in the affirmative. "Then you'll be good enough to get in my gig, 'cos I wants you." "Want me, sir? I don't understand you." "Few folks does at first," said the gentleman; "but then I always carries that as satisfies 'em afore long. There's a copy, and here's the original;" presenting me with a slip of paper, and exhibiting a parchment exactly similar in appearance. I glanced at the paper, and saw my name, and the Queen's, and John Doe's, all jumbled together. John Doe was enough. I guessed something was wrong, and at- tempted to stammer out an inquiry, but the words stuck in my throat. "Why,-why--this is--" "An execution," said the young gentleman; "you're now in the custody of the sheriff of Middlesex." "What for! I don't owe a shilling., "Ha! ha! ha! That's very odd, that is. You're the fourth caption I've made this morning, and not one on 'em owed a farthing. I don't know how it is, but people like you must be very ill used. You're at the suit of Dibbins, you are," said the gentleman. "Dibbins! Dibbins! I don't know such a name."   #rdmahs-/Et in a Songig-omIse.   293 "And yet it aint such a common 'un as you'd be likely to forget it. But I must trouble you to get in." I looked at the gentleman, and saw by the composure of his manner that I was in his power. To resist would have been to provoke exposure. "I trust, sir," said I, "that you will allow me to return to my family, and apprise them of my situation., "Why, writing will do as well. You'll have every accommodation at father's," replied the gentleman, pointing with the butt-end of his whip to a seat in his tilbury, Which a very dirty fellow had just vacated. "But my wife, sir, will , "Now, pray don't do the sentiment, sir. Ours is bad enough without having  our feelings harrowed. Davis, you'll catch that old one to-night in Brook street; he's sure to come home for his pudden to-morrow. Now, sir, if con- venient." I obeyed, as he continued-"You see this is a busy day with us-that's a rum title for a pantomime they've got at the Lane (nodding his head at a huge posting-bill on a boarding) ; but you see, if you let things stand over till the turn of the year, chaps manage to settle, and then--wot's to become   of us? Live and let live, eh! Mister ;" and with such pleasant remarks did he beguile away the time' until we arrived at Mr. Jacobs's residence in N street, ("Here we arrive," said the gentleman; " it don't look so bad as you thought it would, eh! Mister? , I should have lied if I had said it did not; for that house, like a branded man among his fellows, was made horribly conspicuous by dirt and bars. There were other houses to'the right and to the left that seemed the dwellings of men, but that one stood out an isolated blot-a thing which the plague-cross could not have made more dreadful.

I trembled as the porter turned the key of the huge, lock which secured an inner door in a dark passage, and I felt my face crimson as I entered what my gentleman designated the " coffee-room." Oh! that " coffee-room"- what a mockery! True, there were four boxes with cur- tains and tables-dirty-filthy dirty. The windows looked ---into a small paved yard, barred at the top like a cage; yes, it was literally a cage, where man penned up his fellow like a wild beast, barring him from all the good gifts of God, making his poverty and his misfortunes a hundred times more bitter, by thus assimilating their consequences to those of reckless crime. I thought my heart would have burst with the weight of those bars, for I was physically sensible of their pressure. "I cannot bear this! a"I exclaimed. "Tell me, sir, why you have brought me here." The gentleman held out the slip of parchment. :"I know no one of that name," I said. "Can you- will you be more explicit?" The fellow smiled. "Lor, how you go on; you'll think nothing of it to-morrow. Will he, captain?" "No, no--nothing when he is used to it," answered a tall gentlemanly man in a plaid dressing-gown. Until then I had thought we were alone. I sank down upon a bench almost breathless. Mr. Jacobs regarded me for a few moments with an expression of contempt at my weakness, and then pointing to a name on another slip of parchment, said, "Do you know him?" John Knight! my old and trusted friend, John Knight I I understood it all. I had accepted a bill for John, and the rascal had betrayed my confidence in his honor! 601.! I knew that it had saved him from ruin, and thkis was the   (Sdtmatn^fe in a iSyowyg-gouse.  295 return he made me. I never cursed a living thing till then, but I did curse John Knight, and bitterly have I repented of the sin.  What was to be done? I had not a friend in London, except my employers, and I feared to acquaint them with my position. I had not more than 101. in the world, and that was in the savings' bank. I rang the bell and ordered a sheet of paper. The boy who brought it to me was a diminutive ditto of my captor-the same sinister look-the same sneering tone. "Sixpence, Mister." . "Sixpence! for what?" "The paper, and pen and ink, s'il voes plait." I paid the money, and would have given double to have freed myself from the presence of that boy. I began a letter to my wife, but, as I wrote, the paper became covered with the faces of my children, and I could not proceed-I could only weep. I think an hour must have passed before I resumed my letter. I finished it, I know not how, and then rang the bell for a messenger. That boy in years--that man in cunning-again made his appearance. "Well, Mister?'9 "Can I have this letter taken to my house?" "Oui, Monsieur," said the imp, "certainement.  "Then let it be sent off'immnediately. "Hallo!" exclaimed the boy, with a grin, " you under- stand French!  Will you give us a lesson if I bring a book in presently?  I know a good bit, which I've got ' Cap- tions' to teach me." "Capital!" exclaimed the captain, "that's learning French without a master!" --As costs anything," said the boy, with a wink; "I  &#xD;<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC7943-00000148"/> 296         atrima tzxiw. got the alphabet from an old chap as took Scotch snuff, and died in the Fleet; and the first conjugation from a banker's clerk that lost his place 'cos we wouldn't let him out till he'd paid his bill-hal ha! I went to take him, I did," added the imp, with a fiendish chuckle. "You!"The announcement evidently surprised Cap- tain Cool. "Yes! Mo let me go as a treat-and it was one too- it was at Pentonville. ' We've got him,' said Mo. ' How do you know?' said I; and then Mo laughed, and showed me a cobweb that a spider had spun in the night from the door-post to the key-hole-ha! ha! We had him safe enough at 20 minutes to 9." "You will give us a lesson, won't you, Mister?" con- tinued the boy, addressing me. I cannot recollect my reply, but I remember that it gave the lad great offence for a few moments. The captain, however, restored him to good-humor, and then desired him to see that my letter was forwarded. "' Well, where's the half crown?" said the boy-" hallo!" holding the letter at arm's length, "Islington, is it? three and six." Again I submitted to imposition, for I had not the power -to dispute. I sat down moodily by the fire, and thought what a scoundrel was Jack Knight, and what I would say to him when freed from the filthy den of Mr. Jacobs. My fellow-prisoner was not so gravely disposed. He began to hum, "Here's a health to all good lasses," and was doubtless recalling some Bacchanalian orgie of other days. At length he grew weary of his own music, and after a pause said, without turning- his face from the window, "Nasty-very nasty day, sir." With some effort I replied, "Yes, sir."   ^ritmas-dfte in a igpongngz^otM . '397 "Drizzly," continued the captain; "drizzly, a very unpleasant day to be out." Had the thunder crackled, and the clouds rained tor- rents, I would have walked forth bare-headed to have been at liberty. Perceiving that I was indisposed to converse, the captain relapsed into his musical reminiscences, and I resumed my melancholy reflections. At last an involuntary exclamation escaped from my lips--"That I should spend a Christmas Day in this place!" I shall never forget the remark which that exclama- tion, uttered in the bitterness of my soul, elicited from the captain. "Sir," said he, with a solemnity of tone which I mistook for sympathy, " sir, I'll defy any one to make a better pud- ding than mother Jacobs. I've eaten many of them." Where was the use of caging such a man? Hour after hour passed, and yet my wife came not. Was she overpowered by the knowledge of my position? I should have been more cautious in communicating it. Had some accident befallen her on her way to me? It might be thus, and I could not know the truth. The chil- dren; then I could only weep again. I sat and dreamed a thousand fancies, until the entrance of a new coiner roused me.   He bowed as he entered the room;  and without speaking a word sat down on one of the boxes and com- menced making calculations in his pocket-book. -After some minutes had elapsed, he muttered, "The villain! 20001.; if they don't take him I am ruined." "Numbers of people ruined just now," said the captain. "Yes, yes," answered the man;   "but few by such treachery as makes me a beggar."  "Dear me!" exclaimed the captain; "may I ask how you have been done?" 13*  &#xD;<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7943-00000149"/> 298        datnumag itiiR* "By my partner," answered the man, fiercely t "he has absconded with nearly 2000/." "No more-bolted for that!" "No more!" exclaimed the trader. "It was our all- but he knows what I have sworn. I am sure he knows it!" and he paced the room rapidly. "Ha! ha!" said the captain; " what, you'll towel him, eh? take it out in battery?" "No: I'll do more than that. I can't have made a mistake," continued he, seating himself, and resuming his calculation. The clock struck nine-no wife! Had the messenger played false, and not taken the letter? Ah! there's a knock. No! it was a man's voice. As I turned from the door, my eyes fell on the face of the new comer; I never saw such an expression of demoniacal joy in my life. The door opened, and a tall haggard young man entered the room. There was no mistaking who he was--the partners were together! Not a word was spoken, but they fixed their eyes upon each other: the one with an expression of devilish triumph- the other with that of abject fear. Ten-eleven o'clock, and no wife. My anxietyioecame agonizing. The hour for retiring to bed arrived, and the captain volunteered to act as groom of the chamber. As I was entering the sleeping apartment, I felt my arm clutched violently, and on turning round found I was held by the tallest of the new comers. "For heaven's sake, sir, tell me, are we all to sleep in the same room?" "It appears so," I replied. "I will not trust myself in the same room with that man: he has sworn to be my death, and I will not lie down where he is." The poor wretch shook with terror.   4fispma-jbb i'n a ganging-goutt,  299 "Be easy," said the captain, who had overheard him; "I have a private room, ha! ha! a cupboard; that's at your service; there's no bolt, but I'll tell you how to fasten it with the bootjack.," The man seemed to be relieved by this whimsical pro- mise of security, and entered the sleeping-room. The door was closed, and the bolt of the huge lock shot heayily home. The sound produced an utter silence in the room; then came a rushing noise, and the partners were rolling and struggling upon the floor. The contest was frightful. Oaths and revilings were uttered loudly and fiercely, and it was some time before the captain and my-, self could separate the infuriated men. And this was Christmas-Eve! As the captain conducted the taller combatant to his 'cupboard," I heard my name called from the bottom of the stairs. "Mr. Gardner! Come down, sir, will you?" I descended, and saw my wife and-John Knight. My poor girl threw herself on my neck, and cried heartily. John Knight spoke as though his throat were full of tears. "Joe, this is not my fault," said John; " my lawyer had the money a month ag6. I've settled all-but my grati- tude. Do you forgive me?" At twelve o'clock on Christmas-Eve, John and I drank a merry Christmas and -a happy New Year to each other; and as the clock struck one, the children came down stairs in their night-gowns to have the game of snap-dragon which I had promised them. .   &#xD;<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7943-00000150"/> yself and      Julia Arran. AT was so dark when I got into the Oxford coach in Piccadilly, that I could not see whether I had a fellow-traveller or not. Something or other there certainly was in the opposite corner, but the unsteady flicker- ing of the lights did not enable me to discover whether the heap so closely huddled up contained only carpet-bags and greatcoats,-or a bundle of human nature. With a view of certifying myself on this point, I made some observations which, if the being had been human, would have elicited an answer. As no reply, however, was made, I used no fur- ther ceremony, but seizing what I now thought was only some luggage, I tried to throw it to the bottom of the coach, to make room for my legs on the opposite side. The resistance offered to this attempt showed me that I had been mistaken in my conjecture. Yet the resistance was only that of weight. There was no activity in the opposi- tion, and as the silence continued unbroken, I began to be haunted by horrid recollections of the stories I had heard, of corpses being conveyed from place to plwe in the dis- guise of travellers. The darkness of the night, the lateness   grdf ant alia grmia.       o 301 of the hour, were evidently the fittest that could be chosen for the purpose, and ere we had reached Knightsbridge Bar- racks (for all this had happened within a few minutes of my entering the coach), I had fully persuaded myself that I was sitting in the very closest proximity to a dead man. I fancied, in the horrid darkness, the ghastly face that was now so near to mine, and in fact I had made up my mind, cold and dreary as the night was, to take possession of an out- side seat on the very first opportunity. It is all very well to laugh at such feelings as these when you hear them describe ed by the side of a comfortable fire, your feet on the fen- der, and your friend just passing to you the " buz" of the first bottle; it is a very different matter, I assure you, when fantasies of that kind take possession of you in cold and soli- tude at the witching hour. I would have changed places with an icicle, to have got away from my hideous compa- nion, and it was only- shame, and a fear of the world's dread laugh (the world at that time consisting of the guard and coachman) which prevented me from   stopping the coach, and changing my situation on the instant. As I  sat im- mersed in these not very agreeable contemplations, some- thing, by a sudden lurch of the coach, fell heavily on my knee. In the hurry of the surprise I uttered a sort of shout, and was on the point of bolting out of the window, making no doubt that my worst fears were realized, and that my dreadful fellow-traveller had partly broken loose from his fastenings, and was- actually reclining on my leg. - I feared to put out my hand in case of coming in contact with his ghastly skin, and might perhaps have worked myself into a state of -insanity altogether, if the object of my apprehen- sions had mot suddenly squeaked out in a voice inexpressibly shrill and startling--"London fairly behind us at last. May I ask, sir, what the devil you meant by shaking me so fero- ciously a  short time ago?"  &#xD;<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC7943-00000151"/> 302        *lriaats .to 'Sir!"I cried, in the extremity of my surprise;- "shake, sir; what do you mean?" "What do I mean, sir? I mean to say it is unaccoun- table behavior in any gentleman to pull another gentleman nearly off his seat the moment he enters a coach. I have a theory, sir" "I assure you, sir, from the darkness and your obstinate silence, I wasn't aware that I had a companion." "Silence, sir?-To be sure I was silent. No man ought to speak on the stones. I have a theory that any man who speaks to another till the vehicle has reached Kensington, is a man of the very feeblest understanding." "You are not inclined to be very polite, I perceive, sir." "Not much temptation -to politeness, sir, when the very first thing a man does is to shake me as if I had been a carpet." "Why, to tell you the truth, I thought you were a carpet-bag, which is much the same thing; but as I was the aggressor, will you allow me to apologize to you for my mistake, and wish you a very good night, as I shall sleep till the coach reaches Oxford." "By no means-by no sort of manner of means what- soever," replied my companion; " if it weren't so confound- edly dark, I would shake hands with you this moment, to, show that I bear no malice; but as to the idea of sleeping, it is one of the most ridiculous fancies I ever heard of-- sleep, indeed, when I am in the coach with you! I have a theory, sir" "Really, sir, you don't talk of my ideas with much re- spect."  "Why should I?  Ideas-I don't believe you have one. What is it like? Is it blue, or green, or grey, sir? I should like very much to see a real bona fide idea. Has it a tail, sir?"   nguialf MrRu brig tTxan,    303 "No-but it has a finger and thumb, which at this moment have a strong inclination to pull an impertinent fellow's nose." "Meaning me? Oh, Plato! Oh, Aristotle! that ever I should live to be called an impertinent fellow-but I am not angry; no, not in the least, so don't be alarmed: I have a theory, sir, that people can't see each other very distinctly in the dark." "So I have heard, sir "- "Which fully accounts for your applying such an epi- thet to me." "They can hear each other in the dark, though." "Ah, that's quite another thing. Now, if you were to hear my name, how you would be surprised! It almost makes me laugh to think of your confusion; but 'twould be rather too severe." "You are very considerate,"' I said. "Oh, if you brave me to it, I shall certainly mention my name, and cover you with shame and confusion of face." "'Tis lucky for me that, according to your very original theory, the darkness will render my blushes invisible.', "Well,- sir, you will remember you first of all shook me." "Well, sir?" "Next you threatened to pull my nose." "Well, sir?"     . "And next you called me an impertinent fellow. You remember all this, sir?" "Yes."              "Well then, sir; know that all this has been done to Dr. Oliver Olynthus Flopp, one of the senior fellows of St. John's, author of the Theory of Reciprocities and Dis- agreements.

"I'll tell you what it is, Dr. Flopp, or whatever name you rejoice in, if you are not a little more guarded in your language, I shall most undoubtedly kick you out of this coach." "Gracious heaven! worse and worse. Young man, you are heaping up for yourself a store of the most bitter repentance. How will it look in after ages that the author of the Theories was threatened with such unheard-of indig- nities by a nameless traveller in a stage-coach? You will certainly commit suicide if I mention it in the preface to the next edition. I have a theory that suicide" "Is not half so pleasant an amusement as murder; so I advise you to mind what you say." "Sir! do you know who I am, sir?" "You have just told me you are one of the fellows of St. John's, and a more conceited, insolent, impertinent fel- low it is impossible to imagine. I never heard your cursed name before."  ,' Nor my book, sir?" ( No, nor your book." "Dear me, how foolish! just tell me your address, and Talboys shall send it you directly. Two pound twelve; you can get some friend in the university to advance the money. How I envy you the first reading!" "I wouldn't read a word of it to save your miserable body from the gallows." '"Are you serious, sir, in saying that?" "Quite serious, I assure you." "Then there must-be something more in this than meets   jgalf anth Talia gtran.     305 the ear. There must be some secret, inscrutable instinct of antipathy, that makes your mind start in one moment into an antagonism to mine. What can it be? It will be a delightful exercise till we reach the city of palaces to find it out.". "To find out what, sir?" "Why, the cause of your not liking me." "It doesn't, surely, need much sagacity to discover that. You are one of the rudest, most repulsive indivi- duals, I ever met." "That's just the very thing; but why am I repulsive? Did your grandfather ever quarrel with any ancestor of mine, sir?" "How should I know?" "Or your father-do I know him, sir?" "I don't know." "Or your mother-perhaps I have been cruel to her in her maiden state? I may, perhaps, have led her to expect further results-for foolish women, I have often remarked, appreciate rather too highly the slightest attentions of handsome and celebrated men." "By Heavens, sir-I have borne your insolence long enough." "Or, perhaps, it may be in the future? Have our genii crossed each other before, or are they doomed to meet at Philippi? Some innate sympathy of antipathy there must undoubtedly be, for, I confess to you, from the moment you entered the coach, I felt perfectly certain you would turn out a very disagreeable companion." "Go on, sir," I said, now fairly enraged at his imperti- nence. "But confound me if I don't call you to an account for your excessively presumptuous and ungentlemanly be- havior." "How, sir?

By-the-by, you have not given me your address yet." "I shall send it to you by a friend." ' Oh, let him give it to Talboys." "Who is Talboys, sir?" "Why, the publisher, to be sure, of my Theories. He will send you as many copies as you like. But enough of this. Let us try to find out why we hate each other. Were you ever at Southampton, sir?" "Yes-often." ,c Lately, sir?"            . "Yes." "Do you know Mrs. General Arran of Hetherton?" "By sight only," I said, getting more interested in my companion's questions. "And her two daughters, sir? '" "Very slightly." "Aren't they lovely, sir?  Which do you think the most beautiful?" I had my own notions, as you well know, upon this sub- ject; but, as I did not feel myself called on to make Dr. Oliver Olynthus Flopp my confidant, I answered as caval lierly as I could- "They are both tolerably good-looking i I don't know which I prefer."           i "That's it--that's the secret spring, you may depend on't. No wonder I hated you the moment you came into the coach.,  "How, sir?" said I, softening my tone, and anxious to pick up all the information I could--"I don't see what con-   g^tlf Imib Nm gmn.       507 nexion there is between your dislike to me and the com- parative beauty of the two young ladies." "But I do, though. Look at mybook-the chapter of Affinities, third volume, page three hundred and two-that's all." "Well, sir, I will look at your book." "Will you?-eh?-ah, let me see-I didn't say I hated you at first sight, did I?" "No, not actually hated, but something very like it. You said you strongly disliked." "Quite different these two, I assure you, One is active -to hate; the other is only negative--to dislike. That -distinction is very clearly established in the second volume -near the middle of the volume you will see it--about page two hundred and "-- -"But about the ladies, sir. Do you know them?" "To be sure I do.-I am their guardian.-The General was quite a philosopher. Pity he died before I took to metaphysics." That accounts, however, thought I, for his having left you the guardianship of his family. "Are you going to Hetherton now, sir?" said I. ' Aha! what business is that of yours? I consider the question excessively impudent. Why do you wish to know?" "Merely that I may have some idea of when I am to get rid of so pragmatical a coxcomb as Dr. Oliver Olynthus Slop." "Slop I stop,--'tis Flopp, sir 1" "Well, I mean you, whatever name-you rejoice in." "Heavens! me, sir? I've a theory"--- "Out with it.'

"Gracious powers  I wish I were six feet high. I would throttle you on the spot, sir!" "Well, sir, I have the advantage of being exactly the height you mention. What is to hinder me from squeezing you into a mummy?" "Here, guard I coachman! open the door. Thank goodness, here is High Wickham. Bring a lantern here. Let me see who this inhuman monster is." Saying this, he took the lantern out of the hostler's hand, and was going to hold it up to my face; but, by a dexterous kick, I smashed the frail utensil in pieces, sending a portion of the burning wick into the mouth of the now outrageous doctor. "Prr--prr--phaugh ;- this to a D C.L.!-this to a senior fellow! You rascal, I will make you smart for this. There will certainly be a blister on my lip-and Julia to be in Ox- ford on'Tuesday." e The very transient illumination had given me only one glimpse of my companion's appearance. He was muffled up in an indescribable number of greatcoats; and I only de- tected two very brisk, shining, little eyes, and a mouth of almost preternatural width, before the darkness became again so visible, that nothing else was to be seen. His last exclamation about Julia enraged me more than all. That a fellow such as that should venture, with such lips-redolent too at that very moment of the smoke and tallow of at stable lantern-to profane the name of Julia Arran I I rejoiced exceedingly that I had had so many op- portunities of mortifying the presumptuous wretch; and resolved to worry and todse him to the end of the journey. I also made sundry wise resolutions to keep myself strictly   ilgelf mtri :ula' Truan.    309 incog. In this I was rendered perfectly successful by the Cimmerian darkness of the night, and by the bustle that occurred on our arrival at Oxford; I sprang from the poach the moment we pulled up at the Mitre-seized my travelling case with my own hands, and had secured my bedroom almost before the bewildered metaphysician was fully aware of our arrival. As I was following the cham- bermaid up the second staircase, I heard the Doctor's voice upon the landing. "I declare to you, Mrs. Peake, you have an incendiary in your house; a villain who travelled with me from Lon- don ;-a murderer"---- "Sir!" said a lady's voice in reply;-" a murderer-an incendiary. You can't be serious, sir?" "Oh yes; but I am though;--a rascal. Would you believe it, Mrs. Peake?-He had never heard either of me or my book."  "But why do you think him a murderer,- sir?" "Haven't I told you, Mrs. Peake;--haven't I described to you that he was ignorant of the theories ;--and even when I told him who I was, what do you think he did, ma'am?" "I really can't say, sir." "Why, he pretended to mistake my name, and called me Slop!-- He'did, indeed. But here, Boots, take up my luggage and follow me to St. John's. Dr. Flopp's rooms, number six, second stair in- the inner Quad.-How I hate that infernal scoundrel!"And exchanging adieus with the landlady, and muttering curses on me, the philosopher pur- sued his way. The Undergraduate world is so separated by the eti- quette of Oxford from the dignitaries of the University, that though I had only two years before this incident ceased to be a denizen of the place, I had never so much as heard  &#xD;<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7943-00000155"/> of so distinguished a character as Dr. Flopp. His person was totally unknown to me, but if I had been acquainted with him twenty years, it would have been impossible to have hated him more cordially than I did. H[is vanity, his impertinence, and above all his insufferable familiar pronunciation of the name of Julia, got entirely the better of my temper, and as I reflected on all the particulars of his conduct I only regretted I had not fulfilled the threats I had held out to him, and Burked him in the corner of the coach. "But with the morning cool reflection came." I began to be surprised at my vehemence of the preceding night, and I felt quite happy that I had left Dr. Flopp in the land of the living. I will not deny, at the same time, that I hugged myself on the recollection that I had kept him in ignorance of my name, for I made no doubt that had he known it, his malice would have tempted him to have painted me to his wards in no very favorable colors. My acquaintance with the Hetherton family had begun a few months before this time. When I succeeded to the Halford estate, you will remember'the house was in a very ruinous condition. My cousin, the last proprietor, though he resided in it till his death, had allowed it to go into such a state of disrepair, as rendered it unfit for the residence of any other person. The first thing I had to do was to make it habitable; and accordingly masons, carpenters, glaziers, and the whole tribe of house-makers and house-menders, began their tiresome and to all appearance their intermina- ble labors. When we had finished some part of the job-I think the floor of the drawing-room-I was resting one day on one of the benches, while the workmen had retired to the kitchen, such as it was, to their dinner. I heard voices in what is now the conservatory; and not knowing very well what else to do I continued where I was, and listened to what was said.   -t eigf anib lii Brnt.     3" W' That a beautiful place!"- said- a voie so sweet and sil- very, that T felt at once convinced it belonged to " a gentle maiden, fair and young." "How I wish it were mine?" "Fanny, my dear, you are very flippant, if not sinful- remember the tenth commandment, child, and hold up the skirt of your riding habit?." - There was a sort of nasal whiffle accompanying this, which, however, did not seem to have all the effect that was intended, for the young lady went on as gaily as before. ' I wonder when all these horrid preparations Will be ended. Mr. Neville is certain to live here, isn't he? He will give such a famous ball in honor of his new house, won't he, mamma-?" "Probably he will, child, for I fear he is devoted to the vanities of this wicked world." "Is, he? Oh, I am delighted to hear that. He'll be such a nice neighbor." Faannay, be less volatile. He is very young "Better still!-Is he married, mamma " "No!--he has only just left Oxford, where, I fear, he has left no very good reputation; as your excellent guardian informed me, he never heard of his name.'"

' And Julia's eighteen; how delightful it would be iPf but here something prevented me from hearing the conclusion of her sentence.; "Child, why will-'you talk so wildly? He is a dweller in the tents of sin, and none of my daughters, I hope, would waste a thought on sach a person." At this moment the lively'interlocutor bounded through the folding doors into the drawing-room. "Beautiful! beautiful! mamma," she exclaimed, "see what a glorious view of the river"'-but, suddenly observing  &#xD;<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC7943-00000156"/> 312   d ifma Stozie. me, she stopped short, blushed a whole rosary at once, and with a half curtsey, disappeared again into the conservatory. She was very lovely, with fair, animated features, and seemed little more than fourteen or fifteen. I now felt my situation rather awkward, and followed them with the intention of inviting them to see the improvements; but they had been too rapid for me, and all that I saw on get- ting to the door was two ladies cantering as hard as possible down the avenue, followed by a servant. I discovered by inquiries among the work-people, that these were Mrs. Arran and her daughter, and that they had very often ridden over to see the progress of the building. However, nothing more occurred at that time, and I returned to London to the domicile of my good old aunt in Harley street. I had always a room in her house kept for me, and as my hours were not quite so regular as those of her sedate establishment, I used to carry a private key, admit myself quietly at any hour I returned, and steal silently to my bedroom without awakening any of the family. The terms I lived on with the old lady were the easiest and pleasantest in the world. We never interfered with each other. Whether she was in town or not, her house was equally my home. We asked no questions, bnt came or went just as we pleased. The next time I ran down to Hampshire I was more fortunate in making an acquaintance with the ladies who had interested me so much before, or at least with one of them; for Mrs. Arran had almost entirely given up going out anywhere, and was particularly scrupulous, I suppose, in never turning her rides in the direction of so great a reprobate as she was pleased to consider me. One morn- ing, at a very narrow part of a retired lane, I encountered two ladies on horseback, and as I pulled with considerable difficulty to the side of the road to make way for them, my   1fgtdf alXb 1tti arratn.    313 horse became a little restive, turning round and occupying so much of the path that their further progress was im- peded. In the youngest of them I recognised the bright eyes and laughing features of Fanny Arran. As she pulled up her pony till my horse should become a little steadier, I saw that it was with the utmost difficulty she re- frained from giving way to the liveliness of her spirits. I made some sort of apology, which was accepted by the gay young creature in such a way as to encourage me to go on. I therefore pretended that the only way to settle the mat- ter quietly was to walk old Bayard part of the way along with them, and in a very short time I found myself laugh- ing and chatting as happy as possible with the two most beautiful creatures it had ever been my lot to encounter. "It is of no use, Mr. Neville," said the young fairy, " to pretend not to know you. I know you very well, and I must introduce myself and my sister to you in return. This is my sister, Julia-generally called Miss Arran-and I am little Fanny-generally called--what do you think I'm generally called, Mr. Neville?" '"An angel, of course," I replied, putting my hand on my heart, and bowing, d la Sir Charles Grandison. "Oh, no-but they generally knit their brows, by way of appearing very wise-and speak very slow, by way of being very solemn-and generally call me ' Fanny, child!' -Isn't that too bad?" An acquaintance thus-begun soon ripened into some- thing more. By a series of the most wonderful coinciden- ces, we happened to direct our rides to the same points almost every day; and, at the end of a fortnight, Julia Arran appeared to me the very fittest object for dreams and rhapsodies I had ever met with. At every visit to Halford after this, and they were neither few nor far be- tween, my admiration had increased, and I was on my- way "  &#xD;<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7943-00000157"/> 314  -      jitmi itoriaw into Hampshire to make my proposals in due form, .when I encountered Dr. Flopp in the way I have ,escribed. X* ,;A torrent of ,old recollections had rushed in upon me, when the blockhead informed me of his name. By some umaccountable vagary, General Arran had left him with the usual tyrannical powers intrusted to a guardian.. He was to be 'consultedi in everything-they, were not, of course, to marry without his consent; and when I heard him, dur- ing our journey; to 'Oxford, ,talk so familiarly, and, as it -appeared to me,. so fiondly -of Julia, it gave point to -sundry arch ,allusions of the ;playfil and mischievous Miss Fanny, ian which she insinuated that Julia, if she were ambitious, had a chance of being Mrs. Flopp. I ,felt quite Certain upon; this, point, that the discoverer of theories would rather-die at once, thanwgive his ward to a fellow who had shown such a noble contempt of him as I had done; but as it was not for Julia's fortune that I contemplated such an event,:I made my:min'd very easy on the subjecti so far as I was concerned, and resolved, all other parties consent- ing, to make myself happy in spite .of him.: All this time I had:,.ever had theihappiness-of :seeing the mother, partly owing to her ill health, and partly, to own the truth, from a disinclination I felt to intrude myself -on a lady who had not mentioned my name with the deference that I fancied it deserved.. We met-that is the two young ladies and H-in one of our accustomed haunts, and when we had met every day for about a fortnight, my story was plainly told; and, by the mirthful glance of Fanny, as well as the silence of Julia, I saw that I had not much to fear. In answer to my proposal to ride over and discover all the circumstances to Mrs. Arran, she told me that, unfortunately, on the very next day they were go'ing for a month to town to consult the mediciners on the state of the old lady's health, and   Egdst m. i bi. tarm,       3,15 that ail such agitating incidents as a personal interview ought to be postponed till their return. It was, however, arranged that the matter should be broken to her in the meantime, and Fanny promised to let me know the result as early as possible. When the business was thus so satis- factorily arranged, I bore the separation with. more com- posure than could have been expected. But my hopes were doomed to a miserable disappointment. A few days after they had left Hetherton for town, I received a very short note from Fanny, telling me that, on her mother's submitting my proposition to their guardian, he had most positively objected to it; ,hat bhe .had restricted Julia: to the house, and forbidden her to think of me for a moment! Here was a blow to my happiness; and I; began to -regret that I had behaved so outrageously in the coach, as there might have been a chance of mollifying the philosopher, if I had. not placed myself past all hope of forgiveness. But it was, of no use moping .and pining down? in Hamps hire. To London I was resolved to go, and I had :no doubt of speedily finding them out,: as the note, was dated Harley street. My aunt, I knew, had gone on a seakbathing ,ex- pedition .somewhere on the "coast, and I was almost glad, of it, as it- left me more free to pursue my inquiries. - - I- did not reach town till. about ten o'clock, a t/ night; and, as I knew I: had no chance of succeeding in my object that night, I strolled into one of-the- theatres instead, of going to the now-lonely ,house in Harley street. I forget what the play was, but whatever it was it had no attraction for me for more than an hour, and H adjourned to a tayern. in the neighborhood, to brood over my ,disappointments and a grilled fowl,- There was no one in the coffee-room when, I entered, butcwhen I had just commenced!rmy :opera- tions, my ears were saluted by a voice! so pompousand shrill that I recognised it at once as belonging tothhe learned  &#xD;<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7943-00000158"/> 316        linttm Stoes? Dr. Flopp. "Waiter," it said, " get me a grilled fowl and a pint of mulled port: I've a theory that these are two very good things after a comedy.1" -I looked at- him. But you have seen him, and I need scarcely describe his appear. ance. Very thin legs, slightly bent outwards, supporting a body of considerable size-large stiff frills sticking out about a foot before him, and extending from immediately under his chin to the lowest button of his waistcoat--his large staring eyes and prodigious mouth formed a tout ensemble, as Walter Scott says of Claverhouse, " such as limners dike Cruikshank) love to paint, and -ladies (who have a turn for the ridiculous) to look upon." , On seeing me, he waddled up to the table with the most smiling affability, and said: "Allow me, sir, though a stranger, to compliment you on the taste you have displayed in the selection of your viands." "' Yeth, thir," I replied, affecting a lisp, and sinking my voice to a whisper, as if-in the agonies of a severe cold; "'tith a very nithe thing, ith a thtewed fowl, and a glath of mulled wine." "Perhaps you will let me join you. You may have heard of me before. I am Dr. Flopp of Oxford. Waiter, a knife and fork. I will join my friend, Mr.-a--a--a--" "Thnook, thir, ith my name. Thamuel Thnook." u"  -My friend, Mr. Snook. Do you know, Mr. Snook, that I have a theory that there is a great similarity between our tastes. Have you studied the subject of Reciprocities and Disagreements? Take some wine, Mr. Snook." "No; I have never thtudied it" (but I need not go on spelling my lisps), " but I have heard that some dunder- headed fool has published some stupid things he calls Theo- ries on the subject." "Indeed! Do you happen to remember the author's   goldf Ra uliba n       317 name?  I have a theory you are no philosopher, Mr. Snook." ' No; I'm certainly no philosopher, but I have the good sense not to be idiot enough to pretend to be anything of the sort." "So I perceive--you've made a mistake, Mr. Snook- you have emptied my pint of porter." "No mistake, I assure you, sir. I have a theory on that subject myself." "The devil you have! I'll thank you to theorize on your own porter next time. I am as thirsty as a desert. Why, you have finished the fowl, Mr. Snook." "I bless Heaven I have a capital appetite-but here comes the one you have ordered-let me help you, sir." Saying this I seized possession of the dish, and cutting him off the two claws and the head, helped myself very deliberately to the remainder of the chicken. "Sir! What do mean, sir? Do you know who I am, sir? I wrote the Theories!" "Take some wine, sir." "No, sir, not a drop.'? I hold you to that," I said, and emptied the decanter at a draught. "Sir!" cried Dr. Flopp, spluttering and stammering in the extremity of his passion. "You are the most impudent impostor I ever encountered. I have a theory that beha- vior such as yours will conduct you to the gallows." "Sir, you are very polite," I lisped out in reply. "My family has been hanged for many generations." "Indeed! Well, that is wonderful. You'll not deny, Mr. Snook, that my Theories are almost uniformly correct. I had a secret intuitive perception of your fate the moment you opened your mouth.

"Fifty-eight! fifty-nine!" but before I had arrived at the fatal number, the Doctor had scuttled out of the room with the grace and animation of a hunted turtle. You will say this was very bad taste, and very bad generalship to boot; but the temptation to spite the fellow was so great, that it was impossible to resist it. It seemed to me to be paying him in a fictitious character for his malicious opposition to me in my own. Could such an individual as that really be serious in his admiration of Julia--my Julia! The thought, though now that one thinks of it calmly, it seems only fit to be laughed at, was at the moment so atrociously disgusting as to justify all the insults I'could heap on the entertainer of it. But after about an hour's serious cogitation over all the circumstances, I re- solved to make " a bold stroke for a wife," and call on them   AgoeIf ant xi0 I Arnm,     319 the moment I discovered where they lived. With this magnanimous resolution I left Covent Garden, and strolled quietly towards home. It was now, however, so late that I did not think it worth while to disturb the servants; so applying my private lkey I opened the main door, and slipped silently up the stairs to my well known dormitory on the second floor. It was pitch dark when I entered my bedroom, and not. knowing very well where to deposit my habiliments, I merely loosened my neck-cloth, hung my coat on the back' of a chair, and flung myself at a bound on the outside of my bed. With a scream of enormous agony some one struggled most actively under my weight, and spluttered out "Murder! murder!-ugh! ugh! What the devil! Who ate you?" The voice astonished me beyond measure. There was no mistaking it. "Dr. Flopp!"I said, in my natural voice-." what in Heaven's name are you doing in my bed?" "Your bed?  Get off, sir. You have forced the blanket into my mouth. Your bed? Who the deuce are you?" CDon't you remember me by my voice? We travelled together to Oxford." "Oh, Lord!: have mercy upon us! What have I done to deserve to be murdered in the flower of my age?" "Hush, sir, and answer-my questions. What are you doing in this house?"  "Doing? why, staying here with the Arrans." ("What! in this house!" "Yes 1 to be sure. Mrs. Allanson, the owner of it, has gone to the country for six weeks, and I engaged it for Mrs. Arran. And now may I ask what brought you here?"  &#xD;<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC7943-00000160"/> 320 o        xiimat Sitois. "Why, I'm engaged to marry Julia." "You! You that threatened to murder me in the coach, and I verily believe have followed me with that intention to this very spot. You! 'tis impossible." "What's impossible about it? I tell you, 'tis all fixed; and this I tell you also, that if you make the slightest oppo- sition to it, I'll dog you from place to place till I get you again as completely into my power as I have you now, and then--,'" "Oh, horrid! I have a theory that this is very disagree- able. What do you wish me to do, sir?" "To withdraw your opposition to my marrying Miss Julia." "Oh, heavens! how am I to get out of this? 'Tis im- possible, sir;-and now that I recollect, she is engaged already to another gentleman." "How? to another? who is he?" "To a most deserving young man--a Mr. Neville of Halford. Do you know him?" X"Yes," I replied, "I know him very well: and a -very excellent fellow he is, I assure you. I shall arrange matters with him, provided only that you leave us alone." "Call him out; shoot him by all means.   I've a theory" "Pooh! curse your theories. I shall neither call him out nor shoot him; but only this I tell you, that if you interfere any further in the matter, I'll make a vacancy in the fellowships of St. John's. Now I'm going to leave you --stir not, speak not.: If you ever mention this interview, you die to a certainty by my hand." "Oh gracious!-but, by the bye, did you speak to Tal- boys about the Theories? You'll find them  delightful reading. I have a new Theo" "Hush!"   #t0elf anb Jula ia tanl.    321 I gently opened the door, groped my way into the library, and depositing myself on a sofa, made up my plans for the morrow. Could anything be so fortunate as the ac- cident of their having settled themselves in the. very house of all others where I myself could have wished them! The morning light found me busy in these cogitations. Julia I was resolved to see before I left the house; but how to do that without exciting alarm required a great deal of care and circumspection. I drew my sofa behind a large screen, which I was sure was never moved, and resolved to await the chances of her coming into the library in the course of the day. Sooner than I had expected my wish was grati- fied. About eight o'clock Dr. Flopp came into the room, and set himself down with an air of vast importance to the writing-table. "Let me know," he said to the servant as he entered, "when Miss Julia is in the breakfast-room. In the mean- time, I will write off an account of this-very wonderful ad- venture to Sylvanus Urban; and also to the police. 'Tis miraculous." Having watched till I was certain the door was shut, and hearing by the scratching on the paper that the doctor was hard at work, I slipped noiselessly from my hiding-place, and stood before him. "Thir!"I said, assuming again my lisp and whisper. "Great God! worse and worse! Mr. Snook!" "Yeth, thir; the thame. I've thomething to thay to you." "Say on, in heaven's name." "I am the acthepted lover of Julia Arran." "You F Mr. Snook. Why, how many accepted lovers has Miss Julia Arran?" "Only mythelf-any other man who pretendeth to her I will thoot as I would a tiger."  &#xD;<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC7943-00000161"/> 322         prfmas Ltore. i"Then, for God's sake, shoot the most intolerable villain that ever walked unhung. A rascal who this very night attempted to murder me in my sleep. I have a theory that you and he are very well matched against each other." "I don't care for him. All I can'thay ith thith, that if you don't conthent to my marrying Julia, I will marry her in thpite of you; thath all." "The deuce you will!, has she consented?" I nodded assent. "How? when?" "Will you not oppothe it if she doth conthent? If you do, you shall be antherable for the event. I'll have your heartth blood if you hethitate a moment." "Good God!- Mr. Snook-I've a theory this is the most dreadful business I ever had anything to do with. Do you say you are engaged to Miss Julia Arran?" "eth." "Then, who the devil was the villain that terrified me last night? He swore she was engaged to him." "And what did you thay?" !"Oh, aye--I had forgottenm Why I told him what was really the truth, Mr. Snook. ' She is engaged, with the full consent of her friends, to a most excellent young gentleman of the name of Neville. Now, I've a theory that she can scarcely have three husbands; you will therefore"---- "With the 'conthent of her friendth--with your con- thent?"  "CEh? oh; aye: yes--certainly." "Will you repeat that to her in my prethenth?" "Oh--surely, Mr. Snook, and here I believe she comes.' I slipped back into my corner.

"Haunted!" "Yes, haunted-and I suspect, Miss Julia, you know all about it." "About what, sir?" "Why, about certain gentlemen,;-you never heard of Mr. Snook, perhaps?" "Never, sir." "What! not a diabolical-looking-hem--I mean a tall- looking person with an abominable--I mean a considerable -lisp?" "No, sir; I never heard of him." "Nor of another fellow, with a voice like a kettle-drum -a scoundrel who has actually twice attempted to murder me? Even last night, in this very house, he threatened to take my life."        - "Oh, dreadful. Is it pos"---- "Possible? I tell you 'tis true, and at this very moment we are neither of us out of danger of instant death." "How!-Oh! what is it you say?" "I only wish Mr. Neville were here to guard us." "Mr. Neville, sir?" "Aye, Mr. Neville, madam; YOrE- Mr. Neville; the gentleman whom we all approve of. We have all con- sented to his proposals, you know." "Dr. Flopp," replied Julia, apparently very indignant, "I don't know what you mean by such language, or by such nodding and winking as you have now addressed me with. As oi Mr. Neville-after the opposition you have always made"-- "1 Never a bit of it.

The purity both of his sentiments amn his style, renders his works admirably adapted to the family library and      to the rising generation. "Can any author-can Sir Walter Scott, be compared with Goldsmith, for the variety, beauty, and power of his compositions?

"Few among the present readers of light literature-those ' omnivorous swallowers, who bolt every thing warm and reeking from the pregs-have enjoyedl the privilege of reading a new work from the pen of Washington Irving. For, to tell the truth, since that worthy gentleman has laid aside the pen with which so much that is memorable in American literature was conjured into being, a new and rabid class of readers has sprung into existence. Instead of the genial humor, the wholesome satire, the finished style of that distinguished author, we have pruriency, sar- casm, cant, flippancy, and commonplace. Readers, forty thousand to a book, have been found to batten on this unctuous melange, and the supply has continued with unabated malignancy. Imagination and fancy are alike unknown; they are dead, buried, and not likely to rise again The potency of a literature is infallibly tested by the reminiscences it provokes. An author who can people a little world of his own, with such beings as man can attach himself to, livea il the commonplace suggestiveness of the hour."-- . Y. Daily Times. "The other writings of Irving have been re-published and re-issued over and over again, in all sorts of editions, and still the demand for them flows on in a steady stream. -A library is in- complete without them. The name of Irving has given lustre to American letters. ile first, like the son, dissipated the mists of prejudice which blinded and obscured the vision of foreigners, and his warm and genial -rays first lighted up the pages of our national literature, and illustrated the answer to the sneering inquiry, ' Who reads an American book?' Hie, chief of all, has an English and Continental fame, while, to his own countrymen, his name is as a household word. He has equally the love and respeet of all his fellow citizens.. "' Mr. Irving publishes this work at the ripe age of 72. Ilis literary life has occupied more than half a century. It will make the old young again to read this volume, carrying them back, as it does, to the early promise of-the gifted writer, and leading them along over the many years during which they have been beguiled by his genius, instructed by his wisdom, ,and charmed by his sunny spirit and his hearty geniality." * * * -Rochester American. "The golden prose of Irving has long since sunk into the heart of every reader of the English language. -Ho is one of the rare few anticipating the verdict of posterity, and wearing, while living, the laurels of a classic. And no wonder, for his pure, genial sentiment, his clear thought, his musical sentences, his graphic words, form a combination of qualities that the whole range of English literature has never excelled. His style is transparent as a brook, slowing the ideas as clearly as the crystal element does its pebbles."--Albany Kvedko,booher. r -Do we really appreciate his works? The many pages that he has written. each .binding man more nearly to his fellow; the many sketches that have caused Nature to become doubly endeared to us; that have made the Alhambra live again in all its early glory; that have re- vealed to us the workings of Columbus' yearning mind; that have cast an eternal spring over the whole region of the Hudson; that have destroyed more prejudices than Political Reformers have revived, and have purified the every-day existence of this dollarous age, we cannot will- ingly pass unrecognized."--New Orleans Delta. "The library which does not contain these writings is indeed deficient."-C'Cam. Chronicle. "Great Britain, Franco, Northern and Southern Europe, are alike familiar- with his delight. ful, and most healthful writings, and doubtless his own sgood standing abroad has done more than any other single cause to introduce the names and works of others of our countrymen. There is a ctarm about his writings to which old and young, the educated and the simple, bear cheerful witness."--Christian Inquirer.

"' A work which will take its place in American households side by side with the Bible."- opress, . "It was peculiarly fitting that the brightest name in history should have put in requisition, for its conummemoration, one of the most gifted and accomplished sons of literature. Washingtonr Irving, whose literary fame scarcely knows a bound, bas, for many years, been occupied upon this work, the first volume of which we have now the pleasure to announces. It hlas been ela. borated with great patilence and care; and is not more remarkable for its exquisite grace and beauty of style, than for the richness of its biographical and historical details. The presen! volume relates to that portion of his life which preceded the period of the Revolution, and during whch he may be considered as having had his training for that great enterprise which at once rendered his name immortal, and marked a new and glorious ep ch in the history of the race It contains much that has not found its way into any previous life of Washington; ind even if it had been nothing more than the 1old material, moulded over by that graceful mind that tendi enchantment to every thing it touches, it would still have been justly regarded as a bright gez in our literature."-P Pritarn Recorder. "Before making any extracts from the work, we cannot but express our satisfaction at iti final completion. Its publication will form an important epoch in American literature. Th( life-long labors of its illustrious author could not have been crowned with a luore appropriate ter initiation. His name will henceforth be indissolubly connected with that of Washington, no only by his baptismal appellation, but by the noble monument which he has reared to hit memory. It was a befitting task that the writer who has left such a brilliant impress of hi, genius on the nascent literature of his country-whose fame is devoutly cherished in the heart, of the American people-held in equally affectionate remembrance in the rude cabins of the fron tier, the halls of universities. and the saloons of fashionable life-whose successes in the variei walks of classical composition have done as much to illustrate the character of America ir thb eye of the world as the eloquence of hbr senators or her prowess in armtn-should create a per manent memorial of Washington in a style worthy the dignity of the subject and the reputatioi of the author."'-Gazette, Reatding, Pa.

In justice to the publishers we may state, that the work has been got up in a style well worthy of its subject."-Eoenaing Bathetin, Ph d1a. "The time for representing Washington as a statue or a man of iron has gone by. He begins to be known as a man of immense passion. of the tenderest as well as strongest family affections, and of the most unaffected domesticity of taste. . . . All that patient and comprehensive re- search can do, Mr. Irving has done."- LChristiatn Inqzuirer. "This may be said to be the only life of Washington ever written. Irving has thrown around his story the eraces of his brilliant style, and imparted a variety to his pages which never suffers the interest of his readers to flag. His work is a real, solid acquisition to the living literature of the age. and will take its place among those favored few which will go down to posterity."-Pitts- bumrgh Gazette.

CHOICE WORKS OF J. FENIMORE COOPER, In Twenty Duodecimo Volumes, extra size. In newly stereotyping this Edition, extraordinary pains have been taken to produce a most perfect specimen of typography. and the most scrupulous care has been observed in the reproduction of the text, which has the Author's latest additions and corrections, besides his new, Intro- ductions, Notes, &amp;c. * * The Works of COOPER, while their illustrious author was alive, awere acknowledged, in other countries, to be the finest examples of Amer- ican genius. and the noblest as well as the truest exhibitions of American intellect and feeling. At home, personal and partisan influences prevented the universal recognition of their extraordinary and peculiar merits. But all prejudices and asperities being buried in the grave. the people have dis- passionately examined the claims of " our great national novelist,"' and their applause is awarded in acclamations. Never, in the proudest day of his life, was he so popular. Not a month has passed since the close of his splendid career, in which the general demand for his writings has not in- creased; and now, through all the Union it is as well understood that the works of Cooper should constitute a portion of the Family Library, as in Spain, that every reader should possess Cervantes; or in Germany, that Goethe, or in England, that Shakspeare, should be familiar in every culti- vated household. Although much of this popularity is undoubtedly owing to their decided and intelligent nationality; yet, perhaps as much results from the just conviction that no other author, so eminent in his depart- ment, has ever before been so uniformly pure in morals and elevated in sentiment. No other body of romance, in any language, is so healthful and invigorating. This collection comprises- 1. THE SPY,      8. LIONEL LINCOLN,  14. HOMEWARD BOUND, 2. THE DEERSLAYER,   9.

This he successfully accomplished in 1858-4, disguised as a Mohaim- medan Dervish. The history of the pilgrimage is not surpassed in in- terest and originality by. any book of travel ever published-nembracing his residence at Cairo as Mohanmmedan student; the journey across the desert with the great annual caravan of Pilgrims; the visit to the to11b of Mohammned; the discovery that the sacred black stone of Mecca is an aerolite; the annual sermon preached at Mecca to an estimated audience of 150,000 Pilgrims, gathered from' all parts of the ,Moslem world; his narrow escapes from detection; and the only accurate atcount of the cere- monies of the Mussulman faith.          j To the religious community this work furnishes infolrmation never be- fore made public, respecting the ceremonial laws of a large proportion of the population of the Eastern world ; while for general interest Burton's narrative will compare favorably with either Eothen, or Crescent and the Cross.

When tales are written in a pure and chaste style; when they interest us in behalf of virtue, and render vice more odious; when they excite our best sympathies and inculcate good morals, they become good teachers. Too often the field of fiction is invaded by the chiffoniers of literature. and the most improbable and extravagant events are detailed in a bloated and exaggerated style, garnished with immorality, calculated to deprave the taste and corrupt the heart. Of such a nature are the stories of the flash newspapers and twenty-five cent yellow-covered pamphlets foisted into circulation by extravagant puffing. In the volume before us we have a series of charming tales, as instructive as they are interesting. The work is neatly got up, and should beoome a part of every geteel library in the land--Broeklyn Eagle.   Sf. P. Putnam &amp; b's Publications. CAPT. WT',tg'RR, . s t, NARRATIVE OF TEE U. S.

BUYGTONPS PILGRIMAG   E TO XECCAH. (See Page 16.) This book is a novelty in the literature of Travels. It describes from actual inspection and adrmeasurement the sacred cities, the inmost shrines and Holy of Iioiies of the Moslem faith. While other travellers have stood afar off and gleaned from reluctant and deceitful sources some scanty, incorrect, and contradictory scraps of information concerning the Mohammedan shrines and worship, Lieut. Burton, taking his life in his hand, and assuming, after months and even years of preparation, the character of a devout son of Islam, has not only "seen with his own eyes what others have been content to ' hear with ears'-namely, the Moslem's inner life in a really Mohammedan country," and traversed lands which no tourist had yet described or mea- sured, but has penetrated to the tomb of the Prophet at Medinah and to the Kaabah at Meccah. As a " personal narrative," the account in detail of the ways and means and dangers of a jour- ney from London to the very heart of Arabia, is full of interest. All future travellers in this direction will profit by Lieut. Burton's experience, though few will venture to follow in his footsteps. The descriptions of natural scenery will serve to correct some popular notions of desert life. But the great value of the book consists in the fresl, vivid, and reliable views it gives of the present state of the Moslem faith and ceremonial worship. Here there can be no Inistake. For our author relates not merely what he has heard or seen, but himself an orthodox Mohammedan of the straightest sect, obeying the Prophet's command to all the faithful, once in their lives to make the pilgrimage to the sanctuary at Meccah--he said and saw and did all that is enjoined or permitted to believers To execute the extraordinary task he had imposed oi himself. Lieut. Burton "landed at Alexandria, already wearing his disguise; practised his con "aliment successfully during a stay of some weeks at that city, and afterwards on the Nile an* at Cairo-fasting in Ramazan, talking theology, and saying his prayers like a good Mussulmnar in the character of a Dervish or Indian Doctor. Passing this first ordeal unsuspected, he CelOSsty the desert to Suez, and joining a party of pilgrims from 'll the nations of Asia, he actual!) reached Medinah. saw with profane eyes the Tomb of the Prophet, penetrated to Mecccah, visited there the Kaabah, and returned in safety I " In energy, tact, and perseverance, Lieut. Burton resembles our own Bayard Taylor, whose introduction enriches the American reprint, which is beautifully issued'in the best style of G. P.
