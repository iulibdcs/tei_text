To the Craftsmen, of the United States: In getting up the series of publications of which this is the first number, I am actuated by a desire to popular- ize masonic literature of the lighter, as well as heavier class. As the outlines of the Masonry of King Solomon's times are vague and shadowy, I have chosen fiction as the best means of illustrating the' condition of' the craft at that period of the Wotld's history. I leave to the reader the task of discerning traces of our fiaternity in the story For a like reason I have taken the same nledium for illustrating the condition of the craft at the time of the first introduction of Masonry in England, and in the third pamphlet I hate taken the story teller's method of show- 'ing the benefits of membership in the Lodges at the present day.  The materials for the other proposed numbers of the Library of Cheap Masonic Publications have accumulated on my hands during an active connection with Masonik? Newspapers extending aver a period of nearly twenty years; that they will be found valuable and interesting by the brethren, I have no doubt.  &#xD;<pb n="0" xml:id="VAC7765-00000004"/> Should my life be spared to carry out my plan, the whole series will form a Library at once cheap and com- prehensive. The time of publication of each number will be announced on the cover of the one which precedes it, and the size of page and style of make-up willbe kept the same as in this pamphlet, so that they can be bound into books of uniforli size. The great cost of getting together a Masonic Library has hitherto prevented brethren of moderate means from attempting to accomplish so desirable an end, and to such my present enterprise will be lhailed as the right thing in the right time and place. It may not satisfy the hyper- critical, but it is, at any rate, an attempt in the right direction. Fraternally, THE COMPILER.   THE SIGNET OF HRAM. A TALE OF THE FIRST TEMPLE. CHAPTER 1. In the year of 1012, B. C., the ancient city of Jerusalem was in its glory. David, the Warrior Prince, had passed away, leaving his throne and a compact and powerful kingdom to his son Solomon. Peace reigned throughout Judea, commerce flourished, and the people worshipped the Most High God according to his Divi&amp;re ccommand. For years David had been accumulating gold and silver and other materials to build a house for the Lord; the splendor and magnificence of which should far transcend that of the heathen temples among the surrounding nations. But his hands were red with blood; he had fought many bat- tles;^and because he was a man of blood the Lord God would not allow him to accompli is is design, and lhe died, leaving the building of the Temple as a sacred legacy to hisison and suceessor, King Solorion. This wise King continued the compact entered into by his father with Hiram, King of Tyre, whose dominions extended over the Northern part of what is now known as Palestine, em- bracing the part of the Forest of Lebanon where the best  &#xD;<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC7765-00000005"/> 4         SIGNET OF HRAiM; and tallest cedars grew. By a'ftither compact between these two enlightened and hzinorable Princes, Hiram was to send his workmen int) thi' forests of Lebanon, fell and prepare cedar trees, as many as shouldt be required for the Temple, and convey them in floats to Joppa, whence the craftsmen of Solomon took them to Jerusalem. And the wao'es of Hiram's men were corn, wine, and oil:- There seenms, also, to have been a warm personal attachment be- tween these two Kings, and of his own motion, it appears, Hiram of Tyre senlt to Solomon, Hiram the widows' son, a workman of transcehdeint skill; whose mother was of the tribe of Dan, but whose father was a man of Tye. The workmen upon the Teutple, and in the forests, were all classified and arranged by those three men into three divisions, Bearers of Burdlens, Craftsmen, and Mas- ters, each class having its peculiar means of recognizing each other by day-or night. From the middle men or Crattsmen, were chosen overseers for the first class, the principal part of whose labors were in the forest and quarries. The spirit which animated King Solomon and histwo friends, and the rulers of Israel, seems to have been generaly diffused through all the thousands of work- ien upon the sacred edifice. They knew that the plans for the Temple came from the Most High himself, and that theyi were instruments chosen to--work out his will. They knew that thevery site of the building was holy ground. There, on Mt. Moriah, was the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, where King David had met and ap- peased the destroying angel; and there too was the spot where occurred the memorable strife between the two   A TALE OF THE FIRST TEMPLE. .     5 brothers, as to which should be most gracious and gen- erous to the other in the division of the wheat they had jointly grown there. They knew; too, that so sacred was the edifice they were called upon to erect that no metal tool must profane it, its sacred chambers must not echo to the sound of ax or hdLnmer. And so for several years they labored harmoniously together, the greatest contention be- tween them being as to who best could work, and best agrea. Strange indeed would it be, if among so many worklnen there were not found, before the Temple was completed, some uneasy and ambitious or wicked spirits, whose conduct should mar the general harmony. Such  were found-three of them in all, among whom was one more daring and wicked than the others, whose history  we propose to trace in connection with that of other per- sons, in the chapters which follow. Carrying our minds back nearly three thousand years let us enter the forests of Lebanon. At this time, on the slope of at valley in the e treme nortern district of Pales- tine, amid a group of ancient cedars, stood the abode of AsheL; a;d Bithali, his wife. This Worthy man was one of the overseers of the woodcutters, who were scattered throu'gh the forest, engaged in felling and preparing tim- bers to: the great Temple at Jerusalem. The valley on whose slope their cottage stood, was fomed by two ridges connecting the higher ranges of the--mountain with the plain, and which in modern tiites have received the name of the Spurs of Lebanon, and from which tributary tor-  &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7765-00000006"/> 6         SIGNET OF HRAM; rents, fed from the snowy sunnits, canme rushing down to water the fields of Galilee. There was nothing remark- able about the cottage. It had stood there for four years, or ever since Asher had been, by order of the higher pow- ers at Jerusalem, assigned to the post of overseer of the woodcutters in that vicinity. The vine and lie fig trel- lised over the doorway, and interwoven with the rose and the hyssop, spread a grateful shade. On the flat roof, bundles of flax spread in order told of the industry of Bithiah, and on the cedar lintels and door-posts could be seen traces of portions of the Mosaic law, which had been carved upon them. Through the garden flowed a small stream of pure water, bordered with the lilies and an- emones; rocks partially covered with the almond, the citron and pine formed the barriers of the garden, and to the right,. rose high over all the snow-clad summits of Hermon. Two children gladdened this forest home, a boy of fourteen and a girl of twelve years of age. The boy, Elanm b' name, had a bland and open countenance, with the distinctive features which mark the Hebrew race. He was bronzed by the Eastern sun, and over his Shoulders hung masses of glossy -jet hair, while eyes of unusual brilliancy sparkled beneath an ample forehead and spoke of that gentleness which is not incompatible with the higher attributes of manhood. His sister, Rachel, was of more delicate mould, but possessed of a beauty by no means rare among the daughters of Israel; The brother and sister were warmly attached to each other, and Elarn made it his pleasure to conform his tastes and amusements to those of his sister. She in turn delighted to share in   A TALE OF THE FIRST TEMPLE.     7 her brother's care bf their flocks and herds, and when they were folded for the night, their greatest pleasure was to sit in the cottage garden and watch for their father's re- turn from his labors in the forest. On the evening upon which our narrative begiis, to- wards the close of summer, at the end of the Jewish month Elul, Rachel had been seated for two long hours on the knoll by 'the side of the garden stream, looking anxiously for her father's return. She was all the more eager to welcome him as Elam had gone two days before to a little distance on a visit, and was not expected back until the following day. Long ere this hour of the day her father had been wont to appear to the loving watcher, as eager for her welcome as she was to give it. But in vain now did the girl look for his long drawn shadow flitting through the trees, or listen to catch the notes of some favorite Hebrew melody, with which the wood- cut- ter was wont to beguile the distance, or give intimation of his approach. Nothing could she hear but the murmur of the soft gliding rivulet, or the hum of the mountain-bee winging, its way back for the night, laden with spoil, to some cleft in the rocks which all around were supplied with wild honey. Slowly the sun sunk to rest among the rosy clouds of the west; twilight merged into nighit, and Rachel took refuge from the falling dew within the cot- tage. "Where can father be?" said the girl, looking wistfully with her bl ight black eyes into her mother's face, who also was beginning to feel surprised at the unusual delay. "Something, my child, musthave detained him on the  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7765-00000007"/> 8        SIGNET OF HRAM; mountains; but the God of our father is with him-even the Keeper of Israel, who neither slumbers nor sleeps." "Surely ne evil can have befallen him," continued Rachel. "I know I should not think of sucht thilns; but I cannot help it."  "Be patient my child,"' said the mother, "thou knowest that it is on the eve of the passover, and of thy father's desire to be in readiness with Elam for' the holy feast. This may have led him to encroach on the first watch, to- night,' that his w6rk foi the week may be the sooner com- pleted." "But could he not have missed his way," pursued Rachel, her mirid still on the thought of danger. "1No, surely not, child, with such a moon as that to guide him," replied her mother-a bright gleam at that moment bursting from behind a cloud and lighting up tle cottage. "Or, Worse still," continued the little Jewess, as fiesh reasons for disquietude occurred to her-"may he not have suffered from the great heat? The sun's rays aiay have struck him down, as they threatened to do last year; and then, dear mother, what would become of us?" "Hush! hush, my child! do not make thyself and me unhappy. He is in better hands than ours. The stars in their courses fought against Sisera; but," she added, to herself, "a wife and mother in Israel will take comfort in the word of Him who saith; 'The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.'" Rachel, still-forebodirg, was about to reply, when her mother, affectionately em racing her, prevailed on her to ,  \   A TALE OF THE FIRST TEMPLE.      9 retire to rest, with the promise of an early waking, when her father himself would be the first at her bedside, to exn plain the cause of the delay. Bithiali busied herself with household cares, making ready to welcome her husband when he should come. At first she would not allow herself to feel that there was any cause for alarm. As hour after hour passed, however, her fears began to increase, and would not be dismissed at her bidding. Again and again she unbared the door and listened for the wished-for footfall; but no sound disturbed the quiet scene. The moonn lighted up the valleywith her silvery radiance, .and the only signs of motion were the ripples of sparkling light which her beams cast on the stream below. Had Elam been with her, his presence would have served, in some degree, to allay her misgiv,. ings. As it often happens when the mind is unstrung, painful apprehensions were beginning to mingle with other and mnore likely reasons for his detention. Could Rachel's surmise be correct? Had he lost his way? Did she not recently hear him speak of .the number, of fieice wolves which he had seen in the -highest ranges of Le- banon? B;t then she consoled herself with the remem brance that he was not alone. His companions, some of them, Lved on his loute homeward, some distance from the localfty where they were at labor.' So, replenishing her lamp, she resolved. to wait as patiently as shecould until day-dawn,.trusting ere then to have her fears riev- ed, and he able to fulfill her promise to Rachel, who, locked in slumber's gentle embrace, was all unconscious ' the anxieties which'were not soon' to be allayed.  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7765-00000008"/> 10()       SIGNET OF HRAM; CHAPTER II. The valley, upon the slope of which stood the cottage of Asher and Bithial, was called the valley of Abdol. At its extremityand about half a league from the' cottage was one of the few other dwellings in that remote and secluded part of Lebanon. -aIt was the:abode of two brothers. The elder was the' intimate friend and companion of Asher Ever since the levies had been sent into the forest by the command of King Solomon they had been associated as hewers of wood on the mountain. In no way related by blood, their minds seemed to have been cast in the same modld. Both were by nature full of th: warmth' and gen- erosity of noble affections. To these natural graces were added another charm. They were twinned in religious faith, knelt at th, same altar,and worshiped the same God -the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. Together they toiled, and their voices frequently joined in chanting those sublime strains which have since thrilled on the lips ofthousands of every tongue and clime, and which were then, comparatively, fresh from the inspired Harp of the Royal Bard of Judah. Jobal, was this elder brother's name, and it would have been well for him'and others,and   A T oALE OF THE FIRST'TEMPLE. A TALE OF THE FIRST' TEMPLE.    " have brightened an otherwise checkered existence, if his brother, who shared with him his pastoral home, had also partaken of his lofty qualities of heart. But Jahaz had a nature directly the reverse of his brother's. Of a dark and sinister countenance, he was morose and selfish,ever grasp- ing at what he could not attain,and longing for what could not be his. This difference between them was a source of pain to the amiable Jobal, who made it his study an lI in- terest to accomodate himself to the less pliable and for- giving temper of his brother. For a while they lhad worked together with Asher in the mountains, but Jahaz had, fur some time been engaged in cultivating the Olive' grounds aroun'd their cottage, and herding the flocks and cattle which formed the principal part of their possessions. Their family was of Jewish descent,but they were Tyrians by birth, and while Jobal embraced with ardor the Jewish faith, which formed such a strong bond between hin and his bosom friend, Asher, Jahaz sullenly clung to the super- stitions which had been taught him in his boyhood. And this religious difference was one of the many sources of trouble between the brotheirs, and out of it grew Jahaz's hatred, bitter, and inveterate, to Asher. On one occasion, while they labored together in the forest, Jahaz taunted his brother with having apostatized from the faith cf his nation. "Nay, brother," said Jobal, "if there be any apostasy, it is thou who art the apostate. Our ancestors were of Judea and worshipped the living God." And then Asher interfered, with sdne warmth, defend-  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7765-00000009"/> 12   i     SIGNET OF HRAM;. ing the faith of the Jews, and speaking with pity of the ig- iorance of the nations which knew rot God. "And said he in conclusion, "It seems to' me 'passing strange that thou who hast, wrought on the Sacred Temple, and receiv- ed a craftsman's wages, should yet grovel in the,'darkness of heathenism."  "Jew, who made thee a judge over me,' answered Jahaz, hotly. " "What were the promises to the craftsmen when we were engaged for this work? Have we received any part of that for which we wrought save the miserable pit- tance of, corn, wine, and oil? "Nay, nay, biother," said Jobal, "the Master will per- form his promise, when the Temple is completed. Surely, Hiram of Tyre never yet violated his word. For myself, if the promise be not fulfilled, still I shall rejoice that I 'joined the bands of Temple workmen, since by coiiing here, thanks to thee, brother Asher, I have attained to a knowledge of the true and living God.", "Methinks," said Asher, "brother Jahaz has little confi- dence in the word of his august countryman; has he as little in the Prince of Israel, our great King Solomon? Thihk'st thou, brother, that he would allow any injustice to those who are faithful to' the end?"  "What' boots it to thee," angrily retorted Jahaz, "what my thoughts or my opinions are? And who is your King that I should care aught for him? Thou hast won from me the heart of my 'brother, wilt thou now make me thy slave? I tell thee, had I the power, the whole craft should assemble at Jerusalem at once and unitedly ae-   A TALE OF THE FIRST TEMPLE.     13 mand of those laughty rulers the fulfillment of some part of the promises of Hiram of Tvre." Asher and Jobal were shocked at the' insubordination and violence of Jahaz, and the formner rebuked him sharp- ly for the evil example he had set to the workmen, who had gathered around him. Soon after this scene, the turbulent fellow was'removed from the work through the influence of Asher, as overseer, who felt that serious trouble with the workmen might grow out of his presence among them. And so, with increasing bitterness towards Asher in his heart, Jahaz went back to the cottage, and began to till the ground and watch the flocks owned by himself and brother, in which occupation we found him. Asher bore the enmity of Jahaz with patient and. dignifi- ed silence, and the friendship between him and Jobal con- tinued as warm and abiding as ever, notwithstanding, ap-  preaching in romantic devotion the attachment of David and Jonathan. To make the ties still stronger between them, the son of Jobal, a dying legacy of the dearly be- loved wife of his early manlood-a noble and brave youth of fifteen, conceived a boyish attachment for the gentle Rachel, and the two weie early betrothed by their parents, after the manner of those times. And now let us go back and take up the thread of our narrative, which we left at the close of our second chapter. In the afternoon of the day when Asher,'as we have seen, was so anxiously expected, himself and his friend Jobal had been engaged as usual, on one of the upper ridges of Lebanon, cutting down cedar trees and preparing them for transportation to Joppa. The ringing. sound of other  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7765-00000010"/> "      , SIGNET. OF HRAM; axes than theirs showed that other workmen, not far off, were similarly occupied. The monotonous strokes were nW and then varied by a crashing noise, which told that some ancient denizen ofthe forest had :bowed to the in- exorable decree of destiny, and fallen prone upon the earth, from whose bosom it sprang. "Another score of such, brotherl" said Jobal to his com- panion, "and we shall be ready for ou. journey. Verily, I -envy thy trusty young Elaim his first pilgrimage." "May our father's God prosper him!" replied Asher; "thou mayest well believe he can talk of but little else. For weeks the sacred words have been on his sister's lips, and on his own: 'I was glad when they said unto me, let us go into the house of the Lord; our feet shall stand within thy gates, O, Jerusalem.' Though it be a father's testimony, I shall gladly make the heart of so dutiful a boy happy."  "The blessing of the God of Jacob go with you both," said Jobal, "may he gladden you in your journey and ful- fill all his promises to those you leave unprotected be- hind '     ." "Amen," said Asher, reverently: "  I have never yet returned from the festival but I have found a blessing. Never was my flock, during my absence, diminished, nor did the footsteps of plunderers invade my dwelling." "Art thou all in readiness?" said Jobal. "Elam has gone to Laish, to get the necessaries requi- site for the way. To-morrow I expect him back, and seven days hence, by the will of God, we shall proceed on our pilgrimage."    A TALE OF THE FIRST TEMPLE.     15 From this conversation the reader will easily guess that the great Jewish feast of the Passover was about to ake place at Jerusalem.  At this feast, according to the Mosaic law, all the males of Judea were wont to repair to the Holy City. Often they started on the journey sev-e eral weeks before the time for the celebration, pursuing their way leisurly, by the clear light of the Moon at night in order to avoid the heat of the sun, which at that sea- son of the year is intense. They cheered each other as they journeyed, by singing or. chanting the songs of David and Solomon, many of which Were peculiarly appropriate - to the sacred occasion. We can well imagine that, to the genuine Israelite, these festivals were seasons of especial gladness, and that more especially would they he so' to youths like Elam, -who were for the first time to be intro- duced to scenes with which they had been familiar, by hearsay, from earliest childhood. But we digress. The two woodcutters were proceeding vigorously with their labors.' They had felled four noble giants of Leba- non since morning, and several others of equal dimensioins, hard by, were marked to follow. Jobal was busily clean- ing off some of the lower branches of the next cedar iark- ed to fall, and Asher, was close behind him, making tle Yreat trunk of another vibrate to his vigorous strokes. Suddenly his ax glanced and struck his comrade full in  ;le temple, and Jobal fell, with a deep, heavy groan, his ace pale and convulsed,. and the red blood trickling fast rom the ghastly wound. "Jobal, Jobal ' exclaimed Asher, in a voice of agony, can it be-" but his voice choked-he could say no more.  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7765-00000011"/> 16       SIGNET OF HRAM; A stifled groan answered him. He quickly brought a flagon of water from the adjacent brook, and mingling wine with it from a leathern bottle lying on the grass at his side, applied it to the other's palid lips. But all signs of consciousness were gone. "God of my fathers," cried the poor man afresh in his anguish, "in thy great mercy forbid that these innocent hands should be stained with the blood of mni best and kindest friend!" But Asher quickly realized that there was no time fiir unavailing sorrow, and hastened to call assistance from his nearest comrades. Soon a saddened group were gath- ered around, spectators of the mournful scene. Human aid was of no avail. The dying man became conscious for a moment, and had just enough strength to grasp his friend's hand and mutter in his ear some words, too bro- ken for the others to comprehend, when his eyes closed to open no more, and the strong man of but a momient before was stretched out lifeless on the turf! Again and again did, Asher cast himself on the ground, with his face to- wards Jerusalem, and pray that Jehovah in his mercy, would yet restore the Spirit which had fled, but all in vain. The workmen formed a rude pallet of cedar bran- ches, and laying the body thereon, with the face covered, the sorrowing procession set out in the direction of the dead man's home. The woodcutter's thoughts had, till now, been solely occupied with the fate of his bosom friend. But the first flush of anguish was over; and how there came. to his memory those last stammered utterances reminding him that Jahaz now stood towards him in the relation of the Avenger of Blood. The expiring breath of friendship   A TALE OF THE FIRST TEMPLE.     17 had warned himn to flee to the nearest city of Refuge, so mercifully provided by the Masonic law. From the vin- lictive Jahaz ihere was no hope of mercy. Yet how could he flee? How separate himself from the faithful Bitliah and his loving children? But life was at stake, and bet- ter were years of captivity than a horrible death, the wid- owhood of his wife and the orphanage of children, dearer to him than life itself. And might not the longest hours of captivity be lightened by the thought that, possibly, he might yet return once more to the hearth and home of his affections? The Jubilee Year woIld ' come, as the wheels of time moved onward in their ceaseless round. The shadees of night' fell long ere they reached the neighborhood of Jobal's cottage. After venturing as far as he thought safe, Asher lingered a little- behind the mourners, and availing himself of an opening in the wood, made his way by the aid of the starlight and his own knowledge of the winding patils, as fast as he could up the valley to his own cottage. Many and sad were the thoughts which crolsed his mind in that lone midnight journey. He had left hs family in the. morning happy and joyous; le was returning to bid them a sad farewell. His hand, although it was by apainful accident, was stain- ed with a brother's blood, and witlh the vengeful kinsman of the slain, the voice of that brother', blood would cry loudly against him. Yet he knew that an Ahnightv Pro- tector was over all, and to him he could confidently coln- mit his wife and children. The painful anxiety of Bithialh was broken in upon to- wards morning, by a gentle tapping at the lattice, aceom- s                 .  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7765-00000012"/> 18        SIGNET OF HRAM; panied by a voice: "The Lord be with thee. Undo the latch. It is I. I have but a moment." Strangely agi- tated as it was, and unlike her husband's joyous tones, she recognized the voice, and his call was speedily an- swered. "WhAt evil has befallen thee," exclaimed Bitlhiah, as her eager gaze fell upon his )ale features. and quivering lips. "I cannot tell," he said in broken words, "I cannot tell all the sad truth. I nrust be within the gates of Kedesh before the sun again sets. It was the deed of an innocent hand, but it ha's brought upon me long sought vengeance."'

They are at hand. I knew he would not tarry. Farewell! Farewell! The Lord God will be thy sun and thy shield!" So saying, he plunged into the forest.

The rest of the party remained 'to comnort the stricken mother in Israel until day dawned, but Jahaz, the Aven- ger, plunged into the tfoest glade in the direction of the City of Refuge. In the North of Galilee, far froln any fteuented iigh- way, ran a road which led through a valley overhung with cedars and sycanores. Qn the craggy slopes'above, shepherds were feeding their flocks, and the music of their reeds floated softly down into the valley on the quiet air of the earlv morning. No-other sound was heard save that made by the bounding of some light-footed gazelle as it descended the steep slope t i slake its thirst at the brook. Along this road, a man arrayed in a white tuni-, gathered to his waist by a leathern girlle, was seen run- ning in breathless haste. A shepherd, observing him in tle distance, left his feecy charge and clamberedl down the steep to inquire the stranger's alarm. But the way- farer, Asher of Abdol, barely waved his band, to give in- titation that he could not be delayed on his errand. Drops stood on his brow; his tongue was parched,' and he cast longing glances at the streamlets which furrowed the slopes here and there, and at the purplle wild grapes which hung in profusionr from the vines which in wild luxuriance clambered up the steeD rocks   On he rushed, for life depended on his haste.

Anon he had arrived where two roads met; i'y a bridge across the rivulet whosecourse heehad been fol- lowing. Panting and exh!austed, he stopped to consider his one continuing, directly on, and the other leading directly course. He had not long to pause, tor straight before him, as lie turned to the right, wasa post, and on its top a sign bonrd with the word "REFGITE," and a finger pointing towards Kedesh. Inan instant the bridge was crossed,and, faint and weary, he hurried up the slope. Might he not slacken his pace K. Might it not be that he was mistaken in his ap- prehensions of plursuit by the'Avenger? No! i'or as he  paused :the sound of  fHeeter steps than his own smote 'his ear, crossing the bridge over the brook. There were but a f.:w stone-casts between him and death. Hastily re-adjusting 1;Is sandals, and inoistening his parch- td lips with water from a scanty pool at the spot, lhe s prang utpon his way. Ordinarily, he Was m!ore than a mlatch for his pursuer, but now mental and bodily fatigue lhad told upon his powers of muscle, and the vindictive Jahaz was Wslowly igaiinilg Qn him. As he attained the hill the sight whichh iet his eyes gave him fresh courage. Before him stretched the beautiful llain of Zaanain, and to his right rose the lotty hill of Naphtali, on one of the lower of ridges of which glittered in the sunbeams',the walls of Kedesh. His road conducted straight to a clus- ter of lofty palm trees, such as generally umlk the gate of Jewish cities. It was a moment of thrilling trepidation. Life and death were quivering in the balance. If through faintness or exhaustion his limbs failed him, no power on earth could save him. The rapid tread of the Avenger be-  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7765-00000014"/> 22        SIGONJT OF TIRAM'; hind him echoed in his ears, and by the roadside hleap's of stones, now and then, told where ,unfortunate nianslayers had been overtaken and slain. On he prlesed, and at the last, he sank downfainting, inside the massive gate, which at once closed on its hinge*, and forbade the entrance of the baffled pursuer. The anger of Jahaz had no bounds. Cursing with the little breath he had left, he flung himself on the grourid, and threw from him the weapon he had concealed in his tunic, and with which he had hopedto reach the heart of his intended victim. No sooner was Asher within the gates of the city than he was surrounded by a crowd of people, curious to see the refugee. Soon a Levite came, and supported by iinm thq weary man was taken to a cool and well-aired chamn- ber near the gate. Here they took off his sandals, wasli- ed his weary feet, gave him some scanty refreshnments, and left him to seek the, repose so needed by his' exhaust- ed frame. Early next morning the seven judges were convened in the Hall of Justice. Jahaz was there, haggard and pale, yet with the fire of hate still burning in his eye. Soon Asher was led in between two officers, and took his place in the farther end of the hall. His white tunic had been exchanged for a long thread-bare garment, his beard had been shorn, his hair was dishevelled, and his head cover- ed with dust. Scarce had he made obeisance to his judg- es when a fresh shower of dust was cast at him by Jahaz -the usual mode by which the Avenger expressed the nature of his accusation. As Asher glanced, with a dis-   A TALK' )F THE :FHRSTl'TEMPLE.  turbed look, ablout him, he )obser ved amt lg thee the venerable' firl of Gideon of Zai)har, ail aged and' patriarch in Israel, and one who was much b  by all wh- knew him. Thoughnot one of the judges!y for his wisdom and sanctity he was often wittih tlen to give counsel. The time for the trial came, and the 'venge- fill Jahaz prefel:.ed a charge of malice against the man- slayer, and that the deed of blood had beei long nmedita- ted, and was at last affected in the silence and secrecy of the forest, in fancied security from the hand of justice. Calmly and manfully did Asher relel the charge, and stated fully the particulars of the accident, adding; with tearful eyes' and quivering lips, that lmost gladly would he. exchange places with his dead friend. But by the Jewish law this was of no avail--his enemy's tale was just as plausible as his own. He must have witnesses to corroborate his story. His position was indeed perilous.  But at this juncture Gideon of Zaphar intervened, and succeeded in obtaining froml the judges a stay of proceed- ings for a week, that testimony from the wood-cutters of Lebanon might be obtained. It was unnecessary, how- ever, for by this time the noise of footsteps was heard Without the door, and the trusty colmpanions of Asher, in tho mournful night march from the heights of Lebanon to the valley' of Abdol, were ushered in. The face of the almost condemned mar. was lighted up with joy at the al - pearance of his faithful friends. Their testimony was positive, and he was adjudged entitled to the protection of the city of Refuge, and assigned a suitable abode. He had time tor but a few wordls with his old comrades,  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7765-00000015"/> 24       ..

From a freeman, breathing the bal- imy air of Lebanon, he was now cooped up in a single apartment i'n one of the narrow streets of a refuge city. All was in strange contrast with his pleasant cottage home at Abdol, and,. the excitement and uncertainty ,of the trial being over, his tholghts reverted to his ehanged circumstances, and a dismtal feeling of homesickness came over him. While indulging in a train of gloomy ;thought, a knock was jleard at his door. He bade the comer enver, and in a moment Gideon of'Zaphar stood before him. The oldl man had come to comfort him, and .volunteervd to make a pilgrimage to Abdol and bring the unfortuenat Asher news of- the loved ones so hurriedly left behind him. Kedesh was the principal residence ot old Gidop, but ihe was accustomed to make journies ftion pjace tp place in Galilee, and was warmly welcomed whreerr he t chose to stop, and "Gideon's chamber," became a house- hold word in the dwelling of many a pious Jew. Is it altogether impossible to appease the avenger," asked Asher of the old prophet, -'anid purchase mly release from this sanctuary city by a mnoney-ranisoin?"   A TALE OF THE FIRST TEMPLE.     25 "Impossible-utterly impossible," said old Gideon. "This aged voice has pleaded successfully for many things, but for this I dare not plead. If thou takest the advice of an old Israelite, dream not of ecape, or attempt in any way to evade the law. There is nothing for thee but pa- tient submission to the will of the Lord." "Amen," replied Asher, "the will of God be done! Thy servant should Ihave known better than to have thoiglt of such a thing." "Here is my copy of our holy law," said the otherl pre- senting him with a well-worn scroll. Take it as g pledge of affection from one who knew thy father before thee. Mine own eyes will soon be too dim to read it; let it be handed down to thy children as a remembreance of 9od Gideon of Zaphar.

So saying the aged prophet closed behind him the ldor of Asher's apartment, and left him with a heart swelling with gratitude. We- must hastenl over this portion of out narrative, or our tale will be spun out to an unwarranted leligth. Siuf fice it to say, that Gideon of Zaphar performed the enis- sion he promised to undertake, and in due time crossed the threshold cf the aflicted cottagers at Abdol.

To the latter's anxious inquiries, old Gideon said: "All is well, my son. At least I bring thee no heavy tidings. The God of Israel has spread his shield of pro- tection over those thou lovest. Thy household survives the rude shock which severed them in one night from llus- band and father; but I will make known to thee all the truth," "Keep nothing back from me." "There is nothing in what I am to tell thee but what might have been expected. That teirible night was too much for the tender spirit and fragile body of the mother ot thy children. It is no mortal ailment, but her eyes are no longer gladdened by the light of day. So extreme has been her bodily weakness that for some time she has been unable to go without help to her favorite seat under the willow tree." Tears filled the eyes of Asher. "Ah, that seat," said he, "it is where she was wont to sit and watch my evening return; but woe is me!-Andi how are the children " "Two precious young olive plants," said the old man; "these are their remembrances;" and he opened his wallet and put into Asher's hands a few dried plants and forest- flowers. The simplicity of the memorial caused a fresh gush of tears. "Be comforted,. my son. Il have ere long promised to return to thy Lebanon home with tidings of how it fares with thee." "The will of the Lord be done," said Asher. "And though we meet no more on earth, nothing can forbid ar everlasting union in a better world!" And so they parted again.   A TALE OF THE FIRST TEMPLE.      27         . o CHAPTER IIl. Let us again revert to the fatal accident on Mt. Lebanon. The household of the slain Jobal consisted of but three persons besides himself-his brother Jahaz, an elderly Jewess who cared for the, domestic arrangements, and his young daughter, Nain. We will not atthOmpt to describe the grief and woe which settled on the orphan girl when she realized the extent of the calamity which had fallen upon her in the death of her idolized father. She sat for a time in stony grief, swaying to and fro, her hair dishevr elled, her eyes dryand tearless, and her ashen lips mur- nmuring in broken accents, "My father! alas ' my father." In vain her foster mother endeavored to console her. Her ears were deaf to, the voice of affectionate condolence, and the words of tender faith in Jehovah, the father of the fatherless, failed to reach the fountains of her sorrow. So she sat and mourned through the long night of darkness, nor did the blessed sunlight as the'next morning it smil- ed sweetly down into the green Valley of Abdol, dissipate the dark clould which enveloped her spirit, But when she had looked her last upon the pale, serene face of thie dead, and Jobal had been lain in the tomb of his fathers with all tihe solemnities of a Jewish burial, tears, blesse d tears, came to her relief, and the tender tones of the aged handmaid who had cared for her from her earliest infancy, penetrated to her heart, and saddened, sorrowful aind  &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7765-00000017"/> 28       XSI(NET OF HRAM; weary, she came back and patiently took up the heavy burden which had been laid upon her young life. She noted the absence of her uncle, and, not divining its cause, asked of his whereabouts. A few words sufficed to bring to her mind the Mosaic law of homicide, for her father had been careful t .instruct her in the sacred writings. She knew in iher heart that Asher had not willingly slain her dear father, and too well she knew her uncle's enmity to thA t unfortunate man, and with what vindictiveness Jahaz would seek, under cover of the law, his bloody death. With her grief for the slain was mlingled a ten- der fear for the father of her affianced, and on the day of Elam's return from Laish, unable to control her desire to see and comfort Bithiah and Rachel, and learn of the fate of Asher, she started up the valley towards the cot- tage. She had gone thut a short distance Irom her own home when she met the youth, Elam, who, unable to bear tie thought that she miglit believe his father a willing mur- derer, had determined to see her, explain the sad affair, and, if possible, minister to the sorrow which hle knew would encompass her.  Tle meeting was tender and tearful, and we will not invade the priiacy of their mu- tual grief andexplanations. To Nain, the youth Elaml communicated the project he had formed of visiting Jer- usalem and seeking an audience with King Solomon. It seemed to him that if the King could be informed of the facts of the case, he would at once throw over his faithful craftsman the shield of his power, and restore him safely to his afflicted family.

"Art thou sure," said Nain,' sit a look and tone of tender solicitude, "'that the journey can be safely acdeom- plished? Thou mayest even meet with'myuriinle, who, in the. bitterness of his anger, may do thee harnr.":  ' ay," replied the youth, "the law will hot let his ven- geance fall on me. Besides," he added reverently, ".the God of my fathers and of thine will protect mie. In him will I put my. trust; f'or he is a strong ald '.sure defence in every time of need." "Thou sayest well," said Nain, "but whlo will care for thps e wlho abide at home, while thou art oone? The jour- npy is long as well as dangerous." "Can I not trust them also to Him who is mighty to save?

"It can do no harm, and I have learned that Hiran is all powerful with our great and wise King. I will even do as thou sayest." In such converse as this they passed an hour, the great sorrow which had fallen ljpon their hearts keeping out all thought of themselves and their relations to each other, and then they retraced their steps. Elam's mother was next made. acquainted with his project, and although her knowledge of the laws and customs of her .people forbade any sanguine ekpectatioi of anything being accomplished thereby, yet her tender solicitude for her husband forbade her discouraginga the trial. And so his arrangements for the journey were made with all possibly celerity. We must now trace the history of the avenger for a lit- tle way, ere we visit old Deborah, and go up with the tribes to the feast of the Passover at. Jerusalem. With a cloudy brow, and a glare of malignance at the victim wlho so narrowly escaped his avenging arm, Jahaz left the judgment room of Kedish on the acquittal of Asher, As hit left the city gate, dark thoughts filled his mind, and he shook the dust from, his feet and pronounced a bitter curse against it, and against the Jewish law which had stepped, as it were, between himself and his revenge. Slowly he plodded his way back to Aldol, and arrived at t he cottage ere Nain had returned from her interview with Elam. Learning the direction she had taken, he sus- pected her intent, and, angry at thethought of her friend- ship 'to the family of Asher, determined to follow her.   A TALE OFE THE FIRST TEMPLi.    31 Eagerly pursuing the windinng patlh up the valley, he soon neared the spot where they had met, and ere he had quite reached it he heard the murmur of voices. His suspicious nature caused him t to turn aside from the path and steal- thily approach the parties holding converse, that lie might listen to what they had to say. His rage was scarcely lleld in bounds when he observed the son of Asher and the daughter of his brother seated side by side on the grass, and holding close converse. "So, so," lie muttered to himself,'"tle wolfs cub is- early in pursuit of the roe. Methinks the maid is not an unwilling listener, either. I may gain knowledge by an attentive ear." 'So saying he softly drew near them, screened from ob- servation by the intervening shrubbery which skirted the path. As he came within earshot, lie heard their conver- sation in regard to Elam's proposed visit to Jerusalem. Upon the instant he resolved to go up to the feast him- self, and dog the youth's footsteps. He had a project of his own, too, which he had long revolved'in his mind, and which could only be worked out at Jerusalem. His an- ger had been kindled against Hiram of Tyre, the Master Buildel; -because he had removed him from among the workmen in the forest of Lebanon at the request of Asher. He hal . now ing hope of obtaining the secrets promised by Hiram to those Craftsmen who should faithfully labor on the Temple until its completion and dedication, unless they could be secured by stratagem. Could he once come into possession of those secrets, he could watch his opper- tunity to wreak his vengeance on Asher, and, fleeing to. some foreign land, be enabled to make use of them for his own selfish ends.  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7765-00000019"/> 32        SIGNET OF H4IAM; ; Meditating in this wise, he qsfered Elam and Nain to ldepart without perceivpig hinl, and, full of his new pnr- )pope, he ilowly returned to the cottage.

He found Bithiah with her distaff still by hier side, although she was 'unable to use it. Her features had a settled cast of sadlness, mingled with meekness and resignation. She was greatly cheered and comforted by the news from Asher, and after communicating it, old Gideon asked: i Andt where is Elanl? I see him not." He is well, I trust," answered Bithiah, "but didst thou not meet him?

Their only son, Hiram, or Hu- ram, followed his father's trade, and when the latter died, he had, although quite young, gfiven evidence of great skill and cunning. His special delight was in ornamen- tal work, and to such excellence did he attain that lie at- tracted the attention of the King of Tyre. And when de- sired by his royal ally to send up to Jerusalem a cunning workman, remembering that he was of Jewish extraction, and that his skill was unequaled by any in the realm, the King sent Hiram up to the holy city: His mother, Debo- rah, had no taste for courts, or the lomp and circumstan- ces attending them. And so she chose to make her home among the friends of her early youth, and spend her de- clining years there, and be laid to rest in the sepulchre of her fathers. Towards her residence Elam took his way, as with scrip slung from his, shoulders, and staff in hand, he left the threshold of i dllin it his sdister's kiss and his mother's blessing.. He had resolved, in his own mind, to go there first of all, then to Jerusalem, and, on his return to Kedesh, hoping to bear with him to the lat- ter place, an order for his father's release, from the hand of King Solomon. At the close of the same day, after leaving Abdoi, dusty and tired from his unwonted jour- ney, the youth reached the little village of Naphtali, where Deborah resided. Due enquiry enabled him to find her dwelling readily. It was pleasantly situated among a   A TALE OF THE FIRST TEMPLE.      35 cluster of ialm trees, under the aumple shade of whch a number of sraelitish women, with veiled faces and pitch- ers in hand for drawing water, were resting in the shade fromr the fast sinking sun. The cottage in which Debor- ah lived was flat. roofed, and constructed partly of timber and unhewn st..ne, with a luxuriant jasmine covering the rustic lintels, and a garden, of not very large dimensions, surrounding it. As he crossed the threshold, Deborah of Geshur warlthy greeted him, and the- young mlan bowed his head and received her blessing She was a picttur- esque specimen of a true imother in Israel. I seem to see her now'as I write; her conical head-dress of white lintn, her long loose gown of course blue, girded to her waist by a girdle of Tyrian purple, her tall and almost masculine borm now bending under the weight of increasing years, and her pilgrim statff in her hand, all together set off t(, advantage a countenance in which features of far more than ordinary intelligence and power lurk behind the furrows of age. Everything within the house betokened a generous competence, and the walls were adorned with numerous specimens of the eaily handcraft of her gifted son. There were models of Tyrian vessels and urns, rich carvings in oak anl cedar and shittim wood, and curious designs in silver and gold and brass. Deborah provided her youtliful visitor with a vessel of water in which to bathe his feet, after the Eastern cus- tom, and placed before him a fiugal meal of goat's milk, cheese, and cakes; of kneaded flour. Then seating herself upon the couch by his side, she listened with interest to his history of the last three years, and when he had re-  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7765-00000021"/> 836        SIGNET OF HRAM; hearsed the tragedy of the Forest of Lebanon, and the subsequent escape of Asher to Kede:lh, she said: "And to-morrow  thou proposest going to the city of Refuge?" Elam's lips faltered as he answered, "I-] wish much to see his dear face; but-" ' Old Deborah questioned him as to the cause of his em- barrassment. -"I must tell thlee all," said he. "Ifto- mnorow finds me spared and well, I am proposing to take a longer journey ere I go to Kedesh, and on thy kind of- fices my-purpose muchb depends.  I must tell thee that I design traveling without delay to Jerusalem." At'first she wondered at so youns a traveler's anticipat- ing by several weeks the time of the Passover; but hlr look of astonishment changed to one of tenderness as she listened to the unfolding of the bold plan his filial ten- derness had prompted him to. folrm. Elamn minutely ex- plained all to her, and showed how his sole chance for success depended upon the influence. which her'son Hi- rain would be likely to possess over King Solomon. Con- siderations of safety for him ponompted her at frst to urge a delay upon him until the thousands of Israel should be crowding the thoroughlfares to the Holy City. But his youthful ardor ciould not brook delay, and old; Debo- rah was not one to check the brave and generous resolve. And so she set. herself to secure for him a safe conduct 'to Jerusalem in company with the band of Levites and Shepherds who were going up with flocks for the sacri- fice. .On the morning of his departure she gave him such directions as were nrecessary, and tilled his serip with   A TALE OF THE FIRST TEMPLE.    37 what she 'thought he would most need on the journey. On lbidding him farewell and Godrspeed, she drew .from her finger a ring of Tyrian, w!prkmanship, on which wer:e engraved her: initials, and those of her distinguished son. It was te; Signegt of Hirarm, the artificer "There," said she, as she: placedi it in his posssion; "this will be a token between my son and thee, and be- tween me and thee. It .my open to' thee many iiiendly dorla on thy way, and give thee access to the heart and, home of my only child."            " And so the young mountainier of Lebanon, glad at heart, and -filled with gatitude. to the God of Israel who had thus far prospered him on' hii way, set olut, with high hopes, on the road to Jerusalem.  That  e afternoon found our young traveler and his com- panions gliding smo6thly, along overi the still' Waters of the' Lake of Gennesaiet, thenh known as the Sea of Chin - nereih. -They entered it at the junction of the iiver Jor- dan, whose banks were of rich pasture grounds, occupied by the tfocks and herds of a somewhat sparse population.

It was, as we have written, in the spring time, "and the voice of the turtle was heaid n the  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7765-00000022"/> 38         SIGNET OF HRAM; land." The company, too, were joyous and lighlt-hearted as the spring time around thenm, for were they not on the way to celebrate the feast of the Passoiver, and were not their eyes to he gladdened by beholding the Holy e City, the piide of the Jewish nation? And now and again they broke forth in soue song 'of Zionlike this: ' i Hotiw amiable are thy tabiernacles, O Lord of :oats, My' soul longeth, yea,' even faiiiteth, for the coirts of the Lord. : .;: My heart and my fleshcrieth out for the living God,: Blessed are they that dwell in thy house, they will be still praising thee!" Reaching the southern exttremity of thel Lake, they en- camped, in their goat's-hair tents, on the banks of Jordan. And now' young Elan   beleld a, sight which. stirred his boyish enthusiasm to the highest pitch, notwithstanding the,heavy bu'rden on his heart.  Over the sparkling wa- ters,. in silvery stateliness, rose the moon which 7preceded the full Passover one, tipping the stately palms withfrin- ges of silver, which vied in brightness with the iwhite tents of the pilgrims. Together then they turned theii faces towards Jerusalem and chanted: "I will lift up. mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help; My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth.'. ,He will not suffer thy foot to be moved'; he that keepeth thee will not slumber, Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither sluinber'nor'sleqp '! And so they retired to rest.  But not long were they allowed to sleep, for under the clear moon and soft air the night was the minot favorable time for travrl, and they could repose during the heat of the noonday.

The surroundings of the city corresponded with the magnificence within its. walls. Where the waters of the brook Kedron flowed; murmilingly thlrough the rocky dell at the foot of the Mount of Olives, royal gardens were laid out with every variety of tree and flower. The vale of Hinnom, with its gently undulating slopes, bounded the city on the south, while the Mount of Olives, with its triple summit and dense groves, towered above all the rest, and looked down on a combination of glories at its base to which no spot on earth could afford a parallel. It would be strange indeed if one who possessed the fervid imagination of the: young Elam had failed to be struck with the picture which lay before him. As he neared the city, the first object of interest to his eyes was the great Temple, then drawing towards its completion. Filial affection gave it, for him, a still deeper interest; for in that wondrous pile were timbers felled and fashion- ed by his father on the 'heights of Lebanon, and that father now languished in a strange city, a prisoner to the law. But not long did he 'allow gloomy thoughts to cloud his brow. One building he discerned of dimensions more vast than any other. It occupied a commanding elevation, and flanked with buttresses, and separated by trees and an enclosure front the surrounding edifices. This Was the spot he sought; here were the gates he most desired to enter. It was the palace of David the minstrel King, and here King Solomon held his court. Elaln had received instructions from his traveling companions as to where Hiram of Tyre was to be found, and directed his  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7765-00000024"/> 42  .      SIGNEs T OF HRAM; steps to a spot near the place, where a building had been set apart for his use. But the labors of the day were over, and Hilram had retired to his private residence in the little village pf Bethaniy hard by. He chose to abide here that he might be away from the throng of workmen, and near to the clay grounds of the Jordan, where tile pillars of the porch and the holy vessels of the Temple were cast. Alilthough wearied and toil-worn, thither did Elam direct his steps. As 'he descended by the eastern gate of the Temnl!e, tthe fast dcclining sun was pouring a flood of glory over tihe mountains around the city. He crossed the Kedron and skirted the mountain close by Gethsemane, and reaching the crest of Olivet, he paused to survey the most striking scene his eyes had ever be- held. Around him  were scattered groups of the olive tree, with here and there the oleander and the wild al- nond. The Kedron's usually scanty flood was now swel- led by the rains of spring, and ran tumbling and brawling below. Stretching to the left was the Valley of Hinnom, whose northern slope was surmountedby the walls of the city of David, and the loftier towers of the royal palace. immediately in front, on the opposite side of the valley of the brook Kedron; was the crowning glory of all, the Tem- ple, withits spacious courts and colonades. He beheld the vast wall, with its almost incredible stones, which rose on the southern side of Mt. M oriab,. He saw, too, Jachin and Boaz, the pillars,of the Porch, which stood glitterin before him, with their capitals of lily work, let-work, and pomegranaat. 'They had recently been set eup and stood there, like golden sentinels, to guard the sacred precincts.   A TALE OF THE FIRST TEMPLE.     43 It was twilight when he reached Bethany, and he lost no time in making inquiry for the dwelling of Hiram. It was easily found; and 'the signet ring gained him ready. almnission. In a brief space of time he stood in the pres- ence of the Master' Builder. * Hiram of Tyre was then a man, in middle life, rather below the ordinary statute. Upon his head he wore a crimson cap or turban, of such' size as to partially conceal a broad and capacious fore- head. Hte was reclining on a couch by a table covered with rolls of papyrus and parchment, which were spread out before him, and which lie was examining by the light of .seven branched lamp of curious workmanship. Dispersed throughout the :chamber were many rare specimens of Tyrian handcraft, draperies of purple, jars, vases, flagons, and the floor was of the celebrated checker- ed pavement which had then only been used in the dwel- ling of kings and princes.- He greeted'Elam kindly, and his fine eyes kindled at sight of the signet ring, for it carried him back in memory to the side of his mother Deb- oral, for.'whom he entertained t.e most unbounded af- fection. His heart was full of kind emotions, and- he lis- tened with much interest to 'the tale of the young moun- taineer.  After some time spent in familiar converse, a couch was spread for our young traveler, and Hiram of Tyre invited him to share a draught of the red wine of Engeddi, mingled with the juice of the pomegranate. The toil-worn feet of the youth were refreshed .with a cooling bath, and then he retired to rest. When the Master Build- er awoke early next morning, Elam, fatigued by his un- wonted journey, still slept.  He left him in charge of his &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7765-00000025"/> "        SIGNET OF HRAM; wife and children, and repaired 'to his. rooms near the King's Palace. The boy's tale had made a deep impres- sion on Hiram's mind, and his kindly nature, no less than the commands of his mother, as expressed in sending to him the Signet, prompted him to do what hecould to fur- ther the lad's bold effort at speech with King Solomon. To- an ordinary person, access to the King was difficult to be obtained. But by virtue of his high office, Hiram of Tyre not unfrequently held long personal interviews with Solomon; yet, not to him, even, were the doors of the palace open at all times, and he was too well acquainted with court etiquette to venture on an unwarrantable lib- erty. However, 'he lad not long to wait for a favorable opportunity to introduce the story and name of the young Hebrew. Solomon being that day absent at his summer place at Heshbon, his Chief Chamberlain availed himself of the opportunity to visit the Tyrian artificer and exam- ine the numerous specimens of -his wondrous skill with which his iooms abounded. To him the story was relat- ed. The royal servant listened with an appareni apathy which gave Hiram little promise of encouragement; and what the chamberlain did say confirmed him in his fears that there was no probability of any relaxation in the Jewish law relating to bloo&amp;-revenge. But the official had been more inteiested in the tale than his manner showed. That vei'y night, on the King's return lie intro- duced the matter as a subject of conversation, while they were seated in the banquet hall. Solomon, ever alive to the dlaims of the suffering and the'destitute, and capable of more than most of his dependent courtiers of appreciating   A rALE OF THE FIRST TEkMPLE.     45 filial tenderness. and worth, resolved to see the youth with his own eyes, and ]himself hear and determine his cause. So the delay of a day, which fretted Elarn very 'much, proved to him of' great benefit in the end, and he passed thie second night of his stay with Hiram in plea- sant dreams of home and liberty for his father. CHAPTE R, VI. The nmagnificent palace. of King Solomon contained a vast .Hall which was called "The House of the Forest of Lebanon." The ceiling was of great height, and beauti- fully adorned with draperies of blue and purple hungo from golden cornices which were supported thy pillars of marble. The walls were enameled with parti-colored stones interspersed with warlike devices. Trophies of the battles of King David, the spears, helmets, and swords, taken from his enemies, were grouped here and there,. and arranged on marble pedestals were golden vessels, interspersed with shields and hehlets of beaten gold. Massive rafters of cedar, suDported )b cedar pillars, and adorned by devices of silver and gld, added lmudc to tle grandeur of the room.

On this; magnificent seat sat the King, fully robed, on the morning when Elam was to be brought into the royal presence. 1Right regally was he attired. His raiment glittered witl gems, a tiara of untold richi- ness was on his bead, and bracelets of gold were on lis neck arnd arms. ,In crimson and gold stood about the throne the officers of his court, and near were groups of the princes and nobles of the people, mingled withl priests and Levites in official attire, who had come to pay liom- age or seek an audience with the King. Behind the throne, in triple rows, clad in Tyrian purple and armed with bow and quiver, stood the royal body-guard, ther long, jet ringlets of hair falling over their shoulders, and sparkling with gold-dust. Such was the scene at the nlmoment when young Elam was introduced and escorted to the foot of the throne where he knelt in lowly obeisance to Ihis King, and kissed the white marble steps of the tilrone.. Hiram's wife had replaced his soiled and travel-stained garments by a grace- ful tunic, and as le knelt and bent low before the King his long black locks swept over his agitated face, and -on- trasted pleasingly with the snow-white marble on which he was prone. All eyes were directed towards him as the King, addressing the chamberlain, said: "So this, then, is the young mountain courier?" "It is, O King," replied lie. "Rise up, child of'Lebanon-rise, and fear not;" said the King. "I have heard of the heroislm of thy young spirit;   A TALE OF -THE FII'lST TEMPLE.    47 it was worthy of a more hopeful cause. Howfar hast thou traveled on this errand of mercy?" l"It' is two weeks, O King, since thy servant left his home,: and nothing but love for the kindest of fathers could give me courage to stand in thy presence." "Thy father is where?" 5 "He hath taken refuge in thy Refuge City of. Kedesh," said Elam, the tearls stealing down his cheeks as he spoke. "Taken refuge there from the avenger of blood? Tell me, brave youth," said the King, "come fnearer and tell me of the event which led to this separation." Thus encouraged, Elam detailed, in tremulous accents, the'tragedy on Mt. Labanon, and wlen he had finished le cast an imploring look on the monarch. A tear moisten- ed the eye of the King as he said: "Hark thee, brave boy, thy her'oism desetrvth every mark of r6yal favor, and it shall not go unrequited. But-". Elam's heart sank as le marked the hesitatingly spoken wxord, and said, with energy: "It was the thought of my lhart, ', m0ighty King, that thy word is'the .word of God.

Elam bowed once more to the gYroulnd, and then wi'th many strange and mingled feelings he hastened from the palace gate .and paused not until he reached once more the house of his kind friend Hiram. Here, seated on his couch, the tears of sorrow and disappoin tmeiit coursing down his cheeks, he related to the wife oftlhe artificer the inci- dents of his interview.- When he had finished his tale the good woman did her best to comfort the youtl, bidding him put his trust in Him who is mighty to save. She also reminded him that it was the eve of-the Pa ssQver, and hade him consider himself a part of the family until its close. Then, her husband having meantime returned, she proceeded, according to the instructions of the Jewish   A TALE OF THE FIRST TEMPLE.     49 ritual, to cast .out thce unleavened bread. All over the house, witk a lighted lamp she went, strictly examining the smallest corner or hole where it was possible for  6 leaven, in any shape, to be lodged. The next morning, before noon, all that could be found was carefully burned, or thrown into the water, or scattered to the wind; and every one, as he thus put it away, was accustomed to re- peat the established form of execration, "All the heaven that is within my possession, which I have seen or which I have not seen, which I have cast out or which I have not cast out, be it as though it were notl be it as the dust. of the earthl"' Thus was every house purged for the cele- bration of the passover; and after this it was not consid- ered proper even so much as- to make use of the word leaven, lest the thought of it should pollute the mind. The  illeavened bread which was now prepared for use, was baked in the form of thin cakes, full of holes, to keep them frohi the slightest fermentation, unseascned with salt, and made only with water, without any sort of oil; in some cases the higher class of the people had them en- riched with sugarl and eggs though even such bread was not allowed on the first day of the feast, but only on those that followed. The lambs were all slain, as other sacrifices, in the Court of the priests. It was a great work to kill and dress so many as were necessary .for the occasion, and required a considerable part of the-afternoon of the 14th day for its execution. The Evening Sacrifice accordingly, on that day, was offered before the middle of the afternoon, and the rest of the day, from that time to the end of it, was  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7765-00000028"/> 50         SIGNET OF HRAM; occupied altogether with tlis preparation for the passover. Though only one person .of each family or society entered into the court of sacrinice with the lamb that belonged to it, it needs not to be remarked, that it was still impossible for all these to go in at once,' They were accordingly divided into three large companies, which were admitted one at a time in succession. When one of these com- panies entered, the gates were closed, and immediately the owners of the lambs, or those who brought them in, began to assist each other in killing them, taking off their skins, and removing the entrails and fat. The blood was han- ded to the priests, to be sprinkled on the altar and poured out at its bottom, and the common portions of fat to be burned upon its top ; these standing all along in rows from the slaughtering places to the altar, and passing the arti- cles'from one to another continually to where it stood. Meanwhile the Levites sang over, once, twice, or three times, the 113th, 114th, l15thl, 116th, 117th, and 118th Psalms. These were denominated, when taken together, the Hallel or hymn of 'praise, and sometimes the- Lesser Hallel, to distinguish it from, another that was in use, styled the greater Hallel. As soon as the first ccmpany had their work done, they went out, and the second took their place, going over the same business in the 'same style; so in their turn, the third one filled the court; after Which it was all washed over with water, as we may well suppose it needed to be after such an immense slaughter. The lambs thus butchered were carried away to the sev- eral houses where they were to be eaten, and immediately made ready for roasting, by being thrust through from '                *  s   A TALE OF Th' I FIRST TEMPLE.    51 one end to the other, by a wooden spit or stake, and so placed before a lalge fire. According to the command- mlent, each was allowedT to be thus exposed, till it was roastedl in a perfectly thorough manner. Soon after it be- came dark, that is, with the commencement of the 15th day, the passover table was spread, and surrounded by its little company, ih all the houses of Jerusalem.  The supper commenced with the ceremony of drinking a small cup of wine mingled with water, after having given thanks over it to God the Giver of all blessings. Every one had a separate cup poured out, but only one uttered the thanksgiving in the name of all. This was the first cup. Then followed the washing ofhands, after. the manner of thee purifying of the Jews, accompanied with another short form of thanksgiving to God. The table having beeni till this time unfurnished, was now sup- plied with its provisions, viz: 'the cakes of unleavened bread, the bitter salad, the;lamb roasted whole, with its legs, heart, liver &amp;c., and, besides, some other meat prepa- red from the flesh of common peace offerings, that had been presented during the day, and a dish of thick sauce composed of dates, eggs, raisin., vinegar, &amp;c. The table thus furnished, the leading person, and all the rest after him, took a small quantity of the salad, with an- other thanksgiving and ate it. After which, immediately, all the dishes were removed from the table, and a second cup of wine placed before each of the company, as at first. The strange way of beginning the meal was designed to excite the curiosity of the children, that they might be led to inquire what it meant, according to what is said in  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7765-00000029"/> 52        SIGNET OF HRAlM; Ex. xii. 26. When the inquiry was nilade, (for if there was" no child present, the wife or some other person brought it forward,) the person who presided began and told how their fathers had all been servants in Egypt, and how with many signs and wonders the Lord had redeemed them from their cruel bondage, and brought them forth from the place of their cruel opipression, with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. As he concluded the in- teresting story of Jehovah's mercies, the dishes that had been removed were again placed upon the table; where-  upon he said, "This is the passover which we eat, because that the Lord passed over the houses of our fathers in Egypt;" and then holding up the salad, and after it the unleavened bread, he stated their design, viz: that the one represented the bitterness of the Egyptian bondage, and the other the sudden redemption which tthe Lord wrought on their behalf, when he smote the first-born of their op- pressors, so that they urged his people to depart without delay. Then he repeated the 113th and 114th Psalms and closed with this prayer: "Blessed-be thou, O Lord our God, King Everlasting; wlo hast: redeemed. our fathers out of Egypt, and brought us to this night to eat unleav- ened bread and bitter herbs;" which bging 'utered, all the companyl rank the wine that had been standing for some time before them.

Another washing of the hands now took place, when the person who presided, taking up the unleavened bread, broke one of the cakes in two, again gave thanks to God, and then, with the rest, began to eat; each first Inaking use of a piece of bread, with some. of the salad, and the   A TALE OF THE FIRST TEMPLE.      53 thick sauce, thein partakinl of the peace offering meat, and last of all of the paschlal lamb, with a selarat6 thanks- ;iviltr still plro1nounced before each dish.

This was the third cup and was called by way of distinction, 'thell (i) cof blessing," because while it stood before them ready to be drunk. the leader was accustomed to return tlianks over it inl a particular manner, for the blessing of the sacred supper, and for all the goodness of the Lord. Thlere was yet anothler cup made ready a little time after, just before the company rose fro'm the table. It was de- nominated the cup of the Hallel; because it was the cus- tom to repeat, in connection with it, the principal part of the hymn of Lesser Hallel; for as it was begun by the re- hearssal of its first two psalms, thoe 113th and the lltth, over the second cup, (as we have seen,)so it was now tin. ished bly 'being carried on through the following four.

Jerusalem had more than one visitor from the valley of Abdol during the Passover week. The footsteps of Elam lad been dogged during his entire journey from his Lebanon home to the walls of the Sacred City. Jahaz the Avenger, had. for reasons best known to himsilf, kept the youth in sight, determined, if possible, to know some- thing of his plans and purposes, if so be he might, by the aid of that knowledge, yet accomplish his bloody purpose of slaying Asher. While the latter remained in the Ref- uge City, Jahaz did not dare attempt to slay him, but he hoped to devise some plan to inveigle him without the gates of the city, and there and then accomplish his fell purpose. He knew the object of Elam's visit to the King, and on the day of his audience he lingered in disguise about the palace gates, He saw by the youth's sorrow- ful countenance as he passed out from Solomon's presence that his mission had been 'unsuccessful, and therefore he bad no further. need to keep up his espionage so closely. He had other work to do, and he set about it at once. That night, in' a lonely I near Kedron brook, and hard by the city, there was a lengthened consultation be- tween a small band of craftsmen from the Temple and this arch villian.. They were Tyrians whom Jahaz had known in years gone by, and whom he had sought out on his arnrval at Jerusalem, and privately summoned them 4o me-et him there. Like himself they were men of no   A TALIE OF THE FIRST TEMPLE.      55 princijple, and rilpe f)or any evil deed. They went to the rendezvous singly, so as not to attract attention, and alr- riving one y one were informed by their self-constituted chief of his plans. From seafaring men he had heard glowing accounts of the wealth of Egypt and Ethiopia, and his plan was to organize a band of desperate men, seize a ship, and proceeding thither, lead a life of lawless- ness and ease. "Brothers," said he, "why toil ye here for a pittance of corn and wine, with taskmasters over ye, when ease and luxurJ may be had for a trifling effort? Ye were told in fair words that great secrets should be yours if ye would but serve the Jewish King for a season. Ye have toiled now these many years, and what thank have ye? Will the word of Hiran be kept! I tell ye nay. "But,' said one, "thete is yet a chance to obtain fromr the Master that for which we have wrought. Let us wait until the Temple is completed, then, with the secrets of a Master in our possession, we shall be able to travel in foreign countries at our will." "Aye," said the third, "there is wisdom in that, brother Jahaz; we must have the secret wlrd of a Master-it will open to us gates we may not otl, rwitse be able to unlock .

'Do. ye not remember the words of the promise? 'Upon them only which are worthy and well qualified will I be- stow the the new )awme,' said the Master; and who but himself is to be the 'Judge? I fear me, brother Jahaz, we are as little like to obtain the word as thou art.".* "There is but one way to obtain it," said Jahaz, refiec- tively. "Who knows the courageof Hiram of Tyre?  Methinks it were an easy matter to extort the secret from him. The pampered favorites of courts are not apt to be overstocked with bravery." "But what wouldst thou do," 'aid the first speaker, "if he boldly withstood thee and bluntly refused thy demand?' "Then, by my beard," said Jahaz. "I wouldl strangle himl as one would choke to death a blind puppy. He ha1 twice crossed miy path already-let him beware of thel third time." But we need not tarry longer with these midnight con- spirators. What the result of their confabulation was we shall see ere the close of our story. CHAPTER VIII. On a pleasant afternoon, near the close of the Passover month, old Deborah of Geshur beheld, at a distance, the   A TALE OF THE FIRST TEMPLE.     57 figure she had been long expecting and wishing to see. Day after day she had been seated by her distaff, close by the lattice, looking for the return of ydung Elam. Occa- sionally she would venture out with her crooked staff to the middle of the road, and gaze with her dim old eyes for some appearance of the expected traveler. More than willingly had her son Hiram prolonged his hospitality to the lad until the solemnities of the Passover were conclud- ed and Elam had thereby the advantage of enjoying on his return homewards the company of some of his fellow- worshippers. He availed himself of their society all the way through the great valley of the Jordan until they arrived at the waters of Merom, where a foot-path di- verged from the highway, conducting to the house of De- borah. Gratified indeed was he to find himself once more an inmate ofher residence. With pleased interest she listened to the incidents he had to narrate of Hiram,. the Temple, the King. He delivered into her hands, also, a 3parcel sent by her son, containing Egyptian linen and a copy of the Pentateuch, and he returned to her hands the valued ring which had served him so well. "'And Israel's many thousands," said old Deborah, as Elam paused in his narrative, "are they faithful as ever to the holy convocation?" "Yea, truly. Never can I forget that scene. Thy son and myself were wont at times to stand, on our return to Bethany, on the ridge of Olivet, and watch the multitudes threading their way through the valleys and plains-the music of their voices bomne on the evening breeze, their songs swelling louder as they caught a first glimpse of the  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7765-00000032"/> 58        SIGNET OF HRAM; city of our God. And on the night of the Passover, when returning .from-the holy service under a clear moon, and ' looking down the valley of Kedron, thousands of white tents dotted the mountain sides and the hum from the city was like the noise from a restless sea." "Sawest tho ththe anointed of Jehovah, the high priest of Israel?" '"I did,-a venerable old inan with a snowy beard and tottering step. I saw, too, his breast-plate glittering with its precious stones, his robe of blue, embroidered with purple and scarlet, and the golden bells." - "The blessing of Jehovah be on him, my son, I rejoice. to hear thy testimony. But I see thou art weary with this journey. Thy couch is spread, and ready. It is needful to betake thyself to rest." Exhausted with the fatigues of his travel, Elam willing- ly acquiesced, and be did so more readily as he" had re- solved to renew his journey on the morrow. He could not linger, when a few hours more travel would take him to Kedesh, and place him face to face with his belovdl -father. 'So the next forenoon found him on his way. At mid-day he paused by the banks of Jordan, and was fer- ried across to the other side on a rude raft, with another traveler whom he had observed for some time behind him. The latter sat on the raft muffled in a loose tunic, and wore a cap which almost entirely covered his features. He had a basket slung by his side, containing trinkets of various kinds, which seemed to indicate the nature of his supportin his wandering life. Elam was too much engrossed with the thought that in   A TALE OF THE FIRST TEMPLE.     59 a few hours he should stand in the presence of his father to notice his fellow-traveler. But there was something striking and singular in the man's countenance and man- ner; when he did speak, the tones of his voice, proceeding fronm beneath a long, flowing, grizzly beard, seemed not altogether unfamiliar; and the boy could not fail to re- mark the penetrating glances from time to time cast upon him from eyes that were screened bybushy eyebrows,which gave an appearance that, to say the least, was not at all prepossessing. Arrived at the opposite bank, Elam paid his fare, and was adjusting his sandals to resume his jour- ney, when the stranger, in a rough and unmusical voice inquired if he were going to Kedesh, and offered, if he were a stranger, to be his guide and companion. The youth could not help being struck with the singular and assumed familiarity of the Jew. He seemed as kind as one of his stern voice and manner could be, and yet there was a dissembled effort to get Elam to inform him of his own history and that of his family, where he had been, and what had caused one so young to take so long a journey.  Such an impression did his disingenuous manner produce that the boy was really pleased when,. on their reaching a village some distance from Kedesh, the- stranger announced that he would tarry there, and leave him to complete his journey alone. Our young traveler obtained easy access within the gates of the refuge city, and had little difficulty in finding the dwelling of Asher of Abdol. The visions of Jerusalem's magnificence were floating before his mind's eye, as he climbed, with trembling heart the dark and winding ,               *^ .   &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7765-00000033"/> 60        SIGNET OF H IAM; stairs, and 'marked the painful contrast. A tap at the door was answered by the music of a well known vcice bidding him enter and in a moment father and son were clasped in each otler's arms. CHAPTER Ix. Tie joy of father and son at their re-union was mutual. In broken accents Asher gave thanks to the God of Israel for raising him up so trusty and well formed a son. "And how," said he, "didst thou leave my other dear ones? Thy mother and thy tender sister, and old Gideon-are they well?" The youth blushed and stammered-his father knew not of his recent journey. At length he asked, "Hast thou not seen old Gideon lately, then?" "Nay," said Asher, 'The good old man hath tarried long 'with thee this. season. I have been waiting eagerly for his return. How fareth it with him?" "Well, for aught I know," replied the boy. "I have not seen him for many weeks. I must tell thee I have been keeping the feast at Jerusalem." "At Jerusaleml" exclaimed Asher. "And yet I thought as much. It is well-would that I could have been with thee to tell thee of. the many things thou shouldst knowin regard to the holy feast."   A TALE OF THE FIRST TEMPLE.     61 Elam explained that his home while at the Passover had been with Hiram of Tyre, who had, with fatherly care, considered himl as one of his own household. He then narrated the interview with King Soloffion, and with bit- ter tears lamented the failure of his mission. But his father comforted him, saying, with much emotion, that he would willingly suffer ten su'ch separations to feel that he had such a son.. Their busy converse was soon interrupted by-footsteps without the door, and the well-known tap of  a pilgrim's staff: "Enter thou holy man of God," said Asher. And as old. Gideon's tottering ;teps crossed the threshold he added, with his greeting: "Thou couldst not have come at a more fitting moment. -How can I be lonely with the aged friend of my adversity and the child of my fondest affection both at my sile?" "The Lord be with thee!', said the old man, in a faint voice, "and with thee, too, my son!" observing with his dim old eyes the form of Elam a moment after., Then*he sank exhausted upon a couch-the journey had been too too much for his feeble fiame. A little water revived him, and in haste they prepared a comfortable bed for him, hoping a few hours repose would recruit his exhausted energies. But all at once he. made an attem pt to raise himself from his pillow on his withered arm. "Hark ye!" he exlaimed, with unwonted force; "the days of Gideon of Zaphar are numbered--my sands of life are run out. 1 shall soon be gathered to my fathers. Four score and ten years have I been a pilgrim on the earth, and now that I am passing away but one thing do I de- sire.

He paused as if to gath er his remaining. strength, and then he continued: "One word ere this tongue falters and this slow beating hearl ceases forever its pulsations. Beware1 Let Asher keel faithfully within the walls of Kedesh. His enemy the avenger, lurks without. Moreover, let the boy Elam has. ten without delay to the protection of his mother." These broken sentences struck Elarn with much force tending as they did to confirm suspicions that before now had flashed upon him as to the stranger who had dogged his footsteps from the home of old Deborah. "Does Jahaz, then, lurk outside the city walls?" he en- quired in a suppressed tone. "He crossed the Jordan with thee to-day, my son. Hasten! hasten to thy home; his hardness of heart may lead him to fearful deeds." "And must we see thy face no more, good father?" said Asher to the dying prophet. "We shall meet in a better country, myson," said old Gideon. -"Lo! I am nearing the gates-the gates of the true City of Refuge; angels are beckoning me- glorious King of Kings, I come! Glory-glory!" and old Gideon of Zaphar closed his dim eyes on earth to open them in the new Jerusalem above. The tidings quickly spread through Kedesh that the wanderer had gone home. As was customary in Israel on such solemn occsions, the matrons of the city who had en- joyed his friendship and prized his worth, gathered about his death-bed to bewail a patriarch in Israel, and to em- balm his body with aloes, myrrh, and spices. For two   A TALE OF THE FIRST TEMPLE.     (3 When tihe aged Gideon had breathed his last, Elam has- tended his preparations, at the request of his fathler to re- turn to his Lebanon home. The mysterious allusions of the old' man to the necessity of sutcha step showed him the propriety of leaving old Gideon's Kedesh friends to the care of his obsequies. Before his departure he arranged as to the day when the mournful funeral proces sion might be sxpeeted in the valley of Abdol, and em- bracing his fattier, he took his staff and scrip and has- tened on his way to his mother and sister. On reahing the cottage, he soon discovered the cause of his old fr'iend's urgency.

He looked de- jected and sad, and told me he was to. sail that evening for Cyprus, never to return." "And canst thou not tell me more of him?  "Alas! that I can," continued he, in a inelancholy voice. I heard but yesterday ofhls fate. The vessel in whichlle sailed encountered a storm the very next day;off the coast of Phenecia, and was wrecked. All on board perished." Bithiah, was completely deceived, and in the fullness of her simplicity, she detailed the storyof tie tragedy in the mountains of Lebanon. He seemed to listen with pro- found interest, and as she concluded, le said: "I feel glad in the thought that a lonely wayfarer hath been permitted to bear to thee glad tidings. "Dost thou mean," said Bithiah, "that now my husband may return from the Refuge City? would it were so," she exclaimed, with clasped hands. "It would be perfectly safe," said the dissimulator, "as thy servant can testify. Jahaz told me, as a reason for his self-banishment, that he was the last of his race, and had. no tieto bind him longer to this land. If there be no other kinsman to take the place of the avenger thy husband may return with impunity." "Joyful day would it be to this heart," said Bithiali and tears of gratitude shone in her eyes. B"Hast thou," said he, "any messenger to carry tidings to thy husband?" "I have a little son," she replied, "whose return I am daily looking for. When he comes back I shall-but stay, I have a trustier messenger still: an aged man, Gid-   A TALE ,OF THE FIRST TEMPLE.      65  eon of Zalhar is with ,ne. I expect him every moment. To him will I entrust the cheering message." - At this the traveler arose and bidding her adieu started on his Journey. No sooner had old Gideon  returned than Bithiah, with trembling eagerlness, narrated the tidings she had just received. He at once sa'w the cruel deception that had been practiced on her, and divined its object. "Nay," said he, "believe it not. The information of old anid faithful Gideon is more to be relied on than that of a nameless wanderer. Take my word for it, Jahaz still lives. As thou valuest the safety of Asher, wait the Lord's time, and lie will continue that grace which has supported thee hitherto." And now he felt that he must hasten to warn Asher of his impending danger-Without the walls of Kedesh he had seen the avenger. The journey, as we have seen, was his last. His eagerness had over-taxed his already feeble frame, and, his life-work done, he was taken to his final rest. CHAPTER X. In a deep dell within a stone's throw of the Lebanon cottage of Asher, concealed amid copse and brushwood, and reached by a difficult and intricate path which led through masses of disjointed rock, was the burying-place,  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7765-00000036"/> "     .  SIGNET OF HRAM; the sepulcher of the house of Asher. It was a cave hol- lowed out of the precipice. A huge stone closed its mouth, secured in its place by iron bars and bolts. This was the chosen resting place of old Gideon of Zaphar. It was on a bright evening in the month of Zif, when the sun was casting his last beams athwart the valley' of Abdol, imparting a solemn and sombre glory to the beautiful summer tints around, when a strange and un- wonted sound of wailing lamentation was heard disturb- ing the quiet of that sequestered spot. By-and-by a slow' procession was seen winding by themargin of the stream, making towards the sepulcher. It was the body of the, old prophet, which was being borne with all thel pomp and pageantry of an ancient Jewish funeral occasion The bier was, carried on the shoulders of some aged men who were attired in white robes. Tley were citizens of Kedesh, the city where Gideon had passed so many of the' years of his long and useful life. Numercus mourners were in the train, gatheied fr om the remotest corners of the province to pay a last tribute to the departed, Otl-' ers there were who were i'esidents of the valley and slopes of Lebanon to whomn the old man was well-known for hbi unwearied kindness and his sympathyshown to the house of Asher. Among them were the wood-cutters who, a year and a half before, had stood before the gates of Ked- esh, and in the judgment hall at the trial of the unfortu- nate man-slayer. Elam was there, too, and leaning on his arm the tottering form of his mother, her sightless eyes filled with tears. And yet another was there. Sta- tioned on a rocky ledge, just at the mouth of the cave   A TALE OF THE FIRST TEMPlLE.    OU was the venerable mother of Hiram of Tyre, old Deboiah of Geshur. She was clad in a large woolen cloak, and in her hands she held her pilgrim's staff. Her form, once erect and finely moulded, was now bent with age, and as she stooped over the entrance she seemed likely indeed to bs the next for whom the daughters of Israel should take up the lamentation. Until now the cries of the hired mourners had been heard loud in their wailings, but as the body approached the sepulchre their voices suddenly ceased, and the pro-  cession halted. Then in tones of wild and thrilling elo- quence arose the voice of old Deborah: '"Men of Judah," she said, "daughters of Israel-a mighty cedar of Lebanon has fallen! The forest is this day trembling for the blank! Many are those his. branches have sheltered; many weak ones have encamped under them, and the lowering tem- pest touched them not!

They deposited their burden in a rude niche hollowed out of the rock, and thenl having iolled the stone'to the door, and thus , cuemted the mouth of the cave, the nmournirs quietly dispersed. Slowly the months passed on, and again the peaks of Lebanon were whitened with. snow. Weary were the days and ninghts to the unwilling sojourner in Kedlesh and thrice weary to them who so .sadly missed his pleselc( in the cottage home at Abdol. Spring calme again w;tlh its bright sunshine, its verdure, its bursting- buds and open- ing flowers, and its choruses of bird voices in forest antl grove, still' the work in forest and quarry and on Mounlt Moriah went on, and the Tempie was well-nigh tinished.

One day sufficed for his preparations for return. With what strange and painful interest did he mark every part of the road which under the saddest cir- cumstances,. he had once before traveled! The little bridge where he paused; the recks which were now covered with verdure; the lambs on -the heights above sporting by the side of the shepherd; the voice of the- turtle sounding loud above the chorus of the singing birds which arose from the copse. The journey which, when a breathless fugitive, he performed in a few hours, now required more time. His strength was impaired by confinement, and fatigue com- pelled hii to make frequent pauses. On attaining the extremity of the valley of Abdol he resolved to rest until the heat of the day was past. Reclining under a spreading tree, upon a grassy bank, his pilgrim staff beside him, he fell into a gentle slumber, and was dreaming of home and loved ones, when he was awakened by a gentle pressure upon his forehead. A figure bent over him-he opened his eyes, and one glance sufficed for recognition. His daugh- ter Rachel rained kisses upon his brow and lips, and bro- ken words were stammered forth, "my father! my fatherl" Leaning on his daughter's arm, the remainder of his jour- ney was' lightened, and soon he stood once more on his own threshold. We will not describe the meeting with his' household-such scenes are to solemn for our pen.

It was the sixth year since the work of erecting the Temple thegan, ,and one more season, it was thought, would complete the sacred edifice. To this time Asher looked with pleasing anticipations, for the favorable notice of his sovereign had been bestowed 'on him, and after the dedication he expected to receive the secrets of a Master workman from Hiram of Tyre, by which his position in the craft would 'be materially en- hanced. - He had served with freedom, fervency, and zeal; to him it was a labor of love to toil in erecting the House of the Lord, but yet he yearned- for the mysterious knowl- edge of the Dyonisians of whom Hiram wais chief- All those who should hold out faithful to the end of seven years had been promised this added knowledge, and all were 'eager to receive it. And while Asher thus lovingly labored and patiently waited for the completion of the Temple, how was .it with Jahaz.?

Agairn i e 'wended 'his way fi omn Abdol to Jerusalem. The quiefit ]prsuit of a lherds- man did not suit hil--he must meet agrain the turbulent spirits that he had associated with at the feast of the Pass- over, and who were as ripe fior deeds of violence, and as eager for lawless pleasure as himself. As 'he passes with- in the city gates we lose sighlt of him'-better had it been for him could he but 'lave lost himself as easily and ef- fectually as he now passes from our sight. Slowly and quietly the summer time passed away, and winter following, gave place to spring. The heart of the nation beat with joy, for there remained but little labor to be done ere the Temple would be. ready for the great- day,'  the day of dedication. -But who can tell what a day may bring forth? . We go to our couches at nilght in the confi- dent expectation that "to-morrow will be as this day, and 'much more abundant," but to our eyes that morrow may never dawn. What a sad lesson of the mutability of life was that our ancient brethren learned on, one bright spring day of this seventh year of the'Temple! Yesterday they were in perfect order, to-day -they are gathered in, groups about the work, tumultuously discussing scme subject of absorbing interest. The time draws nigh for the daily in- spection of the work by the' King, but none note the ap- proach. of the august monarch until with his body-guard he appears in their midst. Amazement and anger are man- ifest in his countenance. Calling to him the chief overseer   A TALE OF THE FIRST TEMPLE.     73 he demands in a voice of kingly authority: "What is the. cause of this confision? Why are not the Craftsmen, at work?" Bowing his head upon his breast, and obsequiously kneeling, the overseer said: "O, King live forever! Thy servants are idle because they have no work-there are no further designs laid down for them to work out." "No work-no designs! exclaimed the King; "where then is your Master Hiram of Tyre?" "He is not about the Temple, and thy servant has not seen him since yesterday. I fear he is ill at Bethany." At once the King dispatched a message to Hiram's home. In due time he returned with intelligence that the Builder was not there, nor had they. seen him since he left them at an early hour the day before. They supposed he had been detained on the King's business, and 'were now filled with alarm. Instantly the King ordered strict search to be made in and about the Temple, but he could not be found, nor any trace of his whereabouts ascertained. Now thoroughly alive to the state ot affairs, the King or- dered each overseer to personally inspect his band of work- men. This done, it became painfully evident that Hiram of Tyre' had been slain, for several suspicious characters were missing, and could not be found, while from others it appeared that a conspiracy had been entered into to ex- tort the secret word of a Master from him or take his life. The fell spirit of Jahaz had infused itself into a few of the most abandoned of the workmen, and they had way- laid the Master with the design of forcing from him the  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7765-00000040"/> 74        SIGNET OF HRAM; secrets which their bad conduct rendered them unfit to hold. Firm in his integrity, he had resisted their attempt, and in their anger they slew him and fled! We need not enter into further description of; this great, catastrophe-- suffice it to know that our ancient operative Grand Mas-          ' ter was: basely slain, and for a tinme:the work on the Tem- r ple ceasol. The .murderers were finally captured,and con- fessing their crithe, they were executed in the most igno- m ruinous manner possible. Then, with great pomp and au- gust ceremonies, the body of our ancient Grand Master Hiram was disinterred, and borne from the loneJy spot whlere they had hidden it to the city, where it received sepulture at the hands of the highest and noblest of the laid. And then the work was -resumed under the direc- tion of other skillful hands and pushed forward to com- pletion. Reader, our tale is now told. It only ,remains for us to say. that Asher received merited preferment, and leav- ing his cottage home on the slope of Lebanon, enteied in- the household seivice of King Solomon. In d'ue time the solemn marriage rite made Elam and the daughter of Jobal of one flesh, and so, in peace and happiness we leave them to journey together down the declivity of life. -     &#xD;</p>
