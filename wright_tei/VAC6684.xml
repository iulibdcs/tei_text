OMAR said of the KORAN, "Burn the libraries; for their value is in this book." We do by no means apply this fanatical compliment to the following pages; but whoever will read them carefully through will find the best of the sensational libra- ries of the times, and in many sentences some of the best things written or debated among men.  The mountain whence these boulders were de- tached, however, is neither Goethe the writer, Plato the philosopher, or Shakspeare the poet (though some of the "Confessions of a Poet" are herein reported); indeed, they are not boulders, nor yet again are they ashlars. They are only the dew- drops that clung, each a glistening world, on the "Leaves of Grass,"- and I, LELAND SEARCHER, the reporter of this volume, could not help shaking the    <pb n="0" xml:id="VAC6684-00000003"/> PREFACE.   *  watery globes from the field where the weeds were not only overtopping and choking out the grass, but hiding from view these precious gems,- which, falling into the lips of beauty, have dropped as so many pearls into these pages, for the easy gathering of the people. "Grassdale" is also brought under contribution. In fact, this little book, humble as it is, absorbs much of the Speculation, Intuition, Metaphysics, and Romance of the literature of the times, and is designed to represent clearly and in their legiti- mate fascination the love which is of the earth, and that which is of heaven. LELAND SEARCHER.   WILL IT COME? CHAPTER I. OH dear, how hard it is climbing up these steeps! don't you think so, Tishey?" "Yes, somewhat so; but then, it is good exercise, you know; and what a necessity this is to health and beauty, according to the lecture we heard last evening, Elzie!" "O Tishey, how much you were taken with that man! You have scarcely talked any thing since but exercise, physical train- ing, and such nonsense!" "I am sorry I annoy you, pet, but it seems to me you need just this kind of talk from some one, till you practise the thing; for how uncomfortable you always make    <pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6684-00000004"/> 6}T WILL IT COME? yourself when there is a long ramble on foot - like this, for instance." "Make myself uncomfortable, Tishey! I'd like to know how one can help being uncomfortable scrambling about through these scraggy bushes and brambles, and bruising one's limbs on these sharp rocks!" "Yes, darling, it is a difficult climb, and this is the reason you should be well pre- pared with good thews and sinews like mine, which you can only have by training them, according to this most excellent teach- er, whom you accuse me of being in love with." ' Strength, health!' why, do you agree with this man that there is nothing else in the world but 'strength,' 'health,' thews and sinews,' as you call them?-- though I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean by thews and sinews." "Yes, I do think there is something be- sides physical health and strength in life, but these are the primary elements, the great   WILL IT COME?       7 necessities indeed, to the other good things awaiting the brave,--as there are waiting beautiful views at the top of this mountain for us, Elzie." "Oh dear, yes, I've no doubt of it; but it's so dreadful getting to them; I am so tired I never shall have courage to go on." "We shall have to go through a great deal of dreadfulness in this world, Elzie, and I mean to educate you for the journey the best I can. I read Ruskin the other day, and he says, 'No road to any good knowledge is wholly among the lilies and grass: there is rough climbing to be done always.' So let us climb on." i Yes, I'll be with you soon, -but wait a moment, Tishey: I've been readingi Ruskin, too, and I think he says somewhere that 'people are always talking of perseverance  and courage and fortitude; but patience is the finest and worthiest part of fortitude, and the rarest, too.' And again, that 'patience lies at the root of all pleasures, as well as of all powers. "    <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6684-00000005"/> 8      WILL IT COME? "True, I remember it, and further, that 'Hope herself ceases to be happiness when Impatience companions her.' But does this splendid philosopher mean by this, that 'we should sit down and fold our hands, and neg- lect the cultivation of these locomotive pow- ers, and thus neglect to enjoy the beauties and splendors of the beautiful world we illhabit? Does he mean, or does any true reason urge, that Patience, who really smiles at grief, and is unabashed at dangers and difficulties, usually sits and waits? 'I think not. I think she seldom sits, though she may sometimes have to do it for many a d&amp;ay, poor thing, by monuments; or like Chaucer's 'with face pale, upon a hill of sand.' But we are not reduced to that, Elzie.  0? ' patience must climb to-day. So give me your hand, pet, and I will help you up this roughest place. I presume Leal and Lessie are at the top ere this." No, reader, Leal and Lessie were not at the top. For "Leal" is myv own personal   WILL IT COlME?     9 cognomen, and Lessie is -well, no matter now. I will tell you all about her by-and-by. Leal and Lessie, then, were sitting on a jutting rock only just above the fair dispu- tants or conversationalists with whom this chapter opens, and I, that is, Leland Search- er, busied myself, not, as the romantic and fanciful would conjecture, in transferring the beautiful harebells we found growing in the very edges of the gray rocks, to the more fitting place for them in the golden locks of the fairy mortal by my side, nor in whisper- ing in her ear the music of her own beauty or gazing into the liquid depths of her soul- fill blue eye to see if my image were reflect- ed in its heaven. Oh, no: I was writing down in " short-hand" just what you have been reading; and by your permission, gelu- tle reader, we Will--that is, I will (for Lessie is lost in sight-seeing, or dreaming, or something) --continue to report what the aforerfientioned talkers are talking, or may talk-- for Lessie arnd I intend to keep in 1*    <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6684-00000006"/> 10     WILL IT COME? hearing distance, only just in advance of them, and occasionally at some bad or very rough passage to lend them a helping hand, or send down an encouraging word - as now, for instance :- "Mistaken, there, Tishey--not at the top, by a long way: here we are: look up -a little higher, if you please; on a few brave steps, and you will be in our places." And so up they came, slow, measured, careful step, and tug; and puff, puff, puff, and-Patience was doing her perfect work. "O Tishey, how beautiful this is! how, perfect, how charming!"I heard Nellie exclaiming when she had set foot on the spot Lessie and I had just oqcupied; " but where are Leal and Lessie?" "Up here," I replied from a height above her head some hundreds of feet. "Oh dear, oh dear! I never shall get up there, never, never, I am so tired; but this view, these views I should have said, how they pay one for climbing to them: don't they, Tishey?"   WILL IT COME?      " "Arn't you glad now that you were perse- vering and courageous and patient, Elzie?" "Oh dear, yes: how very uncomfortable I always manage to make every one about me when every thing isn't just to please me! I wonder you have so much patience with me, Tishey. But you always know how to man- age me, as well as the Lilliputians did Gul- liver. You don't stick me full of arrows, however, when you would have me quiet, as they did him; but somehow your quiet eyes and sweet voice shame the silliness all out of me. Who knows but they will yet shame me into a real heroine?" "Shame is not the word, my pet. I would much rather inspire than shame you. But we are talking when we should be look- ing. "Yes, Tishey, but somehow, after one such gaze at a beautiful scene like this, I am so full of the beauty and the grandeur, that I lose myself, I lose every thing personal, and seem to float away and become all spirit,--    <pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6684-00000007"/> 12     WILL IT COME? and I need your words to keep me in my body. Tell me, then, while we are resting here, how you can inspire me to be something. Oh, I would so like to be good and beautiful, and - and like yourself, Tishey, noble, high- toned; and-oh dear, I don't know how to express it - won't you express it for me?" "Dear Elzie, I fear you rate me too high, and your own dear and beautiful self too low altogether. I have more clearness of purpose than you, it is true, more quiet and ceaseless energy; for I am older, and have had more experience in the great school of what is called life; but the real noble- ness of being does not always consist of con- sistency, or of purpose and energy, as some philosophers would have us believe. I don't believe that consistency is always a jewel. Doubt, hesitancy, e  ti, bthi   repeat , botc , re- touching and wondering all have their proper and legitimate places, and work sometimes to as noble ends as faith, hope, and the other virtues. They are the moral flints which   WILL IT COME?     13 strike against our otherwise cold and steel- like natures, to flash out of them the scintil- lations of the fire divine. "In your restlessness, Elzie, I see the flint striking to a good purpose; only let us be careful not to waste the fire it kindles. If it burns as a star, attracting the gaze of won- der and of science, and perhaps indicating heaven, instead of lighting swamps as a will- o'-the-wisp, or worse, consuming the altar on which it burns then will it prove an inspiration, and not a shame. We shall find many craggy steeps to climb and rough and thorny passages to thread before we get well through this world, Elzie; and this flint will long be needed, doubtless, to kindle and re- kindle a flame to light you on, till the light of your own soul is clear, continuous, and steady as that of the planet. You are only a meteor now, darling--but such a beautiful meteor that I cannot help admiring you even more than I do some who are more planet- like. Somehow I admire and love your very    <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6684-00000008"/> "     WILL IT CO IME fretfulness, it seems so like a cascade-all the more musical that it is restless--only the water seems happy as it leaps and laughs over its jagged way, and you do not. "And this is the reason, pet, that I am always rebuking your impatience, for I love you too well to see you needlessly unhappy without an effort to turn the current into power for your own, interests,--very like many other Yankees, who can never see a beautiful cascade delighting the eyes anld ears of men without the wish at lelast of turning it to some practicable account." "Then you do really love such a good-for- nothing as poor me? You, who are so clear- seeing, so much like a judgment, or as I imagine the judgment they talk about so much. I know, or rather I believe, you do love me; but it is almost 'too good to be true,' as I have sometimes heard people say of universal salvation. And do you know, Tishey, how I wonder that you do admire me and love me? Our minister says - and how   WILL IT COME?      15 can I help believing such a good and learned man! - that God is angry with me every day; that I am very, very wicked, and deserv- ing of, oh dear, I don't know how much wrath and punishment, and - and- this is why -that is, this is one reason why I wonder that you love me, or how any one can love me. And O Tishey, if I can't be loved, or if I am not worthy to be loved, I don't want to live." "And for this very reason, darling, I have taken you with us up these mountains. I want you to breathe a purer atmosphere; to look on nobler and more extended scenes, and for once know the real luxury of a climb like tlis - of real fatigue and real rest-- that I may in real nature open some of her doors to your beautiful soul, and perchance close some of the artificial ones that have been open long enough. But we must try our feet again, Elzie, and we will talk as we climb, when our breath will allow us to do so."    <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6684-00000009"/> 1%   CHAPTER II. BEFORE we (that is, I, Leland Searcher) proceed with the further conversation just interrupted, let me describe, if I can, gentle reader (I suppose all my readers are gentle), the personnel of the fair beings who arc climbing these heights with us, that is, Lessie and I, and whose feet and tongues I can hear distinctly as I write, and whose beautiful persons I can see occasionally as they come puffing, scrambling, tugging up, now stopping to take breath, now reaching out to try the hand-hold, now almost wildly exclaiming, "Oh dear! "How beautiful!" "How tired I am!"5-  Shall we ever get there?" etc., etc. Letitia Percival was young, - why should I tell her exact age?- she was at the age when women look best, loveliest. She was    <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6684-00000010"/> 18      WITLL IT COME? nlot wanting in maturity of beauty nor in the charm of freshness. She had that unde- finable attractiveness which lies in youth often when every other element of power to please is wanting, -as we love the rose more perhaps in the bud than in the flower, though neither is its form so perfect nor its color so enlivening; and yet she HAD all these other powers. She united in her per- son both the bud and the bloom. She had a figure as near to perfection as one may look for in real life, and features that were noble in the best sense of the term, besides being exquisitely feminine. A high and queenly head, set upon a neck to shadow out whose grace were not easy for compari- son; shoulders shaped so truly that one could almost wonder that lines so perfect did not catch every artist's eye and hold it spell-bound till his chisel or brush had trans- ferred its beauty for his own fame; the cxpanded, but not too high nor too decided brow; the firm, well-set, and delicate nose;   WILL IT COMAE      .19 the rich, ripe, curved lips, making the mouth so exquisitely beautiful, so chaste, and yet so inviting, so full and warm and dewy, and yet so peculiarly modest and shy, that a beholder must wonder whether in touching with his own he would lose his life or gain it; and then she had those large, long eyes which sometimes seemed blue and sometimes of a charcoal blackness, the long, dark, silken lashes deeper in their shade than the fall of night, and lids that seemed too large and heavy for the orbs they canopied, making the seeming change in the color, as the emo- tious caused them to rise or fall. Her com- plexion is difficult of description. It was passionate, and it was not.' It was the lily and the rose so intimately and deliciously bllended throughout, that it were impossible to tell which invited most, the lily calling to prayer and heaven, or the rose, softly, warmly, luxuriously tempting earthward. And then she dressed so well, so simply simply as the most refined taste could    <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6684-00000011"/> 20      WILL IT CO1ME wish, yet with such skill that nothing seemed wanting that money could add; and in that chiefest point in female or-nament -a true adjustment of the hair - she was so finished. Her beauty, however, was most apparent when she was moving; she was so graceful, so elastic and easy, and yet so firm of car- riage, that each new position, or change in her movement, seemed always to display her person to the best advantage. In both her physique and expression, she seemed a real embodiment of the wise Minerva and the chaste and agile Diana. Such is Letitia Percival. Shall I attempt to paint her further? Imagine, then, if you can, the scene before me at this moment. The sun is setting in golden glory, and thatt love- liest of colors which looks a blended tint of orange, green, and pink, is suffusing far up the western heaven; the lake at the base of the mountain is robed in beauty such as sel- dom meets the eye; and a rosy light, warm yet mellow, and delicately indistinct, as   WILL IT CO ME?      21 though there were some subtile and impal- pable medium between it and the eye; the warmth and life of sunshine with the mellow tone and dreamy repose of moonlight, wrap the motutains, smoothing their rude sub- limity to touching gracefulness, like the flattered landscape of a fine painting. The mind yields to the influence of the hour, and is lapped in the listless consciousness of high and dreamy reverie. Its thoughts are of love, high purpose, great ends; soulful am- bition, solomn-thoughted and sublime life- life in its overflow. And such even as this (the soul of Nature, shall I call it?) to my mind is Letitia Percival, natural, healthy, beautiful, all aglow and full of passion, and yet spiritual,- Psyche bending o'er the couch of Love, Elzie Estelle Aidens was more of a Diana ere she was enamoured of Endvmion. Hers was a beauty more difficult of description. Her features were regular and exquisitely feminine; her brow was serene and purely    <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6684-00000012"/> 22     IWILL IT COME? intellectual, shaded by soft fine tresses c" that shade which has a sunniness of color and seems itself expressive of a mind un- stained and virginal; her eyes were of a color that seemed a mixture of the deepest blue with the darkest gray, and their look was fascination; long they were and large, the violet-veined lids being of that shape which gives both softness and power to ex- pression; her eyebrows were curved as by an artist's pencil, and much darker than her hair; her mouth was rose-tinted, and fash- ioned like a cherub's, and had that innocence and freshness of character and color which, alas! are seldom seen much after childhood; when she smiled, the upper lip curled up- ward from the pearly teeth, and rested there thus a brief delightful moment- a peculiarity which they who have seen it in beauty's lip well know to be enchanting; her complex- ion was fair in the extreme, almost transpa- rent, but of little color save a slight tinge of rose on the cheeks, and a darker tinge under-   WILL IT COME?      23 neath the eyes, which added much to their effect. Her whole face seemed made on , purpose for the expression of soul - that is, for the shrine of that love and truth and tenderness which are alone of woman's nature -of woman when she is best and purest. Like Letitia's, her form was nearly perfect; but Letitia's step was firmer, her carriage more stately, and her person was full and rounded almost to voluptuousness; while Elzie's extreme but symmetrical slenderness looked like fragility, and every motion she made seemed to woo support. And this is the secret of the spell she has woven over the heart of her more experienced and mun- dane companion. She always looks, as she gazes on her, as though she were planning how to shelter so timid and defenceless a creature, and guard her with her own strong heart and hand from the rains, the frosts, and the storms of a wintry and ungenial world. Shall I attempt the painting of Lessie, my sister Lessie? Oh, she is a creature made up    <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6684-00000013"/> 24      WILL IT COllE? of purity and winning gentleness. Lctitifl and Elzic are beings to admire,to love, to live for; Lessie, to bless, to idolize, to die- for! ier flesh is of the snow-drift, her blood is of the dew. Her beauty is such as we give the angels, -so ethereal, so con- fiding, that one can only think of drawing her to his bosom and whispering coura'ge as tenderly to her ear as she looks and speaks to every living thing, -for there is nothing, llow poor soever, or how vile, to whichi she can be ungentle. And for herself, -unkind- ness would wear away her seraph-spirit, - a harsh reproach would kill her.  Shall I borrow help from Nature, in a firther description of her? We left our hotel at the foot of the mountain at the first peep of daybreak, to profit by the coolness of the morning. The stars had lost their glimmer, and, dim before the advancing dawn, were lessening in the west and in the pale blue middle sky; a few thin clouds, of fleecy lightness, and of the most beautiful and   WILL IT COlIE?      25 delicate rose color, stood motionless in the east as heralding the sun; the dew shone heavy on bush and herbage; the atmosphere had a reviving fragrance, a transparency which betokened pureness, and a freshness and purity which told of youth. All was clear, serene, cool, and, vigorous, - the waking of a new day. The elastic mind quickened to the early breath of Nature, and, stainless as the dew, turned to the blue heaven in worship. Its thoughts were of religion,-of the spiritual beauty, the all- pervading Intelligence, the Divinity shaping all ends and gov'erning in all events. And such, oh reader, is my sister Lessie,- the morning twilight,-beautiful, spiritual, chastely delicate, and lovely from. very purity. She invites, attracts us, not so much to herself as to prayer, praise, wor-  ship, heaven.    <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6684-00000014"/> I   CHAPTER III. "RAND so I come back to your question, which I put aside a little while ago, Elzie. You are taught, then, that you are 'very, very wicked;, and deserve God's angry judgments? And do you really be- lieve this, - that 'your heart is all evil, and only evil continually'?" "Yes, Tishey: don't the Bible say so, and don't you believe it?" "I am not discussing the Bible, nor my own belief, pet: I am for the momentonly catechising you, and I press the questien: do you really believe, as you have been taught, that you are entirely bad, incapable of think- ing a good thought or doing a good deed - wholly, utterly depraved?" "Yes, Tishey: how' can I believe other- wise when the Bible says so, the minis-    <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6684-00000015"/> 28      WILL IT COME?  ters say so - why, don't everybody believe it?" "No matter what everybody believes: let us confine ourselves to ourselves, for the time, Elzie, and so-oh, see here! this poor little fledgeling birdie, - what a beauty!-  and almost dead. How came it up here so high, and so lonely and pitiable? What shall we do with it, Elzie? Poor thing! it is just alive-see its little lungs flutter. I wonder if it has a heart? Yes, you canhear it throb ; just put your ear to its little chest. What shall we do with it? Oh, I see there is only one thing to be done. Please hand me that stone just there, Elzie."

If not, you horrify me.' "Well, then, I'll hold its head, and you deal the blow."   WTILL IT COMEKE     29 "I?? I kill that little innocent? You certainly cannot be in earnest, Tishev." "Why not? Then you like to see it slf- fer?" "Why, Tishey Percival! I like to see this poor wee tling suffer? What do you take me for?" 'A very, very wicked girl,' Elzie, as you have just acknowledged yourself to be." "O Tishey, I didn't mean wicked like that." "Well, then, will you deal the blow upon his cunning little head, and end its misery at once?"  "What makes you ask me, Tishey? You now I wouldn't kill this little thing; you  now I couldn't do it."  "That's not true, Elzie. You know you  would delight to kill it." "Letitia, in heaven's name are you out of our senses?"

"Cannot speak the truth 1 Do you mean to frighten me?" "No: but how can truth come from such a totally depraved heart? It is 'wholly de- ceitful,' you know. But what shall we do with birdie? If we let it remain here it will perish ere to-morrow morning. If we take it with us, we may save it a good deal of suffering, and perhaps its life, Elzie." "By all means, let us take it. I would rather turn back and not enjoy the moun- tains, than to let it perish here, all alone, precious little thing!" "Well, then, I see no other way but to take it along with us, though our mercy will prove somewhat costly to our convenience, and doubtless to our patience also. But are you sure, Elzie, that you are ready to bear your part of the burden -your share of the inconvenience?" Sure? Yes: I will bear the whole of it."

But suppose the little unfortunate had ever done you an injury, - suppose it had stolen some crumbs from the bread you were eating, and suppose the whole of that piece of bread was necessary to keep you from starving, and that this poor little thing even knew your life was the price of its theft, -would your tenderness give place to the stone and the execution?" "No, Tishey, I don't think it would. It is so helpless and so beautiful; and, besides, it is a bird." "And so are you a birdie, darling, how many millions of times more beautiful than this little thing, and just about as innocent and harmless, you wicked mortal, -though I will not vouch for the harmless when those eyes of violet are once fully fixed in certain directions. And how well I know those directions, Elzie, and how truly I sympa- thize with you, I do not need to say, in your father's stern decree, that your eyes 5         .    <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6684-00000017"/> 32     WILL IT COMiE? shall turn that way no more. Nay, do not turn them from gme, darling: I did not mean to make them thus dewy by this allusion. But you know I see clearly how it is with you. First, heart-sickness, then soul-sick- ness, and I can already see the shadow of a certain wing, which I must melt away inl the higher light, if possible. You are sick, you beautiful creature, sick through and through, -sick of life ere it is tasted, and at the foot of the cross, or at the door of the sepulchre, looking, or trying to look, beyond the veil, into the mysteries no mor- tal eye hath yet fathomed, and longing yet dreading to die. I am not surprised that you weep, -I anticipated it, - and am glad the founts are opened. Shall I smite the rock again?--for you know your heart is not only very wicked, but very hard, -hard as a rock ." "Yes, smite on, my angel, for such you are to me,-such are you commissioned of heaven, I am sure; and had it not been   WILL IT COME?  * 35 for your wings of good sense and kindness, the shadow you speak of had long ere this been my shroud, I fear, Tishey." "Well, then, how many ladies' difficulties arise from their falling in love with the wrong person; but they ought not to let themselves fall in love till they know he is the right one." "That's not my case, Tishey. Olh, no, no, no! Wrong person!  iHe, -  Frank King- man,-the wrong person? O Tishey, you talk of his being the wrong person,-you, who have seen him, talked with him! Where in the whole earth is the right person, then? Were you blind when you looked upon that manly form, into those soulful eyes, upon the peculiar beauty of that clustering hair falling so like shadowy wings over that high, broad, noble brow, upon that majestic yet youthful and buoyant step? Were you deaf when you drank in the music of that deep yet mellow and rounded voice?

If you can talk so of him, what  may not others say? -what will his enemies - enemies? Who can be an enemy to him? Oh, I will live, -I must live, - for the first time in my life I feel it impossible to die. God will let me live, to -to --" "To defend him from me, - from the at- tacks of my saucy, good-for-nothing tongue, the only enemy, doubtless, he has in the world. But not too fast, my pet. Did I say he was a bad person, or unworthy in any way?  Nay, I think I did not mention his name, even. I simply laid down a general proposition, at which you took fright, and away went your beautiful spirit on Cupid's guardian wings, to brood over and shield the shrine where your heart took its first peep   WILL IT COME      35 into heaven, but which now threatens to be its sepulchre,--but which must not be its sepulchre, - for you are too young, and too beautiful, and too desirable to many, many friends, to step behind the veil just yet. And, as you have just exclaimed, you must live for this 'wrong person:' this frank king among men, as your poor foolish little heart deems him, will need your eloquent tongue in his defence much more than you have just now guessed." "Need me in his defence, Tishey? What do you mean? Has he any enemies, then? Oh,he is too good, too noble, too pure, to-" "Enemies! -who that breathes mortal breath but has enemies? Too good! too noble!-indeed. Why, think one moment, Elzie, your own dear, precious father, good and generous, though stern and bigoted as he is, is his enemy! and if your father, he who knows him so well, or who ought to know him, after an acquaintance of years, will set himself in opposition to the highest and    <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6684-00000019"/> 36     WILL IT COME? dearest ambition of his life, the attainment of your hand, my precious, what may he not ex- pect from ordinary mortals? .Besides, these external foes are as nothing to true manhood or womanhood, in comparison to the legions of internal ones we all have to meet sooner or later. Do you suppose there is only one man sent out of heaven from the bosom of the Father to be led into the wilderness, or upon the mountain, by the hydra-headed solicitations of ambition, pride, avarice, ap- petites, etc.? In your idolatry, you think this man a god, and you reckon your own dear self as nothing : do you not? Yes; and you would marry him if you could, that is, if your father would give his consent:- would you not? Yes; and so thought a certain young lady many centuries ago, of a young man of Nazareth, though we have no testi- mony that she wished to marry her Lord! She certainly loved him very much, and we know he was worthy of all the love she or any one could bestow upon him. But do   WILL IT COME?      37 you, does anybody, suppose that he was 'the right one' Tor Mary to fall in love with? He doubtless had the manly form, the bold, broad brow, the flowing locks, the soulful eyes, the majestic step, the musical voice, the elevated sentiments, etc., which you so eloquently and so truly attribute to 'the god of your idolatry,'-but was he, my pre- cious pet, the proper person to lead Mary to the altar, and take her for better or for worse, to be his lawfully wedded wife?" "Oh, no: of course nobody would ever allow that for a moment, Tishey. Why, how singular that you should ever think of such a thing! I'm sure no other mortal ever did." "Simply because he was so far her supe- rior, I suppose? Yes; for he doubtless loved her as well, at least, as she did him. Now apply the lesson to your own case, Elzie." "Oh, but theirs was a different kind of love altogether, and they were very different beings."    <pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6684-00000020"/> 38     !WILL IT COME? "Different beings and higher, doubtless; but why a different kind of love? Is not all pure love the same in all beings, in all time, in every part of the earth? You may reply that some is mixed with the elements of the lower nature, as dross is with the gold, or charcoal with the diamond; that theirs was doubtless the refined, the spiritual only; while you may admit - and your wish to marry is admitting--that yours is of the earth, partly. And this is the very point I wish to come to. "But let us settle the already started pro- position first, that he, that is, the said Frank Kingman, is the wrong man for Elzie Estelle Aidens. For Mary to marry Jesus, would be wrong, you admit, on the ground of his infinite superiority: why not admit the same thing in your own case? Frank King- man is noble, generous, pure, intellectual, cultivated, splendid, - in a word, a god, in your estimation, - and Elzie Estelle Aidens is a little good-for-nothing - a very, very   WILL IT COME?     39 wicked young lady, desperately wicked, and deceitful above all things, fit only for burn- ing in the unquenchable fire. Now how much can you really love this paragon of excellence, this nobleman among men, to wish him so deplorable a fate as taking such a creature into partnership for life? Do you not see the wisdom of your father in refusing to burden such. a man with such a load of sin and vanity? "But really now, in sober earnest, what is it you love in this man, this King-man, that because you cannot have it to your own use and behoof so long as you both do live, you are longing to die? Is it his hair, his eyes, his voice? Is it the temple of the living soul, or the soul itself? Both, you will doubtless answer. So Mary loved both the temple and its priest; and, of course, it is difficult to separate them in our regards in any case. But Mary loved, worshipped, without ap- propriating the temple to herself alone : can't you tlo the same? Which do you prize the    <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6684-00000021"/> 40      WILL IT COME? most, Elzie, the ship he sails in, or its master?  The ship may sail foreign and even unknown seas; but if the master is true to you, and makes due returns of interest, profits, etc., can you not forego the pleasure of seeing, walking the decks, and perhaps petting the noble vessel which bears such rich freight and is commanded by so glorious a captain? "I know the answer that is almost choking you, Elzie, and I know also that your dear heart is almost bursting with its fulness, and so I will not probe it further at present. You are a poor little wounded, suffering birdie, and I must carry you in nmy bosom, or you will perish. "There, now, do you feel my strong arm around you? That's right: plant your foot firmly, - a little further and we shall be through this rough passage, and the summit will be gained." "But oh dear, I am so frightened-who is this we are meeting?" Frank!"Elzie!"

He was a man of ster- ling intellect and varied accomplishments; in person elegant, in morals irreproachable, and with one of the best hearts in the world. Though but three years older than myself, he had the manners of a man of forty; never laughed, seldom smiled, talked but little. Wherever met, you would have known him for a gentleman; but then, ten to one you would have set him down for a cold, un- bending, arbitrary character, and there you would have done him wrong; for under this crust of formality and reserve he had warm passions, but he never indulged them. It was stern, uncompromising principle which was the mentor of his actions, and which 4-    <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6684-00000023"/> "   W  ILL IT COME? shaped them to the square and the compass. The ashlar was always finished. His person was elegant, tall, gracefil, yet vigorous and remarkably distinguished. His head high, broad at the crown, and capacious from temple to temple; forehead bold and massive, and wide between the brows; com- plexion fair and pale; hair light of color, fine with a slight tendency to curl, and pro- fuse in quantity. His eyes deep blue, open, steady, and sad; and he had a peculiar but most impressive manner of raising them slowly, and fixing them full upon you with an earnestness that had nothing of excitement in it, but was calm, collected, melancholy, and at times even mournful. A nose beauti- fully straight, long, and set upon the face like the celebrated painting of Mary of Scots; but with the nostrils more curved and dilated. Small ears; a manly, firm chin, but somewhat broad, and which the close-cut beard became extremely;. and lastly, a mouth whose expression seldom   TWILL IT COIE?     45 or never varied, and was a very singular mixture of sweetness and severity-to most persons repulsive, perhaps, but to others, impressing them at first sight with an idea of the owner's sternness, but growing on ac- qaintance almost into fascination. The lips full, ripe, and very beautifully colored, were compressed; the upper scalloped in a manner rarely seen in masculine mouths, but then pressed back and upwards as it were, and there slightly flattened; having a general character of unhappiness or disappointment or melancholy or misanthropy, you doubt- ed which to call it, according to the mood that you or he was in. But on the whole it was a fine mouth, full of meaning : a feature to study, and the most important one in the whole physiognomy. As I once said, play- fully, to Frank, it looked as if Nature, when she had finished his lips, had liked their expression so well, that she pressed her fingers on them and made it permanent. When I first saw Frank Kingman, I was    <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6684-00000024"/> ".WILL IT COME? drawn to him by that sympathy one unac- countably feels for certain individuals; generally with those whom a subsequent acquaintance makes us love; an impression that was confirmed when I heard his voice, which, I had forgotten to say, was more in accordance with the appearance of the man than that of any individual I ever encountered, being deep, sonorous, and masculine, inclining perhaps to the solemn. It was particularly liked by women. How far my mood of depression may have influenced him, perhaps both of us, I am not prepared to say; but a very few weeks suf- ficed to ripen our acquaintance into real friendship. In my feelings towards Frank there was mingled a tenderness such as pro- perly belongs to the affection we bear the other sex, and which Kingman never felt, perhaps was incapable of feeling, for me. It was a pleasure for me simply to be near him, or in the same room with him, to look upon his eyes when they were turned from me, or   WILL IT COME?     47 on his small white fingers, - the only part of him that was effeminate, - especially as they played or toyed with the beautiful locks that fell in clusters over his brow. And sometimes when we were seated in my window long after midnight, while the moon was going down, conversing on my favorite themes the stars, the mysteries of life, the hidden object of creation, and that wondrous nature of infinity and eternity which, while it stands undoubted, mocks the limit of mortal intellect, -when a pause in the conversation would occur, I longed to put my arm about the small waist of Frank, lean upon his manly breast, and - but I should not confess this weakness. Certainly, melancholy and the hour had much to do with this effeminate emotion, and my nerves were yet unstrung by the sorrows and - but I was not to confess. A great cause of my fondness for this noble man was probably - I thought so even then - the untiring patience -'uith which he invariably listened to my novel    <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6684-00000025"/> 48      WILL IT COME? doctrines, and bore my egotistical enthusi- asm. Carried away by the excitement of subjects which had for me a magic I could not resist, I would discourse for hours with the fervor, the rapidity, and perhaps the rhapsodism, of an improvisatore, while Frank would never interpose a word, nor betray the least sign of impatience, much as I know I must at times have wearied him. Oh that I could have an audience of thousands made up of such beings, to whom I might unbosom the thoughts that make my unsupported" spirit heave with their conception, and - but I dream. Perhaps not, however; for who knows but an audience is awaiting, an as- sembly of tens and hundreds of thousands into whose eyes from the printed page I may yet pour the new afflatus that is for ever surging and'surging within me, and strug- gling for birth, as delightedly as I used the ears of my friend Kingman! Do I talk wild? And yet while I am telling the story of some dozen lives, or parts of these lives,   TWILL IT COME?     49 why may I not speak to you personally, oh gentle reader? I will not detain you long at a time; but I must speak to you, for I fear you are walking in a dream. Indeed, I see you wandering among shadows, bereft bewildered, and sorrowing, and I must wake you to the music of your own being. Every thing else is awake. The stars sing, the. trees clap hands, the rocks preach, the ocean calls to prayer; but your oracle has been and is dilatory and dumb. You have not known, you do not know, what you are. What you have done returns in mockeries; but the mockeries are not you. Underneath and within them I see you slumbering, and place my finger on your eyes, and lo! what scenes, what glories and  grandeurs about you! The glories of the east and west are tame compared to them. Immense mea- dows, interminable rivers, eternal hills-- did you think you were less immense, in- terminable, eternal?

Six hundred millions of lung- cells, and seven millions of skin-tubes, are in love with it, mad for it, drink it in. Lo! the fragrance with which this elixir of life is loaded, and undulating towards you. It is distilled on purpose for your nostrils, to intoxicate your senses -it is the breath of the Almighty, it is your breath, your inspi- ration. Lo! the beating of your heart-- a hundred thousand times a day: the passing of blood through its chambers, two ounces at every beat, a hundred and forty ounces every minute, two hogshead every hour- seven tons every day ! Lo! the millions of chambers through which this red river of life runs, feeding the millions of nerves which   WILL IT COME ?   51   gift these two hundred and forty bones and four hundred and seventy muscles with the poetry of motion I Lo I the millions of cells in the brain in which it deposits its oxygen and carbon, and the tubes through which it pours its phosphorus, -the spontaneous combustion of these elements rushing through the five ventricles, and along the telegraph nerves, in  thoughts that breathe and words that burn!"

You shall be the seer, the sage, the poet, the prophet, and shall filter all things from your own soul. Sure as the most certain, upright as any, easy to be entreated- strong, affectionate, hauglhty, electrical, I see you stand in the mysteries, clear and sweet in soul, yearning to know the perfect fitness and equanimity of things, glorious in every organ and attri- bute, heartyl nd cle:an. Not an inch, nor a particle of an inch of you is vile. Depravity to him who thinks it. Let the curses return to roost whence they came. Trippers and askers and haters to the winds.  Apart from pulling and hauling, stand complacent, idle, amused, compassionate, unitary -both in and out of the game, watching and won- dering. Witness and wait, curious what will come next. Believe, not in music nor rhyme nor custom nor lecture nor books, not even the   WILL IT CO 3IE?     53 best, but in the lull. "The wind bloweth where it listeth;" but it bears on its wings only the ghosts of the flowers. Loose the valves of your heart, the stop from the chambers of your brain, and lo! how your soul plunges through and through you, till it reaches the tip of your hair, and the tip of your feet, and swiftly spreads around you the peace and joy and knowl- edge that pass all the art and argument of earth; and you know that the hand of the Infinite is the promise of your own, - that his spirit is your spirit, his bosom your pillow, and the beating of his infinite heart your music. And all things fall into their infinite and beautiful relations. All men and women, everywhere from the beginning to the end, are your brothers and sisters and lovers; the whole broad earth your prolific and beautiful mother. The light is lighter and full of a new meaning; the hieroglyph- ics of the stars are interpreted; the air is suffused with a spiritual baptism and aglow    <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6684-00000028"/> 54     WILL IT COME P with supernal beauty. The kelson of crea- tion is felt and understood. You are not contained between your hat and boots. You see through the broadcloth and the gingham. You are not a clod, nor an adjunct of a clod. You are the mate and companion of the beating hearts and uttering tongues, -tenacious, tireless, acquisitive,-- not guilty nor stale nor discarded, and can never be shaken away. Immortal, fathom- less, limitless,- you do not know how immortal, invisible, and yet visible, I wish I could translate the hints about you. I see more in your eyes than all the print I have read in all my life. I hear more in your voice than in all the music of the spheres. You have done snivelling that years are vacuums, and the earth but wallow and filth; that life is a suck and a sell, and nothing remains at the end but threadbare crape and tears. Whimpering and truck- ling and conformRity go to the fourth re- moved. You write "whim" over the lintels   WILL IT COME?     55 of your door, and do not diffuse nor venerate nor whine a prayer to heaven. You have pried through the strata, analyzed to a hair, counselled, calculated close, and know that this orbit of yours cannot be swept by a carpenter's compass. Knowing you are solid and sound, august, deathless, you do not trouble your soul to vindicate itself, or care whether you are understood. You see that the elementary laws never apologize. You behave no prouder than Nature. Ex- isting as you are, content though the whole world be aware or no, being aware yourself, content if coming to your own, and if not coming to your own, cheerfully waiting, your foothold is tenoned and mortised in granite; and knowing the amplitude of time, and the chemistry of things, you laugh at the prate of dissolution as the babble of a child. To you the smallest sprout shows there really is no death, - only change. The wood burns, and lo! the ashes fructify the earth, and the smoke joins the clouds. All    <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6684-00000029"/> 56      WILL IT COME? goes onward and outward; nothing collapses, and passing away means only passing on, and is different and luckier than any one sup- poses. To you all the conVerging objects of the universe perpetually flow, are all written to you as so many letters full of rare reve- lations and fresh inspiration. Divining what the writing means, the pleasures of heaven you graft and increase upon yourself, and the pains of hell you translate into a new tongue. You see there has been too much ducking' and deprecating, too much blurt about two opposite equatls coming' up out of dimness for ever and ever.

No sentimen- talist, no partizan, no devotee, no stander above men and women, or apart from them, you beat the gong of revolt, speak the pass- word primeval, give the sign of the star and the cross. You make short account of neuters and genders; of nomens and agnomens; of arcs. and curves; of caliper, scalpel, chart, con- pass.  Listening to the divine afflatus, surging and surging for ever and ever, you learn the current and the index; you hear the long dumb voices -voices of the inter- minable generations-voices of the cycles of preparation and accretion, and of the threads that connect the stars - earth-beat, sea-beat, heart-beat, which make the tune to which the sun rolls and the globules of blood and the sap of trees." You do not see a mean man or anl infidel  hi existence; you wonder they ever existed. Divine, inside and out, you touch every thing to holiness. Seeing, hearing, feeling, are 3*    <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6684-00000030"/> 58      WILL IT COME? miracles: each shred of the two thousand parts of you is a miracle. The exhaling vapor of your rich blood is aromal finer than prayer; the occult convolutions of your brain are more than churches, bibles, creeds. Each moment, and whatever happens, fills you with new wonder. To behold the day break is miracle enough.  The sunflower at your window  satisfies you more than metaphysics; the lily of the valley preaches more than the pulpit. You have instant conductors all over you, which seize every object, and hold it quiv- ering to the play of thought. You see this puzzle of puzzles, called Being, in the focal light, and do not need the obstetric forceps to deliver the truth waiting in all things. The cast wind and the damp of night convince you more than logic or sermons. To you the roadside daisy is as hieroglyphic as the stars, and each flower is the h'andker- chief of God: a scented gift and renlem- brancer bearing the owner's name in its   WILL IT COME      59 dewy folds, and designedly dropped, that wayfaring men might see and ask, whose? The ant, the grain of sand, the dell of dew, the tree-toad, the mouse, are miracles enough to stagger millions of infidels. Placid and self-contained, you do not sweat and complain about your condition; you do not lie awake nights and weep for your sins; you do not sicken others dis- cussing your duty to God; you are not demented with the mania of owning things. You have heard the talkers talk-what they said of the universe-a thousand contend- ers, several thousand years, and know it was well as far as it went. But magnifying and applying, you outhid them all.

Not object- ing to special revelations, you see that a plume of smoke, or a hair on the back of your hand, as curious and infinite as any revelation. The red-coated fire-extinguish- ers and hook-and-ladder companies to you are no less than the gods of the antique wars. The winged meteor of swamps, the fire-fly, gazed at by lusty angels, 1whizzing scythes at harvest, suggest the frankincense and myrrh, the wise men and the star. Out of the fallen old tree, lo! what flowers for ever and ever! "Ring out the old, Ring in the new!" Out of the rags of yesterday's failure, see what paper for to-morrow's history! Filth   WILL IT COME?      61 and dirt are more admirable than was dreamed. Soap and water are next to salvation. Here and now are supernatural enough.

What Frank King-man's religious or doc- trinal opinions were I know not: he never spoke of them to me; but he listened atten- tively to mine, and I loved him that he listened. He was indeed a strange being in many respects: candid when questioned, but, unless appealed to, you might be with him for months together and never know his sentiments on any subject.   WILL IT CO IE?      6 But I have appealed to him on one subject, and that which will interest the reader, doubtless, as intensely as it has me. And as he tells the story of his heart, I report it word for word. Here it is;    <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6684-00000034"/> r)   CHAPTER V. "O-PPOSITE my mother's dwelling was the residence of a poor widow. She had come to live in this humble but neat little cottage while I was away completing my education, and it was nearly a year after my return home before I discovered her only worldly possession. It consisted in an only daughter, whose name I will not give you now, nor do I care to describe her person, only to say, she was beautiful, very, very beautiful. I sought on many occasions for an acquaintance, or an introduction in the ordinary way; but failing in every attempt, I determined upon making myself acquainted in some way, no matter what, for know her I must; and so I commenced a series of watchings from my study window, which was exactly opposite the little chamber    <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6684-00000035"/> 68      WILL IT COlME? where she sat and sewed. And thus for months, almost daily, all unseen, I drank in the beauty which was as fire to my quick imagination, and w7hich was so to affect my whole life, -till at last I grew tired of this tamne idolatry, and determined to risk an experiment. The day was unusually fine, and she sat at her window, looking more )beautiful, and I thought more happy, than I h:ad ever seen her before. She was not sewing on this occasion, but seemed petting something-I could not see what-she held in her lap, and which she evidently loved very fondly, so that I marked the tenderness of her nature as well as her beauty, and thought, oh, what love! what depths of affection to be awakened in that as yet all- untouched and undiscovered fountain! And very carefully and slowly opening my blinds, behind which I had worshipped, all unseen and unknown, I madel the space clear between us, and endeavored to look, but most respect- fully, and doubtless very timidly, what was   tWILL IT COME?     69 speaking at my heart. She lifted her dark, lustrous eyes, oh, so full of tenderness, and just for one delightful moment rested them on mine, then dropped them, blushed, and retired from the window. When she next appeared, her hair seem- ed parted on her brow with even more care than usual, and she took her seat with evident consciousness of being overlooked. Indeed, I thought I could detect her ex- ploring a little from the corner of those dark-fringed lids. After a little while I made a second sally. Again she raised those lustrous orbs, but meeting in my eyes what she might have expected, reddened still more deeply than before, and in a seeming pet, which marked the pleasurable suggestions of her own mind, rather than offence at my behavior, drew one of the shutters between her and the window. I knew from experience that one sees' in safety and with satisfaction through a crevice; so I kept my position,               ,67    <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6684-00000036"/> 70.

"Not too fast, my dear Leland," said Frank; "I will call her Letitia for the pre- sent, because I wish to use some name, and besides I wished to startle your curiosity a little and set you wondering, - which is one part, and I sometimes think the best part, of the romance of this wonderful life of ours; but please don't interrupt me again. s I was saying, then, she grew shy, and showed herself at times embarrassed, espe- cialy when she was looking particularly well; and te the  weather grew unusually unsettled, for the large black eyes were fiequently upturned-to mark the aspect of the heavens, of course. And these looks to heaven, and from heaven for me! I knew   WILL IT CO0M1E?     71 not whether she who directed them could be aware of their peculiar beauty. Their Madonna cast-for such it was, although the inspiration was not holy-made the beating of my heart grow quicker; and when in their descent the lovely orbs would glance upon her neighbor's blinds,--they could not help it, sure, in passing,--and rest there an uncounted instant, an ecstasy quivered through my frame till its thrill was heaven. There, now, my Leland what are you about with that pencil of yours? Trotting my words out on paper, in short-hand, as I live! What is this for, my dear sir?" "Oh, don't you understand, Sir John Franklin, that some day I, Leland Searcher, am to write a novel, and this veritable Sir John is to be the hero?" "Not a bit of it! I exposed?

Well, lhen, I was pure-aye! let those doubt it who will; I was pure and chivalrous, in my sentiments not only, but in my life. I had till now lived in solitude most of my years, in a world of my own peopling. I had not even friend or acquaintance to spread the infec- tion of sensual thought or gross converse on the pure atmosphere of my spirit. Mine were the creations of fancy, not the re,   WILL IT COME      73 things of flesh and blood; I had pored over the pages of ideal virtue, and lived with heroes whose fabulous lives but few of my age had read since the days of Cervantes; and I was - I was--though I hesitate to say it even to your ear, my friend --pure, noble, and high-spirited as they. A thought of gross desire, of any earthly indulgence, purchased at the expense of moral right and honor, I had not nourished, nor blushed over its unhallowed fire a single moment. No! God- that being whose unimaginable power and mysterious existence I never questioned-be my judge, if I ever mingled aught of the dross of sordid desire in the romantic and refined affection with which I loved this strange young loving beauty of life's young morning. No! my heart yearned in the fulness of its young and yet untried affections, to pour itself upon some sympathetic bosom. That 'besoin d'aimner'-that 'strong necessity of loving' which is the parent of all social 4 F3 Ij!      <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6684-00000038"/> 74      WILL IT COLME? feeling, the chain whose varied links bind man and man together in different states and stages of this strangoe existence, that un- shared solitude of the hermit heart which presses with its dull monotony and drowsy inaction on the very springs of life, choking up their wholesome currents, and forcing us, from very weariness and sickness of our- selves, to seek some one on whom to rest the burden of accumulated thought; and, reposing while this one. bears the pressure, see in the confided task but the transferring of the labor to a second self, the shifting of the burden as it were to the other shoulder, -it was this, the yearning of the spirit for a soul congenial, that impelled me onward. I pined in the desolateness of my unwedded heart for something more than I had yet witnessed in marriage, or in the courtship of lovers. I was lonely, visionary, ro- mantic. I looked to my neighbor's win- dow, and I saw  her like myself, lonely, and with features that seemed the index of   WILL IT COME?    75 a soul that should be one with my own. Yes, I said to myself, as I ran over the belautiful lineaments of my fair, opposite, those eyes of fire, with depth like night, and yet "which tell us what the sun is made of;" that proud, broad, marble brow, the lhughty setting of that neck, the full, small, ripe lip, the passion and softness of that skin, -all speak a spirit that is mine I Strong, impetuous, imperious, untamable by aught save affection, and to that tender, submissive, impassionedly devoted, and boundless in its confidence. Oh, what delight it were to teach her young mind all that I feel, and which she cannot have dreamed! to lay open to her the close recesses of a bosom whose deeps no mor- tal yet might fathom, and which none but love's sweet fondness should gain the right to look into! What joy to murmur in her ear the aspiring thoughts whose deeps and heights are spiritual intoxication, and which make the splendor and the greatness of man!    <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6684-00000039"/> 76      WILL IT COME'? to give those very thoulghts the words in which the eloquence of passion could alone invest them! to watch her fond eys res t- ing upon mine, and her attentive spirit hanging on my lips as on the breathing of an oracle I And then, oh then, to teach her own weak wings to soar with mine, to take her with me on pinions whose daring flight knew no check; on from star to star, system to system; to mea- sure with flattered eye the unfolding powers myself had given move to, and encourage its exertions Do you wonder, my dear Leland, that my heart leapt at the thought, and my whole being grew wild almost to insanity? But still more,- and here the wildness softened away into dreamy repose that was heaven,--I thought of the other side of the picture, in my fonder hours, when dizzied of elevation, tired of intel- lectual and spiritual labor,. or melancholy from abstraction, and fevered with excite- ment, or when checked by those intru-   WIILL IT COME?      " sive thoughts, that will steal upon us, of the vanity of all human ambition, mocking like demons at our task, to fling aside the unending page, furl up the aspiring pinions, lay down the intellectual sceptre, and rest my tired head in the lap of affection, - do you wonder, my friend, that my tears flow- ed at the picture? But I was not long content in making pictures and dreaming dreams.  I must see, I said, inwardly, I must speak with this beautiful being. Will she permit it? She certainly must expect it; she knows, she must know, I cannot be content in eternally gazing. It was three, four, going on to five months since I had commenced my courtship with my eyes. I was nearly eaten'up with im- patience. There she is, going down the street, and all alone! Coward that I am, why do I not join her? 'Tis but an effort, a word, a step. Ah! it is too late now. Well, to-    <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6684-00000040"/> 78      WILL IT COME  morrow. And the morrow saw her go out again; but a little child-the pet, doubtless, already referred to - went with the beauty. No matter, I had made up my mind. I followed her; I neared her; my heart beat as though it would stifle me; I heard my breath quick breathing near her neck; I felt it burnincg my throat, and wondered if she felt it too. She bent down and spoke to the child. Angels in heaven! I was always fastidious with the voice, and over-susceptible to a fine one, but hers went through and through me: so soft, so mellow, and so deep,-deep and rounded as I never yet had heard it in woman, yet feminine withal, and delicate as the whisper of a dream. I cannot 'dare it! I felt, rather than thought. I must not address her so ab- ruptly. The street was narrow; I brushed by her, as if by accident, between her and the wall. I meant to touch her somewhat roughly, yet I scarcely moved her shawl.   WILL IT COME?*     79 "Have I hurt you?"I whispered; "in- deed I did not mean to." What an effect has love upon the speech! Even in that moment of excitement, the tones of my own voice, low and tremulous, yet silvery distinct, sounded delicious even ' in my own ears. The dear girl knew I was beside her; she knew that I had followed her; she expected it, perhaps, for she did not start, but answered simply, "No, sir;" and  her voice, too, trembled, and was low and de- liciously soft. "I am glad to hear it, believe me," I stammered; "oh, believe me, I would not have hurt you for worlds." This was consummately ridiculous. I felt it so. Yet what to say next; 'tis but the first -step that costs. True; but here the first step was taken, and I could not make the second. tHad I wished it I could not have had a bet- ter opportunity to commence a conversation: it had been so easy to continue the apology ., 1 b     <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6684-00000041"/> 80     ' WILL IT COilIE? and slide imperceptibly into other subjects, till we should be at home with each other. Very easy to an indifferent speaker, but not to me,-.nlot then. And fool that I was, thrice-sodden fool, I added in a low voice, "But you have hurt me incurably;" and rushed from her side like lightning. I condemned myself over and over. I felt I had been a fool. What must she think? Women do so hate timidity in men, and my last words, so exquisitely, exquisite- ly ridiculous, puerile, novel-sentimental, I could have torn out my tongue. I reached home, heaven knows how, for I am sure I did not see my way, tore off my cravat, and sat down to cool myself. "I never can speak to her," I groaned; "I shall, only sink deeper. in folly; " and this was all the consolation my philosophy could extract from my defeat. I finally determined to write to her. The next day was Sunday. The proud beauty sat at a window on the ground-floor.   7WILL IT COME?1?   81 I could distinguish her behind the half-shut blinds. It was a warm morning, and the sash was up. How shall I get my note to her? A bouquet of roses stood upon a marble table in the centre of my study. I took one which was not quite blown, and hid mny little note, closely compressed, in the petals. The rose was put through the window, no matter by whose hand, - it was not by my own, -but very handily and very cau- tiously, and almost immediately rejected. It fell to the pavement. An honest citizen, ,just then passing, smooth-shaven and with white gloves, picked up the flower; and I know not whether the note went with it, to be conveyed, perhaps, to his astonished mistress or confounded wife, or whether Letitia had slyly stolen the honey ere she threw away the cup.  But I did not see i i  her for all the rest of that day, nor the next, nor yet again the next. She did :'l i "    <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6684-00000042"/> 82     IWILL IT COME? not go out either. I was vexed; I was angryr at her and myself; I was sick. The evening of the third day was all calm and moonshine. I perceived a figure in white seated at a certain window. My heart leapt. It must be her. I took my guitar. I had a songc and air I had been busy with all day. In  the quiet of the night, and the loneliness of the deserted street, she must hear me. I sung it.... It is not worth repeating here; the words were nothing extraordinary, and the music was neither Mozart's nor Rossini's." "Oh, yes, Sir John, please repeat the words, if you have them  at memory," I said, coaxingly, to my friend. "Tell, then, here they are, for I shall never forget them, as I can never forget any thing connected with that time and that girl: SONG. The dew reflects the light of stars: So let thy spirit mirror mine, And open all the pea:rly bars Through which my love may enter thine.   WILL IT COME?       83 Love sees thee linger in distrust, But burns his watch-fires still the same, And will till he is burned to dust, Or thine reflects the altar's flame. For he hath been by sorrow nursed, And sleepless, watched and plead so long, He now demands to know the worst, And sues thee in this simple song. His sky is dark and drear, indeed, With clouds of doubt thine eyes may rift; Oh, do not make him longer plead, But through the gloom thy glances lift. Those glances, oh! so full of heaven - If yes is in their love-lit beams: If no, my heart, my life is riven, And heaven itself a dream of dreams. Gathering courage as I proceeded, and feeling deeply all I sung, I had never sung, I thought, so well. As quite delighted with my own execution I hung over the instru- ment when I had finished, and straining my eyes to see if I could gather, in the imper- fect light, the effect I had produced; some    <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6684-00000043"/> 84     WILL IT COlIE? one approached with a candle in the room I was watching. I looked: good heavens! it was Lctitia herself. She it was who bore the candle; I had been singing to her old mother!                  - My admiration for the beautiful creature increased daily, from the simple fact that I indulged it daily. I thought of noth- ing else; by day I watched her, or watched for her, neglecting actually the ordinary wants of nature, to feed my dazzled eyes with beauty, and my sick  brain with fancy's fairy pictures; and when I retired for the night it was with hope to dream of her presence, and with certainty of waking to behold its loveliness. And Letitia too - or I deceived myself- began to kneel at the same shrine. At first,  like the almost imperceptible light gently suffusing up the heavens, or like the first downy softness of the dew-fall, scarcely felt or known, this new baptism of heaven fell upon her all untouched and stainless soul,   WILL IT COME       85 -a downy softness, a spell of paradise, a breath of roses. By-and-by it became a thought, and further on it crept into her veins and glanced along the unused nerves with a thrill whose newness was ecstasy to her youthful senses. And now, as I gazed from behind my window blinds, I could see how it fed and grew on fruits of fancy's planting, while hope gathered and threw them from couches of roses. I noted care- fully - and. the occupation was heaven - the dreams of rapture that hung on her expres- sion, the involuntary revery, the unbid- den sadness and listlessness succeeding, and then the re-awakened affections, the cheerful activity, the increased tender- ness, the uplifted glances, so full of heaven. But my fair neighbor came less frequently to the window, and retired sooner. I sus- pected indeed, and I believe with justice, that she was not really absent from her little sitting-room, but kept in the background    <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6684-00000044"/> 86      WILL IT COME? to observe if I would miss her and betray a longing for her re-appearance. When she did present herself, it was with evident embarrassment. She seemed conscious of being overlooked; and her motions were studied yet uneasy and abrupt. Occasion- ally I could detect a covert glance directed at my window, and withdrawn in some con- fusion, though there was nothing there to excite emotion, whatever she might fancy. At other times she was all pride and cold- ness, sitting demurely at her work with an affectation of indifference. Then the fond- ness for her little pet grew more con- spicuous. She would hold it in her lap for hours, look earnestly into its eyes, or kiss their lids, then clasp the child with sudden ardor to her breast, play with its soft small fingers, as if enamoured with their silky touch, or bending down press to its rosy mouth her own young lips, clinging there a moment as if she would inhale the innocent breath - and parting from it only   WILL IT COME?     87 to shower on cheek and neck and brow a storm of kisses, each softer, closer, more impassioned than the rest. All this said much; and its effect on me - need I men- tion it? I watched my opportunity. It came. It was a beautiful evening, and she' left the house alone. I joined her. I poured into her ear a volley of the nmost unintelligible nonsense, - I know not what; but I remem- ber well I was so agitated I could scarcely articulate, and * that instead of acting as though I were about the most ordinary and proper affair in the world, I deprecated her resentment; thus reminding her that I was taking an unwarrantable liberty, and that I looked for nothing more than to be rated for my presumption. What could she do with such a fool? Of course she bade him leave her. But her voice was more agita- ted even than my own. It spoke any thing but indifference, any thing but resentment. I felt it, but persisted. Again and again    <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6684-00000045"/> 88     tTtILL IT COiME? I heard her say, "I desire you will leave me, sir," more and more positive, till at last she said something I deemed offensive, and suf- fering myself to be worked into a rage, retorted like a fool and left her. Childhood! childhood! I exclaimed, al- most aloud, again and again, and walked my room  in utter discomfiture till long  after midnight. i1   CHAPTER   VI. S   not love, oh my friend, as well the love confirmed by habit and made rea- sonathle by esteem, as the momentary pas- sion,- is it not a moral intoxication, under which we are aware we stagger and talk thick, yet have no power to steady step or tongoue? I knew that no acknowledg- ment of symlpathy could be expected from my neighbor, for I held as an opinion that all women, especially the refined, where the heart is put to commerce with the heart of men, are shy, even false, in spite of them- selves. I knew; besides, and credited, as I do still, the proverb which tells us that the fortress which parleys, and the woman who listens, will both surrender. I knew all this, yet when the time for action came about, invariably my feelings gave my knowledge    <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6684-00000046"/> 90     TWILL IT COM1E? the slip, and left her just behind to chafe and. murmur at their progress. I could easily imagine how stood the little world within Letitia all this time. New- born Love, scarce conscious of his own existence, lay struggling with the help- lessness of infancy, and moved his little limbs for help, while Vanity, Timidity, and Prudence were jarring and distracting the kingdom with their rival claims, masters as well as ministers to the baby monarch. No suggestions of vanity led me to sup- pose this state of mind for my fair neighbor. Vanity is a weakness which, I may safely say, never ruled my counsels when women were in question. I knew too well that this puzzling sex seldom admire but where they are admired, and never offer love till a similar present has been made them in form, -sometimes not even then.  Letitia would doubtless have preferred me to a monster, but had the monster held a mirror to her eyes, while John Franklin kept one   WILL IT COIE?      91 merely for his own, the monster must have proved the luckier man. "Beauty and the Beast" has more than one moral. It was  not self-flattery, then, which fathered my belief. So fir indeed I was firom being satisfied that Letitia really lovedc me, I usually destroyed one day the struc- ture of assurance I had raised the preceding, and laid by night the foundations that were sure to vanish on the morrow.  In short, while my observation and my judgment inclined me to believe, the intensity of my feelings made be suspicious; .and knowing the innate art of woman as I did, and being so very sensitive and diffident in my own nature, I indulged hope most warily, I assure you. And so I oscillated between faith and hopelessness, and Letitia vacillated amongst more points than she could count or I ac- count for,--till one evening, some months after the event alluded to some minutes past, she had an unusual concourse of friends at    <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6684-00000047"/> 92     WTIILL IT CO ME? tea. with her, both male and female.  En- sconcedl behind the window of the dining- room, I looked into my neighbor's little parlor, and watched 'the whole proceedings of the party. It was not merely to contem- plate Letitia's beauty thaLt I played the spy upon her actions, but through a solicitude which I was constantly indulging, of dis- covering aught in her behavior that should either confirm my high  opinion of her character, or, showing me I was deceived, dissipate at once my fond delusion. All went well at first.  The beautiful girl's elegant figure showed to great advant- age as she moved about in quality of hostess, and her manners appeared to my partial judgment to be far above her position in life. I was vexed, however, that she should be gay,--forgetting that I could be gay myself in company, yet think of her the while,--and consequently I was not in the best of humor to witness the many little liberties that pass between the sexes in that sphere and time of life.    WILL IT COME?     93 Presently one of the young men attempted to snatch a kiss from Letitia. She escaped, and ran round a table ,which was in the centre of the room. I followed the chase with my eyes, my heart beating the while as if it would break its prison. Suddenly she darted from the room; the street door opened, and I saw her rush out with the impertinent behind her. To spring after them was the work of a moment. I had no object, nothing but an insensate and indefinite jealousy to urge me to this mad extent of folly. They stopped before a church at no great distance. The boy attempted no liberty, and as I had had the selise to clap a hat upon my head, passed me without suspicion. For a long minute I leaned against the iron rails of the church- fence, and was sick to faintness. I relate this petty instance to evidence the passion of my love and the strength of the feeling which blinded me for this charm- ig girl.    <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6684-00000048"/> 94   1WItILL IT COME r The next day I bade adieu to my loved study and my post at the window, and set out for the country. It was late in autumn when I returned. As I anticipated, her dear eyes still had power over me. I had not ceased to hope, 1and so I could not deny myself the luxury of watching the beautiful girl when, resting on her arm, she would sit for many minutes gazing thus, with a melancholy tenderness of appeal in her whole manner that seemed to say to me, Can you be angry with mle? can you, do you, blame me for what I did not with my own will? I reeled in the intoxication of the pleasure; but my pride arose, and I felt still doubtful whether I might not be exposed to fresh confusion. It was late in autumn on an afternoon which threatened rain. I was returning from a solitary walk, when my attention was drawn to a young and well-dressqd girl who was endeavoring to escape the imlportunities of a drunken wretch who,   WILL IT CO IE?     95 staggering about her, was peering inso- lently under her bonnet. It was Letitial I came up with them just when the fellow had actually contrived to hem her in against a wall, as you have seen a player at draughts confine a weak antagonist in a corner of the draught-board. The frightened girl stretched out her arms to me, and implored my aid in a tone of delighted relief that made my heart leap. I flung the obscene brute into the kennel, walked a step or two beside her in silence, and then said, "The way is clear now. I will leave you." "Yes, thank you," she replied, stammer- ing, "I can go alone now; I don't-think it will rain." Rain?  Was this a hint?  The drops were indeed beginning to fall. How could I help offering my umbrella, and holding it over her? Not a word was said. We walked close, so close together that we touched. It could not be avoided. The contact made me thrill    <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6684-00000049"/> QG    TWILL IT COME W? through and through, even to shivering. Letitia timidly shrank from me. Her bosom rose and fell tumultuously beneath the mod- est shawl that wrapped it, and betrayed her agitation to increase my own. Had I spoken, it would have been better: silence gives such scope to thought. Letitia's con- fusion grew still greater.  She stumbled, anmd would have fallen but for my support. "I see," I said, with trembling, "that I must lend you my assistance, whether you will or no. And why not??" I added low, as I gently passed within my own the lovely arm I still retained "why not, Miss Tishey ? Chance has made us neighbors, and Fate seems to will that we shall be friends. Why not yield to her direction? " As usual with me, I was getting on too fast. My companion drew her arm firom mine, and seemed about to leave me. I took the warning in time; changed the subject artfully, and for the rest of the way, which I took care should have no  WILL IT COME?      97 short cuts, we were  excellent companions. Tlhe beautiful creature! so shy, so silent; but oh, how eloquently she listened! I need not detail how next we met, nor how from passively receivinlg my attentions Letitia bgean to respond to them, nor how from meeting, apparently without design, we soon forgot this compliment to delicacy, and found the termination of one interview regularly inviting to   the appointment of the next; but I must relate how she was taught my sentiments of love and marriage, my intentions, etc., and   what  reception they encountered. One moonlight evening, wven we had met as usual, I proposed that we should take a walk in the Park. The disclosure which I meditated was trembling on my lips, and the lateness of the season  promised the perfect solitude I  needed to carrythroug h my purpose. The solemn  stillness, the holy light which streamed  at intervals    along  the avenues;    <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6684-00000050"/> WILL IT CoME? the trees whose dark masses closed them in, swelling in full and beautiful relief against the brilliant heaven; the shaaows which stretched diagonal across the path, grotesque and huge, and opening here and there in spots of light; the paintive mur- rnur of the leaves, which seemed to mourn their coming dissolutio, and made the freeaom from all sounds of living things the deeper stilness,--all invited to voluptu- ous languor, and moved the mindto rerie of love; yet I came there to dissipate t'e soft delusion, and chec the hasty current which surged and surged in both our hearts, almost to suffocation. "Do you remember,"  I said to Letitia, when  e hid walke  for some time in silence, do you remember what I hinted at some months ago, near the first of our acquaintance?" No reply; but the arm tht lay in me trembled little, anl forgetful of the night, prthe pou head roope , d looked tovards   WILL IT COME?      99 the ground, in. a natural effort to conceal emotion. "Pardon me, that Itappear to be two persons in a single individuality, but-" "Sir?- H let us return, if you please," said my companion.. "No, not yet, please,-for it is necessary that we understand each other.. It would be dishonorable in. me any longer to with- hold, from you my real intentions as respects our future intercourse." Here my companion, with that suscepti- bility which I had observed on sundry former occasions, became much agitated, almost dragging me along with her in the rapidity of her unequal step, and trembling exces- sively. For myself, finding the matter, when once begun, more easily managed than I had looked for, I continued with all the firmness I could desire. "Marriage, as at present understood and entered into,. is, in my. opinion, a failure. I have carefully conned the statistics so    <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6684-00000051"/> O0     RWILL IT COI ME?  ar as they have been, and perhaps can be at present, ascertained, and I have, besides my own observations, seriously counselled with a number of persons imuch more expe- rienced, and of course much wiser, than myself, and I have come to the conclusion just now worded to you, with an unaltera- ble determination that when I am married --for I believe in the institution most solemnly--it shall be a verity-a success. And for this purpose I propose first to learn myself, heeding the injunction of the Greeks, --excuse the seeming pedantry,- Inothi se orton ecelo decezded, -'Know thyself is a law descended of heaven.' Hav- ing conquered this little world of my own, I propose for my second campaign the thorough exploration of yours, not with a view to its subjugation as the laws of these realms allow and the Gospel sanctions, but with the higher and holier aim of annexa- tion. At the same time I desire - nay, it is one of the articles of agreement--that you   IILL IT COIME?     101 investigate the entire realm over which and in which I reign, till you know all its weak- ness and all its errors, if not all its virtues and beauties if there are any to be learned in the new and all untried kingdom I possess. Then, after this most important work shall have been accomplished, I propose, as a third item of investigation, the institution of marriage itself -that is, if we find the two kingdoms are fitted, or can be fitted, to keep the unity of the spirit in the bonds of peace. For this threefold investigation, seemingly almost infinite, or at least the work of a life- time, how many years - nay, do be patient, you have no cause for anger- how many years shall we need of courtship? "The folly of follies, in my opinion, nay, 'the mistake of a lifetime,' is this hurrying to conclusions, this mania for sucking sudden sweetness, this giddy eagerness to realize, to consummate. Think for a moment, my pre- cious friend, how happy, how soulful happy, we now are. Why hurry to a consumma- *   W    <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6684-00000052"/> 102     WILL IT COlIE? tion? How call marriage be purer, loftier, holier, than this union of soul that enwraps us as a mantle of heaven? Of course we are most carefully to watch, guard against, and subjugate the lower to the sustenance and elevation of the higher natures with which  we are gifted." "I  I do not understand you, sir, - I - I do not. It is growing late-let us go. Let me go, Mr. Kingman." "Nay, but a moment longer, I will return with you thenl; only listen to me till you do understand me. I will explain. I am too extravagant, perhaps. I will be plainer. You will listen to me, and believe me sin- cere at least, and trust me: will you not? I know my ideas are new to you, as they are, doubtless, to most people, and will be for ages yet to come; but if they frighten you now, the more necessary is it that you listen till you know all, and thoroughly weigh as in a balance every sentiment I have to utter to you.   WILL IT CCOME?    103 "You know I have long loved you,- how sincerely and tenderly let your own heart bear testimony. Never was purer, more disinterested affection felt by man for woman, than that I bear to you. It looks for no gratification at the expense of your honor or your happiness; it seeks for no advantage but by and through your own. Among my first day-dreams,f rom my earli- est recollections, I nourished the idea of one day meeting with some lovely and gentle being of -your own sex, whose mind twin-spirit of my own - I might fashion on a like model, until she was become a second self, - a counterpart of my own essence in a brighter mould. I had no thought of special bodily union, - of the ordinary mar- riage, or its conditions and r'esults I thought with rapture of our thought-inter- course, our heart-communioi; I dwelt in fancy on the close intimacy of our spirits, when I should have ttauht her all the se- cret knowledge of my own mind, -when I    <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6684-00000053"/> 104     WILL IT COME? should have opened to her wondering eyes the treasures of my reason and imagrination, and bid her share them with me, - for they were all hers. I hung in pictured ecstasy on the breathing of her praise,-not for one moment, oh, believe me, on the touch, even the slightest, most delicate, that which Shakspeare says 'is to be bought with life.' Oh, no! I watched with fancied intoxication of delight the glow of admiration on her cheek, and the fire of reciprocated feeling in her eye. I did not even dream of the 'em- bracing and embraced.' I was satisfied, happy, bliss-full, in contemplating Genius struggling into birth, and reigning triumph- ant on her forehead; to witness Love, yet young and all aglow with his baptismal of heavenly dew, animating each sparkling feat- ure. It was enough to clasp the expanded, kindled, awakened spirit to my own, and find them grown immortal, - without the faintest desire for the temple in which we communed, or the shrine where we knelt in worship.   WILL IT COME?    105 to Letitia, when I gazed on thee, and read in thy expressive beauty that these vis- ions might at length be realized, do you wonder that I spread my arms?-oh, no, not my arms,--do you wonder that my soul leapt to meet your own? Tell me, do you understand? You are silent. You have not thought. How could I have expected it,- you are so young, so inexperienced. The whole world thinks so differently. But oh, I will teach thee, precious, more than in thy fondest aspiration thou couldst ever dream to know; and thou shalt believe, be- cause the teachers shall be the impassioned lips of love -I will discourse to thee of these mysteries. I will, by unfolding the in- most cabinets and dustiest recesses of man's dark heart, show the real meaning and divine beauty of self-denial,--that self-denial of which so much is said, but so little practised, especially in married life. I will, with thought's keen dissecting knife, open up to your wondering eyes, from time to time, 5*    <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6684-00000054"/> 106     WILL IT COME? each string of this marvellous instrument,-- which does not 'keep in tune so long,' but which is so wretchedly out of tune most of the time. I will show you, part by part, all the wondrous and exquisitely fine valves, pipes, stops, keys, etc, and explain how the great life-discordance is produced; or mount- ing with thee nigher heaven, with what rap- ture will I show, not how the eternal stars roll on their courses, as Newton foolishly spent his sublime thoughts in doing, to the neglect of the higher heavens to be unfolded to the gaze of man; nor like Moses will I tell thee how the plastic hand of Omnipotence swept together through the illimitable ether the senseless particles that made the mass of chaos, from whose fated coalescence the round world rose in the abysm, the soil put forth her varied vegetation, and countless tribes of procreative beings swarmed vivacious in the new-hung sphere. Oh, no! I will enter, instead, the very Kingdom itself, which is within you, my pet, -and I will show   WILL IT uE?     107 you how this same benifilent haid is mould- ing from the seemingly seiseless particles of clay taken in with the food you eat, and vitalized into the pabulem vite, or essence of life, by the; air you inhale, the thoughts that breathe, the woids that burn, and the deeds that live; And what further joy to show thee, not only all the processes by which ignorance, called depravity, thwarts or prevents the higher thought, the purer word, the nobler deed; but in the same light, the scientific and sure methods by which this human soil flowers into intellect like Shakspeare's, and fruits into lives like that of Jesus; or-but I am talking wild in my enthusiasm. "Tell me, Tishey my dear Tishey may I not say?- tell me, may not all this be? Shall we not reserve these bodies-I am solemnly in earnest, my dear girl - shall we not reserve them, sacredly, to some day far off in the magnificent future? Do you un- derstand me? I will marry your soul, - or,    <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6684-00000055"/> 108     WILL IT COME? rather, we will marry our souls, just as fast as we discover we have any to join in the holy rite. Here and now before all the holy angels, on bended knee, I ask heaven to witness :"- I had clasped the dear girl's hand in mine; and in the ardor of my warm, gushing na- ture, I passed about her little waist the arm I had at liberty, - she too kneeling, - and there, in that lonely grove, girt with silence and with night, the eternal stars, as so many approving angels, witnessed our bridal the marriage of two souls who had given in solemn oath their bodies as living sacrifices unto God, till the day of redemption; when they should be presented pure and holy, and acceptable unto him.   CHAPTER   VII. VTOW all was joy within my breast. Leti- tia's mind proved what I had imagined it, and though her temper was quick, at times exceedingly difficult to manage, yet on the whole she was so elevated and soft of soul, so winning from the sweetness of her affection and the music of her voice, that I drew almost unmixed delight from every inter- view; the more so that her naturally arbi- trary and haughty disposition was yielding gradually and involuntarily to the influence of my stronger and still more imperious spirit. Well, then," said my spirit-bride, as we were leisurely strolling in the same park and beneath the same stars that had wit- nessed our bridal, "well my, my Sir John Franklin" (I could feel her thrill at the    <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6684-00000056"/> "O     WILL IT COME? pronunciation of my name), "now   that you have taught me such wonderful things about myself--and, by the way, this new lecturer - what is his name? - Dr. -Dr. -- -or -, oh, yes, that's the name, - in his private lectures to ladies, has told us nearly or about the same things, and I was so glad to see explained scientifically, and illustrated so plainly, what you in your lov- ing enthusiasm so eloquently taught mnp in your metaphysical and poetic way; but when will you give me the higher lessons of which you speak, and tell me all about my fortune, my future? for since I have known you, I feel my own ignorance so keenly that- that-" I put my finger tenderly on her beautiful lip, and finished the sentence for her -" that you are nearly lost in the mysteries, Letitia! I understand, and, as your rightful teacher and guardian under heaven, will lead you forth as fast as possible." A turn in the walk led us into the most sequestered and   WILL IT COME?

Kingman was now the same composed and stately being I had seen him on previous occasions. It struck me, however, that there was a graver shade upon his brow - graver and deeper than I had seen it yet wear - as Letitia Percival, aglow with the warmth of exercise, sparkling in every feat- ure with the enthusiasm of the scenery, and animated as I had never seen her before with poetic fervor as though inspired almost to rapture, fixed her lustrous eyes upon his for a brief moment, and then burst forth in the following -    <pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6684-00000058"/> "4      WILL IT COL2E?

While Letitia Percival had been uttering this strange improvisatore, she seemed al- most transfigured before us. Her beautiful figure seemed to expand, and in the rosy rays of the setting sun to glow with a beauty not of earth; her eyes dilated, and burned and 6    <pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6684-00000062"/> 122     IILL IT COME? sparkled under her pale brow, as you have sometimes seen star-gushes through silvery clouds; her nut-brown locks, clustering and waving adown her neck, seemed instinct and breathing with the emotions that rose and fell in her bosom; and her voice -oh, it was so deep, deep and rounded,- and yet so mellow and musical, and delicate as the whis- pering of the zephyrs from whose wings she drank in, as though direct from the lips of angels, the burning words I have tried, but all in vain, correctly to report. I have only given a poor earthly or material rendering of what seemed a divine message, -a mes- sage or song or what you will, that no mor- tal pen can transcribe, and which never yet fell from mortal lips. Her listeners were not only spell-bound, transfixed as by some magic, but caught up, inspired, and each seemed floating in a new- hung sphere; each saw visions, and heard, or thought they did, the rustling of invisible wings, and the hymning of invisible spirits.   WILL IT COME?     123 When she had ceased, and stood there a liv- ing, animated, real body- and not a spell from heaven-not a disembodied spirit among the white-robed hosts, but one of our own number, bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh, we could hardly believe our own eyes; and wlien we really did, we hardly credited our own ears, thinking perhaps we had all been asleep, dreaming dreams. Not a word was uttered. In silence, a silence that was more eloquent than words, we descended the romantic and winding path, feeling, each step of the slow and dreamy way, that we were leaving the mount of vis- ion and of heaven, for the common life of the common world.    <pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6684-00000063"/> a I   CHAPTER   IX. T DO not know a more difficult character to describe than one's self; so I will not undertake the description or the delineation of this veritable personal pronoun, "Leland Searcher," who is, by the reader's leave, to occupy a few pages in this book while he acts as reporter to the main characters of the drama herein enacted, but will just hand him over to my friend, Sir John Franklin King- man, whose reporter -I am, and who knows this Searcher better than he knows himself. It is but fair that he should not only furnish the portrait of his reporter to the readers of this volume, but also the brief history of his heart, so far as it is to have a place in these * pages. Certainly one good turn deserves another, or "sirminia silibus," as the globule profession say.    <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6684-00000064"/> 126     WILL IT COME? . Please remember then, oh reader, that Leland Searcher tells his story only to Frank, who in turn tells it only to you, thus betray- ing my confidence to the public, as I have his thus fir, and as I mean to continue to do as long as he will be so silly as to confide, and I am his -reporter. Hear the man, just hear him:- Did I imitate certain writers, who think that the whole art of portraying individual character is to seize hold of some prominent peculiarity, and to introduce this distinguish- ing trait in all times and in all scenes, I should find no difficulty in painting my re- porter's portrait to his heart's content. I should only have to present to the reader a man whose manners were civil or rude, famil- iar or distant,'just as the whim seized him; and whose conversation, like his features, was irregular, abrupt, and sharply defined. This would, however, be rendering injustice to the character which I wish introduced to   WILL IT CO ME      127 the reader; for there were times when Leland Searcher was earnestly, deeply engrossed, either in thought, in love, or in discus- sion, which redeemed this angularity of character somewhat, and  smoothed  the sharp outlines into gracefulness so com- pletely that some beholders estimated him as much higher as others, judging  from the surface only, held him lower than he justly deserved. His erudition was rather miscellaneous than profound. His memory of facts - not of names or dates   was perfectly surprising for its fidelity and ex- tent. He was a severe critic, who had a peculiar art of quoting from each author he reviewed or speaker he reported, some part tlhat told the whole in a light so true and a spirit so just, that it was irresistible in con- viction and acceptable as a judgment. Like most men, in the theory of philosophy he was intolerably rigid, - in its practice, more than tolerably loose. By his tenets, you would have considered him a very Cato for    <pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6684-00000065"/> 128     TVILL IT. CO3IE? stubbornness and sternness; yet he was a very child in his concession to the whim of the moment. Fond of meditation and re- search, he was still fonder of imparting the results achieved by either; but while he was one of the most instructive in public, he was hardly tolerable in private, unless every eye and ear gave attention and every heart throbbed in sympathy to his discourse, or in some way flattered his self-esteem. His great want in society was that utter forgctfulness of self which is the chief charm of manners, - that rare gift, by-the-bye,. so difficult to define, but how much more difficult to attain, and how far more desirable as a possession than wealth, beauty, or talent. "No atten- tion is too minute, no labor too exa ggerated, which tends to perfect them; for he who enjoys their advantages in the highest de- gree, that is, he who can please, penetrate, persuade, as the object may require, pos- sesses the subtlest secret of the diplomatist and the statesman, and wants nothing but opportunity to become gTeat."   WILL IT COM3E      129 When alone with his friend, or one he imagined appreciative and just, his conceit took the tone and semblance only of a legiti- mate pride of worth; with the masses, it be- came grave, searching, and sarcastic. Many said his name and nature were well married. lHe was rather a contradictor than a favorer of ordinary opinions; and this perhaps made. him more enemies than lis clearness of mind, benevolence of heart, and the always restless, intense desire to do the world good, which was the real ambition of his life, gained him friends. In person, Leland Searcher was tall and rather lean, but not ungracefully so. His features, as we have said, were somewhat irregular and too sharply definec; yet the countenance, on the whole, though not fine, was passably fair and somewhat striking. A member of Congress, looking at his bust in one of the windows of the city, said "he should hate to fight that man ;" and this re- mark will more clearly convey to the reader's 6*          ;    <pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6684-00000066"/> 130     WTILL IT COME 2 mind the will, energy, strength, and sav- ageness withal, of his expression, than can ttay words of mine. His eyes were dlark, bright, deep-set, and penetrating; but his forehead, high and thoughtful, and resting as though uneasily at times beneath a mass of clustering and slighltly curling hair, together with the well-cut, generous, but not volup- tuous or sensual mouth, redeemed the sharp- ness of the eyes and the firmness of the almost too prominent chin from an expression of tyranny which they would otherwise wear. I-e dressed simply, plainly, paying no atten- tion to special show or richness in apparel, and yet carefully avoiding the other extreme of laxity in this regard. Iis usual garb was black from head to foot, always carrying but never wearing gloves, and usually accom- panying himself with some ordinary walking- stick. Add to these, when on public occa- sions, a white vest fresh and perfect from the laundress, and the portrait is complete. Few men, perhaps, could boast of a more   WILL IT COIE?     131 masculine mind, or a firmer purpose of soul, than Leland Searcher. His habits of soli- tude, as he has reported my own, had strengthened the natural hardihood of the one, and his conflict with the elements in the great battle of life, on the other hand, had drawn out and fortified the other; and thus the tone and faculty of the whole man could not but assume that rigorous energy seen always in his expression, already described, and which the habit of self-dependence al- most invariably produces. And yet the reader, if he be young, will scarcely feel surprise that the resolution of Searcher, formed in early life and maintained so many years, to battle against incipient love, and never to marry so long as he could possibly help it, so quickly melted away when the proper fuel was kindled upon the right altar, and that the flame burnt the more brightly in proportion to the resistance which it en- countered. Searcher was in his mature but still youthful years; all the solid and con-    <pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6684-00000067"/> 132      TVILL IT COME? centrated faculties ripened to their full height, no longer capable of the infinite de- tractions, the numberless caprices of youth; the 1rays of the heart, not rendered weak by diversion, had collected in one burning focus; and the feelings, never frittered away by previous indulgence, were yet fresh as well as matured. Searcher too had just arrived at that age when a man usually feels a sort of revulsion in the current of his desires, when he met the beautiful Jessie of whom he has been telling me, and to whom, together with his always-idolized sister, and his unworthy friend, he addressed the following lines some time aoo, lbut .which he will never forgive my introductig! here, I am quite sure -ani yet here they are :- As dear to me as friend can be Is my sweet sister Lessie; But heaven itself; without my elf, My guardian-angel Jessie, Would really seem a worthless dream, And lose its power to bless me.   WILL IT COME?      133 And Sir John Frank - the good I've drank From his great soul hath won me; But the whole earth would not be worth One thought, if Jessie'd shun me; And I should die if her sweet eye Refused its light to sun me. Oh, how I prize her blessed eyes, And her sweet smile of heaven! Let all that's best to her bequest From this full soul be given, As proof that her one worshipper All other ties hath riven. I do not say that you must pray Each time that you may near her; And yet I'm sure she is so pure, That men should almost fear her, And feel that heaven contains not seven 'Mong all its seraphs dearer. God understood that to be good, He must an angel send me, And how she will from every ill And tempting power defend me, And with the great in heaven's estate Of spirit-riches blend me!    <pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6684-00000068"/> 134     WILL IT C0ME? My spirit springs, on love's swift wings, With each sweet day's returning, And greets ye three most tenderly, At friendship's altar burning The one watch-fire that ne'er'll expire Till heaven is clothed in mourning! Shall I tell you how I became acquainted with Jessie, mySir John? I sat sketching on the very spot we have just left, when you told me of your beginning in life, up on the mountain - how long ago it does not matter -when a party (two ladies and one gentle- man) came winding their way up the craggy steeps. It was the same that I had met on one of the mountain slopes a few days pre- vious. When I had recognized them, I bent down my head not to betray the pleasure which I felt at our re-encounter, and resumed my occupation.  When they had satisfied their galze from this point, and which is one of the finest on or around the mountains, the younger of the ladies expressed her doubts of being able to visit all the scenes, declaring   WILL IT COME?     135 she was so tired she could not climb further. "'Pardon the liberty," I said, approaching them respectfully; "if you will do me the honor to accept my service, the ascent may be made easier, or at least possible, and '- I was interrupted with a blush from the younger, and a compliment from the elder lady (Jessie's mother), and a "Thank you, sir,' from the gentleman (the brother of Jessie). Our previous meeting was alluded to, and gracefully opened an acquaintance which was henceforth but I must not an- ticipate. Presently we passed on and up, till we camne to an eminence that commanded one of the noblest views in the world. Donnel, the brother, walked forward with altl supported his mother; and with a de- light unqualified by any thought or feeling of earth, I devoted myself to Jessie. Iow I blessed the rugged way which ren- dered my support so necessary; and with what trembling eagerness I lent my arm or hand to bear her up from falling! I touched    <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6684-00000069"/> 136     WILL IT COiE? her, touched her hand - Jessie's; I felt the delicate pulse beat tremulously to mine through the glove which covered the soft, sliogllt fingers. We stopped. SWe were within sight of Maldam Zellier and Donnel -but far enough to feel that we were actually alone together. "Shall we sketch this view?"I asked, after we had really taken breath; "yet per- haps it would but spoil our pleasure. Do you not think so, Miss Zellier?" "Yes. When a landscape has real beauty. that is new to me, I care not to copy it at first. It is only when the enjoyment is past that I think of transferring its memory to paper. She was silent, and looked forward on the scene,- a scene so glorious, reader, to one who gazes upon it alone even, that no pen can describe it, - especially to one who climbs the path at early dawn. The lake in miniature from horn to horn of its crescentic course; towns, villages, and hamlets; ridges   WILL IT COME?     137 on ridges of mountains here tufted to the very peaks with giant firs, there rearing their bald gray heads, stern and unblenching il the very front of heaven; all seen below, before him, softly remote, sublimely proxi- mate. Lo! the thin vapor scuds between it and his eye -the mist gathers from the valleys and the mountain sides, and enwrap him like a mantle; he sees nothing but the ground beneath his feet, while the driving shower suddenly descends like a cataract- but as suddenly bursts forth the sun, rolling the gray wreath before it like a veil slowly raised from the face of beauty, revealing the landscape in dazzling magnificence. With such a scene before me, and with her beside me, the sky all beauty, the air all balm, need I say that I was eloquent? The brain felt the stimulus of pleasure free friom doubt; and language flowed with a rapidity, a fervor, and a coloring from fancy that sur- prised even myself. Jessie listened in deep silence, and seemed to feel it was- her pres- ence which inspired.    <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6684-00000070"/> 138     WILL IT CO E? "See," I said, "see, Miss Zellier, how beautifully the setting sun tinges the snowy summit yonder!" "Beautifully," replied Jessie: "the love- liest color of a newly opened rose, the inner side of the leaf." "Do you return home very soon?" "Yes," said Jessie, with some surprise at the abruptness of the question: we have been waiting for some time the return of friends from the West. They are expected almost immediately. The day they arrive we shall be ready to proceed with them to Philadelphia." "And as the rose-tints we are now admir- ing, so will be your recollections, if at all agreeable, of our brief, how brief! acquaint- ance. Mark, even while I speak they are gone, and the scene is left all cold and colorless as before. But I," I continued hastily, fearing to be interrupted by Jessie, if not by the party we were awaiting, and who were now close at hand, " but I, Miss   WILL Ii COME?     139 Zellier, if I may be permitted to say it, I am like the sun which gives those evanescent tints: in a moment he will have disappeared, but he will carry with him, out of sight and in the distance, the same fires with which he is burning, now, and even here will rise again on the morrow, to shine with undiminished warmth upon the scene of yesterday." Carry the metaphor a little further, Mr. Searcher, and it will be more perfect; for the sun will touch again the cold mountain top with his rays of beauty, and- " she was in- terrupted by the other members of the party joining us; but oh, that glow of reflected passion on her beautiful cheek, momentary as it was, finished the figure, and told my heart more than words could. Of course I could no longer intrude, and we separated, with some pretty but trifling acknowledgments on the ladies' part, of my brief courtesy. Ah, when I had returned to my hotel, how little relish did I find in the commonplace    <pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6684-00000071"/> "O     TtILL IT CO ME? society of the other visitors at this celebrated resort! I was not yet in love with this won- drous beauty of the mountain-path, nor was I about to be, as I thought; but she inter- ested me; she had touched my imagination; I had marked the blush upon her cheek; I had leaned over a height, and pleased myself with growing dizzy; I had drank of the misused wine, and its effects were intoxica- tion; not yet the head-ache, heart-ache, or delirium. Some seventeen or eighteen months from this time I was in Philadelphia. There was a void in my life when this beautiful spirit had disappeared, who had made it a mnomen- tary heaven, which I knew not how to fil. To see her once more, if only for a momenlt, to learn her fatc, was the necessity of my very existence. The second day after my arrival I suc- ceeded in finding the residence of an old friend, the most prized of all of my college- class.   WILL IT COM1IE     141 "A fine house," I thought, as I looked through the window of the carriage, while the driver thereof rang the door-bell; its heavy architecture and stone-faced portal, how like the father of my old chum!"Not at home, sir." The driver handed my card, and I left the door with the most singular and uncomfortable feelings I had ever expe- rienced. A shock, as of electricity, seemed -to pass over me, and thrilled through and through every fibre of my being, till my body seemed to drop away, and leave me an entire spiritual essence; then every thing grew dim, and appeared to swim round with me; and for a moment I seemed to be nowhere .and nothing, yet still conscious of existence; and then I felt as if I were waking from a dream in the interior of a church; the priest ready by the altar, and Jessie and I upon the altar steps in bridal attire. Yes, thus it was; the pointed win- dows, the pillared aisles, the railed-in chan- cel. But the roof appeared to be the tops of    <pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6684-00000072"/> "2     WILL IT COME ' lofty mountains, white with snow or dark with nodding foliage; and there was no light other than that dim, mysterious twilight atmosphere, sunless alike and moonless, which usually surrounds one in a cream, and through it the form of the priest was but indistinctly visible, as in outline, and even her who stood beside me, habited a bride, I rather felt than saw to be Jessie. The cere- iony commenced, and I said to Jessie, "ShaIll iwe scktch this vieu?" and Jessie answered, "Yes : let us go," and the question and its answer seemed meet for the occasion. Then the church was in a blaze of light, and the priest, behold, he was my chum, my college friend! Around his neck was a diamond necklace, which gradually changed into the white arms of Jessie; on his breast began to appear, in a raidance that was dazzling, the pale, spiritual likeness of Jes- sie's face and head, which he was about to christen his wife; for his right hand was dipped in the font, and I saw the letters "My   WILL IT COlME?    143 wife" written in gold and purple on his hand and on his brow. In an instant the scene was changed. I was in a strange apartment. On my arm lay Jessie, like one that had fainted, white as a sheet, her fair hair all dishevelled, and her arms dropped helplessly beside her. By the door stood a tall man, the noblest of the race, one loved by me and honored. It was my chum, Ellery Nowell! His right hand was lifted from the font (which was still beside him), and covered his averted face, while the left pointed fixedly to the burden I supported. He did not speak or move, but the tears rolled down over his cheeks, and each drop seemed a letter full of all the hues of the rainbow, andc they rolled along to my feet and up my breast, and coiling round the lifeless body of Jessie, in regular order, arranged themselves thus: "Take her: her soul is yours, why should I keep her body?" Then a superhuman strength seemed to animate my arms, to thrill my blood, to lift    <pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6684-00000073"/> "4     WILL IT COME? and inspire my soul; and I started, I sprang forward; I cried out in my exultant joy, "Mine! mine!" "What did you say, sir?" asked the driver, flinging open the door of the car- riage; " here is your hotel, sir." I was not returned to my hotel an hour, when the porter announced "Mr. ozowell." "Searcher," said a voice I had always liked too well to have forgotten; and, turning round, was folded in Ellery's arms with a warmth that was the more delightful as being unexpected. "My dear fellow, when did you arrive?" "Only the day before yesterday. You see I've not forgotten you." "Thank you. It was such an agreeable surprise to me to find your card. By-the- bye, my dear fellow, I've a double surprise keeping warm for you. Do you know you have two acquaintances where perhaps you expected to find but one?" "Ah?"   WILL IT COME?     145 "I found Mrs. Nowell with your card in her hands, and she claims you for an acquaintance." What! Mrs. Nowell, your mother? I don't know that I've ever met her." "No, no : haven't you heard the news, that your fridnd has a dear ally and second self? But keep your curiosity, my friend, till to-morrow, when I shall have you to dine with me. I meant to take you home with me to-day, but Mrs. Nowell is suddenly quite indisposed." After an  hour's conversation, Nowell arose, and fixing the hour for the mor- row's visit, descended the stairs, bidding me adieu in high spirits. Turning his head a moment, however, he said, in his low silvery tones, "Oh, let me give you a hint to whet your curiosity: "Shall we sketch this view?" /  Had he looked back when he reached the bottom, he would have seen me, at the head of the staircase, aghast and motionless, 7    <pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6684-00000074"/> "6     WILL IT COME? like one just awakened from some horrid dream. Jessie! Could it be?  Jessie married! Jessie married to Nowell! .Jessie married to my friend! My God! this was a stroke! This, then, was the meaning of the vision in the coach. Till that moment I knew not that I loved her. My card in her hand,-taken suddenly ill! Can it be? She -does she love me? She does! Oh, my friend, what have you robbed me of? . . . But she married him - who forced her to do so? Free to choose - not eighteen months - fool! conceited fool! what right had I to fancy? Mere suspicion -too un- well to see company! Just like a woman! Sick for me! Idiot! idiot! And walking about in my agitation I repeated the epithet of self-reproof, aloud, "Idiot! idiot!" "Did you call, sir?" asked a waiter, open- ing the door. The spell was broken.   WILL IT COME?     147 Jessie, then, was married. Why not? Why should I feel surprised and hurt at this event? Had I ever declared love to her? Had she anticipated that I ever would present her with such a compliment? No, no: I'll think no more of her. What has she done but what she should have done? Handsome, honorable, of good family, in good circumstances, -all this he is. Can I blame her? But then, how can I visit her? I must not: I should smother to see her blooming in his garden and he intoxicated with the perfume. It would be better for me to leave town. ... But what would Nowell think?  What strange  suspicion might it not suggest? And so -I made the visit. I was shown into a room in which there were two ladies, both of whom rose as I entered, and one of them sprang into my arms: it was my sister, my sister Lessie. The other was indeed Jessie. She was thinner than when I saw her at    <pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6684-00000075"/> "8     TWTILL IT CO 3IE P the mountains, and I thought paler, though her complexion was naturally so extremely fair that I could scarcely have observed any change of this kind had not fancy been at hand to help me; certainly her manner was collected, and if my ears were not too par- tial in persuading me that her voice trem-  bled, the agitation was but momentary, and so slight that it must have been impercep- tible to any but one who expected it. Selfish wretches that we are! though I had dreaded the first interview lest some token of remembrance should call up feelings that I would conceal even if I could not smother them, yet it was with a pang of disappointment and mortified vanity that I listened to her gentle welcome and kind recurrence to our former brief meeting at the mountains; and my confusion thereupon grew so great that I could scarcely muster the commonest words of ceremony, and had reason to bless my star that nobody was by to witness it but Lessie.   '        szIL L ITT CO 3IE?  149 H-ow quiclly Jessie observed how it was with me! What woman was ever offended to find herself still living warm in a heart that she had even neglected or forgotten? As her eye met mine, when, raising them at the conclusion of my stammered reply  I looked into hers, Jessie blushed. "I thought," she said, turning directly to my sister and taking her hand affectionately, "I thought to prepare you a pleasant sur- prise, Mr. Searcher. Lessie and I, though very young in acquaintance, have grown quite old in friendship in your absence." "Though not so old, I trust, as to threaten change," I managed to reply; but I was thinking all the time that I was probably as much indebted to my sister's influence for my kind reception as to Nowell's friendship; and my heart bounded as I imagined these two gentle beings conversing of me in their private hours; knowing as I did how impos- sible it is for a sister's partiality to refrain from praising, and thus gain me favor in Jessie's eyes.    <pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6684-00000076"/> 150     WTILL IT CO 0IE  But what right had I to indulge this dan- gerous and traitorous feeling? I reeled at the thought. Soon after, Nowell entered the room, apologizing for his temporary absence. After the novelty of my visit was over, and with it the temporary excitement it occasioned, my friend Ellery had a soberness in his mien and a dignity in his expression, nay, a something more than this, which said, or seemed to say, that he was not exactly happy, and which was not the habitual melancholy I had been accustomed to remark in former years, in his eyes and lips, and which reigned there still. This idea acquired strength when I became con- vinced, as we sat at table, that Jessie's man- ner, though courteous, sweet, and gentle, drew not its color from the heart, b*ut was assumed from a sense of what was due to her husband and her guests. What could there be between them? and did I deceive myself? While he spoke to   II  -tPWILL IT COME?         151 Jessie in a tone which, though amiable, was one of simple form, or of ordinary courtesy, the same Ellery mingled in his manner to my sister a winning warmth, a delicacy of atten- tion, an unobtrusive yet watchful particular- ity in trifles which regarded her, that was almost affection and which was to me painfully perceptible. Was there to be another added to the thou- sand-and-one tales of connubial infelicity? At my desire, my sister took her seat be- side me in my carriage, and we drove to my hotel. "Lessie, how long have you known Mrs. Nowell?" Only this season, ny brother." "And Mr. Nowell-I think you knew him before his marriage? he spoke of you to me at the springs some two seasons ago." - Yes."  Yes, simply and timidly said, said much. I was surgical enough, I would say cunningly unfeeling, to probe deeper.    <pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6684-00000077"/> 152     WILL IT COME? "Indeed, lmy sister, I thought it was to be you, not Jes -not Miss Zellier." Not a word. No "Fie!" nor "Me?" nor "How can you say so!" of affected indiffer- ence or real levity-no empty giggle of flattered vanity such as silly women assume when they would have it thought they wish to hide their feelings, while in reality they have none to cover- nor yet the simple dis- claimer, or the exclamation of modest sur- prise, which had become my sister. Perfect silence. I saw that I had touched the seat of the disease, and found it deeper than the surface. "By-the-bye, Lessie, did you know I am an old acquaintance of your friend?" "Oh, yes, we used to talk of you very, very often- that is, I did, and Miss Zellier listened with such evident satisfaction, and blushed so, that I began to suspect the lady knew something of my brother's heart; so I rallied her on it a little one day, and do you hear, brother mine, or are you in a   WILL IT CO IE?     153 state of somnolency, sitting so silent there, as if you were turned into some Cardiff Giant? There, I will tell you no more, since you are so unsocial." "You  are facetious to-night, Lessie. What else had you to say?" "And you are very grave all at once, t:    Leland. However, it is no matter: I was only going to tell you some little suspicion of mine." "Ha! what! of Jessie, of-" "Well done, indeed, dear Leland! con- firmed before I have named it!" "Pshaw!" "That is all very right, to be sure, now Jessie is Mrs. Nowell; but let me tell you, Leland, had you seen somebody's color occa- sionally, you would have thought I was not very far out, in suspecting you had some place in that charming heart of hers." r;     Ts The non-response was now reciprocal. jI    "Lessie, here is my hotel; before we leave the carriage, answer me one question 7*    <pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6684-00000078"/> 154     WrILL IT COl IE  plainly. Do you believe that match-- Nowell's, I mean - a -happy one?" "Really - bother - I - I - why should it not be?" That is not answering my question: I do not ask you to violate any confidence, give me simply your opinion." "Then seriously, dear brother, I do not. But people say it is his nature to be sad, and perhaps - I did not let her finish the sentence. A good-night to Lessie, and then to my room, to the rack of mental question and torture. "A marriage of convenience!" I ex- claimed, or rather groaned within myself. O Jessie, Jessie! how have thy delicate spirit, gentle temper, sensitive heart, and almost divine beauty been sacrificed to cold- blooded speculation, made a matter of com- modity and bargain, perhaps!  Gracious heaven! is there not enough of misery in this world with our diseased bodies and dis- torted minds? Must the only pure emotion   WILL IT COME?     155 that is left to us surviving infancy, the first notes struck from the innocent, as yet un- tried heart, by the virgin touch of new- found love-must its sweet music be con- verted into dissonance by meddling hands of interest, calculation, ambition?- no sound of harmony permitted in this jarring life to soothe the mind to order and relieve it of distraction? Not one  not one.  And Nowell too! bound  to the  conditions, dragging the chain; a life-prisoner, poor fellow! And yet to Jessie, to Jessie Zellier! Has he senses, feelings, judgment? What man but he could look on such a creature with indifference? A being so formed to love and be loved! And to live with her! the enhancer of' one's joys, the soother of his sorrows, with whom  one would find his very virtues grow  and brighten. Oh, it were heaven on earth! And Now! NOWELL! NOWELL! That the blow should be struck by your hand! I love him, I do. Yet with her! living with    <pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6684-00000079"/> 156     WILL IT COME? her who should be mine, pressed to the bosom which should beat for me alone; fed upon the lip which I would die to touch. Oh, 'tis too much! I shall go mad. I shall hate him; I cannot bear it; I cannot see him making ruins out of paradise. I will avoid them. It will blast my eyes to look upon them again. And yet, he is not happy! No; and he loves her not, he does not, the insensate. And she loves not him. I know she does not; she loves not him, no, no, no! So much the worse.  This precious flower, whose odor I could scent for ever, to be a weed in his hands, its beauty and its fragrance no more worth than if it were the poorest thing in God's creation! AfWht wonder, is this-what a mystery of mysteries that what were life, health, heaven to me, should be death and burial to him! O my God! what have we done to be made thus wretched?   CHAPTER   X. N  OWELL was dining with me at my hotel. We were alone together. "Searcher," said Ellery, "why do you look on me so fixedly with those melancholy eyes of yours?" "Indeed, I know not. I knew not that I did. 'Tis an odd thing though, Nowell, that you and I never get together without becom- ing grave as owls, and about as talkative." "You flatter." "More than you are aware of. I am just of that mood, Nowell, which takes its color from surrounding objects. Gay with the cheerful, pensive with the sad. Yet when I'm merry I'm not contented, strange as it may seem, while when I'm serious I respect myself." "Then you mean to say that when brought    <pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6684-00000080"/> 158  *   VILL IT COME? in contact with my earth you take a tint of philosophic brown?" "Indecc, I do. If you will believe me, I am never in your society, Nowell, but that I feel elevated in my own respect: I am a better, a wiser, but withal a sadder man." "Oh, no, no, Searcher, never say 'tis I that make you grave: you are duller than all the melancholics of Sir John - cats, bag- pipes, and all, and have been ever since I knew you." "True." "Why, you would have brought the coli- seum down, if looking sour on it would have done it. I never saw in Rome any thing half so serious except the paving stones. Faith, I believe I brought upon you the light of my countenance out of sheer com- passion when we were at Harvard, lest you should mildew in your own shadow. But now - oh, you make me think of mandrake and nightshade." "Oh my friend, how charmingly you dis-   WILL IT COME?     159 course! Why, if you were only talking Latin, one would swear you were praying." "Which would be vastly to your edifica- tion. But I believe you are right, Searcher, though the muscles of my face are as God made them, and your manners just now - are, I suppose, too, as God made them." You will have to let them pass; for to save my life I cannot mend them. I am very dull, -dull enough, heaven knows,- and yet, yoz!" Nowell said nothing, but appeared busy with his almond shells; while I watched him, admiring the dignity which he threw even into trifles. You would have known him for a gentleman merely by the way in which he played with his plate. For some minutes we sat thus silent, and it had been difficult for an observer' to pro- nounce which of us was the more serious. At length Ellery raised his eyes, while a slight elevation of his chest made me think he would have sighed, though he permitted,    <pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6684-00000081"/> 160     WILL IT C01IME? the emotion no audible escape, and fixing them upon my own for a few minutes, said ill his slow, impressive manner,- "Searcher, do you know that you resemble your sister very much, particularly now that you smile? The likeness would be striking, despite your high features, had you not every now and then such a savage way of looking with the eyes. Excuse. me, but I've seen them flashing from their caverns as though your spirit were brooding over some remembered wrong, and were about to find vent in angry exclamation. Again, how sad and tearful they look. Indeed, my dear Leland (to my surprise he took my hand and spoke with much emotion), I have never presumed to speak upon the subject before, and I am not apt to interfere in other men's affairs; but you have honored me with your confidence so fully, so unreservedly, and have made me so intimate with :all your feel- ings, that you must excuse me if I venture to give what may seem like advice. You   WILL IT COME?      G161 give your thoughts, then, too much to those dark opinions which you entertain. Why ponder so incessantly such gloomy themes?" I had feared he was about to come nearer to the true cause of my dejection; but when I found he was so wide from it, I felt almost disappointed, and drew my hand away. He mistook me again. "You are offended. Oh, no, you smile how like to-to Miss Searcher! Yet it is a melancholy smile too. My dear Searcher, I am naturally a grave man, perhaps a gloomy one; but you are of a temperament, I think, more lively; you have just now said so; are you not wrong, then, in the very heyday of youth, to draw so thick a curtain, as it were, between the sunlight and your spirit and shut it up in rayless gloom? You look on me with surprise. I am talking, I know, quite out of my character, and- I confess I have not felt so much excited for many a day; but you interest me" (through my sister, I thought), "and I would try what F    <pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6684-00000082"/> 162     WILL I COME? little iufluence I have over you. Come, let alone your poetry and metaphysics and theology: why be eternally dreaming or brooding over the other world, -let us live in this." "But, Nowell, I assure you you are totally out: my metaphysics and poetry bother me but very little just now." "Yet that little is enough to distract you. Heavens! were I to revolve such themes as you have clone; and so intensely, I should go stark mad. Let me see: what were those lines you permitted me to read a twelve- month gone? I never thought of you after without recalling them and shuddering." And Nowell rehearsed some stanzas I had written some years previous, on "The Mys- teries," into which I had poured all the fervor, melancholy, and darkness of the faith in which I was cradled, and which took its coloring from Dante's "Infernus," and the most sombre shades of Pollok's "Course of Time," and Young's "Night Thoughts."   WILL IT COME?     163 The deep and mellow music of Nowell's fine voice, and the solemn grandeur of his slow enunciation, gave to these verses (not of sufficient importance to introduce here) a sublimity that by no means belonged to them; and I could not help listening with deep pleasure, for it was the very quint- essence of flattery my friend was administer- ing, and, like every thing he did in courtesy, it was measured with a skilful hand. "Now," he said, after a moment's pause, "is not this enough to drive one mad? I mean the brooding eternally over such dark themes, and dwelling with doubt, and in- dulging uncertainties and gloom, almost to the blackness of despair; living as though you had 'one foot in the grave, and the other all but-er,' as some of the exhorters say" .  "You have a strange way to wake one into gayety, I must confess, my friend. It only makes me the more sad, that you seem struggling, in rallying me, to drown an un- C-   LII     <pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6684-00000083"/> 164     WILL IT COME? easiness you will hardly own to yourself, but which friendship cannot help seeing, not only in the deep shadows of your melan- choly eyes, but the perpetual sadness that sits upon your brow." Nowell began to play again with his nut- shells. Suddenly he remarked, without raising his eyes, "Searcher, you should have married Lessie instead of me,-you would have suited her exactly, -and I " even now I scarcely know whether he was speaking to me, and not rather to himself. It was well, however, he did not look up. "But," he added, interrupting himself, "every thing in this life goes by contraries. But we're not going to be sad." "No, I should think not, by that smile, Nowell. It was scarcely human." "Ah! yes, I shall melt directly, doubt- less, but you look more like a host now, and my veritable friend in the flesh, and less like an angel bewailing the lost pleiad." "It is because I like your gayety so well.   WILL IT COME?      165 I would rather see you smile when you are merry than-" , -           -- He interrupted me: "Oh, I shall pour no m6re oil on you. It is mere waste when you fling it back to me. But/Searcher, upon my soul, -for which I have/a great regard in despite of you, - I cannot' see what right a man of your breadth of shoulders, vigor of limb, and energy of brain, has to be overcome by any thing, - except the sexton." "What then do you say for yourself, oh philosopher of an hour, whose coat fits me like my own, whose advantages are in every way superior - home, wife " "Wife!"  oh, so mournfully repeated, and then a pause, in which I could hear both our hearts beating distinctly, and mine seemed surging almost to suffocation. "Heigh-ho! I must be off, Searcher: H" shall take you home with me." "I thiki not. Not to-night." "Come,. come, don't be surly: you shall take a cup of tea with Mrs. Nowell."    <pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6684-00000084"/> 166     V1ILL IT COME? "Many, many thanks, my friend, but you must excuse me this evening." "'Why, what the deuce, man! you'll not go home witl me. to my wife, when I myself -urge you! I wish you only had one, you would find me more civil." You are like other preachers, Nowell: your practice don't square with your preach- ing, I'm quite sure." "True, true, -you do me no more than justice. But, my most incorrigible, at what hour am I to have the pleasure of driving you out to-morrow?" "At two -if you are really determined to play the -" "The deuce, you would say - never say the devil -he is not popular in these times; certainly--needs must -to-morrow at two.

THAT   is, Leland Searcher, left the hotel where I had lodged, and took pos- session of my mother's house-vacated by her joining the company of which she had long been a member in spirit, the angels. I had every room refitted, and the whole house modernized, excepting the room in which I was born, and which for so many years of my life had been my sanctum. I made large additions of books, the best works of mod- ernl and ancient writers, to my library, and, in fine, spared no pains and no money to render the sacred old homestead as cosy and as comfortable as possible. My sister was, since our mother's return to her native home over the "flowery bridge,-" visiting a very near and dear relative, who would not hear of her leaving them; and so I did not press 8    <pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6684-00000086"/> 170     W['ILL IT COME? the matter, as it was doubtless more proper that the orphan maid should be with them than under my sole charge. So, all alone, I took possession of the house, where since infancy I had passed some portion of each year, happy, ah 4 how happy! I had grati- fied my taste; I had surrounded myself with elegance somewhat; I was near to luxury, in one sense of the word, if not two. Alas! there was wanting yet one thing to make me quite a settled man; and that was never, never to be mine. The drawing-room was bare of its chief charm; the lonely bed looked cold and desolate; no smile was there to greet me when I entered or left; no chil-i dren's prattle welcomed me in the door or on the lawn; the lazy but hearty Newfound- land, my only confidante, rose at my ap- proach, from the rug, stretched his sleek limbs, and gaped. I envied the lazy fellow for looking so contented. Poor Leo i - yet he was contented because I loved him and was by. Ah well!   WILL IT COME     171 The second week had passed since my domestication. My sister had been with me every morning, more or less; Nowell had called often, and as often urged me in his dignified and tender way to return his visits, which I steadily declined, to his very great annoyance I believed, though he was ever too much the gentleman to show any sign thereof. He had just left. It was a beauti- ful morning, and I was preparing to go out, when the knocker was sounded, and my old friend Kingman was folded to my heart. "Oh, come in good time, my dear Sir John," I said, most warmly; "I am so glad to see you,-you will do me a world of good; but I will not be too selfish-here, let me present my sister - my Lessie." When my gentle sister had left us, I hastened to unbosom my whole soul to my friend, who listened with a sympathy and an appreciation I could scarcely have looked for in a brother. Yes," said he, "you have done right, my    <pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6684-00000087"/> 172     WTILL IT CO E M? noble fellow. Of course you could not help loving the beauty, -the angel as you think, and as from your most vivid description I am inclined to believe, - nor could you help showilng it, as you did on meeting her under such circumstances. Nor can you at once dismiss her spirit from the shrine at which you peeped into heaven through her eyes, nor her imnage from the retina of your own melancholy eyes, or very soon get rid of the spell she and heaven, for some grand purpose let us believe, or at least hope, have woven around your magnanimous and too sensitive heart. But you can, and of course you will, as you have already done, keep fromi the double crime - excuse me, my dear Leland - the mention of that last word in connec- tion with your name nearly blistered my lips; excuse me, I plead again, for I know that you are the special care of heaven, as you are of this all too dull heart, too dull to express half the confidence it cherishes for one so noble and good."   W TILL IT C0IE?    173 "Many thanks, my dear Kingmlan; but let us turn the subject for the present. I am strong in your presence, and will be in your noble friendship when you are gone. "And now, please, if you are in the mood, let me hear the rest of your story. By-the- bye, this Letitia is a marvel. I have scarcely seen her since our trip to the mountains; but at the time she impressed me for life, and the whole country is ringing with her fame. She impresses and thrills everybody that she meets personally, male or female, and publicly her admirers hang on her lips as on the breath of an angel." "Yes, I am conversant with her every- day history; and she is making more than 'her mark;' she is being, while most of the young ladies of whom we are hearing so much said, are but seeming personalities. She has long had an ambition to know every thing, and to be all there is to be; that ambition for the universal, not uncom- mon perhaps in versatile and lively imangina-  <pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6684-00000088"/> 174     WILL IT COME? tions, which easily master whatever they attempt, and which find, therefore, every efbort only a triumph to'their self-esteem. As her teacher and friend (and I shall come to the story of our life's young mnorn- ing presently), I have ailways held it as a doctrine, that the mind should not be utter- ly ignorant of any species of human knowl- edge or accomplishment within its reach, and that the body being a part of us, and that part most prominent and visible, had also a legitimate right to its careful education, for we are not all soul. The body should .of course be the servant of the mind; but neg- lect the servant too much and he will rebel, 1and perhaps leave your service altogether, if he does not in turn become your tyrant. No person can become great or be eminently (good, or, I will go further still, be of sound mind, with this temple of the living soul rent and dilapidated with disease, or weak land tottering for the want of proper and lncessary care. I think the Latins were right: "Jiens sana ini copore sano."   WILL IT COME 9     175 This notion of the unity of education in the mental and corporeal is not original with me, as you are aware, of course. It is as old as Athens, at least. Alcibiades and Pe- ricles, the incarnations of the genius of their country, were splendid illustrations of this all-accomplishment, that is, of its twofold nature. They were wanting in the "one thing" which Miss Percival has added, and which makes her complete; namely, the fruiting of character into spiritual power. They were simply body and mind: she is body, mind, and soul. They had immense advantages in the men- tal, as also in the corporeal education or culture. The life which they, in common with many others of the ancients, led, their habits and customs, so entirely dissimilar from the indolent apathy of modern times, were well suited to perfect all the faculties of the mind, and to gift with all the graces of the body. The bath and the gymnasium, which made a necessary part of their exist- <pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6684-00000089"/> 176      VILL IT CO0ME? ence, served without special effort to har- monize, to strengthen, and to embellish. Their very habit of existence brought them b3auty, by giving them liealth. Again, absolute liberty for the people pro- duced almost a universal genius. The stir and ferment and astonishing activity of those old republics forced intellect, as well as the body, almost beyond nature herself. Such a soil with such an atmosphere could but foster divine seeds, and the creatures they generated, in special, were, among the gen- eral populace, thought to be "gods." These causes combined gave the ancients that character of the "all-accomplished" which moderns seldom even hope to attain- but which in reality some very far surpass, inasmuch as the culture of the spiritual nature has received more attention than ever before, and is ripeniln into fruits that are almost infinitely superior to the 'golden apples which lured the classics. The division of labor in our country and   W VILL IT' C0 ME?    1" in our time, has become necessary to a vast and complex order of civilization, and not confined to petty cities and petty govern- ments, but spread over large and well-popu- lated States, each a rich and splendid republic in itself, we Americans have not only area sufficient, but every incentive to ambition, and the temptation to try our hand, especial- ly in youth, at almost every thing within the range of mortal grasp. Insensibly, through a wide and desultory range, we finally gather together the vast hoard of thoughts and images, of practical illustrations of life, of comparisons of the multiform as- pects of truth, 'whether in men or books, which are the aids and corroborants and embellishments of the' single and sole pur- suit to which we finally attach ourselves. And if one maln, or, more properly in these times, if one person, cannot hope successfully to unite the poet, the soldier, the philoso- pher, the artist, the critic, the oracle of one sex and the idol of the other, as Prior   <pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6684-00000090"/> 178     WILL IT COME? says elegantly to Lord Bolinghroke, "Men respect you and women love you,  we are inl no danger of becoming the machines of the closet, or the creatures of one idea. It was a universal smattering which made Shakspeare profound, Goethe the greatest literary artiste that ever lived, and Milton the first poet of the world. It is the same thing that makes our own Emerson the voice of nature. We all flatter ourselves, doubtless, in our favorite tendencies, and for my own part I may deceive myself as to the nature of mine; but I consider that a passion to know every thing that is to be known, and to love the beautiful in all things, inot only elevates the thoughts and harmonizes the nind, and is aI sort of homage we owe to the gifts of God and the labors of man, but is the priest of the Beneficent and the shrine of Religion. Finding this ardent desire to know, and this love of beauty in all its aspects, intense and fervent in the beautiful organization   Hii       WILL IT COME?     179 whose young years were so blended with my own, I attempted, as I told you at our last hiterview, at the mountains, to cultivate her every faculty, so that she should acquire an almost intuitive jinstinct into the fluent har- mony of things. I endeavored to open to her every legitimate source of enjoyment, as well as every fount of knowledge, withiln my means. I not only taught and entertained her fronm books and in conversation, but wherever there was excellence, I tried to wake in her all the rapture of admiration. The landscape, a picture, a statue, a gem, a fine horse, a beautiful residence, the posses- sions of others, if worthy to be admired, I taulght her to inherit -in the gooad Book we are taught that the meek inherit the earth-lby appreciation and the consequent sense of enjoyment. As the weather grew too foul for our accustomed rambles, I persuaded her to let me see her at her home; and whether her mother was out or in, asleep or awake, it I   <pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6684-00000091"/> 180     WILL IT COME P made no difference to us, though we some- times sat for hours together with no other li ght than what the street lamp afforded through the uncurtained window. At these times I taught her--in addition to the rudiments which she had acquired at the common schools, as reading, writing, spell- ing, arithmetic, geography, grammar, etc. -the higher branches of the English, as natural history, geometry, astronomy, min- eralogy, botany, and physiology, with every law or rule of hygiene at my command. I added to the theory always and the rule an explanation or an illustration of each study, so as to make every lesson understood in its practicaDle application to the life not only for uses, but also for enjoyment. For every book we read,- and among- them I remember we went through all of Scott's, Fielding's, Bulwer's, James', Eugene Sue's, Victor iHugo's, and many other nov- els; histories, including the most impor- tant of ancient and modern; biographies of   WILL IT COME?    181 the most eminent men (the one book of this category that interested her most was Plutarch's Lives); poetry -Shakspeare, Milton, Byron, Shelley, Wordsworth, Gray, Beattie, Young, Pollok, Schiller, Whittier, Bryant, Longfellow, and much of the float- ing literature of both poetry and prose found in the papers and magazines of the day,- for each book we had a page in our index rerumr, and I not only criticised every idea expressed that was worth a comment, but I insisted upon her doing the same, in her own way, in her own words. What would otherwise have seemed like work was always pastime to us; for during the studies, or after we had closed them for the time, on what darling themes we dis- coursed - and often would we pass whole evenings thus, sometimes even into mid- night, wrapped in this communion of both heart and soul, Letitia's little hand in mine, her head inclined upon my shoulder, the fragrant hair floating in wavy curls upon my    <pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6684-00000092"/> 182      ILL IT COME? cheek and neck; while occasionally, in the interva ls of silence, a sigh would break from the flll soul of my fair companion, that made miy excited nerves quiver with ecstasy. It was a perilous, most perilous music, I knew, and I most always made it the key to the low, almost whispered farewell for the night. I pass over many, many evenings, weeks, months, of this intercourse, this delirious, wild music of life's young mornin g-the only notes of harmony and of beauty I have experienced in all the discordance of this luysterious life of ours; till one evening I was seated with Letitia precisely in the manner I have just described. We had ceased to speak for many, many minutes. WAhere her thoughts were fixed, or whither wandering, I knew not; but I remarked that she was fonder even than her wont. Her sighs-were more frequent, more prolonged; and her beautiful, rounded, ripe body, as it leaned deliciously upon my arm   WILL IT COME      183 and breast, thrilled and trembled to the very ends of the small fingers. Suddenly she sighed heavily, and a single tear fell hot upon my hand. My heart bounded. "Are you not well, Letitia?"I whispered. The tremulous, yet sweetly earnest and -affectionate tone of my voice betrayed but too much feeling. "Not well? .  . O Frank!" murmured the beautiful girl; when, as if prompted by some uncontrollable emotion, she raised my hand impetuously, and pressed it with ardor to her glowing lips. My blood took fire; my brain reeled; I drew my arm still closer round the petite waist, and strained the impassioned creature to my breast. Our hearts beat together, wildly and loud; yet Letitia drew not back. She put her own arm round my neck; she raised her face to mine, and murmured, "Dear, dear Frank!" and our lips met- were pressed, glued, convulsively, delicious- ly togetherfor the first time!    <pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6684-00000093"/> 184     WrILL IT CO1ME  A light flashed down upon my eyes. Its rays issued from the bedroom of my mother. It lingered a moment; presently the shutter was closed, and we were in the cark again. But we were saved! "Good-night, Letitia, good-night!" "My God! - what? Frank, will you leave me?- so soon?- so abruptly?- Will you leave me, Frank?" "Will I leave you? Would I shut the gates of gehenna were they opening to inclose you? Good-night, Letitia, good- night for ever." "Frank! sir - Mr. Kingman!- he is gone!- No!-dear Frank, say, is it I that. have offended you? Have I been too free? Oh, have I been guilty?" "Loose me, Letitia, loose me, I say-I beg of you! Nay, it is for your sake, dear girl. Yet, once again, good-night. One kiss. Thus . . . "You will not leave me, then, so soon? One hour more - one little hour, Frank?"   WILL IT COME?     185 "Oh, no, no, no! -don't you see?--- Your heart beats so loud you can hear it across the room. Oh, no, I must go now - we must meet here no more, and at this hour. O Letitia, thou art too dear to me! By these eyes whose lids I kiss - by these soft cheeks -these lips of roses "-my moth- er's light broke through the crevice/- "O my God! Leti - Leti -good-night, for ever!" I darted from the room; I rushed from the house, without thinking -f the noise I made, and gained the street - my door. The next day, after passing a sleepless night-a night of conflict and  agony, I wrote Letitia something like the following: We have narrowly escaped, my dear, dearest one. We must not meet again soon. We shall be the fools of our imagination if we do. It would cost thee too dear. I love thee too well to purchase short-lived satisfaction at such expense. Do not reproach me: I am already wild with thinking and feeling. God knows I never meant you wrong, and I believe I have done you none.

I have taught you what it were better you had been left ignorant of, the secrets of your own nature, may the real good I flatter myself I have done you, by drawing out the hidden powers of your mind, and setting them upon their course, be put in balance against the unmeditated evil. As heaven knows how I love you, may heaven bless you, Letitia, my own love, my life! I in- close a ring. Wear it both as a slight'token of my affection, and as a remembrance of a dan- ger happily escaped-and, may I not add, as a pledge of security for the future  Like this jewel is thine honor, my own pre- cious-spotless and brilliant. Hot breath dulled its lustre for a moment, but has left it without a flaw. No similar encounter must ever again subject it to even a momentary dimness! And now--how can I say the hateful word?- farewell! If you feel but a pan a at this parting, let your imagination swell it to a pitch next key to madness, and you may conceive what I suffer in the conflict between duty and passion. But oh, Letitia, think! think how happy we have been! What a heaven we have enjoyed! Think how sublime a life we had nearly lost! Think how we may by a little self-denial "still hold the paradise not yet lost, thank heaven!" And let this thought inspire the prayer "Leave us not in temptation, but deliver us from evil ;"   WILL IT COME?      187 and make our brief separation only a bright an- ticipation of the fadeless joys of all who deny themselves and take up their cross. I will return in a few months, and then - the palm of victory, the crown of triumph, and thy sweet smile and voice of heaven! Farewell! Only two hours had passed since sending this missive, when the reply came to my trembling hand. Here it is:' Frank! Frank! -my own, my love, my life - take me away with you, or I shall die. You shall not part from me. Oh, make me any thing you please, so that I be not from you! Talk not to me of danger-my only danger is thine ab- sence. Nothing is, nothing can be, so dreadful to me as the void where thou art not, where Frank will not come! Oh, take me away with you, or stay with me, false, cruel one! Your own firmness only makes mine the weaker; your sense of duty and honor assures me that I am not in danger. I am writing wildly, I fear - but time presses -and I write in agony that were enough dis- tracting without this hurry. But why, why do you go from me? Why should you fear, or what?

If your saying, 'Make me any thing," means aught but marriage, I refuse to see it for an instant. You were stark mad when you wrote it, and saw noth- ing clear before you, -not even the rock you might dash against, and whose perils you cannot know. Dear, dear, wild, blessed being! my own sweet, holy love, I must go from you; and I must go alone! Your very letter is an argument for our separation. A passion so ardent, so intense, a fire that is drying up the very bloom and beauty of our reason and would reduce soul and body both to ashes, is not to be trusted one moment. I write with apparent coolness, but I burn in a gehenna of feeling whose torments, could yout witness them, would move you to forget even your own, and bid me God-speed in endeavoring to do his will, that we may both finally grow into his likeness.

I'll draw the veil 'twixt thee and me, As earth at times shuts heaven from view, To make the smile of Deity More glorious still when it comes through; Or that its pulsing heart may rest Awhile from its resplendent guest! I am not tired of thee, - oh, never! No more than I am tired of God; No sunlight ever kissed the river, No flow'ret ever blessed the sod, No star e'er shone, nor murmured sea More tireless, than my love for thee! But stars will hide, and seas will rest, And sunbeams cease to kiss the skies, And flowers sometimes will do their best To shade their blushes from our eyes; And wouldst thou know the reason why,. Look in thy mirror, or on high!

The thorn and cross stand bleak and bare, The mount is steep and wild and high; I see the angels beckoning there, And pointing to the storm-rocked sky, And breathless hear their plaintive song Low murmuring, "We have waited long!" Farewell, then, darling! On the way Thine eyes shall light me, and thy breath Shall be my baptism night and day While I am conquering unto death; And when the cross is heavy, thine Shall be the hand that pours the wine. And when the thorns my temples press, The nails are in my bleeding feet, How will thy sorrow's pathos bless The agony, and make it sweet! And death itself shall glorious be, And lose its power through thee, through thee!

The knocker sounded at the door. It was Nowell. Soon after, the knocker sounded again. It was my sister.

He arose; my sister also arose. King- man looked distressed; and what could I do but fling my arms around Nowell's neck and beg his forgiveness? "Then you relent," he said, and gave me a smile that almost paid me for the strangu- lation I had nearly suffered in making the rash promise. In refusing to go home with Ellery, I was doing as I ought, was I not? and yet did not the contrary way seem right also? A very few days afterwards I called upon Nowell. He was out.  My heart beatt ea- sier. I drew a free breath for a moment, but as fate would have it, I chanced to see Jessie turn from a window of the draw- ing-room, and temptation was besetting me. Alone, probably.  What harm? No command of myself?  I remembered my   WILL IT CO ME?     1 195 friend Kingman's example. I thought of Nowell. But how shall I violate friendship, or, or -nonsense! only a mere visit of ceremo- ny, and I have promised. Shall have to see her, sometime, alone. May as well be done at once. All this time the porter was standing with the door wide open, wondering, doubtless, what was next to come, or if I had heard correctly; but presently he repeated, "Mr. Nowell is not at home, sir." I beckoned to him. "Did you say your mistress is not at home?" "Oh, sir, Madam is at home," and putting out his hand at the same time, I had alighted and the Rubicon was passed before I had well made up my mind. Jessie was alone, turning over a book of drawings. efter the customary compli- ments had passed between us, on my part very awkwardly, Jessie said,- "I was looking over some sketches just received. They are of scenes, Mr. Search-    <pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6684-00000099"/> 196    WTILL IT CO1E? er, which must be very familiar to you, so often as you have visited them." I rose accordingly, and looked over the beauty, while her fair fingers turned the scarcely whiter leaves, or rested on the points of view she wished me to observe; though I lolnged to gaze enamoured on the long straight lashes which reposed in beauty on her pale cheek, or on the transparent whiteness of her snowy-veined brow, hplf- hidden beneath her fine clustering hair. "There, you must remember this scene. It appears to be a view tlaken from the bend in the road just before you come to the gate thrown across the narrow pass where first I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Searcher." Jessie blushed slightly. "Your favorite peak looks softer in this drawing than when the thunder-cloud hung over it the day you would have us all go out and look at its grandeur. Yet I like it not as well, not nearly as well. I need not ask your opinion: I know you always thought the mountain lost, except   I ILL IT CO1 E?     197 when seen in shadow or by moonlight. But dear me, Mr. Searcher, are you determined that I alone shall express an opinion? Have you nothing to say, sir, on these familiar scenes? (Why did she not talk for ever!) "' But little, madam." "Indeed!" 1^,   Jessie seemed to have detected, in the tone of my serious if not rude reply, the almost displeased surprise with which I lis- tened to the once timid and diffident girl, so 1i^i  changed, as was but reasonable and becom- ing, into the confident and well-bred yet still gentle and delicate woman. Whether from this or some other cause, she added, in a less-assured manner, - "I should have thought these drawings would interest Mr. Searcher, if it were only from recollection." "Too deeply. Was it not on the borders of this unrivalled lake I had first the pleas- ure of knowing Miss Zellier? Scenery, Miss i    <pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6684-00000100"/> 198     WILL IT COME?

'Tis but a short time since, a very short time; yet how many changes have taken place, and how important!" "But not more, perhaps, than one mlay always reasonably expect in a like interval." "True, very true. Yet I was little pre- pared, on my return from abroad, to hear that Miss Zellier was married." "And ,married to your most particular friend." Jessie smiled; but her cheek was burning. She added, "So far at least the surprise must have been agreeable." Sore trial to my candor! I managed to reply, however, "Doubtless Mr. Nowell, of all men, is most worthy of his present hap- piness." An embarrassing silence succeeded this evasive compliment, which probably sug- gested to Jessie -for I durst not look on her--an unpleasant reflection, as it cost a   WILL IT COME?      199 pang to me.  Women soonest extricate themselves from such entanglements in con- versation; and certainly Jessie had less cause than I to be confused. She turned the subject almost instantly. "You do not ask me of my mother, Mr. Searcher."  "Ah, yes! - pardon me -how is Madam Zellier? -and your most noble brother, please? Well, I trust?" "They were quite well when last we heard from them. They both always ask in their letters particularly about you, Mr. Searcher." "It was very polite of them to do so. Need I say how pleased I am to be thus remembered?  I hope you will return my compliments when you write, with my very best regards." "And shall I say how  much you are changed? Her inquiries were particular." "Not in' feelings, Mrs. Nowell.  You must do me the justice to present these just the same."    <pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6684-00000101"/> 200     WTILL IT CO ME? Oh, I am to know nothing about them, of course; I can judge only of externals; and these-" "No doubt I am much altered. I feel that I am." "That is implying quite too much, Mr. Searcher. I only perceive that you are thinner -a little thinner, perhaps." "And paler, and that is all." "And a little sadder." "Sadness comes with years, Mrs. Nowell." "And it would seem with months too. At least I suppose that is what you mean." That beautiful smile! How could she look so pleasant, when I was so very wretched? Yet there was something too of pity and of sympathy in the steady, open look of her melancholy eyes; and the gentle tones of her voice were not the echo of a mirthful heart. Those eyes, that voice, that *never-equalled smile, -they were unman- ning me completely, miserably. It was time to go - I mean, in ceremony.   WILL IT COME?     201 I laid my hand upon the drawings, and said. "Does my memory deceive me?-you have sketches of your own of many of these scenes?" "Some few, sir. Of course they will hardly bear examination after these finished drawings." "My memory, permit me to say, is more faithful than the artists. Shall I be excused if I demand a great favor in reward of its exactness?" "'Twill hardly deserve it, if it be as faith- ful on all points as on that 6f my sketch- book. However, you shall be excused, Mr. Searcher -unless your exaction be very un- reasonable." "There is one sketch among the number which I must beg of you. Will you give it to me?" "Oh, and welcome, if 'twill give you pleas- ure. I will send for the book if you will touch the bell." She gave her order accordingly. 9*    <pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6684-00000102"/> 202     WILL IT COME P "And what scene is it you refer to, Mr. Searcher?" There was a slight degree of timidity, I thought, mingled with curiosity, in this question. I am not sure that my own voice was untroubled as I answered,  "That which Miss Zellier took the day I had the happiness to escort her and Madam Zellier " "To climb the hills, when my mother was afraid to venture with us? Oh, I remember it well." The servant entered with the book. She turned over .the drawings. "This is 'it: is it not?" she said, il the same gay tone of voice in which she had very properly in- terrupted me when I was bechming perhaps too expressive in my manner. "You see, I have taken some pains to finish it; for it's quite a pretty view. You are welcome to it, if you admire it. Indeed, it partly belongs to you by right, Mr. Searcher; for it was at your suggestion that I took it, and through   WILL IT COME?  O   203' your hints that I succeeded to your satisfac- tion. And see," she added, vainly endeav- oring to be playful in her tone, while her pale cheek took the color of the damask rose, "here are the little flowers which you gathered where I sat. Forget-nme-nots. You see I have kept them well." "I see. They are dry and withered." Imprudent, -and audacious were it volun- tary,-but heaven knows I could not help it, -this allusion, to which my feelings must have given deep expression, in the low, solemn, yet treacherously distinct tone in which it was uttered, could be only too well understood. I rolled up the drawing, and scarcely find- ing breath to leave my compliments for Ellery, bowed, and, without waiting to raise my eyes to Jessie, slowly left the room.    <pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6684-00000103"/> L         CHAPTER XIII. WTTTE must now lay aside for a time the history we have so long been pursu- ing, and re-introduce characters who have already had, and who are yet to have, con- siderable attention in these pages. It was late in summer, on a lovely after- noon, just as the sun was getting ready to furl his pinions for his nightly rest, that Letitia Percival and Elzie Estelle Aidens pursued their way along a scene which might well be favored by their selection. No sooner had they crossed the bridge which spanned the beautiful river whose flowery and tree-fringed banks they had chosen for their ramble, than the village seemed van- ished into earth, so quiet, so lonely, so far from the evidence of life was the landscape thro ugh which they passed. On their righ-    <pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6684-00000104"/> 206     tVILL IT COJE? sloped a green and silent hill, shutting out all view beyond itself, save the deepening and twilight sky. To the left and immedi- ately along their road lay fragments of stone, covered with moss or shadowed by wild shrubs that here and there gathered into copses, or, breaking abruptly away from the rich sod, left frequent spaces through which you caught long vistas of forest land, or a brooklet gliding in music over its rocky course, and breaking into a thousand tiny waterfalls or mimic eddies. So secluded was the scene, and so unwitnessing of culti- vation, that you would not have believed that a human habitation could be at hand; and this air of perfect solitude and quiet gave an additional charm to the spot. "But I assure you," said Elzie, earnestly continuing a conversation they had begun, "I afssure you I was not mistaken; I saw him as plainly as I see you." "What, following us?- do you think he was really following us?"   WILL IT COME?     207 "Yes; for as I looked around he paused and seemed confused, and stepped back a little; there -there he is now! you can see for yourself." "Heaven forbid!" cried Letitia, turning hastily around in alarm; and lo! the very person in question, whom Elzie had minutely described, but a little distance behind them and walking on with stealthy step! Both uttered a faint shriek of alarm at the same time. The spot was so lonely, so out of the way, and the imagination of both had been so worked upon the previous evening by the recital of an outrage that had recently been perpetrated in the vicinity, that a thousand apprehensions crowded at once upon the minds of the fair wanderers. Without, however, giving vent in words to their alarm, they, as by an involuntary and simultaneous suggestion, quickened their pace, every moment stealing a glance behind to watch the progress of the suspected per- son. They thought that he also seemed to    <pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6684-00000105"/> 208     WILL IT COME  accelerate his movements, and this observa- tion increased their terror, and would appear, indeed, to give it some rational ground. At length, as, by a sudden turn in the road, they lost sight of the dreaded stranger, their alarm suggested to them but one resolution, and they fairly fled on as fast as the fear, which actuated would allow them.  The nearest house in that direction was King- man's, and both imagined if they could come in sight of that they would be safe. They looked back at every interval. Now they did not see their fancied pursuer; now he emerged again into view; now - yes, he also was running! "Faster, faster, Elzie, for God's sake! he is gaining upon us!" cried Letitia. The path grew more wild and the trees more thick and fiequent. At every cluster that marked their progress they saw the stranger, closer and closer. At length a sudden bend in the road, a sudden turn in the landscape, a broad plain burst upon   WILL IT COME   -   209 them, and in the midst of this stood Frank Kingman's ancestral home! "Thank heaven, we are safe!" cried Le- titia. She turned once more to look for the stranger. In so doing her foot struck against some obstacle, and she fell with great violence over the low wall that partly fenced the narrow path from the ravine it bordered. Over, down -oh, fearful sight to the terrified Elzie! -down, down! the rough, craggy stones and bushes giving way as she rolled, tumbled along to the very bot- tom of the glen! Poor Elzie, although in this fearful state of terror for Letitia, couldt not help looking back once more; but seeing the object of their flight at some distance still, and turned aside, indeed, and the next instant lost in the bushes, she sprang over the precipice to the side of Letitia like a squirrel, all the work of a moment. "O merciful God!. what-oh dear, oh dear! Are you alive, Tishey?"    <pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6684-00000106"/> 210     TWILL IT COME? Letitia was alive, and had endeavored to rise, but was unable to stir from the half- earthy and half-watery bed into which she had been precipitated. With great difficulty Elzie now assisted Letitia to a dryer spot only a pace or so distant, sobbing as she did so - Oh dear, dear! what shall we do? You are half-killed, I know you are! Oh, see this blood all over your face and hands!" And the poor, frightened creature shrieked aloud, O God!   Help, help!" The blood was indeed oozing -over and painting cheeks and lips that were blanched to a pallor that seemed like death. "Don't shriek and sob so, my precious Elzic," presently murmured Letitia, as soon as she could command her breath; "don't shriek so, you will raise the - " "That's what I want, Tishey. I want to raise somebody. I can't see you die here all alone." And she called agaLin, at the top of her affrighted lungs, "Help, help!"   WILL IT COME      2" So singularly still and solitary was the spot, that this cry of distress, breaking the silence, had in it something startling even to her who uttered it, and appeared to the returning consciolsness of Letitia as a key to unlock this retreat, where Providence had safely lodged them, to the profanation they had but just now so much dreaded. They did not wait long, however, in either sus- pense or dread. A step was heard; nearer, nearer still! The bushes were thrown back, and their pursuer stood before them! He was a man'who might perhaps have numbered some five-and-thirty years; but at a hasty glance he would have seemed consid- erably younger. He was above the ordinary stature; his frame was thin and slender, but well knit and fair proportioned. Nature had originally cast his form in an athletic mould, but sedentary habits and the wear of mind seemed somewhat to have impaired her gifts. His cheek was pale and delicate; yet it was the delicacy of thought rather than ill-health. ,    <pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6684-00000107"/> 212     WILL IT COME? His hair, which was long, and of a deep, rich brown, was worn back and up from his face and temples, and left a broad, high, ma- jestic forehead utterly unrelieved and bare, mand smooth as in younger men, excepting a few deep wrinkles running through the centre from temple to temple. There was a singular clearness and, so to speak, pro- fundity of thought, eloquent upon its clear expanse, which suggested the idea of one who had passed his life thus far, both in con- templation and emotion, both in and out of the battle of life, at the same time its soldier and its commander. It was a face that a physiognomist would have loved to look upon, so much did it speak both of the refinement and dignity of intellect, and the experience which gifts with power. He now stood before the two girls, silent for an instant, and pale with the agitation which such a scene could not fail to produce; and it would have been scarce an unworthy Jo   W ILL IT COJIE?    213 subject for a picture--that romantic glen, the deep shadows relieved here and there by i the slanting beams of the setting sun, the  clear sparkling, laughing cascade, Letitia's -::eclining and bleeding form, and downcast  and death-like expression, the eager face of Elzie about to narrate the nature of their mishap, and the pale, almost ghostly and stalwart form of Frank Kingman himself, thus suddenly converted from an imaginary robber into the protector of beauty and the saviour of distress.. In a moment the countenance of Frank testified the liveliest and most eager interest. Both ladies were inexpressibly touched at the tender manner in which he took the wounded girl into his strong arms and bore her to his home, the sympathy he expressed for her pain, the compassion of his eyes; and as those dark unfathomable orbs bent gently upon her own, Letitia, in spite of her pain, felt the same old indescribable thrill at her heart, which long months, long years ,    <pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6684-00000108"/> 214     WILL IT COLME? ago she had, -but we draw the veil over h4r heart lest we discover to mortal gaze the sear which she thinks hidden, or open only to the eye that is now tenderly bent upon hers.  The room in which the ladies now found themselves was the most spacious in the house, and it was at once made agreeable by the mother and sister of Kingman, who, in- stantly comprehending the accident Letitia had met with, busied themselves with a promptness which showed their sympathy for suffering, in preparing fomlentations, ban- dages, etc., while the surgeon was arriving. The anguish of the sprains and bruises was soon relieved, so that when the physician arrived, he pronounced the skill of the fair nurses equal at least to his own, and the sufferer by no means in a dangerous con- dition. The physician was soon through with his prescriptions and directions; and commis- sioned by Kingman to take the news of the   W ILL IT COM2E?    215 accident to the father of Elzie, of whose family Letitia had for some time been a member, as she was also no distant relative, his carriage was soon heard rattling from the yard. While Kingman was despatching the good doctor with this important mission, his mother and sister were busy in preparing tea and " setting to rights " the house, which had been put into some considerable confusion by this unlooked-for visitation. When the door had closed upon Lctitia and Elzie, leaving them the sole occupants of the elegant room, they cast glances of interest and curiosity around the apartment into whidh they had been so singularly and providentially introduced. It was indeed a place of interest to both of these fair beings- for reasons which the reader has doubtless already guessed. It was of dimensions which would be con- sidered out of proportion to the rest of the house, were it not so well filled with books.  .     <pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6684-00000109"/> 216     WILL IT COM1E  It was walled from the floor to the roof with books; volumes of all languages, al(d it might even be said, without much exagCgra,- tion, upon all sciences and nearly every spe- cies of literature, were strewn around on the chairs, the tables, and the floor. By the window stood the well-worn desk, and by it a large old-fashioned chair of oak. "There," thought Letitia, "was born and   came forth the thought, and there were kindled the emotions, which have made me what I am. O my God! my God! how I still love, idolize, worslip that man! Forgiye me, my dear Father in heaven, if for one  brief moment I linger in delirium, on the spell so long since broken; and bruised as I am in body, and seared and withered in what is called heart, I 'find one small green spot still left to feel and fieshen with the dews of thy inspiration. Forgive me if I yield a moment to the influence into which thy Providence hath cast me. Yes, here-in this room-here, not three years since-   TILL IT C0OME     217 here, pure, beautiful, glorious --e, a part of nature, nay, who should be, who yet will be, its tuft and applause--7le, the respected of men, the idol of women , here in this room, by that same desk, in that very chairi,-oh, would I could touch it with these burning lips,-he bowed his yet young, his great and noble soul unto me, he looked from  this very window  into mine,-he elevated me so very far above himself in his quick ideal, as he looked and longed and worshipped from behind these blinds,-he suffered here perhaps in this very bed, in despair of ever winning the thoughtless girl, turning sleepless in his agonly that I could not say yes, even before he asked me! And now, now! Not three years. Oh! hast thou sent me here, myste- rious Mover of all events, to mock at my agony? Oh, no, no, no!--forgive this yet weak heart, dear, dear Father I will -" The spell was broken; for Elzie, who had really begun to yawn, supposing Letitia was l0 '    <pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6684-00000110"/> 218     WILL' IT COME? lulled to a temporary slumber, but seeing her eyes filling with tears, hastened to inquire, "Are you in pain,ldarling?" "Oh, no, dear, I was only dreaming; don't mind me. I am quite easy. I am not so much hurt as I thought. I shall be able to ride home right away, -is it most time for the carriage?" "Not quite time yet, poor sufferer. I fear we shall have a long evening before my father arrives. Just consider, the fat old nag, never too- fast, can only creep along that broken path, -for road there is none; it will be late midnight before he arrives. I wonder where Mr. Kingman is all this time. It is unkind of him to -" "Oh, say not so, Elzie. He cannot be un- kind to any one, much less to one he loves so well as - " "As his naughty Elzie, you would say," cried the impetuous girl, throwing her arms around the sufferer's neck; but it is not for myself I spoke, dear Letitia: I do so want   WILL IT CO1ME     21 him to come to you -for, notwithstanding your words, I cannot help feeling that you are suffering deeply; indeed, the tears that you cannot repress are telling me so, and if he were here- " "He is here, and the carriage is nearly at the gate, sweet pet," said the gentleman in question; and the next moment she was folded in his arms. The bruised and suffering Tishey had been with due' care and with the utmost tender- ness lifted into the carriage, and pillowed on the broad breast of her proud uncle; and as Kingman assisted the beautiful Elzie to her seat by their side, he was about stepping back to let the carriage pass on with its precious freight, when the hand of the hitherto relentless Aidens was extended with a seeming cordiality: "We have been as strangers, Mr. Kingman," said he, almost warmly; "it is not often that I change my opinion, or relent in my judgment; but our good doctor informs me that I am indebted    <pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6684-00000111"/> 2,40    WILL IT COME? to your care and timely skill for the life of this sweet girl. So Heaven melts the ice that man could' not have broken.  Come over and see your patient to-morrow." The excuse died upon Kingman's lips, for the irresistible eyes of Elzie plead while her father spoke, and her sobs, as he finished his sentence, became so audible that her father was heard hushing her above the noise of the carriage as it rolled away from the door. With an abstracted air, and arms folded across his 1breast, Frank Kingman gazed after the carriage till the winding of the valley snatched it from his view. He then, as though waking from a dream, turned into the house, and mounted with slow steps to the room just vacated by the fair beings whose fates seemed so indissolubly blended with his own. It was deep midnight.   The heavens broadened round him in all the loving yet august tranquillity of the season and the hour; the stars bathed the living atmosphere /   WILL IT CO IE?    221 with a solemn light; and above, about, around, the time seemed  holy-almost breathless with adoration. After carefully and  tenderly looking around the twice-lonely room, noting every object which had been touched even to holi- ness by her feet, and hers no less, -the bed in which Letitia had lain, the white sheets which had touched her throbbing and suffer- ing body, holding his eyes the longest of any; he looked forth upon the little modest dwelling opposite, in which she had won his heart, his very soul, only three years agone. Only three years," he sighed; "well!" and again a gr6at deep sigh swelled his bosom and seemed to float up, up, into the great ineffable stillness of the night, like a de- parting wing of prayer full-freighted for heaven. "Oh thou most magnificent of the nightly train," said he, soliloquizing, and ye mystic lights of heaven, all, worlds upon worlds, infinite, incalculable, bright defiers of rest    <pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6684-00000112"/> 222     WILL IT COIME? and change, rolling for ever above our petty sea of mortality, as, wave after wave, we fret forth our little life and pass on, on, into the beyond: cal we look upon you and note your appointed order and your unvary- ing course, and not feel that we are indeed in the currents of a resistless, all-pervading, and wisely determinate destiny? Shall we see throughout creation each marvel fulfill- ing its pre-ordered fate, no wandering from its orbit, no variation in its seasons, and yet imagine that the infinite Ordainer will neg- lect the tides of his own being, or stay or turn them as human will may determine or human heart may desire? Shall we think that our throbbing hearts or soul-winged prayers can or should vary one thread woven with the skein of events? To change a particle of our fate mirght change the destiny of millions! Shall the link for- sake the chain and yet the chain be un- broken? Away, then, oh vague repinings, blind de-   WILL IT COME?     223 mands, restless yearnings!

The colors of our existence were all determined before our birth, our trials and our triumphs; millions of ages back, when this hoary earth was peopled by other kinds, yea! ere its atoms had formed one layer of its present soil, the eternal and all-seeing Ruler had fixed the moment of our birth and the limits of our career. What, then, is the trial through which I am  passing? what the sufferings already endured? what, indeed, life itself but a sublime moment,  one of the duo- decillions on the wing for ever and ever!

THE next day, faithful to his appoint- Inment, Kingman arrived at Aidens'. The proud man received him with dignified but most respectful attention, and Elzie and Tishey with smiles that said more than words could. Tishey was a prisoner to the sofa, and very sore and weak, of course, from the severe fall she had met with; but in coin- pliment to the guest, she desired to be in the parlor with the rest of the family. Naturally enough, the conversation turned upon the accident that had happened to the fair and loved Letitia; and naturally enough, when that was thoroughly discussed, it drift- ed to the scenery of the country round; and in both, Kingman shone with a peculiar grace. Vividly alive to human suffering of    <pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6684-00000115"/> 228   W  ILL IT COlIE  every kind, and extremely tender in his nature to every living thing, his portrayal of the fright of the young ladies, the suf- ferings of Letitia in reality, and of Elzie in sympathy; the pitiable plight in which he found them,- always blaming himself as the cause of the whole catastrophe, and spoken in such dignified and yet musical tones, won largely upon the stern and yet not ungener- ous heart of James Otis Aidens. But in the conversation whvich followed, he seemed so simple and easy, and so utterly at home, that "the good man of the house" had nearly given' upl every prejudice he held against him. Minutely acquainted with every variety of nature, he invested every hill and glade to which remaurk recturred with the poetry of his descriptions; and from his research he gave even scenes the most familiar a charm and interest which had been strange to this man of the world till then. To this stream some romantic legend had attached itself, long forgotten, but now   WILL IT COME?     229 revived; that moor, so barren to an ordinary eye, was yet productive of some rare and curious herb whose properties afforded scope for lively description; that old mound was yet rife in attraction to one versed in antiquities and able to explain its origin, and from such explanation deduce a thousand classic episodes. No subject was so homely or so trite but the knowledge that had neglected nothing was able to render it luminous and new. And, as he spoke, his countenance bright- ened, and his voice, at first hesitating and low, compelled attention to its earnest and winning music. Aidens himself, a man who in his long retirement had n'ot forgotten the attractions of intellectual society, nor even neglected a certain cultivation of intellectual pursuits, enjoyedna pleasure that he had not experienced for years. The gay Elzie Estelle was fascinated beyond herself; and her fascination was more than equalled by her joy in the as- i  O            <pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6684-00000116"/> 230     WILL IT COME? surance she felt, that victory was gained at last. Poor Letitia, the only silent one of the group, drank in every word, conscious, and yet unconscious, of the sweet poison she was drinking; the same she had drank so long, and yet was not wholly able to pray, "Let this cup pass from me: nevertheless, not my will, but thine, O God, be done."   CHAPTER   XV. TF there be ally thing thoroughly heavenly in human life, it is affection. All that makes an aim elevated, ambition generous, hope beautiful, faith inspiring, belongs to the capacity of loving. For my own part, I, Leland Searcher, do not wonder in look- ing over the ten hundred and four creeds and sects of men on the earth, that those religionists and moralists who have wrought their systems from love, have by very far indeed succeeded best in holding empire over the human heart. What a beautiful fabric would be human nature, what a divine guide would be human reason, if love were indeed the stratum of the one and the in- spiration of the other! But in thus speaking of this ruling ele-    <pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6684-00000117"/> 232     WILL IT COME? mnent, this creative energy of all life, let me not be misunderstood.  There are so many counterfeits of this divine currency, there is so much base metal that passes for the real gold, andi again, the original spark, when once discovered, is so often obscured and sometimes entirely hidden by daily frivolities and petty emotions, especially in lives passed in cities, that we are more fre- quently pained than pleased or elevated by its expression in the life. By love, I mean that baptism that comes down out of heaven like the silent, imperceptible dewfall, upon the young heart, and transforms the hitherto young animal - boy or girl - into a living soul. At first it is a nondescript, an indefinable something that plays in gossamer beauty around, but hardly touching the imagination, a golden haze, like that which suffuses the Indian summer time, fills, indistinctly, dreamily, the whole sensitive being; till at length it gets organized into a thought, and   WILL IT COME?      233 thence into the blood. In this vital current at last it becomes an emotion, which rules to higher aims and nobler ends; aims and ends out of and beyond the centre and sphlere of self alone, and sighs for the com- pletion of the Creator's purpose in the loss of a rib to gain the paradise of perfect asso- ciation and perfect rest. The love of which I speak is akin to, but more, how much more, than that repre- sented by Aristides in his famous picture in which an infant is sucking a mother who is wounded to the death, who even in that agony strives to prevent the child from in- juring itself by imbibing the blood mingled with the milk. Certainly, love is more than a negative. It not only strives to prevent injury to its object, it yearns to bless, to entertain, to elevate. And so thinks my friend, John Franklin Kingmlan, as the reader has doubt- less seen ere this, and as he will further learn in reading the close of his narrative of    <pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6684-00000118"/> 234     WILL IT CO3IE? his early love, which I now commence re- porting as he tells it to me-- Let me reflect a moment my dear Leland: I was interrupted at our last interview just as I had fled from home and Letitia: well, a twelvemonth, perhaps a little longer, passed in exile. I was home again. I pass over the interval of absence, you see, for it was only one long, long yearning to see, to bless, to enjoy the triumph which I was sure she would achieve, and feel the blessing return upon my own weary heart as a spell and a reward of heaven. Of course I was burning to see my fair angel at once; but as usual, my caution and curiosity took the lead of love, and so I took to my old observatory behind the blind of my window. Good heaven! how pale she was! how thin! how sorrowful! Could it be on my account? Yet she looked not up at my win- dow, though she must have known of my   WILL IT COME?     235 arrival home! She sought not to attract my attention! "She -has ceased to love me," I thought. And so I would not call upon her at present. I must satisfy myself beforehand. Hour after hour, every day, I kept my post, and observed her leaning mournfully upon her hand, her eyes fixed, not upon the windows of my apartment, but, strange enough, upon other windows of the house, as though she were watching my mother or my sister. A terrible suspicion shot across my brain. A near relative, of whom I have not spoken, and whose name I will not now mention, was for a time a member of our family, and my bitter enemy. He was, or affected to be, my rival always. Had he been at work in my absence? There was more than regret in Letitia's paleness. I watched and watched. A feel- ing that was more than jealousy, -a feeling which, I almost blush even now to say it- a feeling of sharteful regret, of disap-    <pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6684-00000119"/> 236     WTILL IT CO ME? pointed passion, almost (it was only for the moment, and oh, so cursedly human, that its scar of gehenna is yet in my heart 5) a feel- ing that made me almost curse my OwnI righteousness, almost execrate the self- denial which had ruled my -conduct,- in order to guide the lower powers to serve the higher, -it was this feeling that burnt my soul and gave keenness to my eyes. I watched, and gnawed my heart in watch- ing. It was but too plain: the light I had kindled was gone out. The oil had been burned in the earthy censor. The shrine we had erected to soul was consumedl to ashes. O my God! my God! - the worse than de'ath that I felt at this discovery! I can never describe the faintness, the numbnless, the awful paralysis that came over ime the lava-tides that poured in torrents within me! During the three succeeding weeks I knew nothing. They said they had found me on the floor, and that I had been delirious most   WILL IT COMiE?     237 of the time, night and day- thlat I had barely escaped the grave. But at last the deep, deep night of dark- ness passed; the morning broke, clear, holy, and reviving. I thought upon the share which I may have had in this ruin. Perhaps I had kindled - though all so unsuspecting and innocently-the fire in her bosom, whose flames had laid waste the very soul I would have died to save! I thought, I groaned in spirit, and my heart wept. Alas! its tears fell like rain on withered flowers- "it could not give them vital growth again." I arose from my bed an altered man. '?The growth of years was upon me." I was in a new world, but the new was the sepulchre of the old. O ashes! ashes! of what materials are ye made! -and what prodlucts may we gather from your seem- ilngly insignificant particles! It was weeks after my recovery. Night had begun to settle down upon the earth. I took my hat, threw around me my cloak,    <pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6684-00000120"/> 238     WILL IT COME? and thus at the hour, and nmuffled in the obscurity I love, I stole from the house to take my wonted sad and solitary walk. It was a gloomy evening. A heavy and motionless mass of vapor lay like a crust upon the vault of heaven; a thin, slimy mud coated the uncomfortable streets; and a cold, fine, sleety rain, which seemed to permeate the very texture of one's clothes, drizzled incessant in the unwholesome atmosphere. The sluggish silence of the lonely street, remote from business, the uncertain light of the straggling lamps which shone dim through their wet glass, and the humid air, the inhospitable and re- pelling gloom of the close-shut dwellings, relieved at far intervals by the glare of a butcher's shop, or by the dull red curtain in the dingyu window of a spirit dealer, were in keeping with the sombre climate of my soul, and I strode along with an odd feeling of satisfaction, the effect of my recluse hLabits and my then peculiar mood, as if I were the   WILL IT COlIME    239 spirit of the fog and damp, or as if dark- ness, rain, and I were made to be compan- ions. I now think it was the gathering of the dark web of insanity around me. A gentle touch- a soft, trembling voice that breathed iiy name. The voice was Letitia's! It seemed the echo of my thoughts; and, I know not why, I wrapped my face the closer in the skirt of my mantle, and walked on as if the voice, the touch, had not been real, but the illusion of a dream. Again the touch, but bolder; and again the voice, but more imploring. Distress- fully earnest, and almost choked with sobs, it called on me to stop. "Will you leave me to die in the streets?" "Lctitia! is it you?" "Yes: do you not know me, Frank- Mr. Kingman, I mean.   Oh, are you so changed?" "No! no! not me, Letitia: I am the same; but O God.! how has a little twelve- month changed you!"    <pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6684-00000121"/> 240    WIILL IT COME? She smote her hands together and hid her face. "Unhappy girl, how is it that we meet here! Why do you wander out alone, and at this hour, and on such a night! What have I to do with thee? What notw?" "Have I then no claim to your compas- sion?- none! No! no! I have none. Good-night, sir. I can die like other creat- ures wretched like me." I took her arm as she was moving off. She had a claim to my compassion. I resolved that I would meet it. "Stay, Letitia. What docs all this mean? Speak to me!" "M ean? O Frank, I am a poor, un- happy, wretched girl. I want to die. Why did you leave me? Why did you leave me?"  She burst into tears. She clung to my skirts, and hid her pale, thin face in their folds. I could not be cold to her. I remembered Jesus. I felt not the absurdity of our situa..   WILL IT COE?      241 tion, thus standing shelterless amid the rain and in the public streets. "Poor girl"I whispered, and put my arm, still covered with my cloak, about her, and drew her like a mortified and repentant child to my bosom. "Speak, Letitia: what is it distresses you? Why is it you have come to seek me on such a night?" "Let me hide my shame in your mantle" (sobs) "Mymother" (sobs) "diedthis morn- ing. The last friend!" (sobs) "had on earth is cold in the home I can no more inhabit." (Hysteric sobs, almost to convul- sions.) I held her close- closer-- lest she fall senseless upon the earth. "I killed her; and I shall kill you/" (choking, convulsive wailing, that . almost stifled me.) "She has left nothing. Our little furniture must go to pay our debts. To-morrow - to-morrow, Frank-Letitiia is without a home to shelter her-without a bed to lie on, or a crust to eat. She cannot live the life of-" her whole frame con- "    <pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6684-00000122"/> 242     WILL IT COME? vulsed at the thought of the word she could not utter, her limbs refused their office, she seemed in a swoon, and hung, a leaden weight, in my arms. "Letitia! Letitia! in God's name, speak! Lift up your head! There, now, do you hear me? It is H it is Frank who holds you. You have a right to my protection: it is yours. You shall not quit your home or you shall change it for a better one. I will see to it to-morrow. Leave all to me to me, your only friend." She raised her head; she looked up to my face. "Are you God?" she said; and, without one word further, turned from me, and walked away. Was she insane?- was she going home? I stood for a minute confounded. I then stepped quickly after her. As I approached, I saw in the dim light of one of the street lamps her whole frame shiver, and ere I touched her, the poor creature had set herself upon the cold, damp   WILL IT COME      243 stone at the door of a house, in the utter helplessness of feminine despair. I tried to raise her. Why, Letitia, what is this? Did you not hear me?" Go!--go!" she answered, motioning me away; "leave me. Let me starve, rot; I never can look you in the face again. Oh, your eyes are burning me worse than the dead gaze of the mother I killed! Go away, Mr. Kingman!-leave me to my misery;" and wringing  her hands, she lifted her staring eyes, and added, with a tone that made my blood run cold, " for don't you see I am dead-and my soul burning in the fire that can never be quenched! And you are dead and mother is dead, -and you are pitying angels, and drop tears over the great gulf-but the tears burn worse than the fire." I tried again to raise her; I sought to soothe her by all the kind words and gentle tones at my commnand. I knelt ly her side;  I had never prayed before; I had never         F    <pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6684-00000123"/> 244     WILL IT COME? asked a boon of heaven till then; but my soul seemed now to float away from my body; I don't know what I said, but I thought of Jesus and the Magdalene, and I felt thhat heaven ust open and speak a com- fort to this stricken girl. For a long time my efforts were ineffect- ual; all she would say was to beg me to leave her, or "let me die--let me die." But at last she permitted me to draw her arm through mine, and thus I succeeded, though with much real difficulty, in conduct- ing her to the door of her now desolate home, that home darkened for ever of its sunshine, and left vacant of all but death and despair. Oh, had I then known the name of her betrayer! - had I then known it! But I could not ask it of her  not then. It would have seemed like referring the friend- less orphan to his reluctant care. I persuaded her to trust to my relief. I even succeeded in pressing my purse upon *   WILL IT COME?     245 her; and, promising to see her the next evening, I left her-there, on that little step-there, by that remembered door- and took my post again at my window, to watch through a sleepless night the little cottage -but oh, with what different feel- ings from ever before! The next day I saw Letitia in new and comfortable quarters in a remote city, and said, "Now, Letitia, I have done my duty by you, and you are in a neighborhood where no one knows you, and where you need not fear that prying eyes will mark your situa- tion. Let me speak plainly. I shall see that you want nothing; but I must visit you nevermore. It would only be a sorrow to yourself to have me by, and too hard a trial for my friendship." Letitia bowed down her head in the mortification of a proud and wounded spirit. She wept not; she murmured not. The small hands crossed upon her bosom marked    <pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6684-00000124"/> 246     WILL IT COME? a resignation to my will and submission to leatven that was pleasing and affecting. And froml that hour I never saw Letitia Percival alone. My friend, let me take your hand. It is one of the very few I dare to clasp from the deep places of my experience; and now that you have listened so interestedly and patient- ly to the morning history of this still wild and yearning heart, perhaps sometime you will be kind enough to let me unbosom to your eloquent ears its noonday, if not its evening story: You are, indeed, already aware that Letitia is still, all unknown to mortal being, under my guidance intellec- tually and spiritually, and that her fair cousin -" "Is the bright Phoenix that has arisen from-" "Oh, no! wrong there! She is risen from nothing under heaven; she came down over its flowery bridges-cl out from its pearly gzates-sent as a solace, I sometimes think, from its invisible hosts, to-"   WILL IT CO03E?    247 "To reward so noble a soul as yours," I could not help interrupting, "in its almost unearthly struggles TO BE. O Kingman, you make me feel so small - and yet inspire me, as by a trumpet-blast out of heaven, to such resolves of self-denial and heroic deeds, that I feel almost a renewal of life. I too have an experience, my friend, and the relating of yours comes all in good time, to add another perhaps to the few who are destined to the- the mountains. I will fol- low your glorious example."    <pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6684-00000125"/>   CHAPTER   XVI. THE tie of affection between Nowell and myself was growing stricter every day.  It was no longer. "Nowell," and "Searcher," between us, but "Ellery" and "Leland." Brothers hardly could be more intimate, and, I may speak with certainty for one, brothers never were more fond. The propinquity" of our dwellings favored this socialness; for Ellery would stroll at all hours from his house to mine, and, if he found me not at home, would lounge upon a sofa and caress my dog, or seat himself at the piano, or take up a book, or, more fre- quently, recline him in an arm-chair and wait till I came in. How could I refrain from calling on Ellery in return, oftener than was well, without giving rise to strange suspicions? I "    <pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6684-00000126"/> 250     WILL IT COME? did all I could to avoid it; I speak with due sincerity, I did all I could - except to fly the place. There were times when Ellery would not be at home. For a man who never told his right hand what his left was doing, there was no way to calculate his motions; and thus, not choosing invariably to leave the door, as he had more than once reproached me gently for this ceremoniousness, I was sometimes obliged to enter and await him, and thus would be again nd again thrown into company with Jessie, not always when other persons were by,--beside the ordi- nary visits which accordingl to the custom of the world I waTs bound to render on her own account. Nor was this all. Once or twice, Nowell, having, some engagement to call him out, requested me to stay and entertain his wife; thus contrcastiy my naturally and necessari- ly warmer attelntions with the cold neglect of an iatteztive husband. On one of these occasions, Jessie, directly after he was gone, said to me with great sweetness,   WILL IT COME?      251 ' You must not think it rude of me, Mr. Searcher, if I beg you will excuse me. I1 am too unwell to exert myself, and I know that nothing but politeness keeps you here." I made the reply required, and was mov- ing to'retire, when Jessie, vainly endeavor- ing to master some emotion, burst into tears. What could I do, situated as we were, - I mean so intimate,-- but stay by her, speak condolingly to her -and gently take her hand? anxious yet delicate inquiries of regard, which smooth the voice to its blandest, most seducing tones,- acts of respectful yet affectionate attention, which win their way so softl to a woman's heart; and Jessie, weak of nerves, filled with all her* sex's tenderness and gentle longing for sympathy and pity - confiding also by her own peculiar nature, told me that Nowell's too evident indifference preyed upon her spirits, and was gradually turning bitter all her many sources of enjoyment. Too well I knew that there was more than    <pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6684-00000127"/> 252     WILL IT COMrE? this -that it was Jessie's growing, love for me which made her husband's coldness doubly painful, and that the recent burst of emotion, when Ellery left the room, owed its violence to the consciousness, which then smote her, that her husband was levelling the road direct from his own being to mine. Not that the pure, innocent girl had felt the consciousness in this distinctness, so clear- ly and alarmingly defined; but still the shock was there; for Jessie was no more the inexperienced maiden, but, as a married woman, must have been awake to the nature of her sentiments for me, and aware of the nature of their indulgence. One act of indulgence naturally induces another; and at our next interview Jessie, before she was aware, I am sure, oh, very sure, of what she was doing, told me- every thing, indeed, which she should not have told me, respecting her engagement, marriage - all. I writhed while I listened; writhed because it was about my friend that    WILL IT COME?     253 ,Jessie spoke; and listened while I writhed, because it was that friend's own wife to whom I listened, and I could not bid her pause. What so dangerous as such confidence, even where affection does not previously exist 1 My eyes were opened. The next day I sent my card to Nowell, resolved to leave town without calling upon himl again; for I saw plainly enough that-to do so I should certainly declare a passion which should never escape the lips, whatever power it might have over the heart. I should have gone at once. But this was one of those strange resolutions which men of my ardent temperament often adopt, when the imagina- tion, engrossed by one. particular object, is unduly excited, and the other faculties are kept in temporary inaction; and which men of tamer spirit always ridicule or unjustly weigh in -the vulgar balance of right and wrong, goodness and iniquity.    <pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6684-00000128"/> 254     WILL IT COME? I could not leave without one last look, just one little good-bye; what harm? It was al hour when I knew Ellery would not be at home. I entered without cere- mony. Jessie was preparing to go out. That which seemed so natural, nay, so necessalry, to be said a moment before, died upon my lips. I was confounded. I stam- mered, the color fled my cheeks, the perspi- ration started to mly forehead. "Mr. Searcher! Speak, sir! What is the matter?" "Madam-" "Has any thing happened - to my hus- band -- to Mr. Nowell?" "Not yet, thank heaven." "My God! what do you mean? Do not keep lme so uneasy!" "I alarm you. Pardon me. But I feel so bitterly -I am - " "Mr. Searcher! Are you sick, sir? You look pale and anxious and distressed; sit down; what do you mean? You would not worry me?"   WILL IT COME?     255 "Oh, no!" "Do but speak, then, sir! Something is wrong. What is it that you mean?" "Mean? Can you ask me wh'at I mean?" My looks, my language could not be mis- taken. Jessie's beauty, the tenderness of her alarm, the thrilling softness of her voice, had done their work; and, the spell of my confusion broken, I stood before her in that fatally excited mood when nature gave me eloquence, and as I spoke, Jessie, after one moment's struggle to command herself, only  sank into a chair and hid her face. "No words are necessary," I said. "Too well we both know more than mortal tongue can tell, and what human lip must not, shall not express." "Leave me, sir, while I have breath to bid you Tgo." "Yes, Jessie, I have come for that: I am here only to say farewell, and leave you for ever. This night I am gone, I may not say    <pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC6684-00000129"/> 256     WILL IT C01lE  where, but beyond all possibility of harm to thee, or of throwing one shadow ovel the already too unhappy fate for one so worthy of heaven!" Jessie clasped her hands. I threw myself at her feet. I could not help it. I caught one of those precious hands in my own. She seemed too much overcome to remove it, and hid her' face with the other, while the convulsive heaving of her breast betrayed the conflict in her mind. At last she sobbed out, "Going for ever!" "Yes: it is all over, all over now;" and lifting the hand I held I pressed upon it one long, last, only kiss, and murmuring her namel, tore myself away. Home! home! delirious, - soul and sense steeped in a flood of emotions I know not how to describe. Mad! mad! my blood all fever, my brain all flame! Not another hour must I stay in town than ,was necessary, not the fraction of a minute,   WILL IT COME?  '   257 were it to obtain a world. I thought of the example of Kingman, which I had prom- ised to follow.  I sat down to write to Ellery.  What could I write? I abhor a lie -loathe it be- yond all other littleness even such fialse- hoods as the world excuses, or, with its accommodating breath, commends as amiable equivocation. I could not write the abomi- nable meanness. . I tore the sheet. What need of an apology? Let him fancy some reason for my flight, or set it down if he please to a capricious and inconstant humor. The day was wearing. I had postponed my intended departure till nine o'clock the next morning. Already I had the carriage at the door, when a servant of Nowell's handed me a note.  "From Mrs. Nowell, sir." I tore it open, and read these words; I know not what I write, nor why. You are going. It is all I know--all I feel or see or hear. Come to me once more, if it be but for a moment.             JESSIE. I    <pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6684-00000130"/> 258     WILL IT COME  Surprise - confusion - delirium; and the next minute I was on my way to Jessie. I flew up the stairs -I rushed into the room. Jessie made one step to meet me, and fainted in my arms. I did not wish to ring for help-I durst not bear her to 'the casement. A phial of salts stood upon the mantel-tree. I put it to her nostrils; I whispered anxiously her name  Jessie, Jessie --I kissed her forehead, her eye- lids. She revived - those snowy lids un- closed -she raised to me those eyes of singular beauty; but when she met my gaze, alnd felt the pressure of my arm, she closed themi again and shuddered. I bore her to a sofa, and, still supporting her, knelt at her feet, and took her hand. "Speak to me; Jessie! It is I, - I am here, at your feet. Oh, speak to me!" "Yes, yes, I know that it is you," she an- swered, in a tone of mingled tenderness and grief: "I know it only too well. I cannot bid you leave nie, yet I should not wish for you to stay."   WILL IT COME?     259 "You shall not, must not, have that trial, bright, pure being! Unblemished and snow-white you shall remain; and I will be strength for us both." "And why, then, are you here, sir - why are you here? Is it not by my appointment? Did I not send for you, entreat you to come to me?- though I should have died sooner than look on you again. I feel-I feel it! - though the heart yearns - though the soul calls -yet my face is burning with my shame. Go, sir, go-go." "I will obey you." I rose--I murmured "Farewell!" "Ah, there! there! It is that, that which has bewildered me - made me desperate; you-you are right, sir-go-while I have - while I have - strength." The agony which rent my heart as I clasped a chair with which to steady my steps to the door, was too great for Jessie. The bewildered woman clung to my arm. She leaned her head upon my shoulder.    <pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6684-00000131"/> 260     WILL IT COME? "Yet-yet- one moment"-her hold re- laxed - she sank back upon the sofa. The door opened. "Leland, mon ami!" said the voice of Ellery; and Ellery Nowell himself stood before me! I turned slowly round, and facing him, pointed to his wife, who lay senseless on the sofa. Ellery stood motion- less, looking on us with mingled incredulity and amazement. Never was such a picture as that noble being then presented. At first he approached me and gazed doubtfully in my dry and burning eyes. Then he turned him to the senseless form of his wife, shuddered, grew deadly pale, and put his hand across his brow, as if the brain were bursting its confinement, and he would restrain it. The hand dropped. He was as white as ashes. He moved a step towards me. As he did so, Jessie breathed deeply, sighed, and half- opening her bewildered eyes, saw her hus- band, and shrieked in a terror that made my   WILL IT COME      261- heart stand still. He looked at her one moment, stifled a groan, and then said, in a voice sublimely deep and mournful, "Hush, Jessie, precious. It is all well. I see how it is-I have long seen it. God is love. He doeth all things well. You are lovers. Hush, please. You can't help it, though you have not acknowledged it even to your- selves. And Leland is here, bravely yet foolishly, to leave you for ever, and break your heart, and stifle his own. Leland, mon ami, let me take your hand. Jessie,- not a word, my'pet, -let me take yours. Now, who shall separate us? Shall things present or things absent, shall tribulation or anguish or principalities or powers or heights or depths or any other creature?" Dumb with amazement as I had the min- ute before been sunk in gloom; overpow- ered, bewildered, carried out of myself, lost in a million emotions, so new, so unexpected, so sudden, I uttered not a word, but as a little child led to the altar for baptism, I saw    <pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC6684-00000132"/> 262     WTTILL IT COME? nothing, felt nothing, sensed nothing; but am now dimly conscious that I knelt Dy the sofa there, that Ellery too knelt, and Jessie seemed to come to herself, and, without a murmur, threw her slender arms around both our necks, leaned her fragrant head upon our shoulders alternately, while her fair tresses, all dishevelled, fell like a veil around the group.   CHAPTER   XVII. THE visit of Kingman to the home of his hitherto proud enemy, James Otis Aidens, was not concluded at the close of the 14th chapter of this book. As the cool of the evening came on, Aidens proposed to Kingman to enjoy it in a ramble without. Accordingly, the host and his guest strolled forth, leaving Elzie with the patient sufferer, Letitia. "I need not say," said Aidens, smiling, "how surprised I am, and most agreeably so I assure you, that I have been so mistaken in one I thought myself acquainted with till now." A slight smile curled the lip of Kingman, but he suppressed all emotion instantly, and quietly remarked, "Ah, yes, we are all    <pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC6684-00000133"/> 264     WILL IT COME? liable to surprises; but in what, pray,-were you mistaken?" "I was mistaken, sir, in regard to your whole character," said the proud man, blunt- ly. "I thought your seemingly inactive life an indolent one. I thought your sentiments, as I heard them second-hand,- the persist- ent and eloquent protestations of your fair friends of my family to the contrary not- withstanding, -infidel, and your principles dangerous." "eThis may all be true enough," replied Kingman, with a low, soft, measured tone, and looking solemnly and steadfastly into his companion's eye. "No: not as I now understand you, Mr. Kingman; but allow me to say that there is one thing at which I am still more surprised than at my most unhappy, and, I may as well add, most blundering, mistake of you." "I shall be most happy to explain, Mr. Aidens, believe me." "Then excuse me, sir, but a man who cart   WILL IT COME      265 persuade James Otis Aidens almost out of his very senses, and that seemingly without an effort; who can take him from his own proper self, and hold him spell-bound, fasci- nated, rooted to the spot, forgetting that he has a personal existence, can call a world to his feet. And my surprise, my wonder is, that the whisper of fame does not animate you, or the voice of heaven call upon you to go forth into the world, and receive at the same time the homage of men and the sanc- tion of God." "Listen to me, sir," replied Kingman. "When I was somewhat younger than I am now, I went to hear a celebrated lecturer. His theme was ' MAN,' which he treated most scientifically, anatomically, physiologically, and metaphysically; illustrating and simpli- fying every part of the two hours' lesson most thoroughly, eloquently, and with a power over his audience I had seldom, if ever, seen equalled. It was a lesson full of the noblest thoughts that speech could utter, 12    <pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6684-00000134"/> 2G6    1WTILL IT' COE? every thought blossoming with beauty and fruited with spirituality as with asphodels. "The audience, I have said, listened with attention, with admiration, with applause. I said to myself, when the speaker retired, 'It must be a glorious thing to obtain this empire over the intellects and souls of men.' But the next evening a mountebank appeared upon the same platform, - a man of extraor- dinary strength and sleight-of-hand. About the same audience had gathered as on the previous evening. He performed a variety of juggling tricks, and distorted his body into a thousand -unnatural and surprising pos- tures. The beholders were delighted, trans- ported beyond themselves. If they felt de- light in the lecturer, they glowed with rapture at the mountebank. They had listened with attention to the lofty thoughts ; but they were snatched from themselves at the marvel of the strange posture and the wondrous trick. 'Enough,' thought I: 'I correct my former notion. Where is the glory of ruling men's   WILL IT COME     267 minds, and commanding their admiration, when a greater enthusiasm is excited by mere bodily agility than was kindled by the most wonderful emanations of genius?'" "Too true, too true; and yet the world is waiting, Mr. Kingman," said Aidens, "for just such talent as yours, to correct this very' fault, - to change this tendency to frivolities into nobler channels, to nobler ends; and though you may turn with disgust from such an exhibition of the lightness and frivolous character of mankind, yet you will not let truth ache for your help, and humanity suffer for what you in your abundance have to give?" "Oh, no: not so far as in my humble way, in private life, I can forward the one or alleviate the other." "But why not in a public way, Mr. King- man? See how the poor, the ignorant, the unfortunate, are crying to heaven for help; and how much more they need it if they do not petition heaven!"    <pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6684-00000135"/> 2G8     WILL IT C01ME 1 "Oh, yes," said Kingman, in a low, deep tone; "when will these terrible foes of men be banished from  the world? How many otherwise noble natures, how many glorious hopes, how much of the seraph's intellect, have been crushed into the mud or blasted into guilt, by the three forces of which you speak,-poverty, ignorance, misfortune! It is a hard thin t to think of. It makes a man's heart sick to look around him . "And for this very reason I would urge men like you, Mr. Kingman, to go forth and do battle for the right, now crushed under the feet of the heedless millions." "Yes; but what can be done, my friend, but to forward civilization? And what is civilization but an increase of human dispar- ities? Even the dreams of the philanthro- pist and the reformer only tend towards equality; and where is equality to be found but in the state of the savage?" "Well, then, if teachers, moralists, and   WILL IT C03IE?    269 reformers can do but little towards universal good, what of the Christian preachers, Mr. Kingman?" "Christian preachers of the right kind may do a world of good, Mr. Aidens. You ob- serve that I emphasize 'the right kind.' If, like the luminous yet simple life of the Mas- ter in whose name they teach, they live; if, like his teachings, theirs are the voices of nature blended with those of the spirit-" and kindling, as he ever did, the moment he approached a subject so dear to his heart, Kingman led his listener on through the va- rious paths and labyrinths of nature, -the lilies, the birds, the forests, rivers, seas, stars, suns, systems, - giving each a tongue that was eloquent, not only of intellectual significance, but of spiritual teaching and in- fluence, -" if the earth-beat and sea-beat are one with their own heart-beat, and all make the tune to which the sun rolls, and the globule of blood, and the sap of trees; if the light of their faces is the light of day,    <pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6684-00000136"/> 270     WILL IT COME? and their words the language of the lily and the raven, - then will Galileo's wave roll around the world a baptism of heaven, and the garden of Gethsemane become a para- dise restored!" "Is not the preaching of the present day, in this country at least, tending in this direc- tion, Mr. Kingman?" "No doubt it is. I could name many bright examples were it necessary. Intellec- tually, the standard is elevated, and will doubtless continue to be more and more elevated, and truer to nature as to heaven; and hope, though inot often seconded by faith, whispers of a corresponding improve- ment in the spirit of preaching, as also in the life of the preacher. Much of this improve- ment, I think, is due to woman. The sim- ple, natural sentiments of Jesus, and his pure life of love, with his devotion to duty and his suffering lot, are peculiarly, in- stinctively, understood and appreciated by the gentler sex; and, embodied in and find-   WILL IT COME?     271 ing expression from her soul and lip, it is as if we viewed before us the incarnation of the love of heaven; and it is no wonder that men, at least, warm towards the objects that seem the living apparitions of all that was  tender at the cross and hopeful at the sepul- chre." "I hardly need say, Mr. Kingman, how surprised, and, shall I add, pained, I am to hear you express such a sentiment as the last. A gentleman of your erudition, sir, so profound of judgment in other things, to join hands with fanatics, excuse me, sir, I am a frank-spoken man, -to avow yourself an abettor of this new, and, may I not add, crazy, woman's-rights movement!" "Excuse me. in turn, my friend," calmly interrupted Frank Kingman; "I was not speaking of woman's rights or of woman's wrongs, -which, by the way, were a pro- lific theme for either moralist or preacher: I was speaking of woman as an ambassador for Christ, as a minister of his simple,    <pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6684-00000137"/> 272     WILL IT COMLE P natural, hopeful, charitable Gospel; and as such, I hail and would help her on. Have you, my friend, heard one of these living evangels?" "I? -oh, no, sir. My lovely niece has given me no slight uneasiness in regard to this very matter, and has so infected my daughter with her foolish notions, and so carried away her childish sense with her harangues both in public and private, that I have seriously thought, and still think, a separation will be necessary, and that soon, if I would save my child." "Mr. Aidens," said Kingman, in his peculiarly measured and solemn tones, "you have two angels in your house, both full-winged for heaven, and I fear you know it not. Of your precious Elzie I will not speak now. The time has not yet arrived when I can unbosom to you the soul that even she has scarcely looked into. But your niece,-do you not hear the murmur of admiration on almost every lip? do you not   WILL IT CO01E?     273 see the awards of praise in the papers, of the bright, pure being whose shelter is your honored roof? Yes; and yet you are not aware of the gem she is, the spell she is weaving over the hearts of the people, Dor the substantial fame she is alchieving. You must hear her in, one of her public efforts, Mr. Aidens." There is a certain charm  about great superiority of intellect, that winds into deep affections which a much more constant and even amiability of manners in lesser men often fails to reach. Genius makes many enemies, but it makes sure friends, -friends who forgive much, who endure long, who exact little. But John Franklin Kingman united in himself, to a fine degree, an exalted virtue, manners rarely met with in these times, and genius so blended with the wisdom of the sage and the artlessness of the child, that Aidens saw with evident com- placency, from this first interview, the pas- sion existing between this remarkable man 12*    <pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC6684-00000138"/> 274     WILL IT COiME? and his daughter; and wishing to efface as much as possible the unpleasant feelings that had existed between himself and King- man, he yielded by degrees to his encomiums of his niece, and promised to hear her on the next occasion that offered. Musing on this subject, the proud man, after a few moments' silence, said, "Well, Mr. Kingman, the young ladies will miss us; it is later than I had thought; somehow time passes swiftly with you, sir. We had better return, I think." "Excuse me, my friend: my home is nearer than yours, and as business of some importance awaits me, you will please make my compliments do for the young ladies in- stead of my person; they will readily accept the proxy, sir, knowing as they do the moods of their erratic friend." They parted.  Aidens returned slowly homewards, filled with admiration for the man he had so   lately contemned, and dreamily pondering on the gentleness, calm   WILL IT COME      275 temper, and wisdom of Kingman as an as- surance for the permanent happiness of his daughter, and the companionship of his own after-years. Meanwhile Kingman continued his steps along the water's side; and as, with his glid- ing step and musing air, he roamed onward, it was impossible to imagine a form better suited to the tranquillity of the scene. Even the wild birds seemed to feel, as by a sort of instinct, that in him there was no cause for fear, and did not stir from the turf that neighbored or the branches that overhung his path. "So," said he, soliloquizing, "the question is directly before me. Her father is con- quered at last, and without an effort! Truly, Heaven is just. All things are duly in order in His will.  Her father even courts me! and yet I hesitate! Wherefore? O Letitia!

Letitia! O Letitia! it seems almost unna- tural to me-a thought of dread possesses me-to bring another being to the soli- tary shrine which was erected to thee, and which--" here Iingman paused abruptly, and then renewed: "Memory sets us apart and alone in this world, Letitia. Alone! It is as well, perhaps, for love, alas! does not endure, even though the brightest. I trusted once! O woman! type of weakness and of change! creature of impulses! O Letitia! must I still brood on and on, and wait, shut up the avenues of sense, and sear these yet green and soft emotions of youth? -and yet, poor lost Letitia, thy gentle cousin, one whom I have seen but little, but whom to see, if only for a moment, is to love, and seeing as I did, -I, all seared and withered in leaf and flower, curdled in feel- ing, heart, brain, all as I was,-thy fairy cousin!-her voice rings on my ear, her   WILL IT COME?     2" look dwells on this darkened heart. Like sunlight and shadow are her spirit and thine to this worn and weary soul. When I sleep ye are both with me: when I wake I am haunted with both images, and spell-bound between the two. LIetitia -Elzie!" But we are not about to close this chapter without a glance into the chamber which Letitia and Elzie occupied in common. The night was serene and star-lit, and Elzie sat bythe open window, leaning her face upon her hand, and gazing on the lone house of her lover, which might be seen afar across the landscape, the trees sloping round it, and one pale and steady light gleaming from its lofty casement, like a star. "He has broken faith with me," said Elzie. "I shall chide him for it to-morrow. He has gone home without even bidding us good- night; and how can I sleep, thinking of this neglect-and this -this slight, I almost feel it to be - for studies which steal the health- ful hues from his cheek and the very life from his heart!" vi,    <pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6684-00000140"/> 278    WT ILL IT COIE?E Poor Letitia! She knew. another cause for the fading of those hues, the shadows that hung heavily around that heart. But re- straining her feelings, as usual, she replied, simply, - "You are infatuated, Elzie." 'And have I not cause-ample cause?" returned Elzie, with all a girl's beautiful en- thusiasm. "When he speaks, is it not like music? Is it not heaveln to gaze upon him - to note the changes of that majestic counte- nance-to set down as food for memory every look and every movement?   And when the look turns to me - when the voice utters my name!-- O Tishey, have you ever loved? Do you know how I wonder that you are not in love with Frank, and that it is not you who are favored of the gods, in- stead of this little good-for-nothing pupil of yours?" Letitia blushed deeply - blushed from her snowy temples to her still whiter bosom- and then, as the tides rushed back to her   WILL IT COMz E?    279 poor broken heart, she turned deadly pale, as she answered, faintly yet with firmness, "No one can look on and be with your own precious Frank without admiring his talent and revering his character; but love from a woman, Elzie, is seldom given: it is won - and that only by the presentation of the same article as the first condition. You are his idol, and, of course, he having no heart for me, I have none for him. So come to bed, my precious, and let us dream."    <pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC6684-00000141"/> v   CHAPTER   XVIII. HE great week was approaching, -the week of all weeks, so long anticipated by spiritualists, woman's-rights people, labor party, -the Jubilee week of all these com- bined, in which was to be celebrated the union of certain elements to their certain triumph in the politics of the country and in the minds and hearts of the people. The great temple, or coliseum, which was to accommodate half a million of people, and which had been so long in preparation, was completed. Invitations had been sent to every part of the country, to all the people of whatever grade or hue in politics, religion, and social life; bands of music had been en- gaged, at whatever cost, from every State in the Union; the President of the United States had engaged certainly to be present;    <pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC6684-00000142"/> 282     WILL IT COME? and it was rumored, and in many circles believed, that Ole Bull would preside over the instrumental, and Parepa Rosa over the vocal music, on the grand occasion. The press was teeming with notices, conjectures, praises, anticipations, criticisms, and what not, as the press always will on such an anticipated public exhibition; but the fact that created the most newspaporial comment, and drew forth the greatest num- ber of individual expressions of surprise, was the announcement that the lion. James Otis Aidens would preside at the mammoth con- vention! Among the five hundred names for vice-presidents were those most emi- nent in the whole country, whether for mili- tary prowess, congressional fame, pulpit ora- tory, literary merit, or social position, The speakers for the occasion numbered fifty, and were the ablest and most popular of the numerous host who are in the habit of addressing popular assemblies, - selected without regard to their religious opinions or   WILL IT COMET     283 political proclivities. The names that shone in the front rank of these, and on which hung the expectancy of the masses who would compose the vast assembly, were those of Kingman, Nowell, and Letitia Per- cival. On the last mentioned the public hung in peculiar expectancy. Her name was yet fresh in the public breath, all un- touched and stainless as new-fallen snow; around the history of her private life hung a mystery that was all the more interesting as it was utterly implenetrable. Whence she came, how educated, what the experience which gave such consummate power in one so young and withal so feminine, none could guess, though every one was busy at con- jecture. She was the niece, and for the last three or four years the protege, of the honor- able and wealthy James Otis Aidens. This was all curiosity could determine. But every one who had seen and heard her felt sure, especially the gentlemen, that she was an angel, or would soon be one, for the last    <pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC6684-00000143"/> 284     WILL IT COME? time she had spoken to the people in public assembly, her cheek wore, to the enrapt gaze of her listeners, a hue that few had ever seen before, and around her head was a ring, as it were, of flame. Her eyes burned with a steady and deep fire, her lip was firm, and her whole figure, around which a strange lighti seemed to fall like the glory of a halo, seemed indistinct almost, or swelling, as it were, with the determinate energy of the soul to burst its bonds of earth and join the company who seemed to inspire the marvel- lous message that came through her eloquent lips like a rushing tide of heaven. All knew that her life was passed in the deepest solitude, that she was always sur- rounded with books; and there were not wanting vague reports that she had even ex- plored about the whole arcana of science, and ransacked nearly every field of litera- ture and every region of poetry. Pliloso- phers, poets, clergymen, students, bowed in wonder over the wisdom of her discourse,   WILL IT COME      285 and lesser minds sighed as they drank in the burning pathos of her words.  Old and young, all sects and all parties, united in applause and enthusiasm for the yet un- known  beauty who  so enchained their thoughts and elevated, at the same time she kindled, their emotions. The people poured in from every part of the country by the tens of thousands. The trains from every direction were loaded every day for a week or more. The public-houses were running over, and every private dwell- ing was besieged by the multitudes, who seemed willing even to make sheds and barns their temporary homes, so great was the ex- citement and so intense the interest awakened in the public mind. A procession was formed, according to an arrangement that taxed the skill and wearied the patience of amateur marshals for many days previous, which we will not undertake to describe, only to state generally that it was estimated to be the largest ever mar-    <pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6684-00000144"/> 286     WILL IT COME? shalled in any country, numbering hundreds of thousands, reaching over tell miles in its sinuous course around the city. Militia, fire- menl, Massons, Odd Fellows, Sons of Tem- perance, police, were out in full uniform, :and over four thousand ladies, mounted on elegant horses splendidly decorated, had beautiful sashes around their waists and long white plumes streaming from their flower- wreathed heads, giving the grand army of civilians, mounted, in carriages, on foot, of governors, councils, congressmen, city offi- cials, the masses of the people, a picturesque appearance seldom witnessed in either a civil or political procession. The opening lday, as indeed the entire week, was most auspicious. The sun was clouded occasionally, but only just enough to shield from his otherwise too brilliant beams the weak eyes of the aged and infirm and the adipose tissues of the unwieldy, who flocked with the masses from every part to help make up the grand whole. On marched the in-   WILL IT7 COIME?     287 mense concourse to the music of some seven- ty-five of the best bands of the nation. On they marched, steady, firm of step, solemn and stately; on through the principal streets, avenues, parks, squares of the great city; on, on, to the mammoth building, "The Temple of Liberty."  In the centre of this uuparalleled structure was the platform, elevated fifteen feet from the floor. It was built of rough timber and plank, on a circle of one hundred feet in diameter at its base, the circles narrowing some five feet to every step in its ascent, giving a diameter at its top of about twenty-five feet, around which was a railing, and in the centre of which was the speakers' stand and the chair of the pre- siding officer of the convention. The circles were all splendidly decorated with ever-- greens, flowers, flags, curious devices, and mottoes, and arranged with elegant arm- chairs, in which were seated the vice-presi- dents and dignitaries; the honored chief magistrate of the nation occupying a seat    <pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC6684-00000145"/> 288     TWILL IT COME? beside the chairman of the meeting. The bands of music were arranged, one at every angle of the huge building, the chorus of fifty thousand voices occupying a balcony across the entire end of the coliseum, built on a level with the speakers' stand. In a balcony across the other end of the building, of the same height and of -about the same capacity, was the grandest military display ever witnessed in any building on the earth. We have not space in which to -describe it. It would occupy at least a dozen pages in this volume. While the procession was making   its grand circuit around the city, the bells were ringing, cannon booming, and fire-rockets ascending in every direction. At last the chairman arose to call the con- vention to order. The deafening shouts, cheers, yells, that followed, shook even the monster building; and the waving of a hun- dred thousand handkerchiefs amid the float- ing of the tens of thousands of flags of   WILL IT COJIE      289 every hue, arid of every nation under heaven, was a sight most pleasing and inspiring to behold. The waving of the chairman's hand was a signal for the bands, and the blessed old na- tional air, "Yankee Doodle," rang out on the startled air from more brass throats than ever gave it utterance at any one time be- fore since the Yankee became a rooted power in the earth. When the bands had concluded, and the deafening shouts of applause from the mul- titude had died away, the speakers were announced, each in his order according to the programme; and each spoke his hour, evidently to his own satisfaction, and most )f them to the delight of the vast throngs vho could hear the words uttered. As every speaker retired from the stand, he bands struck up in full chorus, fol- owed by the fifty thousand voices, with an flect never yet witnessed beneath a roof. 'Vithout were booming the cannon, ringing  13                  , J' ' ,? , . "'^s    <pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6684-00000146"/> 290     IT7ILL IT COME? of bells, and discharging of fireworks of great splendor. The speeches, well timed, hearty, extem- poraneous all of them, well seasoned with anecdote, terse and pithy sayings, were mostly of about one tendency, though com- posed of different and somewhat of con- tending elements; the tendency for which the convention was called, and the grand union formed, - to call the attention of the world to the consummation of reform in labor, woman's rights, and religion. The week, the glorious week, was drawing to a close. Most of the stars of American oratory had been seen by the delighted and appreciative people; but there was one yet to rise upon their long-expectant eyes. For that one, many, most of the convention in- deed, had remained in town through the entire week, determined not to leave till they had heard the wonderful being whose praise was in every breath. At length the blessed hour arrived.   WILL IT COxE      29 Simply but richly dressed, with no show of cAk'gnon, flounce, long skirt, jewelry, nothing that the mo st icious or critical taste could object to either ill one etreme or the other,-Letitia Percival ascended the platform, led by John Franklin ingman, and accompanied by her scarce less beautiful cousin, Elzie Estelle Aidens. At first a murmur, like the low hum of bees, which gradually grew more audible till it seemed the far-off plaintive boom of the sea rolling in, and surging louder and louder, sounded up to the ears of the fair. idol of the occa- sion as she ascended the lofty stand that overlooked the teeming thousands, and on Which so mucll talent and genius, the nation's best, had preceded her own.  When she had gained the summit and stood for a brief moment with one of her Imall lily hands in that f the nation's xe tive, and the other held by her proud uncle,  he chairman, the murmur of this mighty ea of human beings burst into a roar so ' '   *    '           M i    <pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC6684-00000147"/> 292     WILL IT COIE? loud, so almost terrific and prolonged, that the chairman had to wave his hand a number of times for order, and failing each time, he made the sign to the bands, and gave the usual signal to those in charge of the cannon outside the "Temple."  These sounds of music and applause combined, succeeded finally in restoring the people to their senses nnd the desired silence, and were the sin- gular prelude to the most singular effusion that followed. As the fair orator stepped forth a few paces, leaving the supporting hands that had steadied her through this long prelude of applause, to stand out alone, at once a na- tion's idol and its oracle, a hush as of death fell over the multitude, and every one of that vast assembly seemed to stifle the sound of his own respiration, so anxious was each to hear, to catch every word that might fall from the wondrous beauty's lips. But the beauty which had so riveted the eyes and delighted the senses of smaller assemblies,   WILL IT C01JE?     293 on less occasions, and in former days, was gone. The rose had faded from the match- less cheeks, the cherries had fallen from the rich, ripe lips,- even the beautiful contour was wanting, -  the hitherto rounded propor- tions and curved outlines so essential to physical beauty, according to Hogarth and Sir Joshua Reynolds, having given place to angularities and sharply defined proportions. The lustrous, soulful eyes, so singularly liquid and brilliant, were still the beautiful windows through which angels seemed to look, but the look was now more of death than of life; and the wreath of amaranth and of asphodels that crowned her elegant and stately head, was only too fitting to the unearthly pallor that overspread her feat- ures. The people saw this great change, they noticed it minutely; and it gave an added charm to their sensibilities, while it loaded them with sympathy almost to oppressive- ness; and they were thus well prepared    <pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC6684-00000148"/> 294     WILL IT CO31E? for what they might not have otherwise been able to account for, the peculiar, and, to most of the patient and admliring listeners, vague, impracticable, aesthetic and poetic discourse that seemed to float through her lips rather than uttered by her tongue. Of course no pen can report this most singular production; but we will endeavor to give the reader as faithful a transcript as is possible to our humble skill in this liue. Here it is:-   CHAPTER   XIX. TN thanking you for this cordial greeting, the generous welcome with which you honor me, I am well aware that it is a tribute to no mere personal merit, but to the interests of humanity, which we are all here to serve. It is the awakened hope and ex- pectation with which the hearts of a suffer- ing, patient, and free people turn towards any voice raised to alleviate and elevate, to enlighten and to save. This temple yet rings with the eloquence of a world to this great end. Thanks to a beneficent Providence, the long night of years is giving way to. this sunburst on foreign hills, so long preceded by star-gushes, which good men and women everywhere have looked up to on bend- ed knee and patiently asked, 'Will it Come?" Thank God! that the school-    <pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6684-00000149"/> 296     WILL IT COME? house and the free home and the Stars and Stripes have at last inaugurated a Union like this, and educated and fortified men and women like these,-men and women who have pondered and questioned, and analyzed the questions, many and stern, that nature and spirit are putting for ever and ever; men and women who have learned the physiology, physiognomy, politics, geography, pride, freedom, friendship of these States; the sub- stratums, compacts, objects, hopes, consti- tution of the whole land; men and women who are faithful to things, and who teach whatever :laud and sea, the bodies and souls human beings teach; who have sped through customs, laws, popularities, coteries, schools, and can now hold themselves ag:ainst .ill se- ductions, follics, whirls,.contentions, reviews, criticisms, hates, lies, and animating- to life itself, possessing themselves with the spirit of impartiality, forbearance, justice, and love; teach my brothers and sisters, not : mere tale or myth, or prettiless, or rhyme,   WILL IT COM E      297 or a nondescript, but what answers univer- sal needs; whose words lift and fill them, enabling them to face the open fields, the seaside, the roadside, the face of men, the face of day; whose spirits so accompany their voice that it slall absorb them as they absorb food, air, light, growth; to reappear in manners, strength, nobility, cheerfulness, benevolence, charity, and personal worth; who are the doers, lovers, positive knowers, satisfiers, that all people's hearts yearn to salute; who have so interfused themselves with such things, that everybody they meet should look lovingly upon them; who in all the depths of their souls, and in the spirit of the Infinite, are brothers of rejected per- sons, brothers of slaves, felons, idiots, luna- tics, diseased persons, and whose manners to these are as superb as the days, and constant as the nights! Oh, then, my brothers and sisters, speak on!

It is vain to skulk. Be the just man you seek. Be the most cautious, the firmest, the proudest, boldest, truest, happiest, most benevolent, most lavish man or woman of the earth! For all verges to the soul, all has reference to what ensues;   all that you do, say, think, is of consequence; every move made, every effort of an hour, tells through the indirect lifetime. The interest will come round;  it will come, every brave action, help given to strangers, the poor, sorrowful, old, the sick, the shunned person, figitives; all self-denial that stood steady and aloof on wrecks, and saw others fill the seats of the boats, all offerings to friends or strangers of substance or sympathy, all pains of enthusiasm  for truth, all the limitless sweet love and precious suffering of mothers, and  the grandeur of the great yearning heart of   WILL IT COME?      299 fathers in the suggestions of the divine in their souls towards their sons out of the way or in the way, all that is well thought or said this day or any day on any part of the globe, all are carefully treasured - inure, have inured, shall inure to the identities from which they sprang or shall spring. Nothing lives only its moment. Speak on, O sons and daughters of men! With your pass-key of hearts,.your welcome shall be universal,-- welcome and universal as the flow of beauty and the intoxication of music. Be the summons, challenge, and answerers to the beating hearts and unutter- able souls walking in shadows.  Breathe gently through their tremblings the assur- ances of men and women pro-occupied of their own souls, that whatever is known at a given time, there waits more to be known of all men and by all men; that beside the persons now seen, actually  walking the earth, are persons with calm and actual faces not seen; that there are realizations not    <pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6684-00000151"/> 300     TTILL I T CO ME? dreamed of now, and which no imagination can grasp, waiting on the earth and through the spaces for all limitless souls, -and all are limitless; that the majesty and beauty of the world is latent in every spirit, and orbs and systems play their swift sports through the air on purpose for the Lgand possession of souls, and that each shall one day be eligi- ble to do as much and be as much as any; that there are more in trivialities, insects, vulgar persons, slaves, dwarfs, weeds, rejected refuse, than the wisest suppose; that there is infinitely more in men and women than is or ever has been supposed; that even applar- ently temporary affairs keep on and on mil- lions of years; that interiors have their ilteriors, and the eyesight has another eye- sight, and the hearing another heearing, and the voice another voice, and that whatever happens anywhere, or at any time, is pro- vided for in the inherency of things; that the glory and extract of all, the tuft and final applause of the universe, is a man, and   WILL IT COME       301 the beauty and sweetness and crown of man is a woman.

The heavens bend lovingly, tenderly, over the euarth, and from the nuptial couch of the vernal season, lo! what growths of beauty peer from the leaf and the mould! what health in the blood of herbs, roots, orchards, grains! and out of the seeming death what beautiful and exultant life, life in all its varied and beautiful forms, life glorious, rich, redundant, hearty, electrical, modest, retiring, loving, watchful, earnest - out from the death and the rottenness, out from the seeming dull and cold andcl'insensate earth,- earth full of decay and filth, heaped with distempered corpses, worked over and over with sour dead, and reeking with the foul liquid and meat of drunkards and gluttons   WILL IT COIME      303 of millions of generations! Run a furrow with your plough, press a spade through the sod, and lo! this is the compost of billions of corpses, and what billions of diseases! and yet behold! the grass covers the prairies, the bean bursts through the mould in the garden, the apple-buds cluster on the branches, the blade of corn and the spire of wheat rise gently from their wintry graves; the tinge awakes over the willow tree and the mulberry; the ,birds carol morning and evening from their nests 'in the leafy boughs; the beautiful flowers cover the wayside; the new-born of animals ap- pear, and the summer's growth and bloom and beauty are as innocent and glorious and charming as though the source whence they sprang were the clear sweet blue above them, and not the strata of sour dead beneath them! What chemistry! what magic! what miracles! that the winds are not infectionl; that the wxaters we drink and lave in are not poison; that all is clean for ever and ever;    <pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC6684-00000153"/> 304     WILL IT COME? that the cool drink from the well tastes so good and is not full of the fevers deposited in the bed whence it springs; that black- berries are so flavorous. and juicy; that apples, oranges, melons, grapes, peaches, plums, will none of them distemper us; that when we recline on the grass, we do not catch the disease from which every spire is springing! Oh, the earth! how calm and patiently it grows such sweet things out of such cor- ruptions! turning harmless and stainless on its axis with such endless successions of corpses; distilling such exquisite winds out of such infused fcetor, renewing with such unwitting looks its prodigal annual sumptu- ous crops, giving such divine materials to men, and accepting such leavings from them at last! Oh, realism and miracles! what else is tltre on the earth? Whether you walk the streets, cr cast your eye over the roofs of houses, or wade with naked feet along the   WILL IT COME?     305 beach, or stand under trees from which great melodious thoughts drop upon you or wan- der musingly in the winding paths of woods, or talk by day with one you love, or sit at table dining with your friend, or look at strangers opposite in the cars, or, watch honey-bees busy around the hive, or animals feeding in the fields, or the wonderful birds and insects in the air, or the fiding glory of sundown slowly giving way to the quiet and loving smiles of the stars and the thin, deli- cate curve of the new moon in May or June: these and every hour of the light and dark, every inch of space, every yard of the earth, every foot of the interior, every spire of grass, the sea, and all its chambers contain of fishes, wrecks, corals, shells, pebbles, its billows, the storms that rouse its power and pitch it into mountains, the ships tossed upon its waves loaded with human lives, what are all these but perpetual and perfect miracles?

Your eyesight is equally as wonderful, and how you were conceived and grew in embryo, and were born and grew five feet high or six feet high; how you were not palpable once, but live and breathe now, and that your soul can embrace your friend's soul a thou- sand miles away, and affect each other even to tears without ever again seeing each other or never vrhaving Seen each other; or that you can think and feel at all, and that the moon spins around the earth and on with the earth, and that both balance themselves with the sun and stars. Oh, what is there in all the vast round, in yourself, in any thing you can name or think or imagine, between Sunday morning and Saturday evening, that is not wonderful, puzzling, amazing, -a miracle? Say to the sons and daughters of men, Let down all the bars, weigh every anchor, pull up every stake stuck in the mud, then lie abstracted and long at the beautiful gates, land ntudge yourself to listen to the ideals of   WILL IT COME?      307 things, and the reasons of things; and the first lesson shall let down the bars to the next, and that to another, and every one to another still; but you cannot tell any per- son what you hear; you cannot voice it to yourself, you will be so filled and ravished. The great round delicious globe moving so exactly in its orbit for ever, without one jolt or the untruth of a single moment -not made in six days, nor in ten thousand years, nor planned or built one -thing after another as an architect plans and builds a build- ing, - the blessed old. earth, round, rolling, compact, with its sun, moon, stars, animals; air, soil, water, fire, watery, vegetable, sauroid advances, beings., premonitions, lisp- ings of the future, a healthy presence, a friendly gesture, a commanding figure; the workmanship of souls; the great masters, sayers, poets of the earthl; beauty, reality, amelioration, truth, manhood, time, life, attributes, growths, effects, - these are the teachers, the uttering tongues, to which you    <pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC6684-00000155"/> 308     WILL IT COMiE  listen! These do not withhold: thoy are generous enough; they continually wait, and are not concealed to the real listener. They are calm, subtle, untransmissible by print; they are imbued through all things, convey- ing themselves willingly to willing ears; conveying both a lesson and an invitation; they utter and utter for ever and ever! And yet they speak not if you do not hear; they do not argue, are not pathetic; have no arrangements; do not scream, haste, per- suade, threaten, or promise; make no dis- criminations; have no conceivable failures; close nothing, refuse nothing; shut none out, and never betray. They do not exhibit themselves, or refuse to exhibit themselves; and yet always notifying, always calling to the children of men; and underne:ath all the ostensible sounds of the world of men, the august chorus of heroes, the wail of slaves, persuasions of lovers, curses of anger, gasps of the dying, laughter of the young people, accents of bargainers,-underneath all these   TWILL IT COME?    309 possessing lessons that never fail. All elo- quelt tongues die; but these dumb voices, of motion, of reflection, of the day and the night, of the voyage we are sailing, never! Will you listen, O my brothers and sisters? Or will you squat, and stifle, and rot your own fruit in yourself, and let the intermina- ble children of the hour, with their twenty- four mothers, pass you every day, big with riches immortal and the fascinations of youth yalnd the glory of age? For none more than for you speed'the moments of time or invite the years immor- tal but not one can listen for another, or acquire for another, or grow for another, or be responsible for another! The song is to the singer, the teaching to the teacher, the murder to the murderer, the theft, to the thief, the love to the lover, the gift to the giver, the oration to the orator, the acting to the actor, - all come back, - they certainly will come -most to each; and no man can, understand any greatness or goodness that is    <pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC6684-00000156"/> 310     WTILL IT COM E? not an indication of his own, or that is not latent in his soul. All things are complete to him or her who is complete; all things are broken and jagged only to him or her who is broken and jagged. And there is nd greatness or power that is not in harmony with the essence of things, and emulates the sweetness and beauty of the sunlight and air. There can be no lesson worth learning, no theory of any account, that does not cor- roborate the lesson of the hour and square w-ith the truth of the morning and evening. No  politics, art, government, compact, creed, or whatever, is of special account or avail, unless it compare with the amplitude of time and the fitness of things. Will you still wait anld watch and listen? Lift up your eyes, then, and see!-little or nothing in audible words! see! all merging towards the presentation of the unspoken meanings; towards the unsung songs, the unuttered and unuttterable truths, and the dictionaries untouched by mortal print; see,   WILL IT COME?     3" in that- which contains itself, which never invites and never refuses, sweeter spasms of love than that which responds love; see that which is better than to tell the best, always to leave the best untold. Behold a dumb man: his tongue, ineffectual on its pivots, is more eloquent than words; his larynx is not obedient to his. respiration, and yet what pulpit ever preached like this walking wonder! The best can never be told. Had Shakspeare sung for ever, could he have exhausted his thought, or told the best of the simplest lily that blooms in the valley? The best cannot be told, and yet "it will come." It is never what you anticipated: it is cheaper, easier, nearer; in the hints of meaning's, in the echoes of tones, in the phrases of souls, in the ever-varied play of forces, in the glimpses of heaven. Oh, listen on and on, my brothers and sis- ters, and hope on, and work on, delve, mould, change, improve, pile high the deeds of beauty; gaze and listen, and work on age    <pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC6684-00000157"/> 312 .

The palm is ready, and the crown sparkling; and the genii of wisdom and spirits of verse, bending with immlortal emerald above the rivers, and over mountains and seas, and across conti- nents and  latitudes, shall impart their mighty and wizard spells at last, and mir- ror in your souls, from the deep wells of truth and the starry regions of poetry, the holiness of the divine, and the glory of the eternal. Ah! my brothers and sisters, have you been sleeping so long, -a lon, long nilght of years,- "With drudging hands and half-shut eyes, Wandering out of Paradise," dreaming dreams! stepping with heavy feet, and wistfully stopping, and advancing, wan- dering and confused, lost to yourselves, ill- assorted, contradictory, pausing, gazing,   WILL IT COlE?    313 bending listlessly, dreamily; the hours re- ceding from you, youth, manhood, and womanhood receding, the earth receding, and you dreaming the same old dreams of other dreamers, who in their turn dreamed the dreams primeval. Onward you move!-- an actor, a voter, a politician, an emigrant, an exile, a criminal, a blackguard, a carpen- ter's son, a merchant, a teacher, a sycophant, a priest, a stammerer, a well-formed person; on in the darkness, and resign yourselves to the dusk. Your hands are spread forth, you pass other sleep-walkers in all directions, you would sound up the shadowy shore to which you are journeying, you hear your own heart-beat, you follow a will-o'-the-wisp, you fade away! Hot checked and blushing and hectic, you would know where your feet stand; what it is that is flooding you, this cry between the silences, these meteor shapes of "clouds at war with sunshine on the hills of life," this infancy and age, and the hunger and thirst, and the smiles and "    <pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC6684-00000158"/> 314     WTILL IT CO IE?  tears that cross the bridge between. The shadows advance, through which you see sparkles of starshine on the icy and pallid earth; you advance along your course your sinews are healthy; perfume and youth course through your veins, hope lights you on and on, and it seems every thing in the light and air ought to be happy. You think heroic deeds are easy, -you are full of them,-you can almost do miracles. Light- hearted, healthy, strong, going where and doing what you list, how you bless the air that serves you with breath to speak! how you bless every olject that calls from diffu- sion your meanings : the light that wraps all things in equable showers, the animals mov- ing serenely over the earth, the birds singing their way through the air, the sprouting growths in the fields, the flowers by the road- side lining the well-worn path you are tread-  ing- all these, and every thing that blooms and breathes, seem latent with curi-us love for you, that whatever you meet likes you   WILL IT CO1E?     315 and wins your love in return. The earth, expanding right hand and left hand; the heavens bending lovingly overhead, all lit up with coustellations; the picture alive in all its parts, and every part in its best light; the music falling in where it is wanted; the cheerful voices along the way; the world be- fore you; the long brown path before you, leading wherever you list,--what space, what room .for great personal deeds, for realization, adhesiveness, love and power and worship! How easy to be tallied, how sure the test of wisdom, the efflux of the soul,-the en- trance through the beautiful gates of the beautiful laws! How easy to be the fluid and attaching character that pervades the air, and flows into you till you are rightly charged! how easy to retain the freshness and sweetness of life's young morning, and carry them into the noonday of manhood and womanhood! The herbs and flowers of the morning sprout no fresher and sweeter every day out of their roots, than truth and good.    <pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC6684-00000159"/> 316     WILL IT COME? will to men shall spring from you. The charm distilled among mankind from your attainments shall moCk the beauty and per- fume of stars and flowers. With power, liberty, the earth, the elements, health, de- fiance, gayety, self-esteem, curiosity, what good cheer and glorious fame can you not accomplish! On, then, with the souls! See, how from their radiant pathway they beckon to you! and see again how all things part away for your progress; all religions, arts, governments, all solid things, all that was or is apparent oni the globe, fall into niches and corners for your progress along the grand soul-road of the universe! Behold! in all other progress, you needed emblem and sustenance! Be- hold! within you, through your smiles, oaths, dancing, drinking, dining, supping, smoking, praying, or what not; inside of dress, ornaments, fashion, inside of the pec- toral muscles and the facial muscles, behold your incentive, in the secret, silent loathing   WILL IT COIE?     317 and doubt and despair that transfix your energies, and impale your soul! No hus- band, no wife, no friend, no lover so trusted as to hear the confession! but there it is! the grim shadow of every one! there it is in your pathway, skulking and hiding, formless and wordless, through the streets of the cities, polite and bland in the parlors, in the cars of railroads, in steamboats, in the public assembly, home to the houses of men and women, among their families, at the. table, in the bedrooms, everywhere, smartly attired, countenance smiling, form upright, death under the breast bone, hell under the skull bones, under the broadcloth and gloves, under the ribbons and artificial flowers! there it is, the nameless, silent, gliding, in- comlprehensible, holding, mocking, cliscour- aging, paralyzing!

Oh, keep on! be not turned back! Divine things are waiting in every fold, in every envelope, things more beautiful than words have told or can tell! From every tree you walk under, large and melodious thoughts shall descend upon you, and summer and winter each shall drop fruits of healing as you pass. On, then, with the blessed words and. deeds and personal qualities! On, where behavior is the finest of the fine arts, where electric deeds are the monuments, where goodness is the head and ideal, where equanimity and justice and mercy are the highest illustra- tions of affairs; where speculations on the real flacts and forces, and inquiries into spir- itual realms are encouraged and freely in- dulged; where the floridness of materials shrivels before an honest look, a convincing. presence! Look that honest look! Be that convincing presence! Be the proof of the race, the ability of the universe! till materi-   WILL IT CO-ME?     319 als are overawed, and the dispute on the soul ceases, and arguments concerning God are heard no more in the earth. Huslh! Did you not hear the angels sing, How, floating on an unseen wing, You left the starry realms on high? The sapphire gates were open swung, And while the matin songs were sung, Forth through the azure of the sky, With folded hands and dreamy eyes You wandered out of Paradise! And o'er this planet, like a bow -Hung in the depths of purple even, Swung flowery bridges, to and fro, O'er which the white-winged seraphs go, Bearing the holy dead to heaven; And passing these, with feet so light They did not bend the dewy bells Of the celestial asphodels, How all the earth grew strangely bright, And all the air grew strangely sweet! And how they clasped your tiny feet, And how their human hearts did beat, As fell like dew among the flowers Your presence in this world of ours! 1    <pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC6684-00000161"/> 320     lWILL IT COJME? And how dreamily and wonderingly by- and-bye you looked up and smiled into her eyes and heart! And further on, with what gushing over-soul you clasped his neck and clung to his lips! And again, as in child- hood's first flush you went forth, how the first object you looked upon you received with wonder, pity, love, or dread; and hovrw that object became a part of you, hung up in your memory, not as a picture in a dwelling, but as a part of your organiza- tion, not only for the day, or for many years, or stretching cycles of years! The early lilacs, the sunflower, the roadside daisies and buttercups, the white and red clover, the morning-glories and cowslips, the song of the "phcebe bird," the lambs, the fgruntilng, litter, the noisy brood of the barnyard, the fishes suspending themselves in the stream, the water plants with their flat heads leaning so gracefully on the lakelet's bosom, the May-flowers and violets, and the corn silk and tassels, and the apple blossoms and   WILL IT COME?     321 fruit afterward, and raspberries, and the com- monest weeds by the roadside, how all these became a part of you! And the old drunk- ard staggering home from the out-house of the tavern whence he had lately risen, and the school-mistress passing on her way to the school, and the friendly boys that passed, and the quarrelsome boys and the tidy and fresh- cheeked girls and the bare-foot negro boy and girl, and all the changes of city and country, wherever you went; and your pa- rents, how they gave you more than your birth, more of't1hemselves than the embryo, how they gave you, every day, the mother with clean cap and gown, a wholesome odor of person, and smile so like an angel, giving her mild words tand loving glances and holy lprayers; the father, strong, self-sufficient, aln- ly, his quick rebuke, his shrewd advice, his yearning and yet half-suppressed affec- tion; the family usages, the language, the coimpany, the furniture, the yearning and swelling hearts that will not be gainsaid, the "*          K    <pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC6684-00000162"/> 322     WIILL IT COME? sense of what is real; the thought if after all it should prove unreal; the doubts of day-time and the doubts of night-time; the curious whether and how, - whether that which appears so is so, or is all flashes and mist; men and women crowding fast in the streets, the walking wonders, the wingless angels; the streets themselves, the homes and what experiences inside the windows, vehicles, teams, the stage-coach, the high- lands, mountains, fields, rivers winding their. musical way through the valleys, shadows, mist, the pattering rain on the roof, the streams of light dancing in at the windows and making golden spots at your feet; boats, vessels walking off on the water like things of life, the trembling wave and crested blil- lows, the strata of rose-colored clouds at sunset, the long bar of maroon-tint away solitary by itself, the spread of purity it lies motionless in, the horizon's edge, the flying sea-crow, the fragrant salt-marsh and new- mown hay - all these, and things innumera-   WILL IT COME?     323 ble became a part of you as you went forth every day, as you now go forth, and will always go forth. And thus all things become a part of you, are tributaries to the river of life you are, flowing on to the infinite sea. You are the spiritual result of all substances, ponder- able or imponderable. From the minutest speck on the insect's powdered wing, to the loftiest star that rolls in space, each particle and every shred of a particle contributes to make you the rooted power and the walking wonder that you are. And you are not only an acme and climax of things, you are an incloser of things. Your feet strike the apex of the stairs of the accomplished and the yet-to-be. On every step bunches of ages, all below duly trav- elled, and still you mount and mount. Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind you of the things you have accrued and inclosed afar down, even to the huge first nothing; for you were there! waiting unseen, sleeping    <pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC6684-00000163"/> 324     TtILL IT CO ME  through the lethargic mist, taking no hurt from the fetid carbon, and biding your time. Long you were hugged close, long and long. And what immense preparations for you! and how faithful and friendly the arms that helped you on! Cycles ferried your cradle, rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen! To make room for you, stars kept aside in their own rings, and suns and systems sent influences to look after what was to hold you; before your fIotal heart pulsated to the heart of your mother, generations guarded you; nothing could overlay the embryo or make it torpid, or hold it with holds; fbr it tle nebula cohered to an orb, the long, slow strata piled to rest it on, vast vegetables gave it sustenance, monstrous sauroids trans- ported it in their mouths and deposited it with care. All forces, all of the known and unknown past, have been steadily employed in the mighty and infinite work of complet- ing you; and here and now you stand on this   WILL IT COME?     325 spot, a living soul! with span of youth, ever-glorious elasticity and enthusiasm of well-balanced, full, florid, healthy manhood or womanhood! Are you not almost suffocated with thanks- giving? How full of worship every morn- ing and evening, and every noonday, every avenue of your being, and how dewy your eyes with a filial trust! Crowding your lips, thick in the pores of your skin, jostling you through the streets, in the public halls, lin- gering around your pillow at night, crying by day, ahoy! from the rocks of the river, swinging and chirping over your head, calling your name from flower-beds, vines, tangled underbrush, or while you lave in kissing waters, or drink from the murmuring rill, or the curtain of evening is slow rolling down from  the skies, following every moment of your life, how the spirit is kissing your temples, suffusing itself through your body, this spirit of appreciation!

And how lovable every thing is! how welcome, the coming of days, every condition promulg'ing new beauty, every incoming season with ineffable grace singing lullabys to the beauties departing, as gracefully nodding its welcome to new ones. Youth gently departing, old age superbly rising, and the hush promulging its shadows, how all are inviting you onward! what sweet in- vitations to worship! Just open your scuttle at midnight. Be- hold the bright constellations! the far-sprin- kled systems! All these as far as your vision, and multiplied unduodecillions are edges of infinite numbers; wider and wider they spread, and higher and higher, and outwarc tland outward for ever! Suns around suns obediently wheeling, lesser inclosec by supe- rior circuits, and greater sets follow in eter- nal gradation. See ever so far, a limitless space is awaiting; count ever so much, the years are still limitless, and their seasons still nod invitations.

For you tramp a perpetual jour- ney! Your shoes are made   of good courage, your garments of hopeful stuff woven, your staff is the pluck- of the faith- ful. Your chair shall be made of the mosses, your pillow if need be of granite, your music the hymns of the zephyrs! your church shall be "the first temples," your phi- losophy that of the sunbeam, your college the dam of the beaver. You shall dine with the dew-drop and lily, and sup with the raven and squirrel. Your exchange shall be glances and heart-beats, your commerce a carrier pigeon. Sit awhile, wayfarer. Here are biscuits to eat, and the honey all waiting, and here is milk, no sweeter is tasted. Sit awhile and renew yourself; sleep if need be, and refresh with a morning bath and clean sweet clothes. *    <pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC6684-00000165"/> 328     WILL IT COME? And the zephyrs of morning with their good- bye music, shall kiss the gum from your eyes, and dissipate the influence of the nightmare dreams of the previous evening. But stop not in the house, however inviting. Stop not even to breathe love or mention death under a roof. In the open air you shall translate and be translated, you shall transport and be transported; you shall in- hale great draughts of air, and breathe it forth the elixir of healinog! You shall see through the strata and the darkness. Away then along the road, up on to the heights, through and through the inviting forests, by the sounding surges of sea-shore and river! the nearest flower is an explanation, a dell of dew is a key, and the wave is a password, of heaven. Think, oh, think! Time is passing! Back through the vistas, the past, recall it! Into the retrospection with all your soul! What do you see? Again, into the future! The ages continued henceforward!   TWILL IT COME?.    329 Have you thought your beginning was twenty, forty, sixty, or a hundred years ago? EacXh particle of you is beginningless. Be- fore Moses or Adam was, you were. And have you guessed you would not continue? Iave you feared the summons and the shroud? Have you trembled at the lifting of the curtain, and dreaded the beyond? Is to-day nothing? Is the beginningless past nothing! If the future is nothing, they are as surely nothing. See the sun rise! -see men and women, flexible, real, alive, mov- ing! See every thing that lives! -living? You and I did not see, feel, think, nor bear our part once! Think, we are now here and taking part! Oh, think, not a second passes without a birth,--not a second without a corpse! Coming in and going out for ever and for ever! The living look upon the dead with curious and staring eyes. But without eyes lingers a different living, and looks curiously on the corpse! The rivers will flow, the rain fall, the fruits ripen, and act O    <pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC6684-00000166"/> 330     WILL IT COME P upon others as upon us now -yet not act upon us then! Others will walk these dell., and enjoy the beauty of rainbow and flower, and bask in the light of love and life, and take great interest in all these wonders of city and country, and we take no interest! How eager in building these houses! how intense the strain of this ambitious scheme! Others shall be just as eager and earnest when we are quite indifferent. These houses serve a few years: a house is waiting to serve us for ever! Do you see these beautiful flowers? these dancing sunbeams? this gay and joyous life? Slow moving and black lines are here also! They creep over the whole earth; they never cease: they are the burial lines! Wake and rise early, for this is the beauti- ful May! - gain, this is its charming sister June! but sit awhile now under the shade, for July and August are hushing periods. Not long, however; for the fruits of autumn are inviting you forth. Alas! bleak are the   WILL IT' C01IE?    331 winds, cold dash the waves: posh and ice are in the streams, half-frozen mud is in the streets, a gray discouraged sky overhead, the short last daylight of December; the physician has given the silent and terrible look; the children have left the room sobbing; the brothers and sisters are sent for; the medicines stand unused on the shelf; the faithful hand of the living does not desert the hand of the dying; the hot lips of agony have pressed their last to the cold forehead; one faithful heart has ceased to beat, and one beats on-oh, so wildly! A hearse and coaches arrive; other vehicles give place - slowly, tenderly, solemnly - on to the house awaitingo! duly rolls on the ear, on the heart, the awful death-bell; the gate is passed, the grave is reached; the living alight, the hearse discloses its treasure, the coffin is lowered and settled decently, the earth is swiftly shovelled in - a mo- ment --oh, that awful moment to some hearts - and it is done!  Decently pitt    <pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC6684-00000167"/> 332     WILL IT COME? away - is that all? is there nothing more? The sky continues beautiful, the flowers bloom on, and the birds sing; the daily house-work, the domestic joys, the business of the street, the building of houses- farms, profits, crops, markets, wages, gov- ernment, all move on as before, and are real, have weight, form, location;- are none of them phantasies: from age to age they remain. But  we are missing - whither? An echo gone to the echoes? thrown to the winds?- diffused among the elements? Slow moving and black lines go cease- lessly over the earth - the shadows approach and pass for ever aifd ever. The strict account is kept- the messenger cannot be eluded. Something long  preparing and formless has arrived -the guest that waited long, for reasons, knocks at the door-the invisible orchestra have tuned their instru- ments sufficiently, the baton has given the signal. And so I go with the rest, and you   WILL IT COME?     333 also go., We cannot be stopped at a given point. We have seen a good thing-a space of time! We must have, according to the essence of things and the argument of the past and present, and the law of promo- tion and transformation, the indestructible breed of the best. Worms and ashes are not the end. If I suspected it, I would die to-day. Pleasantly and well-suited I walks on, :and welcome  is the  transplanter. TWhither I walk I cannot define; but I know by the past and present that the way is good, and the whole universe indicates it! To appreciate, to realize this is the great requisite! O soul, soul, soul! I cannot define, cannot measure, cannot sense thee,  and yet I know thee--know of thy exist- ence in this temple of clay! I cannot define this hour's satisfaction, and yet I am satis- fied! I cannot define this mpoment of con- scious life, and yet I live! Oh, is there any thing but immortality? Is not the whole exquisite scheme of the Infinite for it?    <pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC6684-00000168"/> 334     WILL IT CO0r?I Flood-tide of the river, flow on! Clouds of the west, flash your beautiful tints on the horizon's brim! Crowds of men and women, attired in the usual costumes, curious, earnest, fiivolous, ugly, beautiful, or what not, move on, pursue your various ways, on the road, in the marts, anywhere, every- where. You are more curious and wonder- ful to me than my words can tell! I am with you-the flood-tide and the ebb-tide are taking us along,-the clouds of the west and the east are lending their tints to each complexion--the impalpable sustenance from all things bearing us up all hours of the day lending their aid to the simple, com- pact, well-joined scheme -each person and particle disintegrated, yet a part of the glorious whole-the similitudes of the past and those of the future-the glories strung together like beads on my sight and hearing, on my intellectual and spiritual memories, from my walks in the streets, in the woods, over the earth! The current rushes swiftly,   WILL IT CO3IE     335 And is bearing us far away, and others are following. How fast they swim towards us! How strong and sure the lines between us! They will certainly reach this place, and as certainly pass on, as we are passing on with life, love, hope, care, sight, hearing. They will enter these gates, watch the sun half an hour high, gaze musingly on the river, longingly into the skies, sadly into the past and future! Fifty years hence, others will see, feel, enjoy, sorrow, as I am now seeing, hearing, and feeling, a hundred years, many hundred years hence! Nothing avails to hold the unfolding! - and nothing avails to hold me from  meeting you, 0 men and women-neither time nor space nor distance! I am already with you. I can almost sense your thoughts and feel your hearts beat now. You think I am under the sod or mingled with the dust. It is only the necessary film that envelopes all for a proper time, that keeps our actual faces from seeing each other, making you seem to be tn    <pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC6684-00000169"/> 336     WILL IT COME? alive to yourselves, and me not alive though I am speaking to you now! Oh, what is it that ties me to you, gen- erations unborn! But as you read the report of my words, literally born, and breathing this same air that fills my lungs, what is it that fuses me into you now-- my "now" and your "now" melted together - what is it that pours my meanings into you, and blends our heart-throbs? We understand, then, do we not? What I promised, without mentioning it, have you hot accepted? What the study could not teach, what the preaching could not accom- plish, what the science could not start, what no suggestions of history could hint, is un- bosomed, is it not? Flow on, river!-flow with your ceaseless moan, and ebb with your ceaseless moan! Frolic on, crested and leaping billows! I know what your wild waves are saying! Gor- geous clouds of sunset, glow and burn, and drench me with your splendor, and these men   WIILL IT CO E?    337 and women who are reading the words I am now uttering generations and creations after me! I read your hieroglyphic lines, and know the meanning of your flashiing splendor! Cross from shore to shore the sparkling and laugh- ing river, O men and women! How the waters splash to the prow of your leaping boat! What a meaning is in their foaming lips, what a song of the Infinite in their ut- tering tongues Stand up, O mountains in the distance, stand up, ye everlasting hills! In what awful majesty ye speak from your misty shroud! Throb on, O curious and baffled brain! stick to your questions well, and long and long: the answers will come; the eternal float of solution, suspended for a time, will blab by-and-bye. Gaze, loving and thirsting eyes in the house, street, public assembly, forests! Call aloud, or whisper on, O warm and pulsing heart! sing out the hymns of the invisible hosts of sighs and hopes and loves and fears!

Sail on, 0 divine ship over the divine sea! Iflaunt your flags of all nations invitingly into the eyes of my brothers and sisters, till they are duly lowered at sunset on the divine shore! Burn high your lights, O watchfires along the coasts! light up the night and the- storm! Cast your red and yellow flashes over the darkness and the gloom. Appearances now or henceforth indicate what you are, and what the tempests are and the waves!

AS was anticipated by many of the people in the near vicinity of the speakers' stand long before she closed her wonderful and almost unearthly effort, Letitia Percival was borne in a swoon from the platform to the residence of her uncle, immediately on the utterance of the sentence just recorded. She was accompanied to her home by John Franklin Kingman, who remained with her till she breathed her last in the arms of her cousin, Elsie Estelle Aidens. A letter from Kingman, received shortly after the press had been teeming with the funeral obsequies of this beautiful and gifted being, relates the particulars of her death, and gives the finale to the story of their early and unfortunate love. I select from the letter only what I    <pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC6684-00000172"/> 342     WILL IT COME P think will be of immediate and personal interest to the reader:  "Letitia lay upon a couch fronting the window, her luminous eyes fixed apparently upon the sky, and, holding her small and attenuated hand in mine, I gazed upon her face with that mixture of sorrow and tender- ness which is perhaps the most exquisite of all the shades of feeling wherewith love blesses and exalts the heart; for now that she was so soon to be the bride of Death, I could love her wholly, unreservedly, fondly as I did ere the shadows fell and night came on. Presently, Letitia slightly shuddered, and turning her face to me, said slowly and sol- emnly, and in a whisper, - "Frank, it is - going on -four years- is it not- since we-" "Speak not of it Letitia!"I exclaimed in horror, " speak not of it!" "I must, Frank, I must. Yet you see, it kills me to do it."   WILL IT COME?     343 t And me! Think you I do not suffer?" "Alas I from that fatal time, have I ever once alluded to it? and yet it has been eating here, HERE, Frank, till it has destroyed me. Do not weep, sir, do not weep!. the tears are stealing through your fingers fast; and I know that your tears fall not easily. I too have wept, Frank; but my tears were all inward." "I weep not for myself Letitia, I never have; but for thee, oh, for thee, how have I poured them in torrents, as though my very life were a sea, all to be shed in burning drops and sear my cheeks like molten lead, for thee, my lost, my unforgotten! and now, just as your soul is ,all shriven, and your well-won fame on every tongue, in every heart, you are going!" In my agony I hid my face in her lap and felt her hand gently laid upon my head, and heard her breath expire heavily and as in pain. "I oppress you?"I said, anxiously, and    <pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC6684-00000173"/> 344     WTILL IT COME? recovered myself instantly. "Very little." With an anguish I call never describe, I saw that I had over-agitated her enfeebled frame, and was saying as to myself, and under my breath, "My God, my God!" when she whispered, oh, so faintly "Hush!" and look- ing upward as though she saw some pleasing  scene, added, "Do not speak now." Her hand lay motionless in mine, and cold as death. I thought too that there was an alteration in her looks: the skin beneath her eyes becoming strangely dark, and the color changing on her lips to purple. I was alarmed. "You do not feel worse, love?"I inquired, refraining painfully from express- ing all the anxiety I felt. "No, not worse: better. A little numb- ness; but that will soon pass." Even while she spoke, the strange discoloration seemed to change into a halo, like a cloud into a rainbow, and her lips resumed a healthier hue. She spoke slowly, faintly, and inter- ruptedly.   WILL IT COE?      345. "Only sit thus and hold my hand. I shall be better soon. Do you think I have a soul, soul as you understand it, as you taught it to me in the long ago, Frank? I love to look upon that beautiful sky, and dream that I am happy. Have you any messages to send with me up over the starry bridges?" "Oh, yes," I said, almost sobbed, on her gentle ear; "say that I am coming soon. Elzie and I are almost on the wing. You will meet us in the way?" -"In the way - in theway!" she repeated softly; and then suddenly her eyes flashed, and with a faint scream, half-springing from the couch, she exclaimed, grasping my arm, "Look! look! they have come, they have come! they have brought it!" I turned, as if shot. At that instant Letitia's hand relaxed its feeble pressure. I heard her gasp convulsively, and faintly, almost indistinctly, whisper at intervals, "Will - it - come? I've - so -long- asked - and -waited - and- now   it 15*    <pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC6684-00000174"/> 346    TWILL IT COME? is-here." I felt her weight more heavy on my arm. I turned to her eyes. They were fixed upon the ceiling in glazed rigidity, but smiling still. Letitia, Letitia I "I heard Elzie wildly calling to her. "Speak to me! Oh, speak to me! Look on me, Tishey! Only look once more!" The eyes moved not; the lips replied not, nor returned the kisses showered upon them. With a deep, deep groan, Elzie fell prostrate and senseless across the body as it dropped from my relaxed and icy hands. And they laid some buds upon her brow. They crossed her little hands. She looked so meek and fair. Death's bride arrayed in flowers. And thus, thus - 'twas the seventh day, or the eighth--perhaps not so much; but it was somewhere about that time after we had laid the beautiful casket away among the flowers. No one was in the room besides myself but Elzie,- Elzie, my angel - Leti-   WILL IT COME?      347 tia's angel; Letitia loved her; and who does not love her? She is so kind-oh, she is made up of gentleness and affection. And she looks it all. I think no one can be with her much and not love her. Light of step, soft of voice, gentle of manner; and when she sings, it brings the tears into your eyes, and when she smiles it makes you think of heaven, - you can't help it. "Will it come?" said the beautiful girl, and yet not so much said as dreamily, musi- cally fluttered through her rosy lips, as though it were whispered through  that pearly gateway by the invisibles. "Will what come, my pet?"I almost as dreamily inquired. "The crown: such as she wore, and of which she taught me so much - the spiritual crown which encircled .her beautiful and triumphant head on that great day--the crown of triumph over earth--over life over death itself? O Mr. Kingman, my. own precious love,--loved as man is seldom    <pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC6684-00000175"/> 348     WILL IT CO1ME? loved -adored with every faculty of this wild being--every pulse of this throbbing heart--will you, can you teach this weak, erring, impulsive child of yours to conquer as you have taulght--nay, nay, deny it not; she told me all- and I was so glad - it almost made me worship you: will you not teach me to be - to " "To be- to be," I interrupted; "to be Mrs. John Franklin Kiingman?" "Will it come, then- will it come?- the BEING, and not the seeming- the SOUL -the citow - the TIUMPH? "We will try, Elzie." And so- It is now Mr. and Mrs. Kingman. Will you come soon to see us, my friend? Till then, believe me, Yours, FRANK.   CHAPTER   XXI. T4AD   one of that order of angels to whom a knowledge of the future, or the seraphic penetration into the hidden heart of man, is forbidden, stayed his wihgs over the lovely spot in which this chapter opens, no spectacle might have seemed to him more appropriate to it, or more elevated in the character of its tenderness above the fierce and short-lived passions of the ordi- nary world, than the love that was so sud- denly, unexpectedly, singularly, cemented, married as by a voice out of heaven, as already described in the close of the sixteenth chapter of this book. There was only one thing wanting to complete this strangest scene that ever opened on the gaze of heaven, to perfect its truth, sincerity, nature, and spiritualize it into the beauty of holi-    <pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC6684-00000176"/> 350     T'ILL IT COME? ness; and almost as if the heavens literal- ly opened, while yet we knelt,--with our hands clasped in each other's,-that want was supplied. "Lessie!" exclaimed Nowell, springing to his feet. "Lessie!"I repeated, also rising with the same celerity; and my gentle sister was folded almost in the same instant to our hearts. It was a delicious day, about the middle of June; softly warm and mildly lustrous, the finest weather of the year. The air seemed to have a fragrance and a rosy color where the sun shone, that render one, when the heart is free, so happy to merely look upon it or to breathe it; while the small birds which like to make their haunts near man, disporting in the tepid light, strained their little throats in pure delight of excited animal spirits, emulous in joy and pleasingly inharmonious. Gentlest she was of gentle maidens, my   WILL IT COME?     351 fair sister-gentle as these young birds, and mildly beautiful and sunny, like the June weather, and she seemed to dance in with the one, and her voice was as the music of the other. Disengaging herself from our embraces, she threw back her veil that she might look on us more fully, and ex- claimed, "Why! lwhat means this? Are you indeed all wild?" and her soft blue eyes wandered uneasily, inquiringly, over the strange scene. A deep blush mantled the beautiful face of Jessie. Her tearful eyes fell. She trembled. She gathered her long hair in her slender hands and held it like a veil to her face. "My brother?" inquired Lessie. I un- derstood her. For a moment I clasped her again to my breast in silence. The foun- tains of my heart were all unsealed; but they were too full that my emotions should find vent in words. Then I lifted up my voice and said, "Oh, if heaven do look down upon its children to bless them,"- and here    <pb n="352-353" xml:id="VAC6684-00000177"/> 352     WILL IT CO1ME I took Ellery's hand and placed it in Lessie's, -" may its choicest favors now rest upon the spiritual union I hereby in its name conse- crate to the subjugation of every sinful thought, every impure desire, and the tri- umph of the higher nature to the blessed- ness of worship, and the growth into His perfect likeness and obedience to his perfect will." Amen!" said Ellery, solemnly, deliber- ately, with his large eagle eyes wet as with the dews of Hermon, and lifted as in prayer. What a world of emotions seemed struggling to escape my sister's lips! She opened them to speak, but they only trembled with great leep sighs; and bursting into tears she drooped on the neck of Jessie, and the twain seemed like twin angels who had just alighted on earth to teach us the love that is felt in heaven. "Will it come?"Will it come - this love that is not of the earth, that is not in the loins, that does not burn to dust and ashes   WILL IT COME?     353 the Godlike powers of man, the angel na- ture of woman? Will it come - this higher life of soul, so beautifully inauguated by the gentle Jesus in the home of Mary and Martha, this life of beauty for ever and ever hinted in the dreams of life's young morning, in the spells of heaven that baptize the boy and girl of every blood, and everywhere, with living souls, and transform the earth from a background of animal existence into a temple of worship, full of the beauty of the Lord God, and redolent with his praise? "Will it come"  the blessed time when woman in her stainless down of soul shall realize the bright ideals that haunt her virgin heart, -of an altar, built by, cemented with, and pure and eternal as, the love that dwells in the bosom of the Father; and a shrine whose incense shall only fill, whose light shall only illuminate, whose fire shall only warm, the temple, to the inspiration of its worshippers, and the crowning of its devo- tees to the life eternal! Will it come? "I    <pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC6684-00000178"/> 354      WILL IT COIE? Whoever estimates aright? O brothers, look ye higher! Above the clouds there still is light, And in the flint's heart, fire! And though our hopes, like falling stars, Go down in night and sadness, The dawn shall open golden bars And light each soul to gladness. See from that old decaying tree The youth and beauty blooming! How many eyes can only see The discord and the dooming! And yet whence comes the golden grain P Whence all the fruits so precious? O brothers, look and think again,- E'en filth and carrion bless us! See yon vile slanderer whispering low His lies against our "standing: " O fool! how little doth he know That all his treacherous branding Is only flint against the steel To wake the fire that slumbers, And make our easy spirits feel That too much good encumbers.   ITILL IT COIE?     355 And this false one, in whom we've placed Our very soul for keeping, In proving mean and Janus-faced, Has roused us from our sleeping, And so no longer we will lean, But trust as we discover, Believing no one wholly mean, And no one good all over. The man who steals our purse or wealth, Takes not away our treaszre: Truth, conscience, honor, love, and health, Heaped up in scripture measure, Are often the result of loss Of that for which we've striven; And thus it is that every cross Becomes the key of heaven;     </p>
