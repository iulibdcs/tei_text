                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>ALL the reasons which have induced the compiler to publish this work, at the
                     present time, cannot now be given. The reader will perceive many as he
                     advances, and they will be better understood at its close.</p>
                  <p>The undertaking is considered by her to be bold and hazardous—in consideration
                     of her inexperience as a writer.</p>
                  <p>Unwilling to place any one in an unhappy attitude with others, she has not
                     consented to submit the work to a revisor, whose better judgment would prevent
                     many inaccuracies and oversights in the style, and nature of the subjects
                     introduced, from becoming so apparent as they inevitably will, in consequence
                     of relying altogether upon her own knowledge and understanding.</p>
                  <p>The RELIGIOUS parts of journals and letters, have been much abridged, because
                     not interesting to the general reader, and only so much retained as is thought
                     sufficient to present the story in its true light.</p>
                  <p>Scenes, and language of a revolting character, must sometimes be presented; and
                     the indulgence of the public is most earnestly entreated, while the compiler
                     shall endeavor to do this with as little shock as possible to the finer
                     sensibilities of the heart.</p>
                  <p>For the most part, the manuscripts are presented in their original form; the
                     compiler considering that the involuntary expressions of the mind will better
                     denote its nature, than those highly cultivated passages, which <choice>
                        <sic>loose</sic>
                        <corr>lose</corr>
                     </choice> all their native beauty by the labor with which they are brought
                     forth—and herself being solely responsible for what may here appear, she allows
                     this the more readily. "Silver and gold I have none; but such as I have I give
                     unto thee."</p>

                     <p>ON the subject of this publication, Miss Rover, in a note to a friend, dated
                        June 13th, '54, after referring to some insults and opposition to which she
                        had lately been subjected, and had given the names of the authors, &amp;c.,
                        &amp;c., all of which will be considered in their proper place, says:</p>
                     <p>"It appears very evident that the work of which I once spoke to you, should
                        be published in Oregon. * * * My conscience asserts most positively and
                        approvingly, that, in all my dreadful trials, I have endeavored to perform
                        my duty, faithfully and perseveringly, to my God, my husband, my neighbor,
                        and myself—burying within my own bosom the injustice and injuries which have
                        been done me; and there the remembrance of them would have remained had my
                        enemies been content to have suffered me to pursue my course in peace. But
                        'tis in vain that I attempt any innocent employment, whether it be intended
                        for recreation or to obtain a livelihood. The young of my classes are
                        withdrawn, when a slander reaches them, for fear of contamination; I am
                        avoided, and shunned, and slighted, and regarded with suspicions in every
                        place, till my life is more burdensome than death would be. I have,
                        therefore, in this conclusion, been impelled by a sense of justice due to
                        myself and a wish that my future life should not be overshadowed by the
                        gloom of the present."</p>
                     <p>Ruth's parents, when they commenced life together in 1794, were poor and
                        unpretending. Unlike each other in mental capacities and inclinations, they
                        nevertheless endured the marriage yoke together for a term of fifty years,
                        when it was dissolved by the hand of death. The father, an industrious,
                        upright citizen, inherited the respect of all who knew him. Not highly
                        educated himself, he thought a common school system of education sufficient
                        for his children, and anything beyond this, rank extravagance. Good trades,
                        good habits, and good homes for his boys, was all he asked to make them
                        respectable in life; while the daughters were submitted solely to the
                        management of the mother, with, however, the caution often presented for her
                        not to indulge their wish for finery. The mother was, in appearance, when a
                        girl, one of those old-fashioned bonny lasses from the State of Maine—buxom,
                        blithe and worthy. She spun and wove all her own household linen before her
                        marriage—knit thirteen pairs of stockings during the evenings her lover
                        passed with her. She instructed her daughters in the same useful arts, as
                        well as how to prepare a good meal for the family or for friends, to set and
                        keep the house in order, and to attire themselves in such apparel as was
                        becoming, neat, suitable to their station, and could be afforded by their
                        parents, or obtained by their own industry.</p>
                     <p>Ruth was the youngest of these genuine country girls. Of her childhood we
                        cannot speak much. She undoubtedly did<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC5702-00000004"
                        /> many "cunning tricks" in learning to live—as all children are supposed to
                        do until a younger one supplants them in the place of pet, when
                           <emph>their</emph> very witty capers are forgotten in the zeal to
                        proclaim those of the new comer. It has, however, been told me of Ruth that
                        she was excessively fond of her books—that when she commenced the reading of
                        a story it was in vain to expect her to cease until she had finished it—that
                        the kind of punishment inflicted by the mother, for errors, was to keep her
                        from school, and to promise her some additional privileges of that kind for
                        rewards of good behavior.</p>
                     <p>She says: "My childhood was not vicious, nor particularly religious. My
                        mother, however, was a pious woman, and early instilled into my mind the
                        fear and love of God. She taught me to pray and early explained to me good
                        books, particularly the bible. It was on an occasion like this that I
                        acquired through her a confidence in God which has been the leading star of
                        my existence. Having read and explained to me the nature of the passage
                        which says, 'enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut the door, pray
                        to thy Father who is in secret, and thy Father who seeth in secret, himself
                        shall reward thee openly,' I retired to a dark closet which I had never
                        before dared to enter alone, and having closed the door, I besought God to
                        hear and bless me. My fears of darkness vanished—I believed he had heard my
                        requests, and I found myself joyful in the thought that in my life I should
                        always be protected by the great God who had shown himself so ready to
                        listen to my simple prayers.</p>
                     <p>"In subsequent times of danger from <choice>
                           <sic>huricanes</sic>
                           <corr>hurricanes</corr>
                        </choice>, to which the place was subject, I always retired to my closet and
                        with much confidence asked my Heavenly Father to quell the tempest and
                        preserve us from harm. And I have many times since been ashamed of a lack of
                        faith when in trying circumstances, on remembering the delightful emotions
                        excited within my mind by this early exercise of faith and hope.</p>
                     <p>"My first attempt at poetry was made at three years of age, before I knew
                        the meaning of words. But selecting those which sounded alike I placed them
                        at the ends of the lines, and getting an elder schoolmate to write for me, I
                        concluded that I should at last have seat in the temple of Fame for this
                        great production. So much was I ridiculed by my brothers and sisters for
                        this, that I resolved that whatever else I might attempt, I would never
                        again try to make rhyme; and I had adhered to this resolution most strictly
                        till one day, in after years, I found I had addressed a letter in my
                        imagination to a beloved sister, in rhyme, which I found as difficult to
                        reduce to prose as to cultivate into poetry, and I suffered it to go with
                        all its errors."</p>
                     <p>Another anecdote of the childhood of Ruth will be given, inasmuch as she,
                        with her characteristic superstition, always regarded it as prophetic.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Rover had had a new bowling alley erected at the hotel where they
                        resided, and when completed it was decided by the workmen that Ruth, being
                        the pet of the family, should roll the first ball. She was carried out and
                        placed at the head of the alley, and the ball laid upon her arms. At the
                        given signal she let it drop upon the floor, when it rolled its slow course
                        along towards the pins, and entering among them threw some down, and they
                        falling on others threw them also down till every one had fallen and the
                        ball remained in their midst, when the company loudly cheered the
                        unpretending child and told her she had accomplished what no other person of
                        the number could have done.</p>

                     <p>RUTH ROVER evidently possessed a belief in the manifestation of the
                        Providence of God, as well in the trifling as the most important affairs of
                        human life—hence she frequently derived much comfort as well as instruction
                        from the appropriateness of many texts of scripture to her peculiar
                        situations, as also from scraps of reading from other sources; and although
                        she sometimes feared she was merely superstitious, yet she had the example
                        of many others, one of which will be given:</p>
                     <p>"The leaf of a folio bible, burned on the four edges, was last night
                        conveyed from a fire in Brighton street to the chamber of a physician who
                        keeps a private hospital in Howard street, Boston. The leaf was carried by
                        the wind a distance of half a mile and taken into a chamber window which was
                        open. On it was found written:</p>
                     <p>"Honor a physician with the honor due unto him—for the uses which ye may
                        have of him; for the Lord hath created him.</p>
                     <p>"For of the Most High cometh healing, and he shall receive honor of the
                        king.</p>
                     <p>"The skill of the physician shall lift up his head, and in the sight of
                        great men he shall be in admiration."</p>
                     <p>Another coincidence is found in the fact that the day before the funeral of
                        a stranger, who died in the house, took place. The 16th and 17th verses of
                        the same chapter read as follows:</p>
                     <p>"My son, let tears fall down over the dead and begin to lament as if thou
                        hadst suffered great harm thyself; and then cover his body according to the
                        custom, and neglect not his burial.</p>
                     <p>"Weep bitterly and make great moan, and use lamentation as he is worthy, and
                        that a day or two, lest thou be evil spoken; and then comfort thyself in thy
                        heaviness."</p>
                     <p>We have no superstitious inferences to draw from this event. The
                        circumstances as we have detailed them, are all facts. It is one of those
                        remarkable coincidences which sometimes occur in the particular providence
                        of God, which according to the doctrine of chances could not be calculated
                        upon in one of many millions of cases. It is more remarkable, even, than the
                        incident which occurred at the great fire in New York, some years since,
                        respecting the Methodist book establishment and the leaf containing the
                        verse, "Our holy and beautiful house is burned," &amp;c., which was conveyed
                        to Long Island."—<title>Zion's Herald.</title>

                     <p>As it is premised that Miss Rover's mind might have received some
                        inharmonious tone from the remembrance of disappointed love, to which she
                        was early subjected, we will allude to the subject here.</p>
                     <p>Some may affirm that the affections can be engaged but once in a life-time,
                        but we aver to the contrary. None was ever more ardent, more pure, or more
                        woman-like than that which occupied the heart of Ruth at three different
                        times before she took up her residence in Oregon, and from which she
                        resolutely called off her thoughts when she had discovered they were ill
                        placed. She had arrived at her seventeenth year before she had met any
                        person who had awakened in her mind any stronger sentiments of regard than
                        her school-mates, till she met in company young student, son of a physician
                        in —, Mass. They each became attached to the other at first sight—the
                        acquaintance was continued, and marriage<pb n="8-9"
                           xml:id="VAC5702-00000005"/> was proposed—when Ruth learned that a friend
                        of hers, a very excellent young lady, was devotedly attached to him, and
                        moreover, that he had sworn to marry no other but her, and whom he had
                        ceased to visit on account of some slight misunderstanding. Ruth visited her
                        and found these facts confirmed, and assuring her that she should forever
                        decline his addresses thereafter, left the town.</p>
                     <p>'Tis useless to attempt to portray the sorrows of mind which ensued. With
                        that one loved image before her mind by night and day—worthy, yet offered in
                        sacrifice—she passed dreary months of grief uncomplainingly, sustained by
                        the consciousness that she was doing right—even <emph>as</emph> she "would
                        be done by"—till she made a new acquaintance with a teacher in W.
                        Academy.</p>
                     <p>This gentleman was a candidate for the ministry of the M. E. church. His
                        attentions were rendered the more agreeable to Ruth from the circumstance of
                        the disappointment she had lately endured—and which also caused her to be
                        wary in arriving hastily to any conclusions in relation to a union. In her
                        own words we will cite the event:</p>
                     <p>"In a few weeks I discovered that there were in the academy others who
                        entertained towards Mr. — attachments corresponding with my own, and that he
                        was equally studious, on his part, to encourage them. This was as a death
                        blow to me. I at once detested his deceit and avoided his society. He
                        suspected the cause, and instead of coming to an explanation, as a man of
                        honor would have done, he pursued his course with increased ardor, as he
                        perceived it to give me pain. My situation by some may be imagined, but can
                        never be described. As a proof that my mind was painfully affected, I need
                        only to add that my days and nights were mostly spent in excessively
                        weeping, and in extreme agony of mind.</p>
                     <p>"During this state of feeling, I was obliged to attend to my studies—keep up
                        good appearances—be regular in my attendance at school—and wear a smile on
                        my countenance when my heart was wrung with grief. Yet, notwithstanding all
                        my endeavors to conceal my anguish, I was suspected, though the cause was
                        unknown. Some attributed my sadness to a melancholy turn of mind; some to
                        sullenness; and others to a carelessness of obligation toward those who had
                        placed me at school free of expense. I did not cherish his memory with
                        pleasure—and I can think of him now only as of a grave with a poison flag
                        growing above it and s contaminating the air with its noxious breath."</p>
                     <p>She continues: "I loved again, and with all the ardor of the first love, a
                        gentleman of Boston, of exemplary and ardent piety, and glowing and pure
                        affections. I resigned him, to become a missionary, believing that whatever
                        appeared in opposition to duty should be sacrificed, though dear as a right
                        hand, or the apple of an eye."</p>
                     <p>As time bears us onward toward our grave, how is its gloom lightened by the
                        belief that we shall meet such kindred spirits again, where duty can demand
                        no sacrifice, but where love—holy and eternal as the source from whence it
                        came—will exist, free from all the admixtures of evil, which despoil its
                        beauty here.</p>

                        occur hereafter.</p>

                     <head type="sub">CONVERSION.</head>
                     <p>NOR is the objection to a person's keeping a daily record of God's dealings
                        with his own soul, after the manner of Lady Maxwell and others, founded on
                        the fact that his religious experience is not as rich and diversified as
                        theirs, of any serious weight, since, in most cases is not desirable that
                        such memoranda should be published during the person's life-time; and the
                        opinion of those who survive him may be very different from his on this, as
                        well as many other points. Nor do we think that a person's proper character,
                        as it will appear in the day of judgment, is to be determined by the
                        feelings of the present moment, or the transient experience of some gracious
                        visitation of divine mercy, or the heart-cheering hopes of future good,
                        which he may at times indulge; for though we are unquestionably pleasing or
                        displeasing to God every moment, yet the general character is not to be
                        determined by the conduct of the moment. The present is a state of warfare,
                        in which the christian is the subject of "fightings without and fears
                        within," of occasional victories and incidental defeats. He is the subject
                        of storms as well as calms, of temptations from Satan, as well as of divine
                        succors from the Father of mercies. We consider therefore that a man is not
                        to be judged so much by the temper, words, and action of any given moment,
                        as by the steady purpose of the soul, the undeviating course of conduct amid
                        all the varieties of life.</p>
                     <p>FROM AN OLD JOURNAL:</p>
                     <p>"The fourth day of August, in the year 1829, I humbly trust the Lord forgave
                        my sins, while at a camp-meeting in Eastham, Cape Cod. I had felt the need
                        of religion or some years, and many times had the prayers of the people of
                        God been offered in my behalf. But foolishly believing that I could do
                        nothing toward my own conversion, I there rested, supposing that God in his
                        own good time would convert my soul without any of my exertions. But in this
                        idea I found I was mistaken, and that if I would enter into the straight
                        gate I must '<emph>strive.</emph>' With this conviction I resolved that
                        there should, no longer, be anything wanting on my part. With these feelings
                        I left my employment and went to camp meeting, and the result proved that
                        the Lord had been always ready, and the delay had been occasioned by
                        myself."</p>
                     <p>"Twenty-one years have elapsed since that event and I can never forget the
                        kindness and assistance I received from my friends in Saugus. Their
                        instructions and prayers removed my fears and strengthened my hopes, and so
                        enlightened my mind with regard to my duty that but for them, I often
                        consider, I might never have known the advantages and delights of being a
                        child of God."</p>
                     <p>"The first night we were on the campground, at a prayer meeting, the Lord
                        appeared and blessed me. I felt the burden of sin removed, but not till the
                        next morning did I feel a bright evidence that they had indeed been
                        forgiven. O! what joy did I find pervade my breast when, on awaking, I heard
                        the saints—some singing, some praying—while all the wood echoed with the
                        songs of the redeemed! I was at first surprised at my new feelings. How it
                        was that everything seemed so delightful, I could not tell. No unholy
                        thoughts—no disquietude, sorrow, or uneasiness—but peace, love and joy at
                        the sound of God's worship, which I never knew before, while all within me
                        was calm and serene as heaven. But when I<pb n="10-11"
                           xml:id="VAC5702-00000006"/> remembered the evening before I had supposed
                        I had been converted, an ecstacy of joy filled my heart. I thought the
                        evidence I enjoyed that this was genuine was as good as I could desire, and
                        the reflection that now I could be remembered with the people of God and
                        with them go to Heaven, inspired me with great happiness."</p>
                     <p>"I cannot help mentioning here the indebtedness I felt and continue to feel
                        to that holy man of God, Rev. A. D. Merrill. I surely may consider him my
                        spiritual father. He seeing my tears in the afternoon, conversed with me,
                        and learning the state of my mind, invited me to rise for prayers, telling
                        me, on witnessing my emotions, that I was "not far from the kingdom," and
                        during his prayer the Lord blessed me. Elder Hyde, long since gone to
                        Heaven, preached in the tent that afternoon, it being rainy, from the words,
                        "Sanctify yourselves to day, for to-morrow the Lord will do wonders among
                        you." God did not wait for the morrow, but even then He was in our
                        midst."</p>
                     <p>"The 20th of September I was baptised by immersion and joined the Methodist
                        Episcopal church in <choice>
                           <sic>Sargus</sic>

                        </choice>, then under the pastoral care of Rev. E. K. Avery. I soon lost the
                        bright evidence I at first received, by seeing others, when first meeting a
                        change of heart, in a far more rapturous frame of mind than I had been, and
                        indulging the suggestion that I could not have been converted or I should
                        have been exercised like them. By giving place to this doubt I lost my
                        happiness and did not for a year regain it.</p>
                     <p>"Burdened and sick and faint, to thee, O! God, I come. To whom else shall I
                        go, for thou alone hast the words of eternal life. Weary almost of
                        life—tired of sin—cast down with sorrows, and buffeted by satan—oh! what a
                        suppliant! Can I expect mercy at thy hand? Can a God so supremely glorious
                        for a moment regard me? Can I come to Jesus all guilty as I am and cast my
                        burden on him? Will he receive me? Did he ever—or was it all delusion? Was I
                        tempted to believe I had found him when indeed I had not? My soul is
                        struggling to know—I cannot rest short of a brighter evidence! Oh! God,

                        accordance with God's most holy will. I have seen a peculiar beauty this
                        morning in reading Paul's Second Epistle to the Corinthians—of dying to the
                        world daily that we may grow in grace. For the light of affliction which is
                        but for a moment, worketh for us a far more and exceeding and eternal weight
                        of glory." The rich reward we shall have, if we are faithful in the
                        discharge of earthly duty, is worth more to the <unclear>immortal
                           soul</unclear> than any sacrifice we can make for
                           <unclear>here.</unclear>
                     </p>
                     <p>"How soon, my soul, must I lament your stupidity. When shall <unclear>I
                           feel</unclear> the worth of immortal souls to lie near my heart? Every
                        day I see some new instances of mortality. The bell that now tolls, reminds
                        me that we are mortal. Yesterday the awful news of a young man but nineteen
                        years of age condemned to die upon the gallows, reached my ears; and shall
                        satan and sin abound, and christians not use every effort to convince
                        sinners of the errors of their ways?</p>
                     <p>"To the believer, Christ is precious, and to me he would be were I not so
                        unbelieving. Faith is required of the sinner, but my faith is weak and
                        wavering. Do I not see enough of the Lord's goodness every day and hour to
                        swell my heart with gratitude and love? Has not my Saviour suffered enough
                        of want and calumny umny for guilty me? Has he not from my earliest
                        childhood, been trying to win my affections to himself, and if I have in any
                        measure given him my heart, has it not been with dreadful reluctance to give
                        him my whole heart? O! my dear Jesus, come and possess my whole regards, and
                        let me be altogether thine own.</p>
                     <p>"Another week is gone, and what new scenes have I passed though? I have
                        witnessed a new instance of mortality: a man in the full bloom of health and
                        strength cut down like the flower of the field. I saw him at night when fell
                        disease had seized his vitals, restless throw his limbs from side to
                        side—again at morn I heard the death-like groan—I saw his sunken
                        countenance—I heard his dying gasp and saw his eyes closed forever. And all
                        this without an interest in Christ! He had always been a great opposer to
                        religion—he doubtless thought (like many) that old age or a dying day would
                        be time enough to think of these things—but of these privileges he was
                        deprived. Dying as he did at the early age of thirty-three, and without his
                        senses during his illness, gave no time or ability to attend to the concerns
                        of his soul, and thus, without hope of a saving change, he was launched into
                        a boundless eternity. Have I learned, by this dispensation of God's
                        providence, to seek the Lord in my youthful days, before the evil days come,
                        and the danger of procrastinating the day of repentance? Surely I have seen
                        this man die without hope, and shall I not learn from this never to despise
                        the religion of Jesus or be ashamed of his cause?</p>
                     <p>"O! thou vain world, where are thy boasted charms that millions sacrifice
                        their all, their everything, all to enjoy? What hast thou so attracting?
                        What are thy riches?—what thy honors? Riches but take to themselves wings
                        and fly away—honor is but a bubble, and friendship but a name—"a shade that
                        follows wealth and fame"—and love is still an emptier sound. How friendly
                        will your gay votaries be to the rich, while the humble poor, though
                        possessed of heavenly riches, yet, if they have not what you
                        esteem—wealth—from them you will turn away in disdain. With the pious poet,
                        I exclaim: <q>
                           <p>"O! tell me no more of this world's vain store!"</p>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>"By my own foolishness, this morning I am deprived of going to church, and,
                        O! my wicked heart, how much must I suffer from you? How long, because your
                        carnal nature is not subdued, must I be led captive at satan's will? How
                        long shall I feel the corruptions of human nature springing up within you?
                        When shall I be renewed in the spirit of mind, so that every desire of my
                        soul will be drawn out after the Lord. I have of late more than ever felt an
                        awful influence from my foes within. My pride has led me to be vain—to speak
                        vain words and to think vain thoughts, which should be placed on God alone.
                        The fear of man has kept me from doing my duty—and unbelief has kept me from
                        the throne of grace. O! cursed roots of inbred sin, how long will ye thus
                        torment me?</p>
                     <p>"This day I have been favored with hearing an instructive discourse on the
                        words, "Grow in Grace." I would now ask myself: Have I the evidence that a
                        growth in grace has been carried on in my heart?—have I grown in humility—in
                        love to the church of Christ?—and is my conscience tender, so that I cannot
                        sin without reproach? Is it my desire to be given entirely up to God? Do I
                        hate the world, or still cling to its vanities? These are important
                        questions and yet I lack in many points. <q>

                        table without remembering Him in the garden in agony, and pour out my soul
                        in grief that I have ever sinned against Him. I should remember Him on the

                        sinfulness; in healing my back-slidings, and in His long continued
                        forbearance and tender mercy towards me. O! that I might never again forget
                        my Lord and what He has done for me, but in all my ways remember His life

                     <p>About this time Ruth received a proposal for marriage from a pious man in —,
                        Mass, and, thinking fit to decline the offer, wrote him thus:</p>
                     <p>"DEAR BROTHER IN CHRIST:— * * * I am sensible that there are relations in
                        life which are tender and endearing; and when ordered by God and enjoying
                        His smile must be increasingly so. I can conceive of no greater happiness,
                        in earthly relations, than for two to be united whose hopes and joys and
                        aims are one, and they both united to Christ the Living Head. I could ask no
                        greater joy, in married state, than to be united to a man who was
                        consecrated to God, and whose greatest object was to promote His glory. I
                        should think myself greatly blessed in having a friend like this to lead me
                        on in the way to heaven; but, brother, I have learned to cease to look for
                        bliss to the transitory joys of time. I have seen the frailty of earthly
                        hopes; and in a great degree my affections are weaned from earth, and I can
                        with composure look up to my Heavenly Father and say: <q>
                           <lg type="stanza">

                              <l>Though joys be withered all, and dead—</l>

                              <l>On this my steadfast soul relies:</l>

                     </p>
                     <p>"I think that a married state entered into without suitable attachment and a
                        proper sense of duty, would prove miserable, and should be discountenanced
                        by every professor of religion. I have, therefore resolved to wait the
                        approbation of heaven, before I take a step which involves my well-being
                        through life. R. R."</p>
                     <p>It appears that while the writer of these extracts was closing, resolutely,
                        her ears to every enticement of an earthly nature, she was not left without
                        the cheering influences of the spirit of the Most High—for we find in her
                        journals and diaries many passages like the following:</p>
                     <p>"The Lord is precious to my soul—blessed be His holy name. After church
                        meeting I retired by myself for prayer, and the Lord was with me. I don't
                        know that I ever before had such access to God. It seemed as though He
                        unfolded anew His glories to me, and I saw such a fulness of love and such a
                        willingness to bestow, that at once was silenced all objections to the
                        doctrine of full sanctification."</p>
                     <p>These relations are unimportant only as denoting the operations of the
                        spirit of grace upon the mind of Ruth previous to her resigning all her
                        worldly hopes for the cause of Christ in a foreign land. Notes of her "every
                        day walk" for a year, is nearly all omitted; and many religious letters
                        omitted at this time. In all these are discovered the same struggling to
                        overcome sin, and be conformed entirely the will of God, as is felt by every
                        christian, especially when he first commences the divine life.</p>
                     <p>"Much troubled in consequence of worldly disappointments, I have for some
                        time held an idol in my heart; though in God no sin perhaps, yet it has much
                        interrupted my happiness in God. Endeavored to order my mind aright. Find
                        imperfection mixed with all my ways. Am truly wretched and undone without
                        Christ. I am willing to resign all my hopes of happiness in the world for
                        the pure religion of Jesus Christ. It is my prayer that God will divest me
                        of everything that hinders my growing in grace, and make me a humble
                        christian.</p>
                     <p>"This evening has been glorious. After a day of great trial, a few sisters
                        met for prayer, and the Saviour came also, according to his promise. I was
                        able to rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory. My faith was great—I
                        could fully believe that Jesus was my friend. After walking a short distance
                        and conversing about religion; it seemed as if the heavens were opened and
                        my soul drank deep into the love of God. O what mercy and goodness thus to
                        favor me by dispelling my doubts and fears! Can I cease to love and bless

                        blesses, but in all places He can meet with His children and fill their
                        hearts with His love. O! how many times, while there in my walks and secret
                        retirements, have I shouted glory to God and joyed in His divine favor.
                        Bless the Lord! O! my soul! O! how exultingly do I love the Lord, my maker!
                        I will glory in His presence, and praise Him for His love.</p>
                     <p>"Since my return to Boston I have been favored with much of the joys of the
                        christian. Last Sabbath was a precious season, and I have been since
                        panting, for my God and desiring to be like Him in holiness and love. Dear
                        Saviour, make me all thine own.</p>
                     <p>"I commence again to record my trials for surely they are great and
                        numerous. I sometimes believe I shall sink under them, and I find my mind so
                        excited that I fear reason will leave me; I too keenly perceive the errors
                        of others, viz: those of ministers and church members, the glaring
                        wickedness of the world around me, and my own constant failings and
                        imperfections wound me and destroy peace. My wandering affections—coldness
                        in duty—want of confidence—unbelief and ignorance—and want of courage, and
                        the fear of man, all tend to harrow up my feelings and make me exclaim—ah!
                        me!—"From the crown of my to the soles of my feet I am full of wounds and
                        bruises and putrefying sores." And yet, in all this, I forget that Jesus'<pb
                           n="14-15" xml:id="VAC5702-00000008"/> blood can heal my wounds, and that
                        thro' him I am saved. Oh! what a mercy that I am spared still.</p>
                     <p>"God is my refuge in distress, a present help in time of trouble." Never did
                        I so fully realize the truth of these words as I have of late. For a short
                        time I have been in — and I find not that height of holiness in the church I
                        could wish to see. Many of the professed followers of the Lord have become
                        lovers of pleasure more than God—saints, are sleeping—sinners are dying all
                        around us. A plague is spreading through the land hurrying millions to
                        eternity without time for repentance. O! I could weep that Zion has no more
                        friends—that my God has no more worshippers—that former children are
                        becoming indifferent to his service. Some of my dearest friends, whom I
                        fancied almost unchangeable in their devotion to the Lord's cause, have
                        become reversed. But why do I mourn? God is my refuge, and what a blessed
                        nearness do I feel towards Him. When every other source of comfort fails, re
                        seems but little distance between Him and my soul, so sweetly does he cheer
                        my heart and bid me look forward to my happy home in heaven. O! my God! my
                           <emph>Father!</emph>—by what nearer title can I address thee? Thou art my
                        friend and deliverer—I give my all to thee and I beseech thee to keep me
                        from every evil.</p>
                     <p>This is a period when every child of should be alive to the performance
                        their duty. That dreadful disease the cholera, has, within the last year,
                        swept unprepared beings into eternity, is fast approaching us. Already has
                        it commenced its work of death on our continent, and who can tell who shall
                        be its next victim? I have been asking myself if I were resigned to die, and
                        have been able to say—I am. Never was I so completely weaned from earth as
                        now—I not one tie to bind me here—all are severed. All earthly hopes are
                        fading transitory. "There's nothing here deserves my joys—there's nothing
                        like my God. No—how gladly would I leave earth to be refreshed with heavenly
                        bliss. 'Tis He that makes my paradise; and where He is 'tis heaven."</p>

                     <p>"MUCH disturbed in mind of late from various causes. This world is not my
                        home—I am more than ever weaned from it. For these ten years I have looked
                        to it for happiness, but all in vain. It has ever happened that those
                        objects on which I have placed my fondest hopes have been taken from me, and
                        those plans which I have laid out for myself and thought unalterable, have
                        worked in a way contrary to my desires; but I will not murmur—'tis
                        undoubtedly all for the best. "God moves in a mysterious way, His wonders to
                        perform " I find so great a sense of some weakness resting upon me that I
                        can never ask mercy at the hand of God, for I deserve no favors. I would
                        rather die and leave the world than to live for nothing but myself.</p>
                     <p>"I have at last resolved to attempt to prepare myself for a teacher to the
                        heathen, by working diligently for two years, that I may be able to defray
                        the expense of going to school to review my studies for this purpose. My
                        father is able to do this for me, but being opposed to my plan, he will not.
                        He said to me, not long since, "My daughter, I have raised nine children;
                        they have all left me and settled elsewhere but you and Isaac. I have worked
                        hard for many years to provide for them, and I think out of them all I have
                        a right to claim <emph>one</emph>, at least, to live with me as long as I
                        live, and <emph>you</emph>, being the last, and at present free to choose, I
                        have determined to claim your services during my old age, and when I am dead
                        you will be released and can take any course which will best suit you." I
                        replied, "Father, I could not do anything gratifying to my feelings—'tis
                        just what I wish to do—to live with you as as you live." He seemed greatly
                        pleased and satisfied, and has many times reminded me of this duty which I
                        had promised—and when I have asked for money to go to school, that I might
                        be qualified for a missionary teacher, he has so utterly opposed to the idea
                        that he has never consented to furnish me a cent. My mind has become much
                        interested for the heathen and I have been able to find peace only in
                        resolving to go and teach them, should an opportunity present itself. But I
                        am not qualified without better learning, and I must make some endeavor to
                        obtain it. My father never felt the importance, as some, of giving his
                        children a good education, and many times has my mother taken me from school
                        for punishment for errors I have committed—it being the greatest punishment
                        she could inflict on me, and, when threatened, was always sufficient to
                        ensure to her any amount of obedience might require. Hence, if I would
                        succeed in my favorite plan, I must work and obtain means of my own to
                        enable me to do so, that my life may be spent in some useful way, and that I
                        may be the instrument of doing some good in the cause of Christ. I would
                        like to obey my father, but if a higher authority calls me elsewhere, I must
                        regard it with the greatest preference. I was led to shed tear of joy this
                        evening on reading my portion of "Daily Food" for this day. It was so
                        encouraging that I will set it down at length. "They that sow in tears shall
                        reap in joy." <q>

                        servant, enter into the joys of thy Lord."</p>
                     <p>"Heard to-day of the death of Dr. Albert Orne. He was a young man of
                        uncommon promise who for some years has labored assiduously, alternately
                        teaching and studying, to obtain a collegiate education. He had injured his
                        health, and now his life has paid the forfeit. He died at one of the West
                        India Islands, alone, unattended and <choice>
                           <sic>unconssoled</sic>
                           <corr>unconsoled</corr>
                        </choice> by friends. Yet he died in hope to rise again in the resurrection
                        of the just.</p>
                     <p>"For two weeks my mind has been troubled in view of my unfaithfulness and
                        weakness, but the Lord did appear for me to day. As I was going to prayer he
                        removed the burden of unbelief I have for so long felt, and I would now
                        rejoice in God. I love the Lord, and I realize much pleasure when I remember
                        that I have given myself up to Him while I live. I thank God that He ever
                        called after me while in sin and caused me to love His word. It gives me
                        unspeakable happiness to believe He is my father and friend, and I am His
                        child and servant.</p>
                     <p>"I have been at home eight weeks and enjoyed the blessings of life and the
                        society of friends, yet for the most time my mind has been oppressed and ill
                        at ease. To-morrow, if the Lord will, I intend going to B—— to work for
                        means to enable me to go to school. 'Tis hard for me to disappoint my
                        father, but I hope he will live yet many years and I may have the privilege
                        of being with him at the last.</p>
                     <p>"Let all that is within me praise and bless the name of the Lord. Since I
                        came to this place I have enjoyed an unusual sense of the favor of God. All
                        things have been caused to work together for good. What reason have I to
                        rejoice that I was ever drawn to seek and serve the Lord, and to give myself
                        entirely to him. I have felt that all my concerns were known to God, and, as
                        Mrs. Fletcher says, "In all my ways Thy hand I own, Thy ruling Providence I
                        see." Yes, my God, Thou knowest all things—Thou knowest that my being in
                        this place is intended for Thy glory, and if it be not agreeable to Thy will
                        why should I have Thy presence? Why should I rest with so much confidence on
                        Thee? Why should I enjoy such peace of mind? Why should I now, while I
                        write, shout glory to Thy name?—and why should I, in the toil of day, when I
                        reflect that I work for Thee, feel all pain removed and pursue my task with
                        pleasure? Thou hast been with me since I came, and directed events for my
                        good. O! continue thy goodness, indulgent parent, and fill my heart with
                        gratitude and my mouth with praise.</p>
                     <p>"My soul, break out in praise and never cease thy grateful song. The Lord is
                        mine and I am His! Should a voice from heaven speak this sentence I could
                        not believe it more fully than I now do. Every day confirms me in this faith
                        and gives me increasing cause for gratitude. I have the presence of God with
                        me and I feel His love. I rely on Him, and all things are ordered aright. I
                        trust in Him, and he does all things for me that is best. I love Thee, O!
                        Lord, and I trust with all my heart. If anything on earth has more of my
                        love than Thee, O! take it from me, and <emph>Thyself</emph> possess the
                        whole of my affections. I give up all to Thee—my life—my time—my property—my
                        soul and body, I give to Thee. Use them for Thy glory and the good of Thy
                        cause.</p>
                     <p>"Last week was a week of favors from the Lord. I enjoyed his presence by
                        night and by day. I thought I could never again indulge in doubt of my
                        acceptance. This week my faith has been put to the test; my mind being
                        beclouded I have not found the same freedom in prayer, yet my faith has not
                        failed. I have been enabled to trust in the Lord though the appearance of
                        his immediate presence has vanished. 'Tis blessed thus to feel in every time
                        of cloud as well as sunshine.</p>
                     <p>"I will now record the goodness of the Lord. Formerly I have written much of
                        my trials and little enjoyment, but now I will speak of rejoicing and faith.
                        From all indications I can discover, 'tis right for me to continue to work,
                        and by-and-by the door will be opened for usefulness. Yesterday and to-day I
                        have felt a full confidence in God, believing that I am owned and taken care
                        of by Him. In all my ways His arm has been underneath me, and, though
                        invisible, He has been and is doing all for me I need, and clearing the way
                        before me."</p>
                     <p>During a few weeks Ruth Rover devoted herself enthusiastically to the object
                        she had resolved to accomplish, viz: to educate herself for a missionary
                        teacher; but a fit of sickness made it necessary for her to return to her
                        friends. We find, by her journal of this time, that her mind became much
                        depressed in consequence. She says:</p>
                     <p>"I know not whether to attribute this to unbelief, or to having taken a
                        wrong course; I verily thought I did right, and was many times greatly
                        blessed in the reflection that I labored for God, and sometimes He seemed so
                        near me that I had only to whisper my wishes to Him and they were gratified.
                        But now it seems that all communications with Him are cut off and I hardly
                        dare to pray, and I often come from the throne of grace unblest. What can
                        the hindrance be?"</p>
                     <p>When her health returned she consented to take a school and remain with her
                        sister in G—; but still fearing she had done wrong, she says:</p>
                     <p>"Since writing the last time I have had many trials and dark moments; but
                        now I perceive the Lord has led me by a way I knew not; He has made the
                        darkness to give light, and the path of sorrow steps to glory; His right
                        hand has upheld me amid thousands of snares, and when I fancied myself alone
                        and exposed to the devices of satan, He was with me and kept me from harm. I
                        bless Thee, thou God who hast made me, for Thy mercies fail not. I love Thee
                        and will praise Thee while I live, when I die, and through eternity.</p>
                     <p>"A few days since I was brought to have a very humbling view of myself; my
                        weaknesses and sins seemed all arrayed before me—and then came the question,
                        can you <emph>thus</emph>, with all your vileness, cast yourself on Jesus?
                        It seemed a wicked thought at first to suppose He would receive me, but at
                        an evening meeting I beheld such a fulness in Him that I was able to cast
                        myself upon His mercy, all sinful as I was, and believe He received me.</p>
                     <p>"I was also, when in that low state of mind, asked by some spiritual
                        enquirer, 'you have always been willing to be something—are you now willing
                        to be nothing?' I had placed such strong hopes on being a missionary, and
                        had anticipated so much pleasure therein, that the idea of resigning this
                        hope was very painful; but, considering the poor state of my health—my
                        inability to perform any good work—my poverty and ignorance, I was induced
                        to conclude that I must be willing to be <emph>nothing</emph>. I however
                        felt that if it were God's will it should be so, I should be happy in
                        submitting to His chastisement. I have a strong desire that, whether living
                        or dying, sick or well, I may be entirely the Lord's.</p>
                     <p>"How singular are the events of my life! I verily feel as though I stand on
                        holy ground. I know not which way to move for fear of moving in the wrong
                        way. I know not what God has in store for me—whether joy or grief; my mind
                        has been <emph>exceedingly</emph> disturbed. I have covenanted to live for
                        God, and have many times said I was determined to live not for myself but
                        for the cause of God alone. At present I see no way to live more devoted
                        than in the common duties of life, but these do not content me. My
                        disposition seeks to bear some nobler part in life than the mere rounds of
                        domestic duty; I may glorify God in these I know, but with all their
                        pleasures they do not appear so inviting to me as a cross-bearing and
                        self-denying life.</p>
                     <p>"While in G—, I consented to receive the addresses of Mr. D. O., a member of
                        the Baptist church in that place. Considering that there was no longer any
                        probability of my going to the heathen, I did this the more willingly. I
                           never<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC5702-00000010"/> engaged to marry him. And
                        now I find I must part with him. As he is a man differing in many points of
                        doctrine from myself, I think we should not live in perfect harmony together
                        and be of one heart, as married persons should be; and I feel the importance
                        of this the more as I have often resolved to devote my life to the Lord, and
                        I have therefore no desire nor intention to marry until by so doing I may
                        aid the cause of religion more than by remaining single.</p>
                     <p>"My mind is still cast down. I pray—I agonize—but still something rests upon
                        it which I cannot describe. My spirit groaneth within me as I go about my
                        work; my mind is restless and I do not find peace. It really appears to me
                        that God is preparing some event for me which now I do not understand. I
                        have met so many disappointments as to cause me to be weaned from earth. I
                        think I can never enjoy a <emph>married</emph> life, except it be where
                        holiness and devotedness to the cause of Christ are united. Perhaps I am
                        wrong and take erroneous views, but I have prayed that if I am deceived the
                        Lord will undeceive me. I want very much to know the will of God concerning
                        me, and I think I can never rest contented till I do. My case is, I think,
                        singular. I know of no christian that ever felt as I do. I am sensible that
                        some unseen hand is leading and directing the events of my life, and shall I
                        not be grateful that I am so much regarded as to be led on, even through
                        affliction, for some wise purpose? I will be thankful and bless God that he
                        afflicts me and deigns ever to notice me.</p>
                     <p>"I have this day parted with my dear friend D. O., and to me, at least, it
                        was a <emph>painful</emph> parting. I am sensible that I loved him, and were
                        I content to settle here I think I should give my hand to him. We have
                           <emph>parted</emph> and I hardly realize it. Have I so willingly given up
                        a friend I love? and am I again in this drear world alone, without the
                        reflection that there is one who will interest himself for me? Yes, so it
                        is, and I almost fear to form new acquaintances for fear of new sorrows. And
                        am I right thus to disappoint a man who had placed his hopes on me and given
                        me many assurances of his love? I cannot tell, for at present my mind is
                        dark concerning a knowledge of the will of God. But I have resolved that if
                        an opportunity presents itself for me to go to the heathen I shall go. "Thy
                        will be done"—this comprehends all. I dread nothing more than for God to
                        change his purposes concerning me, to gratify my wish. I know if He rules
                        over me and directs the concerns of my life, I need not fear. Let me but be
                        sensible it is He and I am blessed in every event—if <emph>scourged</emph>,
                        let me but see my Father's hand and I bear it with pleasure.</p>
                     <p>"'God moves in a mysterious way, His wonders to perform,' I am often led to
                        exclaim. Surely I am the Lord's in a peculiar sense—or not His at all. If
                        some divine power has not influenced me for three years last past never was
                        mortal more deceived. I find that it is in vain that I devise plans for my
                        own gratification and enjoyment, they are often thwarted and I left to
                        acquiesce in the command, 'Be still and know that I am God.' There is a
                        prospect of my going to Africa as a teacher. If such be God's will, I trust
                        the duty will become yet more evident. Should I be called upon, I shall
                        leave all and go.</p>
                     <p>"A noble resolution has been passed by the members of conference in favor of
                        the missionary cause—perhaps a better could not have been suggested. A
                        society has been organised, to be called the 'Missionary Education Society
                        of the M. E. Church,' for the purpose of educating teachers of both sexes,
                        who are unqualified, yet are willing to devote themselves to the work of
                        missions. I believe there are in the churches many young females who are
                        desirous to sacrifice every earthly object to become teachers in heathen
                        lands, but for a want of suitable learning and friends to assist them, are
                        kept back. This society is a remedy.</p>
                     <p>"Last Thursday I offered myself to brother Lindsay, one of the executive
                        committee of the missionary education society, as a missionary teacher. He
                        said he considered me a suitable person to be devoted to this work, and as
                        soon as he could see the agent he would make my case known. I rejoice that
                        the prospect is brightening. My greatest desire is, and has been for years,
                        to become a missionary. I care not where I am sent, let me but go where God
                        would have me. The ties of nature and affection encircle around my heart at
                        the thought of separation arises; but for <emph>this</emph> cause I can
                        break through them all. I know not of one person or interest in all the
                        earth that I would relinquish the life of the missionary to enjoy. O! may
                        God accept me—may the missionary society accept me—and may I be a missionary
                        and win souls to Christ."</p>
                     <p>Ruth having received sufficient encouragement from Mr. Lindsay, of the
                        missionary society, to lead her to presume she would be a recipient of its
                        bounty, visited her father to acquaint him with her resolution.</p>
                     <p>He, as usual, disapproved of it, and told her that by the time she had been
                        to school a year she would have given up the idea. Next morning being New
                        Year's day, the younger members of the family got their bibles and opening
                        them. said. they were going to see what was coming to pass in the future,
                        for 'twas said that whatever was opened to on New Year's morning always was
                        fulfilled. Ruth did not feel much interested in their fortunes, but was
                        somewhat surprised at what seemed to be indicated for her, as she, in
                        compliance with their request, opened the bible. Her eyes rested upon the
                        first chapter of Jeremiah, and she read it aloud.</p>
                     <p>Her thoughts were particularly interested in these words:</p>
                     <p>"Then said I, ah! Lord God, behold I cannot speak, for I am but a child.</p>
                     <p>"But the Lord said unto me, say not 'I am a child,' for thou shalt go to all
                        that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak.</p>
                     <p>"Be not afraid of their faces, for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the
                        Lord.</p>
                     <p>"Thou, therefore, gird up thy loins, and arise and speak unto them all that
                        I command thee; be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before
                        them. And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against
                        thee; for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee."</p>
                     <p>She was much inclined to think 'twas all a whim and that she had done wrong
                        in so far yielding to a wish to comprehend the future, when she considered
                        the verse which said:</p>
                     <p>
                        <emph>"And they shall fight against thee," &amp;c.</emph>
                     </p>
                     <p>She thought that at any rate <emph>this</emph> could never be fulfilled on
                        missionary ground, where brethren dwell together in such unity, the service
                        of God being the paramount business of <choice>
                           <sic>ther</sic>
                           <corr>their</corr>
                        </choice> lives. How true that she was <emph>then</emph> only a child in
                        knowledge. Her mind became overcast with fear, which was, however, somewhat
                        lessened when considering that which was added in the same verse, "but they
                        shall not prevail against thee, for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith
                        the Lord," and she concluded that if the first applied to her; the last
                        might also be claimed as applicable to herself.</p>
                     <p>On recurring to her father, she perceived he was very sad, and from this
                        time his manner towards her was changed.</p>
                     <p>She endeavored to draw him into conversation on the subject, but he was not
                        inclined to converse and would only say:</p>
                     <p>"If you persist in this ridiculous resolution, I shall disinherit you. By
                        hard work I have saved a little to leave to my children, and they'll soon
                        obtain it; but, Ruth, if I should die to-morrow, and you be gone from me, I
                        shall give you nothing only what the law allows, which is one dollar, and,
                        furthermore, if you go out of the country on this missionary business, you
                        need never write to me, for I'll not answer you a syllable."</p>
                     <p>Ruth could only weep and tell him she hoped he would live many years, and
                        that if she joined the missionary society she should engage herself only for
                        a term of six years, and then she would return and devote her entire self to
                        him for the remainder of his days.</p>
                     <p>"And they'll be short," he added, "long before the six years are ended I
                        shall be sleeping in the ground."</p>
                     <p>There is a zeal which is not according to knowledge, and Ruth Rover appeared
                        to have imbibed some of it. 'Tis said, in<pb n="20-21"
                           xml:id="VAC5702-00000011"/> the good book, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy
                        God with all thy heart," and in the same book is also written, "Children
                        obey your parents in the Lord."</p>
                     <p>One duty never conflicts with another; but Ruth, in her lack of experience,
                        considered herself justified in disobeying her father in this instance, by
                        the words which say, "He that loveth father or mother more than me is not
                        worthy of me." She loved her father, but believed she loved her God more,
                        and for the sacrifice she was making she comforted herself by reading:</p>
                     <p>"There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father,
                        or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake and the gospel's, but
                        he shall receive an hundred-fold now, in this time, houses, and brethren,
                        and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in
                        the world to come eternal life."</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Rover regarded this subject in a very different light from her husband.
                        She felt that she belonged to the <emph>world,</emph> and that
                           <emph>this</emph> life, with all its flickerings made and vanities, was
                        but the prelude to one that was eternal, and whether spent in sorrow or joy
                        it was soon past; and hence she thought that the best way to spend it was in
                        a preparation for that which was to come, and consequently told her daughter
                        to decide on this subject as was most in accordance with her own conscience,
                        and the obedience which she considered due to Him who had the best claims to
                        her services.</p>
                     <p>We find a few items more in the journal on this subject, and again refer to
                        it:</p>
                     <p>"Some time after the above date I called again on brother Lindsay to learn
                        the result of his interview with the agent of the Methodist Episcopal
                        Society in my behalf. He informed me that the "committee" could not be
                        assembled on business till the day which had been appointed for their
                        regular meeting, but he said he was so well acquainted with me, with my
                        family and standing in the church, he was willing to receive me as a
                        recipient of the benefits of the education society, on his own
                        responsibility, and he believed the "committee" would approve his choice. He
                        accordingly gave me a letter of introduction to the Principal of Wilbraham
                        Academy, stating to him that I was to enter that academy on the foundation
                        of the Missionary Education Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church in
                        Boston. I have, accordingly, this day come to Wilbraham with a view to being
                        educated as a teacher to the heathen.</p>
                     <p>"Two years ago I went to B— with a view to obtain means to educate myself,
                        but the Lord saw fit to frustrate that design, <emph>and now, in the same
                           time that I expected to come here at my own expense, the Lord has sent me
                           and inclined his people to furnish me with the means.</emph>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is like our God. His wisdom exceeds our own, and His truth and
                        faithfulness never fail. It is my intention to be diligent and make all the
                        improvement I can, and studiously to strive to have my deportment such that
                        my friends of the education society may never regret having made me a
                        recipient of their bounty.</p>
                     <p>"Still in Wilbraham, and if I have not made great proficiency in natural
                        science, I have made some in moral; and what I have learned of my own heart
                        has nearly discouraged me. I find my mind weak and easily effected, and I
                        have suffered, extremely with temptation and disappointment. But hitherto
                        the Lord has helped me, and I discover much wisdom in the arraignment of
                        providence, and my regret that I have not been more submissive and relied
                        with more confidence on God. This summer I was absent from school nearly
                        three months. I labored during that time all that was possible to obtain
                        means to replenish my wardrobe and supply myself with books,—but with the
                        greatest economy in dress I was not able to obtain books. I made my case
                        known to two of the executive committee and they kindly interested
                        themselves for me and presented me with eight dollars and twenty cents,
                        obtained by a collection taken up for that purpose, at a prayer meeting in
                        Boston. I was also favored with a short interview with brother —, who said
                        he would esteem it a privilege to correspond with me and occasionally to
                        assist me with money. Thus could I see the hand of a benevolent, heavenly
                        parent, supplying all my wants and delivering me from all my perplexities.
                        When at home my father treated me with a coldness bordering on severity, and
                        neither assisted me to any favor or made me welcome to my board; although my
                        mother refused any compensation, I could not but think that my absence would
                        be more acceptable. My sisters were kind, but they so much disapproved of
                        the course I had taken that I did not well enjoy their society. I have left
                        my home feeling much <unclear>as though</unclear> I had
                           <unclear>none</unclear> and my friends as though they were
                           <unclear>enemies</unclear>. <unclear>This, in</unclear> a measure
                        depresses my spirits, but I have an evidence, within that God, the mighty
                        God, is my friend, and is and has been doing for my comfort and happiness
                        all that is necessary. He has raised up for me many valuable friends in the
                        Methodist parish for which I am grateful."</p>

                                       <salute>"DEAR SISTER RUTH:</salute>
                                    </opener>
                                    <p>Although we have been separated nearly seventeen years, I
                                       have not, I believe, held the least intercourse or
                                       correspondence by letter with you during the whole period.
                                       You must not for a moment presume that a lack of brotherly
                                       affection for you has been the cause of my not writing to you
                                       particularly, as well as to some of my other sister but
                                       believe me when I tell you I am incapable of expressing the
                                       regard and interest I feel for your prosperity and happiness,
                                       and that my negligence was owing altogether to other
                                       causes.</p>
                                    <p>"I hope, dear sister, since I have concluded to write, that
                                       provided I should differ from you a little in some matters,
                                       and say somethings rather cross-grained before I close, you
                                       will have the goodness to impute it rather to my ignorance of
                                       the matter than to a wish to cause you any unpleasant
                                       feelings.</p>
                                    <p>"About ten days ago I received a letter from sister Vonsar
                                       replete with tenderness and affection. After sympathising and
                                       condoling with me for the loss of my wife and child, she
                                       informs me of the warm reception and kind offices I may
                                       expect from my friends in Massachusetts when I return, and
                                       then concludes by saying: "Our dear sister Ruth has gone to
                                       Wilbraham to prepare herself to go as a teacher among the
                                       Indians." Now this is very grievous—news that I was by no
                                       means prepared to hear. My dear sister, if the above is a
                                       fact, I beg of you in the name of all you hold dear, be
                                       prevailed upon to relinquish the desperate resolution; a
                                       resolution which if persisted in will, I fear, bring more
                                       sighing and sorrowing upon your relations than if they had
                                       followed you to the silent tomb. For my own part, my grief is
                                       audible! I lament bitterly to think you possess no more
                                       common sense than to be led estray like silly women, to be
                                       butchered and tomahawked by the relentless and savage
                                       Indians. You very well know, my dear sister, that ever since
                                       I have lived in this country there has been a continual and
                                       unceasing supplication for me to return, now, to gratify you
                                       all, after an absence of so many years, I will inform you
                                       that I have sold my houses, my lots, my almost everything,
                                       for the sole purpose of returning and spending my remaining
                                       days with you. If your resolution to go is so firmly fixed
                                       that you cannot be deterred from it, I insist upon it that
                                       you postpone your departure until <unclear>my return.
                                          I</unclear> must confess that my <unclear>knowledge of
                                          these</unclear> missions to the Indians is
                                          <unclear>somewhat limited</unclear>, but from what I
                                          <emph>do</emph> know, I <unclear>am</unclear> irresistibly
                                       led to the conclusion that <unclear>they are</unclear>
                                       altogether uncalled for, and are useless squandering and
                                       waste of life and treasure; and further, I believe that none
                                       but over zealous, enthusiastic fanatics engage in them. You
                                       must not blame me for talking plainly—the occasion is one of
                                       importance and demands it. Do, I pray you, revolve these
                                       things in your mind and reflect well before it is too late to
                                       retrace your steps, and write me immediately your
                                       determination on the subject. I shall not rest till I hear
                                       from you. My dear little Mary and Harriet burst into a flood
                                       of tears when I read their aunt's letter to them, would
                                       scarcely believe you had not already gone.</p>

                                    <p>"Mary writes that father is in a very bad state of health and
                                       probably will not live long. I do hope and pray that I may
                                       see him again in this world; it would be extremely painful to
                                       return and find him laid in the dust, and you in a situation
                                       more to be deplored.</p>
                                    <p>"Let me repeat that I shall expect to hear from you by
                                       Christmas or New Year at the farthest, and in the meantime I
                                       shall fervently pray that your thoughts on this mission to
                                       the Indians will be entirely changed.</p>

                     <p>"The one great purpose of her heart, however, from which it seems nothing

                        first piece of composition she offered the grammar class for correction. We
                        believe it is her final attempt at blank verse, and is introduced not

                                       <hi rend="i"/>My Dear Sister—It is with no small degree of
                                       emotion that I address you on this occasion. I cannot let you
                                       go to your home without again expressing my regards for you
                                       and asking a continuance of your friendship. By the order of
                                       providence we have met and formed an acquaintance and have
                                       passed a few fleeting hours together, and now you are called
                                       to leave me. Must it be so? Can I now give you the parting
                                       hand? I had anticipated spending much more time in your
                                       society but now I am compelled to say <hi rend="i"/>farewell.
                                       Would that it could be otherwise! Already does the big tear
                                       struggle for release from my eye, in anticipation of the
                                       unwelcome scene which I must witness. I have many times
                                       called to part with friends <unclear>near and dear</unclear>,
                                       but I think I have never felt <unclear>more keen</unclear>
                                       regret on any former occasion. The pure feelings of
                                       friendship I entertain for you, and the prospect you have
                                       before you, together with the probability that we part to
                                       meet no more, are sufficient to render our parting truly
                                       painful. But I would not enhance your unpleasant feelings. I
                                       believe your heart is already surcharged with sorrow. I know
                                       that you feel much, and feel <emph>deeply</emph>, therefore I
                                       would endeavor to lighten your burden and soothe your
                                       sorrows. Yes, my dear Ruth, you have <emph>one</emph> friend
                                       who feels for you, and, though you leave me, I trust we shall
                                       often think of each other, and that with no small degree of
                                       emotion.</p>
                                    <p>"Who can know what changes a few short years may make?
                                          <emph>You</emph> are probably destined to some far, far
                                       distant land, and I, <emph>where?</emph> Alas! me—perhaps
                                       while <emph>you</emph> are employing all your talents in
                                       teaching the unenlightened savage, your friend C. will be
                                       sleeping beneath the clods of yonder valley. These are solemn
                                       yet pleasing considerations. How exulting the thought that we
                                       shall ere long have done with all the things of earth and
                                       ended all our trials here.</p>

                                          <unclear>world for</unclear> happiness—teach him that
                                       there are substantial joys in

                                       undertaking. May you be successful, and finally, should we
                                       meet no more on earth, may we meet in that better land where
                                       parting will be no more. May heaven make me <unclear>worthy
                                          to</unclear> meet you there.</p>

                     <p>After spending something more than a year at Wilbraham Academy. Ruth Rover
                        was much pleased when she was informed by the principal that it was Mr.
                        Lindsay's opinion she could leave the school, and though there was not then
                        a prospect of an immediate call being made for a teacher in any foreign
                        mission under their control, yet, by holding herself in readiness, she
                        should be considered the first on the list, and meantime she was at liberty
                        to pursue her own calling, and recommended to take a school if it were
                        possible, thereby the better to progress in the improvement of her own
                        mind.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Lindsay had visited the academy and conversed with Ruth and learnt that
                        she was being subjected to severe trials. He instructed and consoled her
                        like a true servant of God, and, moreover, as a man who could appreciate her
                        feelings as she thus sacrificed all earthly considerations and prospects for
                        that course in the service of her Maker to which she gave the greatest
                        preference. On bidding her adieu he prayed most earnestly for God's blessing
                        to rest upon her, and putting his hands to her eyes told her to "keep back
                        the tears," and to "look forward to a better land."</p>
                     <p>Among the names of those persons with whom Ruth became acquainted at
                        Wilbraham and whom she speaks of with christian love and gratitude, is that
                        of Rev. Mr. Raymond, a teacher in the school. Not only (according to her
                        notes) did he ever conduct himself toward her as a true gentleman, but as a
                        man of humane and sympathetic feelings, acting on every occasion as a friend
                        and brother.</p>
                     <p>Ruth Rover passed a few months in Boston and then visited among her friends,
                        the better to withdraw her hopes from every earthly prospect of happiness,
                        which was likely to increase the regrets she felt on leaving her native
                        land. On this subject she speaks thus in her journal:</p>
                     <p>"I have thought it better to part with brother — now than at a future
                        period, after having given him encouragement by continuing to receive his
                        addresses. If I know what manner of spirit I am of, I know I love God to
                        that degree that I freely give up all for Him who died for me. Father and
                        mother are dear, but they can be surrendered to God. Friends—oh! here's the
                        trial, as in that word is included one whom I esteem the dearest among all
                        earthly friends—but if the word comes "<emph>Go!</emph>" I resign him also,
                        well knowing the time will come, if both are faithful, when we shall meet
                        again."</p>
                     <p>Some time after this we find Ruth keeping school at Nahant, Lynn. She
                        remained for one term, but so great was her impatience to be away to some
                        mission station that she could not force herself to remain any longer. The
                        school was very interesting, the schoolhouse pleasant and possessed of the
                        advantage of having a fine large library of free access to the teacher and
                        scholars. She had board in an excellent christian family, and she made some
                        acquaintances with persons of intelligence and worth, but her "mind was not
                        at rest." She ever felt that she was wasting time to be employed thus, and
                        her greatest anxiety was to be engaged among the heathen. With these
                        feelings, she felt compelled to inform the committee, at the close of the
                        term, that she must forego the pleasure of teaching the school any longer,
                        and having bidden farewell to her scholars and friends she returned to the
                        society of her sister in. Malden.</p>

                     <p>RUTH had passed but two days with her sister, when the Rev. Messrs. Pierce
                        and Leland called and informed her that an opportunity then presented itself
                        for her to become a teacher to the heathen, if such were her desire. She had
                        been a member of the church under Mr. Pierce's pastoral care, and he was
                        aware that she had been for some time most anxiously awaiting an appointment
                        to some missionary station. In her own words we can best present the
                        prospect before her:</p>
                     <p>"Mr. Leland, previously to his embarking for this mission, in view of the
                        ill health of his wife and the number of his family, made known to the board
                        his resolution to not proceed to the mission field without they would
                        provide means for him to take into his family a female domestic. They
                        consented to provide for her maintenance by sufficiently increasing his
                        salary for that purpose, and paying her passage to Oregon. He was not able
                        to obtain such a domestic during the season in which he was making
                        preparations for his departure until the time previous to that in which the
                        vessel was to sail, had expired within ten days.</p>
                     <p>"It was known that <emph>I</emph> had been for some time waiting for a
                        situation as teacher in some mission, and was recommended to him as a
                        suitable person to be so employed, provided it were agreeable to me thus to
                        go. I was interrogated on the subject and objected. It was then proposed
                        that, as there was not time to obtain an appointment for me from the board
                        at New York, I should accompany Mr. Leland without one; depending on him for
                        my support until the board should be apprised of the measure and send me an
                        appointment. To this I did not particularly object, but my friends urged the
                        propriety of a pledge being given by these ministers, under whose auspices I
                        left home, that I should be employed <emph>as a teacher</emph> in Oregon,
                        when I should have reached that country, which was given me. Mr. Leland
                        said, in presence of several gentlemen, that he did not wish or expect me to
                        serve him or his family, but he wished my company merely for the pleasure of
                        his wife, as she was not well, and might sometimes very much desire a female
                        associate. Mr. Leland also promised, before these gentlemen, that he would
                        be to me in every sense as a <emph>father,</emph> and would provide for me
                        as he would for one of his own daughters, which promise he several times
                        repeated to my brother. <q>

                     <p>The time being very short which could be employed in making preparations for
                        the voyage, her friends in Saugus, with great kindness and alacrity exerted
                        themselves selves to assist her, and assembling in the parsonage, most
                        industriously prepared for her comfort and convenience every article their
                        kindly feelings could suggest to render her comfortable at sea and for a
                        length of time after she should have arrived at her place of destination.
                        Presents were sent in by the people of the town till there was scarcely room
                        for more.</p>
                     <p>This had been the place of her birth and childhood, and where she had for
                        about ten years attended school, hence they felt, as some expressed
                        themselves, as if they were "preparing a child to leave them;" and the
                        attachment of mother, sister, and brother could not exceed that which was
                        manifested by the good people of Saugus on this occasion.</p>
                     <p>Her own sister, the Rev. Mrs. B. of Maiden, though greatly opposed to the
                        step she had taken, yet made every possible exertion for her comfort and
                        convenience. As also another sister, Mrs. H. of Saugus. Her brother, S.
                        Rover who had written her from Illinois, when she was at school in
                        Wilbraham, and who had ever been so utterly unreconciled to her becoming a
                        missionary to the Indians now devoted himself entirely to her
                        interest—procuring and preparing for her every article which others named,
                        or which his own generous thought could devise, to render her happy.</p>
                     <p>Every preparation being now made and the time nearly arrived for the
                        reinforcement to sail, Ruth endeavored to nerve her mind to bid farewell to
                        her father, by appropriating to herself every text of scripture which she
                        could consider applicable, till she considered she was well approved by
                        heaven; and this thought was sufficient to encourage and strengthen; her.
                        Weak child! how erroneous your judgment! how fatal your decision!</p>
                     <p>Right, although it might have been, for Ruth to devote herself to the work
                        of missions, yet we verily believe she was wrong in point of time. Had she
                        been content to have waited a better offering for her to go, she could have
                        devoted herself to her father's service while he lived—obtained the legacy
                        of his blessing to have cheered her own heart till she should have descended
                        to the tomb, and found <emph>but one short year taken</emph> from those
                        which she wished to have devoted exclusively to the missionary work in a
                        foreign field. And who can tell how different the course and events of her
                        life would have been? What trials might have been averted and what blessings
                        bestowed, had she, after performing her duty to her earthly parent, been
                        resigned to the disposition which her heavenly father should have made of
                        her.</p>
                     <p>She reached her father's house about midnight, accompanied by her sister and
                        brother-in-law. The old gentleman received them affectionately, complained
                        of ill health and seemed depressed in spirit. He conversed with tolerable
                        freedom till he had been informed by the brother-in-law that Ruth had come
                        home to bid him farewell, for she was to sail in a few days for Oregon. He
                        said no more to his daughter, but told Mr. B. that if she persisted, he was
                        fully determined to disinherit her and no more recognize her as his
                        child.</p>
                     <p>In the morning, when ready to leave Ruth had taken the parting hand with all
                        the family, her mother included, and approached her father. She earnestly
                        begged his forgiveness—expressed her determination to return home after six
                        years and serve him faithfully—entreated him to answer her letters—imprinted
                        many kisses upon his cheek, and left him in tears. During all this he spoke
                        not, but his feelings were betrayed by his tears which fell profusely.</p>
                     <p>Men seldom weep, and 'twere wisdom if women would weep less. Tears afford
                        relief to the o'ercharged heart—but it were better to think lightly of
                        sorrows, as they are so soon past, than to weaken the nerves by pondering
                        over them, while we cannot in this way make the number less.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Rover loved his daughter, and the keen disappointment he felt on her
                        leaving the States, together with the conviction which he seemed to carry
                        about with him that he should not live to see her return, caused this
                        weakness.</p>
                     <p>It was the expressed wish of Messrs. Pierce and Leland that Miss Rover<pb
                           n="28-29" xml:id="VAC5702-00000015"/> should not attend the farewell
                        missionary meeting in Boston, with the mission family, but, while
                           <emph>they</emph> should attend there, she, according to their request,
                        should attend a farewell meeting of a similar kind, held in Saugus. The
                        reason of this arrangement was, as one said, that Mr. Leland's family might
                        realize the advantages of the most interesting occasion without the interest
                        being divided.</p>
                     <p>When Ruth joined them in Boston she received: From the hand of Rev. N. S.
                        Spalding, $50 00; the Saugus collection by the same, $26 00; and by Rev. J.
                        C. Pierce, $24 00. The whole one hundred dollars being considered her outfit
                        for the Oregon mission.</p>
                     <p>The members of the reinforcement were now considered as <emph>one
                           family</emph>, and many presents were sent to the vessel in which they
                        were to sail, directed to "<hi rend="i"/>The Mission Family."</p>
                     <p>Her favorite sister, Mrs. B., left in her hand an affectionate letter, in
                        which she gave her some good advice. She says:</p>
                     <p>"Your friends have done much for you—O! remember 'tis all of God and be
                        determined to devote your all to Him. This is now a time of prosperity with
                        you. Don't let the enemy creep in here. Don't forget your dependance on
                        Divine grace. If you knew, like me, the danger of relying on human strength,
                        you would rely on that arm alone which can save you.</p>
                     <p>"I have been much dejected to-day in view of the trials and exposures to
                        which you will undoubtedly be subjected on your passage at sea, and when you
                        shall arrive at a foreign shore and be situated among strangers. Nothing but
                        the grace of life can sustain you in going, and us in, surrendering you for
                        this purpose. <q>
                           <lg type="stanza">
                              <l>"Go, sister, go, but with thee bear</l>
                              <l>A sister's wish, a sister's prayer."</l>
                           </lg>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The members of this reinforcement were, Rev. Mr. Leland, his wife and three
                        daughters; Rev. Mr. Perkins, and Ruth Rover. They sailed from Boston on the
                        23d of Jan. '37, in the brig Peru, Capt. Kilham, of Boston. They had also in
                        company two or three gentlemen passengers destined to the Sandwich
                        Islands.</p>
                     <p>We cannot find any record of this voyage, and presume if any were kept it is
                        with the friends of Ruth in Massachusetts. We have, however, a few letters
                        before us, written at different periods while at sea, and from which we will
                        make some extracts. The first date is:</p>
                     <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Brig Peru, Jan. 25, '37.</p>
                     <p>"BELOVED SISTER: The most keen and painful feelings I have felt at parting
                        were realized when I took the last look at Boston, when the vessel left the
                        wharf. I had left a large circle of true friends, to whom I was much
                        indebted, and whose kindness I expect to be never able to repay. The word
                        farewell, as it involuntarily fell from my lips, was accompanied with
                        indescribable emotions. My prayers for your happiness were never more urgent
                        than at that moment, and I the more earnestly besought <emph>God</emph> to
                        bless you, as I was satisfied I could never return the kind acts of your
                        love.</p>
                     <p>"I wish I was near enough to you this fine morning to converse without
                        having to wait for my pen to commit my words to paper, and then some months,
                        perhaps, before I shall receive your replies. In a ball of yarn I found,
                        to-day, a scrap of paper concealed by you, on which you had written many
                        assurances of your love to me and regrets at my leaving, &amp;c. I was much
                        gratified. What so consoling in a trying moment as the voice of friendship?
                        What so cheering in this lower world as the evidence of affection in our
                        acquaintance?</p>
                     <p>"I have, notwithstanding the disagreeableness of the weather, attended
                        considerably to reading, writing and working, and anticipate much more
                        pleasure therein, after the weather shall have become settled. I have
                        reviewed my journals and manuscripts with much satisfaction, as I see the
                        hand of God in ordering the events of my life; and I cannot repine that I
                        was disappointed in a union with those I loved; as to that disappointment. I
                        am indebted for the agreeable situation in which I am now placed."</p>
                     <p>"I take much pleasure in working for those on board who cannot use the
                        needle. I have made for the steward, cook, and waiter, each a cloth cap;
                        have made a new coat and mended old ones—and have made aprons for the
                        steward, &amp;c., &amp;c. The rest of my time I employ in working for
                        myself, reading, writing, painting drawing, studying, star-gazing, and
                        exercising on deck and in the cabin. So you see I need not be idle.
                        Sometimes I have a pleasant discussion with one or more of the passengers,
                        on different subjects, which prevents the wheels of time from always passing
                        heavily. I have other exercises, too, which are still more pleasant—I have
                        seasons of devotion, when I am peculiarly favored with the Spirit's
                        influence, and find my mind greatly invigorated by meditation on divine
                        subjects.</p>
                     <p>"This morning there were several sails in sight, and I hoped to have been
                        able to send my letters, but they have all passed without speaking us. They
                        were not very social, because, perhaps, they thought we might be too much
                        that way inclined. The shore of Brazil is so near that we can readily
                        distinguish the trees. Two fishermen on a raft passed directly by us this
                        morning. It was very reviving to see a new human countenance, after being so
                        long shut up in this small place. A curious fish, which is called the
                        nautilus, or man-of-war, is sometimes seen on the surface of the water. It
                        carries a fibrous sail, which it unfurls when it suits its convenience.</p>
                     <p>"A tremendous shower last night kept the officers and men up all night. Poor
                        fellows! how hard they have to toil who get their living on the seas. We
                        have frequently sudden tempests which continue about ten minutes, and
                        threaten to overwhelm us in the deep; but hitherto we have been preserved;
                        and are blessed with good health, good spirits, and unnumbered
                        blessings.</p>
                     <p>"Not yet any religious exercises on the Sabbath. The seamen and passengers
                        complain bitterly and say, "If these preachers cannot preach. or pray here,
                        they are not fit men to be missionaries." O! dear, 'tis hard to be an
                        occasion of reproach to the ungodly.</p>
                     <p>"We have all things in order on board, I assure you. Charley and steward
                        tend the table. which is set in style. The knives ever shining like polished
                        silver, and the spoons and castors glowing with brilliancy. Our food is well
                        prepared. and relished with smiles and compliments from the officers and
                        passengers. I often say, where now are all the kind friends I left at home?
                        and the good will, and kind heartedness, and benign affections. and peace,
                        and pleasure of all together?—where are they?—far far away! The big tear
                        will start—the heart will feel, and groan, and suffer; nor would I have it
                        otherwise. You have won my <emph>best affections,</emph> dear brother and
                        sister. You have been to me of all earthly friends <emph>the best,</emph>
                        and you have ('tis all I have to give) my unfailing friendship and my
                        constant prayers for your prosperity and happiness.</p>
                     <p>"<hi rend="i"/>March 6th. Yesterday we had religious services for the first
                        time since we have been out. Mr. Leland spoke from the words, "What is
                        truth?" The gentlemen spread an awning over the deck, to screen us from the
                        sun, and we found it very pleasant to sit thus quietly in a fine day, on the
                        smooth ocean, and listen to the words of divine truth. Let me tell you. I
                        have delightful religious exercises. I find a sweet submission of my own
                        will to the will of God. In prayer, "Thy will be done," is the sweetest
                        language I can employ to express my feelings. So judiciously has my heavenly
                        Father ordered the events of my life, and so agreeably to my best wishes
                        have they thus far terminated, that I cannot but submit all my interests to
                        his direction—and O! how I mourn that I was so repining and unbelieving in
                        those times when thick darkness covered my path.</p>
                     <p>"We are within a few miles of St. Catharine's. The view of the coast is very
                        fine indeed, and if it were not the Sabbath day I would give you a sketch of
                        it. You cannot imagine how pleasantly we pass our time. Occasional accidents
                        and exposure to dangers, cause us, when free from them, to rejoice in the
                        many mercies and favors which we receive.</p>
                     <p>"The anxieties and cares which devolve upon our captain are very great, and
                        I never knew a <emph>christian</emph> conduct himself in seasons of trial
                        with more prudence,<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC5702-00000016"/> or sustain
                        himself amidst difficulties with greater composure and fortitude than does
                        Capt. Kilham.</p>
                     <p>"Our sympathies ought to be awakened for the seamen. We should consider how
                        great are their deprivations. and exposures, and sufferings, when we are
                        comfortably situated in our happy dwellings, secure from storms and the
                        dangers of the deep.</p>
                     <p>"A squall of wind has helped us into the harbor of St. Catharine's, and we
                        have just dropped anchor. I really wish I could describe to you this
                        beautiful coast. On the mountain tops rest the clouds—their sides and the
                        valleys are admirably covered with green shrubbery and grass—and
                        occasionally appears near the water's edge, or on the mountain side, a neat
                        white cottage.</p>
                     <p>"Capt. Cathcart, said to be from Nantucket, who resides on the Brazilian
                        coast—having married a Portuguese lady—earnestly requested us of the mission
                        family to take up our residence at his house, while the brig proceeds to the
                        island to make repairs. We were most happy to accept his invitation, and are
                        now enjoying the hospitalities of this very hospitable people. Mrs. Cathcart
                        does not speak English, but renders herself very agreeable by her attentions
                        and acts of kindness to us. She will have her slaves wait upon us, taking
                        all our wardrobe to the springs in the mountains for washing, and returning
                        them beautifully fresh and clean, and refusing any compensation. Every day I
                        wander about the plantations, seeking and finding ever new delights in this
                        enchanting place. Beauty is seen everywhere and in everything. The air is
                        filled with birds of every variety of colored plumage, and with insects of
                        rich and varied lustre. Wild flowers, which no art or cultivation can
                        improve in splendor—tropical fruits in a richness and variety luxury could
                        never wish excelled—insects astonishing you with the order and occupations
                        or their lives—and, in short, every delight in scenery and production, which
                        is necessary to make the place a paradise, is here. Here are found oranges,
                        lemons and lime in great abundance—the ground literally covered with those
                        which have ripened and fallen from the trees, while <emph>on</emph> the
                        trees are seen those of all sizes, many nearly ripe, and the contrast of
                        these with the young oranges, which are always as green as the leaf, is very
                        beautiful. The blossoms, too, follow the fall of the ripe fruit almost
                        immediately, and hence, on the orange trees may be seen at all times,
                        flowers and fruit of different degrees of perfection, from the smallest to
                        the perfectly ripe. This tree knows no change of seasons. The coffee and
                        cotton plants are also novelties to me; and the pine apple I have never seen
                        growing before, and here are large fields of them, growing each upon a
                        single stalk and the apple not more than a foot from the ground. The prickly
                        pear is also a curiosity. That frightful looking plant which you cultivate
                        with so much care in your parlor window, grows here a large tree, the bulk
                        of the size of a person's waist, and is as ugly looking as anything you
                        could wish to see in nature. The fruit, however, is delicious. It grows
                        about the size of the common apple—looks as forbidding and disagreeable as
                        the tree itself, but on examining it you find it perfectly white,
                        interspersed with fine seeds,—very sweet, soft, and rich. 'Tis very hard to
                        obtain, as it grows high upon the guarded stalk, and woe be to him, who,
                        with unqualified hands, shall attempt to gain it. With much difficulty a
                        Portuguese gentleman who, with his wife, was taking me to view the shore on
                        another part of the coast, obtained one for me, and as I ate and admired its
                        delicacy and richness, I could not help expressing my astonishment at the
                        contrast between its internal excellence and outward appearance.</p>
                     <p>"I often observe, in my rambles, processions of emmets, one following
                        another, and each with a bit of orange leaf in his mouth, for a distance of
                        a quarter of a mile or more, and to which I never find the end. Spiders,
                        too, would frighten you from their size. I have seen them three or four
                        inches in length. Butterflies are numerous and of a splendor I never before
                        saw equalled. This gentleman to-day, caught one in his hat which would
                        measure, I believe, five inches between the tips of its wings, and was of a
                        rich blue color, speckled with gold. You may conceive of the beauty of the
                        smaller insects from the fact that the native women collect their wings for
                        the manufacture of wreaths to adorn their persons.</p>
                     <p>"From the feathers of birds, in the hues which nature has given them, are
                        made those fine feather flowers, of which you have seen some specimens; and
                        from <emph>sea shells,</emph> without any artificial decorations, are also
                        formed elegant boquets, one of which I send you. You will perceive that the
                        roses, buds, and other flowers, are in the natural form and color of the
                        shells, and the green leaves are fashioned from sea weed. Nature here
                        performs her own adorning and provides her own material.</p>
                     <p>"To Capt. Cathcart and family we shall ever be indebted. I did not even
                           <emph>attempt</emph> to cancel my obligations, for all I could do was to
                        offer a few presents to the slaves. We left this enchanting spot with
                        regret, although wishing to proceed on our voyage."</p>
                     <p>When approaching Valparaiso, Ruth writes to the same sister:</p>
                     <p>"How much I wish I could see you, and to you confide all my troubles. I am
                        unpleasantly situated in some respects. The many little petty annoyances
                        which one unavoidably meets on a long voyage, cannot in a small vessel be
                        shook off by an occasional visit to a friend, or a walk; or a ride, but we
                        must bear them, hoping for the time when we shall be again on terra firma
                        and free as birds. Among other disagreeables which I have to encounter, is
                        the infidel, conversation of Mr. Perkins. He ever seems to think he can
                        convince me that our faith is erroneous—that he has discovered a new and a
                        better way, and urges me to read the books which have fallen into his hands.
                        Sometimes I consent to read some passages, but this indulgence is ever
                        followed with darkness and condemnation of mind; and he is so confident of
                        his own ability to rightly appreciate the divine word, that 'tis useless for
                           <emph>me</emph> to reason with him. He says I am not "<emph>logically
                           qualified</emph> enough to contend with those who have received
                        collegiate educations!"—and I know I am not <emph>conceitedly
                           qualified</emph> enough to argue with one so superior in point of
                        intellectual acquirements and capacities. He calls himself a
                        Utilitarian.</p>
                     <p>"Our captain had been during the voyage very anxious about the event of
                        passing Cape Horn—even saying that if he were only safely past
                           <emph>it</emph> he would be happy. We did safely pass that point, and
                        attempt to run up along the coast of Patagonia. The captain was in high
                        spirits—came below and offered the passengers extra refreshments and
                        delicacies, but while partaking them a head wind met us and blew us far
                        south, where we had to remain for three weeks and endure the cold, and rain,
                        and gales, &amp;c., &amp;c., so common in those latitudes, until we thought
                        that next time, at least, we would remember our dependence till we were out
                        of danger. Besides the stormy days, the nights were rendered unpleasant and
                        sleepless by violent winds and the rolling of the vessel. With all my
                        efforts to retain my self-possession, I have sometimes become disconcerted.
                        I had flattered myself considerably in my adroitness in preparing for the
                        violent motions of the vessel, so as to preserve myself from accident, but I
                        must resign the palm to others, for I have many times had my work-basket
                        upset and all its varied contents thrown about the cabins—have found myself,
                        when dressing, thrown immediately before the open door, in view of the
                        gentlemen—have spilled my plate of soup time and time again, and been thrown
                        from the table, food in hand, against the side of the cabin, and had the
                        vexation to perceive, on recovering myself, that the captain was laughing at
                        me, &amp;c., &amp;c., till I have made up my mind that I, too, must be
                        submissive to old Neptune, and think lightly of his wayward habits."</p>

                     <p>"VALPARAISO is very singular in appearance, viewed from the harbor. Built
                        upon the side of a mountain the houses appear to be contiguous, and you
                        obtain the idea that a heavy shower of rain would wash them all into the
                        sea. They are built mostly of adobes and never of more than one story, on
                        account of the frequency of earthquakes which happen in this region. A few
                        of these are boarded in front and painted white. We took lodgings to day
                        with Mrs. W—. Mrs. Capt. Scott has just called and invited us to her house
                        to tea. There are but three American ladies resident here. Gentlemen,
                        however, from almost all parts of the world throng the place on matters of
                        business, and soldiers numbering about seventeen hundred, from the sloops of
                        war lying in the bay, added to a population of several thousand, causes no
                        small degree of bustle about the mountains. The Chilians are also making
                        preparations for war with Peru, and I can find no time for walking but early
                        in the morning. The scenery here is grand, but there is little of that
                        luxury in the productions of nature which is so manifest at St. Catharine's.
                        The mountains are almost barren of vegetation, but in a few nooks and
                        cranies of the valleys I have seen very good plants. The native women,
                        however, cultivate flowers to a great extent, in their small door-yards, and
                        many of these are of a most enchanting beauty. The different species of
                        geranium, of some tender slips of which you are so proud, grow here to
                        bushes as large as the hazel bush in Massachusetts. Indeed it is a splendid
                        plant, and seems to grow on scanty soil as well as any, and I verily believe
                        depends more on the atmosphere for its healthy and beautiful appearance than
                        on the ground.</p>
                     <p>"The natives are Spanish and Portuguese, and a more hospitable and agreeable
                        people I don't believe inhabit any part of the earth. I cannot pass these
                        little, unpretending houses, without being saluted by the ladies, invited in
                        to rest and to see the flowers, and literally burdened with boquets when I
                        leave. And when I walk on the mountains, if I meet a milk-maid who has been
                        to milk her cows, I must take a drink of milk from the pitcher. Nor is
                           <emph>money</emph> the object, for 'tis always refused when proffered. If
                        hospitable and kindly feelings render people so agreeable, let me possess
                        and cherish them as long as I live."</p>
                     <p>At Callao, Ruth did not go on shore, but of the natural productions she
                        says:</p>

                        perhaps in consequence of the deprivation I suffer in not going on shore.
                        The flowers, I think, must have come from the garden of Eden, if I am to
                        judge from their splendor and richness. The fruits are new to us and very
                        delicious. Among them are the pomegranate, cherrymoi, and fruit of the
                        passion flower. The pomegranate is the least agreeable to the taste of any
                        other."</p>

                        <head>LETTER FROM ONE OF THE MISSIONARIES.</head>
                        <p>The friends of Miss Ruth Rover, one of the missionaries who sailed from
                           this port in January, 1837, for the Oregon mission, have furnished us
                           with one of her letters recently received. The first date in the letter
                           is made at Callao Harbor bor, Peru, June 4th, and the last at the
                           Sandwich Islands, Aug., 9th.</p>
                        <p>We make some extracts from it, not because it contains any missionary
                           news, strictly speaking, but for the purpose of letting our readers into
                           the heart of a devoted missionary, while on her passage to the scene of
                           her future labors. Here they may see how grace will sustain that heart,
                           in absence from friends most dear, in fears that depress, in loneliness
                           which dejects, and in the despondency of the heart, when the sweet
                           remembrances of home press upon the heart with irresistible power:</p>
                        <p>"BELOVED BROTHER AND SISTER: I am again so situated that my thoughts are
                           irresistibly led to the society of <unclear>loved</unclear> ones in New
                           England, and <unclear>especially</unclear> that of yours. Our vessel
                              <unclear>anchored in</unclear> this harbor last Friday evening. (June
                           2d.) All our passengers have gone ashore, and the captain and first mate.
                           Brother Leland and family have gone on board the sloop Enterprise, where
                           he is to conduct divine worship. My disposition for solitude, led me to
                           prefer spending the time by myself.</p>
                        <p>"Since I have been on board, I have again commenced the reading of the
                           New Testament in course, and it never before was attended with so much
                           pleasure to my mind. I never before so viewed the Saviour in his divine
                           character. I never so loved, so adored the Son of God. Insensible and
                           undeserving as I am, and notwithstanding I have so often lost divine
                           influences by my carelessness, I am often, when reading the words of
                           Christ, nearly overpowered by a sense of the excellency and glory of his
                           character. With the bible for my treasure, I find the yoke of Christ is
                           easy, and his burden is light. My whole soul is alive to the sentiment
                           when I repeat: <q>
                              <lg type="stanza">

                                 <l>Bids my freed heart in thee rejoice."</l>

                        </p>
                        <p>"I am glad to find myself on the passage to the Sandwich Islands, for
                           which we left Callao last evening. While at that place we were requested
                           to visit the sloop-of-war North Carolina, and were much pleased with the
                           appearance of a school on board of her. There are two able teachers for
                           the instruction of sixty boys, and twenty midshipmen.</p>
                        <p>"My time at Callao passed pleasantly, except the pain I received by
                           witnessing the profligacy of some on board our vessel. One of our
                           officers lost his office by being on shore in a state of intoxication,
                           and without leave for more than forty-eight hours. Coming to bid me
                           farewell, and confessing his fault, I exhorted him to turn from his bad
                           habits and be a better and a happy man, when he, with tears of penitence
                           and sorrow, said to me: "Why have you not conversed with me on this
                           subject during the voyage? You might have saved me." Reproof coming from
                           such a wicked man, I assure you, was not very grateful to the feelings of
                           a missionary.<ref rend="super" target="#note_001" xml:id="return_001"

                           as nature could be. I enjoyed the season the better, as I was conscious

                           excessive weeping yesterday, occasioned by reminiscences of the past.
                           After my feelings had become excited, they would not leave the sweet

                        </opener>
                        <p>"MY DEAR BROTHER: We are finally settled for a short time at the Island
                           of Oahu, after having been on our passage to this place one hundred and
                           eighty-seven days. It has been to me an unusually interesting space of
                           time. Throughout our voyage I have admired the wonders of the mighty
                           ocean, as well as the beauties of the firmament above; I have adored that
                           providence which has protected and blessed me; and I have constantly
                           rejoiced at the step I have taken. Our captain, one of the most agreeable
                           men, has exceeded, in his kindness and attentions to us, our most
                           sanguine expectations; and has endeared himself to our memory in a manner
                           that can never be forgotten.</p>
                        <p>"Notwithstanding there has been so great a reformation among the native
                           population of these islands, yet the <emph>foreigners</emph> are in a
                           situation truly deplorable, and very great hostility is indulged among
                           them against all missionary operations, and indeed against every exertion
                           which individuals are making for moralizing and christianizing the human
                           family.</p>
                        <p>"This day I have been to the top of Punch Bowl Hill, which is very steep
                           and of difficult ascent. Long before I reached the top I found it quite
                           necessary to climb with my hands as well as feet. On the top are placed
                           several cannon for the defence of the island.</p>
                        <p>"Accompanied by Mr. Hall, I took a ride the other day, on horseback, to
                           what is called the Pari. It is truly a delightful and romantic spot, on
                           the opposite side of the island. I could by no means learn the height of
                           the lofty peaks, and can only say they are immensely high and were
                           doubtless formed by volcanic action, as the rocks in the vicinity have a
                           good deal the appearance of blacksmith's cinders. The summits of these
                           mountains are very fertile, being indeed about the only part of the
                           island watered by the rain of heaven. The soil of the low land is also
                           very rich, but owing to the lack of rain vegetation is generally very
                           backward. A few of the residents have succeeded very well in the
                           cultivation of plants, but they are obliged to water them daily.</p>
                        <p>"I am not pleased with the scenery of Oahu, about the town. The mountains
                           are very rugged in appearance, probably thrown up by volcanic action;
                           there is but little shrubbery apparent—a few cocoa nut trees with their
                           scarcity of foliage but render the barrenness of the place the more
                           apparent. You may walk along the dusty streets and scarcely see the
                           indications of a resident's house, the high mud walls so completely
                           screening them from view.</p>
                        <p>"The advantages of missionary effort I among these natives is, I think,
                           most apparent parent in the manner of their spending the Sabbath. Their
                           immensely large thatched church is ever well filled with attentive
                           hearers, mostly sitting upon mats on the ground, and after church they
                           are not seen strolling about the streets or heard engaged in any
                           boisterous conversation. They evidently consider the Lord's day is not
                              <emph>their</emph> day, and appear to use it as property they feared
                           to injure.</p>
                        <p>"The missionaries and many of the residents have excelled, in their
                           efforts to benefit us, beyond all our conceptions, and we
                              <emph>cannot</emph> soon forget them."</p>

                        <p>"DEAR BROTHER: Again on the water but not as pleasantly situated as when
                           on board the Peru. I fancy one will hardly ever again find so fine a
                           vessel, officers, and accommodations, as we found, who were six months
                           thus highly favored on our passage from Boston to the Sandwich Islands.
                           We are now on board the Sumatra, Capt. Duncan, in the service of the
                           Hudson Bay Company, but we are not at home. The vessel is good, but not
                           new; the sailors are brave and faithful, but they are so different from
                           Americans; the captain is very kind and attentive to our wants, but he is
                           not Capt. Kilham; my stateroom is commodious, and my bed gives me repose,
                           but it is not the after-cabin of the Peru, neither is my bed as
                           comfortable as the hard mattrass I reposed on there.</p>
                        <p>"There are with us about twenty Howaiins, destined to Oregon in the
                           service of the Hudson Bay Company. These when we have a calm, are
                           delighted with pranks in the water; jumping from the decks and yards into
                           it, disappearing for some time then rising with a shout. The females,
                           also, are quite as fearless in this element as the men.</p>
                        <p>"Messrs. Leland and Perkins have gone to Vancouver, and Mrs. Leland, the
                           daughters and myself remain on board till the vessel shall arrive there.
                           The canoe which took them up has just returned. Brother Shepherd sends me
                           a note of congratulation on my safe arrival, and remarks that the harvest
                           is truly great, but the laborers are few. Indeed, I had learned that
                           before I had proceeded thus far up the river. The degradation of the
                           females, to say nothing of the others, is sufficient to call forth the
                           deep sympathies of the sympathetic, and fire their bosoms with ardor to
                           exert every faculty in the labor of convincing them of the errors of
                           their course.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi rend="i"/>Sept. 12th. "A week last night in the river, and only half
                           way to Fort Vancouver! I assure you I am very lonely. The scenery around
                           us is grand, yet I cannot enjoy it alone. The evenings, particularly, are
                           exceedingly lovely, the banks of the river are clothed quite to the
                           water's edge with tall spruce and hemlock trees, and while we are lying
                           at anchor with the moon beaming her resplendence upon us, and the water
                           around smooth and glittering in the moonbeams, it is then I wish, as I
                           sit alone upon the deck, that my dear brother was with me, to behold and
                           enjoy these works of nature, and expatiate on the grand works of
                           creation.</p>
                        <p>"We have just passed an Indian burying ground. I beheld in it, not those
                           stately monuments to mark the place where the dead repose, which are
                           generally the pride of Europeans, but a number of canoes nearly decayed,
                           with the bodies enshrouded in the garments, and surrounded by the
                           property of the deceased. This is the most common way of disposing of the
                           dead among the Indians. Some, however, burn the body, and gather the
                           ashes, with the chattels of the dead, which seldom is much more than a
                           blanket, put them in his canoe, and place it upon an elevated part of the
                           land or the rooks, and leave it for the slow hand of time to mingle with
                           its kindred earth. I found two dead bodies at Fort George, (formerly
                           Astoria,) one upon the high land, in a canoe, the other in a coarse box
                           raised upon stakes, with a rude image of death in its front. I had the
                           audacity to take away some ornaments from it and the canoe, which I will
                           send you by and by. We receive frequent visits from the Indians as we
                           slowly pass up<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC5702-00000019"/> the river. They
                           appear perfectly friendly, often bringing us deer's and bear's meat,
                           salmon, berries, &amp;c., for which, if they receive a glass of spirits,
                           they appear to consider themselves well paid.</p>
                        <p>"I observed, at Fort George, the burying place of an European, neatly
                           enclosed with a white fence, and overgrown with tall shrubbery, through
                           which I observed a white marble monument with the following inscription:
                           "In memory of D. McTavish, Esq., aged 42, drowned in crossing this river,
                           May 22, 1814."</p>
                        <p>"The two voyages I have taken since I left home have been very different
                           from each other; the latter was like going to sea with sailors, the
                           former like spending and accomplished friends. There are indeed with us,
                           some who make low bows, and observe the ordinary forms of etiquette; but
                           the refinement of the mind is wanting, and this deficiency renders these
                           external accomplishments more odious.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi rend="i"/>Sept. 14th. "Anchored, last evening, a mile from Fort
                           Vancouver, and proceeded to the fort this morning in a canoe. Dr.
                           McLaughlin entertains us while we stay.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi rend="i"/>Sept.16th. "I was, this morning, sighing for a ride on
                           Horseback, that I might, by the exercise, overcome some of the stupid
                           feeling which for so long a time have attended me, depriving me of the
                           enjoyment attendant on a life of activity. I had not long waited for the
                           horses to be in readiness, when Bro. Shepherd requested my assistance in
                           opening the clothing for the mission, which had lately been sent them. By
                           half past one I had them all spread in the sun; in the extensive field of
                           Dr. McLaughlin, and such a display! Such a variety, tissue, and texture
                           in such a land, for such a purpose! I really gazed upon them with
                           admiration, and involuntarily exclaimed, "The desert blossoms as the
                           rose." They appeared like so many monuments rising without design to give
                           glory to God and credit to the benevolent in New England. I was
                           particularly pleased with the evidences of sound judgment displayed in
                           the choice of articles. Here were colored shirts, common factory gowns,
                           crash pants, &amp;c., coarse, strong, and cheap, precisely the right kind
                           to meet the wants of these natives. By five o'clock I had these folded
                           again, and myself in readiness for a ride, accompanied by Dr. Tolmy, the
                           resident physician at the fort. I had a very pleasant ride through the
                           praries and over the highlands, and to-night feel completely tired for
                           the first time during seven months.</p>

                           morning At 11 o'clock, and embarked on board a canoe, for the mission
                           house, in company with Mr. L— and family, and Bro. D. Lee; also had with
                           us two Indians to paddle, and a plenty of baggage to annoy us; kept upon
                           the water, in the rain, mist and dampness, until our vessel struck a
                           stump in the centre of the river, and tore away her head, when we put on
                           shore for the night, made a fire, and sought repose under the trees,
                           while the rain was descending upon us as fast as we could desire. I
                           placed myself beneath a projecting old tree, with my head on the roots
                           and my body on the mud, with no shelter but the limbs and a blanket. I
                           mistake: Bro. Lee spread an umbrella over my head when I was nearly
                           asleep, which perhaps did much towards preventing the bad consequences of
                           such exposure.</p>
                        <p>"I proceeded in the morning, and remained until one o'clock without any
                           nourishment, although the day before I had taken but one slice of bread
                           beside my breakfast, all in consequence of—mismanagement and inattention
                           to me. Took some tea and bread this afternoon at Bro. Shepherd's tent, at
                           the falls, (where he stops to take charge of goods belonging to the
                           mission, as they proceed up the river,) and received many assurances of
                           friendship from him and Bro. Lee, which tended greatly to raise my
                           spirits and console my troubled mind. After this refreshment I strayed
                           away to the falls, and finding myself too weak to walk much I reclined on
                           a log, and indulged in long and melancholy, yet gratifying reflections. I
                           there reclined my head upon my dear Redeemer's breast, and received many
                           assurances of love and consolation from heaven, saying, "Fear not for I
                           am with you."</p>

                           finally, but had fifteen miles to ride on horseback. After travelling,
                           partly in darkness and partly by moonlight, over and through almost every
                           variety of rough and level country, joined our friends at half past
                           twelve on the mission ground in the Oregon Territory. I partook of the
                           supper kindly provided for us; and not caring much to converse, I amused
                           myself by observing the pleasure others enjoyed in reading their letters,
                           and hearing their expressions of joy at the good news they received.</p>

                        <p>"Our mission is on the Willamette river, the Multnomah of geographers, a
                           branch of the Columbia. The Indians are to us exceedingly kind, bringing
                           us mats, rushes, &amp;c. While I am now writing, there is an Indian woman
                           before me on her knees, gazing most intently at my movements, thinking,
                           probably, that what I am doing is a great wonder. There are also six
                           young Indians in the room, nearly naked, some with a piece of flannel
                           around them tied on one shoulder, and others with a piece of deerskin
                           about them, and a deep fringe around their loins, with their long hair
                           dangling about their shoulders. Poor things! I wish I had enough clothes
                           to cover them. I have disposed of nearly every article of my own clothes
                           that is possible to spare; I wish I had more to distribute gratuitously.
                           The Mr. Lees do not <emph>give away</emph> clothes only to those in their
                           care. Most of the above articles are for the natives, and if you find any
                           good friend disposed to contribute anything I have named, or anything
                           else, for me to give the Indians, who are not receiving benefit from the
                           mission, I should be extremely thankful. I am happy in my labors, though
                           not engaged in school-keeping. I visit the natives, talk with them, as
                           well as I can, sing and pray with them, hoping the Spirit of God may
                           impart to their minds serious impressions."</p>

                        had so long desired to be, and among those devoted servants of God with whom
                        she had most ardently wished to associate—that people who had <emph>left

                        earth—in the kingdom of this world. Men may have changed the place, but they
                        have kept their nature. They find the same hearts with them on mission
                        ground, as they had to mourn over in their native land.</p>
                     <p>We have accompanied Ruth through her preparatory course and over the seas to
                        the field of her future labors, through which we will also attend her; but
                        we shall not always find sunny skies and perennial flowers—smooth seas and
                        golden twilights—invigorating and perfumed gales—hospitable and loving
                        hearts; but clouds and storms, and blight-raging billows, and threatening
                        skies—sickening miasmas, and fiend-like hatred; converting this glorious
                        earth into the abode of demons, and appropriating these sublime
                        intelligences which we feel within the heart, and which well might lead us
                        to fellowship with the holy and eternal Omnipotent of the skies,
                        appropriating them to the base purposes of hatred, detraction, and
                        revenge!—employments fit only to occupy the attentions of the spirits of
                        Tartarus.</p>
                     <p>As a compiler, we should much prefer to omit this part of the work, but
                        consider it our duty to proceed, inasmuch as these occurrences had so great
                        an influence on the life of the subject of these memoirs.</p>
                     <p>The relation which Ruth held to Mr. Leland's family has been explained, and
                        it may be rendered, somewhat more clear by making a few quotations from a
                        letter addressed to her on the subject, during the voyage to the Islands, by
                        the Rev. Mr. Perkins. He says:</p>
                     <p>"Brother Leland is obliged to consider you <emph>one of his family.
                           Why,</emph> I will explain. In consenting to come on this mission, he
                        took it for granted that another family would accompany him. On my coming to
                        Boston <emph>single,</emph> he was disappointed, and refused to carry out
                        his wife, unaccompanied by another female; but to remedy what would
                        otherwise have prevented the present expedition, he proposed to the people
                        of Boston to take <emph>into his family</emph> a single female, <emph>on his
                           own responsibility, and in case the board of missions did not take her
                           off his hands,</emph> which was uncertain, to provide hereafter for her
                        maintenance. The proposal was accepted. You were recommended, and by him
                        received, and <emph>I suppose</emph> were made acquainted with the
                        circumstances. If, therefore, you conclude to take yourself from under his
                        guardianship, as I am informed, it should be done with a fair understanding
                        and due consideration of the consequences; and, let me add, not without
                        reasons publicly known, otherwise you would wrong him and yourself very
                        much.</p>
                     <p>"You may say that you do not consider yourself one of his family and under
                        his guardianship, but let me assure you that <emph>your friends at home
                           do,</emph> and until you choose another guardian it would be imprudent in
                        you to disclaim the connection.</p>
                     <p>"You will soon mingle with strangers. Bro. Leland will consider himself
                           <emph>bound</emph> to furnish you with a house and things comfortable,
                        unless you order otherwise; if you disclaim connection his
                           <emph>obligations</emph> will of course cease, and whatever he may do
                        then will be matter only of courtesy."</p>
                     <p>When the proposition was first made to Ruth to accompany Mr. Leland's
                        family, without an appointment, as there was not time to obtain one,
                           <emph>she,</emph> in the fullness of her confidence, would have decided
                        to go, and would have considered any pledge of proper treatment, on the part
                        of her mission friends, unnecessary; but her relations and friends of the
                        church, and particularly some preachers who had been connected with the
                        mission in Africa, decided differently. They knew more of the world and of
                        the hearts of men than she did, and said to her plainly: "If you go out to
                        Oregon without an appointment from the board, it is possible, yea probable,
                        that you will be required to serve <emph>in the kitchen,</emph> and
                           <emph>that</emph> you will not consider to be the work for which you
                        sacrifice so much to do."</p>
                     <p>From the diary of Ruth we also copy the following on this subject:</p>
                     <p>"The executive committee of the education society also objected to this
                        course, but as the time was limited to a week for the sailing of the vessel,
                        in which time they could not obtain an appointment from the board, they
                        consented, provided I were willing, to send me as a member of Mr. Leland's
                        family and have me remain so till such time as I could be regularly
                        appointed by the board as a teacher. They, and many acquaintances, felt
                        great solicitude for me on account of my leaving them <emph>single</emph>
                        and without acquaintance to befriend me in those seasons of exposure and
                        danger through which I must necessarily pass during a long voyage and in
                        foreign ports, and in every possible instance gained from Mr. Leland
                        assurances of the kindest attentions, which he promised to bestow upon me
                        and to treat me as one of his own children, being in every possible respect
                        a father to me."</p>
                     <p>Therefore the <emph>"pledge"</emph> was given her, signifying that Ruth
                        Rover should be sustained <emph>as a teacher</emph>, and in case the board
                        should not do this, those persons whose names were signed were obligated to
                        do it.</p>
                     <p>Her time during the voyages was said to be entirely at her own disposal.</p>
                     <p>Preliminaries now being arranged as was thought to be satisfactory, the
                        missionaries prepared to bid their friends farewell, when Miss Rover was
                        requested to <emph>not</emph> attend the farewell meeting in Boston, and was
                        informed that it would "probably be a hundred dollars in her pocket if she
                        should go, instead, to the farewell meeting in Saugus." She was greatly
                        disappointed at this announcement, for she had many warm friends in
                        Boston;</p>
                     <p>At the boarding house in Boston, when waiting for the brig to be in
                        readiness, Ruth was requested to eat at the second table, and wait upon Mr.
                        Leland's children. She <emph>did</emph> wait for the second table but we
                        believe she did not pay much attention to the children.</p>
                     <p>On the commencement of the voyage she suffered some from sea sickness, as
                        also did Mrs. Leland and the family, and was asked by Rev. Mr. Perkins why
                        she did not wait upon Mrs. Leland and the children, in taking care of their
                        clothing, &amp;c. She was much in want of a few articles which she had been
                        informed were on board of the vessel, directed to the "mission family," and
                        that she could use whatever she pleased of them. On enquiring of Mr. Leland,
                        he told her she had "no more right to any thing he had than any other
                        stranger."</p>
                     <p>At Valparaiso, Mr. Leland returned from the shore and requested his wife to
                        "hurry" and go on shore with him, for he had a place provided, &amp;c. Ruth
                        was informed by Mrs. Leland that she had better request Mr. Perkins to
                        provide her a boarding house. This she declined as she knew she had no right
                        so to do, and besides it would be indecorous for her thus to go among
                        strangers. Mr. Leland told her there was no room where they were going, only
                        for his own family. She nevertheless felt compelled to leave the vessel with
                        them, hoping that there would be some place found for her. She rested the
                        first night in the dining parlor on a sofa, without covering, and afterwards
                        received a very acceptable request from<pb n="40-41"
                           xml:id="VAC5702-00000021"/> Capt. and Mrs. Scott to remain at their house
                        while she should be in Valparaiso.</p>
                     <p>At Callao, in consequence of finding herself so unpleasantly situated at
                        Valparaiso, Ruth resolved that she would not go on shore at all, and
                        remained on board the brig, under the protection of Mr. Sheldon, an elderly
                        gentleman from Boston, and Capt. Kilham of the brig.</p>
                     <p>The Rev. Mr. Leland, during the voyage, very seldom attempted to conduct
                        divine worship on the Sabbath, or to hold family prayers, and when he did,
                        was generally very irregular in regard to time; and on these occasions Ruth
                        sometimes happened to be on the deck, and whenever she heard the voice of
                        prayer, she would pay attention at the sky-light till it was concluded.</p>
                     <p>Before arriving at the Sandwich Islands she had discovered that she must
                        rely on some other source for assistance and care when on shore, than on Mr.
                        Leland, as he had a family to look after which occupied much of his
                        attention and had the first claim on his regards.</p>
                     <p>At Oahu it was necessary to change vessels, and proceed to the Columbia
                        river in a barque belonging to the Hudson Bay Company. Mr. E. O. Hall of
                        Oahu, offered every attention to Ruth Rover, while at the islands, and she
                        requested him to see to the removal of her trunks to the other vessel and
                        that they were placed as they had been in the Peru, so as to enable her to
                        have access to them when at sea. Mr. Leland desired that he might be
                        entrusted with this business, said it was quite unnecessary to trouble Mr.
                        Hall, that he knew how they should be arranged, &amp;c., &amp;c. Mr. Leland
                        was accordingly trusted.</p>
                     <p>This seems a trivial and simple affair to record here, but 'tis introduced
                        merely because of the results which it produced.</p>
                     <p>After leaving the islands 'twas found that all of Ruth's trunks and chests
                        had been put under the hatches and could not be obtained during the voyage,
                        and that Mr. Leland had not attended to their disposal at all. Hence Ruth
                        was compelled to submit to the inconvenience of suffering for warm apparel,
                        and of doing without her work and books for twenty-five or thirty days. The
                        weather was becoming quite cold and she had only some light clothing which
                        she had taken on shore at Oahu as suitable for that climate. She did not
                        submit to this deprivation with a very good grace, especially as she
                        perceived that the cabins and closets were very much encumbered with
                        chattels belonging to Mr. Leland and family.</p>
                     <p>Had this been a solitary instance of neglect we don't know but Ruth might
                        have borne it without speaking, but as many such had preceded it, and her
                        mind was unreconciled to the thought that there was any necessity for this
                        neglect, she found herself saying to Mr. Leland:</p>
                     <p>"I do not wonder there is no more union in our midst, while so much of
                        selfishness is apparent."</p>
                     <p>"If you mean that <emph>I</emph> am selfish," said Mr. Leland, "you must
                        show that I am."</p>
                     <p>"I think you have been selfish, not only in this affair but in other things
                        since we left Boston."</p>
                     <p>"Well, we shall soon see our brethren in Oregon, and then we'll have it
                        decided whether I am or am not selfish."</p>
                     <p>"Very well, then, it shall be decided there if you say so."</p>
                     <p>"I <emph>do</emph> say so, and other things, too, I guess will have to be
                        settled before we come to the communion table together."</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Leland then exclaimed, in haste, "My dear! my dear! what are you
                        saying—do be careful what you say."</p>
                     <p>"I know very well what I am saying," he replied, "and I don't wish to be
                        interrupted when I'm talking!"</p>
                     <p>"Well, Mr. Leland," said Ruth, "you say this shall be decided by our
                        brethren in Oregon, whether you are selfish or not, and also other things
                        must be decided which you have against me. What are those other things?"</p>
                     <p>Mr. Leland, after a pause, replied: "Did you not say that in other things,
                        as well as this, you thought I had been selfish?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
                     <p>"Well, that is what I meant. These other things in which you said had been
                        selfish, must be settled before we come to the communion table
                        together."</p>
                     <p>Ruth readily discovered that this was changing ground, and considered there
                        was more involved, when coming from a preacher of the gospel, than the
                        trifling offence of looking more after his own property than another's,
                        which any person might have done. We all are selfish, to a greater or less
                        degree, and this is criminal only when involving a breach of some known
                        duty, or the commission of some wrong.</p>
                     <p>No more was said on the subject at this time, but the next day Mr. Leland
                        handed Ruth the following letter, which led to others being written, and for
                        the consideration of justice to the authors they are presented entire. On
                        the subject about which they are written we have only to say, it is, in many
                        cases, easier to speak or preach than to practice: <q>

                                       obtruding myself upon your attention a this time, than what
                                       presents itself upon the very face of this communication.</p>
                                    <p>"I have desired an opportunity to converse with you, in a
                                       christian manner, on the subjects which I shall here
                                       introduce. Subjects which I conceive involve moral
                                       principles; and affect the vital interests of christianity,
                                       and merit the most prompt and candid attention. I speak in
                                       reference to whatever may exist in your mind or my own, which
                                       interrupts the cordial reciprocity of christian fellowship
                                       and sympathy. Of the existence of feelings and tempers which
                                       ate incompatible with the spirit and precepts of the gospel,
                                       we have painful demonstration in the humiliating fact which
                                       cannot be disguised, but which stands forth as a monument of
                                       reproach and disgrace, (must I say to the christian cause?
                                       God forbid,) but to those through whose guilt and folly it
                                       has been occasioned, and on them let the confusion fall till
                                       tears of penitence shall wash it away. My language may be
                                       thought severe, but my feelings are not unkind. My heart
                                       bleeds, my spirit weeps, and I shame mantles my cheek, whilst
                                       I record the fact that a missionary family—honored with the
                                       confidence of the church—sustained by the prayers and
                                       beneficies of the christian community—sent forth to inculcate
                                       the holy principles, practices and influences of the gospel
                                       of peace among infidels and pagans; that they should so far
                                       lose sight of their high and holy work and of their awful
                                       responsibilities—that they should so far betray their trust
                                       and abuse the confidence of the church, by cherishing unholy
                                       tempers and dispositions which gender disunion and harshness,
                                       and which causes the milk of brotherly kindness to degenerate
                                       into gall!</p>
                                    <p>"And are not these the facts in reference to ourselves—to our
                                       own little missionary family? And what tends much to
                                       aggravate the case, it is well known to those with whom we
                                       sailed from our own country and to those with whom we now
                                       sail, that a state of feeling exists among us which will not
                                       suffer us to unite in our devotions! And have we not
                                       exhibited, to our own lasting disgrace, the revolting
                                       spectacle of a house divided against itself, in that while
                                       some of our numbers were engaged in reading the; scriptures
                                       and invoking the throne of grace, others of our own company
                                       have absented themselves from the scene of devotion, and have
                                       manifested the appearance of disapprobation or contempt by
                                       reading histories or novels, or walking on deck in company
                                       with those who profess no fellowship or sympathy for
                                       christianity or its disciples.</p>
                                    <p>"I repeat it. My heart bleeds! my spirit weeps!! and shame
                                       mantles my cheek!! that I am connected with a scene so
                                       revolting—so derogatory to the christian name:</p>
                                    <p>"You must needs perceive, my sister, that there is something
                                       wrong—radically wrong—and that this wrong must be righted. I
                                       am not disposed to exculpate myself and cast, the blame on
                                       you or any other person—but there is blame somewhere. It may
                                       rest wholly on me—if so, the greater the work of repentance
                                       before me; may God grant me grace to perform it.</p>
                                    <p>I wish to assure you, sister Rover, my object is not to cause
                                       you unnecessary<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC5702-00000022"/>
                                       pain, though I use plainness of speech. I am still your
                                       friend and harbor no other than the best of feelings towards
                                       you, however you may view the subject. I wish, however, to be
                                       understood as decided in my feelings that this state of
                                       things referred to must be put away, and to this I'm sure you
                                       will object. And why, then, should we not avail ourselves of
                                       the facility which the gospel provides—the blessed privilege
                                       of confessing and forsaking our sins, that we may obtain
                                       mercy—and exercise the christian graces of forgiveness and
                                       forbearance that we may dwell together in love.</p>
                                    <p>"I think that I can bear to be told my faults. Try me in this
                                       case, my sister—tell me plainly in what particulars I have
                                       offended, and what are those delinquencies of mine which have
                                       thrown a stumbling block in your way, by which I have
                                       forfeited your christian fellowship, and by which your
                                       confidence in my christian character is so shaken that you
                                       cannot be present when I attempt to conduct divine worship,
                                       nor hear a poor offending brother pray.</p>
                                    <p>"This I ask not as a favor, but as my right to be told my
                                       faults, and I trust, by the grace of God, I shall be disposed
                                       to make reasonable satisfaction.</p>
                                    <p>"You will here allow me to present to you some things which
                                       have been a source of pain and grief to me during some parts
                                       of the voyage, and which, I think, some explanation on your
                                       part.</p>
                                    <p>"The things referred to are the following, viz:</p>
                                    <p>1st. "Your reading histories or novels on this voyage, and in
                                       some instances in times of prayer.</p>
                                    <p>2d. "Your <emph>charging</emph> Mrs. Leland and myself with
                                       selfishness.</p>
                                    <p>3d. "Your absenting yourself during the time of reading the
                                       scriptures and morning and evening prayer, and thus treating
                                       the institutions of God with the appearance of disrespect, on
                                       board the Peru.</p>
                                    <p>"These things may appear to you unworthy of notice, or you
                                       may have reasons which in your estimation are sufficient to
                                       justify your conduct and reconcile it with the claims of our
                                       holy religion, but in my view some explanation is
                                       required.</p>
                                    <p>"I have thus undertaken the unpleasant duty of presenting
                                       this subject to consideration. I have undertaken to discharge
                                       this duty with christian frankness and fidelity, and also
                                       with christian tenderness; and I trust that you find me ready
                                       at any time to confess my faults—to make reasonable
                                       satisfaction and render a reason for my conduct.</p>
                                    <p>"And now, sister Ruth, we have no time to lose—if the
                                       providence of God favor us we shall soon join our brethren on
                                       missionary ground. Let us then be prepared to enter on our
                                       work in the unity of the spirit and the bonds of peace. But
                                       with what feelings would our brethren regard our arrival
                                       among them, should we introduce into their peaceful borders a
                                       spirit of strife and contention. Would they desire our
                                       arrival? Would not rather wish we had tarried at home?</p>

                                 <p>"DEAR SISTER: I would first invite your attention to the within
                                    enclosed sheet, and to what follows here as a supplement to the
                                    foregoing communication. I know that I have already written at
                                    length, but my heart is burdened—my mind is oppressed, and my
                                    spirit groans within me for utterance, and I feel it incumbent
                                    on me to present a few considerations as additional inducements
                                    for a speedy reconciliation.</p>
                                 <p>"And first, we are members of the same christian community. By
                                    our high and holy profession and baptismal vows we are
                                    incorporated with the mystical body of Christ, and members one
                                    of another. Is Christ our head. Are we his members? Do we
                                    possess the mind that was in him? and have we no forgiving
                                    spirit—no spirit of forbearance to exercise? Have we forgotten
                                    those golden precepts of our divine master? Have we lost sight
                                    of those blessed injunctions which teach us to put away all
                                    wrath, and bitterness, and malice, and hatred, and every evil
                                    work—and to walk in love, to dwell together in the unity of
                                    spirit and bonds of affection? No, say you, I have not forgotten
                                    those blessed rules! but how can they be practiced while things
                                    remain as they are? Things must not remain as they are—they are
                                    not right; but they may easily be set right if we will take
                                    gospel measures, and apply the gospel rule provided by our
                                    blessed Saviour for the healing of those wounds which disgrace
                                    ourselves and dishonor the Christian name.</p>
                                 <p>"And what are these rules which furnish a sovereign antidote,
                                    and what are the duties which they enjoin?</p>
                                 <p>"I answer—rather the word of God answers—</p>
                                 <p>1st. "That we forsake not the assembling of ourselves together
                                    for religious conversation and prayer.</p>
                                 <p>2d. "That we confess our faults one to another, and pray one for
                                    another that we may be healed. But, say you, I have particular
                                    trials, &amp;c., <unclear>and</unclear> that I cannot join with
                                    you in devotion. Well, admit that you have trials, and
                                       <unclear>that those</unclear>trials are occasioned by the
                                    faults or failings of your brother. What then?</p>
                                 <p>3d. "'If thy brother trespass against thee tell him of his
                                    fault, and if he repent thou hast gained thy brother.' Thy
                                    brother can bear to be told his faults.</p>
                                 <p>4th. "Our Lord's instructions are, "when thou bringest thy gift
                                    to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother has aught
                                    against thee, leave there thy gift, <emph>go</emph> first be
                                       <emph>reconciled</emph> to thy brother, and then come and
                                    offer thy gift."</p>
                                 <p>"Thus it appears that our blessed Lord has provided for the
                                    removal of every article of bitterness, that there need nothing
                                    remain to hurt or destroy in all God's mountain.</p>
                                 <p>"I had thought of urging other reasons for a speedy adjustment
                                    of this affair, but I forbear. I am sure that if what I have
                                    written is received in the spirit in which it is indited, there
                                    will be no difficulty in restoring a proper state of feeling,
                                    which if cultivated will lead to a proper course of conduct—but,
                                    whatever may be the result, I feel that I have done duty, and I
                                    wish here to record my solemn appeal to the Judge of all hearts
                                    that <emph>I hold myself in readiness to do all that is in my
                                       power, consistent with the nature of the case, to effect an
                                       immediate and happy reconciliation throughout out missionary
                                       family.</emph> Have I faults to confess—I am ready to confess
                                    them. Have I restitution to make?—I am ready to make it. If I am
                                    required to extend the mantle of charity over the failings of
                                    others, I am ready to do it.</p>

                                    <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Sir—I conclude the long communication you have
                                       handed me this afternoon is worthy of at least
                                          <emph>some</emph> reply.</p>
                                    <p>"In regard to the explanation of my conduct which you think
                                       is required, I will only say now that I have read histories
                                       during the voyage and thought it no harm; if it ever happened
                                       during the time of prayer 'twas accidental. I also have read
                                       the last volume of the "Children of the Abbey," and thought
                                       this no harm either, as you allowed your daughters to read
                                       those volumes. Whatever other books I have read were of their
                                       selection. I have had no others.</p>
                                    <p>"Of the selfishness of Mrs. Leland and yourself, I have been
                                       caused to think so by your having, in ever instance,
                                       appropriated entirely to yourselves every article which has
                                       been sent on board the vessel directed to the '<hi rend="i"

                                       have placed in my way to the sacramental table, is not

                                 <p>"SISTER ROVER: I have no assurance that I shall live to see the
                                    Oregon, and I do not wish to appear before my Judge with my sins
                                    unrepented of and unforgiven. I therefore consider that there is
                                    no time for <emph>me</emph> to delay the work of humiliation and
                                    repentance.</p>
                                 <p>"In your note of yesterday you mention the "stumbling block" I
                                    have placed in your way to the sacramental table. I am left to
                                    guess your meaning. If you refer to what you call my
                                       <emph>threat,</emph> I beg leave to explain my own meaning. I
                                    intended no threat, nor did I mean to express an intention to
                                    refer to adjustment of any matters to the discussion of our
                                    brethren in Oregon. I will state the case as I understand it:
                                    You blamed me because your chests were put under the hatches,
                                    and charged me with being selfish in that and in other things
                                    which you said you had discovered. I replied to you that it
                                    would not answer—there must be an explanation—that as we were
                                    shortly to join our brethren on shore, these things must be
                                    settled before we could constantly come to the communion table
                                    together. I mean to be understood to speak with reference to an
                                    immediate settlement. I meant no threat. I am sorry that I spoke
                                    as I did, seeing it has given you offence. As far as you feel
                                    yourself injured in this case I hope you will forgive me.</p>
                                 <p>"Having already stated to you my feelings in reference to other
                                    matters, I wish only to add, that as far as I am able to judge,
                                    I have endeavored to remove all the obstructions which I have
                                    cast in your way, or my own, to the sacramental table. I have
                                    nothing to refer to our brethren in Oregon. I shall not appear
                                    there as your accuser; and I will only add, that, as far as I am
                                    concerned, <emph>I am perfectly willing that this whole affair
                                       and all my conduct should undergo the investigation of my

                     <p>Ruth Rover having <emph>once</emph> made up her mind—which she thought was
                        sufficient on any subject—resolved not to waver and simply told Mr. Leland
                        that she had already informed him of what she thought was the proper course
                        for her to pursue, and that it was useless to insist on any change. As he
                        was willing the subject should be talked over by his brethren, it was the
                        best way, and would be the most satisfactory, in the end, for both
                        parties.</p>
                     <p>She was influenced to this decision, not so much for the injury she thought
                        she had received, for she considered that Mr. Leland had fully atoned for
                        it, and even humbled himself much more than she could have desired—but she
                        considered there was <emph>principle</emph> involved, inasmuch as Mr. Leland
                        was a preacher of the gospel and she believed he had been guilty of
                        falsehood, and not only in the instance referred to, but at other times
                        during their acquaintance. She wished merely an expression of the opinion of
                        some other person on the subject, and she knew of none who would treat the
                        case more properly than her brethren of the mission in Oregon.</p>
                     <p>This determination was perhaps well intended, but it did not result in good.
                        Better would it have been for her had she forgiven Mr. Leland his trifling
                        neglect and have left the rest with him and his Maker; and, if he had
                        faults, to have suffered others to have found them out.</p>
                     <p>At several times during the remainder of the voyage Mrs. Leland, with her
                        characteristic <emph>christian</emph> spirit, urged Miss Rover, with her
                        arms around her neck and tears on her cheeks, to suffer the affair to drop,
                        that they might join their brethren in love and peace with each other. But
                        no! Ruth Rover was firm as adamant, and tears and entreaties were in
                        vain.</p>
                     <p>Energy and firmness of character are admirable in some circumstances, but
                        when youth and inexperience resolve that they will accomplish certain ends,
                        without knowing what will be the consequences, and in spite of all the
                        admonitions of experience and the suggestions of wisdom, 'tis very
                        lamentable. It seemed to be a component part of Ruth's character to resolve
                        that, whatever she <emph>should</emph> accomplish, that she also
                           <emph>would</emph> accomplish; and obstacles might rise in vain—they only
                        nerved her to greater effort—and we verily believe that had she, at
                        different periods of her life, become persuaded that it was proper for her
                           <emph>to change the course of a river,</emph> she would have attempted
                        it. But such confidence in one's self, or in a superior power, implies
                        limited knowledge. Experience, 'tis said, is the best schoolmaster, and well
                        would it be if his instructions came before it was too late to profit by
                        them. Had Ruth Rover consented that the difficulties which had existed
                        between Mr. Leland and herself should have been settled before they met
                        their brethren in Oregon, the whole tenor of her life would have undoubtedly
                        been changed; but she persisted unflinchingly in what <emph>she</emph>
                        thought was the only honorable and just course—<emph>and well did she atone
                           for it.</emph>
                     </p>
                     <p>We just now find a paragraph in Ruth's hand writing, penned probably many
                        years ago, which as it does great credit to the amiable and lamented Mrs.
                        Leland, we will transfer it here. She says:</p>
                     <p>"Occasionally, during the remainder of the voyage, Mrs. Leland introduced
                        the subject of our disunion, deeply regretting that there was discord among
                        us and entreating me most affectionately to be reconciled to them, and
                        urging the propriety of living together in christian fellowship and love.
                        And in doing this she exhibited a degree of meekness and love which I never
                        witnessed in any female before. She truly was <emph>christian-like,</emph>
                        while <emph>I</emph> was unyielding to the last degree. In one of these
                        instances, in referring to Mr. Leland's conversation about joining the
                        brethren in Oregon, she said, 'I'm sure I never heard him speak so before—I
                        don't know what he meant—I'm very sorry.'"</p>
                     <p>When at the Sandwich Islands Mr. Leland informed the Rev. Mr. Bingham that
                        Ruth Rover was to remain in his family as a teacher or governess to his
                        children. When they arrived in the Columbia river, the report reached the
                        mission, at the Willamette, before the missionaries, <emph>that Ruth Rover
                           had come out as a servant in Mr. Leland's family.</emph> If there was not
                        existing somewhere an expectation or hope that such would ultimately be
                        Ruth's destination, it would be interesting to know from what source came
                        these reports. but 'tis said that "<choice>
                           <sic>bird's</sic>
                           <corr>birds</corr>
                        </choice> of the air carry the news," and them, at any rate, we will hold
                        responsible for the present.</p>
                     <p>The singular modes of living which Ruth discovered as she passed along among
                        people of different nations, occurred to her as outrageous and
                        insupportable. Hence, we find her, when first at sea, astonished that the
                        Hawaiian boy Charley could bear such a deprivation as sleeping in bed quilts
                        without sheets, and gave herself no rest till she had made a pair for him
                        out of cloth belonging to herself. She wondered how the seamen could handle
                        the ropes, when off Cape Horn, without mittens—and how the steward could run
                        around deck without a cap—and how he and Charley could bear to wear shoes
                        without socks—and employed much of her time in providing these articles for
                        them.</p>
                     <p>And when the company arrived at Champoeg, at the house of De Porte McKoy,
                        and were served with supper—tea made in a tin kettle and drank from two
                        cups, which had to answer for the party—meat set upon the table in a tin
                        pan, vegetables mixed with it, and bread laid upon the bare table—she
                        thought it most astonishing that they would consent so to live, and when
                        informed by Mr. McKoy that conveniences for the table could not be obtained
                        in the country, she told him that she would bear his needs in mind, and if
                        she could obtain any things for him, at the mission, for the use of his
                        table, she would send them to him. The gratitude she felt for his
                        hospitality induced her to make this offer, as he had provided every
                        possible comfort<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC5702-00000024"/> for the party and
                        had refused any compensation.</p>
                     <p>Ruth Rover's introduction to the mission we will give in her own words,
                        making no improvements in the style, considering the <emph>original</emph>
                        as the best:</p>
                     <p>"The Rev. Mr. Lee enquiring of Mr. Leland the destination of the different
                        members of the reinforcement, asked him what <emph>I</emph> had come to do.
                        Mr. Leland replied that I had "come without an appointment from the board,
                        and he did <emph>not know what I intended to do!</emph>"</p>
                     <p>"Believing that Mr. Leland intended, if possible, to hold me in his family
                        to teach his children, I asked Mr. Lee what situation in the mission he
                        would be able to give me—if I could have a school, &amp;c. Mr. Lee replied
                        that he had 'no particular business to assign me—he already had more females
                        in the family than could be well employed, and he did not understand why the
                        people at home were sending teachers to him—he had sent for none, &amp;c.,
                        and concluded by telling me that he had just decided on an arrangement in
                        relation to the employment of the females of the family, and that every
                        department was taken but the one with Mrs. Lee—that <emph>she</emph> had to
                        cook and wash dishes, and I might take a situation in that department if I
                        chose.' I told him that I had come without an appointment 'twas true, and
                        gave him the reason which had caused me to do so, but told him I had
                        received a "pledge" from certain preachers that I should be employed as a
                        teacher till the board at New York should signify what they wished me to do.
                        He said he had 'no other situation to offer me than that he had named.' I
                        told him that if he would give me liberty, I thought I could obtain a school
                        of Indian girls. He said he 'already had more Indians dependent on them than
                        they could feed.' I asked him if he were willing that I should return back
                        to Mr. Burnie's family, at Fort George, for I could obtain a school there.
                        He replied that he 'could give me no other business than that he had named,
                        viz: to assist Mrs. Lee in the kitchen.' I told him again that I was
                        unwilling to accept that situation—not that I was above such work—but
                        because my feelings had already been injured on that subject. He then
                        replied that 'if I would not accept such employment as he offered me, he
                        should not recognize me as a member of the mission family, and I had no
                        right to expect it of him.' I retired with feelings too disconsolate for
                        utterance, after asking permission to remain till I had in some measure
                        recruited my strength, put my wardrobe in order, &amp;c. In a few days I
                        obtained leave to tarry with Dr. White and work for my board. I made it
                        known to the mission that I was willing to do any kind of work, while there,
                        for the good of the mission or members of the family, and accordingly
                        Messrs. D. Lee, Wilson and Edwards, sent me their clothes to wash and mend;
                        also, Mr. J. Lee sent me some sewing to do for himself, some work for the
                        Indians' cook, and some bags to make for wheat."</p>
                     <p>In another journal we find the following:</p>
                     <p>"Was introduced to the Rev. J. Lee, superintendent of the M. Mission, by the
                        Rev. Mr. Leland, as a person who had come without an appointment, and he did
                        not know what it was my intention to do.' Mr. Lee also told his wife that he
                        'supposed I had come out to get a husband, and he did not want any such
                        persons about him.' Mr. Shepherd, also, one of the missionaries who had
                        accompanied us from Vancouver, had said that he 'knew I was a <hi rend="i"
                        />maniac from what he saw of me when at McKoy's, at Champoeg, in thanking
                        him for the dinner he had served, and telling him I would send him dishes,'
                        &amp;c. Mr. Leland did not try to remove this impression, but encouraged it
                        by saying I had come out 'on my own footing, which led Mr. Lee to suppose
                        that I was some over-zealous, weak-minded enthusiast, and he did not respect
                        me in travelling so far from home on such an errand, without authority, and
                        he did not wish to give me any encouragement. My feelings cannot be
                        described."</p>
                     <p>To conclude the controversy with Mr. Leland—Ruth says:</p>
                     <p>"I found an opportunity to tell Mr. Lee, that there were difficulties
                        existing between Mr. Leland and myself, which until they were settled, must
                        prevent us from meeting at the Lord's table together, and would be glad if I
                        could have an expression of his, or some other's opinions as to the one in
                        fault. He said he should listen to nothing, for he had found himself
                        involved in great difficulty when the other reinforcement came, by listening
                        to stories, and he should never listen to any more.' I then asked him to
                        tell me what was my proper course of conduct if I believed a preacher had
                        been guilty of uttering falsehoods; if it were necessary for me to speak of
                        it, or if I should say nothing about it; and told him that I had made
                        mention of it to no one, and only to himself in a private manner by way of
                        obtaining advice. He replied that "speaking untruths, in a preacher was a
                        criminal offence; and that if I knew it of any one I should not conceal it,
                        but first I must take the scripture course, viz: 'tell him his fault between
                        him and thee,' &amp;c., and if I could not be persuaded by this but that he
                        were guilty, I should tell it to the church.'"</p>

                                    <hi rend="i"/>Respected Sir: I have had an interview with Mr.
                                    Leland. and I think proper to inform you of the conclusion of
                                    our conversation. He declares he knows no reason why I should
                                    not be received into the mission family and into the church
                                    here, and enjoy the privileges of the same as I have been
                                    accustomed to enjoy them. He was able in some instances to lead
                                    me to suppose I might have been mistaken on the subject of his
                                    speaking untruths, but in <emph>two</emph> instances, at least,
                                    my impressions remain as they were. I however told him that I
                                    now had done what I considered my duty and I should trouble him
                                    no farther—the matter now rested with him and his God. As you
                                    refuse to hear the particulars of the case, there is no more
                                    that I can do.</p>

                     <p>Rev. Mr. Leland, soon after this, called on Dr. White and told him he was
                        very happy to be able to say there was no longer any difficulty existing
                        between himself and Ruth Rover, but all their troubles were amicably
                        settled.</p>
                     <p>Ruth Rover also called on Mrs. Leland and asked her forgiveness for
                        occasioning unhappiness to her for so long a time, and expressed a hope that
                        it would now be all forgotten. Meeting Mr. Leland, as she left the house,
                        she said to him that she supposed the difficulty was all past and there was
                        probably nothing more to be spoken about. He replied: "No, only the
                        certificate." Not comprehending his meaning, Ruth passed on to her
                        employment. She had by this been received into the mission family and was
                        teaching the Indian school.</p>
                     <p>Rev. Mr. Lee was about this time holding meetings on business with the male
                        members of the family, on subjects connected with the mission. One morning
                        Ruth found written on a slip of paper, lying on the floor of the mission
                        house, the following <emph>resolution,</emph> by Mr. Leland. Ruth says:</p>
                     <p>"I found this on the floor of the mission house the next morning after Mr.
                        Leland's house had been burnt, and which had, I suppose, been lost in the
                        hurry. I showed it to one of the brethren, and he acknowledged that it had
                        been read at one of their meetings. I laid it, as I supposed, in a secure
                        place till I should go to my room, but when I returned it was among the
                        missing!</p>

                        the character of Rev. D. Leland, are worthy of no consideration."</p>
                     <p>In a few mornings after I found in the desk of the school room a certificate

                        informed her that Mr. Leland had utterly refused to have the subject
                        investigated there, saying he "did not come to Oregon to be judged by his

                     <p>In the journal we find this item:</p>
                     <p>"I had attempted to relate the particulars of the case to Mr. Lee, and he
                        told me he had 'resolved to listen to no more complaints from individuals in
                        the mission.' As, therefore, none of the members of the mission family knew
                        aught of the particulars connected with my suspicions in regard to Mr.
                        Leland, I fully believed they were not qualified to present such a testimony
                        of their favorable opinion of him as the certificate contained, as it was an
                        opinion founded on no knowledge whatever. Mr. Lee contended that he had a
                        right to his <emph>opinion,</emph> and a right to do as he pleased in giving
                        or not giving such a certificate. I allowed that he <emph>had a right</emph>
                        to do by a person as he pleased, and as that person should consent to, but
                        he had <emph>no</emph> right to injure <emph>me</emph> for the benefit of
                        another.</p>
                     <p>"Mr. Lee also added that it was not his place to call for an investigation,
                        and Mr. Leland had said he would never submit to be judged by his brethren
                        in Oregon—hence, Mr. Leland perceiving he could not safely retain the
                        certificate without a previous investigation, resolved to cause me to meet
                        him '<emph>face to face</emph>' as his <emph>accuser.</emph>
                     </p>

                     <p>On this occurrence Ruth says:</p>
                     <p>"I perceived at once that notwithstanding I had wished an expression of the
                        opinion of some of the brethren on the matter of the differences between Mr.
                        Leland and myself, that in complying with this requirement of Messrs Lee and
                        Leland, I must appear as the <emph>accuser</emph> of the latter—the which I
                        never was, nor wished to be—and also if I <emph>had</emph> thus appeared, I
                        could produce no proof, of which they were well aware, as the occurrences
                        happened at sea and were observed by none but ourselves; and furthermore the
                        Discipline required that a minister should be tried by <emph>three
                           ministers,</emph> and there were none in Oregon but the three who had
                        already signed their names to the certificate saying, in their opinion, Mr.
                        Leland was <emph>not guilty.</emph> Hence there was little chance of my
                        obtaining an impartial judgment."</p>
                     <p>Ruth, therefore, sent to Mr. Lee, the following answer:</p>

                                    meet Mr. Leland, 'face to face,' 'and give the grounds for the

                                    according to the Discipline of our church, unless I can so

                                    Discipline, section 8th, any instructions given in regard to the
                                    treatment of the <emph>originator</emph> of a

                                    that person is not myself. Farther, the Discipline requires that
                                    the '<emph>accused</emph> and the <emph>accuser</emph>' be

                                 <p>"MY DEAR SISTER—Your remarks in reference to the originator of a
                                    report I consider mere cavilling.</p>
                                 <p>"If I understand the true sense of the matter it is this: The
                                    person with whom an idea originates, if it be known to a second
                                    person, must necessarily be the reporter of it—for if it remain
                                    with the originator it is but an idea still, and not a report;
                                    but, if it be known to another, it is then a report, and a
                                    report implies a reporter, and this can be no other than the
                                    originator. And, if the report contains a charge or accusation;
                                    the reporter is of course the accuser. I think, therefore, you
                                    are bound to meet Mr. Leland, 'face to face,' as appointed, or
                                    amicably adjust the matter with him in some other way.</p>
                                 <p>"Mr. Leland informs me that the certificate to which you refer,
                                    is not, and never has been in his possession—and he does not
                                    desire it should be if this matter can be fairly settled. You
                                    are aware that I earnestly desire that this matter should be
                                    settled by yourselves—but feeling myself <emph>obliged,</emph>
                                    by his letter, I took the course the Discipline directs, to have
                                    it investigated. Mr. Leland will consent to no investigation but
                                    what is<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC5702-00000026"/> according to
                                    Discipline, and if you utterly refuse to have such an one, there
                                    can, of course, be none.</p>
                                 <p>"I have not much reason to think that you will put much
                                    confidence in what I am about to say, yet I feel it to be my
                                    duty to say to you that I entertain no other than
                                       <emph>friendly</emph> feelings towards you, and that I should
                                    be happy to do anything to remove your embarrassments, and make
                                    you comfortable and happy, that I can do in justice.</p>
                                 <p>"With earnest prayers to Almighty God to direct us all in this

                                       <emph>myself</emph> compelled to take farther trouble for the
                                    adjustment of this foolish affair, as well as to trouble
                                       <emph>you,</emph> and which, if you are as tired as
                                       <emph>I</emph> am, it must be unpleasant to read, as well as
                                    to write.</p>
                                 <p>"Of your remark in regard to 'cavilling,' I think I need not
                                    take much notice, as I cannot perceive that it affects the
                                    conclusion at all, for, if I am the <emph>reporter,</emph> I am
                                    only the reporter of saying I <emph>believe</emph> Mr. Leland is
                                    guilty, not of saying he <emph>is</emph> guilty.</p>
                                 <p>"Farther, admit that I reported my belief to you,
                                       <emph>you</emph> must have reported it to others or it would
                                    never have done any harm.</p>
                                 <p>"With reference to the Discipline, it is the
                                       <emph>accuser</emph> not the <emph>reporter,</emph> who is
                                    required to meet the accused, for, in my opinion,
                                    notwithstanding what you say to the contrary, the reporter of a
                                    suspicion is not the accuser of a crime.</p>
                                 <p>"Mr. Leland's not having the certificate in his possession does
                                    not alter the case at all, for you remarked to me that it was as
                                    much Mr. Leland's as if he had it, and you had no right to add
                                    anything to it without his consent.'</p>
                                 <p>"I thank you for <choice>
                                       <sic>you</sic>
                                       <corr>your</corr>
                                    </choice> expressions of <emph>friendly</emph> feelings, towards
                                    me, but from my limited acquaintance with you, I am not able to
                                    judge whether you are or are not thus friendly, only by your
                                    treatment of me. If you are sincere in these expressions, I must
                                    conclude that for want of penetration you did not discover the
                                    fallacy of the certificate you lately authorized to be written
                                    without my knowledge, which I believe any person would think was
                                    synonymous to saying: We consider her a person who talks at
                                    random, and therefore it is our opinion that her statements are
                                    entitled to no credit.</p>
                                 <p>"The present difficulty, Mr. Lee, if I understand it, is between
                                    the persons whose names are on that certificate and Mr.
                                    Leland—or, perhaps, with them and me—and <emph>not</emph> with
                                    Mr. Leland and myself.</p>
                                 <p>"If I have done wrong in any particular of the affair, let it be
                                    shown. You say I should not express an opinion unless I can
                                    sustain it.' I suppose you mean unless I can <emph>prove</emph>
                                    to <emph>be</emph> true what I <emph>think</emph> to be true. If
                                    a friend cannot to a friend unburthen his or her burthened
                                    heart, farewell forever to social intercourse. The turning point
                                    now seems to be the <emph>certificate.</emph> Shall it be given
                                    as it <emph>is,</emph> or as I said it must be if bearing my
                                    name? If you decide it shall be given as it <emph>is,</emph> I
                                    shall, as I have informed you, leave the mission. I think that
                                    to decide thus would be to treat me unjustly, and I am willing
                                    to abide the consequences; and if you are uncertain about its
                                    propriety, I think to retract would be no more than
                                    honorable.</p>
                                 <p>"If there is likely to be much time consumed before the final
                                    conclusion, I object not to again commence the school if it be
                                    desirable.</p>

                     <p>We now present another item from the journal:</p>
                     <p>"Mr. Leland being unwilling to be without the certificate, called on me
                        frequently, in company with Mr. Lee, and once appointed a committee of three
                        to wait on me to see if I could not be persuaded to consent. I told them I
                        could not discover at all why Mr. Leland should expect such an article from
                        the brethren, as the case did not at all affect them, and that I thought
                        that <emph>I</emph> was the person of whom he should ask a certificate, and
                        if he desired one of me I would give him one, and such a one as he would not
                        show very often. I related to this committee some of the reasons I had for
                        my suspicions of Mr. Leland, and asked them their opinions; and they said
                        they thought I had very good grounds for believing Mr. Leland guilty of
                        selfishness and falsehood.</p>
                     <p>"Finally, after many altercations between us, Mr. Leland said he did not
                        intend to show the writing to any body unless he should learn that I had
                        spoken of this to others and was willing to promise in writing that he never
                        would show it only for this reason; and Mr. Lee also said he was willing to
                        give me in writing their conviction that they did not suspect
                           <emph>me</emph> of speaking untruths in this affair and having informed
                        Mr. Lee that, as my principle objection to an investigation had arisen from
                        the fact that Mr. Leland must be tried, if at all, by the three ministers
                        present, viz: Messrs. J. Lee, D. Lee and H. K. W. Perkins, all whom had
                        expressed an opinion, yet, if at any future time there would arrive
                        ministers in Oregon who were disinterested, I would consent to the trial. It
                        was decided that Mr. Leland should retain the certificate as at first
                        written.</p>
                     <p>"Just at this moment the dinner bell rung, and as there was not then time
                        for the interchange of papers, it was agreed that immediately after dinner
                        they would come over for that purpose. But they did not come and I heard
                        nothing farther on the subject."</p>
                     <p>Ruth Rover having informed Mr. Lee that she would give Mr. Leland an
                        opportunity for a fair trial, if one should ever present itself, informed
                        him, on the 6th of July, 1840, of her willingness to this in the following
                        note:</p>

                                 <p>"SIR—In addressing to you this note my object is not to revive
                                    unpleasant sensations which some time since existed between us,
                                    but to remind you that it is now your privilege to improve the
                                    present advantage in the decision of the case which our minds
                                    were exercised in the winter of '37.</p>
                                 <p>"If, therefore, you desire it, the same may be acted upon by any
                                    member or number of members of the late reinforcement of
                                    missionaries, at any time you shall choose for that purpose.</p>
                                 <p>"Perhaps I should have addressed this note to Mr. Lee rather
                                    than yourself, but, as I suppose you will acquaint him with its
                                    import, it is probably unimportant.</p>

                     <p>We again refer to the journal:</p>
                     <p>"Mr. Leland did not reply to me, and I did not see him again till the
                        December following, when I asked him if he received my note. He said he did,
                        and he had informed Mr. Lee that I had written to him, and he concluded it
                        was not best to disturb the minds of the brethren with it, but he did not
                        know but Mr. Lee might yet wish the case investigated."</p>
                     <p>The enquiry here suggests itself: What was Mr. Leland's object in
                        endeavoring to obtain that certificate? Was it merely for the security of
                        his own reputation? If so, why did he not take it when it was rendered to
                        him? On the other hand, does there not appear reason to suppose he wished it
                        more for the purpose of obtaining disgrace to Ruth Rover, in the fact that
                        when that object was to be counteracted by his restrictions to show the
                        certificate to no one, and by one to be given to Ruth by Mr. Lee, certifying
                        that her character for veracity was not injured in his estimation, then he
                        was not at all anxious to obtain it?</p>
                     <p>From this time Rev. Mr. Leland was to Ruth Rover a confirmed enemy. And
                        although at times he wore the garb of a friend, yet <emph>revenge</emph> was
                        in the heart, and only waiting an opportunity to appear in its own hideous
                        colors.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi rend="i"/>Sept., 1837. "A few days since was received into the mission
                        family and have since been treated kindly and affectionately by my brethren,
                        which has greatly relieved my mind of unpleasant forebodings and given rise
                        to my former anxiety for the good of these Indians. I find them in a
                        suffering and benighted condition, with the exception of thirty children who
                        are at school at the mission house. The natives, as far as I can discover,
                        are without instruction. The members of our family who have been in this
                        place three years have made a few attempts to teach them the knowledge of
                        God, but find it a very difficult task to convey to their minds a correct
                        idea of his existence or nature, or of their accountability. Their language
                        is by no means copious, and presents no words capable of conveying an
                        understanding of these things. The missionaries of our reinforcement, with
                        those here before us, consider it to be of great importance that an effort
                        be immediately made to moralize the adult portion of the Indians—but we may
                        labor, and labor in vain, if we make not God our dependence.</p>
                     <p>"Visited some Indian huts this afternoon; saw several small and beautifully
                        intelligent looking children—a babe but a few months old, healthy, pretty
                        and happy; several women, and one extremely old female, wrinkled, tottering,
                        dirty, and, I should thing, wretched. Their houses are made of boards
                        resting upon the ground and against each other at the atop, or with a
                        blanket, or skin, or pieces of bark thrown upon bushes. In these poor shades
                        these comfortless beings will spend their lives, exposed to all the changes
                        of weather, and depending upon anything but their own endeavors for a
                        livelihood. 'Tis no wonder that many of the tribes are extinct, so great is
                        their degradation and misery.</p>
                     <p>"After divine service this forenoon, at the mission house, visited the
                        Indians, and talked, and sang, and prayed with them. I did not expect to be
                        understood by them, but hoped they might be led to ponder upon their
                        condition. I am led to reflect much on the present and future state of the
                        heathen. On christians who are now sleeping in their graves will fall the
                        guilt, I believe, of there being one unenlightened mind now on the globe,
                        and if their souls are lost their blood will be required at their hands.</p>
                     <p>"Eighteen hundred years ago the commandment 'Go into all the world and
                        preach the gospel to every creature,' was as plainly laid before christians
                        as that which says, 'Thou shalt love thy God,' and I believe that had they
                        commenced and continued to exert themselves, as it was the design of their
                        master they should do, there would not now be a soul on earth unacquainted
                        with the way of salvation.</p>
                     <p>"Visited the Indians again. Although 'tis the Sabbath, found one aged woman
                        making a mat—others laughing and hallooing most indecently, and some sick
                        lying upon the ground with only a straw mat beneath them and a deerskin over
                        their naked bodies—no pillows, no sheets or quilts, or beds, or clothing, or
                        nourishment—no sympathy, no friends, no heavenly consolations, and these are
                        the heathen I hope to benefit in some measure, at least. I wish to improve
                        every moment of leisure in learning the language—imparting what instructions
                        are possible, and gaining their good will and confidence. The Indian
                        children are generally ly very rugged in appearance; the babes I have seen
                        are extremely fleshy. Have been much pleased with one Indian girl—call her
                           <emph>my</emph> girl, and have named her Olive Davis, for one of my dear
                        sisters. May she become as worthy a woman.</p>
                     <p>"Isabella Derton died on Sabbath morning. She was an Indian woman aged
                        fifteen years, and was married when but twelve years of age. A pulmonary
                        consumption terminated her existence. During her illness she gave remarkable
                        evidence of patience and submission, and had evidently met with a change of
                        heart. On the night of her death, being asked if she were happy, if she
                        loved God, &amp;c., she made great exertions to answer yes, and to answer
                        with emphasis, as if greatly desirous that we should know that she was happy
                        and willing to exchange worlds. When she breathed her last, I had the
                        unspeakable satisfaction, yet solemn privilege, of holding her in my arms
                        and directing her to give herself into the hands of God; and when praying
                        that He would receive her spirit, was myself greatly favored with divine
                        influences. It seemed almost as if heaven were opened to us both, and I
                        could hardly resign her to go alone, so great was my desire to dwell also
                        with the blest. O! how pleasant is the work of God! how delightful the
                        employment of guiding the departing soul in the way of heaven.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="i"/>Monday."Isabella was buried to-day. The corpse was attended to
                        the grave by the members of the mission family, our French neighbors, some
                        wild Indians, and the children of the school—the procession numbering
                        seventy or eighty persons.</p>
                     <p>"Called at chief Caleb's huts. Found four Indians sick and lying upon the
                        ground without clothing or beds—others sitting idly in the ashes and smoke,
                        with the entrails and hoofs of a horse lying about, they having eaten the
                        body. Find myself very happy in the mission field, although not particularly
                        engaged except for the temporal wants of the missionaries. My school will
                        afford me opportunities to become better acquainted with the native
                        language, and by giving me such free access to the children, will multiply
                        the probabilities of my benefitting this race. Great is the goodness of my
                        heavenly Father in reviving me in the spirit of my mind—in strengthening my
                        faith—in sustaining and comforting my broken spirit, and in granting me that
                        strength of mind which my severest afflictions have not been able to
                        overcome—that fortitude, resolution and patient endurance I have found so
                        requisite to my support—that trust in Him which all my enemies, the
                        infirmities of the flesh, and the artifices of satan, have not been able to
                        destroy.</p>
                     <p>"To-day had painful evidence of the strength of sin over the mind which has
                        never been under the improving influences of christian tuition, in that of
                        the stubbornness of one of the Indian boys. By no persuasion of threat could
                        I induce him to yield the point about which he contended. I felt the keenest
                        sorrow for having to resort to severity, and could not refrain from weeping
                        before God in interest for him. The child is an orphan—his only sister died
                        in my arms, and is doubtless praising God in heaven, and perhaps hovers over
                        her brother with deep interest. I never felt more anxious for anyone's
                        conversion than I do for this dear child's.</p>
                     <p>The dispositions of these children are materially different from children in
                        the United States, or elsewhere, that have been subjected to rigorous
                        discipline from their earliest childhood. The slightest provocation—even the
                        request to pronounce a word the second time, which was not distinctly heard,
                        will excite their anger beyond control—the child often retaliating with
                        blows and most abusive language, if his teacher resorts to chastisement.
                        Much discretion is necessary in a teacher, and the best way I have
                        discovered in teaching is to be mild and lenient, and, without stooping
                        below a requisite dignity, endeavor to convince them of the advantages of
                        well-doing, as opposed to stubbornness and misconduct.</p>
                     <p>"Visited an aged sick woman—wife of one of our French neighbors. She is very
                        low in consumption, and three members of her family have lately died of the
                        same disease. Although a member of the Catholic church, where baptism is<pb
                           n="54-55" xml:id="VAC5702-00000028"/> considered to produce a saving
                        change, she is quite unreconciled to death, and anticipates no happiness in
                        leaving this world. The Indian girl whom I named Olive Davis, has offered
                        herself to Mrs. B—, to live with her, and her sister, E. Davis, whom I have
                        also taken to raise, I have given to the mission.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="i"/>Sabbath. "Went to the lodges, early this morning, and invited
                        the Indians to come to church when the bell should ring. Several came in
                        their best attire, and gave very patient and respectful attention to the
                        services—kneeling in prayer, and standing with the congregation when
                        singing. Although it is not supposed that they understand what is said, yet
                        they have some idea of the difference between the Sabbath and other days,
                        and also that it is the Great Spirit above us whom we address and talk
                        about.</p>
                     <p>"Some time last week an Indian chief murdered an Indian. The mission
                        brethren expostulated with him, and the reasons which he gave were that he
                        was his slave and had attempted to take his own life. Had an interesting
                        conversation with Mr. R—, a French neighbor, on the subject of religion. He
                        is a Catholic, but says he likes any religion which will learn him to do
                        right. There are a few families of French near us who are decidedly kind,
                        and too <emph>polite</emph>, apparently, to do a mean act.</p>
                     <p>"Rev. Mr. Leslie has been appointed by Mr. Lee missionary to the Calapooyas.
                        He said, a few days since, he could never allow them to live in such
                        wretched houses, and went out, axe in hand, to build them better, but he has
                        cut his foot and got discouraged.</p>
                     <p>"Invited the Indians again, this morning to attend church. They came in
                        larger numbers—the women with their best dresses and their hair in its best
                        braids—evidently thinking they were honoring and being honored by the
                        circumstance. Visited them in their huts, much to their and my own
                        gratification. They tell me if I will learn to talk with them, they will
                        give me a plenty of <hi rend="i"/>wah-wah for nothing—probably more than I
                        could stow away.</p>
                     <p>"The Indians came to church to-day and took seats very orderly, when Mr.
                        Leslie told them to sit outside on the steps, and make room for the French.
                        They left altogether, and probably will come back no more."</p>
                     <p>The journals of Ruth Rover, at this period, are copious, but as they relate
                        to acts which are not interesting here, make but few extracts. The same of
                        her letters. We shall copy only such parts as will denote her employments,
                        wishes, and prospects, relating to missionary operations. To her parents she
                        says:</p>
                     <p>"This is probably thanksgiving day in Massachusetts, and how delightful is
                        now the recollection of the last I spent at home with you and my sisters and
                        brothers. When I recall <emph>them</emph> to mind 'tis with pleasure, and
                        with almost an assurance that I shall see them again—but when my thoughts
                        revert to yourselves, the big tears will start and threaten tremblingly to
                        fall and mar the impress of my pen—but let them start and fall till their
                        fountain is empty, and they cannot denote all the love I entertain for my
                        dear parents. How differently I am situated to-day from what I was one year
                        ago in my father's house; <emph>then</emph> surrounded with friends, and
                        burdened with the sight of luxuries and dainties—<emph>now</emph> lonely,
                        and in the strictest sense destitute of indulgences to tamper the
                           appetite—<emph>then</emph> I could feast on good things to
                           surfeit—<emph>now</emph> can see before me only <emph>stewed peas, fried
                           bread, and pea coffee—then</emph> could see my mother pleasantly and
                        assiduously laboring to have every little service performed to render her
                        guests happy, and my father, also, making every effort to be agreeable, anon
                        kissing the babies, stirring the fires, regretting that he could not do
                        more, and expressing his own satisfaction in leaving us at home on such an
                        occasion; but <emph>now</emph> I look around and stretch my eyes far and
                        wide without their meeting one kindred spirit, and listen to every sound
                        that vibrates on the ear and hear no salutations—no expressions of regard—no
                        anxious enquiries about health or happiness—and no regrets for want of more
                        to gratify the appetite. O! dear! I sometimes, like the Israelites, almost
                        sigh for the dainties of Egypt, yet I am not sorry that this thanksgiving
                        day finds me in Oregon.</p>
                     <p>"Dear parents, <emph>do</emph> continue to please, and cherish, and support,
                        and sustain each other amid the infirmities of old age, as shall enable the
                        thread of life to be lengthened out for the six years for which I am engaged
                        here, that I may be blessed on my return with a sight of yourselves in
                        health mid happiness. And you, my little brother, let me request you
                           <emph>particularly</emph> to provide for the comforts of the old
                        gentleman, my father, that he may live till my return to make me unspeakably
                        blest.</p>
                     <p>"Please tell brother S—, who inquires what he shall send me, tell him
                        everything but <emph>finery</emph> is needed here. You could gain some idea
                        of the wants of this people if you should go away into the woods and make a
                        fire of a few sticks—divest yourself of clothing—attempt to live without
                        food, or prepare that of some putrid animal without any <choice>
                           <sic>conviences</sic>
                           <corr>conveniences</corr>
                        </choice> for doing so but a stick and the fire, and realize that you have
                        no society but that of wolves, panthers, bears, snakes, &amp;c., &amp;c. If
                        you can obtain any idea of the destitution of this people will you not have
                        charity for them and endeavor to encourage it in others? There have been
                        many boxes of clothing sent here for Indians, but the superintendent will
                        part with them only to the Indian children in the mission family. There are
                        many adult Indians in the huts near, especially females, who are very
                        destitute—indeed I can scarcely bear to go among them in consequence of
                        their nudity. Of the articles I brought for two years use, nearly all are
                        disposed of. I have given away of my own apparel till I am almost
                        comfortless, and I can do but little more. But I will trust in God and to
                        the sympathies of the good people of New England. As often as I leave
                        leisure I assemble a circle of Indian women around me to learn them to sew
                        and knit for themselves. The employment, how delightful!—the spectacle, how
                        revolting!—for they are mostly unclothed, <emph>Do</emph> give me old
                        garments, or anything to cover them—and give them to <emph>me</emph>,
                           <emph>not</emph> to the superintendent—that I may, when I clothe myself,
                        do so with pleasure, and not with pain that others must be destitute."</p>
                     <p>"BELOVED BROTHER:—You wish me to write <emph>particularly</emph>, and give
                        you such a description of the state of things as will enable you to
                        understand our situation, prospects, wants, success, &amp;c. I wish I might
                        write something interesting, but I presume but little connected with our
                        mission will be gratifying.</p>
                     <p>"I hardly know <emph>what</emph> to write, there is little of novelty
                        connected with a mission to the Indians. In respect to them, I will,
                        however, say, that we find them the most inoffensive, as well as indolent
                        and degraded people imaginable. Indeed, we go about the prairies and forests
                        with as much careless indifference as if we were surrounded with insects
                        only. With entire confidence we leave our doors and windows unfastened, and
                        admit numbers of them into our houses, with muskets, tomahawks, and knives
                        in their hands. The Kallapooya tribes are considered the most inactive upon
                        the coast. Even other tribes if reproached with being lazy, will reply that
                        they are not Kallapoyas. They appear willing to work, however, when they
                        want to eat and have no food, and are pleased with acquiring any new art.
                        The coming summer, Mr. Leslie intends to superintend them in the
                        agricultural department, having improved land for that purpose. The produce
                        of their labor is to be their own. They seem pleased with the project, but
                        will, it is likely, fancy that they must be highly rewarded for their pains.
                        The native language of these Indians, has not yet been learned by any one of
                        the missionaries, consequently our labors are, defined mostly to the
                        children in the mission family, who are learning English. There is, however,
                        a kind of jargon spoken and learned for purposes of trade, which is familiar
                        to several tribes, and easily acquired, by which some knowledge of their
                        lost condition may be communicated to the adults.</p>
                     <p>"There are in the Mission family and Mission house, twenty-five boys and ten
                        girls, who are provided for by Mr. and<pb n="56-57"
                           xml:id="VAC5702-00000029"/> Mrs. Shepherd, Mr. Whitcomb, and myself. To
                        conduct them properly is not a small task. Mr. Whitcomb has the
                        superintendence of the farm, Mr. Shepherd the first oversight of the boys
                        and the school, while I endeavor to supply the place of Mrs. Lee in the
                        Mission family, and am to have the care of the girls.</p>
                     <p>"The Mission house, built of logs is situated near the banks of the
                        Willamette. We expect, by two winters more, it will, notwithstanding its
                        great firmness (for the logs are oak, and were strongly laid up by Mr. Jason
                        Lee himself.) be drifted down the stream, and away from sight. Dr. White has
                        a fine block-house, situated upon a pleasant and extensive prairie with a
                        delightful evergreen grove of fir trees upon one side, and the agreeable
                        variety of valley, hill, ponds of clear water, bushes, brakes and groves of
                        fir, oak, maple and cotton wood, and deer, wolves, snakes, &amp;c., upon the
                        background. Mr. Leslie lives in a one story square-logged house, formerly
                        owned by one of our French neighbors, and inhabited by half-breed people and
                        Indians. The number of rooms has been increased to three. Mr. Beers' house
                        is of logs from the delightful fir grove in front of the mission, laid
                        together without squaring, barking or straightening, and openings filled
                        with moss and mud. He has the finest situation in the potato-field.</p>
                     <p>"Our provisions are good enough for us, who have tasted the luxuries of
                        another land and were never thankful for them. We have fine salmon in
                        plenty, about two-thirds of the year, and bread, potatoes, and milk, perhaps
                        the same length of time. Some of us have the remains of sweetmeats which we
                        brought with us, and which we occasionally taste, yet sparingly, for fear of
                        tasting the last. This brings a train of reflections, melancholy and
                        pleasing, which we indulge a little, and then chide, hide the remembrance,
                        and proceed about our duties."</p>

                                 <p>The long, pleasing and profitable acquaintance I have had with
                                    you—the proofs I have received of your sympathy for the
                                    distressed, and the liberal encouragement you gave and rendered
                                    to one who was lately membered with you in such privileges and
                                    social intercourse, begotten within my breast a wish to acquaint
                                    you with some of the wants of suffering in this portion of the
                                    world.</p>
                                 <p>"A large share of the bounties of providence to you has been
                                    cheerfully bestowed to promote the spread of the gospel in
                                    heathen lands; and here are numbers who are daily made happy by
                                    your generosity, while your humble petitioner has hourly reason
                                    to be reminded of your kindness, and to find increased within
                                    her breast the great affection she has for you.</p>
                                 <p>"With others of your acquaintance, I am laboring to raise the
                                    condition of the heathen; and in our field of labor we find men
                                    of intelligent minds—women of endearing natural qualities, and
                                    children possessing promising talent, in the lowest condition
                                    that ignorance and poverty can place them.</p>
                                 <p>"To benefit them is the employment of this missionary band. And
                                    while thirty- two beneath this roof are depending upon our
                                    labors and the benevolence of christians in this wide world,
                                    others are thronging our path, wandering about almost
                                    uncovered—surviving upon wild roots, flower seeds and
                                    carrion—needing, suffering, yet insensible and contented.</p>
                                 <p>"For these, our hearts bleed. For these, my beloved

                                    resolved to invite you to make yet another effort to befriend
                                    them. <emph>Will</emph> you assist in so clothing them that they
                                    may, with propriety, come into our presence for purposes of

                                 <p>"I ask no more. For their tuition there will doubtless be
                                    abundant means provided. For their sustenance our brethren hope
                                    to be able to induce them to labor—but for their
                                       <emph>garments</emph> where shall we look?</p>
                                 <p>"The clothing already sent the mission (which, thanks to the
                                    benevolent, has been ample for the purposes to which it has been
                                    appropriated.) has hitherto been restricted to the wants of the
                                    Indian children belonging to the family, except when some Indian
                                    hunter, having had good success, has been able to pawn a deer's
                                    skin, or beaver, or some wild meats, to purchase enough to cover
                                    his naked and perhaps dying woman or children.</p>
                                 <p>"The sisters of our mission have resolved to form themselves
                                    into a society, to be called the Oregon Female Benevolent
                                    Society, for the purpose of clothing the Indian females in this
                                    section of the country. Their intention is to improve one
                                    afternoon in a week in making dresses for this purpose, and they
                                    intend to continue so to do while they shall find in their
                                    possession the necessary materials. Being one of the numbers I
                                    have promised and resolved to supply them, even if my salary
                                    must be devoted to the object.</p>
                                 <p>"My dear friends, will you assist me? And will my female
                                    acquaintance join our society, and if they do not make clothing,
                                    give us cloth that we may be employed? I believe you will; the
                                    evidences I have before me of your liberality warrant me in
                                    indulging swell a faith. I am sure I need not <emph>urge</emph>
                                    you, (nor should there be longer delay in attempting so
                                    charitable a design, were you told by this people, as I have
                                    been on every occasion) when inviting them to attend our such

                                    afternoon of every week, my sisters and female friends in Saugus
                                    will be engaged to carry into effect the same design of

                     <p>Ruth Rover, feeling very sensibly the need of seeing the Indian women
                        clothed, and finding but little prospect of this being done by the mission,
                        for Mr. Lee did not approve of the Indians receiving much gratuitously, as
                        he thought it encouraged them in idleness, but whatever they would
                           <emph>work</emph> for he was pleased to have them receive, and
                           <emph>they,</emph> being so accustomed to habits of idleness and
                        deprivation, would not make an effort to obtain that of which they did not
                        know the advantages, and had never realized the comforts. Hence, Ruth
                        conceived the plan of <emph>giving,</emph> in the first place, dresses to
                        the native women, and believed that after they had worn them and been
                        accustomed to their benefits, they would afterwards <emph>make an
                           effort</emph> to obtain them, rather than to again be destitute. In this
                        she was not mistaken.</p>

                        in going to the lodges and telling the women the time had again come for
                        their meeting, and in seeing them, sometimes to the number of twenty or
                        twenty-five, sitting around the room, learning to make clothing for
                        themselves.</p>
                     <p>Ruth received, about this time, many letters from her friends at home, which
                        greatly comforted her mind. Some extracts will be made, merely to denote
                        their kindly feeling for and affection towards her. They say:</p>
                     <p>"Notwithstanding this is the holy Sabbath I cannot let it pass without
                        devoting a few moments to you. I cannot, should I attempt it, describe the
                        pleasure received on the receipt of your letters from St. Catharine's and
                        Sandwich Islands, and in learning you were well and so well contented with
                        your situation. You are probably now in Oregon, and removed from all your
                        relatives, you will, I am sure, suffer many moments in loneliness. Be
                        assured, you have become doubly dear to me from this consideration. Could I
                        pass over the mountains, occasionally, and spend a few hours with you to
                        relieve this sadness, and to cheer, also, my heart with your presence—but,
                        alas! 'tis useless to think of it. I can only <emph>write</emph> to you, and
                        I would I were better qualified for <emph>this</emph> duty—but knowing as I
                        do the goodness of your heart, I know you will excuse my <emph>poor</emph>
                        attempts I believe in my ardent affection for you, if I cannot, by many
                        flowers of speech, express it.</p>
                     <p>"You will doubtless perceive extracts in some of your letters published in
                        the papers. Were it possible for you to receive the interest a large portion
                        of christians take in the Oregon mission, and the eagerness and avidity with
                        which everything relating to that country is received, you would, I'm sure,
                        pardon us for suffering the extracts to be made. In this I hope you will
                        find some apology. In a conversation with Mr. Brown of "Zion's Herald," he
                        remarked: "The friends of missions give their money for their support, and
                        they have a right to know what becomes of it, hence the public expect to
                        receive some information from the missionaries themselves, and," he added,
                        "nothing would please editors of public journals better than to have letters
                        addressed to them personally, on these subjects."</p>
                     <p>"I was at home yesterday, and hoped that father had in some measure relented
                        his feelings towards you, but he said, "I would not write to her, were
                        twenty vessels to sail from here to-morrow."</p>
                     <p>"You may find you have neglected to provide yourself with many indispensable
                        articles, which you cannot obtain in Oregon. If such should be the case you
                        must not fail to inform us immediately of your wants, that they may be
                        supplied—for, rest assured that whatever you shall find yourself in need of,
                        by making it known to your friends here, shall be forthcoming as soon as may
                        be.</p>
                     <p>"Dear sister, could I but see you, if but for an hour, how it would gratify
                        me. But is not possible to describe the interest I feel for you in the step
                        you have taken. O! live for God, and God alone. Be an example of good works.
                        I know you will, and may the Lord bless you abundantly.</p>
                     <p>"We send you some articles you may need. Do take care of your health, and
                        inform us of whatever you want and we will take great pleasure in forwarding
                        them.</p>
                     <p>"I cannot tell you how much I wish to see you—much more than ever, since
                        receiving your letters.</p>
                     <p>"What can it be that distresses you? I thought it would make you happy to do
                        something for your fellow beings, for you always aimed at this. But you
                        still find troubles, it seems. O! remember this world is not to be our
                        abiding place forever. Look to the Lord—He is able to save. Do not expect
                        happiness in this life—look beyond this vale of tears. Think of your reward,
                        if you can be the means of saving any of the perishing heathen; if you can
                        be instrumental in saving one soul 'twill reward you for all you suffer
                        here. Labor and pray, and they take courage from the thought that heaven
                        will be your great reward.</p>
                     <p>"We want you to write something to the Sabbath school children in Saugus, I
                        know they would be much pleased. If you are in need of any articles you
                        cannot procure, let us know and they will forthcoming.</p>
                     <p>"By-the-bye, let me tell you that your friend D. 0—, is married, and has
                        named his daughter Ruth Rover. Mary Ann has been a short time on a visit to
                        her grand-pa's. She says she could not prevail on him to put as much as one
                        cent into her missionary box, for he said he had given his youngest
                        daughter, which he thought was more than any of us had done. I guess he had
                        forgotten he did not <emph>give</emph> you.</p>
                     <p>"Last Sabbath we had a collection taken up for the purpose of buying
                        sacramental vessels for Oregon. Forty-two dollars were raised almost without
                        effort, and there were but few members present. It gives me very sad
                        feelings every Sabbath morning to hear the bells ringing for church knowing
                        that you are so remote and so far deprived of the privileges that we enjoy.
                        It also pains me to think of the heathen who never heard the glad tidings of
                        salvation. O! sister, be not weary in well-doing, for in due time you shall
                        reap if you faint not. "Hope on, hope forever," and <q>

                        hear of your safe arrival in Oregon, and that you were so well pleased with
                        your voyage, and received so many kind attentions from those with whom you
                        sailed, as also from those with whom you sojourned in strange lands. We feel
                        ourselves to be under obligations to them.</p>
                     <p>"You will receive by the Fama, besides the letters, a box of articles we
                        thought you might need. Be assured they come from warm and loving hearts; I
                        let me tell you now, that whatever I want from here, if you will but furnish
                        a memorandum, we will take great pleasure in forwarding them to you. In the
                        selection of the articles we have sent, we were of course guided by our own
                        judgement, fearing at the same time there might have been other things which
                        you would greatly prefer, but, such as they are, we beg you to accept them
                        as tokens of our regard."</p>
                     <p>One of Ruth Rover's sisters it had been impracticable for her to see, to bid
                        her a last adieu, on her leaving for the Oregon. She writes thus:</p>

                                    heart-achings and anxious hours I have spent on account of your
                                    going away without bidding me a last farewell.</p>
                                 <p>"I did not receive intelligence of your leaving till the last
                                    evening before you were to sail, and then my babe was quite sick
                                    which prevented me from travelling to Boston next day to see
                                    you, although it was supposed I could not reach there before the
                                    vessel would have sailed. Be assured I love you sincerely, and
                                    would walk many miles even at this late hour of the night if I
                                    could but have the pleasure of an interview with you; but when I
                                    think of the distance between us I wonder if we shall ever meet
                                    again in this world.</p>
                                 <p>"O! Ruth, can it be that we never shall see each other again
                                    here? Little did I think of it the last time I saw you at home.
                                    But I hear you are happy, and why should I not be resigned?</p>
                                 <p>"Brother S— brought down all your letters and I sat up nearly
                                    all night reading them. Sometimes I laughed at your nonsense,
                                    and then wept because of your sorrows, but on the whole I found
                                    the letters very interesting.</p>
                                 <p>"Your friends here all send love. E. G— is going to school in
                                    Ipswich. She always inquires about you in her letters—says she
                                    thinks you must be very sad and lonely in that far off land,
                                    among strangers and heathen.</p>

                                    that far off land. If you could not be happy without going, and
                                    felt it to be your indispensable duty to go, now do feel it to
                                    be your duty to return, and we will not blame you in the
                                    least.</p>

                                 <p>These few extracts will show that Ruth, in the midst of her
                                    trials and deprivations, was favored occasionally with evidences
                                    of the affectionate remembrance of her friends—her oldest
                                    brother, particularly, was never tiring in his kind services in
                                    obtaining letters for her, and rendering her every possible
                                    service.</p>
                                 <p>He had experienced great affliction in his family relations. In
                                    Illinois he had buried the wife of his youth and several
                                    children. He had been sceptical on the subject of religion, till
                                    his second marriage.</p>

                                 <p>* * * "Let me help you now, dear sister, to a small dish of
                                    matrimonial matters. You will remember our last conversation on
                                    the subject, and your advice to me.</p>
                                 <p>"Well, after waiting for some time, I called on Miss — for a
                                    definite answer. Her reply was that my 'hopes were vain,' which
                                    you may well suppose threw the business all aback in that
                                    quarter.</p>
                                 <p>"Shortly after, I am happy to inform you, I was introduced to
                                    Mrs. T—, the lady you have heard me speak of—waited on her to
                                    church—'popped the question,' and was married on Sabbath morning
                                    following, by Mr. M—.</p>
                                 <p>"Now, although I do abominably detest to hear a man praise his
                                    wife, I will venture this time to give you a little of my
                                    opinion of my better half. It is a God's truth that no man
                                    living ever was more supremely blest in a companion than myself.
                                    I have thus far found T— possessed of the most amiable
                                    disposition of any person with whom it has been my fortune to
                                    meet. She is kind, loving and affectionate, not only to myself,
                                    but to all around her. In her domestic affairs, prudent, frugal
                                    and economical, and unceasing and untiring in her endeavors to
                                    please. To sum up all, she is everything a reasonable man could
                                    wish—much better far than I deserve. I have been wonderfully
                                    blest, indeed, and my friends I believe, without an exception,
                                    consider I have been remarkably fortunate.</p>
                                 <p>"It no doubt will rejoice you much, my dear Ruth, to learn that
                                    my views in relation to things of a divine nature have very
                                    materially changed since I last wrote you; and when you are
                                    assured that this change was effected through the
                                    instrumentality of my dear wife, it will, I'm sure, cause you to
                                    love her till your latest breath.</p>

                        difficulties with Mr. Leland, I find myself, in a great measure, unqualified
                        for the duties of the school. My mind is depressed, and my bodily health is
                        feeble. During this season of trial I have felt the influence of the Spirit
                        of Grace in a very consoling manner, and I was satisfied of sharing the
                        approbation of heaven, until I so submissively a suffered the affair to
                        rest.</p>

                        and could they in any way be removed I should be most happy. Our late
                        troubles and conversations with him have had the effect to impress them more
                        fully upon my mind. O! that the way of duty were plainly before me, how
                        gladly would I walk it!</p>
                     <p>"Have been greatly afflicted in mind. Meditating on my situation at this
                        great distance from my home and friends, who have known me from my youth,
                        and were thereby enabled to judge favorably of my disposition—the treatment
                        I have received from the mission family, (whether it were good or bad
                        doubtless had better be decided by others,) and the dark prospect before me,
                        and the fact that the board at New York have not sent me an appointment, as
                        I was led to expect, I became so far discouraged that I felt compelled to
                        inform Mr. Shepherd that I must resign the school for a time, for I had
                        'that to trouble which my nature would not bear and leave me qualified for
                        the undertaking.' Mr. Lee visited me, and wished me to engage to keep the
                        school till his return from the United States, which will be probably in
                        about two years. I told him I would keep the school till he should leave,
                        but I could not engage to keep it till his return, for I did not know what
                        change might take place before that time, but for a little while I would go
                        to Vancouver, and after that I would decide on my course.</p>

                        with them as well as I was able in jargon. It has been customary, it
                        appears, for these servants of the Hudson Bay Company, who are mostly
                        Frenchmen, on settling here, to buy wives of the Indians, and for whom they
                        pay a blanket, a musket, a horse, or more or less, accordingly as she is
                        prized by her relatives, and with them they live in apparent tranquility

                        could perform the ceremony till quite recently. These wives and mothers
                        appear to be attached to their husbands and children, and I have known some
                        parents who have raised children to maturity before an opportunity presented
                        for them to be married. These people appear to consider the private contract
                        they have made is equally binding as if it had been sanctioned by a ceremony
                        of law.</p>
                     <p>"In one house was an exceedingly old woman wrapped in skins and making
                        moccasins. She was so decrepit with age that she could hardly direct the awl
                        and thread. After some little conversation with her, I asked her if she
                        considered that her life could not be continued to her much longer. She said
                        'yes,' and she 'must make haste and get the shoes done,' which excited a
                        laugh in the children and herself. I asked her if her heart was good, and
                        she replied, 'truly it is,' which is the answer ever ready with this
                        people.</p>
                     <p>"Another woman almost dead with consumption was fancifully trimming a dress
                        with different colored ribbons! Stepping into the grave, yet playing with
                        children's toys. She acknowledged that this world, where people are sick and
                        dying, is not good, and appeared pleased to hear that there is a place above
                        where sickness never comes, but said she never prays. Poor woman! she knows
                        not what it is to pray.</p>

                        slandered and neglected by my relations in the church—dependent upon

                        what I have done, for, verily, I have formerly not only 'watered my couch
                        with tears,' but in school I have been unable to keep my cheeks and eyes
                        dry, much to the astonishment of the children and my own mortification. Am I
                        not now sensitive, or am I becoming hardened to sorrow so that I find it of
                        no use to always grieve about these things?</p>
                     <p>"Rev. Mr. Leland arrived here from Willamette. He is very desirous for me to

                        make me comfortable—which certainly is very kind. He says also, if I choose,
                        I can have accommodations in Mr. Shepherd's family, who have commenced
                        keeping house by themselves.</p>

                        about two years since departed into the joy of her Lord. It is not
                        infrequently the case, when I go to rest with my thoughts depressed, that
                        her spirit seems to be hovering around me, and I awake in the morning in a

                        has been beaming from her countenance all day—to-night she is in tears. I
                        could not but ask myself why I should mourn at the ill fortune of my life,
                        because I have not in possession an equal share of the blessings of
                        friendship and society with others, and felt to take shame to myself that I
                        ever grieved for these things, and in prayer again found my mind refreshed
                        and strengthened to endure still these deprivations. On kneeling, the sweet
                        reflection of the privilege I enjoy in being permitted to go to a Throne of
                        Grace, and ask Him who sitteth thereon for needed blessings, almost for a
                        time overwhelmed me. Can I tell my wants to a being who is omnipotent in
                        power to perform, and whose willingness to bestow exceeds our most enlarged
                        conceptions and shall I talk of deprivations? What is there that He is
                        willing to bestow, which I may not receive? The difficulty lies here: I have
                        a will of my own, and do not at all times cheerfully say, '<emph>Thy</emph>
                        will be done.'</p>
                     <p>"This morning called on Mr. Douglass to enquire if it would be agreeable to
                        him for me to attempt to instruct the Indian children about the fort. He
                        said it would be pleasing to him, as well as a worthy undertaking to
                        instruct them, but there was no place in the fort which could be improved
                        for that purpose, as the only school-room was occupied by the boys. He said,
                        however, if it would be agreeable to me, he would give me a class of ladies
                        to instruct, in which was included his wife and Mrs. R—. I regret that I
                        cannot be benefitting the Indians, yet I may thus find employment sufficient
                        to defray the expense of my board. For this I would be thankful. I learned
                        from him that Mr. Lee, in speaking about me to him, said he 'had offered me
                        permanent employment at the mission and that I did not see fit to accept it,
                        and that he did not know whether or not I intended to leave the mission—if I
                        did he knew of not the reason for it.' This very much astonished me, though
                        it is true he wished me to make an engagement to remain a teacher in the
                        mission until his return from the States, which I objected to do as I did
                        not know what change might take place before that time—but that he knows the
                        reasons of my dissatisfaction in the mission, and of my leaving it, if I
                        should, I am well aware.</p>
                     <p>"Yesterday a company of Chenooks arrived to visit their friends here, and
                        tonight they are all singing in their native wild airs and beating an
                        accompaniment on boards and kettles. I very much admire to hear their native
                        airs in the open grove. There is, indeed, sublimity in the sound. They
                        generally sing on two, and sometimes on three different octaves, and I have
                        never been able to detect any accompaniment of words. Mrs. McLaughlin has
                        told me they have a song which they sing when dancing, which in purport is:
                        'I am acquainted with all the hills and mountains and streams, and every
                        place birds even see there have I been.' I think unless they improve they'll
                        not soon gain the 'laurel.'</p>

                        little girls belonging to the fort. I instructed the same also on the
                        Sabbath, before and after service, at church. For want of question books,
                        could exercise the scholars only in singing, reading, and reciting hymns and
                        portions of scripture. In the evenings show the girls how to arrange the
                        patchwork. These children are between the ages of seven and fourteen years,
                        and for want of mothers and sisters really appear as sheep without a
                        shepherd. They are daughters of gentlemen who are residing mostly at remote
                        stations of the company, and are here for purposes of security and to obtain
                        instruction.</p>

                        cheerful and to render others so, invited the ladies of the house, and the
                        girls, to a walk to the old fort, and a cup of tea on the grass. The day has

                        themselves by throwing and catching the stick and sign, in which I had to
                        join, though a new play to me—but as they engaged to learn me, I concluded
                        the fault would be theirs in case I made any blunders, and was presently as
                        wild as any of them. But I was soon cured of this <choice>

                        the tall green firs, as they contrasted with the blue sky and white clouds,
                        I became forcibly impressed with the beauty of the scene—the stillness,
                        purity, grandeur and glory of the works of God, and especially when
                        contrasted with the works of man—and preferred much to leave the party to
                        their sports, while I had found what yielded more satisfaction, in
                        meditation on the works of God. Messrs. Rae &amp; M'Cloud's boat being seen
                        descending the river increased the hilarity of the moment and hastened us to
                        the fort. Gathered some beautiful wild flowers, and found ourselves very
                        much refreshed.</p>
                     <p>"To-day and last night enjoyed an unusual sense of the blessings of the good
                        spirit of God upon my heart. Destitute of the society of relations, and
                        indeed almost of everyone with whom social intercourse is interesting, I yet
                        mourn not much, for I am comforted with the thought that I shall, when done
                        with earth, live again in the blessed enjoyment of the company of saints in
                        heaven. Latterly, the name of the Redeemer spoken by any one has seemed to
                        touch a chord which has vibrated through my whole soul, so much am I
                        comforted with His presence.</p>
                     <p>"Last Sabbath, the Rev. Mr. Beaver of the Episcopalian church, contrary to
                        what he done since his residence in the place, deferred the morning service
                        until eleven o'clock, and previously in the morning assembled the girls in
                        his house for the reading of the scriptures. This was, without doubt, done
                        to prevent their meeting with me, after service, for Sabbath school.
                        Agreeably to Mr. Douglass' wish, I have several times sang hymns with them
                        that they might improve in singing, and have met them in the evening for
                        that purpose. When Mr. Beaver became acquainted with this, he requested the
                        girls to come to his house to read the scriptures in the evenings. This he
                        also did, I have been told, when Mrs. Spalding and Mrs. Whitman were once
                        here; and forbade the school-master to copy a hymn the ladies sung and which
                        the children wished to learn, and sent a letter to these ladies requesting
                        them to have nothing to do with the children. Mr. Beaver, I suppose,
                        considers the fort his parish, which is undoubtedly right—yet, he manifests
                        a spirit of disunion not becoming a servant of the Most High.</p>
                     <p>"My mind is exceedingly troubled in consequence of being unable to benefit
                        the Indians. When I consider that for eight years the predominant desire of
                        my heart has been to devote my life for the good of the heathen, and the
                        kindness of many christian friends in favoring me in the plan, and the money
                        which has been expended for me to gain a sufficiently thorough education and
                        to assist me to come among them, and that now, apparently, I must relinquish
                        the hope—for I see them every day thronging my path in the most degraded and
                        abject state imaginable, while I am unable to benefit them at all. I suffer
                        continually an intense pain and disquietude of soul which deprives me of all
                        satisfaction in every pursuit I can devise to improve my time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="i"/>Sabbath. "Walking out to-day I observed three Indians working
                        in their gardens. They promised to desist, when I told them impropriety of
                        working on this day.</p>
                     <p>"Been to ride with Dr. Tolmie to see the Indians' gardens in the lower
                        plains. These are the first attempts they have made at agriculture. In doing
                        this, this season, they have been assisted and instructed by this gentleman,
                        who may, with propriety, be styled the Indians' friend. The small
                        plantations were neatly fenced and planted with potatoes and peas. One old
                        man had prepared a large piece of ground for the reception of seed, but had
                        none to plant in it. Dr. Tolmie offered him and another Indian potatoes if
                        they would come to the fort for then.</p>
                     <p>"To-day was invited to see the Indian school, it being the Sabbath, but was
                        unable to enter the crowd of Indians about the door. I heard this gentleman
                        teaching them the Lord's Prayer. After that they sang a hymn. How melodious
                        is the sound of any one's voice when employed in soothing the afflicted, or
                        in instructing the ignorant!"</p>
                     <p>About this time Ruth received many letters form home, and friends in
                        different places, but before we refer of them we will close this chapter by
                        saying that Messrs. Leland and Shepherd went to Vancouver form Willamette to
                        endeavor to persuade her to return to that station, saying the board had
                        appointed her as a "teacher in the Oregon mission," and she, with revived
                        spirits, accompanied them.</p>

                     <p>WE find some letters written by Ruth to her parents and sisters when at
                        Vancouver, from which we make a few extracts. To one who had experienced
                        great family bereavements she says:</p>
                     <p>"I was greatly afflicted to receive intelligence of the death of your lovely
                        daughters—not so much for them as for yourself. Knowing as much of the
                        trials and sins of the world as I do, I am more inclined to rejoice than
                        sorrow, when one of its inhabitants escapes to bliss. Your babes were lovely
                        and blooming, and a very great addition to your domestic pleasures—they are
                        now in heaven, (such is our faith,) spotless before the throne of God, and
                        you, my dear sister, though greatly distressed at their loss, may be
                        comforted that their home is the family of angels, and so fully supplied is
                        our Father's store-house with blessings that they can never want. Rejoice,
                        my dear Olive, that our best Parent has so timely and well provided for your
                        tender off-spring, and be thankful. I rejoice that you find religion so
                        great a support, and thank you for the encouragement you have given me to be
                           <emph>'dauntless.'</emph> Take the same encouragement yourself, and let
                        us go forward."</p>
                     <p>To another sister she says:</p>
                     <p>"After the regret I felt at not seeing you and Fitz and leaving my father
                        better reconciled to the step I had taken, had subsided, I had a pleasant
                        voyage to the Sandwich Islands. The visit we made at St. Catharine's Island
                        was very pleasant. You must think it so when you consider the confinement on
                        board a vessel for so many days was quite novel to me, and we had just
                        passed through the most intense heat in the torrid zone, after having so
                        shortly before that been hugging my cloak about me to screen me from the
                        fierceness of the wintry blast. The shades of the orange and lemon trees and
                        the cool breezes from the mountains were delightfully agreeable. The fruits,
                        including the pine apple, berries, &amp;c., were very refreshing after so
                        many days confinement to salt provisions, and the interesting society of the
                        Portuguese peasants was very pleasant.</p>
                     <p>"At Callao I did not go on shore, but from Mr. Leland's description of the
                        place, and of Lima, the capital of Peru, I presume I should have been much
                        gratified. The people there, as well as at Valparaiso, and indeed nearly
                        every town in South America, are strictly Roman Catholics. No other religion
                        is tolerated. At Valparaiso Mrs. Scott told me that the few foreigners there
                        who are protestants, were obliged to hold their religious meetings privately
                        or be dealt with according to law.</p>
                     <p>"In all these places the poor are wretched, and the rich glutting in luxury
                        and ease. The middle class alone appear happy.</p>
                     <p>"I think I have spoken of Valparaiso in another letter, but to the Sandwich
                        Islands I may again revert. I can never be weary of thinking and speaking of
                        our dear friends there. We found their society remarkably agreeable, and
                        received from the missionaries and residents every possible necessary and
                        refined attention.</p>
                     <p>"After a detention of fourteen days in this agreeable place and society,
                        which passed like an hour in a summer's eve; we took passage for Columbia
                        river, where we arrived after a passage of twenty-three days.</p>
                     <p>"I was pleased with Bro. S—'s choice of a wife, as far as I am acquainted
                        with it, and hope she may daily appear to him more exemplary as a christian
                        and endearing as a wife.</p>
                     <p>"You speak of E—'s disappointment, and I am only surprised that her
                        excellent qualities had not <choice>
                           <sic>irresitibly</sic>
                           <corr>irresistibly</corr>
                        </choice> bound Henry to her forever. I long since learned that an aspiring
                        young man would not be governed in his choice of a wife by considerations of
                        duty to her or her friends.</p>
                     <p>"I thank you, dear sister, for the affection you express—I am, as you know,
                        unworthy of it, (would I were worthy,)—but do not already urge my return
                        home—I have not yet, as I understand it, <emph>commenced</emph> my labors in
                        the mission field. There are four years more which I have to remain, and
                        before they'll be past you'll be tired of your endeavors.</p>
                     <p>"In the different letters I learn much that is discouraging concerning our
                        father's health, and I fear the next letters from home will apprise me of
                        his death. I am pained deeply in the remembrance of the last view I had of
                        him—how he hung his head—how the tears stole in silence between the long
                        seen furrows—how sad and strange his countenance when he refused to look at
                        or speak to me—but he is my father, and I mourn over him with all the
                        affection and fond remembrance with which I was ever possessed."</p>

                                    labors, and though separate from you, I unite with you in

                                    peculiar interest, for I have but little doubt we were

                                    letter, which came to hand December 11th. I think you must have
                                    thought mine to you was in some respects quite foreign to the
                                    good work in which we are engaged. I only intended it for a
                                    little note, and did not think it would be so long in finding<pb
                                       n="68-69" xml:id="VAC5702-00000035"/> its way to you, or
                                    travel so many miles ere it reached you—but as it has faithfully
                                    sought out an old friend, and procured for me a new
                                    correspondent in the dark but dewy vales of Oregon, I will be
                                    thankful, and no longer think of its deformities.</p>
                                 <p>"When we were in Wilbraham together, did you think of coming to
                                    these ends of the earth? I did not think of coming to these
                                    Islands, though my mind was on a foreign mission for sometime in
                                    the future. It was little more than six months after I left
                                    school that I decided to come here, and perhaps my memory can
                                    never revert to a more dreary season in the whole course of my
                                    life. My temporal circumstances were of a nature and tendency to
                                    greatly depress my spirits, which brought with it also leanness
                                    of soul and only gave me 'tears for meat continually.' But at
                                    length light sprang up out of obscurity and my feet were set in
                                    a large place, the Lord having hearkened unto me. O! how blessed
                                    is Christ's deliverance! If we hold our confidence in Him it
                                    brings us great reward. He is ever nearer us than we sometimes
                                    imagine.</p>
                                 <p>"My family cares have increased so much the past year that I
                                    cannot now do anything in school—but I do not think it possible
                                    for the wife of a missionary to reside in the midst of a heathen
                                    population and guide her house in the fear of the Lord, without
                                    exerting a good influence upon the people, especially upon the
                                    mothers, to whom it is given to mould the characters of the
                                    succeeding generation. We have doubtless both of us learned
                                    enough of missionary life to find that we did not leave all our
                                    spiritual enemies in our native land, and that their strength is
                                    not a whit diminished from the fact that we are missionaries. It
                                    appears to me that till since I have been here I did not know
                                    how much of the corrupt nature my heart contained, nor do I now
                                    know, but can most emphatically exclaim: 'Who shall deliver me
                                    from this body of sin and death?'</p>
                                 <p>"How do you enjoy your health in Oregon? How large a school do
                                    you teach? and how do you proceed in discipline? Is the language
                                    difficult to acquire? Are the people kind to you? Do their
                                    habits and course of life manifest as much ignorance,
                                    degradation and misery as you expected? Have the mission, at
                                    this early period, comfortable accommodations to make it seem
                                    like home? How is the surrounding scenery? Is the soil
                                    productive of the same kinds of fruits, flowers, &amp;c., as in
                                    our loved States? What are the tastes of the Indians for
                                    cultivation? What their habits of labor? What their personal
                                    appearance? How many hopeful converts as fruits of the mission's
                                    enterprise? How do they wear? Can you not, in your next, give me
                                    sonic anecdotes illustrative of these questions?</p>
                                 <p>"Will you not write soon, fully and frankly, your feelings, your
                                    joys and sorrows and trials, consequent upon a missionary life,
                                    &amp;c., for anything which will be of importance to you will be
                                    of interest to me. Pray for the peace of Zion here.</p>

                                 <p>"MY DEAR SISTER ROVER: I think I need make no apology for
                                    writing to you, as I have a good opportunity to send. It may
                                    serve to support and strengthen you in the midst of your arduous
                                    duties, in a far distant land, to know there are some in our own
                                    favored States that sympathise with you and remember you in
                                    their supplications before our Father in Heaven.</p>
                                 <p>"With pleasure memory often points to my mind the pleasant
                                    interviews we enjoyed together at Wilbraham in the fall of '35.
                                    Together we ascended the rugged hill of science, and in hours of
                                    relaxation from study we used to converse on the things of God
                                    and the interest we felt in the great work in which you are now
                                    engaged. But sweeter far were the seasons of social prayer we
                                    enjoyed when with united hearts and voices we poured out our
                                    supplications and praises to Him who hears and answers
                                    prayer.</p>
                                 <p>"Yes, dear sister, those are seasons on which I love to reflect,
                                    though mingled with sorrow at the thought that probably they
                                    will be renewed no more on earth. But there is a brighter,
                                    better world where I trust we shall again unite our voices in
                                    unceasing praise to Him who hath washed us front our sins in his
                                    own blood.</p>
                                 <p>"I was happy to learn that Oregon was to be the field of your
                                    labor, as you had expressed to me a desire that your might be
                                    sent there. And I have since then rejoiced to hear that you have
                                    been supported and strengthened by God's grace in the great
                                    work. Without doubt you have found many difficulties and trials
                                    in the way, of which you could form no adequate idea till you
                                    commenced your labors. But while you lean on the arm of
                                    Omnipotence you shall not, you need not fear, you will be
                                    sustained.</p>
                                 <p>"I have been attending camp-meeting the past week at Bolton. It
                                    was a season of profit—some were sanctified and some converted.
                                    Of this privilege I suppose you are deprived, but the time may
                                    come when in the grove with the sons of the forest you may
                                    worship God. O! how I should like to see and converse with you
                                    concerning your joys and sorrows. But this may not be on
                                    earth—but it will be but a little while before we shall close
                                    all our labors here and enter upon those joys that are abiding.
                                    It matters but little where our lot is cast on earth, if we can
                                    glorify God and make our election sure.</p>
                                 <p>"Perhaps, dear sister, you may see little fruit of your
                                    labor—you may meet with unkindness and ingratitude from those
                                    for whom you have forsaken all that is dear to you on earth. But
                                    remember your record is on high—your reward is in heaven. It was
                                    not for worldly honor that you engaged in the work, but to labor
                                    for God and the salvation of souls, therefore if God approves
                                    you can rejoice. Sometimes you may be ready to faint in the
                                    midst of the discouraging scenes that surround you—prejudices
                                    against the gospel and the white men may have grown with their
                                    growth and strengthened with their strength, until it seems to
                                    be an almost insurmountable barrier in the way of the spread of
                                    the gospel. But Jehovah has promised that his word shall not
                                    return to Him void—that the whole earth shall be filled with His
                                    glory, and He will accomplish it in His time.</p>
                                 <p>"I still love the missionary cause—I am willing to go to the
                                    ends of the earth if God calls. I am waiting the direction of
                                    His providence. Wherever I can be most useful I desire to be. I
                                    would like to know the portion of work assigned me and be about
                                    it.</p>
                                 <p>"I trust my soul is becoming more and more deeply acquainted
                                    with the mysteries of godliness. In Christ I possess all
                                    things—He is my all. O! the blessedness of that gospel that
                                    brings full salvation to the soul. What a privilege that worms
                                    of the dust may become heirs of God—heirs to an incorruptible
                                    crown. Is not this worth suffering for? and may we not rejoice
                                    that we are accounted worthy to suffer with Christ? for if we
                                    do, we shall reign with Him. Heaven will abundantly recompense
                                    our labor. Here we toil for a moment, but our rest will be
                                    eternal.</p>
                                 <p>"You have, I suppose, a few kind friends with whom you can hold
                                    sweet converse. These you must prize highly. But the best of all
                                    is, God is ever near. The blessed Jesus sympathizes with his
                                    followers—having suffered in the flesh he knows our infirmities,
                                    and His grace will be sufficient.</p>
                                 <p>"Let this, my dear sister, cheer and comfort your heart in the
                                    midst of your sufferings. Be not discouraged at the difficulties
                                    in the way. You are not alone—underneath you are laid the
                                    everlasting arms. Labor and suffer on a few more days or years,
                                    and then thy warfare will be ended, 'the toilsome strife will be
                                    o'er, and thou shalt hear the welcome sound: 'It is enough, come
                                    up higher.' I too will strive to meet you in that better
                                    land.</p>
                                 <p>"Many of our dear friends with whom we associated at Wilbraham
                                    have gone to rest. I know not where I shall spend my days on
                                    earth. But, whether it be in our own favored New England, the
                                    islands of the sea, or the wild forests of Oregon,<pb n="70-71"

                                    happy.</p>

                                 <p>"My DEAR SISTER RUTH—It is with a heart overflowing with emotion
                                    that I have taken my pen to address you.</p>
                                 <p>"The thought that you, with whom I have formed a pleasing and
                                    endearing acquaintance, and who was with me but yesterday, as it
                                    were, are now so far from me, and that I may not indulge the
                                    hope of seeing you again, almost overwhelms me.</p>
                                 <p>"Yes, sister, the very lines which I here pen for your perusal
                                    cannot reach you for many months, and probably not until after
                                    many more changes shall have occurred.</p>
                                 <p>"I often think of you and imagine I can see you engaged in the
                                    arduous labors incident to the missionary life, and sometimes
                                    say to myself, O! that I were with Ruth, engaged in teaching the
                                    poor degraded Indian. We occasionally hear from you by way of
                                    your letters addressed to your friends and which have been
                                    published, and I assure you it is with eagerness that I have
                                    perused them. The name of Ruth is dear to me, and every line,
                                    however small, penned by your hand, deeply interests me. The
                                    intelligence of your illness has been a source of affliction to
                                    us, but we hope that ere this you have been restored to perfect
                                    health.</p>
                                 <p>"You have the consolation of knowing that you are spending your
                                    strength for the advancement of the Redeemer's cause and, that
                                    He who called you is able to carry you through the last
                                    conflict.</p>
                                 <p>"We are this day to give the parting hand to some very dear
                                    friends whom we meet no more on earth. It will cost us a
                                    struggle, but we will be reconciled to the will of God, hoping
                                    that though we see them no more here, we shall meet them at the
                                    right hand of God. O! consoling thought! Does not this cheer
                                    you, my dear Ruth? The consideration that these trials are but
                                    for a moment, and that you are (if faithful to the grace given)
                                    to enjoy the society of your friends in your Father's kingdom,
                                    does it not cast the light of sunshine over your darkest
                                    trials?</p>
                                 <p>"My mother and sisters often think and speak of you with much
                                    affection. While we enjoy all the privileges which you have
                                    sacrificed for the good of the heathen, think not that we are
                                    unmindful of you.</p>
                                 <p>"That the Lord may sustain you and make you abundantly useful in
                                    your capacity, and that you may be prepared for a triumphant
                                    entrance into the kingdom of rest, is the prayer of</p>

                                 <p>"DEAR MISS ROVER: "I was glad to hear from you, but sorry to
                                    know that you were suffering from sickness.</p>
                                 <p>"We are often led by a path we know not, but generally find in
                                    the end it was just the discipline we needed. When we possess
                                    that meek and humble spirit which will lead us, without anxious
                                    solicitude to commit our way unto the Lord, and trust also in
                                    Him that He may bring to pass the desires of our hearts, it
                                    matters little to us whether it be by labor or suffering that we
                                    are called to serve Him.</p>
                                 <p>"I wanted to know a little more particularly how you live, what
                                    comforts you are deprived of, how your time is employed, how you
                                    succeed in the language, what you can do to benefit the natives
                                    with your present knowledge of it, &amp;c. Suppose you give me
                                    the history of a week, in short, with its duties, its trials,
                                    perplexities, labors, discouragements, etc.</p>
                                 <p>"Cast <emph>all</emph> your care upon God, and it is doubtless
                                    true that when you have done this you will go from the throne of
                                    grace with a light heart. You will not carry away the burden you
                                    brought there. Are you growing in all the graces of the spirit?
                                    Do you find it as easy as you expected to live like a follower
                                    of Jesus on missionary ground? Have you all that ardor of
                                    feeling and warmth of love which you anticipated? Do you feel as
                                    deeply and constantly for the perishing multitudes about you as
                                    you thought you should?</p>
                                 <p>"You spoke of trials, but did not tell me of what nature they
                                    are, so that I cannot either sympathize with you or tender you a
                                    word of council or admonition. I know that when here you was
                                    laboring with some spiritual trials, and that on other points
                                    you were not quite happy. I can only say to you, trust in the
                                    Lord, wait patiently for Him and He will bring you out of
                                    affliction, if it be what he visits upon you, with increased
                                    light and love.</p>
                                 <p>"My own course has been marked with some trials, though probably
                                    had I exercised, as I ought, the meek and quiet graces of the
                                    gospel of Christ they might have been spared me. I ought, then,
                                    to learn a lesson of wisdom and forbearance towards those who
                                    are similarly tempted.</p>

                                 <p>"DEAR CHRISTIAN FRIEND—Mrs. Whitman has kindly invited me to
                                    answer the letter she was happy to receive from you a short time
                                    since, as she is unable at this time to answer it herself, owing
                                    to her little daughter's illness and other duties which demand
                                    her time. This must answer as an apology, if one be needed, for
                                    missionary sisters unacquainted to write to each other.</p>
                                 <p>"I have often heard Mr. and Mrs. Whitman speak with interest of
                                    the brethren and sisters of your station. Your names hare
                                    already become very familiar to me, and I almost forget that we
                                    are strangers. But if strangers to each other in person, I trust
                                    we are not in heart. Our united prayers for each other have
                                    doubtless often ascended, to the mercy seat. O! may they
                                    continue to rise as one unbroken cloud of incense, and ere long
                                    blessings will descend upon us. Prayer is a link that will bind
                                    christian hearts together. 'Tis also a proof of christian
                                    love.</p>
                                 <p>"We, dear friend, have each of us left our home and country for
                                    the purpose of lending our feeble aid to advance the cause of
                                    Christ in this dark portion of the world. O! let us consider the
                                    responsibility resting on us, and endeavor to be faithful in our
                                    Master's cause. Ours is a privilege denied to many who would
                                    gladly engage in this blessed work. 'Tis a privilege that angels
                                    might envy, could envy enter heaven.</p>
                                 <p>"As yet I have learned but little of the language of this
                                    people—hope, however, to be able to converse with them soon.
                                    Have made some attempts at teaching the children English, but
                                    have almost done with it, as there are few here now. It is
                                    thought best to teach the native language as soon as possible.
                                    We feel that it must take much time and immense labor to teach
                                    them the English, although that would be desirable, as it would
                                    introduce them into a wide field of useful knowledge. If duty
                                    seems to demand it we shall teach them the English hereafter. As
                                    yet we can see nothing to discourage us in our work. I think our
                                    expectations have been realized. We find this an interesting
                                    people, anxious to receive instruction, and, as far as we can
                                    see their prejudices are in favor of religion.</p>
                                 <p>"There seems to be wanting but faith and prayer, together with
                                    the means appointed, to secure a blessing. We believe that God
                                    has designs of mercy towards these Indian tribes, and that ere
                                    long they will become his peculiar people. O! my friend, will
                                    not the joy of introducing to the heavenly world some of these
                                    benighted tribes more that reward us for all our toil and
                                    suffering? Let us then engage in our work with ardor, knowing
                                    that the time is short. Let us labor—forgetting ourselves—not
                                    seeking our own enjoyment—knowing our reward is in heaven.</p>
                                 <p>"Should our lives be spared, we may have the happiness of
                                    meeting each other and conversing and sympathizing together.
                                    Till then—I shall be happy of the privilege of corresponding

                     <p>Lest we tire our readers with a sameness of subject we will defer remaining
                        letters of this description for another place and refer to those which
                        produced in Ruth Rover's mind feelings of a very painful kind.</p>
                     <p>The death of her father took place in one year and two days after she left
                        home. It is thus referred to:</p>
                     <p>"DEAR SISTER RUTH—It gives me pleasure to have another opportunity to write,
                        although a part of what I shall communicate will be of the most distressing
                        character.</p>
                     <p>"I allude to the death of our dear father, who departed this life January
                        29th, 1838, after being confined to his bed but three weeks, although he has
                        been quite poorly for some months. He was quite resigned latterly, and very
                        patient under his sufferings. The Rev. Mr. W— visited him daily for some
                        time and prayed with him, and he took much pleasure in having christian
                        people call on him and converse on things of a divine and heavenly nature.
                        From prayer he seemed to derive great consolation, and those best qualified
                        to judge are of an opinion that he met with a change of heart and died
                        happy. His disease, on post mortem examination, was found to be cancer in
                        the stomach and ulcerated liver."</p>
                     <p>A sister says:</p>
                     <p>"DEAR RUTH: It becomes my painful duty to inform you of the death of our
                        father. * * * * * *</p>
                     <p>"I was not with him in his last moments, but he died without a struggle.
                        When I saw him last I went to his bedside and gave him a parting kiss. He
                        returned it and said, 'we must part—you must do the best you can—I shall
                        live but a short time, I do not wish to—I have given all to God—to God I
                        have given all.' Gladly would I have stayed with him till he breathed his
                        last, but I thought of the dying groan which I had so recently witnessed in
                        my own house, and felt it would be too much to hear.</p>
                     <p>"Mother bears her trouble with great fortitude."</p>
                     <p>"I wished to speak to father of you, but feared it would too much disturb
                        his feelings to refer to your absence, therefore I said nothing.</p>
                     <p>"I suppose S— has told you how he made his will, if so you will perceive he
                        has kept his word about disinheriting you. But I cannot think it was from
                        any hardness towards you, but in consequence of his disappointment and from
                        having passed his word to you to that effect, and also because you are so
                        far away he thought you would never be benefitted if he willed you
                        anything.</p>
                     <p>"But, sister, you have much to comfort you. The bible says, 'when thy father
                        and mother forsake thee, then the Lord will take thee up.' You have, I
                        trust, a rich treasure laid up in heaven. Christ says, 'no man that has
                        forsaken father, mother, houses, lands, &amp;c., &amp;c., but shall receive
                        in the world to come eternal life.'"</p>
                     <p>We perceive here that Ruth's sister omitted a part of the promise, viz: that
                        which refers to possessions in this life. Did her faith fail her because
                        Ruth received nothing from her father? and did she think that God
                        consequently would be only half as good as His word?</p>
                     <p>Another sister says of this event:</p>
                     <p>"We have lost our poor old father. O! could you have been here and waited on
                        him in his last moments 'twould have been such a consolation to him. We all
                        feared to speak of you to him, and he only once during his illness spoke of
                        you to any one. When I bade him farewell the last time, hoping to see him
                        again before he should die, he said no! he should not live to see me again,
                        and bursting into to tears said it was hard that all his children must leave
                        him, and exclaimed with much feeling, 'Now is the time that I want Ruth!' O!
                        sister, could it have been ordered that you had not gone till after this
                        event, what a satisfaction to us all, and especially to him, and I <choice>
                           <sic>belive</sic>
                           <corr>believe</corr>
                        </choice> also to you, since it proves that he is called away so much
                        earlier than you expected. But try to be resigned.</p>
                     <p>"I believe <emph>you</emph> will suffer more than us all by this
                        dispensation. <emph>We</emph> are in the midst of the pleasures of home,
                        friends and social advantages but you—oh! it chills me to think of what may
                        be your deprivations. Do not—do not think of remaining there: <q>
                           <lg type="stanza">
                              <l>"Come home! thy earthly friends with sorrow, see</l>
                              <l>The vacant chair that waits so long for thee;</l>
                              <l>Wand'rer return—return no more to roam—</l>
                              <l>Come back to thy native land! Come home!</l>
                              <l>Come home!'"</l>
                           </lg>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>By Mr. Rover's will, the widow was to receive her third of all the property.
                        Ruth and two brothers, in consequence of their having left home without
                        their father's consent—they to the western country, and she to a foreign
                        mission—were to receive each <emph>one dollar</emph>, the law making it
                        necessary each child should receive this sum. The youngest son was to
                        receive fifty dollars, having been undutiful and the balance, three thousand
                        eight hundred dollars, to be equally divided among the remaining four
                        children.</p>
                     <p>Ruth's brother added:</p>
                     <p>"The grave stones have been lately placed at the grave, which is the last we
                        can do for our departed parent. We send his portrait to you, thinking you
                        will prize it much as well as ourselves, for, taking all things into
                        consideration, we concluded we could not do otherwise."</p>
                     <p>We will here add, as still further indications of Ruth's feelings on her
                        error in leaving her father contrary to his will, and her regret for his
                        death, the following, written in August, 1841:</p>

                     <p>WHEN Ruth Rover arrived at the mission in Willamette, she enquired for her
                        "appointment," and learned that no one had received any intimation of one
                        having been made for her, only by what had been gathered from the missionary
                        report of the Oregon Mission, viz: that "Miss Ruth Rover, a pious young
                        lady, had been sent by the board as a teacher to the Oregon Mission."</p>
                     <p>There did always appear something strange about this, especially as her
                        brother had written to this effect:</p>
                     <p>"The Rev. Mr. Pierce seemed to regret that you did not send your compliments
                        more particularly to him than you did. He says his efforts and exertions to
                        procure you a good situation, and to render you as comfortable as possible,
                        were as unremitting as any persons could well be, and that since you left he
                        has been continually engaged in your behalf, and did not relax his exertions
                        until he succeeded in <emph>procuring for you the appointment</emph> you
                        have so long sought <emph>as a teacher</emph>, and that it was chiefly, if
                        not altogether, through his instrumentality that you, received it at all.
                        Considering these circumstances, he was in hopes you had not so soon
                        forgotten him."</p>
                     <p>What became of that appointment, if the board ever sent it to Ruth? She
                        never received it!</p>
                     <p>Perhaps there never was a mission organised and established which excited so
                        deep and general an interest in the christian world as the Oregon Mission;
                        and perhaps none other ever received such large and voluntary contributions
                        for its support, as this; and perhaps none other ever receive such large and
                        ready acquisitions of missionaries; and perhaps no man ever bore the
                        responsibility of conducting such a plan in whom there was so general and
                        unbounded confidence placed as in the Rev. Jason Lee; and perhaps, too, no
                        mission ever existed which so fully disappointed the hopes of the church as
                        the Oregon Methodist Mission.</p>
                     <p>Of the interest felt in the United States for this mission, there need be no
                        proof produced. Every one who was there between the years of 1830 and 1840
                        must have become acquainted with the fact. This interest arose, in a great
                        measure perhaps, from the conviction that the aborigines of our country had
                        been wronged by the white man, and that in the remote and extensive country
                        of Oregon there was a vast opportunity presented for this injury to be
                        repaired. And the hope to repair this injury was encouraged by the
                        consideration that the Oregon tribes, being so remotely situated from the
                        communities of white men, there was little probability that avarice would
                        lead them, for many years, to endeavor to supplant the Indians and obtain
                        their lands, thus making it necessary for them to retire beyond the
                        influence of missionary operations.</p>
                     <p>To carry out this idea and obtain this object large, <emph>very
                           large,</emph> contributions were offered. Societies were formed in almost
                        every town and village to obtain more funds—while almost every little girl
                        and boy had a missionary box, into which the small sums given by parents and
                        friends for toys and sugar plums were dropped for the purpose of helping to
                        support the Oregon Mission. Many<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC5702-00000039"/> a
                        widow contributed her mite, which she herself needed more to replenish her
                        winter fire or to clothe herself more comfortably—and many a servant girl
                        gave of her hard earnings for this purpose. The seamstress resolved to take
                        another hour or two from those already too few for the proper restoration of
                        nature, in order to drop a dollar into the contribution box—and
                        washer-women, and nurses, and draymen, and wood-sawyers, all partook of the
                        general enthusiasm which was felt for this cause. And those who could not
                        give all they wished, in ready money, formed themselves into "Dorcas
                        Societies," to make up and furnish clothing, for the destitute Indians of
                        Oregon—contributing cloth, bed-linen, quilts, comforters, ready-made clothes
                        of every description, hose, shoes, yarn, thread, books. provisions, &amp;c.,
                        &amp;c., till the store-houses in Oregon were filled to overflowing with
                        these evidences of generosity and good will in the people of the United
                        States.</p>
                     <p>In addition to this, when Rev. J. Lee was in the United States in 1839, he
                        received funds and contributions to the amount of about forty thousand
                        dollars, (as informed by J. Peck, Lynn.) which he brought here with him.
                        There also came with him at that time a reinforcement of thirty-two persons,
                        whose passages around Cape Horn and outfits were paid by the people of the
                        States; and there had, before this, been added to the mission about nineteen
                        persons, whose expenses there had been borne, as well as those of the first
                        company—the Rev. Messrs. Lees, Shepherd, &amp;c.,—by the people of the
                        United States.</p>
                     <p>So great was the interest in favor of this mission, and "<emph>so sure the
                           support</emph>" offered the missionaries, as one expressed himself in our
                        hearing, that little delay was occasioned by waiting for volunteers to
                        secure its interests. An advertisement that men and women were wanted for
                        Oregon was readily responded to, and as the qualifications required were not
                        difficult to find, as thus: "Those who apply will recollect that they must
                        be recommended by the preacher in charge, for their piety and standing as
                        members of the church, and by at least three others for their competency in
                        that particular branch of mechanical labor in which they propose to engage,
                        signifying also their willingness to devote themselves exclusively to the
                        service of the missionary society for at least ten years, unless sooner
                        released by death or by the superintendent of the mission," many were almost
                        immediately on the spot. These qualifications may be easily found in persons
                        who are, nevertheless, totally unqualified for missionaries.</p>
                     <p>The Rev. Jason Lee was a <emph>good</emph> man, and possessed the true
                        missionary spirit. He was devotedly pious, ardent and dauntless, but
                        deficient in judgment; easily influenced by those whom he considered his
                        superiors, but obstinate and unyielding to his inferiors. His great <foreign
                           xml:lang="FRA">forte</foreign> was in talking. He could keep the whole
                        body of the people around him, listening to his conversation and waiting for
                        his nod, but he could not set them to work or decide on any work for himself
                        which gave him satisfaction. Hence, affairs at the mission were generally in
                        the condition he once said they were, and for which he could apply no
                        remedy: "When there was nobody here but Daniel and brother Shepherd and
                        myself there was some work done—when the first reinforcement came the work
                        began to cease, but when the <emph>last</emph> came everything came to a
                        dead stand."</p>
                     <p>The fact was, he could not with a glance see what should be done, and
                        resolve upon it. He had located the mission in a wrong place and was unable
                        to determine how to get out of it, and being too easily influenced by others
                        his mind was ever <choice>
                           <sic>vascillating</sic>
                           <corr>vacillating</corr>
                        </choice> and fluctuating. The wish to fulfill the intentions of the board,
                        and to perform his duty as a missionary, rendered him tardy in complying
                        with the wishes of the mission family—one of whom wanted a farm, another an
                        orchard, another a band of cattle, &amp;c., &amp;c; another could not go to
                        a remote station for he wanted his children schooled—another could not teach
                        school, for he must attend to his family—another could not build houses, for
                        he had a new plan in his head, he was going to study physic—and another
                        could not accept this or that appointment, for he had no wife—and another
                        could not leave his wife to do this or that, for he had no laundress!—and
                        thus the insufficient intellect of the good intentioned superintendent was
                        not found adequate to these pressing emergencies, and he resolved to go to
                        the board in New York for advice, and probably for more of the same
                        stamp.</p>
                     <p>This tardiness of operation, arose, too, perhaps, in consequence of his
                        entertaining so great a conscientiousness on the subject of
                           <emph>time</emph>, for while one said he must have cattle broken in, and
                        a farm and orchard in process of operation for the support of his increasing
                        family, Mr. Lee declared that he did not consider "<emph>the time in which
                           he wrote his letters home to be his own,</emph>" therefore
                           <emph>time</emph> was unimproved because belonging to no one.</p>
                     <p>Another error was apparent in the fact that while he was so scrupulous in
                        expending the mission funds that he would not give a carpenter one dollar
                        per day to build or improve houses for the accommodation of the families who
                        needed them, the mission carpenter was wasting his time in trying to devise
                        some plan which would justify him in wearing a black coat, instead of a
                        carpenter's apron.</p>
                     <p>Mismanagement and waste both operated to the ruin of the enterprise. There
                        was very little done because there were so few to labor—nobody labored
                        because the work belonged to no one.</p>
                     <p>Other causes there were which produced a more apparent effect. The wrong
                        locality of the mission operated eventually to its disbandment.</p>
                     <p>We have seen two reasons in print that were given by Mr. Lee which induced
                        him to commence his first operations in the heart of a Roman Catholic
                        settlement. One was that "having few agricultural implements, he felt
                        dependent on obtaining loans of others!" and he stated that they had
                        "selected the valley of the Willamette as the seat of their missionary
                        operations on account of its central relation to other eligible parts of the
                        Territory and peculiar advantages for agriculture. They moreover found it
                        occupied by small settlements of traders who had taken Indian wives and had
                        families growing up around them. Their moral habits were such as to corrupt
                        the Indians, and he concluded that their influence must be corrected before
                        any hope could be entertained of the conversion of the natives around them.
                        This was one of the principal motives for establishing the mission in their
                        vicinity."</p>
                     <p>We consider that <emph>these</emph> motives should not have influenced him,
                        for, in the first place, with such a generous sentiment in his favor as
                        affected the people of the States, he could have obtained agricultural
                        implements without <emph>borrowing</emph>, and there being abundant lands in
                        the vast Territory of Oregon, fit for agricultural purposes, besides this,
                        and tribes of Indians remote from all pernicious influence from white men,
                        he should not have located his mission in the midst of Romanists, whom he
                        might have known would exert what influence they possessed in favor of their
                        own religious tenets; and he might have known that wherever there were
                           <emph>catholics</emph> there would also be <emph>priests</emph>, and
                        consequently the religion of the <emph>heart</emph> would, by Indians, be
                        readily rejected for that of the <emph>head</emph>—consisting in outward
                        form, tinsel and ceremony.</p>
                     <p>It is a lamentable fact that not one of the Indians, half-breeds or whites,
                        who joined the mission church during the great revival of religion (to which
                        we will refer again) in 1839, or previously to that time, are now members of
                        the methodist church. <emph>Every</emph> half-breed or Indian child who was
                        then under the influence of that church, is now a Roman catholic! We believe
                        there is <emph>one</emph> exception. <emph>Angelica</emph> is not a
                        catholic, neither does she profess to enjoy religion.</p>
                     <p>After this digression, which may be regarded as <emph>one shade</emph> of
                        the "Pictures of Oregon," we will return to her who is more particularly the
                        subject of these pages.</p>
                     <p>On her return to the mission it was arranged that Ruth Rover should board
                        with Mrs. S—— and take charge of the Indian girls. This she did for a week,
                        when Mrs. Jason Lee died. The ladies of the family being in poor health,
                        Ruth at once gave her whole attention to perform<pb n="78-79"
                           xml:id="VAC5702-00000040"/> form whatever appeared necessary to be done
                        The evening before Mrs. Lee's death, she prepared for burial her little son,
                        and the next day, with some assistance, prepared also the person of Mrs. Lee
                        for the grave; then labored energetically to prepare the house for the
                        funeral, and after this restored to perfect order Mrs. Lee's wardrobe; and
                        then devoted herself to the care of the Indian girls, in which employment
                        she was very happy.</p>
                     <p>It was intended that the fourteen girls in her charge should be entirely
                        subject to her will, with the exception that they attended to Mr. S—'s
                        school. She wished to learn them much, and arranged her plan to have
                           <emph>one</emph> of them every week do the house work with her, in order
                        to learn the art, and the others to attend to sewing, knitting, &amp;c. She
                        had them wash their own clothes, always waiting till Wednesday that Mrs. S—
                        and the boys of the mission had each had a day for these purposes. After
                        school she allowed them to exercise in the open air, in walking, playing, or
                        in gathering berries; and in the evening she took her seat among them and
                        instructed them in dressing their dolls, in making patchwork, or in
                        explaining pictures in their books, or conversing or singing as they might
                        be disposed.</p>
                     <p>In the leisure time she could obtain on the Sabbath, after service in the
                        church and sabbath school, she spent some time with the Indians in their
                        lodges, in conversation, singing and prayer, and teaching them what she
                        could.</p>
                     <p>She also commenced to learn the Calapooyah language, and succeeded well till
                        she was interrupted by her labors being so increased at he mission as to
                        leave her little time, and by being told by Mr. Leslie that <emph>he</emph>
                        had been appointed missionary to the Calapooyahs, which she though was hint
                        enough to deter her from proceeding.</p>
                     <p>But these were employments and favors too great for Ruth to be allowed to
                        enjoy uninterruptedly. She soon discovered there was a spirit of
                        disaffection at work. Mr. S— wished the control of every affair connected
                        with the mission to be subjected entirely to him. Hence, if he wanted any
                        extra help on any occasion, he would direct whichever girl he pleased
                        perform it, without regard to any arrangement Ruth had made, and this soon
                        produced such disaffection among them that when she wished any service
                        performed, either for her good or their instruction, she would be denied by
                        them and be told that Mr. S— wanted them.</p>
                     <p>This soon was carried so far that she could gain no service from them
                        without insolent language, and finally she informed the superintendent that
                        she declined having any care of the girls of the mission unless she could
                        exercise authority over them. Mr. L. enquired into the case, and gave as his
                        decision that Ruth Rover had not done wrong in any particular, but that Mr.
                        S— had, and he should be subjected to censure.</p>
                     <p>It was again arranged that Ruth should take charge of the girls, and it was
                        thought there would be no occasion for Mr. S— to interfere at all, as he had
                        been permitted to choose from among them any two additional servants he
                        chose for Mrs. S—' s service, and he had already the control of the whole
                        number of the boys. Bur this resulted in no better success, for they had
                        learned what was most agreeable to Mr. S— and for him they had a particular
                        regard, as he had sought them out among the natives and brought them there,
                        and hence to do as they pleased and as would please him was their principal
                        object. And on one occasion, when Ruth was trying to enforce obedience, he
                        interfered, and attempting to take the child from her hands in some way
                        caused an injury to her person, which led her to lay another complaint
                        before the superintendent, which resulted in the decision of the members of
                        the mission that "Mr. S— had been guilty of abuse of the character (by
                        abusing her before strangers) and person of Ruth Rover, and shall be
                        subjected to the reproof from the superintendent of this mission."</p>
                     <p>At the same time, it was thought by some that Ruth had not yielded the child
                        to Mr. S— as readily as she might or should have done, and requested that
                        she should receive some reproof also—probably somewhat to mollify his
                        feelings—and she was waited on accordingly, when she said she acknowledged
                        it was foolish for her to attempt to resist Mr. S—, as he was so much
                        stronger than herself, but all she regretted was that she was not able to
                        take him over her knee and give him a good whipping, as he deserved.</p>
                     <p>Whatever faults were attributable to Ruth Rover, and she undoubtedly had
                        faults, we believe she had not that of deceit. She abhorred it in others,
                        and endeavored to avoid its practice by herself. The same unshrinking
                        fortitude which led her to attempt to perform whatever she supposed to be
                        her duty, however great the barriers, also led her to face error fearlessly
                        and endeavor to have it removed. She could see no need of its existence. Why
                        should not every one do right and then there would be no trouble? she
                        frequently asked—but her knowledge and experience were limited. Different
                        circumstances and appearances produce different impressions of what is right
                        or wrong, hence in the midst of such an immense variety of character,
                        tastes, habits, circumstances, influences and aspirations, none can be too
                        cautious in forming an opinion of the motives and dispositions of
                        others.</p>
                     <p>In the "business world" 'tis said to be good policy to practice deceit, but
                        we do not believe in it. If it is <emph>good policy</emph>, 'tis bad
                        principle—and abominable practice, to use it for purposes of trade, and when
                        once discovered must lead the upright mind to abhor and avoid the deceiver
                        forever after. But when employed to please those whom we think above us in
                        point of wealth or honor—passing over all their errors, even though they are
                        so outrageous that the very dogs bark at them, is a degree of degrading
                        sycophancy that disgraces this lower world, black as it is with crime.</p>
                     <p>Whatever Ruth Rover dared to think that she also dared to say, and this
                        disposition obtained her many enemies when she might, by closing her eyes to
                        error, using flattering speech, telling a few lies occasionally, and
                        suffering evil to exist however hideous in shape, have had more friends—but
                        for this kind of friendship she was not anxious—she preferred a quiet
                        conscience and peace with God, to the false glare of <emph>numbers</emph> of
                        friends, whose integrity of character could not be relied upon.</p>
                     <p>During her residence of nearly two years at the Oregon mission she saw much
                        which was wrong. Supported as that mission was by the church, she believed
                        the missionaries should have acted in compliance with the wishes of that
                        church; property which had been given for the benefit and elevation of
                        Indians should have been appropriated to that purpose; articles which had
                        been given to enable them to carry on their operations successfully should
                        have been preserved and used with as much care as if belonging to the
                        individuals; and the <emph>time</emph> of the missionaries, for which they
                        were receiving salaries, should have been appropriated, at least in the
                        main, to the benefit of the mission.</p>
                     <p>With these impressions, Ruth believed it wrong for the goods and clothing
                        intended for gratuitous distribution among the tribes of Indians is to be
                           <emph>sold</emph> to them, and at high prices, taking their beaver and
                        deer skins from them at not one twentieth per cent their value, while those
                        who were able to buy were obliged to go without—lying sick and
                        destitute—uncovered and unfed, within view of the mission door, till death
                        closed the scene, and then be tied up in the rags on which death relieved
                        them, and be carried to a hole, swung across the back of a husband or
                        friend.</p>
                     <p>She believed, too, that it was wrong for fanning mills to be left in the
                        open air during all weathers, and till at last burned by accident; and to
                        say nothing of harnesses, farming utensils, &amp;c., &amp;c., that were
                        uncared for till they were destroyed, or stolen, or burned; or of barrels of
                        salt left in the rain till they were liquefied. She believed it was wrong
                        for those who were paid for these very services to waste their time
                        altogether in lounging, reading, riding or visiting, or in any other way
                        than in doing, their duty in these respects.</p>
                     <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC5702-00000041"/>
                     <p>And in relation more particularly to herself, she felt it was wrong to
                        circulate the story that she was a maniac, because she presumed to think she
                        could render a neighbor more comfortable in his table fixings, and because
                        she pinned a hand-kerchief over the back of her bonnet when she was working
                        in the sun, saying one to another, behind her back, <emph>there</emph> is a
                        sign she is a maniac! what is that hand-kerchief pinned on her bonnet for?
                        and for several days observing every movement to obtain a confirmation of
                        these suspicions. And she felt it wrong, when she had fallen from her horse
                        and was ill in consequence, to so far neglect her as to suffer her to live
                        for three weeks on roasted potatoes, brought her mostly by an Indian girl,
                        with only one exception to this kind of food for that length of time—the
                        considerate Mrs. Leland once sent her an apple pie and some preserves. She
                        felt this was wrong and cruel, inasmuch as in the same house Mrs. S— was
                        living on every luxury the mission afforded. And to interrupt her in every
                        plan she undertook to benefit the Indians, because it was doing more than
                        themselves—and to abuse her before strangers because she cut a piece of soap
                        for the girls' washing without asking Mr. Shepherd, and offered a bowl of
                        milk to a visitor, and clean plates to his daughters when at Mrs. Shepherd's
                        table, without "her orders," being told by Mr. Shepherd that his wife was
                        the mistress of the house, and no one would be allowed to sit at her table
                        and take such liberties—and because she took a wash tub from Mrs. Shepherd's
                        servant for the girls' washing, on the day assigned them for this work—and
                        because she used an old tin pan to remove the ashes from the fire place,
                        thereby making it much sweeter, being told by Mr. Shepherd that Mr. Lee had
                        left all those things in his care and he had to see that they were taken
                        care of, notwithstanding. Ruth told him she would not suffer it to be
                        injured for she was aware it should be used very carefully, for her mother
                        had <emph>two</emph> once, and when she was a good girl she used to allow
                        her to sit and hold them! and that she believed she was old enough to have
                        some idea how articles of that and different value should be used—and to
                        hide the molasses cup because Ruth had put some molasses over some
                        blackberries she was eating—and to put some small pumpkins under lock and
                        key for fear Ruth would use them—and to put about half a barrel of rocks on
                        the top of salted meat that she might not use it, being about fifty pounds
                        more than was needed or used generally to press it under pickle—and to
                        refuse for her table, flour, and tea, and coffee, and sugar, and butter,
                        when people from abroad were coming to the mission house to eat, at the time
                        of the protracted meeting, saying there was none to spare when, their own
                        table was loaded with every luxury—and to use altogether themselves,
                        excepting what little the superintendent could obtain by much difficulty and
                        contention, and almost using deceit, all the stores sent by the board, or
                        raised on the farm, or purchased at Vancouver—and to endeavor to annoy her
                        by having the milk set in her closet, when there was one built purposely in
                        their own part of the house, frequently leaving slops of cream and milk upon
                        the floor for her to remove—and by placing every Saturday twenty or
                        twenty-five pumpkin pies, baked for the Indian children, on the library
                        floor, where they had to remain till Sunday evening, (although there was
                        plenty of room elsewhere,) much to the satisfaction of cats and dogs and the
                        discomfort of certain feet clothed in moccasins—and by insisting that the
                        door between her room and the Indian children's should be open at meal
                        times, keeping a watch by its side for the purpose of opening it again when
                        Ruth would shut it—and by insisting that the boys' clothing should be kept
                        in that room, notwithstanding all her desires to have it kept in order, it
                        being the principal room of the mission house, where were held all meetings
                        except on the Sabbath, and was the only place where company could be
                        received—and by insisting that the Indian boys should, at another time, in
                        carrying their pails of milk to the cellar, take it through the front door,
                        when the back door was nearer, by which means they frequently spilled it
                        upon the floor, and seemed to take a pleasure in doing so, and if any word
                        was spoken to induce them to be more careful, they were sure to throw it out
                        of the pails purposely and give some insolent language besides—and by
                        ordering Indians to throw mud out of a tub which Ruth had had mixed for her
                        to mend the mud fire place and chimney in the mission room, before Dr.
                        Binney, just at the time that she was engaged in the work, and which would
                        have prevented her from accomplishing it—and by bringing an old shelf which
                        had been suspended in this same room, and bore upon its delicate shoulders
                        an old broken pitcher of salve, two tubeless lamps, one half of a pair of
                        scissors, an indefinite number of old lamp tubes, rags for scrofula
                        purposes, two old knives for spreading these with salve, torn books, a
                        broken crane hook, half burnt ironing holders, one or two necks of broken
                        bottles with the corks in them. &amp;c., &amp;c., and junks of mud,
                        quantities of cobwebs, dead flies, rat signs and broken nails without
                        measure, so repeatedly to its former place, and burdening it again with most
                        of its usual treasures, that its disposition to return could not be
                        conquered till she had sawed down the pins which supported it, and this at a
                        time when Ruth was lining the room with mats at her own expense and nailing
                        them up herself alone, Mr. Shepherd telling her she had no business to make
                        any changes or improvements in the place.</p>
                     <p>She believed it was wrong, too, when, after she had washed and put in order
                        Mrs. Lee's whole wardrobe, in addition to many other heavy services by which
                        she had injured her health and was obliged to use restoratives, for her to
                        be obliged to sleep in an open log house at Mr. Beer's, thereby taking
                        colds, and teeth-ache, and agues, till she was almost unable to perform any
                        labor, and when told by the superintendent to occupy Mrs. Lee's room till
                        another could be prepared, to find herself twice locked out and her things
                        thrown upon the floor—and when she had slept there the third time and was in
                        the act of making the bed in the morning, to have the bed taken away, Mr.
                        Shepherd saying, "This is sister Lee's bed—you have no business on sister
                        Lee's bed"—the bed quilt, though hers own, torn out of her hand, and herself
                        violently thrust out of the room.</p>
                     <p>And she believed it wrong, too, when any members of the mission wanted any
                        article which was for sale in the mission (and which was originally intended
                        to be <emph>given</emph>, if anything may be understood by the directions on
                        packages, which were generally of this nature: "To the mission sisters." "To
                        the members of the mission family," "For the children of the missionaries of
                        the Oregon Mission," &amp;c.,) for prices to be set upon them far exceeding
                        their first cost in the United States.</p>
                     <p>These are some of the things which Ruth Rover considered wrong about the
                        transactions of that mission, and about which she dared to say so. Reader
                        wasn't she quarrelsome?</p>
                     <p>A few items from the journal will show how, while these things were going on
                           <emph>in</emph> the house, Ruth was endeavoring to be useful
                           <emph>out</emph> of it.</p>
                     <p>"Having had leisure to-day, after service at church, went to the lodges,
                        where were six adults—some sick and lying upon on the ground, others stupid
                        and indolently idling away the Sabbath. One young man repeated with me the
                        Lord's prayer. I asked them if it would please them to have me come among
                        them when I could and teach them, they replied yes, 'twould be very good for
                        me to do so.</p>
                     <p>"Visited the Indians again to day and found eleven adults. Sickness, filth,
                        indolence and extreme stupidity are glaringly prominent to the visitor on
                        entering these lodges. Only one woman would repeat a prayer after me.
                           <emph>Squipick</emph>'s wife will apparently soon be relieved from her
                        miseries; endeavored to converse with her on the subject of death, but she
                        appears entirely senseless. Been for a week or more engaged in the study of
                        the Calapooyah language; find it pleasant and very regular in its
                        syntax.</p>
                     <p>"<emph>Squipick</emph>'s wife this morning left this world, of which she
                        knew so little, and departed to one of which she knew still less. A loud
                        wailing we heard assured<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC5702-00000042"/> us of the
                        fact, and on my going to the lodge I found <emph>Squipick</emph> tying her
                        in a piece of dirty blanket, in the same position in which she died—coiled
                        nearly double, and in dirt and filth. The chief and some others came to
                        assist him in burying the corpse, which he carried away upon his back, the
                        supporting rope resting upon his forehead.</p>
                     <p>"These tribes bury their dead under the ground, with their property, if it
                        be but an old pail, or knife, or blanket, hanging or resting about it, and
                        although they have as great a propensity to steal as to breath, yet no one
                        is ever found to rob the graves of their dead.</p>
                     <p>"Visited the Indians; eleven present. Nearly all responded prayer with me.
                        and three attempted to sing. When going to their lodge felt very sensible of
                        my weaknesses and want of the graces of the spirit, but was interested and
                        blessed while with them, especially when in praying for their conversion,
                        and that I might be enabled to be useful to them.</p>
                     <p>"Nine Indians present, and a greater interest manifested by them than I have
                        before discovered. All responded with me and tried to sing. One woman
                        interrupted me by saying, ''tis very good for you to come every Sabbath and
                        talk with us.' May the Holy Spirit accompany my endeavors and teach them the
                        way of salvation.</p>
                     <p>"Very disconsolate! The great trials to which I have been subjected, during
                        my residence in this far off land, most perpetually prey upon my spirits,
                        and I suffer extremely. Since last Sabbath have been extremely blessed and
                        comforted by my Heavenly Father, and last evening enjoyed a most refreshing
                        season in praying for my dear christian friends in the United States.</p>
                     <p>"This afternoon visited three Indian lodges, about one mile and a half from
                        here. Witnessed sickness, misery and pollution. On going to my people (if
                        such I may call them) only four adults were present, the rest having been
                        called away by Mr. Whitcomb to account for stealing squashes. They said it
                        was good for them to speak with me.</p>
                     <p>"Conversed to-day with a young Indian from Walla Walla, who can speak
                        English tolerably well, having been for some time under the instruction of
                        Dr. Whitman. He has, since his stay among us, manifested a disposition to
                        absent himself from the lodges of his people and spending the time in our
                        houses, seeking instruction in reading, &amp;c. He has been singing me some
                        of the hymns he has learned, and telling me what he knows about the bible.
                        He says that Jesus Christ came here, and wicked men made holes in his hands,
                        and feet, and sides, and he died and was put in the ground—came up again and
                        went to heaven—and that by-and-bye he will come here again, blow a trumpet
                        and all the people will come to him—to the good he will say, 'come,
                        come'—but to the bad he will say, 'go away.' Also, if good people wish to
                        speak to him he will turn his ear and listen, but if bad people speak to him
                        he will stop his ears. Repeating the names of the apostles he said Judas was
                        bad and put something around his neck and he died. He spoke also of the Holy
                        Spirit, and of angels, but I could not comprehend what he wished to convey
                        concerning them.</p>
                     <p>"I was much gratified in witnessing <emph>this</emph> proof of the capacity
                        of these Indians to learn, so dark and degraded do they appear to be in
                        their minds. Some of our mission family have attempted to learn the
                        languages of this people—have written about one hundred words and given up
                        the task as hopeless. Some have tried to instruct them in needlework,
                        housework, mechanism, agriculture, &amp;c., and have each failed of
                        accomplishing the good anticipated.</p>
                     <p>"<emph>I</emph> have made endeavors too, and probably many are saying I
                        shall soon also give up the task, and I do almost every day find my spirits
                        lagging, so great are the numbers of difficulties to be accomplished, and
                        many of them appear so nearly insurmountable—and in what way my anxieties
                        will terminate I am unable to determine. Here are classes numbering perhaps
                        fifty or a hundred Indians, each of which speak a different language, and
                        are continually wandering from one tract of country to
                           another.<emph>They</emph> have no books and we no interpreters; and if by
                        earnest attention we obtain the names of a few nouns, we have no method of
                        obtaining the intervening words to connect them into sentences—and by this
                        time, perhaps, those of this dialect will have gone and another taken their
                        place. So that one obstacle after another rises before us and we decline in
                        our work.</p>
                     <p>"Not like this our presbyterian brethren in the interior, as the case of the
                        young chief will show—and to my regret I will add that I have not, since I
                        have been in Oregon, seen an instance of an adult Indian who has been as
                        much benefitted by the labors of our mission family, as this chief by the
                        labors of our brethren in the interior.</p>
                     <p>"Six adults in my congregation to-day, besides several children.</p>
                     <p>"Ten present to day, besides children. This morning prevailed on six of them
                        to come to church, where they had an opportunity of seeing the members
                        partake of the Lord's supper. In endeavoring to explain to them the reason
                        of our doing so, they gave a general and deep attention to what I said and
                        seemed to understand me.</p>
                     <p>"One of the women, when I went to the lodge, was using her enchantments over
                        a sick man in order to restore him to health. The facility of these
                        prescriptions I do not understand, but suppose they have confidence in them
                        as they are frequently resorted to.</p>
                     <p>"For some months have been suffering from ill health caused in the first
                        place by very hard labor in the mission subsequently to Mrs. Lee's death,
                        and by laboring before recovering my health after the injury received by
                        falling from my horse. For this reason, and the shortness of the days, it is
                        not best, perhaps, to continue my visits to the lodges on the Sabbath.</p>
                     <p>"Our sewing society promises well, but the people are so unstable in all
                        their ways we dare not flatter ourselves with great success.</p>
                     <p>
                        <emph>February,</emph> 1839. "Being somewhat in improved health the
                        superintendent proposes that I receive the boarders again, and that Mr.
                        Whitcomb, the farmer, eat again at my table. Mr. Whitcomb says he will
                        consent to leave Mr. Shepherd's on condition that I promise to pay him the
                        respect which is his due as master of the house, and also promise to obey
                        him. Mr. Whitcomb is a man of very inferior mental capacity, and although I
                        can readily engage to render him all the respect which is his due, yet I
                        cannot bind myself to <emph>obey</emph> him. His disposition is of a very
                        meddlesome and officious character, and he has formerly been the cause of
                        much trouble in the family by going to Mr. and Mrs. Shepherd with every
                        small kind of gossip he could make up; and rather than again be subjected to
                        the same round of troubles, I have begged the superintendent to give me any
                        other situation and employment in the mission rather than this—consequently
                        he has proposed that I live in Mr. Shepherd's part of the house, taking
                        charge of the Indian girls as usual, while Mr. Shepherd lives in the mission
                        proper and boards the laborers," &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>IT cannot be supposed, considering the scarcity of females in Oregon in the
                        days of its early settlement, that Ruth Rover, even with as few fascinations
                        as she possessed, could be long in the country without receiving an offer of
                        marriage—whether it were dictated by love or as a matter of
                        convenience—consequently, she had been but a few days in the Willamette
                        settlement when a very officious gentleman said to her, "Well, sister Ruth,
                        I suppose you will have no objections to marry? it is pretty generally
                        understood that the young ladies come out ostensibly on that errand,
                        although they <emph>profess</emph> to be teachers."</p>
                     <p>Ruth, offended at the start, remarked: "'Tis a great error to suppose that
                        was <emph>my</emph> object in coming. I have no idea of marrying!"</p>
                     <p>"Not of marrying? Why how could you perform your duty to God and to others
                        and not marry? Why 'tis the best thing you can do, to take a husband and
                        raise a family, and show these degraded women and mothers how to keep house
                        and govern their children, &amp;c. Why 'tis the best missionary work you
                        could engage in."</p>
                     <p>Ruth begged he would excuse her from taking part in such conversation, as
                        'twas entirely foreign to her feelings, wish, or calculations.</p>
                     <p>He begged her to explain how she could possess such views, when she must
                        know there were men all around who wanted wives—and <emph>three</emph> in
                        the mission of whom he knew she could have her choice!</p>
                     <p>She told him frankly she was engaged to serve the mission for the space of
                        six years, when she purposed to go home and remain with her aged father
                        during his life; that this was her firm resolution and nothing could cause
                        her to swerve from it.</p>
                     <p>He professed great astonishment that she should have come to Oregon on such
                        a <emph>singular</emph> errand, and told her she would get over it, for one
                        of those <emph>very</emph> pious young men she could have at any
                        moment—though Mr. Wiley was the one <emph>he</emph> should prefer that she
                        would marry, as he was a great friend of his; and if at any moment she felt
                        disposed to signify such a wish, he would be most happy to act as her
                        advocate, and meantime she must believe him her friend, and he hoped before
                        he saw her again she would be deeply in love with Mr. Wiley!</p>
                     <p>At every opportunity this subject was urged, with no better success, till
                        one morning this gentleman requested her to walk with him, and being a short
                        distance from the house, commenced his favorite theme. Ruth told him,
                        plainly, if that was his object in asking her to walk—to urge her to marry
                           <emph>Wiley</emph>—it was useless to go, and she preferred to return to
                        the house; for she had no intention at all to form a matrimonial alliance in
                        Oregon, and if she should ever come to that conclusion, Mr. Wiley would not
                        be her choice at all.</p>
                     <p>The gentleman, greatly offended, told her to bear it in mind that he would
                           <emph>never</emph> name the subject to her again, for he had tried his
                        best to benefit her by offering her a good opportunity to secure a
                        husband—and if she would be guided by him she might be well situated in a
                        home of her own—be her own mistress, instead of being at the beck and
                        command of every one—and be more respectable when a married woman than while
                        a girl—and that, by-the-bye, if she persisted in this plan she would be an
                        old maid, and then <emph>nobody</emph> would have her.</p>
                     <p>Ruth told him that she hoped he would not make himself uneasy for she
                        thought she could take care of herself, and she was pleased to learn that he
                        would not name the subject to her again, for she was tired of hearing
                        it.</p>
                     <p>Under date of September, 1837, we find this item in Ruth's Journal:</p>
                     <p>"Since my arrival at this station Mr. Wiley has made his addresses to me and
                        solicited my hand in marriage. My engagements with the M. Education Society,
                        and desire to labor unshackled and unencumbered in this mission, has induced
                        me to decline bestowing it. This I have done with satisfaction—finding my
                        mind relieved of a burden which before oppressed it. May my Heavenly Father
                        preserve me from imprudent acts while I remain single, and render me
                        abundantly useful in this heathen land."</p>
                     <p>Again under date of March 28th, '38:</p>
                     <p>"Have to-day come to Vancouver for a little relaxation and rest from
                        trouble—and also to be relieved from the importunities of Mr. Wiley. Though
                        I respect him, and believe he would make me a <emph>kind</emph> husband, yet
                        he is not possessed of that strength of intellect and sedateness of mind
                        which I should wish to find in a man with whom I was destined to be engaged
                        in missionary labors. And, besides, the duty I owe to my parents and to the
                        education society would, perhaps, make it necessary for me to decline his
                        offers."</p>
                     <p>Again, June, 1838:</p>
                     <p>"A little more than a week since, in view of my lonely situation, and the
                        little prospect I had of being of any service to the heathen, as I am afraid
                        almost to be seen speaking to an Indian on account of being single, I
                        concluded to accept the hand of Mr. Wiley, which has, until I came to
                        Vancouver, been almost unremittingly proffered to me. I have to-day received
                        a letter from him expressive of great regret for the obligations he was
                        under to a young lady of Boston whom he had concluded to address, supposing
                        that by my continued rejection of his offer I must be disgusted with
                        him."</p>
                     <p>Ruth soon returned to the mission, and in a few days Mrs. Lee's death
                        occurred. The brethren concluded that as Mr. Lee could not have proceeded
                        farther than Walla Walla it was best to send an express to him and acquaint
                        him with his misfortune. This being resolved upon, Mr. Wiley proposed to
                        Ruth that he should send for the letter he had addressed to Miss J—, of
                        Boston, making proposals of marriage to her—it being in the care of Rev.
                        Jason Lee—in order that himself and Ruth might be united, <emph>she</emph>
                        being his preference to any other.</p>
                     <p>She objected to this plan, as she said it might occasion the loss of the
                        letter, and consequently to him the loss of Miss J—, whom he might perhaps
                        obtain if the letter should reach its destination, but for herself she could
                        never marry him unless it were returned.</p>
                     <p>He urged that there was no danger—the company could be overtaken in a month
                        at the farthest, and the note returned within two months—and if she would
                        obligate herself to wait till September, he would run the risk and recall
                        it.</p>
                     <p>She again replied that he was making a venture which might result to his
                        disadvantage, but if he were resolved upon it, and was willing to make that
                        sacrifice for her, she certainly would bind herself to him for the period he
                        named.</p>
                     <p>The express was forwarded, and September came, and all the months till
                        January, 1839, and the letter not returned, Meantime Mr. Wiley and Ruth
                        Rover had been considered as engaged in marriage, and whenever the word
                        should come that the letter addressed to Miss J— had been withheld, they
                        were to be married.</p>
                     <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC5702-00000044"/>
                     <p>His attentions to her had been unremitting—in sickness and in health he was
                        her constant associate—and in all her troubles with other members of the
                        mission family he was apparently her only friend. She reposed confidence in
                        him as in a brother—told him all her troubles—and on every occasion sought
                        his advice.</p>
                     <p>An item from the journal may not be uninteresting here:</p>
                     <p>"This winter we have boarded together alone. The persecutions I have met in
                        the mission family have made me oftentimes very much depressed in spirit,
                        and I have sought the sympathy of friends wherever I could find it—excepting
                        that I have not, perhaps, looked to God for support as much as I had ought.
                        Of a warm confiding temperament, I am apt when I find a friend, to repose my
                        whole trust in him or her, and it may be to this disposition, which perhaps
                        is erroneous, that I am indebted for the severe disappointments I have three
                        times sustained, in which it has seemed the very fountains of life have been
                        scathed and withered by sorrow. No one, I'm sure, could more sensibly
                        realize the need of a <emph>friend</emph> than myself in this heathen
                        land—so far from those who care for me, and where it is almost impossible
                        for a female to return to her home, if she should desire it, and with nearly
                        every one of the mission family censuring and condemning me.</p>
                     <p>"These things I name as one, and a great cause, of my putting so much
                        confidence in Mr. Wiley, which has proved the greatest curse (and yet a
                        blessing) which ever attended me in the course of my life."</p>
                     <p>Mr. Wiley ever expressed great regret for the uncertainty of the prospect
                        before them, and declaring it his settled belief that Mr. Lee had received
                        his note requesting him to withhold his letter from the young lady
                        addressed, endeavored to persuade Ruth to marry him at any rate. He urged in
                        fact that they were as man and wife to each other, having been engaged for
                        some months, and it was only misfortune which kept them separate, and if
                        Miss J— should happen to come out to him and he were married to another,
                        'twould be overlooked under such circumstances—especially he urged, <emph>if
                           certain circumstances could be admitted as an excuse.</emph>
                     </p>
                     <p>From this moment Ruth Rover was in the highest degree censurable for
                        spending any more time in his company. She knew his purpose, but trusting in
                        her own strength to avoid danger, did not at once summon resolution to break
                        from the snares which bound her. At length, finding resolution necessary,
                        she obtained supernatural strength and told him resolutely she would
                           <emph>never become his wife under any circumstances!</emph>
                     </p>
                     <p>She says in her diary:</p>
                     <p>"In conclusion about Mr. Wiley. I have reposed all the confidence in him
                        which I could have done had I been married to him. Boarding with him for
                        several months has given me an opportunity to become thoroughly acquainted
                        with him, and many circumstances combined have given me an extreme dislike
                        of him and led me to tell him plainly that I had no intention whatever of
                        ever marrying him.</p>
                     <p>"He became violently angry, and declared that I was 'engaged to him till Mr.
                        Lee's return—that we had confided in each other for a length of time, and
                        'twas not right that either one should marry any other—and that if I refused
                        him and received the addresses of any other man he would expose to every one
                        every particular I had ever confided to him, and would <emph>give me a cup
                           of sorrow I would have to drink to the dregs!'"</emph>
                     </p>
                     <p>He went out in anger and haste, and finding Mr. Beers told him, crying, that
                        he was in a most unfortunate situation in regard to Miss J— of Boston, for
                        he had requested her to come out to Oregon to marry him, and then had sent
                        an express to have the letter withheld, being encouraged to expect to marry
                        Miss Rover, and he did not know whether the letter had been received—she
                        might come, and he was in great pain to confess that his intimacy with Miss
                        Rover had been such that it was proper that he should marry her instead of
                        Miss J—, and he wanted the church to befriend him in so doing—that Miss
                        Rover was opposed, but he was sure with their influence she would yield.</p>
                     <p>This was immediately communicated to Rev. Mr. Leland, pastor of the church,
                        who called on Miss Rover, in company with Mr. Wiley, and said he had come on
                        an unpleasant errand, but if she would take the proper steps it might be
                        soon passed over, and then asked her, as he said, "'in the authority of her
                        pastor, if she had committed the crime of adultery or fornication with Mr.
                        Wiley?"</p>
                     <p>She, astonished, replied quickly, "No!"</p>
                     <p>He then asked Mr. Wiley if he had "been guilty of committing that crime with
                        Miss Rover?"</p>
                     <p>He attempted to answer, but his deeply wrought feelings choked his
                        utterance, and he only articulated, "O! dear!—I—I—am in the hands of my
                        brethren—they—they—may do as they ple—ple—ase with me!"</p>
                     <p>Mr. Leland then told Ruth that "her best course would be to
                           <emph>confess</emph> her fault, and 'twould be all over—'twould not hurt
                        her at all—the brethren would forgive her—he knew of two methodist ministers
                        who were guilty of that error—before marriage, but they confessed it and it
                        was all passed over. But he would have her remember that if she refused to
                        confess, it was in his power to suspend her labors in that mission."</p>
                     <p>Ruth replied that she was not at all disinclined to make confession of any
                        wrong act of which she was guilty—that she fully and freely confessed she
                        had done wrong in keeping company with Mr. Wiley after he had proposed
                        improper intercourse with her, but the <emph>crime of which he spoke she
                           never had committed with him nor with any other.</emph>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. Leland added: "'Twill not do—you must acknowledge it, for the brethren
                        will be satisfied with nothing else!" and having told her he should call
                        again, he went away.</p>
                     <p>In a few hours he came again with a paper on which was written:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="i"/>"To the M. E. Church in Oregon:</p>
                     <p>"DEAR BRETHREN—With deep regret I have to acknowledge to you that I have
                        been guilty of the crime of fornication.—hoping God to forgive me,"
                        &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>He asked Ruth to sign it. She read it and gave it to him again, saying she
                        was <emph>not guilty.</emph>
                     </p>
                     <p>He endeavored to induce her to sign it, by entreaties, assuring her it would
                        "do her no harm at all—'twould never go out of the mission—and 'twould be
                        forgotten;" and by threats that she "certainly would be allowed to labor no
                        more there if she refused, and her situation in that case would not be
                        enviable, to have it go abroad that she had been expelled for such a crime
                        as that, when it was so easy to have it all passed over—and it very
                        frequently happened that persons in high standing in the church had to make
                        such confessions." But still she refused, and he went away again.</p>
                     <p>In the evening he called at her room after she had retired, and told her
                        "the brethren were below and awaiting her <choice>
                           <sic>acknowledgement</sic>
                           <corr>acknowledgment</corr>
                        </choice> of the error in question," using the same sophistry as before, and
                        that he should not ask her again if she refused <emph>then, and she knew
                           what the consequences would be.</emph>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ruth Rover, in despair—helpless—friendless—and <emph>reckless</emph>—seeing
                        ruin before her on either hand, concluded to take that which would be
                        longest time in coming—put her signature to the fatal paper!</p>
                     <p>Mr. Leland at the church meeting informed the members, still holding the
                        paper in his hands, that "Ruth Rover had <emph>confessed</emph> the crime of
                        which she had been accused," without naming any of the facts in relation to
                        her denying the crime, and the flatteries and threats he had used to induce
                        her to confess it. What would he more?—she had <emph>confessed</emph>
                        herself guilty, and that was all he wished.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Wiley embraced the brethren, put his arms around their necks, and wept,
                        or tried to weep.</p>
                     <p>The meeting being closed, Mr. Leland called at Ruth's door late in the
                        evening and told her he was happy to inform her<pb n="88-89"
                           xml:id="VAC5702-00000045"/> it was "<emph>all ended—the papers were
                           burned—the brethren forgave her, and all was peace again!</emph>"</p>
                     <p>We offer no remarks. The future part of Ruth Rover's history will be the
                        best commentary on this subject.</p>
                     <p>By reference to Ruth's journal we find in connection with the former
                        quotation:</p>
                     <p>"Our situation becoming unpleasant, as we were boarding together, I begged
                        of the superintendent that some means might be devised whereby we might not
                        be subjected thus to meet—and he was requested to remove to Mr. B—'s family.
                        * * * * * *</p>
                     <p>"I am thus far separated from a man who has nearly proved my ruin, and who
                        has only repaid my trust with abuse the most flagrant.</p>
                     <p>"A person acquainted with human nature can form some idea of the state of
                        suffering to which I have been subjected since this last severe trial of my
                        life. How desirable has appeared the rest of the grave. In the language of
                        sister Summers, I have 'asked this boon alone—'tis all I crave—to sleep,
                        forgetting every anxious fear, and every wrong which hath this bosom
                        torn—and every secret sorrow I have known—O! then I'm happy, then I'm blest
                        indeed!'"</p>
                     <p>Poor Ruth! don't give up yet—this is but the <emph>beginning</emph> of
                        sorrows!</p>
                     <p>This very unpleasant affair occurred just at the time of the revival of
                        religion at the mission, in which several of the settlers and Indian
                        children were hopefully converted. We say <emph>hopefully</emph>, and we
                        mean so. The work was undoubtedly that of the Spirit of God; and it was
                        excited and kept up for a few days with the ardor which ever characterizes
                        similar excitements when the <emph>Spirit</emph> and <emph>men</emph> are
                           <emph>ready</emph>. The blaze went out as suddenly as it ran through the
                        stubble of sin; and what is more lamentable, no living embers remain to show
                        that it ever had been.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Wiley went from the place of accusation—confession and
                           <emph>crime</emph>, (according to his own report)—and revenge, into the
                        praying circle, and prayed, and groaned, and exhorted, and wept, and
                        shouted, till Mr. Leland said "the reformation is more indebted to brother
                        Wiley for its life than to any other one here!" O! yes, indeed, for putting
                        it out—for how could it burn with <emph>such</emph> oil poured upon it? Ruth
                        Rover having received an offer of marriage <emph>out</emph> of the mission,
                        resolved to accept it. And this suspicion having got abroad, and Mr. Wiley
                        finding he had not been urged to marry Ruth, nor she him, tried another way
                        to secure her and persuaded some of the brethren and Mr. Leland that it was
                        wrong to suffer a member of the church to marry another under such
                        circumstances—that Dr. Binney ought to be informed of what had occurred—and
                        that if he were, he would undoubtedly refuse to marry Miss Rover.</p>
                     <p>Accordingly, Mr. Leland, Mr. Wiley, and one other waited on Ruth. Mr. Leland
                        informed her that he should never consent for her nor any other member of
                        that mission to marry any person under such circumstances as were connected
                        with herself, without their being first made acquainted with those
                        circumstances—that he understood she was expecting to marry Dr. Binney, and
                        he should not give his consent for her to marry any other than Mr.
                        Wiley.</p>
                     <p>Ruth replied that she could "never marry a man for whom she entertained not
                        sufficient respect to induce her to render him the service which would be
                        required of her, and that it was entirely useless for him to urge her union
                        with Mr. Wiley—she never would marry him—and if he refused to marry her to
                        Dr. Binney she should decline his offer, for there was no other priest in
                        that part of the country who could perform the ceremony."</p>
                     <p>He at last said he would not oppose the match if she would consent to have
                        Dr. Binney made acquainted with the late occurrences in relation to herself
                        and Mr. Wiley.</p>
                     <p>She replied she had no objections whatever, and preferred he should be made
                        acquainted with those occurrences.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Wiley, thus again defeated, in a few days came into her room without
                        permission, when Ruth, with as <emph>much</emph> good breeding, requested
                        him to leave it—and thus ended, for the time, this interesting affair.</p>

                     <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
                     <p>IT has been very distressing to the compiler to find it necessary to present
                        to the public the matter contained in and the foregoing chapter, but as it
                        is her to bring the <emph>truth</emph> to light, irrespective of whom it may
                        injure, she has felt compelled to submit it.</p>
                     <p>It appears that Ruth Rover did not know till the year 1843 that Mr. Leland
                        did not present this matter at the church meeting as he understood it and
                        had received it from her, viz: That she acknowledged fully that she had done
                        vastly wrong in remaining in Wiley's company after any improper intimacy had
                        been proposed, but that she denied fully and positively the committal of the
                        crime. Had she known <emph>then</emph> as much as she has since learned of
                        the disposition of many persons on this subject of woman's weakness, she
                        would have perished at the feet of her persecutors before she would have
                        suffered them to possess so good a shaft against her. But, beguiled as she
                        was, by the pretended friendship of Mr. Leland, and the assurances that
                        there was nothing required to bury it forever in oblivion but her <choice>
                           <sic>acknowledgement</sic>
                           <corr>acknowledgment</corr>
                        </choice> of the error, and that the brethren understood the case and were
                        ready, when she had acknowledged it, to be on the same terms of friendship
                        with her as before—and, farther, discouraged and reckless as she felt, in
                        view of the protracted troubles she had endured, and without a person in the
                        remote wilds of Oregon to assist her, she suffered the accusation to stand
                        as they desired it—and for the consequences of which a whole life cannot
                        atone.</p>
                     <p>This was the whole object of Mr. Leland. She was <emph>disgraced now,</emph>
                        sufficiently ever do him any more injury, and the satisfaction he felt was
                        expressed in a note to her the next morning, when he congratulated her on
                        "the happy termination of a disagreeable affair," and added, "as long as you
                        manifest so submissive and becoming a spirit, I shall be most happy to be
                        your best friend."</p>
                     <p>
                        <emph>Long years</emph> often afford convictions and evidences which cannot
                        be gained in a brief period.</p>
                     <p>
                        <emph>Fourteen</emph> years have elapsed since the occurrences we have
                        named. Mr. Wiley has been urged and encouraged by Rev. Mr. Leland to the
                        occupancy of the pulpit and offices in the church, as well as to public
                        offices, for which, however, he was totally inadequate, on every possible
                        occasion, and he may be seen on every Sabbath day, in the methodist church
                        in Salem, sitting in the altar, leaning his head upon the pulpit, with as
                        much complacency as the loved disciple leaned his head on the bosom of his
                        Lord—or hurrying officiously through the aisles of the church into the
                        pulpit or gallery, with all the apparent consciousness of superior piety and
                        influence.</p>
                     <p>While on the other hand, Ruth Rover, although her life since that period, as
                        well as before, has been unimpeachable; lately passed <emph>six months in
                           that town, and in their very midst, and not one individual of that
                           mission family spoke to her during the time.</emph> Once Ruth extended
                        her hand, gratuitously, to Mr. Leland, feeling grateful that he had not
                        attempted to injure her cause in court—although, perhaps, had he been
                        interrogated he would have been glad to have done it. Aside from this, the
                        prisoner "<emph>Sellers</emph>" was not treated with more contempt than
                        herself.</p>
                     <p>But we have much more to say by-and-bye, on this subject, and we will recur
                        again to Ruth. She had relied on Rev. Mr. Leland, in leaving home and
                        sacrificing her father and inheritance, as on a "father." She was an orphan
                        in a strange land. Her suspicions against his character ter for veracity
                        were well supported in the mission, as well as elsewhere<ref rend="super"
                           target="#note_002" xml:id="return_002">*</ref>
                        —and if Mr. Leland was not guilty in this not <emph>Heaven</emph>,
                        who befriends the up right, have protected and befriended this man?</p>
                     <note place="foot" xml:id="note_002">
                        <p><ref target="#return_002">*</ref>In the year 1843, Ruth remarked to a gentleman with whom she was
                           sailing: "My troubles in the mission were probably all occasioned by
                           my suspecting Mr. Leland guilty of falsehoods." When he added, "and
                           we—I know he <emph>will lie</emph>—for I have had dealings enough with
                           him to know."</p>
                     </note>
                     <p>It is written: "It were better for a man that a mill-stone were hung about
                        the his neck and he were drowned in the depths of the sea, than that he
                        should offend of these little ones which <emph>believe in me.</emph>" If
                        Ruth Rover could not claim to be one of the "little ones" who served her God
                        in strict purity of life, she could claim to be one who did
                           "<emph>believe</emph>" in Him, and his belief was ever the guiding star
                        of her life. But for this belief—this super-human existence—no <emph>mortal
                           could</emph> have endured the intense burdens which me, nor been her lot
                        to bear for a term of sixteen years.</p>
                     <p>But what have been the indications of providence towards Mr. Leland? While
                        we feel disposed to "lay our finger upon our lips and distrust our own
                        judgment," we will say, in our humble opinion, they have been that of
                        disapprobation. When we consider the <emph>burning</emph> of his
                           <emph>house</emph> and <emph>property</emph>—the <emph>loss</emph> of his
                           <emph>wife</emph>—<emph>three</emph> children carried over into the chasm
                        of the falls—another <emph>daughter dying</emph> at Oahu—his <emph>barn
                           burnt</emph>—<emph>another child buried</emph>—and <emph>sickness</emph>
                        and <emph>infirmity</emph> on every hand, we cannot, even while we feel
                        disposed to extend sympathy and <choice>
                           <sic>commisseration</sic>
                           <corr>commiseration</corr>
                        </choice> for his afflictions, we <emph>cannot</emph> help coming to
                        conclusion.</p>
                     <p>A few items more from Ruth's journal will include her labors at the mission
                        Under date of March 2d, 1839, she says:</p>
                     <p>"A few days since one of Mr. Shepherd's servants, wishing to go to the
                        chamber above my room, came to the door and finding it fastened, for I was
                        just then dressing, attempted to ascend the stairs on the outside, when Mr.
                        Shepherd told her to go through my room or he would <emph>push</emph> her
                        through, and added, in presence of the mission Indian boys and Mr. Whitcomb,
                        that ''tis abominable for her to act so like the d—l as she does.' Not
                        knowing what he could have against me, I asked Mr. L— to enquire, and he has
                        been here this evening to tell me the result. He says Mr. Shepherd informs
                        him that he knows nothing against me, nor any reason why I should not enjoy
                        all the privileges of the church which others enjoy—that he spoke
                        improperly, and he regretted that he so indulged his passion. Another
                        unpleasant occurrence thus far settled. From the fact that Mr. Leland and
                        myself have been unhappy together since we came here, and were so when we
                        arrived, the other members seem to have taken strength to oppose me
                        supposing, and naturally enough, that <emph>I</emph>, and not the older and
                        more influential members of the family, were to blame.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="i"/>March 3d. "Had the happiness of at the Lord's table, Dr. W. J.

                     <p>"BRO. BROWN: You requested me, through the Herald, to send you a copy of the
                        letter which I received from Oregon. It was from brother Shepherd, and of an
                        earlier date than some which you had previously received. It does not
                        contain much that will be interesting to any but intimate friends, and that
                        relation brother Shepherd and myself hold to each other. With the exception
                        of a few lines, I will submit it to you for perusal, and you are at liberty
                        to make what use of it you please. I will just say that Mrs. Cummings'
                        sister, who died in the summer of 1836, near the close of her life requested
                        that all her school books, of which she had many, should be sent to Oregon
                        after her decease, and that a native child might be called by her name,
                        Sally Soule. She felt a particular interest in this mission from its first
                        establishment.</p>

                     <p>"DEAR BROTHER &amp; SISTER CUMMINGS: I received your letter and note, and
                        agreeably to request have named a little girl after your deceased sister,
                        Sally Soule. She is almost ten years of age, has a flat head, short neck,
                        and thick set body, which is the general shape of the native females. She is
                        rather shrewd, and quite an adept in mischievous pranks. Sometimes, when the
                        Indians come about, she has come and asked me to let her have some wheat to
                        give to her people. I always ask her how many people she has, and the answer
                        invariably is one. She is an orphan, and it appears knows but one relative,
                        an old woman. When we took her in, which was in the summer of 1837, her only
                        articles of clothing consisted of a wild-cat's skin thrown over her
                        shoulders, and a fringe of dressed deer-skin around her waist. These were
                        her clothing by day, and bedding by night.</p>

                  <div type="letter">
                     <p>DEAR MARY ANN: I believe in my last letter to you I told you I would comply
                        with your request, and write you some account of the Indian children here,
                        to be published in the Sabbath School Messenger. I then intended to do so,
                        but have since that time considered myself very inadequate to appear as a
                        public writer and therefore have concluded to give the same account to you
                        in a private letter, with however, the permission to publish it if you shall
                        think it possesses sufficient merit.</p>
                     <p>One thing it is very necessary you should consider when reading memoirs of
                        heathen children, viz: The disadvantages of their early lives. Should I tell
                           you<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC5702-00000048"/> that a little girl in Boston
                        or Malden was very neat, and attended well to her studies; and was
                        industrious and pious, you would at once, I presume, think it not strange
                        she should be thus interesting, because you would suppose that she had been
                        favored with the examples and instructions of older persons who had tested
                        the advantages of exercising such agreeable qualifications. But should I
                        give you the same relation of an Indian child who had till recently been
                        taught nothing better than to roll in the ashes, or to spend the sunny day
                        in hunting wasps' nests that she might devour the young—and had never been
                        told who made that "big fire without smoke," daily rises in the east to give
                        us light and heat—or seen a book—you should, I think, conclude that to the
                        instructions of the better learned had been added the grace of God, which
                        had so sanctified them to her good that they seemed to be inherent to her
                        nature, and enabled her to appear in all respects but that of a red skin—to
                        be an educated child from christendom.</p>
                     <p>So appeared Sally Soule, the loved Indian girl of ten years, who had resided
                        in the mission family I think but three years previous to her death, which
                        happened when the girls were under my care in the month of February, 1839.
                        She was, if I mistake not, of the Yamhill tribe, from the Yamhill country, a
                        few miles from the methodist mission, on the opposite side of the river. I
                        can relate none of the particulars of her introduction into the mission
                        family, for I was not then in the country, but I soon discovered, on my
                        arrival, that in the circle of girls being educated by the missionaries was
                        one who was occasionally styled the "old maid." I of course felt a little
                        curiosity to learn the cause of this epithet being applied to her who was
                        the youngest of the group, and regarded her for some time with some degree
                        of suspicion.</p>
                     <p>I soon, however, discovered that if there was among the girls' tasks an
                        article of sewing which required especial care, it was given to Sally
                        Soule—that when the others, in their moments of recreation, were running
                        about for berries, or gathering gum to masticate, she, the "old maid," was
                        in the house observing the ladies work, or herself engaged with her
                        patch-work, of which she was very fond. I also perceived that when the <choice>
                           <sic>others</sic>
                           <corr>other</corr>
                        </choice> girls had soiled <unclear>or</unclear> torn their clothes, or were
                        carelessly dressed, she was neatly dressed; and when the children around her
                        were loudly talking and laughing, this little pattern of excellence would be
                        nearly silent, or simply smiling, which showed she was not heedless of their
                        enjoyment.</p>
                     <p>Yet she was not a <emph>stupid</emph> child—she loved to play, but her
                        sports were less noisy and more useful than were those of her mates. Her rag
                        babies displayed her taste for neatness, and the propriety with which every
                        article of dress would be arranged was one cause of her receiving the
                        epithet of "old maid."</p>
                     <p>I cannot say she had been much instructed in this kind of amusement, for, as
                        regards myself, I seldom had occasion to assist her otherwise than to
                        indulge her very modest requests for pieces and thread, for which one of her
                        sweet smiles amply repaid me.</p>
                     <p>As this little girl was thus lovely in her plays you will, I suppose, almost
                        without any intimation from me, conclude she made a proper use of her books.
                        She certainly did—she studied and <emph>learned</emph> her lessons and when
                        the children in the school had carelessly destroyed their books, Mr.
                        Shepherd would often hold up before them Sally Soule's book which was
                        scarcely injured, and exclaim: "See, here is Sally Soule's book which she
                        has had so much longer than you, and it appears almost new!"</p>
                     <p>Being a great favorite with the girls it was amusing, when they had
                        permission to play outside the house, to witness the anxiety of every one to
                        obtain her for a mate. No sooner would the word "Yes" be pronounced than we
                        would hear all their voices at once exclaiming, "and I am going to have
                        Sally Soule!"—"No you won't, for it is now my turn to have her!" "'No—she
                        went with you the last time, and now she must go with me," &amp;c.,</p>

                  <p>ALL the reasons which have induced the compiler to publish this work, at the
                     present time, cannot now be given. The reader will perceive many as he
                     advances, and they will be better understood at its close.</p>
                  <p>The undertaking is considered by her to be bold and hazardous—in consideration
                     of her inexperience as a writer.</p>
                  <p>Unwilling to place any one in an unhappy attitude with others, she has not
                     consented to submit the work to a revisor, whose better judgment would prevent
                     many inaccuracies and oversights in the style, and nature of the subjects
                     introduced, from becoming so apparent as they inevitably will, in consequence
                     of relying altogether upon her own knowledge and understanding.</p>
                  <p>The RELIGIOUS parts of journals and letters, have been much abridged, because
                     not interesting to the general reader, and only so much retained as is thought
                     sufficient to present the story in its true light.</p>
                  <p>Scenes, and language of a revolting character, must sometimes be presented; and
                     the indulgence of the public is most earnestly entreated, while the compiler
                     shall endeavor to do this with as little shock as possible to the finer
                     sensibilities of the heart.</p>
                  <p>For the most part, the manuscripts are presented in their original form; the
                     compiler considering that the involuntary expressions of the mind will better
                     denote its nature, than those highly cultivated passages, which <choice>

                        <corr>lose</corr>
                     </choice> all their native beauty by the labor with which they are brought
                     forth—and herself being solely responsible for what may here appear, she allows
                     this the more readily. "Silver and gold I have none; but such as I have I give
                     unto thee."</p>

                  <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
                  <p>IN the compilation of the second number of the "Grains," the reader is
                     requested to bear in mind that the compiler contends not with individuals—but
                     with <emph>Evil,</emph> that error which more frequently affects the
                        <emph>head</emph> than the <emph>heart,</emph> and which has led many a
                     person in the downward path to ruin, who might as well have occupied a high
                     place in the estimation of the good;—and eternal happiness eventually.</p>
                  <p>On the subject of this publication, Miss Rover, in a note to a friend, dated
                     June 13th, 1854, after referring to some insults and opposition to which she
                     had lately been subjected, and had given the names of the authors, &amp;c.,
                     &amp;c., all of which will be considered in their proper place, says:</p>
                  <p>"It appears very evident that the work of which I once spoke to you, should be
                     published in Oregon. * * * My conscience asserts most positively and
                     approvingly, that, in all my dreadful trials, I have endeavored to perform my
                     duty, faithfully and perseveringly, to my God, my husband, my neighbor, and
                     myself—burying within my own bosom the injustice and injuries which have been
                     done me; and there the remembrance of them would have remained had my enemies
                     been content to have suffered me to pursue my course in peace. But 'tis in vain
                     that I attempt any innocent employment, whether it be intended for recreation
                     or to obtain a livelihood. The young of my classes are withdrawn, when a
                     slander reaches them, for fear of contamination; I am avoided, and shunned, and
                     slighted, and regarded with suspicions in every place, till my life is more
                     burdensome than death would be. I have, therefore, in this conclusion, been
                     impelled by a sense of justice due to myself and a wish that my future life
                     should not be overshadowed by the gloom of the present."</p>

                     <p>THE mission of the Methodist Episcopal church in Oregon, or the "Oregon
                        Mission" as it has been called, may in all propriety be termed a failure.
                        Its wrong locality, and the erroneous pursuits of the missionaries, both
                        operated to make it such.</p>
                     <p>The objects of the Oregon Provisional Emigration Society, and its defeat,
                        were so similar that we presume to make a few selections on the subjects,
                        and also express out own ideas of the mistaken calculations therein treated
                        of.</p>
                     <p>"This Society, formed in August, 1838, has for its object the planting of
                        Christian American settlements in Oregon.</p>
                     <p>"Our purpose in making these settlements will be, first, to spread
                        civilization and christianity among the Indians of that country; and,
                        secondly, to <emph>avail ourselves of the advantages the territory offers<pb
                              n="104-105" xml:id="VAC5702-00000053"/> fers for agriculture,
                           manufactures and commerce."</emph>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here is one error made apparent at the commencement, viz:
                           <emph>avarice.</emph>
                     </p>
                     <p>"For the benefit of the Indians, we propose to establish schools, in which
                        instruction in elementary science will be connected with labor; the males
                        being made acquainted with farming or some useful mechanic art, and the
                        females with household duties and economy.</p>
                     <p>"The age at which we shall admit the pupils, and the length of time for
                        which they will be retained, will enable us to break up their Indian
                        habits."</p>
                     <p>Never! You may rear them from infancy, and they are Indians still.</p>
                     <p>"And to persuade them to turn their attention to the cultivation of the
                        soil, and to the erection of permanent dwellings."</p>
                     <p>We have seen this attempted. They might be induced to cultivate the soil,
                        but for the houses they care nothing. We have known them to refuse to live
                        in log houses built for their residence—liking those better which are easily
                        transported to a different place.</p>
                     <p>"Having reached the Territory, we shall seek such points of settlement as
                        will afford the greatest facilities for intercourse with the tribes; for
                           <emph>agriculture</emph>, <emph>manufactures</emph> and
                           <emph>commerce</emph>; and also for defence, in case of hostilities from
                        any quarter.</p>
                     <p>"Our design to elevate the Indians will make it necessary to be somewhat
                        cautious in the selection of our men, and we shall encourage the migration
                        of none whose character for industry and virtue is not well established.</p>
                     <p>"Let there, then, be planted in Oregon, at several eligible points,
                        settlements, from which missionaries and teachers shall go out in every
                        direction among the <choice>
                           <sic>aboriginees</sic>
                           <corr>aborigines</corr>
                        </choice>, and to which they may look for any assistance they need in the
                        prosecution of their labors. Let these settlements be the centres around
                        which shall be gathered, in new organization, the converted and civilized
                        red men, and where, free from oppression and scorn, they shall, for the
                        first time, find themselves on a <emph>level with white men,</emph> and it
                           <emph>will not be long before such privileges</emph> will <emph>win the
                           entire multitude to embrace a new mode of life</emph>, and above all the
                        gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
                     <p>"We go to Oregon not as the enemies of its aboriginal inhabitants. We go not
                        to scatter fire and death among them, but to carry the branch of peace and
                        the blessings of religion and civilization to those degraded men. We go as
                        their friends, and shall entwine ourselves in all the generous and noble
                        sentiments of the children of the wilderness, and we shall be safe.</p>
                     <p>"As a race, they cannot be saved until they are treated like men. The
                        patient and enduring African may look around upon the wreck of all he loves,
                        and even respect the man who plunders him; but from such subserviency the
                        lofty and chivalrous spirit of the Indian recoils, and he could with greater
                        pleasure die amid tortures than receive benefits from one who would degrade
                        him.</p>
                     <p>"They esteem the whites as a race superior to themselves, and copy them in
                        all things, as far as possible with their limited knowledge and means; nor
                        is there room for a doubt that the arms of civilization and christianity
                        might embrace the entire people in a few years, at most, from the hour when
                        the first <emph>general</emph> effort for their salvation should be made.
                        They are men—men of a high order—they should be treated as such, and they
                        who would save them must not subject them to scorn and disabilities, because
                        they are not white, nor withhold from them those social and civil privileges
                        which they would give to white men of equal intelligence and virtue.</p>
                     <p>"They who would save them must go among them, and while they do not
                        countenance or encourage the savage and wicked practices they may witness,
                        they must, in a certain sense, put themselves on a level with the Indian
                        himself. Civil society, instituted in their midst for the purpose and having
                        provision made for receiving the red man into the enjoyment of all the
                        rights, social and civil, which the whites enjoy, so soon as he should
                        become prepared for it, by renouncing his savage habits and obtaining the
                        qualifications required of a white man, would be a more powerful motive than
                        any which has ever been brought to bear upon the Indian's heart, and would
                        doubtless prove the salvation of the race."</p>
                     <p>All this looks very well in print—but how chimerical! Where was ever a body
                        of men who, though professedly pious, would long remain
                           <emph>entirely</emph> so amidst such inducements to aggrandizement as
                        are, or <emph>were</emph>, presented in Oregon? And where could a community
                        of whites be found who would, for the benefit of Indians, submit to the
                        following "principle" of the above-named society?</p>
                     <p>"That white men, dwelling with them, should have no interests, rights or
                        privileges, personal, social or civil, separate from those of Indians, who
                        possess the same moral and intellectual qualifications as themselves."</p>
                     <p>Nowhere, assuredly, among the fallen sons and daughters of Adam.</p>
                     <p>"That to save and elevate the Indians, the great influences must be those of
                        example and personal instruction, given by residents among them."</p>
                     <p>This is also a "principle" of the same society. We need only refer to Oregon
                        to find illustrations of the working of this plan. There are many
                        professedly <emph>christian</emph> people in every settlement here, and how
                        much have they benefitted the Indians?</p>
                     <p>For instance, where is a settlement more professedly christian, and that
                        retains a greater number of Indians among them than Oregon City? and what is
                        the situation of the latter there? It is but too apparent!</p>
                     <p>But what are the purposes of this society in regard to themselves? Let us
                        read:</p>
                     <p>"It may be inquired, "What is this society? What do you mean to do?"</p>
                     <p>"The territory west of the Rocky Mountains has long been regarded as one of
                        the most interesting portions of our globe, both as it regards the country
                        and its inhabitants. The works of nature are there wrought upon a large
                        scale, and the sublime scenery is more than equalled by the unrivalled
                        productiveness of the soil and the perfect salubrity of the climate. By its
                        situation on the sea coast it has every advantage for trade with California,
                        Mexico, the Western States of South America, Sandwich Islands, Japan, China,
                        Hindoostan, and other parts of the East Indies, Eastern Africa, Java, the
                        Spice Islands, and all the multitude of islands in the Pacific and Indian
                        Oceans; while the Atlantic is quite as accessible from Oregon as is China or
                        Calcutta from the United States or England. The whole inland country is
                        connected with the coast by canals which nature herself has sunk—the mighty
                        rivers of the land; and the products of the soil would find an easy
                        conveyance to points where they might be exchanged for the wares of distant
                        nations.</p>
                     <p>"The fur trade, once the source of many a princely fortune, and even now, in
                        its decline, a very lucrative business; the salmon fishery, for which there
                        are advantages in the rivers of that Territory to be found nowhere else in
                        the world; the cultivation of silk, for which the climate is peculiarly
                        adapted, and which is an article commanding a ready sale the world over; the
                        culture of flax and hemp; the raising of flour, for which a ready market is
                        at hand, together with a thousand other productive employments, would crowd
                        those streams with commerce and the ports with activity and wealth. The oaks
                        and pines of the mighty forests might blend in staunch vessels, which should
                        go forth with the fruits of industry and return with the profits of
                        commerce; and many a trader and many a whaleman would seek the hospitable
                        ports of that country to trade and refit, and thus advance the interests of
                        those who make it their home. Nor is it only for trade the country offers
                           advantages.<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC5702-00000054"/> The farmer and
                        mechanic might there find a home and a competency—the philanthropist a field
                        for the exercise of his charity—and the teacher a school in which he would
                        have opportunity for labor and assurance of success.</p>
                     <p>"We intend to avail ourselves of these advantages, and yet we do not propose
                        to act for mere personal aggrandizement. We have nobler purposes in view.
                        One of the principal objects of the enterprise is the civilization and
                        conversion of the Indians, and the salvation of a remnant of that noble race
                        from utter extinction."</p>
                     <p>Again:</p>
                     <p>"For our own emolument we shall depend principally upon the flour trade; the
                        salmon fishery; the culture of silk, flax, and hemp; the lumber trade; and,
                        perhaps, a local business in furs. We shall establish a regular commercial
                        communication with the United States, drawing supplies of men and goods from
                        thence; and, ultimately, we shall contemplate the opening of a trade with
                        the various ports of the Pacific. A few years only will be required to fill
                        the plains of Oregon with herds as valuable as those of the Spanish
                        savannas; and various sources of profit will reveal themselves, as the
                        increase of the population shall make new resources necessary."</p>
                     <p>But what about this contradiction on the subject of land?</p>
                     <p>"We shall wish that no person in connexion with us may have a claim upon any
                        tract of land, unless he shall actually settle upon and improve that land;
                        believing, as we do, that a <emph>land speculation in that country would be
                           most prejudicial to its best interests, and, above all things, calculated
                           to destroy the last hopes of the Indian race.</emph>
                     </p>
                     <p>"Such are the objects of our society, which we shall doubtless accomplish,
                        if the government of the United States regards us favorably. We shall of
                        course be <emph>very unwilling to settle in a savage wilderness, without
                           having first obtained a sufficient title to the land</emph> we may
                        occupy, and without being assured that political obstacles will not be
                        thrown in the way of our prosperity."</p>
                     <p>Another impracticability is apparent in the following:</p>
                     <p>"Such is the Indian character and mode of life that no general and lasting
                        reform can be effected among them by mere spiritual instruction. In order to
                        do any essential good to this portion of our race, their progress in the
                        arts of life and in civilization must be equal to their advancement in
                        christianity. To save the Indians they must be brought to settle upon and
                        cultivate their lands; to erect permanent habitations; to abandon the chase
                        as a principal means of support, and to engage in the manufacture of
                        whatever may be necessary to the prosecution of their agricultural labors.
                        In a word, they must change entirely their mode of life, and ceasing forever
                        to be wandering hordes of hunters and warriors, they must become a people
                        abiding in their habitations and living upon the produce of the soil.</p>
                     <p>"We are happy to learn that Mr. Lee cordially agrees with us in the primary
                        opinion that in the elevation of the Indian race we must, if we would
                        succeed, teach them the arts of life as fast as we do the truths of the
                        gospel; that civilization and religion, to benefit these savages, must keep
                        pace with each other; and that if one is pressed on before the other, the
                        labor is lost."</p>
                     <p>And yet he says:</p>
                     <p>"Brother Lee, we understand, has come over to consult upon <emph>some new
                           plan</emph> for the elevation of the Indian race."</p>
                     <p>It appears, then, that he is satisfied that the above plan of operation
                        would produce no lasting benefit.</p>
                     <p>"Christianity is perfectly incongruous with the habits of migratory hordes,
                        and can never be sustained among them. If it prevails among them it will
                        induce them to locate and cultivate the soil; if they continue wanderers, it
                        must fail of success."</p>
                     <p>Why so? Can't they carry religion with then?</p>
                     <p>"It has been deemed of primary importance to tell the Indian the story of
                        Jesus and his dying love, in the hope that it would follow him in his savage
                        wanderings and save him. And some, it is true, have been favorably
                        affected."</p>
                     <p>And why is not the prospect as good for many as for a few?</p>
                     <p>But these are all false premises. The same author says:</p>
                     <p>"Experience has taught that what by construction, and what by violation, the
                        Indian has little left to depend upon in the white man's promises. He makes
                        them, he changes them, and he breaks them at will.</p>
                     <p>"We unhesitatingly avow it as our decided opinion that the example and
                        conversation of wicked men is now more than counteracting all the labors of
                        missionaries to the Indians, and this, too, for the simple and natural
                        reason that the number of enlightened christians among the tribes is so
                        small."</p>
                     <p>The same difficulty appears here as before, that of finding any large
                        "number of christians" who will make the elevation of the Indian the
                        business of their lives.</p>
                     <p>This writer's remarks result at last in the following:</p>
                     <p>"In the civilized society of the United States there is no attraction for
                        the red man. If he enters it, he must do so as an Indian; he must enjoy no
                        privileges, because he is an Indian; he must be cheated and ridiculed,
                        because he is an Indian; and he must sacrifice his honor, his interest, and
                        happiness, all because he is an Indian!</p>
                     <p>"Indian society will never be inviolate. The ruthless hand of white cupidity
                        will always be invading its peace and security. It must cease to be
                           <emph>Indian</emph> society. The tribes, <emph>as such</emph> must become
                        extinct and a new organization must take their place, in which there shall
                        be found white men and their rights, to an extent sufficient to secure the
                        respect of civilized nations, and thus the safety of their own
                        community."</p>
                     <p>So, then, to benefit the Indians we must exterminate them. They must no
                        longer <emph>be Indians!</emph> Who would think that because a wild animal
                        is tamed he must take the name of the person who tamed him?</p>
                     <p>But we have other resources for reference besides these. President Van Buren
                        says:</p>
                     <p>"That a mixed occupancy of the same territory by the white and red men is
                        incompatible with the safety or happiness of either.</p>
                     <p>"That the country to which they are removed is one 'much more extensive, and
                        better adapted to their condition than that on which they resided.'</p>
                     <p>"That the United States 'guaranty to them the possession of this country
                        forever,' so that it will be <emph>'exempt from all intrusion of the white
                           men.'</emph>"</p>
                     <p>Our own views of this subject are embraced mostly in the following
                        quotations:</p>
                     <p>"On motion of the Rev. Mr. Remington of Troy, seconded by the Rev. Mr.
                        Stratton of New York:</p>
                     <p>"Resolved, that as all attempts to save the heathen, by teaching them
                        letters and the arts of civilized life <emph>first</emph>, have failed,
                        therefore, in the opinion of this meeting, the only effectual way to bring
                        them to the knowledge of the truth, is, first of all, to carry to them the
                        gospel of Jesus Christ, and that civilization and domestic economy will
                        follow a reformation of heart and life."</p>
                     <p>We have evidence of the feasibility and success of this plan in the instance
                        of the pious Brainerd, who labored among the Indians about the years 1743-7
                        inclusive:</p>
                     <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC5702-00000055"/>
                     <p>"The account which Mr. Brainerd gives in his journal respecting the work of
                        God at those places is replete with interest to the pious heart and argues
                        well for the christian religion. The instances of conversions which he gives
                        are so many—among the very aged, the youth, and those in the meridian of
                        life, among all grades of character, even those addicted to the grossest
                        vices—that we can only glance at them in this article and extract a few
                        paragraphs as specimens of the glorious triumphs of the cross of Christ. In
                        mentioning his first visit at Crossweeksung, he says his hearers increased
                        daily, and the power of God attended his word, and many began to feel a
                        serious concern for their souls and shed many tears. When he left them one
                        of them said, 'she wished God would change her heart;' another said 'she
                        wanted to find Christ;' and an old man, one of their chiefs, wept
                        bitterly.</p>
                     <p>"He says again, respecting the Indians of the same place: 'O! what a
                        difference between these Indians and those on the Susquehanna! To be with
                        those seemed like being banished from God and his people; to be with these
                        like being admitted into his family and the enjoyment of his presence. How
                        great the change lately made upon these Indians, who, not many months ago,
                        were as thoughtless and as averse to christianity as those on the
                        Susquehanna!' Whenever he preached there seemed to be a melting down among
                        the whole assembly, and scarce a dry eye was to be seen among them. After
                        public service the Indians would continue praying among themselves for two
                        hours together.</p>
                     <p>"Again he observes with respect to them in the worship of God: 'These poor
                        Indians, who so lately paid no regard to the glorious truths of the gospel
                        of Jesus Christ, now embrace every opportunity to hear it preached. I have
                        often thought that they would cheerfully attend divine worship twenty-four
                        hours together.'</p>
                     <p>"He commenced his labors April, 1743, among the Indians at Kanuameek, in New
                        York, situated between Stockbridge and Albany. Here was a small tribe which
                        received him very kindly. Mr. Brainerd labored there about one year with all
                        the zeal and diligence his feeble state of health would endure. It was a
                        year of privation and hardship. Yet not a sacrifice too great for such a
                        spirit as that of Brainerd to cheerfully make for Christ and the souls that
                        he had purchased with his own blood.'</p>
                     <p>"In a letter to his brother he mentions his mode of living while with them.
                        'I live,' said he, 'mostly in a melancholy desert, about eighteen miles from
                        Albany, and board with a poor Scotchman. My lodging is a little heap of
                        straw laid upon some boards in a log room without any floor. My diet
                        consists chiefly of hasty pudding, boiled corn, and bread baked in ashes.'
                        After living with this family a few weeks, he removed and lived with the
                        Indians in one of their wigwams, and subsequently he built a small house and
                        lived entirely alone.</p>
                     <p>"The whole time Mr. Brainerd labored among the Indians was less than four
                        years, yet how much was wrought through his instrumentality in that short
                        period, among this much abused portion of our degenerate race! It may be
                        truly said of him, he 'counted not his own life dear unto himself'—he was a
                        willing and whole sacrifice to the cause of degraded humanity. He was
                        unwearied in zeal until entirely prostrated in body, and unable to render
                        any further service to the Indians."</p>
                     <p>Here is an example which it were well for the credit of missionary societies
                        if more would follow.</p>
                     <p>But are there any Indians in Oregon who would thus receive the gospel? Let
                        us turn to Rev. Mr. Parker's Exploring Tour.</p>
                     <p>Of those on the tributaries of the Columbia he says:</p>
                     <p>"The moral disposition of those Indians is very comfortable, certainly as
                        much so as any people that can be named. They are kind to strangers, and
                        remarkably so to one another. While among them I saw no contentions, nor did
                        I hear angry words from one to another other. They manifested an uncommon
                        desire to be instructed, that they might obey and fulfill all moral
                        obligations. "Providentially there came to us this afternoon a good
                        interpreter from Fort Hall, so that to-morrow we can have public
                        worship.</p>
                     <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Sabbath, 6th. Early this morning one of the oldest chiefs
                        went about among the people and with a loud voice explained to them the
                        instructions given them the last evening; told them it was the Sabbath day,
                        and they must prepare for public worship. About eight in the morning some of
                        the chiefs came to me and asked where they should assemble. I asked them if
                        they could not be accommodated in the willows which skirted the stream of
                        water on which they were encamped. They thought not. I then inquired if they
                        could not take the poles of some of their lodges and construct a shade. They
                        thought they could, and without any other directions went and made
                        preparations, and about eleven o'clock came and said they were ready for
                        worship.</p>
                     <p>"I found them all assembled, men, women and children, between four and five
                        hundred, in what I call a sanctuary of God, constructed with their lodges,
                        nearly one hundred feet long and about twenty feet wide; and all were
                        arranged in rows through the length of the building, upon their knees, with
                        a narrow space in the middle, lengthwise, resembling an aisle. The whole
                        area within was carpeted with their dressed skins, and they were all attired
                        in their best. The chiefs were arranged in a semi-circle at the end which I
                        was to occupy.</p>
                     <p>"I could not have believed they had the means or could have known how to
                        construct so convenient and so decent a place for worship, and especially as
                        it was the first time they had had public worship. The whole sight, taken
                        together, sensibly affected me and filled me with astonishment; and I felt
                        as though it was the house of God and the gate of heaven.</p>
                     <p>"They all continued in their kneeling position during singing and prayer,
                        and when I closed prayer with amen, they all said what was equivalent, in
                        their language, to amen. And when I commenced sermon they sunk back on their
                        heels. I stated to them the original condition of man as first created; his
                        fall, and the ruined and sinful condition of all mankind; the law of God,
                        and that all are transgressors of this law, and as such are exposed to the
                        wrath of God, both in this life and the life to come; and then told them of
                        the mercy of God in giving His son to die for us; and of the love of the
                        Saviour; and though He desires our salvation, yet He will not save unless we
                        hate sin and put our trust in Him, and love and obey Him with all our heart.
                        I also endeavored to show them the necessity of renovation of heart by the
                        power and grace of the Holy Spirit; told them they must pray to God for
                        forgiveness of their sins and for salvation.</p>
                     <p>"They gave the utmost attention, and entire stillness prevailed, excepting
                        when some truth arrested their mind forcibly a little humming sound was made
                        through the assembly, occupying two or three seconds. I never spoke to a
                        more interesting assembly, and I would not have exchanged my then audience
                        for any other upon earth; and I felt that it was worth a journey across the
                        Rocky Mountains to enjoy this one opportunity with these heathen, who are so
                        anxious to come to a knowledge of God. I hope that in the last day it will
                        be found that good was done in the name of Jesus.</p>
                     <p>"If christians could have witnessed this day's service they would have felt
                        and they would have been willing to do something adequate to the conversion
                        of those perishing souls."</p>
                     <p>Of the Sioux Mr. Parker says:</p>
                     <p>"On the 30th met in council with the chiefs of this tribe to lay before them
                        the object of our tour, and to know if they would wish to have missionaries
                        sent among them to teach them to read and write, and especially how to
                        worship God. They expressed much satisfaction with the proposal, and said
                        they would do all they could to make their condition comfortable. There can
                        be no doubt that<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC5702-00000056"/> this community
                        of Sioux would be a promising field for laborers. They are inquisitive, and
                        their language is distinct and sonorous.</p>
                     <p>"Who can read these extracts," says Mr. Parker, "without echoing the enquiry
                        of the writer, 'Where are the young men in the christian churches who will
                        go out to these heathen?' Where are they? Let the churches search them out
                        and send them. Let the young men wake up to the call. Let them ask
                        themselves, ought not I to leave all and go seek these lost sheep in the
                        wilderness? What hinders? Are you not qualified to teach these ignorant
                        savages the way of salvation? Can't you beg the means of travelling to their
                        land? Can't you start off, trusting in providence for protection, even if no
                        christian friends, or churches, or mission boards, will grant you aid? See
                        what thousands of young men are wasting their health and energies, in those
                        regions, in the service of the fur companies, moved by a spirit of
                        enterprise and the hope of a paltry recompense of gold and silver. They are
                        hunting for the wild beasts of the prairies and mountains—you may hunt for
                        the recovery of lost immortal souls."</p>
                     <p>In relation to Mr. Parker's account, Hon. Mr. Cushing says:</p>
                     <p>"His manner of relating his discoveries inspires the reader with confidence,
                        and there is no doubt but that his statements may be accredited. They are
                        corroborated by the reports which have come from the missionaries sent out
                        since he was there."</p>
                     <p>We believe, then, most fully, and we consider this belief is supported by
                        the convictions of many persons who have had experience, that to benefit the
                        Indian tribes the work of grace must take <emph>precedence</emph>, and all
                        other efforts for their improvement may then be made with a reasonable
                        expectation of success. Or, in other words, the Indian must first be
                           <emph>caught</emph>, and then he can be instructed. Or, in other words
                        still, <emph>gain his affections</emph>, and you have gained your object.
                        You may tell an Indian that 'tis good for him to raise potatoes, and he will
                        believe you as long as he has them to eat; and you may tell him to love and
                        fear God, and he will try to do so during the danger of a thunder storm,
                        unless his <emph>heart</emph> has been affected with <emph>love to
                           God</emph>, and then he can <emph>trust Him</emph> in its greatest
                        severity.</p>
                     <p>The unsuccessful attempt of the "Oregon Mission" has had the effect greatly
                        to discourage the friends to Indian missions particularly. But this should
                        not be. There are sill opportunities to benefit the Indian tribes, and if
                        properly improved may undoubtedly result in great good.</p>
                     <p>The Presbyterian Mission on the upper Columbia failed, also, from the same
                        errors which operated against the "Oregon Mission," viz: The influence of
                        Romanists and the faults of the missionaries—more particularly that of
                           <emph>avarice</emph>. This latter mission started well and for a time was
                        productive of great good to the natives. They were, to a considerable
                        extent, reformed by the preaching and religious instructions of the
                        missionaries, and they readily gave their attention to agriculture and
                        household economy—as knitting, sewing, weaving, &amp;c.—and learned, to some
                        extent, to read their own language, and were rapidly becoming improved in
                        their habits and way of living but becoming jealous of the designs of—their
                        teachers, by seeing them become possessors of large bands of stock and herds
                        of cattle, and knowing them to receive large supplies of goods from abroad,
                        which, however, they <emph>sold</emph>, and thus obtained and secured their
                        monies, and being excited by white traders who wished to monopolize this
                        trade to themselves; and furthermore being informed by the Roman priests
                        that they were listening to a false religion, it was not very strange that
                        the <emph>savage</emph> nature of this people should have become so far
                        excited as to induce them to the committal of the horrid massacre which
                        stains the history of their nation.</p>
                     <p>Avarice of power and wealth is sure to affect, more or less, the mind of
                        every person who enters a country as rich in resources of competency, and
                        even aggrandizement grandizement, as Oregon; and <emph>firm</emph> must that
                        mind be which can resist all their allurements and pursue a course of
                        self-denial and devotion to the true interests of the cause of Christ.</p>
                     <p>"Ye—can—not—serve—God—and—Mammon!" is a sentence which we wish was
                           <emph>ever</emph> apparent to the vision of the professed followers of
                        the humble Nazarene, and those who cannot endorse its meaning and practice
                        its divine intention are <emph>not fit</emph> to elevate the
                           <emph>cross</emph> of the crucified before <emph>any</emph> people.</p>
                     <p>We <choice>
                           <sic>belive</sic>
                           <corr>believe</corr>
                        </choice> the principal cause of the unprecedented success which has
                        attended the Presbyterian Mission at the Sandwich Islands, has been the
                        restriction placed upon the missionaries by the "Board," viz: that
                           "<emph>they shall not engage in trade of any kind to enrich
                           themselves</emph>." This has restrained the natural inclination for
                        wealth—insured the application of their time to the objects of the
                        enterprise, and been an evidence ever apparent to the eyes of the Hawaiians
                        that they came among them for <emph>their</emph> good and not to benefit
                        themselves. Consequently the blessing of heaven has followed their efforts,
                        and all the combined forces of sin, and the intrigues of the church of Rome,
                        have not been able to overthrow or to interrupt their labors.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, to benefit the Indians, men must not go among them to enrich
                        themselves, but to enlighten them as to a better way of living. They must
                        not draw them into the settlements of the white men, but go into their
                        settlements—and the farther they are removed from white men the better.</p>
                     <p>The writer of the first extracts we made seems to be of this opinion, for,
                        in 1838, he says:</p>
                     <p>"But neither rum nor oppression have yet affected the tribes of Oregon. They
                        have roved, as yet, in their native wilds, undisturbed and uncorrupted by
                        the white man, and there is a chance to save <emph>them</emph>; it is the
                        only chance left upon the continent. If the work of entire civil and
                        religious redemption begins at all, it must begin there."</p>
                     <p>To hope that the races of white and red men will ever blend in one is absurd
                        in the highest degree. A white man will <emph>never</emph> degrade himself
                        to an Indian, in order to benefit the race. He may live among them for this
                        purpose, but they are and must remain as distinct as those of the English
                        and African.</p>
                     <p>There is also an impediment existing in the minds of the Indians themselves,
                        and this same writer admits it:</p>
                     <p>"They will not now, though the opportunity were afforded, coalesce with the
                        whites, even though the safety of their race depended on it."</p>
                     <p>If the truly devoted missionary would enter the forests occupied by none but
                        the red men, and teach them salvation by the way of the cross—trusting for
                        safety on the arm of omnipotence—being willing to live as did Brainerd, if
                        it were necessary—we believe that the songs of the redeemed would be heard
                        there; and if these people preferred to depend on the chase rather than the
                        cultivation of the soil, for support, let them do so. Suffer them to remain
                           <emph>Indians</emph>, as they were born, and, with the blessing of God,
                        they will become <emph>good Indians</emph>, and then they are good
                        enough.</p>

                        </choice>—these were inherent to his nature. His temperament, was
                        sanguineous combined with nervous.</p>
                     <p>When arrived at manhood we find him <emph>dissipated</emph>. But if this
                        were the effects of early improper training, or occasioned by circumstances
                        which surrounded him when away from the restraining influences of watchful
                        parents, we are unable to say. Probably both had an effect.</p>
                     <p>In addition to this, we find him, in maturer<pb n="112-113"
                           xml:id="VAC5702-00000057"/> turer year, apparently totally devoid of
                        principle, and so easily influenced that the least temptation would lead him
                        to break resolutions which had been the result of deep penitence.
                           <emph>This</emph> was his greatest weakness—<emph>that</emph> his
                        greatest error.</p>
                     <p>His father was said to have been a very passionate man; but he was a member
                        of a presbyterian church, and we believe was greatly respected. He acquired
                        a very handsome fortune at the wholesale provision trade in Londonderry;
                        educated two of his sons at college in London, England, and indulged his
                        wife's and daughters' extravagant manner of living, till, in connexion with
                        the improper expenditures of his sons, he found his fortune fail him, and at
                        the early age of forty odd years he died, 'tis said mostly of a broken
                        heart. His reply, which 'tis said he always gave when asked concerning his
                        age, viz : "Few and evil have the days of the years of my life been," is
                        probably his best epitaph.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Binney was an excessively passionate or quick tempered woman; and this
                        peculiarity of disposition, which is so very apparent in every member of the
                        family, had foundation enough in the mother without attributing the same to
                        the father. To be thought much superior to the "common" class was seemingly
                        her greatest object in relation to her children; hence, to give them a
                           <emph>polished</emph> education was her only endeavor, while the solid
                        rudiments of learning were passed over.</p>
                     <p>In illustration of this we find them, when reduced to labor, after their
                        father's failure, learning embroidery, music and dancing, and buying season
                        tickets for balls, &amp;c., and at the same time one of them directing a
                        letter thus: "To Doctor W. J. Binney, Oregon Territory, Columbia River,
                        United States of America."</p>
                     <p>Dr. Binney, while at school in England, indulged in every excess of
                        dissipation to which London affords so many facilities. With liberty to draw
                        on his father's banker for sums of money when he pleased, and associating
                        with gay students in that gay metropolis, the vicious and reckless course
                        which he pursued was in exact keeping with his own inclinations, his
                        associates, and the place.</p>
                     <p>At length, having finished his education, fearing to await the arrival of
                        his father, he presented a draft of several hundred dollars on his father's
                        banker, and receiving the sum he took passage privately to Canada.</p>
                     <p>From here he obtained a situation as surgeon and physician in a government
                        vessel bound to the Pacific, and at California left her secretly, for what
                        reason we are unable to say, but we infer for some grievous offence, as his
                        mother wrote him some years afterwards thus:</p>
                     <p>"Mr.— was exceedingly anxious about his son, as he had learned that he left
                        the vessel in company with you, and that the officers pursued you for two
                        days and nights, intending to shoot you if they had overtaken you."</p>
                     <p>In California he sojourned some time, giving himself up almost exclusively
                        to the indulgence of vitiated habits. <emph>Once</emph> a gentleman who had
                        observed his skill in surgery offered him a lucrative situation, but was
                        again influenced to withhold it by the reports of Ewing Young of Oregon
                        against his character.</p>
                     <p>We pause just here to say, of all the evils to which society is subject we
                        consider that of meddlesome gossip to be the deadliest. How many persons has
                        this very evil ruined! who, but for it, would oftentimes have retraced the
                        erroneous path they had pursued, and rose to usefulness, respectability and
                        eminence—but <emph>by</emph> it have become discouraged and returned again
                        to their wallowing in the mire, till they were lost to the world and
                        perchance to hope!</p>
                     <p>Dr. Binney then betook himself to trapping beaver in the mountains, and
                        eventually started with a small party for Oregon overland, when the party
                        was defeated by the Indians, all the number being killed but five and the
                        beaver and horses all taken from the remainder. Two of these died in the
                        Umpqua, and three, Dr. Binney and two others, arrived in the Willamette
                        settlement about the year one thousand eight hundred and thirty five.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Binney was badly wounded by the blow of a tomahawk upon his chin, yet
                        was obliged with the others to pursue his way to Oregon on foot. He arrived
                        at the Methodist Mission at Willamette in a most distressed and forlorn
                        condition. The wound on his face, which was most severe, he had been
                        compelled to use his shirt to bandage; his shoes were worn out; his whole
                        clothing was lost but his pantaloons and vest, which was all that covered
                        him when he reached the mission.</p>
                     <p>Messrs. Lee and Shepherd were at home when Dr. Binney reached their house.
                        Rev. Messrs. Lees soon after took their horses and went away to hold
                        meetings in the settlement. Mr. Shepherd offered him one of the Indian boys'
                        shirts, and when he had tarried about two hours without any farther
                        attention being paid him, Mr. Turner, one of the three who had arrived the
                        evening before, came to the house and urged him to go to a Frenchman's with
                        him, "for," said he, with curses, "I came here yesterday, and not a bite of
                        anything would they give me." They went to a Frenchman's and received every
                        attention which it was possible to bestow.</p>
                     <p>Mr. J. Lee afterwards finding he was censured for neglecting to succor these
                        suffering persons, said he thought they would be there when he returned from
                        meeting, and then he intended to attend to their wants.</p>
                     <p>We have been informed that Dr. Binney was not sparing in his reproaches on
                        what he considered the censurable neglect of men professing piety, and,
                        moreover, whose avowed purpose in coming to the country was to benefit their
                        fellow men.</p>
                     <p>This misunderstanding between Rev. Mr. Lee and Dr. Binney was probably the
                        reason why the latter was not employed at some mission station on the return
                        of the former from the States, as he and Ruth Rover were led to expect at
                        the time of their marriage, and but for this encouragement, given by two
                        influential members of the mission, Ruth would not, we have heard her say,
                        have left the mission to marry, however great were her trials there.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Binney, having recovered from his wounds, went to California with a
                        party of the settlers and Mr. Edwards of the Methodist Mission, for a band
                        of cattle, and returned to the settlement in 1837, and took board with Dr.
                        W— of the mission. He, at this time, in speaking of himself, said his course
                        had been vicious through his whole life, but he wished to reform and try to
                        rise in the world. He readily found friends to assist him. Dr. White very
                        generously trusted him for board, and endeavored to encourage him in a
                        course of sobriety and industry.</p>
                     <p>Some time after he commenced the practice of medicine in the settlement, and
                        established himself at Champoeg.</p>
                     <p>In February, 1839, he was among the number of those who professed to have
                        met with a change of heart, during the revival at the mission. He connected
                        himself with the methodist church, and for a time was called "brother
                        Binney" and favored with all the honors of the sanctified. Pity some of
                        these encouragements could not be given when waywardness begins to
                        appear.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Edwards having brought very unfavorable reports of Dr. Binney's
                        character while travelling with him, Rev. Mr. Leland remarked that it was
                        "the best evidence he possessed that the work was of God that <emph>Dr.
                           Binney, a man who had been the very off-scouring of the earth</emph>, was
                        brought into the church."</p>
                     <p>There was another evidence, if he could only have thought of it, viz: that
                        of <emph>Wiley</emph> being so suddenly forgiven for the "crime" he had
                        committed, and received into such peculiar favor with the Almighty that "the
                        reformation was more indebted to him than to any other for its life." This
                        certainly was "<emph>depths of mercy!</emph>"</p>
                     <p>After this preparatory qualification, Dr. Binney offered himself in marriage
                        to Ruth Rover. She at first objected to leave the mission, but being told by
                        the superintendent, Dr. W—, that there was no doubt at all but on Mr. Lee's
                        return Dr. Binney would be requested to accept an appointment as physician
                           at<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC5702-00000058"/> some one of the mission
                        stations, and that meantime she would have a very extensive opportunity of
                        doing good among the sick in the settlement, she consented. The unhappy
                        dispute between her and Mr. Wiley was revealed to him in the way her enemies
                        pleased, and neither Ruth nor her husband knew how either had been deceived
                        till some time after.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Binney said the information he had received did not at all lessen the
                        esteem he entertained for Miss Rover, and some time after their marriage
                        requested Wiley to give him a written apology for the injurious report he
                        had caused to be circulated about his wife. Mr. Wiley said he would take the
                        paper home and consider about it. But Dr. Binney insisting it should be done
                        immediately, fell to cursing him, when Wiley put spurs to his horse and made
                        off in affright.</p>
                     <p>But let us to the wedding. It must be considered that Oregon was not in
                        those days as now. There were not at hand those magazines of goods which can
                        now be found in many towns in Oregon, where a bride may array herself "in
                        style." Or if there had been, we know not if Ruth would have availed herself
                        of any of these temptations, for she did not even dress as well as her
                        limited wardrobe would have enabled her to do, for we see her standing at
                        the altar in a <emph>green merino</emph> dress and a black and green
                        handkerchief about her neck.</p>
                     <p>The only witness to the ceremony, besides the parson's family, declared he
                        thought he was at a funeral.</p>
                     <p>Some of the Frenchmen and Indians who had been married by the missionaries,
                        had had wedding parties made for them—but at Ruth's wedding not even an
                        Irish wake was offered her.</p>
                     <p>Ruth was herself very sad. A few minutes before the ceremony was to be
                        performed, one of the mission family—the same officious person who had
                        wished her, when she first arrived, "to marry"—had said to her, "not one of
                        this mission family approves of your union with Dr. Binney."</p>
                     <p>"For what reason?" she asked.</p>
                     <p>"Why they say that you'll not live together long—they know his character and
                        temper, and think that <emph>you</emph> are too independent to bear with
                        him—and that your separation will be a disgrace to the mission."</p>
                     <p>"But why could I not have been informed of this before now? I have ever been
                        encouraged to accept his addresses."</p>
                     <p>"Why, they liked it very well when they considered that you'd have a home of
                        your own, and be much happier away than here—but <emph>now</emph> they think
                        your dispositions are so different that you can't agree."</p>
                     <p>"Well," said Ruth, "I'll not disappoint the man now, at this late moment,
                        even if I sacrifice myself to fulfill my engagement."</p>
                     <p>Immediately upon this she went to the altar. All the old <choice>
                           <sic>womens'</sic>
                           <corr>women's</corr>
                        </choice> bad omens she had ever heard she thought fulfilled at that time.
                        The day was rainy—pigs and chickens ran across her path—the ceremony was
                        performed with the parties standing the wrong way of the floor—the dogs
                        barked on her entering and leaving;—and what affected her more than all
                        this, she had accidentally read in scripture that morning: "Thou shalt be
                        ashamed of Egypt as thou hast been of Assyria—yea thou shalt go forth from
                        him and thy hands upon thy head."</p>
                     <p>But, <emph>did she love him?</emph> that's the question. We think not
                        particularly. She had asked a lady where he had boarded: "If you were single
                        would you marry Dr. Binney, provided he asked for you?"</p>
                     <p>The lady replied, with astonishment: "What! marry a mad dog? no indeed, I'd
                        live and die an old maid before I'd do that!"</p>
                     <p>Ruth remembered the expression, and several others she had heard, but
                        concluded that if her affections were not very great for him then, she could
                        not live with <emph>a husband</emph> and not love him, especially as he was
                        a <emph>christian</emph>. She anticipated great pleasure in religious
                        exercises with him, as he was a "young convert," and 'tis always supposed
                        that such are very devotional.</p>
                     <p>They left the mission house soon after the dinner bell had rung—neither one
                        having been invited to eat although they had fifteen miles to ride in the
                        rain. Mr. and Mrs. Shepherd and Mr. Whitcomb were at the head of the house,
                        and we are not sure there was any thing "to spare."</p>
                     <p>'Twas an interesting sight, that wedding party, that day, as Ruth Rover
                        plodded her way through the mud and rain, sometimes a quarter of a mile
                        behind her husband, who occasionally would halt and tell her to "come
                        along!" And Ruth went along behind her lord till they had arrived within a
                        mile of their home, when the husband requested her to "go ahead" and he'd go
                        into a neighbor's and see if his <emph>table</emph> was made.</p>
                     <p>He overtook her, however, before they reached the house, and very politely
                        said, to her, as he assisted her from the saddle, "this is our home."</p>
                     <p>"I'm very glad to reach it," she replied, "for I'm very tired."</p>
                     <p>The doctor soon made some tea in a tin kettle—fried some bacon and eggs—had
                        some good bread, made by an Indian woman—and set the whole, with some white
                        sugar, on the shelf beneath his few vials of medicine, which, as his table
                        had not come, served them very well. Ruth enjoyed the meal very much, as she
                        had not eaten since morning, and we presume the doctor did also, for he
                        amused her afterwards till half past nine with reading aloud in an old
                        English magazine, and laughing heartily at the jokes. But we had forgotten
                        he was religious! He did not, however, commence family prayers till
                        morning.</p>
                     <p>The bridal bed, as prepared by him, we had better describe somewhat, as
                        'twill show what bachelors had to bear in those days. The bedstead, made
                        with high posts and board floor, by a farmer, was really stylish for Oregon.
                        The doctor had borrowed a straw bed and one pillow, the latter covered with
                        deer skin, and the former covered in part with borrowed blankets. This was
                        very well, however, for a bachelor, inasmuch as he had evidently provided
                        the best he could.</p>
                     <p>Ruth began in the morning to look about the premises, and to apply herself
                        to whatever required to be done in her new home. The doctor read a chapter
                        in the bible and prayed "in his family," and the next morning did the same,
                        which was the last of this exercise—he telling his wife he <emph>could not
                           pray.</emph>
                     </p>
                     <p>He had taken a claim and erected a log house for which, with the chimney, he
                        was to pay one hundred dollars; he had two horses, a few articles of
                        clothing, a few dishes, two chairs, two blankets, and a kettle and frying
                        pan for cooking, which were all the possessions he could boast.</p>
                     <p>He told Ruth one day he thought he had done very well since he came into the
                        country two years before entirely destitute, for he had maintained himself,
                        accumulated a little property and only owed a few dollars at the fort and
                        seventy to Dr. White of the mission, which was due mostly for board. When
                        Ruth learned this, she requested him to take what was due to her there,
                        being fifty-nine dollars, toward paying it, and gave an order to that
                        effect. In this world's goods they certainly were both very poor—but what
                        matters it? they were industrious and willing to work.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Binney was an excellent surgeon and physician and was already very
                        popular with the French settlers, and there being no physician in the
                        settlement but himself and Dr. White of the mission, he soon had enough to
                        do. But wages were very low, and we have heard some persons complain because
                        he charged one dollar a day for himself and horse when travelling. He liked
                        the practice of his profession and to be out among the people, while Ruth,
                        wishing nothing to be neglected which would tend to improve their
                        circumstances, built the first pen for a pig, and laid the first
                           <unclear>rails</unclear> for a garden. She had an object in view in 'thus
                        giving her assistance to whatever required to be done, which she wished much
                        to be able to accomplish, which was to assist her husband in obtaining a
                        sufficiency to enable her to refund to the education society of Boston a
                        hundred dollars which they had expended for her at Wilbraham academy. She
                        considered this would be just and honorable inasmuch as she had left the
                        service of the mission before the time had expired for which she was
                        engaged.</p>

                                    is probably your duty to do so, but, far away as you are, we

                        like a general result or conclusion, for we fear we shall not be able to
                        continue these numbers to the extent at first intended, at least not till a
                        considerable number shall have been sold, in consequence of the great

                     <p>Let us say then at once, and rather abruptly, that Dr. Binney and his wife
                        were not very happy together after the third day of their marriage—but we
                        find not in all Ruth's journals and letters the least reference made to the
                        subject, except that she sometimes expresses unhappiness but does not give
                        the cause. Dr. Binney's impetuosity of temper and rashness of expression
                        often occasioned her great grief, and as she does not refer to
                           <emph>him</emph> as being the cause, <emph>we</emph> will not, at least
                        not at present—but we will tell the story of their lives very nearly as we
                        find it in the manuscript before us:</p>
                     <p>Of this, however, we are certain, Dr. Binney loved his wife ardently, and we
                        fully believe that but for the bad habits he latently indulged, overruling
                        him as they did, mostly through the influence of bad associates, that but
                        for these he might have been to this day living with and <emph>happy</emph>

                                 <p>"You probably have before this learned that I am married. In

                                    lesson learned the hermit will do for me, 'what you can't

                                 <p>"We live in a squared log house of two rooms on the ground
                                    floor, one fire-place, four windows, one piazza, one flight of

                                    inserting a new plant or seed where the chickens had picked up
                                    the first.</p>

                                    priests. One of them has a church in this settlement, the other
                                    itinerates from one place to another, teaching the people and
                                    Indians the catechism. The French catholics here have had Maria
                                    Monk's book, and lately expressed their fears of its truth to
                                    the Rev. Mr. B ——, the same probably of whom she speaks, when he
                                    told them the story had been forged at the instigation of a
                                    methodist minister who had seduced her! Romanism is coming in
                                    like a simoon.</p>
                                 <p>"To let you know how destitute we sometimes are, and how hard we
                                    find it to get our wants supplied, I will tell you that for some
                                    time back there could not be bought nor borrowed a sheet of
                                    paper in the whole settlement, and in the house not even a piece
                                    of waste paper large enough to wrap a vial, or a piece of cloth
                                    for a bandage. Husband keeps the house stripped of every thing
                                    he can use for the sick and afflicted, for 'tis in vain to look
                                    for anything in the form of comfort or convenience in a
                                    Frenchman's house. I had not even a towel to use, nor a pair of
                                    shoes, and they could not be obtained in the country. I resolved
                                    to bear it quietly, if such were my lot, when there came to hand
                                    a box of goods from a friend at Oahu—then your box, in which was
                                    also every needed article. So I believe our wants will be all
                                    supplied.</p>
                                 <p>"O! how grateful to my feelings is your christian counsel! I
                                    laid my head upon my pillow last night with uncommonly comforted
                                    and serene feelings, and even now I find my heart warm with
                                    placid and resigned emotions. What, of a terrestrial nature, can
                                    be compared to the hope of the gospel for producing in the human
                                    breast joys that decay not, though the heart be distracted and
                                    riven with earthly sorrow?</p>
                                 <p>"James thinks we have not much to eat. I can tell him better
                                    than that. Last eve we had for our meal some hasty pudding, a
                                    small bit of butter, some molasses and a cup of tea. This
                                    evening some more pudding, remains of pea soup, some fried
                                    cakes, with blue berries, tea, &amp;c. Our staple dishes have
                                    been, this summer, salt pork and coarse wheat bread, also tea
                                    when desired, and occasionally a cup of coffee. Poor as you may
                                    think this living is, we never repine for better, as with this
                                    we can satisfy hunger, and from it obtain strength to do our
                                    work. 'Tis often a matter of surprise to me that my husband
                                    never complains of this kind of fare. But he has for many years
                                    been accustomed to deprivations which would be hard to bear in
                                    your place, and here he seems to expect nothing different. 'Tis
                                    one satisfaction that he obtains for our use the best that can
                                    be obtained.</p>

                                    and attendance. When they left this morning, after being well
                                    paid for consenting to be thus benefitted, I offered the man
                                    pieces of flannel, thread and needles to mend his clothes, when

                                    died from abscess in the knee. During his sickness he gave
                                    abundant evidence of a mind at peace with God—attachment to his
                                    Master's cause—and happiness in the expectation of dissolution.
                                    Mr. Shepherd has without doubt been principally instrumental in
                                    gathering together the children of the mission school and taking
                                    the care of them—never shrinking from any employment, however
                                    debasing it might appear, which would promote <emph>their</emph>
                                    or the mission's good—at once washing, baking, scouring,
                                    mending, making, or teaching, as occasion might require. He had
                                    many infirmities or failings, without doubt increased or wholly
                                    brought upon him by his many cares and great labors.</p>

                                    attend the Lord's Supper, and although much fatigued in
                                    consequence, was well repaid by the delightful impressions I
                                    received in its observance. There is no duty in the church which
                                    I perform with so much pleasure or advantage as that of
                                    receiving the symbols of the Saviour's death. To feel forcibly
                                    impressed upon the mind the conviction that His blood washes us
                                    white from sin, and covers with a spotless robe these vile
                                    hearts of ours—'tis holy and heavenly delight.</p>

                                    perceive that Dr. White had succeeded in very much prejudicing
                                    this company against Rev. J. Lee. Dr. White and Mr. Lee have
                                    lately had a serious contention in which, 'tis reported, they
                                    gave each other the lie! and it has resulted in Dr. White's
                                    saying he will go to the States and have Mr. Lee deposed from
                                    being any longer the superintendent of this mission, and he is
                                    now making preparations to leave in the brig Maryland. A strife
                                    lately occurred between two members of this family, both
                                    preachers, in which a neighbor says they called each other
                                    liars, and used such language as was scandalous. An infidel
                                    remarks, 'tis pleasant to see brethren dwell together in such
                                    unity!'—doubtless 'twill result in great good, and many converts

                                    refuses to marry him.</p>

                                    that of embezzling the mission money, and was in consequence
                                    expelled from the church. Dr. W— is probably as guilty as has
                                    been represented, but these faults of his have been the subject
                                    of remark for some two or three years and have been passed
                                    lightly over, but now, when he is going to New York, as he says,
                                    'to expose Mr. Lee,' he is expelled the church to prevent his
                                    influence!—thus leaving the inference as unavoidable, that not
                                    for the offence was this done, but for the benefit of the injury

                     <p>"Some Indians have brought for sale some berries they have just been
                        picking. They appear not to know the difference in the days of the week; and
                        this is strange, as they have been living for three years in the parish of
                        the catholic priest. I bade them leave their berries and come to-morrow and
                        trade. We are living in about the centre of the catholic village, and my
                        infirmities keeping me mostly at home on the Sabbath, I have been able to
                        observe how the settlers employ their time on this holy day. I have known
                        them to cart and pack their wheat to mill, go for their flour, trade cattle
                        and horses, gamble, run races, &amp;c., on the Sabbath. This people are
                        mostly profane and intemperate, yet, for all this, they do not lose their
                        standing in the church! No wonder 'tis called the '<emph>Universal</emph>

                        my lungs, make me apprehensive of a pulmonary consumption, and I fear to
                        spend another winter in Oregon. Husband also thinks that the only chance for
                        my recovery is to effect a change of climate, and being induced to the step
                        by sundry other considerations, he has resolved to take passage with me to
                        the United States, intending, possibly, to return. Yet, I do not want to
                        go—my heart is knit to this people, although I have done so little for them,
                        and how gladly would I spend a long life to bring them to God!</p>
                     <p>"An interesting party of converted Indians from the Dalles, with Seletsee at
                        their head, have come here for the purpose of trading horses for cows. We
                        have offered Seletsee and his family a house to remain in over the Sabbath,
                        while the others encamp under the trees. He invited me in to join them in
                        their evening devotions, in which he took the lead. Speaking in Chenook I
                        was able to understand him."</p>

                                    hast preserved our health, and we are here in safety. We have
                                    every day had enough to eat and drink; and though, like the
                                    birds of the air, we have been for many days without house or
                                    home, yet Thou hast given us a home here in this house among
                                    good people, where we can rest through the Sabbath and find
                                    comfort.</p>
                                 <p>"I thank Thee for such a good day as the Sabbath day, when we
                                    can leave all our other thoughts, and think only of Thee.</p>
                                 <p>"Long ago my people spent the Sabbath like all other days, but
                                    now they know the difference. May my people who have come here
                                    with me, all stay in their tent to morrow and worship Thee.</p>

                                 <p>"Let Thy Holy Spirit wash the hearts again of those of my people
                                    who loved Thee at first but now have forgotten Thee.</p>

                     <p>A few extracts from letters may not be out of place here.</p>
                     <p>To her sister, Ruth says:</p>
                     <p>"You wish to know just when I expect to return to the States. I will tell
                        you fully and frankly my wish with regard to my return. I have not a desire
                        to see a civilized country 'till I have served the mission for the term of
                        six years; but whether I may again enter upon that service I cannot tell,
                        but will say I should not have married out of the mission but for the
                        encouragement given me that such would be the case. However, make up your
                        mind to see me before many years, for I have become satisfied that I cannot
                        enjoy health here, at least I cannot <emph>regain</emph> my health without a
                        change of air.</p>
                     <p>"I am very lonely here; have been married one year and five months, and have
                        not once been to a social meeting in that time. But we have occasionally
                        preaching in our house. I seldom see a civilized person but when they come
                        to meeting, and Indians, (I would they througed my path,) they only come
                        here when sent for medicine.</p>
                     <p>"How different is my state from what I thought it would be when I left
                        home—but I can do nothing better than to submit. If there are those in the
                        country who have wronged me and misjudged my nature, let the Lord recompense
                        them. There is a day coming when the hypocrite will be brought to shame, and
                        they who have oppressed the poor and ignorant will receive their just
                        desert."</p>
                     <p>"I will now tell you, brother I—, something about my success in
                        horticulture. People here begin to make gardens in February, and as we
                           <emph>two</emph> were made <emph>one</emph> in March, I was quite late at
                        that business. So, without waiting for a fence, or for husband to feel
                        disposed to help, I commenced turning the sod, and without mellowing or
                        rooting, I introduced the seeds, as thick as grains of flour in happy
                        porridge. The seeds were those I brought from home, and were many of them
                        two or three years old, so that I did not expect them to germinate, but they
                        came up like a host and could not grow for fighting. So Master Frost thought
                        he would remedy the matter, and passing over the beds one night, I found in
                        the morning the potatoes, and corn, and beans, and vines, all black with
                        wrath, and I did not much care for such quarrelsome things, if they were
                        dead. The beans thought to subdue him with love, and offered their
                           <emph>hearts</emph> to him, but it only made his work of destruction more
                        sure. The corn consented to become pleasant again if I would remove their
                        black looks; and the potatoes said they didn't care for him, for they were
                           <emph>well grounded</emph> in hope.</p>
                     <p>"This was my <emph>first</emph> attempt at gardening—maybe next time I'll do
                        better.</p>
                     <p>"Be very dutiful, my little brother, to your surviving parent, and render
                        her last hours smooth and happy by your filial attentions. Remember, too,
                        that you number <emph>one</emph> in the family of mankind, and endeavor to
                        have that <emph>one</emph> as good as any other."</p>

                     <p>AUGUST, 1842, Dr. Binney and his wife<pb n="124-125"
                           xml:id="VAC5702-00000063"/> took passage to the United States with Capt.
                        Couch, Brig Chenamus.</p>
                     <p>We are obliged to pass over nearly every note of this passage, and will just
                        say there were on board, besides themselves, Rev. Dr. Richmond and family,
                        Rev. Mr. Leslie and daughters, and Mr. and Mrs. Whitcomb.</p>
                     <p>In relation to the passengers, Ruth says, when out a few days:</p>
                     <p>"Three sly, slandering, venom-tipped tongues on board, with which I as much
                        dread to come in contact as with the poison of asps. With the character of
                        two I have been acquainted in former days, and another soon discovered
                        itself to be of the same woof; by stinging in my presence the fair
                        reputation of some with whom I happened to be acquainted."</p>
                     <p>Dr. Binney seemed much dissatisfied with the thought of leaving Oregon, and
                        his wife would at any step have been glad to have returned with him, had he
                        determined so to do.</p>
                     <p>At Oahu finding the passengers disagreeable, and an opportunity to go home
                        in another vessel presenting itself, he took passage with Capt. Price, in
                        the Java.</p>
                     <p>They passed some islands in the passage to Tahiti, from some of which the
                        men obtained specimens of coral and shells, and also tropical fruits.</p>
                     <p>At Tahiti they were obliged to wait for the vessel to repair, and meantime
                        enjoyed life very much in the society of residents and missionaries
                        there.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Binney, however, in an evil moment, when under the influence of wine and
                        the beguiling arts of false friends, decided on settling at Tahiti, and
                        expended nearly all the money he had in his possession, in purchasing
                        medicines which proved to be <emph>no</emph> medicines, but mostly empty
                        bottles. Expressing great dissatisfaction, those who had encouraged him to
                        the purchase recommended him to have the case decided by arbitration. Still
                        trusting those who were so free to <emph>treat</emph> him, he submitted to
                        their opinion—suffered them to choose arbiters for him, and found, on their
                        decision, that he must pay nearly three hundred dollars more.</p>
                     <p>He commenced practice but disliked the place and people, and at last
                        resolved, as the brig Chenamus had arrived on her way home, to have his wife
                        make a visit to her friends in the States, while he would sell his little
                        property there and return to Oregon. She consequently went on board, leaving
                        him with great regret, in a very dejected state of mind.</p>
                     <p>We make some extracts from letters she wrote him during the voyage:</p>
                     <p>"MY DEAR HUSBAND: Although we have been separated but two days, yet I would
                        rather see you this evening than any other person of whom I think. I am
                        quite unhappy when I remember how unpleasantly you are situated. Could I but
                        know you were on your way to Oregon I should consider you were in the way to
                        prosperity and safety. But, as you are, I know not with what new trials you
                        may have to contend, or what other enemies may unite together to ruin
                        you.</p>
                     <p>"We are favored with a fair breeze, and although many persons are about me I
                        take no pleasure but in anticipations of speedily doing my errand in the
                        States and returning to you."</p>
                     <p>"Much as before, lonely and unhappy. How much I wish that time, for once at
                        least, would hurry along. It seems in prospect a long <emph>long</emph> time
                        that is to pass before I can hear from you. I do indeed almost wish I had
                        remained in Tahiti where this anxious suspense about your destiny would have
                        been spared me.</p>
                     <p>"My <emph>dear husband</emph>—how unspeakably gratifying is the remembrance
                        that amidst so many enemies there is one in the world I can call
                           <emph>such</emph>—how I wish I could see you, and, instead of
                           <emph>writing</emph>, <emph>tell</emph> you what I would express. Would
                        you believe that this vile enemy of mine, Mrs. W—, (formerly Mrs. Shepherd)
                        has spread the bane of her hatred so far that Mrs. H—, the half-breed wife
                        of Captain H—, will not sit near me when she can avoid it, and has twice
                        moved her chair when I have been helped to a seat near her. Mrs. R—'s
                        friendship I do not wish and cannot accept, knowing as I do that she is a
                        back biter. I perform acts of kindness for her and shall continue so to do
                        during her illness, but not with a motive to obtain her favor. How
                        exceedingly do I find I have been injured by my enemies! and what shall I
                        do? Shall I still bear on and let their reports take the desired effect, or
                        shall I expose their plans against me and endeavor to regain that respect
                        which through them I have lost? I may indeed endeavor so to do, but I am
                        again alone! Yet I enjoy the pleasing reflection that when the secrets of
                        all hearts shall be revealed, it then will be known of me that I have been
                        accused of and made to confess faults of which I was never guilty, and all
                        because I could not help myself, and because the honor of my enemies could
                        not subsist unless mine were <emph>destroyed!</emph>
                     </p>
                     <p>"'Tis Sabbath below but not on deck—and Monday with you.<ref rend="super"

                        </q> And I think I prove something of the force of the remark, for if I had
                        not a being, an <emph>earthly</emph> being to love, how lonely at the
                        present moment would be my lot.</p>
                     <p>"I hope to be able during my absence from you, to improve every moment to
                        the best advantage, having your wishes concerning me, and yourself
                        constantly in my mind. Permit me to say you are ever in my thoughts, and
                        occupy in my affections the highest place next my God. I bear you on the
                        altar of my heart in my devotions, praying God to bless you and make you
                        happy. Man and wife have a right to be blest in each other's affections, and
                        may be, if they will suffer daily trifles to pass unnoticed.</p>
                     <p>"I am permitted the honor of instructing Mrs. H— in grammar, letter-writing
                        and reading; find her an interesting scholar.</p>
                     <p>"The two captains have been bringing me whale's teeth on which to sketch
                        designs to be etched with the pen-knife. I have thus prepared nine, which I
                        hope will be the last, for I find my eyes very weak, and I fancy my right
                        hand has too much exercise, and I cannot well give it rest until all my work
                        is done.</p>
                     <p>"I think that going to sea alone must produce a bad effect upon the
                        memory—perhaps <emph>good</emph> I should say—as I have forgotten all the
                        causes of disquietude which ever existed between us, and I can only think of
                        your kindness and love—which recollections afford me much pleasure.</p>
                     <p>"The lovely S— continues to monopolize the favors of the gentlemen by making
                        cakes and pies, and adorning her person, and although you have reason to
                        suppose me equally capable of such arts, yet I despise favor procured in
                        this way. If <emph>merit</emph> will not secure for me the regard of my
                        acquaintance, let me be without it, for favor purchased in this way is of
                        little worth. Do not fancy I am not noticed by the gents here, on the
                        contrary, they seem to be greatly my friends, but in my situation it is not
                        proper I should make intimates of them. I am more content alone in
                        remembering him whom none can condemn me for loving.</p>

                     <p>We think these extracts are sufficient to denote the affection Ruth Rover

                     <p>Ruth reached home in safety, and having passed six weeks very agreeably
                        among her friends, was anxiously awaiting letters from her husband, when she
                        was agreeably surprised at his arrival in New York—he having concluded,
                        after she had left Tahiti, to take passage to the States rather than to
                        return to Oregon without her. They left again in the same vessel, in 1843,
                        for Oregon.</p>
                     <p>We must also here pass over much which occurred during the voyage, and which
                        might be as interesting to the reader, as enabling him to obtain some idea
                        of life at sea, and confine ourself to such items only as will illustrate
                        and assist us in our object.</p>
                     <p>In the "diary" Ruth says:</p>
                     <p>"This morning, to the great joy of the whole house, Dr. Binney arrived. His
                        mother was particularly delighted, for she had felt great disappointment by
                        his not coming with me, as she feared she would never see him again. Dr.
                        Binney thinks it best to return to Oregon as soon as may be, and the object
                        for which I came (to improve my health) being accomplished, I am myself
                        anxious to return, as I consider that Oregon is my home."</p>

                     <p>Of Ruth's anticipations in returning to Oregon we have some indications, in
                        a letter to her mother, when she says:</p>
                     <p>"DEAR MOTHER: I have awaked as out of a dream and find myself actually on
                        the ocean destined to Oregon! I can, at this moment, hardly realize that I
                        have been in the United States—can hardly believe that I have seen my
                        mother, brothers and sisters, and again bade them farewell. It seems to me
                        some narcotic power must have pervaded my senses, or I could not have done
                        this so willingly—so forgetfully of the weariness of my life when separated
                        from them. But now, alas! I realize the dream has fled. To me again appears
                        a long, heavy, dreary course in this world, without a relation or friend to
                        animate, to bless my foot-steps. <emph>Now</emph>, indeed, I go, I know not
                        whither or wherefore—the future is all uncertainty and joylessness—and of
                        this I am assured, I must face the current—oppose the dangers—war with my
                        own feelings, and endure on till my change come. And what then? What shall I
                        have accomplished? Why, done that which I could not help, and have gone to
                        sleep singing "Victory!" How glorious such an exit!</p>
                     <p>"But, mother, don't suppose me wild. You have known my wish about my life,
                        and that now my hopes appear utterly blighted; and you know I can no
                           longer<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC5702-00000065"/> direct my own
                        course—perhaps best should not—for if an Almighty hand shall condescend to
                        control my fate, all will indeed be well. But I am not assured of the
                        watchful care of the Most High—and yet a secret, pleasant, comforter within
                        whispers "Trust." I do so, and resign my future walks to His guidance who
                        alone is capable of directing me. Do not be uneasy about me, I shall labor
                        to do good and to be good, that at last I may die in peace.</p>
                     <p>"Life on the ocean is very dull indeed, and the prospect of seven months
                        such living is painful. How much we wish <emph>you</emph> were here to talk
                        and keep us lively. Doctor finds society in the men, but I, ah! I must stay
                        below and be dull all by myself. I have work, O yes, a plenty, but I cannot
                        always work—and books, the cabin is half filled with them—the table, too, is
                        so frequently spread that one is quite tired of the rattling of knives and
                        forks—and anon the lamp is lighted, and darkness dawns, and dreams follow;
                        then the body becomes weary of lying—the mind experiences a sensation of
                        horror at daylight, that what was done the last day must be repeated the
                        coming day—and so the scene is, and will be repeated, till the heavy anchor
                        shall drop in Baker's bay."</p>
                     <p>From the journal of this voyage we make a few extracts:</p>
                     <p>"We are delightfully hastened on, as far as wind and waves are concerned.
                        Yet oh! how much I <choice>
                           <sic>fell</sic>

                        </choice> the need of a friend, a confidential friend, with whom I may
                        converse, and who would sympathise with all my feelings. But I consider
                        myself utterly alone in the world. Separated from every relation. I have,
                        perhaps, to finish my course in loneliness and intense deep seated grief.
                        Hitherto I had not one true friend in Oregon—many there were who loved to be
                        thought friends—loving to possess my confidence but only to betray it, and
                        expose my sorrows. On board the vessel I seldom speak, and conversation I
                        never partake! My thoughts, for need of expression, are become like a
                        stagnant pool, and my soul is overcharged with earthly matter, which it
                        needs unalloyed friendship to remove."</p>
                     <p>The reader will wonder at expressions like these, after reading the extracts
                        made from Ruth's letters to her husband on the passage home, when
                        considering that he was on board with her. But the cause is found in the
                        great dissimilarity of their dispositions, their wishes and pursuits.</p>
                     <p>"Just spent a profitable half hour at the window, in looking at the birds,
                        admiring them, and adoring their Creator. Here are the magnificent <choice>

                        all of them beautiful divers and entirely fearless of wind and storm.</p>
                     <p>"Just now was reading with deep feeling 'Scenes in a Court of Justice,' when
                        my husband brought me to read, and over which he had been for some time
                        greatly amused, '<title>An Irish Hulaballoo!</title>' So different are our
                        pursuits!</p>
                     <p>"More books brought me to-day. How are these trifling considerations
                        calculated to beget and expand esteem for those who bestow them! While I
                        would desecrate forever the narrow-minded man who would keep his books
                        nailed up during a seven months voyage, I would admire, for the same length

                     <p>"After many days of intense mental anguish, I was last eve enabled to
                        realize a blessing from God which yielded peace, faith and consolation to my
                        wounded spirit. I do not remember to have ever realized the Saviour of
                        sinners so near me. The same Son of David who walked about Gallilee,
                        Nazareth and Bethlehem, granting the requests of lepers, the blind, the
                        palsied, and the wretched of every class—the same Lamb of God who conversed
                        freely with the women of Canaan and Samaria, and many who were suffering the
                        reproaches of their enemies—seemed to be present in my little stateroom, and
                        to say, 'What wilt thou have me do?' My answer was, Lord deliver my life
                        from reproaches—my heart from sin, and come thyself and abide with me. I
                        experienced an almost overwhelming sense of His glorious presence and
                        willingness to accomplish for me all I asked—yet felt I must wait for
                        different events to transpire before they could all be attained. 'Hitherto
                        ye have asked nothing,' dwelt very forcibly upon my mind. <q>

                        Their majestic forms, reared in the midst of the ocean, impressed me with an
                        all-pervading sense of the magnificence of the Deity in their construction
                        and preservation. Here, too, are souls, immortal souls, as much under the

                        any in Europe or America—and to them has been manifested as great tokens of
                        His power in their redemption. Missionary zeal, in all its strength, was
                        awakened in my bosom when I contemplated that on these solitary shores are
                        numerous persons engaged in the evangelization of the heathen. Blessed work!
                        how do I long to be engaged in it—but I am prevented. Perhaps I am not
                        worthy of so distinguished an honor, and it becomes me to submit, though I
                        must do so with intense mental disappointment.</p>

                        and I made, the remark, 'I never read Byron without experiencing a degree of
                        sadness on my mind afterwards'</p>

                     <p>"'Then <emph>you</emph> have read it?' I asked.</p>
                     <p>She replied, blushing, 'yes; but I would never read it again. Such a
                        dissolute man! Such a wretched life he led!'</p>
                     <p>"'He undoubtedly committed many errors,' I replied, 'and he seemed to be
                        sensible of them, and in some measure at least to deplore them, when he

                     <p>"'Neither were <emph>mine,</emph> Mrs. —, but I pity the sorrowing, wherever
                        they are found, or from whatever cause they are sorrowed. Be they in prisons

                        although a Hawaiian woman, insisted on their remaining in her house during
                        their stay.</p>
                     <p>Next day the vessel was raised and the goods taken out. The furniture was
                        mostly ruined, and but a small part of their wardrobe could be restored.
                        After a detention of about three weeks they were again on board the
                        Chenamus, bound to the Columbia river. Dr. Babcock, and Rev. Mr. H—, and Mr.
                        Cushing, and some others in company.</p>
                     <p>We must pass over, also, the notes of this voyage, as well as of the time
                        spent at Oahu, and simply say in relation to Ruth, that, although she could
                        seldom please her husband, and this was apparent to every one about her, she
                        sometimes met those who would offer her a word of encouragement in the way
                        of praise.</p>
                     <p>At Oahu, in conversation with Mr. G—, the mate of the vessel, in <choice>
                           <sic>refering</sic>
                           <corr>referring</corr>
                        </choice> to the hatred of her enemies, and their slanders against her, she
                        said:</p>
                     <p>"Well, I can't help it. I do as well as I can, and must submit the
                        event."</p>
                     <p>"And so you do, Mrs. Binney," he replied. "By George! I never saw a woman do
                        better than you do. You have been in our vessel nearly a year, and I never
                        knew you to do anything wrong yet. By George! if I had a wife who did as
                        well as you do, I should think she was worth keeping; and I'm not the only
                        one who thinks so, either."</p>
                     <p>"Passing the reef, on the first view of the billows as they dashed over it,
                        I was favored with a delightful sensation of pleasure at the thought of the
                        grandeur and purity of the works of God, compared with those of men.</p>
                     <p>"Leaving the dissipated and unpleasurable town of Honolulu, I greeted with
                        delight the sublime ocean, which is capable at all times of subduing my mind
                        to a calm as tranquil and reflecting as its own, or raising it in tumultuous
                        breakings towards the Throne of God."</p>
                     <p>Of this voyage the captain remarked, it was the pleasantest he ever made,
                        both as regarded the weather and the company.</p>
                     <p>During the voyage to the Columbia river, Ruth amused herself, as usual,
                        mostly in her state-room alone—writing rhyme,—journalizing,—paraphrasing
                        psalms, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>As an evidence that she could, at one time, scarcely think "straight," as
                        she termed it, we will admit the following, which was conjured in her mind
                        while waiting for the people to come to the table, and as giving some idea
                        of life at sea.</p>

                        <hi rend="i"/>May. 1844. "Arrived at the falls. Very pleasing associations
                        arise in my mind as I realize I am again in the Oregon and among the people
                        of my choice, viz: The Indians. Rev. Mr. H— told me on the passage here that
                        once being requested to preach to the Clackamas Indians, they consented to
                        have him provided he would talk <emph>good</emph> talk, and when he
                        commenced by telling them their hearts were bad, they said they had heard
                        enough, and commenced going out.</p>
                     <p>"An Indian woman tells me to-day that the reason why the Indians will not
                        hear the missionaries is because they have heard that the people of the
                        United States have sent them clothing, and they not having received it, they
                        say their own hearts are as good as the white people's hearts.</p>
                     <p>"Situated again on our former place, for which Dr. Binney has paid seven
                        hundred dollars, although when we left two years ago he sold it for three
                        hundred.</p>
                     <p>"The people have organized a form of government and laws corresponding with
                        those of the Territory of Iowa. Dr. Binney, on his return, was elected one
                        of the three governors, styled the executive committee. A light tax of
                        twelve and a half cents on a hundred dollars has been levied on the people
                        for the support of government. A law framed by missionaries prohibiting all
                        settlers, <emph>except missionaries,</emph> from holding a land claim on

                        covered the ground for nine days. Pigs, chickens and cattle have frozen to
                        death; and in one instance a child, on being out with its parents, was so
                        severely injured with the cold that it died in a few days.</p>
                     <p>"An acquaintance, who has been on his farm about one year harvested last

                        brother and partner went to California last fall, and has he writes him,
                        obtained fifteen hundred dollars in gold! So much for perseverance and
                        prudence. Another, formerly a neighbor, for some time in California, has
                        plenty of gold sometimes, yet spends it as fast as he gets it, and goes
                        about in rags, drinking and gambling.</p>

                        gave ten dollars for two; they jumped the fence and got away, and the male
                        got a limb broken in being caught again, when I nursed him three weeks in
                        the hospital, feeding him daily with water and grass. Next the mother of the

                        cannot myself cut oak, and the snow prevents me from going to the woods to
                        get any other. A gentleman called, and laughing at my fire, said the Indians
                        differ from bears only in the fact that Indians can build a fire and bears
                        cannot. Wonder if he thought me a bear because I had no better fire? I did
                        not tell him what I thought of him for not offering to cut me some wood.</p>

                        could not refuse as he is an acquaintance of my husband.</p>
                     <p>"Dr. — left this morning, after breakfast, without a 'thank ye,' although I
                        had made no charge for his accommodations or his horse's feed. On going into
                        the stable to see if all was right there for husband's return, I found about
                        eight bundles of oats partly eaten and trampled under his horse's feet. For
                        this I shall be blamed for suffering him to help himself. Like many others,
                        I presume Dr. — left his manners at home, thinking they would not be
                        appreciated by us country people. We often have such visitors from Oregon
                        City. Our place being half way to Salem, and twenty-five miles from either,
                        'tis a very convenient resting place for man and beast, especially as there
                        never yet was anything charged for the accommodation—for we always receive
                        our pay in a very gracious invitation to visit them when in Oregon City—but
                        when we happen to be in their town we are never recognized, and 'tis not
                        known that we have been about them till we are gone.</p>
                     <p>"A man calls to see our place; says he heard it was for sale. I told him
                        husband offered it for six thousand dollars—the cattle and household
                        furniture being included; he is to consider.</p>
                     <p>"During Miss C—'s stay here we have set out two hundred and forty six scions
                        of apples and peach trees in my garden, for her mother, when they shall have
                        settled on a farm.</p>

                        member of the legislature. He has paid sixteen dollars it in cash for his
                        board—four for his passage—was absent a week to the same last December—lost
                        all his practice meantime, and received for his pay thirty-eight dollars in
                        Oregon scrip'. Costly honor! Previously to the sitting of the legislature
                        this year, great exertions were made to elect members who would vote to
                        change the Organic law sufficiently to insert <emph>prohibit</emph> instead
                        of <emph>regulate</emph> into that clause relative to ardent spirits. but
                        several who promised their constituents that they would vote for the change
                        have opposed it, and the law reads as formerly. The majority of the members
                        of this session are unprincipled men, at least if we may judge by their
                        works. They have also, on the petition of J. Brooks, divorced his wife. Only
                        three of this body voted against this barbarous decree, and thus prove they
                        have no sympathy with woman kind. This business has been accomplished mostly
                        by a lawyer who has not much to do, and is the same person who recommended
                        Mrs. Brooks, formerly, to apply to court to obtain a bill from her first
                        husband. Mr. Brooks is to furnish her five hundred dollars. She boards in
                        the country, and Dr. Binney attends her.</p>

                        these accomplishments are more easily learned than the spelling book, and

                        it, but find it too weak to walk. Doctor then took it in his arms, when the
                        cow flew at him; he then took it upon his saddle, when she ran off to the
                        woods to look for it. Getting her upon the road again, I tried my skill,
                        raising the calf in my arms and walking backwards that the cow might see it.
                        This was troublesome, too, for every time I raised it from the ground the

                     <p>"How beautiful is nature! I thought, this evening, as I leaned over the yard
                        fence. The sun had descended midway the trees before me—the ground was
                        sprinkled with the late rain—the oak trees at either end of the house and in
                        and out of the yard are full of flowers, hanging in tresses with young green
                        leaves—three turtle doves in the open yard before me are walking about
                        picking whatever they can find, and talking the sweetest language ever heard
                        by mortal—my cats, two on the fence on either side of me, brushing my arms
                        with their furs and asking me to notice them, while the other was on the
                        ground waiting a chance to jump up beside me—young pigs running about in a
                        frolic—horses and young colts eating salt—cows coming up to their calves to
                        be milked, while the calves, twenty three in number, were racing from the
                        opposite side of the pasture to the kraal, to their mothers, each one trying
                        which would get there first. Yes, how beautiful is nature! the weather, too,
                        is fine.</p>

                        having but poor feed in the pasture, I think I'll take them into the garden
                           <unclear>where is</unclear> better grass, and sit under the trees and
                        read meantime—believing 'it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath day.' Soon
                        find them running about over the young trees and beds, &amp;c.; try to turn
                        them out, but no! they liked the place too well, and began to make it a play
                        ground—thinking, perhaps, it is lawful for <emph>horses</emph> to play on
                        the Sabbath. Have at last to call for help <unclear>to subdue</unclear> fun
                        and return them to the <unclear>barren</unclear> pasture. For once I think
                           <unclear>satan has</unclear> been transformed into an angel <unclear>of

                        <emph>such</emph> kind of good on the <unclear>Sabbath</unclear>. I think
                        the horses will be hungry before my sympathies will let them into the garden
                        again.</p>
                     <p>"Rose soon after daylight to let my cows go. The woods echoed with the notes
                        of mourning doves and birds singing charmingly their morning songs. Being
                        unable to milk twenty-three cows alone twice a day, I milk them at evening
                        and leave them with the calves all night, turning them out early and the
                        calves to their pasture.</p>

                     <p>"Dr. Binney is at last ready for his tour to California. He leaves me on the

                        would not stay only that she desires me to instruct her in reading, and I
                        dare not refuse, and I know of no place in the country where she could find
                        accommodations.</p>
                     <p>"Dr. Binney leaves two thousand dollars in my care, and when bidding me
                        farewell told how he wished I would dispose of it in case of his death.</p>
                     <p>"I asked him, if the case should be the other way, and <emph>I</emph> should
                        die, will you give the Missionary Education Society one hundred dollars for

                        enormous fir tree, as I gazed upwards and caught a glimpse of the sky
                        through the tops of trees, I found my mind at peace with God—at peace with
                        nature—and at peace with itself. Only a few of mankind caused me a bitter
                        reflection. My faithful dog Cæsar kept running about on the scout for wolves
                        and, as the hoosiers say, for 'varmints,' so that I reposed securely. My
                        lonely bird was there over my head, its only note chirp, chirp. Thought of

                        upright when falling, and birds mourn their mates—what would they say is

                        which I think much more resembles the Passion scene of the Crucifixion than
                        the real passion flower. It is in about the form of a cup, of the size of
                        half an egg. In the centre stands the pericarp, which ends at the top in
                        three points in the form of a cross. Close around are six stamens—three
                        large and three small—which may represent the immediate favorite disciples
                        of the Lord, male and female. Around the bottom of the pericarp, and cross
                        is a smooth space on the white petals, thickly spotted with fine purple
                        spots, which may be considered blood and the shade of the surrounding
                        multitude. There are three petals thickly studded on the inside with small
                        white points—the people assembled; those nearest the cross are tinged with
                        purple, the mourners in grief—and the others being white denote
                        carelessness. Three leaves, the covering of the calx close the opening
                        between the petals and resemble a guard, and the three long slender leaves
                        on the stalk remind one of the long continued blessings of the sacrifice and
                        the union of the Godhead. The flower is very beautiful, and whatever others
                        may call it <emph>I</emph> shall name it Oregon Passion Flower.</p>

                        Binney, in Spanish, what was "<hi rend="i"/>Thank You,' in English. The
                        doctor, being busy at the moment and not wishing to be annoyed, told him to
                        'Go to h—ll.' Assisting him in the garden, I told him I had sown all the
                        seeds he had given me when he raised his hand to his mouth and with a polite
                        bow replied, 'Go to h—ll, Senora.' I could not comprehend his meaning till I
                        obtained the explanation from my husband.</p>
                     <p>"Doctor sold his band of mares and colts at twenty-five dollars per head,
                        and this spring's colts given in the sum amounting to five hundred dollars.
                        About twelve or fourteen of them were my own.</p>
                     <p>"This is a great relief to me of the anxiety I have felt when they have
                        suffered without food in winter, and from the envy of neighbors.</p>
                     <p>"He has also sold the band of cattle at twenty-five dollars per head,
                        excepting this spring's calves, amounting to two thousand and four hundred
                        dollars—one hundred being thrown off for the risk of some which may not be
                        found.</p>
                     <p>"These animals have all come from three cows, being all that were ever
                        purchased of the stock. The balance I have taken care of when calves,
                        milking the cows and attending to the calves, so that the whole band are as
                        tame as any ever seen in the United States.</p>
                     <p>"This is also a great relief, as what we lose by men and wolves is about
                        equal to the increase; and Dr. Binney is unable to look after them, and he
                        is constantly saying they are more trouble than they are worth.</p>
                     <p>"Commence keeping a purse of my own separate from my husband's. Begin with
                        the silver dollar, my fortune from my father, four dollars given me for a
                        bonnet, and thirteen particles of gold dust picked from the table after
                        doctor had been weighing some. Hitherto all I have earned or received for
                        any article belonging to myself, has been given to him.</p>

                        supported by the conscious integrity of my own heart.</p>
                     <p>"About forty-three head of our cattle which were sold this spring and driver
                        some distance towards Rogue river, have swam the rivers and returned to our
                        place. One cow came with her young calf to the gate of the kraal, and would
                        not go away till it was taken inside. It has since been twice put out to
                        her, but she will not go away with it. Mooley insists on it remaining in my
                        care.</p>
                     <p>"Another cow actually succeeded in getting her calf into the corral, but how
                        we cannot tell, we only know we found it there.</p>
                     <p>"'Tis gratifying that dumb animals at least can believe there is goodness in
                        me.</p>
                     <p>"Some French neighbors have bought barouches—undoubtedly their Indian wives
                        will now <emph>out-shine</emph> the white ladies.</p>
                     <p>"With what increasing delight do I contemplate the ways of God to man: our
                        destiny—immortality—the delights of religion, and the prospect of an eternal
                        increase of knowledge and joy in God. 'O! how love I Thy law—it is my
                        meditation day and night!' I often feel disposed as now to break out in
                        songs of praise and gladness, but the shadow of coming distressing events
                        forbids the utterance of my secret joys and hopes in God.</p>
                     <p>"Some prospect of soon leaving for the United States, at which prospect my
                        heart bounds within me.</p>
                     <p>"Since I have been in this country 'the snares and pains of hell,' as the
                        psalmist says, 'have had hold upon me,' but should God deliver me, as I
                        shall think he does when I am permitted to leave Oregon, my life henceforth
                        is to be the Lord's. Whatever opposition, persecution and deprivation I may
                        meet, my constant purpose shall be to serve God and His cause in every
                        possible way.</p>
                     <p>"I have felt much this morning of the consecrating influences of the Holy
                        Spirit, instigating, accepting and sanctifying this resolution made from
                        these considerations. This life is of but little use but to prepare for the
                        next. After this life is ended I have to live forever in happiness or woe.
                        My bliss hereafter will be proportioned to my capacity for enjoyment, or, in
                        other words, to the amount of favor I shall receive of God for the way in
                        which I have served him here. And this life being passed and lost, can never
                        be recovered and spent again.</p>

                     <p>THE reader having accompanied us in our rapid examination of Ruth Rover's
                        journal, during a term of six years, in which we have quoted only such items
                        as would illustrate her employment and the tenor of her mind, we shall ask
                        his indulgence now, while we contemplate a different subject, viz: the
                        improper course of Dr. Binney—a subject as painful to the compiler to record
                        as it must have been painful to Ruth to witness; and for the feelings which
                        inspire the compiler, in view of this part of her task, she must refer her
                        reader to the first part of the "Introduction" at the commencement of this
                        number.</p>
                     <p>We believe we have stated somewhere that Dr. Binney's greatest error was a
                        want of principle, and his greatest weakness a too ready yielding to
                        impressions.</p>
                     <p>We have no antipathy toward Dr. Binney as an individual; we respect him for
                        his good qualities—pity him for his errors—and most sincerely lament that
                        state of mind into which he has fallen, by which he cannot maintain a good
                        purpose nor avoid the ruin which he perceives so glaringly before him.</p>
                     <p>Without the aids which the love and fear of God produces, he has no strength
                        to enable him to keep a good resolution but the regrets of a past error
                        while fresh in his mind—and these are rendered powerless from the effects of
                        evil associates and intoxicating drinks, which are ever resorted to to
                        assuage the pangs of an outraged conscience.</p>
                     <p>On Dr. Binney's associates will fall the heaviest punishment due for his
                        ruin—on those who, to obtain his gold or services, or property, or
                        influence, or from jealousy, have been the most active in alluring him again
                        to scenes and habits of dissolution, from which he had endeavored to escape.
                        And in this chapter we shall fearlessly refer to such, and as far as our own
                        influence extends, shall expose their names to obloquy and contempt.</p>
                     <p>Could writing send such persons sooner to the oblivion which they deserve,
                        and which is before them, <emph>our</emph> feeble efforts should not be
                        wanting—but the earth is and <emph>ever will</emph> be cursed with their
                        foul presence. Shame and exposure but makes them more intent on their
                        purpose, for then they are goaded on by revenge, as we have met many
                        instances in our contemplation of the evils to which Ruth Rover has been
                        subject from this class of individuals—and our only hope is in the justice
                        of that decision which will hereafter be made against them.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Binney's religion lasted during two seasons of prayer with his wife. He
                        then told her he <emph>could not</emph> pray; and shortly after told her,
                        when she was entreating him most fervently to continue his efforts to be
                        religious, that he did not mean to pray, and furthermore he did not intend
                        to remain a member of the church, and she night make herself easy.</p>
                     <p>The third morning after their marriage he told her she was a pest, in
                        consequence of her having made an enquiry relative to a friend of his, but
                        which she had no suspicion he would be unwilling to answer.</p>
                     <p>In a week he was cursing his horse, notwithstanding his profession of
                        religion; and, as an evidence of the precipitancy of his temper, in
                           <emph>three weeks</emph> after marriage he attempted to strangle his
                        wife, by seizing her by the back of the neck, and for which she was entirely
                        off her guard, not having yet learned his disposition.</p>
                     <p>When he retired at night, he asked her what she thought of his conduct that
                        day. She replied she did not know what to think of it! He told her he wished
                        her to think no more about it, for he could not tell what ailed him
                        sometimes to make him act as he did.</p>
                     <p>But 'tis needless to attempt to delineate every circumstance of this kind
                        which occurred. We only wish to notice such as will denote Dr. Binney's
                        disposition and general course, an explain some occurrences which are
                        imperfectly understood.</p>
                     <p>The impetuosity of his temper was equally apparent in shooting his horses
                        and hogs—in breaking his furniture—in destroying his clothing—as in
                        mistreating his wife: with this difference, however, that while an animal
                        could die, or furniture be repaired, or clothing be restored, his wife had
                        to endure her griefs uncomplainingly, or breathe them only to herself with
                        the oft-repeated exclamation:</p>
                     <p>"<emph>What have I married?</emph>"</p>
                     <p>At this time Ruth indulged hope that it would not always be thus with him.
                        Perhaps she thought 'twas the loss of religion, and in all her prayers to
                        heaven she besought God to influence him by His good spirit and save him.
                        Perhaps she thought, too, 'twas poverty which irritated him, and she bent
                        all her energies to assist him to become in easy circumstances, by denying
                        herself every article she could do without—by laboring with her own hands to
                        save expenses in hiring, and in earning all she could by needle-work, which
                        was always given to her husband; but these were of no avail—if she labored,
                        it was, he said, because she had been always used to it, and 'twas a sign of
                        her low origin—if she worked at needle-work, it was, he said, to obtain
                        favor of other men, and not to please him—and if she bore his reproaches
                        without reply, it was, he said, because she was a d—d coward, and knew she
                        was in the fault.</p>
                     <p>Ruth had flattered herself that he was cured of intemperance, but she was
                        destined to be disappointed here, for having a good pretext for obtaining
                        liquor from the fort, viz: "for medical purposes," she discovered his wish
                        to indulge to excess, and many times subjected herself to his violence from
                        her wish to save him by removing the cause of danger.</p>
                     <p>During the period of her ill health, when she was unable to wait on herself,
                        he sometimes was exceedingly kind and attentive to her, and bore his own
                        privations and labors with great patience; and at other times in his
                        rashness he would dash the remedies he had prescribed away and leave her
                        with curses and destitute of assistance.</p>
                     <p>In this way six years had passed, and Ruth saw no remedy for the restoration
                        of her husband but to remove him, if possible, away from evil influence, and
                        place him where that of the moral and religious would predominate. With this
                        hope, and the wish to benefit her health, or to remain with her friends,
                        Ruth encouraged him to go to the United States in 1842.</p>
                     <p>The doctor, by industry and perseverance<pb n="148-149"
                           xml:id="VAC5702-00000075"/> ance, had obtained a handsome sum, and Ruth
                        also, by industry, prudence and economy, had greatly assisted him in
                        acquiring and saving it, and this was sufficient to have borne their
                        expenses home and to have enabled them to return, but for his foolish
                        expenditure at the Society Islands, by which he lost about seven hundred
                        dollars, and which caused him on his return, to be greatly straightened in
                        pecuniary affairs.</p>
                     <p>During this visit to the States, R. was greatly desirous that the good
                        impressions Dr. B.'s family had received of his reformation should not be
                        interrupted. but his hasty spirit soon manifested itself, in occasioning
                        offence to the members of the household, and resulted in his mother and
                        sisters telling him he was no longer welcome there. He left them and passed
                        the remainder of his time mostly with Ruth's mother, a period of several
                        weeks While here and visiting among her friends, they discovered, to R.'s
                        great mortification, that Dr. Binney was a man of intemperate habits, and
                        rash and dangerous in his temper. In a sudden passion, he abandoned his wife
                        at her mother's, taking his clothing, and affirming she should never see his
                        face again, he left to take the cars, but being too late, he returned, asked
                        her forgiveness, and next morning was equally anxious for her to prepare to
                        return to Oregon with him.</p>
                     <p>Being returned to his old place and practice, the temptations and besetments
                        which had before allured him to the committal of error, were greatly
                        increased. He could scarcely ride for a day without encountering some who
                        made or sold liquor; and, ever as ready to drink as to pay his own and
                        others expenses, he was a very agreeable addition to the numbers of those
                        who sought these remote hovels for the commission of iniquity—for gambling
                        and inebriation. But an unnecessary expenditure of money, and absence from
                        home was not the worst feature of this course. Ruth had, during his absence,
                        been compelled to attend to all the business on the place; whether the care
                        of cows, horses, swine, poultry, or garden, or housework—she was the sole
                        manager, and almost always the sole laborer on the place. And when she had
                        spent days and nights in loneliness and toil for his benefit, the most cruel
                        part of his course was ingratitude on his return. Many times has she been
                        first apprised of his approach by hearing most profane curses heaped upon
                        her before he reached the house, at the supposition of something which he
                        thought had been neglected. And, on entering the house, it was not with any
                        affectionate salutation, which would have rewarded her for all her toils,
                        but with sullenness, or reproaches, or accusations of some evil of which she
                        had never thought, or the repeatal of some slander her enemies had furnished
                        him with. If his meals were not in readiness, which was impossible
                        oftentimes, from the irregularity of his hours, all the dishes he could find
                        would be broken—if he could see nothing but tea or coffee in readiness, he
                        would kick it into the fire, or dash it across the room. If everything was
                        on the table, and he were invited to eat—if his wife had not cried herself
                        into a merry mood in the course of the day, after his abuse in the morning,
                        the whole affair of victuals and dishes would be swept into the fire, and
                        herself ordered out of the house for her "d—d sullenness." Extremely wearing
                        and prostrating was it to soul and body to live thus, and <choice>
                           <sic>ofentimes</sic>
                           <corr>oftentimes</corr>
                        </choice> Ruth's powers of endurance being entirely exhausted, she would go
                        to a neighbor's house to pass a few days, to regain an equilibrity of
                        feeling, by which she might again pursue her labors, or retire for a few
                        hours or a day to the grove, and endeavor by relaxation, to forget the
                        keenness of her sorrows; but although they might be overcome for that
                        time—yet the cause being not removed—she had to realize their renewal, and
                        each time find herself driven nearer and nearer to despair.</p>
                     <p>Oregon was then, not as now, when facilities for travelling are so greatly
                        multiplied, and what would appear <emph>now</emph> a very rash undertaking,
                        could be contemplated <emph>then</emph> with some hope of success,
                        especially if <emph>necessity</emph> should seem to warrant the attempt.</p>
                     <p>Ruth Rover, before Dr. Binney had determined to once more return to the
                        United States, had many times contemplated the subject of leaving him and
                        endeavoring to return to her friends. She was satisfied her life was being
                        wasted—she was being of no service to her husband only to enable him to
                        acquire money to waste—hopes of his reformation she did not in the least
                        indulge while he lived in Oregon; and as he had been home once and was not
                        contented to remain, she thought it of little use to encourage him to go
                        again unless he was willing to remain; and as his practice was extensive, he
                        had abundance for his support in his farm and stock. Ruth often thought that
                        she could relinquish every right which she held to the property, if she
                        could again regain her friends and be permitted to live in peace and
                        quietness among them.</p>
                     <p>But how could she get there? Dr. Binney would never furnish her the means,
                        and she could never attempt such a long voyage at sea alone, even if she
                        could have gone on the credit of her friends East. In these perplexities,
                        and driven to extremes, she sometimes thought she could travel all the
                        distance by land; or, if she could reach Walla Walla, she could remain till
                        an opportunity presented itself for her to go home.</p>
                     <p>But impracticable, of course, were all these schemes, and her only course
                        was to <emph>endure</emph>—and <emph>she</emph> thought to endure on till
                        death should end her sorrows.</p>
                     <p>Persons there were in the neighborhood who loved to lead Dr. Binney into
                        intoxication for the certainty, as they thought, of the disturbance which
                        would ensue between him and his wife, when he, at variance with her, would
                        accept of friendship from any one, and would be in the best humor to lend
                        money, or give away property, or sell it at an under price, for the sake of
                        friends to uphold him in his conduct to her.</p>
                     <p>John Hord of Champoeg, was of this class. Being of the same country as Dr.
                        Binney, viz: an Irishman, his invitations to "come in and drink" were never
                        disregarded, and when once there he seldom left till he had been all the
                        rounds of sin and <emph>weariness</emph> induced him to seek his own home
                        for <emph>repose.</emph>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another of this class was Robert Newhall, and to manifest his duplicity we
                        shall cite one case out of many.</p>
                     <p>R. Newhall had been a member of the legislature, and on Dr. Binney's return
                        to Oregon in 1843, the French settlers, ever great friends to
                           <emph>him</emph>, nominated and supported him in the office of governor,
                        or one of the three persons in the executive committee. After this they
                        elected him to the legislature greatly to the annoyance of R. N. During
                        this, Mr. Newhall visited at Dr. Binney's and pretended great friendship,
                        while he was always received by Mrs. Binney with kindness and treated with
                        attention. At a caucus meeting in the settlement, previous to the struggle
                        of the people to introduce the word <emph>prohibit</emph> instead of
                           <emph>regulate</emph> into the organic law as relating to liquors, Dr.
                        Binney and Mr. Newhall were both nominated as candidates for the
                        legislature, on the promise that they would vote for
                        "<emph>prohibit.</emph>"</p>
                     <p>On retiring, Mr. <choice>
                           <sic>Newhell</sic>
                           <corr>Newhall</corr>
                        </choice> invited Dr. Binney to come to Champoeg that evening. He went to
                        Mr. <choice>
                           <sic>Newhell's</sic>
                           <corr>Newhall's</corr>
                        </choice> house, and was invited to go to "John's," and when there was urged
                        to drink, and having done this once, needed no more urging, but continued,
                        with the occasional example of Mr. Newhall, to drink until he forgot all
                        danger, and with him remained, drinking and gambling till daylight on
                        Sabbath morning, when he returned home and took his bed.</p>
                     <p>Ruth rose as usual and attended to her cows and duties about house, and
                        having promised two half-breed girls she had living with her that they
                        should go to meeting that day at a neighbor's, she prepared them to go. Dr.
                        Binney, somewhat recovered from a state of inebriation, said they should not
                        go. Ruth ascertained that his only objection was that he hated the man at
                        whose house the meeting was to be held, and as she had, in compliance with
                        his wish in this respect, never attempted to go there herself, and the
                        children being deprived of all indulgence of this kind which they enjoyed at
                        home, and as she had faithfully promised them that they should go that day,
                        replied to Dr. Binney that his<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC5702-00000076"/>
                        wish to keep her and the children from indulging in recreation of that kind
                        could not be always indulged—that she stayed away herself to gratify him,
                        but the children could do no harm by going, and it was her intention to have
                        them go to meeting sometimes when there was opportunity.</p>
                     <p>He became enraged, and thrust them and her out of the door, telling her to
                        go with them, and never enter his house again.</p>
                     <p>The children went to church, and found, on their return, they were not
                        permitted to enter the house. Mrs. Binney had gone from the sun, and from
                        the gaze of strangers, to the hospital, an unfinished log house on the
                        place.</p>
                     <p>Sometime after, the children were told to go into the house, and Dr. B.
                        going to the house where his wife was, told her to leave it and the place,
                        or he would burn it down over her head. She remained all night without
                        bedding or covering, having attended to her cows and calves as usual. In the
                        morning Dr. Binney called at her door, and told her if she wanted her
                        clothing to go for it, for he was going away and wished to shut up the
                        house. She went, and took a few articles, which were taken from her again as
                        she went out of the door—her husband saying, "No, I'll be d—d if you'll come
                        that game over me." When he had gone away, she secured some clothing and
                        some bedding and concluded to remain where she was if the children would
                        bring her food; and attend her garden, and milk the cows, make the butter,
                        &amp;c., all of which she could do without going into the house where Dr.
                        Binney was, and if these things were neglected, she was well aware there
                        must be great waste. At evening, after having milked the cows, and being
                        about to carry the milk to the dairy, she saw Dr. Binney leaving her house
                        with the clothing and bedding she had carried there, and her bundle of
                        manuscripts and journals which she feared he would destroy. She went for
                        these, and he refused to give them up. He told her again she should leave
                        the place—or he would take straw and burn the house over her head—that "not
                        a d—d article of her clothing should she have"—and that the girls should
                        bring her "no more food, for if he caught them at it he would break their
                        heads," Ruth passed another uncomfortable night—having eaten nothing since
                        dinner but some strawberries; and pondering on the course which appeared
                        most proper for her to pursue, she could not think it right for her to
                        remain there, for certainly she could not subsist without food; although she
                        would willingly have submitted to deprivation for the sake of attending to
                        her cows, it being the early part of summer, when the milk was so abundant
                        that the calves could not drink it, and the cows were liable to injury by
                        not being milked. She told Dr. Binney, that notwithstanding his ill
                        treatment on Sabbath morn, she had resolved to remain for this purpose; and
                        if she could not live with him—to live by herself where he would not be
                        troubled with her presence; but he told her he had engaged a person to take
                        care of the cows, and he did'nt want her on the place, and she should not
                        stay on it at any rate. Early in the morning she walked on foot through the
                        dew to an acquaintance's house in Champoeg, and from thence found her way to
                        the Falls. After she had gone, Dr. Binney went to Champoeg and posted upon
                        the blacksmith's shop there, a notice for no one to harbor or trust his wife
                        on his account for he should pay no debts of her contracting, which notice
                        the young men tore down the moment he was away.</p>
                     <p>At the falls Ruth took board with Mrs. Hood. It was soon noised abroad that
                        Dr. Binney and his wife had separated again, and Robert Newhall was quickly
                        on the spot. He recommended that some person should wait upon Mrs. Binney
                        and enquire into the cause of her leaving home—to ascertain if it were the
                        intemperance of Dr. Binney, for if so, he ought to be prevented from holding
                        a seat in the legislature.</p>
                     <p>Ruth, not understanding the design, related frankly the circumstances of his
                        inebriation on Saturday evening—when Mr. Newhall declared that, he having
                        already broken his pledge to the people that he would use his endeavors for
                        the suppression of ardent spirits in the Territory, that he ought not to be
                        allowed to vote on the subject! What did he think of his own conduct in
                        remaining in a groggery till Sabbath morning, gambling and drinking, if not
                        to great intoxication, to at least <emph>excess</emph>, and to the injury of
                        a man who would have been glad to have been peacefully and soberly at
                        home?</p>
                     <p>Robert Newhall having been the cause of the trouble thus far, let us see how
                        he conducted himself through it.</p>
                     <p>Ruth, while at Oregon City, having not even a change of apparel, addressed a
                        note to Dr. Binney, of which this is a copy:</p>

                                    you had come to the determination to see whether I would give up
                                    your clothing in a <emph>peaceable</emph> manner or not.</p>
                                 <p>"I have only to say that my character, reputation, honor.
                                    &amp;c, have suffered so much from your scandalous
                                    misrepresentations respecting me, and from the fact that the
                                    whole affair has now become a matter of public notoriety; and
                                    that you left your <emph>house</emph> and <emph>home</emph>
                                    without any just cause; it was your own voluntary act in going
                                    away in the manner you have done—and if you are in a distressed

                                    the affair has gone such a length that I consider it a duty I
                                    owe to myself not to attend to your request, except it be made
                                    through the medium of a third person.</p>
                                 <p>"I am now in town, on my way to Fort Vancouver, and if you feel
                                    so disposed you can send Andrew Hood, Esq., to Moss', where he
                                    will meet me, and through him I will communicate freely on the

                     <p>Ruth Binney felt no desire to "communicate" further on the subject as he had
                        proposed, and seeing no prospect of obtaining clothing, concluded to try to
                        obtain something on Dr. B's credit from the dry goods stores where he had
                        money, and sent to McKinlay's for two calico dresses, and a few cheap
                        articles—but was denied, although Dr. B. had several hundred dollars in the
                        Fort, and was in the practice of taking goods from this place on that
                        consideration. She sent also to Pettygrove's, and was denied—and to Kilbourn
                        &amp; Lawton's, but could obtain nothing—they having heard of the "notice,"
                        put upon the blacksmith's shop. at Champoeg. Ruth attempted to work, and
                        presented a notice of "Millinery and Dress Making by Mrs. Binney," to the
                        editor of the <title>Free Press</title> who would not insert it, for a few
                        weeks, when it was too late to be of service. This was all done from
                           <emph>fear of the man.</emph>

                     <p>Dr. Binney finding his wife silent in relation to his letter, sent Mr.
                        T'Vault to inform her that "if she would confess herself to be in the fault,
                        she might return again to his house." She informed Mr. T'V. that she had
                        nothing to confess, if she had, she would not refuse to do so; and as to her
                        returning to his house, she did not feel particularly in a hurry to do so.
                        Dr. Binney passed on to the fort, and several persons recommended Mrs. B. to
                        improve the opportunity of his absence, and go home and get her clothing. It
                        was now about ten o' clock, and having resolved to go, she walked up the
                        Bluff to Mrs. Holmes', and having communicated to her her plan, which she
                        approved, she assisted her in obtaining a horse and saddle, and at twelve
                        o'clock she was on her way—having twenty-five miles to ride alone, on an
                        unfrequented road. Having a miserable saddle, she stopped at a house and
                        borrowed a small quilt to cover it. On she hurried through sun and dust—up
                        hill and down—fording two rivers, and traversing woods, not daring to
                        consider whether she was afraid of panthers and bears, until she reached the
                        creek within a mile of her house about sunset. The banks to this stream
                        being steep she alighted and drove the horse across, walking herself upon a
                        log—but when upon the other side she could not again catch the animal, which
                        turned about, re-crossed the creek, and returned on the road towards home,
                        dropping the quilt into the midst of the water. Ruth perceived it would be
                        useless to pursue the horse or to get the quilt from the stream as it was
                        then saturated with water, and it being late she thought it best to go
                        directly home.</p>
                     <p>When she reached there Mr. Newbanks was sitting on the piazza, who rose and
                        accosted Mrs. Binney very friendly; shook hands with her, desired her to
                        walk in, and requested his wife to get her some tea. Ruth informed Mr.
                        Newbanks of her errand home, and of the horse escaping from her.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Newbanks told her that Dr. Binney had left all things in his care, with
                        the command to suffer nothing to be taken out of the house.</p>
                     <p>Ruth thinking she was to have trouble from his opposition, told him
                        resolutely that she wanted nothing but her clothing, and <emph>that</emph>
                        she was resolved to have, and 'twould be useless for him to oppose her.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Newbanks had always been greatly Ruth's friend—had been to her house a
                        great many times when in poor health, as had also his Indian wife. He ever
                        manifested grateful and kind feelings towards her; and although he liked to
                        take a glass with Dr. Binney, yet he upheld Mrs. Binney in her course, and
                        told her in reply that he was willing she should have her clothing, and he
                        would assist her in taking it away; he only wanted her to have a witness to
                        the fact of <emph>her</emph> taking them, that Dr. Binney might give him no
                        trouble about them.</p>
                     <p>This being readily agreed to. Mr. Newbanks told his boy to drive up the
                        horses, while Ruth prepared the articles she wished to take with her. All
                        that she cared about were in one chest, this was locked I up and the key
                        could not be found. This chest had been made and given her by her kind
                        brother, when first leaving home—he making it with his own hands to be sure
                        of its goodness. Finding no other way to do she broke it open, where she
                        found what she wanted of clothing, and her papers, and about five hundred
                        dollars in cash. She took her clothes and books, and hesitated about the
                        money, but concluded as she left all the property to which she had a right,
                        the five hundred dollars was a small compensation for what she left, and
                        concluded to take it.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Newbanks and his boy caught two horses for her—one of them being of the
                        increase of the animal she had bought with her salary, due her from the
                        mission at the time of her marriage—and put them into the stable; and in the
                        morning brought them out to the yard, loaned her his pack-saddle to carry
                        her things, and offered to saddle her horses for her. She preferred he
                        should not do this, as it would place him in a position to be blamed by Dr.
                        Binney, and she went with her things to the hospital where was living Mr.
                        and Mrs. Morris, whom Dr. Binney had put upon the place to take care of the
                        cows, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>They secured the two bags of clothing upon the horse as securely as they
                        were able, and Ruth having desired Mr. Newbank's boy to accompany her to the
                        creek to get the quilt from the water, set out to return to the falls. She
                        found great trouble with the pack-horse, in consequence of the insecure
                        manner in which the packs were prepared, and at the creek, with the
                        assistance of the boy, endeavored again to arrange them so that the motion
                        of the animal would not make them liable to loss, but found it
                        impracticable, and at last concluded to call at a Frenchman's, near by, and
                        get him to accompany her.</p>
                     <p>As she was leaving the creek, and the boy was turning to go back, a man on
                        foot, from Champoeg, made his appearance, and saluted her very civilly. Ruth
                        asked how far he was walking, and if he would be so kind as to lead her
                        packhorse to Mr. Obishaw's.</p>
                     <p>He replied that he was going about half way to the falls—to the other side
                        of the two rivers which were in her way.</p>
                     <p>Ruth thought at once it would be a good opportunity to get assistance, and
                        enquired if he were willing to assist her that far.</p>
                     <p>With the utmost readiness he proffered his services.</p>
                     <p>When in view of Mr. Obishaw's house he tried to adjust the packs securely,
                        and Ruth observed he took especial care of that in which was the
                        money—liking to cause it to sound by striking it with his hands, &amp;c. She
                        became suspicious and resolved she would not go with him, and told him that
                        as she perceived she would have much trouble, she had concluded not to go
                        that day, and would stop at Mr. Obishaw's until she could obtain some one to
                        accompany her all the way to the falls.</p>
                     <p>He went on reluctantly, having told her he would render her every assistance
                        possible, and even go all the way with her if she desired it.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Obishaw, with the greatest readiness and kindness, consented to
                        accompany her, and having been detained about an hour for him to get a horse
                        and prepare himself, they set out and soon overtook the man on foot, who had
                        proceeded but about a mile, evidently having been waiting to see if Ruth
                        would follow.</p>
                     <p>When crossing Pudding river, three young men passed them in a race, shouting
                        at the top of their voices, in great glee, and proceeding as if they were in
                        good service and sure of a good reward.</p>
                     <p>By three o'clock Ruth, having called and paid for the lost quilt, reached
                        Mrs. Holmes'. She put the money into Mr. Holmes' hands for safe keeping, and
                        her clothing and papers she entrusted with Mrs. Holmes, and in the morning
                        returned to Oregon City and engaged board with Mrs. Jeffries.</p>
                     <p>At noon she felt impelled, from some unknown but powerful influence, to go
                        at once to Mrs. Holmes and get her money and papers. She could not reason
                        the impression away. 'Twas mid-day in the last of June—the heat was
                        intense—the dust was suffocating, and the road was tedious—yet <emph>go she
                           must,</emph> was an inward impulse which she could not resist. She went,
                        and having obtained the money and papers, returned to Mrs. Jeffries'.</p>
                     <p>She was surprised, on coming in view of the house, to see it surrounded by
                        men—lawyers, private citizens, and the sheriff were outside and in. She
                        passed to the kitchen window and delivered to Mrs. Jeffries her bundle. On
                        going in she was accosted by Dr. Binney, and seeing many she did not know
                        she passed into the kitchen to Mrs. Jeffries and told her she wished to
                        entrust the contents of her bundle to her keeping, and if Dr. Binney should
                        ask for the money to let him have it, but not to give up the papers, for he
                        could have no claims to them as they were strictly her own.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Binney soon signified to Ruth that he wished to speak with her, when he
                        made reference to a <emph>letter</emph> he had received.</p>
                     <p>Ruth requested to see the letter, and was denied. She told him 'twas useless
                        to speak with her on any subject till she had learned the contents of that
                        letter, whatever it might be, and with great reluctance it was at last
                        handed her, the sheriff standing by her side while she read it to prevent
                        her, it appeared, from<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC5702-00000078"/> destroying
                        it, as he thought she might do from the astonishing disclosures which it

                                 </opener>
                                 <p>I have just arrived from M Newmans across Pudding River on my
                                    way home I called at your place and was informed by Mrs Morris
                                    that Mrs Binney arived thare last evening a little before sunset
                                    and remained untill this morning it appears she made herself
                                    altogether at home or rather acted like one from home. My
                                    infrmation is to this effect. Mrs Binney arived entered the
                                    house with an axe, notwithstanding forbedden by M Newbanks,
                                    broke open chests trunks and took of their contents what she
                                    wished also two horres packed them and left this morning I have
                                    taken upon myself to give you this information that you may know
                                    when you arrive at the falls what has ben done that you may
                                    manage accordingly</p>
                                 <p>I have engayed Young Hall to carry the letter.</p>
                                 <p>Mrs Binney it appears did not come alone but accompanyed by one
                                    man who stoped at the creek between your house and Faciers, who
                                    he is we will find out.</p>
                                 <p>Would it not be better for you to say nothing about it untill
                                    you come here and get the pariticulars that you may provide
                                    accordengly After leaveing your house I met Newbanks who had ben
                                    in search of Ms Bs trail and to find out who was with her but
                                    saw nor herd any thing., M Newbanks tells me that he forbid her
                                    taking any thing from the house or entering it,. She said it was
                                    her house, but said M N. you have left it, she observed not for
                                    good, and also told Newbanks that she had taken legal advice and
                                    that it was only taking her own property &amp;c&amp;c.—</p>
                                 <p>I am in hopes you will get this when you arrive at the city it
                                    is my only reason for sending it Mrs B. told Mrs Morris that you
                                    left for the Fort about 10 ollock and she left at 12, so you see
                                    some one was in with her waching you.</p>
                                 <p>I hope you will conclude to come up before you deside on any
                                    course and hear the particulars. it is certainly a high handed
                                    step of the madams.</p>

                     <p>This result had been occasioned by the boy who had gone with Mrs. Binney to
                        the creek, going home and saying a man met her there, and had gone on with
                        her. "Young Hall," was the express man who passed her at Pudding river,
                        shouting—having the letter from Dr. Binney, and which cost him eight dollars
                        for its conveyance to Oregon City, and Mr. Newhall, <emph>was the
                           man,</emph> (?) who after being the cause of this difficulty with Dr.
                        Binney and his wife for political motives; did now turn about, and injure
                        his wife to regain <emph>his</emph> favor.</p>
                     <p>When Mrs. Binney read the letter, and perceived the injustice, as well as
                        want of truth it contained, she was overcome by astonishment, and grief, and
                        could not for some moments suppress her feelings sufficiently to make an
                        explanation of the occurrences connected with her ride home; but in broken
                        sentences and many tears asserted that the letter was entirely false—no
                        person had accompanied her or returned with her but Mr. Obishaw, &amp;c.,
                        &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Her grief at this new form of persecution was most intense and exciting. It
                        aroused the remembrance of the accusations she had endured at the
                        mission—and on no subject was her mind so susceptible of impression as on
                        that which referred to her truth to her husband. The cause of the grief
                        which affected Ruth was misunderstood by Mr. Jeffries, who said afterwards
                        that he could perceive that Mrs. Binney was a "violent tempered woman."</p>
                     <p>But what <emph>is</emph> temper? Is it mere sensitiveness?—or is it a
                        disposition to take revenge when injured? If it be the latter then Ruth
                        Rover has <emph>no</emph> temper—if it be the former, then she has it to a
                        great degree—alas I for her happiness.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Holmes had informed Dr. Binney that Ruth had entrusted clothing, money
                        and papers to his wife's and his care, and if he would go home with him he
                        could have them. Having reached Mr. Holmes' he learned that what he most
                        wished to obtain, viz: money and papers, was <emph>not there!</emph>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the morning he asked Mrs. Jeffries if his wife had entrusted a sum of
                        money to her care, and received it of her. He then asked for the papers, but
                        was answered evasively, and did not obtain them.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Binney, by this time, began to relent towards his wife, having
                        discovered the atrocity of Mr. Newhall's character, and wished her to
                        accompany him home. Not being able to prevail with her, he engaged two
                        friends he had with him, H. Cosgrove and B. Kennedy, to endeavor to
                        encourage her to return. H. Cosgrove made every effort to effect the object
                        Dr. Binney desired, but B. Kennedy recommended him to apply for a bill of
                        divorce, as she would not return to his home. This he perceived he could not
                        so as he could not accuse his wife of a single fault, and he at last
                        returned home without her.</p>
                     <p>This was Ruth's first acquaintance with the above named persons, and we will
                        have to refer to them again as they have both done their share, perhaps, in
                        accomplishing the misfortunes of Dr. Binney. They are both Irishmen and
                        intemperate habits, and possess great influence over the impressible mind,
                        of Ruth's former husband.</p>
                     <p>In ten days Dr. Binney went again for his wife—and informed her that he had
                        become acquainted with the rascality of R. Newhall and some others—told her
                        he could <emph>not live</emph> without she would consent to return—that he
                        was willing to acknowledge the cause of the difficulty was in himself—that
                        he was resolved to use no more spiritous drinks, for he knew it would soon
                        kill him, and as an evidence of his sincerity he told her he had that
                        morning turned half a keg of brandy upon the ground, to save himself from
                        the temptation of drinking it, (another evidence that he would gladly have
                        reformed.) and was ready to settle upon her any amount of his property she
                        might wish for her security in cases of her return. This course was strongly
                        recommended by Mr. and Mrs. Jeffrys, and Ruth seeing repentance in her
                        husband, was ready to forgive him, and receiving the following note from
                        him, she accompanied him home.</p>

                                    myself to do. In the first place I will certainly drink no more
                                    liquor for at least one year, hoping that if I can refrain that
                                    long, I may be able to refrain forever. I acknowledge I have
                                    treated you with undeserved severity, and if ever it should come
                                    to pass that I should put you from home again, I promise to let
                                    you have half my property for your support. This I promise
                                    faithfully to do if you will never give me occasion to ill treat

                                    about your visit here I found was a misrepresentation, and I

                        page 151, he will perceive the change which had been effected in his
                        mind.</p>
                     <p>Peace reigned in the dwelling of Dr. Binney for a few days. Ruth, encouraged
                        and hoping, exerted herself to the utmost to have it enduring, but he was in
                        the midst of the same influences and they again prevailed.</p>
                     <p>We must relate the particulars of another disturbance between this couple,
                        inasmuch as it greatly affected the ultimate decision of the court in
                        relation to the amount of alimony granted Ruth when<pb n="156-157"
                           xml:id="VAC5702-00000079"/> she obtained her bill of divorce. The
                        suspicion which she had long had that Dr. Binney's vicious indulgences when
                        at J. Hord's and other places of dissipation, were not confined to drinking
                        and gambling alone, were one day confirmed by her meeting him with an Indian
                        woman in the bushes near her house. The doctor did not attempt to deny the
                        fact, but told Ruth it was "the d—d liquor that drove him astray." And on
                        her proposing to apply <emph>then</emph> for a bill of divorce, he agreed to
                        give her one-half the money then on hand, viz: $5,000, if she would forgive
                        him and let it pass, and said it was unnecessary for the sum to be taken
                        from the rest as she had the keys of the chest and could take it at any
                        time. <ref rend="super" target="#note_004" xml:id="return_004">*</ref>

                     <p>James Binney, a brother of Dr. Binney, having deserted from the U. S. Navy
                        at California, was shortly after a visiter at Dr. Binney's house. He was
                        excessively addicted to inebriation, and had been since childhood. He soon
                        discovered that there were frequent causes of dissatisfaction existing
                        between his brother and his wife, and that he had a large sum of money on
                        hand, and recommended him to leave her and take his money and go to the
                        mines.</p>
                     <p>This conversation being overheard by Ruth, and perceiving that her husband
                        had determined to deposit his money at Fort Vancouver, get an outfit and
                        leave her alone with the farm for her dependence, resolved to take the part
                        of the sum which he had promised her on her consenting to live with him
                        again after the committal of the error in which she had detected him. She
                        took about four thousand dollars, leaving about six thousand. The result was
                        barbarous treatment, on his part—and the taking up of her abode at the
                        Butte, on her part.</p>
                     <p>The officers of the ship James Binney had deserted pursued him to Oregon,
                        offered a reward of one hundred dollars for his apprehension, and he was
                        obliged to secrete himself to escape punishment. This was well for Dr.
                        Binney, as he sooner recovered his proper feelings, and he then addressed
                        the following letters to his wife.</p>

                                 <p>"DEAR RUTH:—This I now write you may not be received. With the
                                    good intention that compels me to send it but I venture to let
                                    it go, hoping that it will be destroyed as soon as read.</p>
                                 <p>"What has been the matter with me? why! drink is the sole cause
                                    and I know it. Of course I cannot think of ever showing myself
                                    again to you for the purpose of a reconcileation—but I would be
                                    happy in letting you have all your things that are here, and
                                    would be glad to know where to send them, as I purpose to leave
                                    to-morrow to try if I can bring my shattered mind from dropping
                                    into deep melancholy, by the aid of some society more congenial
                                    than is to be found in this detestable place. I feel I want to
                                    get out of this soul destroying place—and I believe were I again
                                    among my kindred and friends at home, that I could enjoy that
                                    happiness in God that I desire. I am most undoubtedly laboring
                                    under partial derangement of mind, and if there is any happiness
                                    for me I pray the Lord will direct me to find it. Strong drink
                                    never will I touch again, and I pray that God will sustain me in
                                    so doing. I am going, if God willing, by the next steamer to the
                                    United States, and I would be willing to leave the greater part
                                    of my effects for you to take care of. The place I will abandon
                                    and leave, for it seems worse than torments to dwell upon it. I
                                    will go and see brother Simeon if the Lord spares me to reach
                                    him.</p>

                                    liquor is concerned I mean, with God's help, never again to
                                    touch it; and I hope my resolution is firm, and that the
                                    Almighty will sustain me in it. I firmly believe what you say
                                    regarding those Champoeg friends, but I firmly purpose that a
                                    dollar of my money will never go that way again. Newell, if he

                                    that Mr. G— was prevented from asking my advice by such a
                                    slander. I believe there were some persons about the house last
                                    night, which caused me to get very little sleep. The things must
                                    be taken from here and deposited in safety. I wish things were
                                    so fixed that I could at once go about settling my business. I
                                    wish you would come up immediately and fix all the things and
                                    take them in your charge to the Butte. You can return again
                                    immediately after doing so. I likewise wish to see you to tell
                                    you of a message that was sent me yesterday, which I think not
                                    prudent to mention in writing. If you come I assure you I will

                        pain of her absence, he one day, in a fury about something, called her a d—d
                        w—e! This was the first outspoken accusation of the kind she had ever heard
                        from him. Many times he had tried to insinuate that he had suspicions of
                        that nature, and many, many times had cursed her in language which none but
                        Satan could frame, and with every base epithet found between A. and Z. of
                        Satan's vocabulary, but never applied this dreadful word to her. Ruth waited
                        till his anger had subsided, and asked his reasons for the accusation. He
                        told her he had none, and wished her to forgive him—that he was in a
                        passion, and she should not mind what he said when he was mad, &amp;c., and,

                     <p>To Mrs. Binney.—April 5, 1850."</p>
                     <p>Dr. Binney had made no further objections to Ruth's keeping the money she
                        had taken, and for a time made active preparations to go home to the States.
                        To ascertain what were Ruth's views on the subject of going again to the
                        United States, we will refer to a letter written her mother about this time.
                        She says—"I perceive my husband remembers you with gratitude, and I wish
                        most certainly he could be prevailed on to go and live in the vicinity of
                        his and my relatives, and try to enjoy a little of life ere life is all
                        gone. His practice at present is profitable, and yields ready pay; hence he
                        says when I have a little more and a little more, then I will go and live
                        among my friends. Let me, he says, but get enough to buy me a neat cottage
                        and to furnish it, a carriage, a horse, and have some money left to live on,
                        then I'll leave Oregon.</p>
                     <p>At other times he is so impatient to be<pb n="158-159"
                           xml:id="VAC5702-00000080"/> away he can hardly wait to close his
                        business. His health is, I think, less good than formerly, and my own is
                        poor; indeed, I am a constant sufferer; and but for some unseen power that
                        upholds me I know not from whence comes the powers of endurance. I would I
                        could be employed more to my wish, but as it is I can only hope, and wait,
                        and trust, which, in itself, yields rich delight and renders delay
                        supportable. Of this, however, I am assured; if Dr. Binney does not soon
                        decide to leave this country, I shall leave without him, for this reason: my
                        life is utterly wasting. I am by no means engaged as I expected to be when I
                        came to Oregon. I cannot live my time over again, and hence what I would do
                        must be done quickly or not at all. And can I waste all my time on trifles
                        for trifles sake? or shall I rather from respect to the recompense of
                        reward—burst all these shackles and <emph>do</emph> what I have to do ere
                        time with me is no more? I wait to be instructed and led by the unerring
                        spirit of Truth ere I take any decisive steps. Only of this one thing I am
                        certain; that little more of my time is to be suffered to go as much, too
                        much has already gone without my making an effort, a determined effort to be
                        what I wish to be. Live longer, my dear mother, if Providence will permit;
                        and I do most earnestly hope I may be permitted to see you again and
                        administer, in some way, consolation to your last moments."</p>
                     <p>Dr. Binney's mind being ever vacillating between temptation and seductive
                        influences on one hand, and a secret prompting to break away from them all
                        and be good, respected and happy, he was very tardy in closing his business;
                        and Ruth, would he have reformed, would have been content to have lived in
                        Oregon with him; and she tried another plan a which was to have him live at
                        a further distance from Champoeg, hoping thus the inducements to lead him
                        astray would be lessened.</p>
                     <p>With this object in view she encouraged him to hire a house on the French <choice>
                           <sic>praire</sic>
                           <corr>prairie</corr>
                        </choice>, about ten or twelve miles from Champoeg, and move to it. He did
                        so, but it was of little use. He could easily ride to his favorite haunts,
                        and moreover, similar houses to J. Hord's were found in every direction.</p>
                     <p>In a few weeks they returned home again, and here his abuse of his wife
                        became so intolerable, and his conduct so entirely beyond what it was proper
                        for any one to bear, that Ruth came to the resolution that she would leave
                        him, and if she could not get home to her friends, she could at least, she
                        thought, maintain herself by her own industry.</p>
                     <p>Having thus determined, she prepared the following note for her husband, and
                        went away to the Butte:</p>

                                 <p>"DR. BINNEY: The last moment of my time is expended which I can
                                    give to you till I do something to increase my own happiness and
                                    renew my strength.</p>
                                 <p>"The sufferings which I have endured, for the last nine months
                                    particularly, in body and mind, are evidently undermining my
                                    health and rendering my mind totally unfit for cares which must
                                    necessarily be upon it.</p>
                                 <p>"I can do no more for you—I can bear no more from you, and
                                    suffer all the deprivations which have been my lot ever since I
                                    became your wife.</p>
                                 <p>"Since my return from the Butte I have tried every possible way
                                    to please, serve, and live in peace with you, but all in vain.
                                    You have broken every promise you made to induce me to
                                    return—have every day for a month poured every kind of abuse
                                    upon me at every interview—have refused to do anything for your
                                    own or my good—and have bade me leave the place to yourself, for
                                    I was you have said, hanging about it with the intention of
                                    robbing it and filching your property—all of which I cannot bear
                                    in addition to what I have already borne and suffered from you.
                                    I therefore utterly refuse to live any longer alone with you in
                                    Oregon.</p>
                                 <p>"I will never again recommend you to go to the United States or
                                    elsewhere to gratify me, or for your own benefit, for every time
                                    I have done so you have poured abuses and curses upon me, and
                                    sworn I was trying in every possible way to urge you to ruin. I
                                    therefore leave you to yourself to act as you shall choose, and
                                    the consequences, if evil, must rest only upon your own
                                    head.</p>
                                 <p>"You said some time since you were sensible of the evil which
                                    intemperance was doing you, and were resolved to drink no more,
                                    but have again returned steadily to the practice, which has
                                    blasted the last ray of hope I indulged of your being yet
                                    prosperous and happy, or of myself living with any kind of
                                    harmony with you.</p>
                                 <p>"'Tis all in vain for me to entirely destroy myself for your
                                    good, which yet will do you no good—for you will accept of no
                                    advice nor be benefitted by any thing I can do for you.</p>
                                 <p>"I therefore leave you, resolved to live with you, alone, no
                                    more till I shall be satisfied you are a reformed man.</p>
                                 <p>"Besides the above I am aware that you are nearly every

                                    abuses and curses of such a profligate man as yourself, and at
                                    the same time perform every drudgery for him, I am certain that

                     <p>At the Butte Ruth hired a room, taught school for her board, and did some
                        sewing as she had opportunity.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Binney soon found himself wishing her good services about the place, and
                        again endeavored to induce her to return. But this she would not consent to
                        do. He then told her he was determined to leave Oregon as soon as possible,
                        and wished her to permit him to board with her at the Butte, while he
                        arranged matters to leave. She consented, and lent him every possible
                        assistance in her power to get ready.</p>
                     <p>Two or three weeks went pleasantly by, during which time he had persuaded
                        her to put the money in her possession into his chest with the balance, for
                        he said they were pow going home, and the money having been earned by them
                        both he wished that both should enjoy the use of it, and it was more secure
                        together, &amp;c. Ruth, ever confiding when he seemed to be doing right,
                        placed the money in his chest according to his request.</p>
                     <p>Presently some business took him to Oregon City, where he met some persons
                        who were great friends to him while he had a heavy and well filled purse.
                        They enticed him to drink and to the usual accompaniments, gambling,
                        &amp;c., and after a full indulgence and a heavy expense he returned to his
                        wife. His conduct towards her was then entirely changed. The usual curses
                        and accusations followed, and finally he privately ordered a Frenchman to
                        come with his cart to the door, when he lashed and bound his chest
                        containing the money, put it into the cart and went away, leaving his wife
                        without one dime to help herself.</p>
                     <p>One would think that this had been sufficient to have blasted the last
                        glimmerings of interest which Ruth Rover could have felt for her husband,
                        but she forgave again—knowing that he was in an error and believing that he
                        could yet be saved.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Binney attempted to leave the country alone, taking his property with
                        him, but he learned that there were persons about who were watching him and
                        intending to prevent him from going till he had provided for his wife's
                        maintenance.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Binney at this time had in cash about sixteen thousand dollars,
                        including the five thousand dollars he had of his wife's. Those persons who
                        were knowing to the hard services she had performed for her husband, both on
                        the farm and for sick persons, of whom there had been many boarding at his
                        house, were outraged at this act of his, and affirmed, some that she should
                        have no less than one-half of the money then in his hands, others that
                        two-thirds was fully her due for, they said, they had known Dr. Binney for
                        years, and that he had nothing when he married and never would have had
                        anything but for his wife, and that, if she left him he soon would be a poor
                        man again; and some who made these remarks were his most intimate friends.
                        Nevertheless, he kept the money and soon again proposed to Ruth to accompany
                        him home to the States.</p>
                     <pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC5702-00000081"/>
                     <p>The farm as yet was not sold, and, according to the law of the land. Ruth
                        had an undoubted right to one-half of this, viz: three hundred and twenty
                        acres. She wished Dr. Binney to leave it in some person's care till it could
                        be sold at a proper price. He was opposed to this, and affirmed he would
                        sell it if he got but ten cents for it. It was advertised and sold at
                        auction for twelve hundred and seventy-five dollars, although Dr. Binney had
                        been offered three thousand for it but a few months previously. There being
                        but one person to bid besides one he had employed as an out-bidder, Dr.
                        Binney's recklessness was the cause of this loss.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Binney and his wife at last were in readiness to leave for home, and
                        there we will accompany them.</p>

                        wife and daughter, was travelling to the mines, and were passengers with
                        Ruth and her husband from Oregon.</p>

                     <p>Next morning returning to the boat he related to his wife what he had seen
                        and heard the evening before in the far-famed city of San Francisco—famed
                        for its wealth and vices. Said he:</p>
                     <p>"I declare, it beats everything I ever heard of or saw. There was one place
                        I went into where there was a woman sitting at a table—and a well-dressed
                        thing she was, too! (Don't be jealous, old woman.) Well, by gosh! if she
                        wasn't sitting there with more money before her, I believe, than our two
                        mules could haul! I declare, I never saw so much in my life!</p>
                     <p>"Well, she was sitting there, and the room full of men; and there was a kind
                        of a thing with a ball which went around—O, I can't tell you how. I declare,
                        'twould take me all day to tell all about it. Some men would bet two and
                        three hundred dollars on the way that are ball went! By gosh! I wanted to
                        overhaul them—them are fellers. I never saw the like in my life!</p>
                     <p>"And besides this," said he, "I came plaguey nigh getting into a scrape,
                        too, myself. There was that are <emph>Long</emph> there, and I'll be hanged

                        I did. I told them 'twould never do to cheat a man that way where I was.
                        Yes! I told them that I was a <emph>dimocrat</emph>, and I would have none

                     <p>"Come, old woman, I've a notion to send you on in the launch to Benicia, and

                        comfortable with new mattresses, new blankets, and white Marsailles quilts,
                        and the luxury of an arm chair. The steward—the second person whom I saw on
                        board—was a mulatto, tall, graceful, with a highly intellectual head;
                        dressed in black pants and white, yes, <emph>white</emph> shirt, and a red
                        silk sash around his waist—not a <emph>new</emph> one just for that
                        occasion—but one that had been worn and well used. I felt immediate respect
                        for him, and have never had occasion to feel otherwise. Nothing can exceed
                        the politeness and kindness with which he treats the captain and passengers,
                        his excellent cooking, or the order and quiet with which he performs his
                        task. For several days I have been quite ill with dysentery, and this kind
                        steward will often force my mind to revert to the time when I tried so hard
                        in '37 to induce the steward of the Peru to forsake the ways of sin and
                        follow those of righteousness, and to the promise that if we cast our bread
                        upon the waters we shall find it after many days; and if this be its
                        fulfilment in my case 'tis <emph>many</emph> days indeed, but the
                           <emph>bread</emph> of kindness needed and acceptable."</p>
                     <p>The tediousness of a sea voyage is often rendered less irksome by a sight of
                        the varieties of fish and birds inhabiting the waters and floating in the
                        sky above. The contemplation of these is very interesting and profitable. As
                        our travellers approached Panama, being, however, nine hundred miles from
                        land, they were surprised at the appearance of a butterfly on board. How it
                        had lived to be carried thus far at sea, is very surprising. Of it Ruth
                        says— <q>

                     </p>
                     <p>In the packet in which Dr. Binney and his wife went to Panama there were
                        about eighteen gentlemen in the upper cabin, and probably one hundred in the
                        second cabin below. Their pastime during a voyage of eight weeks had been
                        mostly gambling and games of chance. At length they took to discussion, and
                        Ruth being obliged to hear all that was said, for there was no retreat, says
                        of their debates:</p>
                     <p>"There is a great disposition among the passengers to contend and dispute,
                        while almost every subject within creation's bound has been agitated, but
                        with little good, however, other than to betray the weakness of the
                        agitator. I was indignant yesterday to hear the 'weakness of woman's
                        intellect' named as a subject for discussion. Nothing was proved, of course,
                        by our lords, but that woman is dependant on man, and, as one said, that
                        'she can make herself happy by pleasing him.' But I had my own thoughts,
                        which were: Should she be educated to the same extent as men, and have the
                        same call for the exercise of her talents<pb n="162-163"
                           xml:id="VAC5702-00000082"/> I am persuaded this stigma of her weakness
                        would be removed. Instances have been known when she has been found capable
                        of the same intellectual training as man, and she has thus shone with equal
                        splendor—except that her light has resembled the modest light of the moon,
                        while <emph>his</emph>, who can go out upon creation's face unabashed, has
                        resembled the more dazzling rays of the sun. And instances have <choice>
                           <sic>occured</sic>
                           <corr>occurred</corr>
                        </choice> (the Lord forbid they should be many) when woman has conducted
                        public business—has met the bluffs and rebutts of the world—been familiar
                        with scenes of vice—and has, in all, proven that her mind is not
                           <emph>weak</emph>, but as capable of endurance and perseverance, and I
                        believe <emph>more</emph> capable of passing the ordeal, and maintaining its
                        own strength and purity, than man's.</p>
                     <p>"I often ponder on the probable results if women instead of men had gone to
                        the mines of California, with characters for morality and religion as good
                        as men have borne. Would the result have been as great a sinking into vice
                        as it has been with men? I am constrained to reply to myself that in nearly
                        every instance they would have returned unscathed, and exalted and
                        strengthened in virtue.</p>
                     <p>"I long my sex should be emancipated from the <choice>
                           <sic>thraldom</sic>
                           <corr>thralldom</corr>
                        </choice> of erroneous public opinion—her worth appear in its true light—her
                        injuries be redressed, and herself occupy that position in society which she
                        is capable of adorning. I wish not to see her a mere bauble—a doll—to dress
                        fine and lay by in a drawer—suitable to be seen and used only as a
                        pastime—but disrobed of the imputation of weakness and unchastity, and
                        adorned with the confidence and estimation of the opposite sex, which she
                        deserves.</p>
                     <p>"Were all these passengers women instead of men, would they pass day and
                        night in dissipation and contention? Verily, I believe not. Work and books
                        would at least engage their attention."</p>
                     <p>"Last Sabbath a young gentleman brought me to read the 'Christian Keepsake
                        for 1849,' and as I studied the illustrations my spirit melted within me. My
                        heart had been ready to burst with sorrow for nearly the whole voyage, and
                        in contemplating the representations of Faith and Hope it found language to
                        vent itself.</p>
                     <p>"I was also affected by the kindness of the young man who was willing to
                        impart of the good he himself possessed for the pleasure of another.</p>
                     <p>"And I have been often taken by surprise, during the voyage, when I have
                        thoughtlessly expressed a wish, by the captain immediately gratifying me if
                        it was in his power to do so. I have been so long accustomed to have my
                        wishes disregarded, that I would not have spoken if I had supposed he would
                        trouble himself to gratify me.</p>
                     <p>"'Tis now the twenty-fifth of December, and our passage seems a tedious one.
                        Light winds, squalls, head winds, and calms constantly assail us; and our
                        good sailors, I should think, tan but seldom have on dry clothing. I
                        observed yesterday the man at the wheel standing in a rain for two hours,
                        looked entirely chilled, while his hands and face appeared, as we say,
                        par-boiled. He was bare footed, and from every part of his clothing the
                        water was dripping. But this is but a small part of their labors: the worse
                        the weather, the greater their trials and exposures.</p>
                     <p>"Our kind captain, who moves about the ship respected by every one, giving
                        his orders calmly, without cursing or noise, referred feelingly to his home
                        today. He said it being Christmas Eve he knew exactly what his wife and
                        children were doing. I wonder that any sea captain will go to sea without
                        his wife, and that any woman will suffer her husband to go to sea without
                        her—for where there is mutual love existing, as there must be in this case,
                        what a great satisfaction it must be to each party to be with the other, and

                        rapidly failing, and can stand but a few moments without fainting fits
                        attacking me. Death is not appalling, and the "River" once passed, I
                        contemplate with delight the employments of eternity. Free from suffering,
                        and enraptured in adoration of God, the future life is very desirable, and I
                        can never tell how much I wish my work here was <emph>finished</emph> and I
                        entered upon it.</p>
                     <p>"Dolphin every day by some of the passengers. The captain always requests a
                        piece for me, even when it all belongs to the men below. A brother's
                        kindness could not exceed this!"</p>
                     <p>After a tedious passage the California packet at last anchored at Taboga, an
                        island in the bay of Panama. This place we would like to describe, but have
                        not space.</p>
                     <p>During this passage Ruth had been very ill, yet had received not much
                        attention or kindness from her husband. The passengers were mostly
                           <emph>gentlemen</emph>, and were very kind and pleasant to her, and no
                        one could exceed Captain Hunt in his considerations of her disagreeable
                        situation, or the steward in rendering her every possible service and
                        attention.</p>
                     <p>Arrived at Taboga they were obliged to cross the bay in a small boat, rowed
                        by men, in which Ruth was for about eight hours exposed to the intense heat
                        of the sun; and found herself, when at Panama, in addition to her former
                        illness, suffering from a high fever.</p>
                     <p>Captain Hunt had kindly engaged for Dr. Binney and his wife rooms at the
                        American Hotel, where she was glad to rest after such exposure and
                        weariness, but dreadful were the sufferings of that night she passed there.
                        Dr. Binney was soon intoxicated and paid his wife no attention at all. One
                        of the passengers sent into her room, when she arrived, a glass of lemonade,
                        which was the first refreshment she had taken for the day. The hotel was
                        dreadfully filthy; emmets were running about the beds, and mice over the
                        floors; the house was thronged with men indulging in every dissipation no
                        air could be let into the room because of the people about before the door
                        and window. There was no respectable female in the house, and no one to
                        render her a service only as she could call servant.</p>
                     <p>Late in the evening Dr. Binney was assisted to his room in a state of
                        perfect inebriation, and Ruth had to pass the night in watchfulness and
                        suffering alone, hearing what she could not avoid hearing in all the rooms
                        above and around her.</p>
                     <p>The passengers of the Packet had, all but five, gone to the other side of
                        the Isthmus. These were to leave next day, and they were all the persons in
                        the place with whom Dr. Binney and his wife were acquainted, and with whom
                        she thought it would be prudent to trust themselves and their money in
                        passing so dangerous a place. Seeing the course her husband was going to
                        take in the dissipated town of Panama, Ruth wished much to prevail on him to
                        accompany these five gentlemen that day to Cruces, and in the morning, long
                        before light, she rose, while he was yet sleeping, and prepared every
                        article for leaving, that there might be no delay nor excuse, for the reason
                        they were not ready.</p>
                     <p>But he refused to go, and 'twas in vain she urged that they might not have
                        an opportunity of travelling with friends for a great time to come—or of the
                        expense of remaining there—or of her ill health, which made her wish to
                        reach home and be with her friends—he only became enraged and rewarded her
                        with curses. She then tried to <choice>

                        having called at the door to enquire if they were going in their company,
                        she asked him to bring horses for them, for she thought she could prevail on
                        Dr. Binney to go, and if not, she would go without him.</p>
                     <p>But this was of no use: he forbid the man to bring animals there, and cursed
                        his wife before them all; calling her vile names, and swearing she had made
                        an agreement with one of the men to murder him on the route, and rob him,
                        and marry the man when she reached home.</p>
                     <p>Ruth had to submit, but she resolved she would stay no longer in the hotel,
                        after being so much abused by her husband before the boarders; and in
                        consequence of finding herself suffering for want of better accommodations,

                        resolved to walk out and endeavor to find them.</p>
                     <p>She could scarcely travel from illness. Nevertheless, she found trees, and
                        shade, and air, and for some time rested herself outside the walls. Walking
                        on as she was able, enquiring for Americana, she found none, but at last met
                        a young man who said he was from Philadelphia, who told her there were no
                        English or American families in the place, only some traders—and perceiving
                        she was very ill recommended her to go into an American's store and rest,
                        and he would endeavor to find a room for her where she could receive
                        attention.</p>
                     <p>The store-keeper recommended her to a new house where resided a Frenchman
                        and his wife, and to this she went and was soon comfortably reposing in a
                        pleasant and airy chamber. She applied to an American physician who informed
                        her she had the prevailing fever, and had better go to the house of his
                        partner where she could have an English nurse and every attention
                        required.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Binney, immediately on her leaving the hotel, had her clothing sent
                        across the bay to the Packet, and himself engaged a passage in her to go to
                        Valparaiso. Captain Hunt informing the American Consul of her situation in
                        thus being left destitute and sick, it was insisted that Dr. Binney should
                        provide for her wants before leaving the harbor. He would not resign to her
                        the five thousand dollars and half the price of the land claim, which she
                        thought was strictly her own, but consented to let her have two thousand
                        dollars on her arrival at New York, and which he told her he would never try
                        to get from her.</p>
                     <p>Ruth's illness increasing rather than decreasing, her physician informed her
                        that to save her life she must, if possible, endeavor to reach a colder
                        climate. Dr. Binney had ere this again regained the proper state of his
                        mind, and was also anxious to go home.</p>
                     <p>In Ruth's description of Panama, Gorgona, Cruces, and intervening places,
                        appears some interesting information which we wo'd like to quote, but cannot
                        do so here.</p>
                     <p>Her physician had recommended, in consequence of the great prostration of
                        her strength, that she be carried over the Isthmus in a hammock, by natives;
                        but she feared the unpleasantness of being put upon the ground every time
                        they wished to rest, and was also aware that such a plan would cause great
                        fatigue to those employed, she therefore determined to try to ride upon a
                        mule, as no carriages could be obtained and horses were not considered as
                        safe as mules.</p>
                     <p>She found great difficulty in maintaining her seat upon the saddle, fancying
                        each time she nearly fell on either side, through weakness, that the girth
                        was loose, and had it tightened till the poor animal could scarcely
                        walk.</p>
                     <p>Of the road she says:</p>
                     <p>"The sun was high enough to cause considerable heat, which was modified by
                        the shrubbery on either side, and by our frequently descending into low
                        passes between the mountains where was generally a stream of water.</p>
                     <p>"Sometimes we came to a few acres of plain land where would be seen large
                        herds of cattle grazing.</p>
                     <p>"The road was of every possible variety which can be imagined: up hill and
                        down hill—rough and smooth—through gulches and over precipices—through water
                        and over parched earth—broad and narrow—level and uneven—around and
                        across—shady and exposed to the scorching sun—slippery and firm—lonesome and
                        congregated—beautiful and frightful—tame and wild—rocky and clayey—wooded
                        and barren—crooked and straight—colored and colorless—flowered and
                        unadorned—through and over—under and above—by and with alternately every
                        possible hue depicted on the verdure and soil. Frequently we came to passes
                        just wide enough for a mule and his pack to get along, with the banks some
                        feet above them, and in these there could be no turning, hence, as some
                        persons might enter at the other end, which was generally some rods off, the
                        guide would halloa when he came to them, and if there came no answer he
                        would enter and keep up the same noise till he was out again.</p>
                     <p>"The road was very much worn as could be seen, particularly on ascending and
                        descending a hill, in the deep steps which had been made by the feet of the
                        animals, and from which they would slide to the next in descending and leap
                        to the one in advance in ascending, and which movement many times nearly
                        placed me under their feet in front, or at their heels after them. In either
                        case I should have rolled into a stream below.</p>
                     <p>"Mules are the best for travelling these dreadful places—indeed, I believe
                        no <emph>horse could</emph> travel this road without accident—but the former
                        are so accustomed to it that they seem to know every step they should take,
                        and the exact course which is best, and 'tis in vain you may try to rein him
                        where you fancy he will do better: you may pull the bridge as though you
                        would raise an oak—his head is unmovable, and you find him just as
                        "obstinate as a mule." He will go where he pleases, and you can't prevent
                        him.</p>
                     <p>"Many a hard word did the one in advance of me receive for this same reason,
                        but at the last the rider acknowledged he was an excellent beast and had
                        taken him through safely, which was beyond his expectations."</p>
                     <p>'Tis unnecessary and unpleasant to relate, particularly, the course pursued
                        by Dr. Binney during this visit to the States. Some particulars must be
                        shown in the petition afterwards presented by Ruth to the court praying for
                        a bill of divorce, and we will only hastily refer to his general course.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Binney could not have lived probably two days longer at sea when she
                        reached New York, yet she found the severe cold of the season, it being the
                        month of February, immediately effective in restoring her to health.</p>
                     <p>She tarried with her husband's friends till she was able to travel, and then
                        proceeded to Massachusetts. Her husband accompanied her, but returned again
                        to New York next day, being anxious, as he said, to go to the mint in
                        Philadelphia to get his gold dust coined, and had promised to meet her again
                        in Massachusetts, in three weeks.</p>
                     <p>
                        <emph>Seven</emph> weeks passed, and she had not heard from him. She feeling
                        very uncomfortable at his long absence and silence, in view of the
                        astonishment of her friends. At length he wrote her, giving as the reason of
                        his silence that he had been ill of <hi rend="i"/>influenza, and was
                        intending to visit her in a few days; adding that he entertained for her the
                        same affection as ever. This relieved Ruth's mind considerably, but two
                        weeks more elapsed without seeing him, and she supposing him again ill, went
                        to New York and found him not ill but robust and hearty, and apparently
                        enjoying himself fully. She perceived by his appearance and the remarks of
                        his friends that he was pursuing a round of dissipation and pleasure not at
                        all calculated to encourage him in a moral and upright course, or to destroy
                        that tendency to evil which had beset him through life, and so many times
                        occasioned to him great suffering if not actual danger.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto Ruth had indulged confidence in his friends, that they would try to
                        exert an influence over him which would have a tendency different from this,
                        but she now perceived that New York was not the place to reform him, nor his
                        friends the persons to encourage it.</p>
                     <p>A son and brother who was <emph>rich</emph> and able to pay all expenses to
                        balls, theatres, parties of pleasure, &amp;c., was too great a desideratum
                        for the extravagant and far-fetched gaiety of the Binney's, and what did
                           <emph>they</emph> care about his wife or her rights, so long as
                           <emph>they</emph> were benefitted by this godsend of money.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Binney was exactly suited with the encouragement given by them, and as
                        it would take some time to run through sixteen thousand dollars, he felt no
                        fears for the future, and was bent only on the full enjoyment of the
                        present.</p>
                     <p>Besides this evil influence on the part of his mother and sisters, he was
                        constantly enticed into vice and extravagance by a younger brother, then
                        about twenty-eight years of age. He had been born since his father's failure
                        and death,<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC5702-00000084"/> and being the pet he
                        was a great favorite in the family.</p>
                     <p>The sisters, seven in number, had, after they became reduced, given their
                        attention to dress making, and by this means had raised and educated Thomas,
                        which should certainly redound much to their praise. By his education he was
                        qualified to act as clerk, but he had never, in consequence of his
                        disposition for gaiety, been able to be otherwise than dependant on them for
                        assistance in obtaining a livelihood, and it was a most lucky occurrence
                        that a brother of such generous disposition, and love for the tinsel of
                        life, had come among them with such abundant means to "show out."</p>
                     <p>Dr. Binney related to him the troubles he had passed with his wife, and
                        found the readiest sympathy, which operated like a charm in unloosing his
                        purse-strings for every want of such a considerate and feeling brother.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Binney was for a time enraptured with the winning society of "Tom," and
                        all the warnings Ruth could suggest were not sufficient to open his eyes to
                        the real intents of the family towards him.</p>
                     <p>He however consented to accompany Ruth home, where he for some time visited
                        among her friends, but at last said he did not like to be living on others,
                        and wished to go again to New York.</p>
                     <p>She then, the better to please him, and always fearing he would become
                        dissatisfied and return to Oregon, hired rooms and commenced housekeeping
                        till he should have determined on some place to settle which would please
                        him. But this was not effectual—he was away again to New York. Shortly after
                        he offended his mother by leading Thomas, as she said, into intoxication,
                        and he came to Ruth again in Massachusetts.</p>
                     <p>When Ruth, to entice him still more to remain in the States, engaged the
                        half of her mother's house, including the garden and orchard, at her own
                        expense, and commenced house keeping there; but this did not suit him. He
                        would not, he said, be dependent on any of her friends, while he had money
                        enough to help himself. She then took rooms entirely <emph>away</emph> among
                        strangers, in Salem, Mass., where he for a <choice>
                           <sic>faw</sic>
                           <corr>few</corr>
                        </choice> days remained with her, she bearing every expense for their
                        living, except that occasionally he would purchase some trifling article,
                        such as a lobster, to regale his own appetite.</p>
                     <p>He had many times said to her that he meant to have the two thousand dollars
                        back again, which he had given her at Panama; and which he told her his
                        mother and sisters had said was a most unheard of occurrence for a woman to
                        be permitted to hold that amount of money <choice>
                           <sic>independantly</sic>
                           <corr>independently</corr>
                        </choice> of her husband.</p>
                     <p>As he could not obtain it of her, he seemed resolved that he would obtain
                        all he could of it in the way of making her bear her own expenses, and his
                        too if possible. But Ruth did not regard the money;—her husband had a deeper
                        hold upon her affections than mines of gold could have had, and she was
                        intent only on saving him. From there Dr. Binney went to the mint for his
                        coin, and returned with it to Salem.</p>
                     <p>The gold dust he took home amounted when coined to nearly nine thousand
                        dollars—and this he had with him. He had selected the largest pieces, when
                        in New York, and distributed them in the shape of rings, buttons and
                        keepsakes to every member of his family—and Ruth, who had contributed so
                        largely towards obtaining it, and preserving it, was not remembered in this
                        distribution—she received not the smallest particle from her husband by way
                        of reward, nor as a remembrance, and had not a specimen only the four
                        particles picked from the table in Oregon, to show to her friends in
                        Massachusetts, who had never seen "gold dust."</p>
                     <p>Small acts generally speak a plainer language than great deeds; and Ruth
                        understood this act of her husband to be an evidence either that he was
                        totally ungrateful for all the services she had rendered him; or that he was
                        entirely overruled by his friends. Both these ideas were supported by
                        circumstances—for he must have been <emph>ungrateful</emph> to have cast her
                        so many times out upon the world without the means to help herself; and many
                        occurrences had convinced her that his friends preferred that all the funds
                        should be in <emph>his</emph> hands, rather than that she should be
                        possessed of any of them.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Binney in two days after his return from the mint, found it very
                        desirable to get angry enough, though without any known cause, to take his
                        money and go to New York. He took up his abode in a hotel in the first
                        place, being too angry with his mother to go to her house; but she learned
                        through "Tom" that he was in the city with his money, and all feuds were at
                        once forgiven, and he was urged to return to them. He told them that the
                        reason of his returning to the city was trouble again with his wife, and he
                        intended to leave her, and return at once to Oregon. He was pitied, and
                        condoled, and encouraged in the plan he had suggested, and moreover informed
                        that as she had two thousand dollars which she would not give up—it was
                        enough to support her—and if she should happen to come short she could work
                        like themselves, and 'twould hurt her no worse—and besides this, if he would
                        take "Tom" with him, he could assist him, and be company for him, and they
                        two could do a handsome business of some kind, especially if the "watchful
                        and saving Ruth" were not along. This plan seemed advisable to Dr. Binney,
                        who acquiesced in it immediately; and thought as "Tom" was a good clerk he
                        could tend store—and himself having at this time about eleven thousand
                        dollars remaining, he could take out a quantity of goods which would sell
                        well in Oregon, and in a few years they both would be rich, and then
                        farewell to want or care! Meantime Ruth knew nothing of the whereabouts of
                        her husband; but ventured to write to New York enquiring for him. She had
                        become satisfied that he would go into no business in the States, and his
                        money was being rapidly expended, and the influence of friends which she had
                        hoped would be <emph>good</emph> over him, she found was even worse than
                        that to which he had been subjected in Oregon; and she now felt that she
                        cared not where they might live, if he would only settle himself in a home
                        of his own—be industrious, and suffer her to live with him in peace and
                        happiness.</p>
                     <p>With these feelings she wrote him thus:</p>

                                 <p>"MY DEAR WIFE,—I am still happy to hear from you, and I
                                    certainly feel pleased that you are now willing to accompany me
                                    wherever I wish to go. That place is Oregon—but as to your wish
                                    of me going alone, that is now out of the question, as I have
                                    entered into partnership with Thomas for five years, and have at
                                    this time a quantity of goods shipped and still purchasing,
                                    which will prevent me from going to Salem to see you, for the
                                    vessel sails in the course of ten or twelve days. Thomas is a
                                    pretty good business man, and I am in hopes we will do well. It
                                    is impossible to state to you clearly by letter our projects,
                                    prospects, &amp;c, but if you should feel interested enough in
                                    our affairs to come to New York, of which I would feel happy,
                                    then we will be able to understand each other, as it is and
                                    always has been my wish to live and die with my wife. If you
                                    come you had better come as quick as possible, in case you
                                    should want to get anything ready to ship, for you see the
                                    vessel sails in a few days. Give my respects to all, and believe

                     <p>Having learned that Thomas Binney was very much given to intemperance, she
                        felt great fears that her husband, in case of his returning to Oregon, would
                        take him with him, and knowing that in this case they must bear every
                        expense, and that he was very extravagant, and remembering what she had
                        suffered in her domestic relations by having James Binney come into her
                        family in Oregon, she felt a great aversion to his accompanying them.</p>
                     <p>Had Thomas Binney been a moral young man, and not liable to lead her husband
                        astray, Ruth would have done anything in her power to assist him in rising
                        in the world; but she had seen enough of his impertinence already to
                        convince her that she could have no good influence over him. Hence her wish
                        that her husband should, "go alone."</p>
                     <p>She thus answered Doctor Binney's letter:</p>

                                 <p>"MY DEAR HUSBAND: I have just with much pleasure received your
                                    letter, and though very happy to hear from you, regret
                                    exceedingly the precipitancy with which you have lately
                                    proceeded.</p>
                                 <p>"I am satisfied you have acted unwisely from what I have known
                                    in times past, and from what I every day discover of people's
                                    disposition to commit error, and of the indications of
                                    Providence to deter us from what is wrong.</p>
                                 <p>"What text do you think accidentally met my eye the day you left
                                    here? It was this: <q>
                                       <p>"And these two kings shall set their heads together to do
                                          mischief; and they shall tell lies over one table;
                                             <emph>but they shall not prosper.</emph>'</p>
                                    </q> "By which I then gained an intimation of what you have
                                    since done.</p>
                                 <p>"And this morning when praying most earnestly for God to
                                    preserve you and keep you from every evil, I also accidentally
                                    met these texts in scripture: <q>
                                       <p>"'And I will scatter him, and the wealth I have given him,
                                          to the four winds; and because he would not have Me to
                                          reign over him he shall wander destitute and forlorn, and
                                          famine and want shall be his portion.'</p>
                                    </q>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>"You say 'Tom' is something of a business man. He may be. But
                                    what is his intention in encouraging you to do as I you have
                                    done? It is this, and nothing else, viz: to build himself up at
                                    your expense! And what is the object of those who are backing
                                    him? <emph>This.</emph> To get your money in a road which will
                                    bring it to them! This is evident from eight years' observation.
                                    And where would your money go in case of your death in Oregon?
                                    You can readily perceive. And what is the prospect before me
                                    should I go with you? <emph>This.</emph> Slavery to an enemy,
                                    viz: Thomas Binney, and destitution should you die.</p>
                                 <p>"You will readily remember that I, some years ago, discovered
                                    the disposition of your relatives towards me, and I since my
                                    return this time that feeling has been fully carried out. Notice
                                    the concealing of the gold you gave them that I might not know
                                    its value. They knew they had no right to it without my
                                    knowledge, hence their caution.</p>
                                 <p>"No, my husband, you know how arduously I have labored to help
                                    earn and save the property God has been pleased to bless us with
                                    since our marriage; and when you enter into schemes to expend
                                    that property on others and leave me you will never prosper or
                                    be happy. I can never approve of your partnership with Thomas,
                                    nor consent to his enriching himself at your and my expense.</p>
                                 <p>"Remember this: If you thus do without my consent and
                                    approbation, you do wrong, and certain calamity will befall you!
                                    Think of Mr. Leslie's remark to us when he married us: '<hi
                                       rend="i"/>Neither one can ever act, in matters of any
                                    importance, independently opposition to the wishes of the other,
                                    without incurring the risk of the anger of God!'</p>
                                 <p>"This is not trifling. 'Tis a fact that we are 'man and wife,'
                                    and what we have got of money has been gotten by both—neither
                                    one had much to start with—hence, what there is belongs to both
                                    and none other.</p>
                                 <p>"Remember, also, what I suffered by receiving James into our
                                    house in Oregon, and I can never again trust to the chance of
                                    putting myself in the power of your relatives. They have injured
                                    me, and are still injuring me; and they would not care if I were
                                    a beggar in the streets if they had your money. <emph>Why</emph>
                                    this favor to you now? When you were poor in '43 they could send
                                    you from their house, but now how differently do they treat you?
                                    I cannot go to New York, but would like to see you here
                                    exceedingly. I have in view the purchase of a beautiful place
                                    near by with two pretty houses. One has been built nine years,
                                    the other <emph>one.</emph> The whole, with land well improved,
                                    has been offered for three thousand dollars. I expect to get it
                                    for two thousand five hundred; fifteen hundred to be paid in
                                    cash; the rest to remain on interest till I can earn it, unless
                                    you will give it to me. I have made engagements for the printing
                                    and publication of my books; they will be out as soon as I can
                                    re-write them. I have bought a piano and am taking lessons;
                                    succeed very well. I have also bought a pair of canary birds,
                                    male and female, which will not sing a note till you come!</p>
                                 <p>"You see by my engagements that I cannot be ready to go with you
                                    at the time you name, neither would such haste be best.</p>
                                 <p>"<emph>Do</emph>, my husband, gratify me enough to come and see
                                    me immediately! I want your opinion of the place in view; 'tis
                                    very pleasant and cheap; three persons have already applied to
                                    rent one of the houses, but I cannot pay for it till I have your
                                    approval. <emph>Dear</emph> Doctor, your interest lies nearer my
                                    heart than that of any other person's living; and while I now
                                    write, with tears dropping profusely, God is witness that I
                                    desire your happiness more than my own life. <emph>Do</emph>
                                    take my advice ere it is too late; if not, preserve this letter
                                    and see if I am not right in predicting for you greater
                                    wretchedness than you have ever yet known, and irreparable
                                    sorrow. I do not wish to scare you, but if you do not wish to
                                    believe me, try it, and may God sustain me when I remember that
                                    the man whom of all others has the best seat in my affections is
                                    lonely and unhappy in the extreme in consequence of the ill
                                    advice of his enemies, and cannot retrace his steps. I have wept
                                    till my head aches violently. Do let me at least see you once
                                    more, for if you go, off in this manner, I shall not long
                                    sustain the shock, nor do I wish to.</p>

                     <p>Dr. Binney having informed her that it was impossible for him to leave then
                        to visit her, she went to New York, and found active preparations making for
                        him and his brother Thomas to go to Oregon.</p>
                     <p>The contract made by the brothers was that W. J. Binney should find the
                        capital for a quantity of goods they were to take to Oregon—should pay T.
                        Binney's passage and expenses—advance some money for his outfit and to pay
                        some debts and was to receive his pay in services rendered by T. Binney in
                        selling this merchandise. Long before they sailed he became satisfied that
                        he had acted unwisely, and would gladly have retraced his steps sufficiently
                        to have been released from his agreement with his brother, and at different
                        times hinted proposals of this kind; but he was bound in writing, and the
                        agreement was too advantageous to Thomas to be broken; and the latter could
                        only at these times curse Ruth for being, as he said, the cause of this
                        dissatisfaction, and by every suggestion in his power endeavored to induce
                        his brother to leave her in the States. This Dr. B. was not inclined to do;
                        and the female members of the family desiring "Tom's" advancement more than
                        anything else, endeavored to induce her to stay by telling her she was a
                        fool for going back with him to Oregon, for they did not see how anybody
                        could live with him; and they advised her to remain at home, as W. J. would
                        be obliged to maintain her—having first said among themselves that she had
                        money enough already for her support, and they should not encourage him to
                        give her any more.</p>
                     <p>Ruth would have liked to have remained in the States would her husband have
                        tarried with her, but being more anxious for him than for her own happiness
                        and prosperity, concluded that she would be better satisfied with herself in
                        the future if she were with him and sharing all his trials and knowing what
                        they were, rather<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC5702-00000086"/> than to be
                        living so remote from him, unacquainted with his wants and unable to relieve
                        them, merely to obtain ease and comfort for herself, and resolved to go. And
                        moreover the fact of Thomas Binney being with him—whom she knew to be of
                        dissipated and reckless habit—excited her more fully to a sense of her duty
                        to her husband, which she thought was nothing less than an entire devotion
                        to him while life should last.</p>
                     <p>Our limited space will not permit us to copy but a few items from the notes
                        on this return voyage. We find Ruth saying of a passenger who figured
                        largely afterwards at California: "Another passenger, a Doctor Lee, a young
                        man of intemperate habits, going to California, will soon be used up by the
                        vices of that place." And again: "Another young man, raised in New York (T.
                        Binney) and entirely tainted with the opinion that no other place will bear
                        any comparison with it! He has to speak, act, and try to behave just as the
                        New Yorkers do; while I often pity him for his limited knowledge of the
                        world, and of society in general. He is heavily in debt, yet his fingers are
                        loaded with gold rings, (the gold given by W. J. Binney,) and his wristbands
                        shrink with the weight of gold buttons and pins. The truth is, to
                           <emph>appear</emph> a gentleman he has had recourse to beggary and the
                        credit of all who would trust him. If a word be spoken about a watering
                        place within the limits of the United States, he at once makes it known that
                        he has been there. <emph>Irish</emph> New Yorkers are undoubtedly rightly
                        called '<emph>Sham</emph>- rock.' But I am at the last line of the page, so
                        good-bye <emph>Sham.</emph>
                     </p>
                     <p>"Our New Yorker last Sabbath proposed a game of cards as a pastime; the
                        Catholic priest said 'twould be no harm, as it was not God's day any how!
                        The fear of the captain detained them.</p>
                     <p>"Our captain seems to be in fear of the steward, who does pretty much as he
                        pleases with him. One day he had reserved no dessert for his master, and
                        told him when he came to the table he was going to make a bridge of his
                        nose. The captain quietly went without, although, when the second mate eat
                        his dinner, he had some dessert for him. This morning the captain told him
                        he ought to have had some fish for breakfast, as Mr. S. did not eat meat on
                        Friday, who said 'There is a plenty <emph>else</emph> on the table, sir!'
                        "The captain says this steward was his smuggler in Spain—carrying his silver
                        ashore in his market basket. No wonder he is now in the ascendancy.</p>
                     <p>"Two boys being set to scrape the deck in a very hot sun, one of them
                        exclaimed: 'Is there nothing better to be got by going to sea, than this?
                        'tis worth while to sell a farm to go to sea for this!'</p>
                     <p>"The captain permits me to go to his library, and there I saw to-day several
                        bibles given by the New York Bible Society, for seamen, safely stowed away
                        where they will not be read or hurt. Better far were they in the forecastle,
                        for then they would be prized, and read, and perhaps <emph>stolen</emph>;
                        but if so, the Word might be to the thief like fire shut up in his bones,
                        which at some time might burst forth and consume his sins. The bible could
                        not be in a better place than in the chest, or hands, or hammock of a
                        rascal! 'Tis good seed, carry it where we may.</p>
                     <p>"Last evening the sailors shaved the lads in the ship who had not "crossed
                        the line," and introduced them to Neptune as his sons.</p>
                     <p>"This was done by blackening one of the old sailors, putting an uncouth
                        dress on him and setting him upon a barrel ready to receive his newly
                        adopted children. The boys were then stripped to the waist one by one, their
                        faces daubed with tar and scraped with an iron hoop, then a bucket of salt
                        water was thrown over them, and they were brought to his Seaship and
                        introduced as his sons. He of course received them very graciously.</p>
                     <p>"Accidentally passing the catholic priest when not expected, an oath was
                        just slipping from his lips, although he is so careful to abstain from meats
                        on certain days! '<hi rend="i"/>Of what use are your fasts to Me? saith the

                     <p>We trust we shall not be accused of too great partiality for our friend Ruth
                        Rover, if we copy the following item found in her journal. When they had
                        been nearly four months out she says:</p>
                     <p>"The steward surprised me this morning by saying to me in the presence of
                        Dr. Binney: 'I have a nice little box, Mrs. Binney, that I mean to give to
                        you before we go on shore. It was my poor wife's, and I mean to give it to
                        you because I don't think any one can see you for any length of time and not
                        like you! and the captain, too, says he never saw a pleasanter woman!'</p>
                     <p>"Indeed! thought I, this is quite a feather in my cap, for at sea, if
                        anywhere, if there be evil in the heart it will show itself. I have made no
                        extra efforts, and indeed have been sometimes even <emph>careless</emph> of
                        pleasing. I have rarely taken things as they have come and made the best of
                        them. And this is perhaps the reason, I know no other, why I am thus
                        complimented by the steward."</p>
                     <p>Of the <emph>social</emph> pleasures Ruth enjoyed during this voyage we can
                        give some idea from the following:</p>
                     <p>"Our New Yorker and the Connecticut pill-maker, (Dr. Lee,) are the most
                        notorious blackguards I ever met! Their constant pastime is to make fun of
                        others. At the table and elsewhere they mimic and make faces, and talk much
                        in a deprecating tone of 'low origins,' low births, servants, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>"What a pity the young could not have the experience of after years, or
                        would not take the advice of older persons—their middle age and old age
                        would not then be the source of so much regret for wasted privileges and
                        debasing influences.</p>
                     <p>"The Connecticut pill-maker is a very disagreeable person to one of my
                        disposition. Whenever he can offend me he does it, and at table and
                        elsewhere tries to insult me by mimicking my downcast look. This is done in
                        company with the New York coxcomb, who encourages him and does the same
                        himself.</p>
                     <p>"Poor wicked souls! did they but know it, I would gladly assist them to
                        obtain that wisdom from above which would enlarge their hearts and so fill
                        them with blessedness that they would not need to have recourse to such
                        low-lived and scandalous employments for pleasure.</p>
                     <p>"I have accomplished considerable sewing during the voyage, but have been
                        very lonely most of the time. I have not found a social kindred spirit
                        during the passage! I have, however, enjoyed good and blessed seasons in
                        religious devotions, for which I bless the God of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>"Writing, sewing and reading alternately engage my attention, while at the
                        same time 'My mind to me a treasure is,' and affords me sweet repast by day
                        and night. I have less of social enjoyment here than any other on board, for
                        there is here no spirit congenial with my own with whom I may have
                        fellowship."</p>
                     <p>Dr. Binney had found amusement suited to his taste, in the company of Dr.
                        Lee and his brother, and was seldom in his wife's company. During the severe
                        weather off Cape Horn they were all three most of the time intoxicated,
                        drinking, as they said, to keep off the cold. And getting together in Dr.
                        Lee's room, would make merry by laughing at and cursing the violent plunging
                        and rolling of the vessel, and indulge in all other demoniacal ravings which
                        none can understand, who have not witnessed such outrages.</p>
                     <p>We have before us a letter written by Ruth to her husband at the latter part
                        of this voyage, and which evidently had been excited by the treatment of her
                        husband and brother-in-law during the voyage. We cannot make it public on
                        account of the allusions to Dr. Binney's conduct in. New York and elsewhere
                        being made in such plain terms as would shock the reader. A paragraph or two
                        will give some idea of its purport.</p>
                     <p>"And is it for this I am to live with<pb n="172-173"
                           xml:id="VAC5702-00000087"/> you in slavery and degradation all my days?
                        It is too common a thing to talk of the threats I have received to be
                        murdered by you, and the constantly ignominious names I am called, but my
                        character must be brought down to a level with yours as an excuse for your
                        misconduct I have labored like a slave to save money, and denied myself of
                        every comfort to gain enough for you to live away from scenes of vice, and
                        to pay the debts contracted by my leaving the Mission to marry you, and have
                        seen it all squandered on—. If strength is left me. and God permits us ever
                        to set foot on shore again, I mean to leave you if I die of hunger! You
                        wisely kept your abuse restrained a little before we started, but I am awake
                        now, and all my past sufferings come freshly into my mind. * * * If I were
                        breathing my last breath I could breathe it in prayers that you might meet
                        the punishment which is your due. I believe you will if God is just, and I
                        know he is, and he has seen and known all the sufferings and exposures I
                        have met from you.</p>
                     <p>"I can hardly close, so great is the indignation I feel toward you! To
                        think. in addition to every other abuse I have suffered for twelve years,
                        that a mean beggar of an upstart must be employed by my <emph>husband</emph>
                        to proclaim to strangers that I am a w—e, and have received presents from
                           <emph>Kanakas</emph> to that effect!! Yes, a <emph>husband</emph> to
                        employ such a one in such a business, to get his wife abhorred and despised
                        that his own sins may not show out!"</p>
                     <p>'Tis said there is a time when forbearance ceases to be a virtue, and
                        sometimes Ruth seemed to have come to it, but it was only to surrender again
                        and suffer more.</p>
                     <p>In the course of the voyage Ruth had thought that, for the sake of a little
                        rest, she would remain in California for the winter, it being November when
                        they arrived; and on making this proposal to Dr. Binney, and he having
                        consulted his brother who was highly pleased with the project. Dr. B.
                        engaged board for her at Rev. Mr. Wheeler's, and accompanied her on shore,
                        taking a part of her clothing and promising to send her the rest and call
                        again and bring her money to pay her expenses. The time arrived for the
                        departure of the steamer, and no more word had been received from him. Mr.
                        W. advised her to ride with him to the wharf and ascertain the cause, when
                        they found the boat about starting; and Dr. Binney being in liquor—and also
                        his brother—told her he did not intend to give her any money nor to let her
                        have her things. Mr. Wheeler advised her to take passage in the boat and go
                        to Oregon with him. and himself made arrangements with the captain to that
                        effect. Dr. Binney and his wife occupied separate rooms and did not appear
                        to recognize each other. In two days the steamer put back for better coal,
                        when, as Mrs. Binney was now going to Oregon, Dr. Binney was advised by
                        "Tom" and the infamous Dr. Lee and a b'hoy they had met in the person of Mr.
                        Spencer, to tarry <emph>himself</emph> in California and let his wife go
                        where she pleased. Meantime Thos. Binney received charge of the goods, which
                        were in a vessel bound to Columbia river, and was entrusted with three
                        thousand dollars in cash, all that now remained of the sixteen thousand Dr.
                        B. had when leaving Oregon. Mrs. B. tried to expostulate with her husband,
                        but, being in liquor and urged by his brother, she could make no impression
                        upon his mind, and he only told her he "did not know her; she was only his
                        mistress anyhow, and what right had she to stop him!" He went on shore, and
                        the steamer left again, and the winds and waves seemed combined to make it
                        necessary that they should not throw a Jonah overboard, but return to San
                        Francisco to get one left there.</p>
                     <p>In two days the engine had broken and they were obliged to turn about once
                        more, and when arrived at the harbor Dr. Binney was almost the first on
                        board and in his wife's state-room asking forgiveness, and permission to go
                        with her to Oregon.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Lee had succeeded in borrowing a sum of money of Dr. Binney, having been
                        "kicked out" of his hotel for not paying his board, and had gone off no one
                        knew where; and Thomas, thinking his brother had gone to the mines, went on
                        shore, and before he met Dr. Binney had expended forty dollars of the money
                        entrusted to his care.</p>
                     <p>There now occurred a turn about: Dr. Binney became enraged at his brother,
                        and on their arrival in Oregon was greatly inclined not to suffer him to
                        have any dealings with the merchandise belonging to him, and well would it,
                        have been for him if he had not.</p>
                     <p>At Portland Ruth Rover was subjected to a very unpleasant occurrence, and as
                        it very clearly reveals the suspicious character of her husband, we shall
                        enter somewhat into details.</p>
                     <p>The second day at her boarding-house, having no employment, she asked a Miss
                        Wood, who was sewing, if she should not assist her. Miss W. replied, "I
                        would be very glad if you would; and if you please you may make these
                        collars which I'm to have finished before Christmas." Ruth busied herself,
                        and by evening had made two, and was working on the third; the two that were
                        finished lying upon the table before her when her husband came in. He
                        stopped before the table a moment, looking first at Ruth and then at the
                        collars, and finally, taking them in his hands, he said:</p>
                     <p>"Who are these for—are they for me?"</p>
                     <p>"No," replied Ruth, "they are for <emph>Miss Wood.</emph>"</p>
                     <p>His scarlet face became crimson; his small deep eyes brightened and
                        contracted at the corners, as if to say, <hi rend="i"/>Now I've caught you!
                        He threw them upon the table, but said nothing, as there were three of the
                        gentlemen boarders present, and went quickly to his room. Ruth, soon after,
                        finding herself alone with the gentlemen, and having finished her work, went
                        into the dining-room, and taking a book sat down by the fire.</p>
                     <p>Presently Dr. Binney entered? and giving her a tap on the shoulder,
                        said:</p>
                     <p>"Here! go into your room."</p>
                     <p>She rose, and as her only course then was to "obey." she walked on before
                        him.</p>
                     <p>When they were inside the room, Dr. Binney locked the door and put the key
                        into his pocket.</p>
                     <p>"Now sit down <emph>there</emph> and read," said he, "or else go to your
                        bed."</p>
                     <p>"What is the matter with you?" asked Ruth.</p>
                     <p>"I'll let you know presently, d—n you," he answered.</p>
                     <p>Ruth read tome time, while he sat and looked at her, his eyes sparkling and
                        contracting, and his breathing becoming laborious, as if meditating
                        something of importance.</p>
                     <p>The evening being very chilly, Ruth told him she wished to go out to the
                        fire.</p>
                     <p>"No," said he, "you will not leave this room again to-night!"</p>
                     <p>"Why, what ails you?"</p>
                     <p>"Don't speak to me, you d—d w—e of h—ll," said he.</p>
                     <p>Ruth saw it was useless, and retired to her bed. In the morning, when she
                        thought he might be in a better temper, she asked him what was the cause of
                        his ill feelings towards her, when he, in great anger, replied—</p>
                     <p>"G—d d—n you, shut up, or by G—d I'll kill you!" at the same time raising a
                        stick of wood from the hearth over her head in a threatening attitude.</p>
                     <p>Ruth retired to her room, grieved, but thinking time would bring an
                        explanation. At evening, it being the Sabbath, the lady of the
                        boarding-house invited them to go to church. Dr. Binney objected to going,
                        as he said he had business in town to attend to. He went out and soon
                        returned, when Ruth asked him again, but he said he was going to bed. He
                        went to his room and got into bed with his clothes on. Ruth asked him again
                        if he would not go, as it would be a pleasure to her, having been so long at
                        sea; but he refused, when Mrs. M. said—</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps he'll be willing you should go without him. Mr. C. is going with
                        me, and I would like to have your company too."</p>
                     <p>Ruth asked if she should go without him, and he told her to "Go, go, if you
                        want to."</p>
                     <p>When at the church and waiting at the door for the conclusion of prayer, Dr.
                        Binney entered in haste, and passing by Ruth; who tried to stop him, he
                        hurried on to the body of the church. Returning<pb n="174-175"
                           xml:id="VAC5702-00000088"/> ing, he kept some distance behind her but did
                        not speak.</p>
                     <p>Retiring to her room, Dr. B. locked her in as before, and she having retired
                        he sat by the candle and was for some time very busy in examining her
                        papers, journals, &amp;c., laying by themselves such as he pleased, and
                        finally commenced to burn them, lighting them by the candle.</p>
                     <p>
                        <emph>This</emph> Ruth could not consent to, and catching the papers from
                        his hand she blew out the light. Dr. Binney immediately commenced making
                        some movement about the head of the bed, which Ruth thought might be an
                        effort to obtain his pistols. She arose, and having an opportunity she
                        endeavored to ascertain if he had taken them, and in so doing her hand came
                        upon his gold watch lying between them and in danger of being injured by
                        them, or of falling upon the floor. She took it and put it by with her
                        papers.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Binney soon after went quietly to rest, and the night being past he
                        arose early, and while dressing, with many reproaches and curses, told his
                        wife he was going to leave her that day—that he was glad the steamer was not
                        gone—that he thanked God he was now satisfied of the fact he had long
                        suspected—and that she might look to him no more for assistance or a living,
                        for he was fully determined to abandon her to those she loved better than
                        himself, &amp;c., &amp;c. All of which Ruth did not understand and she could
                        get no explanation from him. But it being similar conduct to what she had
                        many times witnessed, it did not give her particular uneasiness, only that
                        she feared that the steamer of which he spoke might be about departing and
                        that through his precipitancy he might take some rash step which could not
                        be easily remedied.</p>
                     <p>He went out saying she would never see his face again—taking no clothing,
                        but saying he should send for them—and did not, apparently, think of his
                        watch.</p>
                     <p>Ruth concluded that, whether he went away or not, it was a better and
                        cheaper way to hire rooms and keep house than to pay a high price for board,
                        and as Dr. Binney had, in the first place, tried to obtain a small house,
                        she now, having heard of one to rent, engaged it at her own expense, and
                        prepared to move into it.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Binney's trunks she did not like to leave in the boarding house, and he
                        having much linen to be washed, after the voyage, she prepared them to take
                        with her, desiring Mrs. M—, if he should return, to tell him that she had
                        taken his trunks for the purpose of washing his linen, and he could have
                        them by coming to her house, it being but a few steps distance.</p>
                     <p>The <choice>
                           <sic>draymen</sic>
                           <corr>drayman</corr>
                        </choice> had them on his cart with hers and was leaving the house when Dr.
                        Binney returned and ordered them to he taken into the house.</p>
                     <p>Ruth desired the man to take <emph>her</emph> trunks to her house, but Dr.
                        Binney ordered him to return them all to the house where he took them from.
                        Ruth saw no alternative but to go without them. She had thought to remain at
                        the boarding house but her husband told her to go away, as she had started
                        to do, and not attempt to stop at a house where he was.</p>
                     <p>She bought a baker's loaf for her subsistence through the day, and at night
                        slept upon the floor before the fire, with two dirty saddle blankets she had
                        found in the house for her bedding.</p>
                     <p>Early in the morning she went to Dr. Binney's room, he being yet in bed, and
                        commenced folding a dress she had left hanging on the wall, when he jumped
                        up and told her: "No! d—n your soul! you don't get a d—d thing here! Go out
                        of this!—d—n you, be off!" and pushed her out of the room.</p>
                     <p>She returned again and attempted to take her things, saying that all she
                        wanted was her clothing.</p>
                     <p>He refused, and they contended, and finally he seized her firmly by the
                        throat and attempted to put her altogether from the house. Coming near the
                        front door, she cleared herself from him, and seeing her advantage, she
                        sprang back into her bed room, and in her turn turned the key on her
                        husband.</p>
                     <p>He immediately sending for "Tom," commenced storming at the door,
                        threatening to burst it in and take her life if she did not open it, and
                        when he once got hold of her again she should not leave his hands alive!</p>
                     <p>Ruth feared his violence if he should succeed in forcing the door, and
                        seeing the money on the bed, all that he had, she took it in her hand, and
                        making her escape by the window, entered the kitchen door.</p>
                     <p>"Tom" had arrived, and Dr. Binney had told him to go and stand by the window
                        of her room, for what purpose we do not know, lest she should escape that
                        way. He, however, did not attempt to stop her, but gave information to his
                        brother of her having gone into the other part of the house, where she was
                        followed immediately.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Binney approaching her she told him to put his hands upon her if he
                        dared. There being several persons present in the dining room, Ruth went
                        into it, thereby to feel the more secure. He replied to her calmly he was
                        not going to harm her, he only wanted the <emph>money</emph> she had
                        got.</p>
                     <p>Many altercations ensued, Ruth giving as the reasons of her conduct, that
                        she had only attempted to take her clothing, which she could not do without
                        as she had no money to buy more—that he refused to let her have it—that
                        there being now but a little more than two thousand dollars remaining of all
                        they had taken home—that she had a right to some of it—that he was
                        permitting Thomas Binney to expend, in every luxury and dissipation, the
                        money which belonged to them—and that as she could not get her clothes, she
                        thought she had a right to some, especially as the goods he had brought from
                        New York he had put out of his hands at San Francisco to prevent her from
                        obtaining anything in case she should sue him for her support.</p>
                     <p>He then told her he wanted his money, and if she did not give it to him he
                        would tear her clothes off her there, in presence of them all, and take
                        it.</p>
                     <p>She having put it into her pocket, she told him if he put his hands on her
                        for that purpose she would hurt him if she could.</p>
                     <p>"But you can't do that, you've nothing to defend yourself with," said he,
                        tauntingly, approaching still nearer. "O, yes," he continued, "there is a
                        bell on the shelf—and there is a <emph>flat-iron</emph> by your chair;
                        better take that."</p>
                     <p>"Very well," said Ruth, "if you say so I'll take it," and she raised it to
                        her lap.</p>
                     <p>"But," said he, "where is my watch?"</p>
                     <p>Ruth feeling angry and not much like indulging him, answered: "I have not
                        got your watch."</p>
                     <p>He told her he knew she had, when she said: "Your watch is safe, and you can
                        have it and your money too, whenever you resign my clothing, that is all I
                        want—and you know that both are safe in my possession."</p>
                     <p>He would come to no agreement, and Ruth went home.</p>
                     <p>At noon she went there again, and sitting in the dining room a young, illy
                        dressed man entered and accosted her very familiarly, telling her he was "an
                        officer" on board the Chenamus on a former passage with her. She could not
                        recall him at all to mind.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Binney not coming to dinner, she went to his room, and finding the door
                        shut and hearing two voices, she listened a moment and perceived she was the
                        subject of conversation. She felt impelled to return immediately to her
                        house; and having passed about half way she looked back and perceived Dr.
                        Binney and this same young man standing upon the piazza looking after her.
                        She hurried on, and soon found herself safe in her own house.</p>
                     <p>Not long after, Dr. Binney's anger having passed the meridian, he
                        surrendered himself to her wishes, and went to live with her, acknowledging
                        the fault was entirely his own, the affair of the <emph>collars</emph>
                        having caused it all—he thinking she was making them for some lover and
                        trying to conceal the fact by saying they were for <emph>Miss
                        Wood</emph>—adding:</p>
                     <p>"I have got a h—ll of a temper, and I don't know what ails me."</p>
                     <p>"But who," said Ruth, "was the little man who spoke to me and said he was an
                        officer on the <choice>
                           <sic>Cheuamus</sic>

                        </choice>?"</p>
                     <p>"Why, that was the marshal of Portland!"</p>
                     <p>"The <emph>marshal of Portland!</emph> and what was he doing there?"</p>
                     <p>"He was going to <emph>strip you</emph> and get the money!"</p>
                     <pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC5702-00000089"/>
                     <p>"Why, who was he—I never saw him on the Chenamus as I remember?"</p>
                     <p>"Don't you remember that little fellow who used to go about deck hammering
                        the iron rings, &amp;c.?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes; and he used to 'slush' the masts!"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, yes, that's the very fellow!"</p>
                     <p>"And <emph>he's the marshal of Portland?</emph>"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, <emph>he's the marshal of Portland!</emph>"</p>
                     <p>"And he was going to <emph>strip me?</emph>"</p>
                     <p>"Yes."</p>
                     <p>"Well, 'tis well he did not attempt it, for he would have found
                           <emph>himself</emph> stripped about as soon!"</p>
                     <p>While living in this house of Ruth's hiring, she found all the provisions,
                        yet, however, got soon discouraged by his destroying frequently the food she
                        provided, saying it was "not fit for a dog to eat;" and one Saturday
                        evening, she having boiled a leg of pork to eat cold on the Sabbath that she
                        might be able to attend church; he threw the contents of his supper, and it,
                        with the dishes, into the fire, where she let them remain till consumed, the
                        dishes being all broken. She then told him he might maintain himself, for
                        she would expend no more to be wasted in that manner.</p>
                     <p>After various other troubles, which we cannot recapitulate here, we find
                        them living at Butteville, Dr. Binney having purchased a house and four lots
                        for one thousand dollars. He had taken a part of his goods to Butteville and
                        opened a store there, but liquors constituting a large part of his stock, he
                        was, while here, most all of the time intoxicated.</p>
                     <p>It will be impossible, in this number of our work, to detail the particulars
                        of the disagreement of Dr. Binney and his wife, while here, but we will do
                        so elsewhere if we have an opportunity. Suffice it now to say that such was
                        his reckless course and the power of Thomas Binney over him, that Ruth
                        resolved that before everything was gone she would apply for a bill of
                        divorce, and endeavor to obtain something of the property. Thomas Binney had
                        surrendered the papers which had placed the goods at his disposal when at
                        San Francisco; and Dr. Binney, suspecting that his wife intended to leave
                        him, sent to Portland for his brother, and while his wife was on a visit to
                        a friend's, sold whatever was at Butteville at a great discount, and
                        commenced arrangements for securing the balance at Portland, so that, as he
                        said, she could "not touch it."</p>
                     <p>Ruth, becoming aware of this, hastened to Linn City for advice and to
                        endeavor to prevent the consummation of this plan. Finding a lawyer she made
                        application to the Hon. Judge Pratt for a "bill," and to have some part of
                        Dr. Binney's property secured to her.</p>
                     <p>We need not present her complaints in this petition, as Dr. Binney's
                        answer—which we shall give—will make them apparent. We shall, however,
                        notice the doings of the <emph>Judge</emph> on this occasion, in order to
                        show the difference of feeling between him and the one who ultimately had
                        the decision of the case, viz: between the honorable judges, 0. C. Pratt and
                        George H. Williams.</p>

                     <p>"THE ANSWER OF WILLIAM J. BINNEY TO THE BILL OF COMPLAINT OF RUTH BINNEY,
                        COMPLAINANT."</p>
                     <p>"This defendant reserving to himself all the right of exception to the said
                        bill of complaint, for answer thereunto, saith:</p>
                     <p>* * * * * "That true it is that some time before said marriage defendant
                        became impressed with the importance of religion, but that such impressions
                        were afterwards materially, as the defendant believes, impaired by
                        perceiving that the walk and conversation of complainant, a professor of
                        religion, so far from being in accordance with her professions, were, and
                        continued to be, and still are, as hereinafter set forth.</p>
                     <p>"That it is true that prior to said marriage, defendant had been robbed by
                        Indians, and had lost much property by them; but it is not true that
                        defendant then was, or in the then circumstances of the country was,
                        considered to be very poor.</p>
                     <p>"That he had taken and then resided upon a good and valuable land claim at
                        Champoeg, in said Territory, with complainant. That he was possessed of
                        horses, [cattle] and other property; but not of much money, of which there
                        was then but little in this Territory; and that defendant and complainant
                        enjoyed all the usual outward comforts of life which the country
                        afforded.</p>
                     <p>"That from a time shortly after the said marriage to the time of their first
                        departure for the States, in the year 1842, defendant was greatly grieved
                        and disappointed in the conduct of complainant; that while she fully
                        possessed and occasionally exercised all the qualifications calculated to
                        make a home comfortable, she was frequently sulky and morose—at other times
                        irritable often striving, by her [taunts and insulting language and conduct,
                        to annoy defendant and provoke defendant into retaliatory expressions.]</p>
                     <p>"That true it is defendant and complainant returned from New York to Oregon
                        Territory about April, 1844, when they again lived on same land claim, which
                        defendant had previously sold for $300 and re-purchased at $750, and
                        continued to reside there till about April, 1850, at which time defendant
                        possessed stock, property of various kinds; was in all respects comfortably
                        situated, and, as defendant believes, in independent circumstances; yet the
                        afore-described conduct of complainant increased in virulence and
                        bitterness. She became dissatisfied with the country, and desirous of
                        returning, though not on a visit, wrongfully implied in said bill, but to
                        reside permanently in the States. That although contrary to defendant's own
                        views, yet with: the desire to gratify complainant, [and in hopes that
                        thereby her temper and conduct to defendant might become improved,] he
                        consented to return; and [on her account thus sacrificed what to them, and
                        still believes to have been, permanent prospects of success in life; and
                        again left Oregon about April, 1850, for the States.] That the conduct of
                        complainant did not improve during said<pb n="178-179"
                           xml:id="VAC5702-00000090"/> last-named absence, and defendant again
                        returned with complainant to Oregon about the month of December, 1851. That
                        defendant and complainant remained in Portland, as stated in said bill, a
                        few weeks, and then defendant went to Butteville, in said Marion county,
                        where he purchased a house and four lots of land, which he still owns, and
                        where defendant resides.</p>
                     <p>"That true it is when about leaving Oregon in April, 1850, defendant sold
                        cows and horses, and other things, to about the sum of $2,700; but it is not
                        true that said stock was raised by the personal labor and attention of
                        complainant, nor that [five or six of the horses as sold were the produce of
                        a mare purchased at the time of defendant's marriage, with funds of
                        complainant;] that a portion of said stock sold was purchased by
                        defendant—other portions were received by him on account of professional
                        services as a physician—[some were loaned on shares, and had been kept at
                        other places than the homestead of defendant, and their increase never even
                        seen by complainant.] That the mare named in said bill was a small Indian
                        poney purchased for fifteen dollars, [and which died some few years after;
                        and to the best of defendant's recollection and belief, but one of the

                     <p>"That true it is complainant was capable and generally did aid and assist
                        defendant in his affairs; but that defendant bought and sold and [raised
                        stock,] and attended to his said other professional business, peaceably and
                        industriously, and [thereby] accumulated the means which he possessed at the
                        time aforesaid.</p>
                     <p>"That true it is the defendant did, for the purpose above in this answer
                        stated, sell his said land, claim at auction and received therefor the sum
                        of twelve hundred and seventy-five dollars.</p>
                     <p>"That true it is defendant is possessed at this time of goods, or their
                        proceeds, which cost in New York about seven thousand dollars, and of
                        property consisting of houses and lots, as in said bill stated.</p>
                     <p>"1 That defendant distinctly denies that he has ever, since his marriage,
                        treated complainant, continuously or otherwise, cruelly or injuriously, or
                        in any wise either endangered her life or given her any just cause to
                        believe that he ever intended so to do. 2 That defendant has not even
                        offered indignities intolerable, or otherwise, to the person of complainant.
                        That [defendant denies that he has been since the summer of 1839 to the
                        present time, or at any time, or that he now is, addicted to habitual
                        intemperance.] That true it is defendant is not of that cold and phlegmatic
                        temperament that can submit with indifference to the [irritating, galling,
                        insulting and abusive language which complainant has often, from time to
                        time, poured forth upon him for the purpose, as defendant then and still
                        believes, of goading him into anger,] and defendant may not always, under
                        such continued and wholly [unjustifiable provocation,] have exhibited
                        perfect equanimity of temper; but he does deny that even such strong
                        provocation has ever driven defendant to the conduct stated in said
                        bill.</p>
                     <p>"That complainant appeared to be laboring under constant suspicion of
                        defendant's fidelity to her, and very frequently accused him of improper
                        intercourse with other females; [that all such charges, so made by
                        complainant, are and have always been, utterly groundless and false. That
                        complainant, from the frequency with which she repeated these charges, the
                        number and [respectability] of the persons with whom she accused defndt. of
                        such improper intercourse, and the strong language and [violent manner] with
                        which she urged such charges [appeared to be either constantly seeking a
                        cause of quarrel with defendant,] or to be laboring under something
                        approaching an imagination [morbid] in this particular.</p>
                     <p>"That it is wholly untrue that defendant, in 1844, or at any time, at table
                        or elsewhere, struck complainant a violent blow with his fist, or otherwise,
                        thereby causing permanent or any other injury.</p>
                     <p>"That it is not true that in 1842, or at any time, defendant struck
                        complainant several, or any, violent blows upon her naked arms, with a whip,
                        in the presence ence of any third person; 5 nor did defendant then, or at
                        any other time drive complainant out of the house.</p>
                     <p>"That it is not true, as stated in said bill, that some time in the year
                        1846, or at any time, that defendant, when drunk, ordered complainant to
                        come to bed, and in consequence of her refusal, or otherwise, rushed towards
                        or attempted to take a musket, or other deadly weapon, for the purpose as
                        stated in said bill, or other purpose; but true it is about the time in that
                        behalf in said bill stated, [complainant became, as then frequently
                        happened, morose and obstinate,] and refused to come to defendant's bed, and
                        on defendant enjoining her so to do complainant left the room and went to
                        sleep in the same room with an Indian woman; that defendant admits that he
                        was thereupon angry at this improper conduct of complainant, 7 but denies
                        using any violence towards her, or putting her in fear. That true it is that
                        the [sulkiness and obstinacy of complainant still continuing,] she went the
                        next day to the Willamette falls, where she remained until brought back by
                        the defendant, [but not, as wrongfully stated in said bill,] on defendant's
                        promise to conduct himself towards complainant otherwise, but, [as defendant
                        believes, because the complainant had then, for the time at least, regretted
                        her own conduct.]</p>
                     <p>"That it is not true that in the spring of 1850, or at any other time,
                        [complainant heard defendant and his brother, James Binney, making
                        arrangements to take what money there then was in the house and go to the
                        gold mines, and abandon complainant,] without the means of subsistence, [or
                        any other conversation to that effect;] nor did defendant express such
                        intention, except under the circumstances and in the manner following. That
                        it is not true that defendant ran complainant out of the house; that it is
                        not true that [defendant caught <choice>
                           <sic>complaint</sic>
                           <corr>complainant</corr>
                        </choice> by the hair and dragged her into the house, and abused her
                        brutally, or otherwise; that it is not true that defendant injured
                        complainant's hip, or otherwise, as stated] in said bill. But it is true
                        that at the time in that behalf specified, defendant had in the house about
                        ten thousand dollars in gold, and considered it too large an amount to be
                        there kept with safety, and was anxious to find a more secure place of
                        deposit, for safe keeping [only,] and remarked to complainant that he
                        thought he had better deposit with Dr. J. McLaughlin, or some other good
                        man, for safety, to which [complainant violently objected with much
                        obstinacy;] that soon after, defendant wishing to go to the Willamette falls
                        requested his said brother to get a horse for him; that complainant
                        suspecting defendant meant to take the said money with him for the purpose
                        aforesaid, took between [five and six thousand dollars] from its usual place
                        of deposit, and concealed it from defendant; that on defendant discovering
                        that the money was gone he called his said brother and showed him the trunk
                        from which it had been taken, and irritated by this interference with his
                        affairs, and this further addition to the previous annoying conduct of
                        complainant, used expressions to his brother to this effect: "I have a good
                        mind to let her take this money and go to the devil—I can go to the mines,
                        and by hard work, again do something for myself." That complainant took
                        [said money,] so abstracted, and carried it away to the Buttes, where
                        defendant, some few weeks subsequently, after much difficulty, succeeded in
                        again obtaining possession of it.</p>
                     <p>"That it is not true, as stated in said bill, that [defendant, at Panama, in
                        1850, or at any time, whilst complainant was ill, abandoned complainant
                        among strangers, and spent his time in drunkenness;] but true it is that
                        complainant was unwell on the said passage to Panama, but had in part
                        recovered on arrival there. That true it is on the occasion of a dinner
                        given by the passengers to Captain Hunt, for his kindness and gentlemanly
                        conduct on the passage, defendant, with other gentlemen present, may have
                        exceeded the bounds of strict sobriety, [but in no way to the detriment] or
                        injury of complainant, [or at other times more than the said occasion;] but
                        it is also true that defendant had at that time with him a large sum of
                        money, and from indications<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC5702-00000091"/>
                        dications feared to cross the Isthmus at that time, and intended to remain
                        at Panama a day or two and then cross to the other side, and notified
                        complainant of such his intention; [that defendant, notwithstanding,
                        forthwith] proceeded to pack up all of complainant and defendant's trunks
                        and other things, [including the money,] and expressed her intention to go
                        on at once. That defendant again objected, whereupon [she, complainant,
                        called the mate of the vessel] on which they had come down from Panama, into
                        the room, and in defendant's hearing requested him, the said mate, to take
                        charge of her, said complainant, and her effects, across the Isthmus; that
                        defendant [ordered the mate out of the room and forbid his interference in
                        his, defendant's family or affairs;] that defendant then left the house for
                        a short time and on his return found that complainant had left the house;
                        that after enquiring for some time for complainant and being unable to
                        obtain any information respecting her, defendant determined to go to
                        Valparaiso, but did not leave Panama at that time; that [complainant had
                        then with her from three hundred to five hundred dollars.]</p>
                     <p>"That soon after, with the aid of the captain, Hunt, defendant found
                        complainant, and they afterwards crossed together and proceeded to New
                        York.</p>
                     <p>"That true it is while at New York in 1851, complainant visited her mother
                        in Massachusetts; but it is also true that on that occasion defendant
                        accompanied complainant and conducted her to her mother's from New York, and
                        then returned to New York. That it is entirely untrue [that defendant
                        squandered in dissipation and licentiousness about $3000, or any other sum]
                        as stated in said bill. And this defendant states, [that any assertion that
                        he then contracted the venereal disease to be an unmitigated falsehood, and
                        fully believes that the statement and testimony of complainant's belief that
                        such was the case to be utterly and absolutely false.]</p>
                     <p>"That before crossing the Isthmus on the said last-named occasion of
                        returning to New York, defendant gave complainant a draft for the sum of
                        $2000, which sum complainant received of said defendant in New York, and
                        placed at interest in Massachusetts, and as defendant [fully believes still
                        has the sum] free from all control of this defendant, [who has allowed] and
                        still allows and intends to allow her to have and use it as her own.</p>
                     <p>"That it is untrue that [defendant by promises induced complainant to return
                        to him]; that complainant returned willingly and of her own accord to
                        defendant, and to Oregon, where defendant considered it best for his
                        business prospects he should return. That the statement of [defendant
                        attempting to abandon complainant at San Francisco in the month of October,
                        1851, or at any time; and also the statement that defendant called
                        complainant his mistress and used other abusive language to complainant is
                        all absolutely untrue;] that complainant had at this time about $500 in her
                        hand; that the statement in said bill that [defendant at Portland (or any
                        where) in 1852, (or any time) drew a stick of wood over complainant's head,
                        and used the expression in that behalf in said bill stated, or any such
                        language is wholly untrue.]</p>
                     <p>"That during their stay in Portland this defendant treated complainant with
                        his usual courtesy and kindness, while she conducted herself with her
                        customary [violence] of language and conduct, [and on one occasion, while
                        there, raised a smoothing-iron to strike defendant.] That defendant
                        absolutely denies that [he took, or was detected by complainant in 1852, or
                        any other time, in taking indecent liberties with any female, or that he
                        made proposals of connubial intercourse with any one, or that he struck or
                        in any wise abused complainant for speaking of such subjects.</p>
                     <p>"That true it is that defendant frequently, in the course of his
                        professional practice, received visits from ladies for the purpose of
                        medical advice and assistance for themselves or their children; and that the
                           <emph>morbid</emph> spirit of jealousy which [seemed constantly to
                        possess complainant and govern her conduct,] frequently led her to practice
                        a system of espionage upon the defendant and his patients] most annoying to
                        him, both as a physician and as a husband. That on one occasion. and long
                        after defendant had tried all fair and reasonable means in view to disabuse
                        the mind of complainant of this her prevailing [false idea, defendant
                        detected complainant personally watching him at his own house] while
                        attending a little child there seriously ill, in its mother's arms, and
                        requiring and receiving the care and attention both of defendant and its
                        mother; that to that moment defendant's [sole attention had been devoted to
                        relieve the child;] that it was neither [a time nor place,] nor were the
                        [circumstances or the character of the person such as even—if (which he
                        positively denies) [he ever entertained so base a wish] as stated in said

                        degrading an intention.] That smarting under the irritation of [detecting
                        complainant] under such circumstances [in such an employment.] defendant, in
                        a spirit of retaliation, and [in that spirit and for that object alone,] did
                        make use of a single expression [expressly intended to excite the jealousy
                        of complainant;] and on no other occasion did he ever condescend to such
                        mode of retaliation. That while the defendant does not, in strict propriety,
                        justify this expression, and regrets having used it, he respectfully submits
                        the whole circumstances attending it to this honorable court.</p>
                     <p>"That defendant denies the whole statement in said bill contained of
                        presenting a pistol at complainant, or threatening to lay her flat on the

                        [spirit of arrogance which has so longed marked her conduct;] that defendant
                        expressly denies that complainant was [induced to do so either by cruel
                        treatment or threats of personal violence on his part.] That so far from
                        complainant having used her best endeavors to live with defendant, as his
                        wife, in peace and quietness, she has been jealous and suspicious [without
                        cause,] sulky and irritating [without provocation,] harsh and ungovernable
                        in temper and deportment, without attempting to restrain her [bursts of
                        passion,] and on very many occasions, as defendant [believes, for the,
                        purpose of irritating defendant.]</p>
                     <p>"That in the year 1847 complainant, [without cause,] left the house of
                        defendant at Champoeg and went down to Oregon City, and remained there about
                        two weeks. That during the absence of defendant from house at that time,
                        complainant returned to his house and broke open a trunk and took therefrom
                        about $500 in gold and silver, and also some other things, and took also two
                        horses of defendant and returned to Oregon City therewith. That defendant,
                        after about a fortnight, succeeded in obtaining back the silver, in part,
                        but that [about 2 to $300 in gold have not yet been received by
                        defendant.]</p>
                     <p>"That defendant has proceeded, and is still proceeding in the usual course
                        of business, and not otherwise, and not for the reasons set out in said
                        bill, to dispose of his merchandise and other personal property from time to
                        time and as he can do so to advantage."</p>
                     <p>Usual conclusion, praying dissolution of<pb n="182-183"
                           xml:id="VAC5702-00000092"/> injunction, that bill be not granted, and
                        against alimony and expenses.</p>
                     <p>We shall make but a few comments on the foregoing "Answer," as we intend to
                        review it fully, if practicable. The reader will perceive that throughout
                        there is no accusation against the conduct of Ruth Rover otherwise than as
                        she is said to be "sulky, morose and irritating in her language, and, as
                        defendant believes, for the purpose of irritating him to anger." This is
                        said to have been "without cause." We wonder, if such were the case, what
                        would have been Ruth's object in exciting to anger an innocent, harmless and
                        inoffensive man. Was it because she so much liked troubles of that kind? It
                        must have been.</p>
                     <p>Again, of the money left in Mr. Holmes' hands, of which he says there were
                        from two to three hundred dollars missing when he received it again of Mrs.
                        Jeffrey's. When Ruth Rover received the money of Mrs. Holmes it was counted
                        and found to be the exact amount delivered to Mr. Holmes the day before. It
                        can be proven by the boy who carried it for her to Oregon City, that Ruth
                        did not open it on the way, and by Mrs. J. that she saw it not again, after
                        she delivered it to her, till Dr. Binney counted it before her in Mrs. J.'s
                        house. When he did so he remarked to Mr. Kanady that he believed some of the
                        gold was gone, as there was not as much gold as he thought there should be.
                        There was the full amount of money, viz., $500, or near it, and Ruth
                        understood him to mean that the proportion of gold to the silver was not as
                        great as he had supposed it to be; and the conclusion is, if any of the
                        money was missing, it must have occurred while in Mrs. J.'s hands, which
                        thought cannot for a moment be indulged.</p>
                     <p>Further, Dr. Binney states that the mare, of which his wife speaks, died in
                        a few years after their marriage. The Rev. Mr. Bolduc gave information that
                        he saw her dead on the prairie in the year '50, a little before his sale of
                        his band of horses early in that year, and after he had spent some time in
                        looking for her in view of that sale. This was <emph>eleven</emph> years
                        after she had been purchased, and she having a colt every year—several of
                        which were also females—was there but one animal he obtained from that
                        mare?</p>
                     <p>Again, he speaks of cattle of his having been loaned to others, by him, on
                        shares. We are sure that Ruth never heard of such a circumstance, and we
                        believe that Mr. Durbin, who bought the band, will not assert that he
                        received any in that way. When Dr. Binney went to the United States in '42,
                        he entrusted his cows to the keeping of R. Williams, who was to receive a
                        part of the increase for his reward. When Dr. Binney returned, four only of
                        the increase was due Mr. W., which Dr. B. kept in exchange for property
                        given to Mr. W.; and again, if, as he states, that "<emph>the conduct of
                           complainant has been such as to render it impossible for defendant, with
                           any regard to his own peace and happiness, longer to continue to live
                           with her as man and wife,</emph>" why did he pray that the
                           <emph>bill</emph> might not be granted—and in <emph>what</emph> capacity
                        did he want her to live with him?</p>
                     <p>While Ruth lived in Linn City awaiting the action of the court, Dr. Binney
                        spent much of his time in Portland; and while she, as she wrote him, had not
                        and could not obtain even <emph>straw</emph> to sleep upon, desiring him to
                        permit her to have her feather bed she had brought from the States, he was
                        boarding at the best hotels, walking the streets with an Indian boy behind
                        him to carry his valise, and doing, in all things, exactly as <emph>such
                           gentlemen</emph> do. He joined the Free Masons and Sons of Temperance,
                        and at last requested Ruth to withdraw her petition and live with him again,
                        promising her to forever abstain from liquors—to treat her kindly—to pay all
                        expenses as yet incurred by her application to court, and to give her in
                        cash the first one thousand dollars he should earn by his practice. The
                        Judge having informed her of his expected absence to the States, and of the
                        probability that a hearing of her case could not be had for some time, in
                        consequence of the fact that there would be no judge to attend to it when
                           <emph>he</emph> should be away, she, considering that the prospect before
                        her of her husband's temperance was better than ever it had been, because of
                        his having publicly taken the "pledge," consented, and went with him to
                        Champoeg.</p>
                     <p>We have before us some curious extracts taken by W. J. Binney from letters
                        received by Thomas Binney, while in Portland, from his sisters, which, as
                        they devote the kind of minds which may sometimes be enclosed within silks,
                        jewelry, cotton, wool and whalebone, we insert them in the "Grains:"</p>

                     <p>ON settling at Champoeg, Ruth for the first day felt hope flickering around
                        her heart, like a flame around a substance which had been dipped in alcohol,
                        and, which, like it, departed as soon, leaving nothing but a scathed
                        impression. The <emph>second</emph> day there her husband returned to his
                        cups.</p>
                     <p>Many disagreeable occurrences transpired which we cannot stop to
                        delineate—we have only space to denote the most important.</p>
                     <p>On the occasion of the death of a friend, Dr. Shiels, Ruth went to Oregon
                        City to purchase mourning apparel for the widow, she being a cripple, and
                        Ruth's sympathies being much excited for her. (notwithstanding which she has
                           received<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC5702-00000093"/> but a poor return.)
                        She bore her own expenses, and returning next day found her husband would
                        not permit her to enter the house, accusing her of having been away for vile
                        purposes.</p>
                     <p>Ruth was obliged to find accommodations elsewhere, and the result was that
                        Dr. Binney sought her again and requested her to return and to induce her to

                                    are bound to render me. I cannot endure my husband's abuse! My
                                    health is daily sinking under it, and I ask the protection of
                                    the law, and a home, and support. You cannot urge in this
                                    application as you did in another I made, that you are unwilling
                                    to offend Dr. Binney. I now have made a complaint to you, and
                                    applied for assistance, and am ready to give my affidavit that
                                    my life is daily and almost hourly threatened by my husband; and
                                    I am much of the time disabled by his abuse, while I am as
                                    frequently ordered to leave the house I now occupy. I wish you
                                    to inform me by the bearer, in writing, if you refuse to afford
                                    me the assistance which is in your power.</p>

                     </q>
                     <p>This resulted in Dr. Binney's submitting to heavy bond that he would keep
                        the peace with his wife. And the three weeks following was, we have heard
                        Ruth say, the pleasantest period she ever passed with her husband.</p>
                     <p>She endeavored, in every possible way, by attentions, endearments,
                        kindnesses, praises and encouragements, to induce him to
                           <emph>continue</emph> in the good way he had again commenced.</p>
                     <p>At evening, when he had returned from his professional tours, he would show
                        the fee he had received to her, exclaiming:</p>
                     <p>"I can retrieve all my lost fortunes yet, if I can only let the d—d liquor
                        alone.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, she would reply, that is all that is wanting to enable you to become
                        respectable, successful and wealthy—and you <emph>will</emph> let liquor
                        alone <emph>won't</emph> you? I'm <emph>sure</emph> you have suffered enough
                        from its use!"</p>
                     <p>The spoiler came this time in the person of Barney Kanady. He had called on
                        the Sabbath and requested the doctor's presence at his house to visit a sick
                        woman, and when leaving went to the grocery and bought liquor to carry home
                        with him.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Binney did not return till several hours after the time when he might
                        have been at home from going so short a distance; but when he did come, he
                        came—alas! how fallen! How our heart bleeds while recurring to this part of
                        our story! Alas! alas! how fallen! The fresh pleasant countenance he bore
                        away with him, was now downcast and crimsoned with shame and guilt. He could
                        not look his wife in the face when he staggered into the house, trying with
                        smiles to remove the conviction that she might have received, while he
                        said:</p>
                     <p>"I'm quite a ladies' man! You see the ladies love me, Ruth, and they won't
                        let me alone."</p>
                     <p>"And I think you love the ladies," she replied, "if I am to judge by the
                        appearance of your coat," which being white linen, denoted very plainly some
                        such finger-marks as we think might be made by the hands of some dirty
                        Indian woman.</p>
                     <p>He looked at his shoulders and, in spite of his inebriation, manifested
                        confusion at the revelations they made.</p>
                     <p>'Twas over now! Hope had presented her last bait, and Ruth discarded it as a
                        phantasm not to be relied upon, and made up her mind to meet the realities
                        of her life, which seemed to be only bitterness and sorrow, with all the
                        fortitude God should give her.</p>
                     <p>She had, about a year before, set a day when she would leave her husband
                        finally, if there should appear no better prospect for her happiness with
                        him, or usefulness to him. She had told him of this, and many times
                           <emph>reminded</emph> him of this, her firm determination. But he seemed
                        not to fear, and now, as the time was approaching, he would tell her,
                        tauntingly, to "get ready, the time is near, and you have got to go then,
                        any how."</p>
                     <p>She made preparations slowly and sure. She packed her clothing and effects,
                        but had the mortification to have them frequently thrown out of her trunks,
                        to see, as her husband told her, if she had anything belonging to him.</p>
                     <p>The talked of morning at last came. Dr. Binney apprized her of it, and said
                        he wanted her now "to go, as she had so long talked about it, and to hurry
                        and be off, but not a d—d article was he going to permit her to take with
                        her, not even an old stocking; and if any person came to the house to assist
                        her to take any thing away from it, he would shoot them dead at the
                        door!"</p>
                     <p>Ruth told him that he had expressed a wish for her to go, and she intended
                        so to do, but she wanted a change of apparel, and could not be comfortable
                        without it. He said she might "take <emph>one</emph> trunk of clothes, and
                        that was every d—d thing she should have."</p>
                     <p>She went away resignedly, believing the court would allow her to obtain
                        them.</p>
                     <p>She had purchased, when in New York, about three hundred dollars worth of
                        millinery articles, with her own funds. The most of these she left. And
                        about three months before leaving her house she had bought, also with her
                        own money, ninety-four dollars worth of household furniture, which was also
                        remaining.</p>
                     <p>In a few days Dr. Binney wrote her to this effect:</p>

                     <p>Ruth <emph>did</emph> feel reluctance in going, and so informed him, and
                        also said if there was anything saved which he felt disposed to allow her to
                        receive, he could place it in a person's hands whom she designated—but no
                        such act did he perform.</p>
                     <p>By this fire Ruth lost, according to an<pb n="186-187"
                           xml:id="VAC5702-00000094"/> estimate before us, to the amount of about
                        nine hundred and twenty dollars, entirely of her own purchasing and the
                        gifts of friends—without any reference to her share of the other property
                        thus destroyed.</p>
                     <p>She awaited the term of the court which was to be held in Salem in the month
                        of October following.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Binney many times endeavored to induce her to return, but to no effect.
                        He made another effort to be free from the ruinous consequences of
                        intemperance, by resolving, as he thought <emph>firmly</emph>; that he would
                        drink no more; and he said he wished people would not ask him to drink, for
                        he believed if they would not he could keep clear.</p>
                     <p>O! ye enticers to evil! we wish the punishment due your errors might fall
                        upon you <emph>now</emph>, and restrain you hereafter from spreading any
                        more snares for the feet of the unwary.</p>
                     <p>As soon as Dr. Binney returned to Champoeg he was enticed to drink at Mr.
                        Steven's tavern, and many a dollar did he spend at his bar before he again
                        obtained resolution to free himself from the company he met there.</p>
                     <p>Ruth's second petition to court was similar to the first, with the
                        additional mention of some indignities she had suffered from her husband at
                        Champoeg, and was prepared by A. Holbrook, Esq., of Oregon City, in a very
                        able, clear and feeling manner. She awaited its action during the week, her
                        case being in chancery and the last on the docket.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Holbrook, her attorney, did not attend court, which greatly excited her
                        regrets; but through two other excellent gentlemen, who seemed to possess
                        authority to attend to his business in his absence: she endeavored, if her
                        case could not be attended to at that term of court, that there might be
                        some provision made for her support during the period she was waiting its
                        decision.</p>
                     <p>The law had allowed but one week for this term of court, and Saturday noon
                        came and Ruth's petition had not been considered.</p>
                     <p>It was in vain she suggested, through the gentlemen referred to, that her
                        wardrobe had been almost totally destroyed by fire, and that her health was
                        poor, and that winter approaching she needed clothing and means to pay her
                        board—she could get no hearing or action on the subject.</p>
                     <p>And herein we may see the difference between the two Judges. She asked if
                        she might receive an order to obtain her piano and a trunk of a few articles
                        of hers which Dr. Binney still had in his possession, and was informed that
                        these she could do without till the next term of court, and as there had
                        been no decision made in her case neither these articles nor money could be
                        obtained.</p>
                     <p>The Judge afterwards informed her that having but one half day not required
                        for other business, if her petition for a bill had required only a mere form
                        of proceeding she could have been heard, but perceiving that her application
                        would be contested there was not time to attend to it.</p>
                     <p>This was undoubtedly right. We confess that we are ignorant of law in such
                        cases, but we wonder, if Judge Pratt could make the provision he did for
                        Ruth's support, aside from the immediate action of the court, why another
                        Judge could not have done the same under the same circumstances.</p>
                     <p>Ruth waited till April following, and obtained a bill of divorce in the
                        following terms:</p>
                     <p>"RUTH BINNEY, <abbr>vs.</abbr> W. J. BINNEY. <hi rend="i"/>Bill for
                        Divorce.</p>
                     <p>"This cause coming on to be heard, upon the pleadings and evidence of the
                        parties, the court finds that the allegations of adultery and gross and
                        habitual drunkenness, made in plaintiff's petition against defendant, are
                        not supported by evidence, but that the charge of harsh and cruel treatment
                        is to some extent sustained, and that the welfare of the parties require
                        separation.</p>
                     <p>"It is therefore ordered and adjudged that the bonds of matrimony now
                        existing between the said Ruth and William J., be and are hereafter held for
                        naught.</p>
                     <p>"It is further ordered that the said Ruth have the exclusive property in,
                        and possession to all monies, evidence of indebtedness, and personal
                        effects, of every description, now in her hands, or which have been
                        deposited by her, or for her use, or of which she has heretofore had the
                        sole control.</p>
                     <p>"That she have the piano and her clothing now in the possession of the said
                        W. J., as her own property, to be delivered to her by the said William
                        J.</p>
                     <p>"That the said W. J. pay the said Ruth the sum of one hundred dollars, and
                        also the costs of this suit, and that execution issue therefore.</p>
                     <p>"It is further ordered that the said William J. have all the residue of his
                        property, of every kind and description, free from any charge or claim of
                        the said Ruth, or to which she might be entitled in law if this divorce had
                        not been granted."</p>
                     <p>At this trial not one allegation was presented against Ruth. One or two
                        witnesses said they had heard her speak angrily, and as would have been
                        severely, if she had received no provocation.</p>
                     <p>Aside from this, with all her husband's cruel accusations and reproaches,
                        her conduct as a wife had been irreproachable.</p>
                     <p>As to the remark that the "allegations of adultery and gross and habitual
                        drunkenness not being supported by evidence," we will say that Ruth had
                        asked her attorney how <emph>little</emph> of the accusations against her
                        husband it would be necessary to prove in order to obtain a bill, as
                           <emph>it</emph> was all her <choice>
                           <sic>objest</sic>
                           <corr>object</corr>
                        </choice>—she having no wish to present any proof against him which was
                        unnecessary, it being not her object to do him injury but to benefit her own
                        situation.</p>
                     <p>She was told that any one of the allegations being sustained by proof, was
                        sufficient to enable her to obtain a bill, and her instructions on the
                        subject of testimony required ran to this effect:</p>
                     <p>1st. "Testimony to show habitual and gross drunkenness.</p>
                     <p>2d. "Harsh and cruel treatment and personal indignities, rendering life
                        burdensome."</p>
                     <p>In seeking testimony Ruth made <emph>not one</emph> attempt to prove
                        licentiousness, and at the time of the trial she suggested a question to her
                        attorney which would have referred to the subject, but he declined putting
                        it to the witness, saying: "The court would not like to hear it."</p>
                     <p>On the subject of drunkenness she had only sought <emph>one</emph> witness,
                        as she happened to be in her vicinity, but she being unable to attend she
                        made no farther attempt to obtain testimony on this subject.</p>
                     <p>At the close of the trial Dr. Binney remarked that he was "glad he had got
                        off without his character being injured!"</p>
                     <p>On the subject of alimony the law reads thus:</p>
                     <p>"In granting a divorce the court shall also make such disposition of the
                        property of the parties as shall appear just and equitable, having regard to
                        the respective merits of the parties, and to the condition which they will
                        be left by such divorce, and to the party through whom the property was
                        acquired and to the burdens imposed upon it for the benefit of children, and
                        all property and pecuniary rights and interests * * * * not otherwise
                        disposed of or regulated by the order of the court, shall by said divorce be
                        divested out of the guilty party at whose instance the divorce was
                        granted."</p>
                     <p>Ruth's petition on this subject ran thus:</p>
                     <p>"And also that your honor will enquire as to the amount of his property, and
                        how it has been acquired and preserved, and make such order as alimony, and
                        her support, and legal expenses during the progress of this cause, as may be
                        just and equitable. And that your honor will grant such other and further
                        relief as may seem fit and proper."</p>
                     <p>We believe not one question was put to any witness by the court as to what
                        extent Mrs. Binney had been influential in acquiring and preserving the
                        property of Dr. Binney. Some questions as to the amount he then had in his
                        possession, were put, and evasively and unjustly answered in nearly every
                        case by his witnesses. Testimony abundant on these<pb n="188-189"
                           xml:id="VAC5702-00000095"/> subjects could have been obtained and would
                        have been procured, if any suspicion had been entertained that the decision
                        of the Judge would have been what it was—but Ruth never having been—at court
                        before, and knowing nothing of its manner of proceeding, trusted that
                        justice would be awarded her, and this was all she wished. At the time of
                        this decree, Dr. Binney possessed a dwelling house and eight lots at
                        Champoeg—one dwelling house and four lots at <choice>
                           <sic>Buteville</sic>
                           <corr>Butteville</corr>
                        </choice> which were not confirmed to Ruth—four fine horses, fourteen cows
                        and calves, (he had told Mrs. M. a few days before court that he had that
                        number engaged and was to receive them in a few days,) a stock of goods in
                        Allan &amp; McKinlay's store, at Oregon City, and about three thousand
                        dollars or upwards in the hands of Dr. McLaughlin at Oregon City, (this Ruth
                        knew him to have there when she left home, and there had not been any
                        withdrawn to her knowledge,) probably three or four thousand in debts and
                        his household furniture, medicines, cash on hand, and besides a good
                        profession which was a fortune in itself, and health and strength.</p>
                     <p>It had been shown in court that Ruth had on interest in the States one
                        thousand dollars. She had borne her own expenses since her separation from
                        her husband, much of the time paying seven and eight dollars per week for
                        her board. On leaving the States the last time, Dr. Binney had, to induce
                        her to come with him, made a will entirely in her own favor, and in many
                        other ways denoted his wish toward her relative to property. There are some
                        of the facts in the case; <emph>all</emph> of which however were not made
                        apparent in court.</p>
                     <p>Considering these things, was there any justice in the decision which
                        decreed that she should retain what was in her possession, and receive
                           <emph>one hundred dollars to pay her counsel?</emph> If this be justice,
                        what is wrong?</p>
                     <p>We were told that the reason of the Judge making this decision was because
                        he perceived that Dr. Binney had more friends in court than Mrs. Binney, and
                        that he was in ill humor. Ruth had not known that friends would produce an
                        influence in a court of equity. Had she known this she could have produced
                        some more—but there would have been a difficulty here which Dr. Binney did
                        not meet. <emph>Her</emph> friends were mostly females, and in several
                        instances, wives of Dr. Binney's witnesses who did Ruth the greatest injury
                        by presenting false testimony;—for instance one of her greatest friends was
                        Mrs. Cosgrove, wife of Hugh Cosgrove, and another was Mrs. Demick, wife of
                        Mr. Demick. The husbands of these being opposed to Mrs. Binney, would not
                        have suffered them to appear as her friends; and women cannot travel about
                        the country as readily as men.</p>
                     <p>We have a few more remarks to make on the testimony of witnesses.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Cosgrove testified on oath that he did not know whether Dr. Binney owned
                        a cow or not, which we are certain was false—for 'tis impossible that he had
                        forgotten that Dr. Binney and his wife had at different times inquired of
                        him relative to stray cows and calves, and also he has seen cows in the
                        yard, and Mrs. Binney milking them, and has expressed his opinions of their
                        good qualities, and cost, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>He also stated that he never saw Dr. Binney intoxicated! Did he never
                           <emph>make</emph> him so, when he has gone to his grocery a sober man,
                        and left it with scarcely ability to get home? Was he not in that state when
                        he passed the night in revellings with him at McKoy's mill; and when in that
                        condition took the gift of a valuable horse, which he afterwards sold for
                        one hundred dollars. But 'tis said, "the fly that feeds on d—g is colored
                        thereby." 'Tis probable that being so much that way himself, he could not
                        distinguish the difference between sobriety and drunkenness.</p>
                     <p>We think it not strange that when giving testimony he stood all the time
                        with his hand over his mouth, to prevent his confusion from becoming
                        apparent. Robert Newell also testified that he could not say that he ever
                        saw Dr. Binney intoxicated. The same reasons blinded his eyes as in the case
                        of Cosgrove, especially at the time that he enticed him to drink at J.
                        Hord's, and remained drinking with him till Sabbath morning. He also
                        testified tified that he would not be willing to give twenty-five hundred
                        dollars for all Dr. Binney possessed. This he might have said
                        conscientiously—for likely he did not wish to buy. George Aplim also said he
                        could not say he ever saw Dr. Binney intoxicated. What ailed him when having
                        gone to his house to see his wife, and he had sent to Champoeg for liquor—he
                        being unable to return, tarried all night, and caused him to say to Mr.
                        Gearing—"Dr. Binney did not do anything for my wife—he was in such a state
                        he was not capable of attending to his business!"</p>
                     <p>This latter person had been much of his time at Dr. Binney's house in poor
                        health, and had been waited upon by Mrs. Binney in the best manner she was
                        able. He afterwards rewarded her by bringing liquor privately to her
                        husband, and thus exciting disturbances in her house.</p>
                     <p>When Mrs. Binney arrived at the Butte from the States the second time, she
                        related to Mrs. Demick the reasons which had induced her to return to
                        Oregon, and among others, said that Dr. Binney had left her suddenly in
                        Massachusetts, and before she had learned where he was he had expended about
                        seven thousand dollars in goods in New York to come to Oregon. This
                        statement she also had made in a letter to a lady at Butteville.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Demick testified on oath that being at Butteville at the time referred
                        to—and in another room, in conversation with another person—he heard Mrs.
                        Binney say that when she left to come to Oregon, she had <emph>about seven
                           thousand dollars in a bank in New York</emph>. This was entirely a
                        misunderstanding, and Mr. Demick's unwillingness to be convinced arose most
                        probably from the fact of his being a Universalist, and having no fear of
                        perjury, and from the smart he felt in losing a valuable cow after having
                        broken his contract with Mrs. Binney in taking her from her, the consequence
                        of which was the loss to him of eighty or ninety dollars.</p>
                     <p>Before the time of court Mrs. Binney went with Mrs. Stanton of the Marion
                        Hotel, Salem, to call on Mrs. Pentor of Salem, and Mrs. Binney asked in Mrs.
                        Stanton's presence if she remembered the circumstance of Dr. Binney having
                        struck his wife in the face.</p>
                     <p>"O, yes, perfectly."</p>
                     <p>"Did you see him give the blow?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes."</p>
                     <p>"Did you notice the conversation?"</p>
                     <p>"I heard you talking, but I could not tell what you said—I was very sick at
                        the time."</p>
                     <p>"Did you hear Mrs. Binney say anything out of the way? I want you to try and
                        think, and don't be afraid to say so if you did."</p>
                     <p>"Well, I <emph>did'nt</emph> hear her say anything that was ugly at all—but
                        I know I thought at the time that Dr. Binney was mighty provoking in the way
                           <emph>he</emph> acted."</p>
                     <p>This person afterwards at court testified that at the period named, she
                        heard Mrs. Binney speak <emph>harshly</emph> to Dr. Binney. We are unwilling
                        to suppose that Mrs. Pentor would take a false oath if she understood the
                        responsibility—but we have reason to suppose that she might have been
                        influenced to testify thus by her husband who was always irritated against
                        Mrs. Binney because she would not receive his children into her house when
                        his sick wife came there under her care.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Binney's counsel were quite tame on the subject of the divorce—but on
                        that of <emph>alimony</emph> they were deeply interested. We were not
                        surprised at this as in one case there were two old maids and a fortune in
                        the scales, and in the other case, "<emph>money! money!!</emph>" seemed to
                        be the only subject on which the man could muster any ideas. They both tried
                        to make it appear that the five thousand dollars spoken of had not been
                        received again by Dr. Binney.</p>
                     <p>The reader will perceive that Dr. Binney in his first answer says:—"and of
                        which I afterwards with much difficulty obtained possession."</p>
                     <p>When Ruth returned home after learning the decision of the court—she opened
                        her bible to refresh her mind, and was much surprised to find the first
                        passage read as follows:—"<emph>Thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of
                           trembling and wrung then out.</emph>"</p>

                  <head>THE MONSTER.</head>
                  <p>BUT <emph>two</emph> have responded to our challenge, viz: "Quintus" and
                     "Squills," both in the <title>Oregonian.</title>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first we leave to wallow on in the mire of his choice. "<foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">Il ne faut jamais defier un fou.</foreign>"</p>
                  <p>The second we will notice. Having forwarded a copy of the "Grains" to the
                     editor, he acknowledged its receipt in the following language:</p>
                  <p>* * * * * "We seldom read books of feminine production, believing
                        <emph>their</emph> (the females) province to be darning stockings, pap and
                     gruel, children, cook-stoves, and the sundry little affairs that make life
                     comfortable and makes them what Providence designed them to be
                        <emph>Helpmeets.</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"It is bad enough to have unjust laws, &amp;c., without this last visitation of
                     Providence—an authoress." "In the words of Homer (or his translator) we say,
                     'and may this first invasion be the last.'"</p>
                  <p>From these remarks it appears this editor wants a helpmeet in the affairs named
                     above—and we conclude if a young lady who died in Portland, a few years ago,
                     had lived, he would have found one.</p>
                  <p>Again. Does he consider the first number of the "Grains" to be a "visitation of
                     Providence?" If so, no wonder he wishes no more such.</p>
                  <p>We did not compile the 'Grains' for the special information of "Squills," and
                     we advise him to lay the book aside and read "Homer" till he shall be able to
                     perceive the difference between him and his translator.</p>
                  <p>And now then Mr. Monster Evil stand forth! but not on the boggy ground of the
                        <title>Spectator</title>, nor on the slimy soil of the
                        <title>Oregonian</title>, but on fair ground, and let the world be
                     witnesses. Harness on your scales of scurrility, and in your right hand take
                     the spear of a corrupted press, and prepare for combat; and, if you must take a
                     stomachic, don't take squills, for they are very nauseating in their effect, if
                     given in large doses. Come on to the combat, and, with the help of Omnipotence,
                     we defy you!</p>
                  <p>For the benefit of our readers who may think to subscribe for the
                        <title>Oregonian</title>, we will say that we have seen <emph>one</emph>
                     clean number of that periodical. It made its appearance in the month of August,
                     1854, when the editor was on the top of Mount Hood, and we think if he would
                     always stay there the <title>Oregonian</title> would take a respectable
                     position among its <choice>
                        <sic>cotemporaries</sic>
                        <corr>contemporaries</corr>
                     </choice>.</p>
                  <p>OUR REASONS FOR THIS PUBLICATION.—We think our readers have perceived them, and
                     we will only conclude that we consider the expenditure of millions, if
                     necessary, none too much to remove the foul aspersions cast upon a helpless
                     female by her enemies.</p>
                  <p>OUR NEXT NUMBER, if published, will contain "Passages in the life of Ruth
                     Rover," continued, and "Pictures of Oregon," illustrative of life and the state
                     of society in Oregon since 1837 till the present day.</p>
