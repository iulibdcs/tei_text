CHAPTER I.&#xD;
A -BRASIER OF CHARCOAL.&#xD;
It was a brown-stone house, situated at the&#xD;
corner of a fashionable avenue, in' the city of&#xD;
New York.    The brown-stone house had&#xD;
brown-stone neighbors, but none more grand&#xD;
and imposing. It was surrounded by an'ele-&#xD;
gant iron fence, inclosing a neht margin of&#xD;
greensward. The brown-stone house, was&#xD;
not social in its outer aspect ; but it was aris-&#xD;
tocratic, and its master did not cai e to have'&#xD;
it otherwise. .Stephen Parkhurst was its&#xD;
master. Stephen Parkhurst:was fifty years&#xD;
of age. In everything pertaining to his char-&#xD;
acter, Stephen Parkhurst was a remarkable.&#xD;
man. His mental attributes were not of the&#xD;
common order. He was a gentleman of iron&#xD;
firmness of purpose. His sagacity equaled&#xD;
his resolution. He was coldly courteous, but&#xD;
not affable. -'He possessed a singular. faculty&#xD;
of penetrating the designs of those who ap-&#xD;
proached him. This intuitive power seemed&#xD;
in Stephen Parkhurst something more than&#xD;
mere accident-it was a subtle instinct.&#xD;
His forehead was broad and overhung his&#xD;
eyes, which were -deep-set and glowed like&#xD;
dark yet animated opals. - Thought, burned&#xD;
perpetually in those penetrating balls. His&#xD;
nose was long and straight. His mouth wit&#xD;
wide, and somewhat depressed at the cor-&#xD;
-ners. His cheeks,.like his brow, were furrow-&#xD;
ed with care.' The .handwriting of Time&#xD;
gave a severe but not disagreeable expression&#xD;
to his face. He had iron-gray hair. He Wore&#xD;
no beard. He was of medium height ; his&#xD;
figure erect, and his step firm and assured.&#xD;
Stephen Parkhurst was a man eminently&#xD;
fitted to take care Tof himself. No matter&#xD;
how the 'world might goi; no matter what&#xD;
kind of people came to him-; no matter what&#xD;
traps were laid for his feet ; no matter what&#xD;
hypocrisy surrounded him; no matter what&#xD;
danger dogged him-he could take care of&#xD;
&#xD;
,himelf. To take care of one's self is a great&#xD;
thing.. Stephen Parkhurst was strong, and&#xD;
had power to protect the weak.&#xD;
Stephen Parkhurst reigned alone: in his&#xD;
brown-stone house. There was- no one in&#xD;
the brown-stone house to dispute\ his sover&#xD;
eign wishes. Mrs. Stephen Parkhurst had&#xD;
left the brown-stone house for a. very narrow&#xD;
and silent house a few feet under ground.&#xD;
But Stephen's life followed on, and the -do-&#xD;
mestic routine did not stop.&#xD;
It was.a September evening. No matter&#xD;
what- year it was-all time is the same in&#xD;
story-but it was not long ago. Stephen&#xD;
Parkhurst was at home and had a visitor.&#xD;
Had there been no visitor, thisstrange record&#xD;
would not have dated from that night. This&#xD;
visitor was a man near Stephen's 'own age,&#xD;
but much unlike him in person and char-&#xD;
acter. He was taller, thinner, and less erect&#xD;
and manly in his bearing. His eyes went&#xD;
down when they should have gone, up into&#xD;
one's face, and went up stealthily when they&#xD;
should lave been elsewhere. His, hair was&#xD;
gray-perbaps with age, perhaps with suffer-&#xD;
ing, perhaps with protligacy. His expression&#xD;
was reticent and brooding. He had evident-&#xD;
ly succumbed to many things which he&#xD;
should have conquered;- and his ideas of&#xD;
human, brotherhood were considerably con-&#xD;
fused. There were spectral shapes flitting&#xD;
about his conscience. Scanninghin closely,&#xD;
one would say that he was disposed to mis-&#xD;
anthropy, and that there was a well of bitter-&#xD;
ness within him that no moral pump could&#xD;
draw dry. In his dress he was not quite.&#xD;
:tidy, and he was perceptibly worn and&#xD;
threadbare.p                 w&#xD;
. This was Richard Parkhurst, half-brother&#xD;
to Stephen. The relationship was in blood&#xD;
andI not in sentiment.&#xD;

journey. He sat in an easy-chair casting&#xD;

&#xD;
Stephen Parkhurst arose, and the seivant&#xD;
wheeled his large chair toward, the brasier.&#xD;
He resented himself, smiled blandly upon&#xD;
Richard, leaned forward, and held his hands&#xD;
over the pan. The- coals glowed, and shot&#xD;
little globes of fire at him. The heat fumed&#xD;
up against his chilled fingers and blue lips.&#xD;
he servant quietly' threw a cloak over&#xD;
his shoulders, and gave him the hot brandy&#xD;
and-water. He accepted the glass, and, hold-&#xD;
ing it untasted, looked dreamily at Richard.&#xD;
" You have not inquired about my old&#xD;
friend, Nornian," he said.  *&#xD;
"No. I have been thinking of you, and&#xD;
not of your foster-brother. Remember, Sir,&#xD;
that I have not known him intimately, And&#xD;
never loved him. You were always fond of&#xD;
him; and some uncharitable persons fancied&#xD;
that the resemblance between you was rather&#xD;
too strong to be purely coincidental. But&#xD;
that is nothing. Slander is natural to .man.&#xD;
There are people in the world who would&#xD;
die if'they couldn't talk about their neigh-&#xD;
bors. 'The world is such a hypocrite that I&#xD;
hate it: It rails at the best of us. I have&#xD;
known it to wag its tongue at you. It has&#xD;
ca"Unkind world!" said Stephen, calmly.&#xD;
"How fares this Norman?" asked Richard,&#xD;
glancing at the brasier.   u&#xD;
"Well. Very well. I -doubt whether he&#xD;
be not happier than either of us."&#xD;
He spoke carelessly, and sipped from the&#xD;
glass.&#xD;
" He has always experienced your charity,&#xD;
I believe," observed' Richard, with a less&#xD;
friendly expression..&#xD;
"On my journey to .see my daughter, I&#xD;
passed a night with him in his humble home.&#xD;
The interview awakened memories that long&#xD;
have slept. I softened toward Norman Drew.&#xD;
I'shall bury all his infirmities."'&#xD;
Stephen Parkhurst sighed, and fell into&#xD;
abstraction.&#xD;
"It is better to forgive than to bear malice,"&#xD;
replied Richard, with humility.&#xD;
"1Benefactions are better than curses," said&#xD;
" 'Stephen, nodding at the brasier in a musing&#xD;
manner.' "Curses are the froth and spume of&#xD;
anger.. I am making some final arrangements&#xD;
concerning Norman Drew."&#xD;
-"You can well afford to be charitable,"&#xD;
answered Richard, uneasily. " But you are&#xD;
beginning.to-be comfortable,,and'I will leave&#xD;
you. Can I do anything more for you ?"&#xD;
He kept his eyes fixed upon the glass,&#xD;
which Stephen had not entirely drained ol&#xD;
its contents,.&#xD;
"No," responded Stephei,'impressively\;&#xD;
" yu can do nothing more for me!"&#xD;
He paused ; then, raising himself'-in' his&#xD;
chair and turning his grave face upon his&#xD;
half-brother, asked.&#xD;
&#xD;
'ii&#xD;
&#xD;
" What is your business with me?"'&#xD;
- Not quite prepared for this question, Rich-&#xD;
ard Parkhurst hesitated, and was perceptibly&#xD;
embarrassed.&#xD;
" I believe," added Stephen, coldly," that&#xD;
you never call on,me for, naught ? Is there&#xD;
not some trifling matter that you .came to-see&#xD;
about'?"&#xD;
He held Richard firmly under his eyes,&#xD;
and seemed to look him through with his un-&#xD;
wavering glances.&#xD;
"Nothing," said Richard, "that will not&#xD;
keep till morning.. Pardon me for obtrud-&#xD;
in . You keow that I seldom trouble you."&#xD;
A bitter sneer flickered on the pale lips of&#xD;
Stephen Parkhurst.&#xD;
" I knew not,'"', he responde,,' "lut that you&#xD;
had reached the end of wit, and'had come to&#xD;
me in default of it.' Your ways are bad,&#xD;
Richard. They are more than bad, Richard.&#xD;
They are abominable! Do not suppose' that&#xD;
I have lost sight of you because I'do not&#xD;
often see  ou.  The path of' your life is&#xD;
crooked. ices and devices must have an&#xD;
end at last. Cards and cunning prosper not&#xD;
always. Beggary and burglary follow such&#xD;
beginnings. "Will.you never mend, Rich-&#xD;
ard?"'&#xD;
" You are severe, Sir,"'answered Richard,&#xD;
assuming 4n air of profound humility. "Se-&#xD;
vere, but not utterly unjust. With God's&#xD;
help, I hope. to begin a new life, Stephen."&#xD;
He drew a tattered handerchief from his coat-&#xD;
pocket and wiped his'-eyes. " I have, already&#xD;
begun a new life,"&#xD;
1Weep moderately, Richard, weep moder-&#xD;
ately !" returned Stephen, sarcastically. "Vio-&#xD;
lent emotion may injure you! However, let&#xD;
this pass. , We have not much in common.&#xD;
You live in the world, and I live in it ; and&#xD;
that is about all that can. be said of us. You&#xD;
can hope little from. me. I am not a gener-&#xD;
ous man. I never .learned to be heroic.&#xD;
Nearness of blood makes not nearness of feel-&#xD;
ing. The man that I love, is my relative ;&#xD;
and no other is akin to me. Being 'born of&#xD;
my mother makes no brother for me, unless&#xD;
the thought be brotherly. A sister is a. sis-&#xD;
ter, if her acts, be sisterly. I offer you no&#xD;
money, because the world is all before op,&#xD;
and -you can wrmg money',out of it. You&#xD;
have- a great. capital, Richard, to work upon.&#xD;
You have-craft, cunning, duplicity, chicanery,&#xD;
device, wile, trick,.and finesse for your capi-&#xD;
- tal. With these you hq4  pw rich. But&#xD;
you look not rich, Richard'l&#xD;
I am not rich !" muttered Richard. "But&#xD;

the hisses of an enemy. You cannot re-&#xD;

But I will turn his deceased to good accotilt."&#xD;
He took a long narrow strip of paper from&#xD;
his pocket. It Was a telegram, announcing&#xD;
the sudden, death,' at a station-house, not far,&#xD;
from the city, of one Norman Drew, who,&#xD;
while dying, had requested' that his body5&#xD;
should be forwarded to-Stephen Parkhurst for&#xD;

Magnus Drake was Stephen Parkhurst's&#xD;
legal. adviser, a very "shirewd, and ,reliable&#xD;
gentleman.  Magnus Drake carried perse-&#xD;
verance, faithfulness, and industry into -his&#xD;
business. He was cautious, and as earnest&#xD;
as he was cautious. Hewas adroit, and'hon-&#xD;
est as he',swas, adroit. He could be trusteid,&#xD;
both in' the-great and small affairs of 'life. If&#xD;
he was cunting, it was-for his client-; if he&#xD;
was subtle, it was for the truth. Tothisintan&#xD;
the thoughts of Parkhurst turned.&#xD;
"Shall I send ?" he queried. "There is no'&#xD;
one to'sehd. John has been tampered with ;&#xD;

a villain. I cannot 'eend John. I must go&#xD;

but the child has courage. The streets are&#xD;
still full, and no ne will harm her. a&#xD;
Just then there was a light knock at, the&#xD;
door.&#xD;

He arose, unlocked and opened the door,&#xD;
calmly and quie'ily. A.'young girl entered,&#xD;
timidly. Her eyes beamed, her-cheeks low-&#xD;

"Always fertile in thought," responded the&#xD;

lightened Drake's burden. :They bore. it to&#xD;

flight of stone steps. They went down the&#xD;
steps with the box, end, depositing it in a&#xD;
.convenient place,. filled it with straw .and&#xD;

the cover loosely upon it, with the direction,&#xD;

CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
THE LIsTENER.&#xD;
Stephen' Parkhurst had arranged the inter-&#xD;
ior of his house agreeably to hisown ideas&#xD;
of convenience. '1he compartments devoted&#xD;
specially to himself were'upon the first floor ;&#xD;
and comprised' a sleeping-room, private re-&#xD;
ception-room, a small ante-room, and a li-&#xD;
brary. These were separated by halls, not as&#xD;
wide as the main hall, but sufficiently ample&#xD;
to suit the proprietor's notions of comfort.&#xD;
For the sake of quiet, these exclusive apart-&#xD;
ments did not front upon the 'avenue, but&#xD;
were situated mn the rear corner of the house ,&#xD;
two of.them looking- out upon a cross-street,&#xD;
connecting the fashionable avenue with a less&#xD;
noted one running parallel with it. The side-&#xD;
door, by which Parkhurst had, received the,&#xD;
mortality-of Norman Drew, opened *pon this&#xD;
transverse street in an :unpretentious way,&#xD;
with a narrow stip of green and the iron&#xD;
fence .between,'with its guarding but ever-&#xD;
lockedgate. This gate had been left unlock-&#xD;
ed on the night to which attention has - been&#xD;
drawn. The room, in which the foregoing&#xD;
scenes transpired, was Stephen's sleeping-&#xD;
apartment, and was in the southwest cor-&#xD;
ner of the brown-stone house. East of it&#xD;
was the library,,and directly between these&#xD;
two and the main hall were the ante-room&#xD;
and the reception-room.&#xD;
When Parkhurst closed the door upon&#xD;
Sibylla Joy, she was left standing in the hall,&#xD;
between his reception-room and his sleeping-1&#xD;
apartment. There was no light there, save&#xD;
what crept in from the, main hall, where a&#xD;
single burner had been left burning.&#xD;

,Sybilla liad' curiosity, but it was not of-s&#xD;
malicious and obtruding character. She we&#xD;
above the meanness of .eavesdropping. She&#xD;
would have shrunk with repugnance from&#xD;
taking a- single step to steal the confidential&#xD;
words of another ; but while she stood there&#xD;
in the obscurity, she had troubled and anx-&#xD;
ious thoughts concerning Stephen Parkhurst,&#xD;
which inspired her with an inquisitiveness&#xD;
far different fromhmousing curiosity andncom-&#xD;
mon cunning. She had noticed, closely, the&#xD;
deportment ofher guardian, and all that was&#xD;
prophetic in herpure young soul assured-her&#xD;
that matters were not flowing in their accus-&#xD;
tomed channel, and that something out of the&#xD;
ordinary cdurse- was about to happen. His&#xD;
seriousness, his impenetrability, and  the&#xD;
sending for .Magnus Drake at such an hour&#xD;
with the observance of so much secrecy,&#xD;
awakened startling suspicions. Had Stephen&#xD;
Parkhurst become disgusted with the world?&#xD;
Had he seen enough of life -and was he pre-&#xD;
paring to look at the other side of the pic-&#xD;
ture,? It was possible.  uch frightful things.&#xD;
often happened. Peraps her generous pro-&#xD;
tector was not beyond temptation. Tempta'&#xD;
tion is liable to take the best of persons and&#xD;
conquer them.   urmi7seslike these disturbed&#xD;
Sibylla and shaped her actions. She felt an ir-&#xD;
repressible desire to listen, and watch in some&#xD;
manner the conduct of Stephen Parkhurst.&#xD;
She knew that it was mean'to listen ; that it&#xD;
was mean to watch-; but she loved him who&#xD;
had given her home and happiness ; and her&#xD;
love held her spellbound near the door. She&#xD;
sat down upon the floor, or rather knelt upon&#xD;
one knee, and leaned her head against the&#xD;
door. She heard Parkhurst's voice; but it&#xD;
was low and the words were indistinguish-&#xD;
able. Magnus Drake said. but little. - Now&#xD;
and then he made a brief reply, but his utter-&#xD;
ances were also indistinct. She remained&#xD;
motionless till her limbs ached, but was no&#xD;
wiser for her pains. Magnus went out after&#xD;
a time. The going out was evident enough.&#xD;
She did not think he would come back ; but&#xD;
by and by he returned. What surprised her&#xD;
most was that he did not come alone; she&#xD;
judged by the shuffling of feet that at least&#xD;
two persons were with him. That mystified&#xD;
her ; nor did the mystery grow less as the mo-&#xD;
ments went on. Those who entered with&#xD;
Maghlus departed ; her hearing told her that.&#xD;
. Why did they move softly in Stephen's&#xD;
room? Why did they speak in suppressed&#xD;
voices or in whispers           .&#xD;
Anew sound reached her attentive ears.&#xD;
It was a crepitating, rending noise, like draw-&#xD;
lmg nails ekutiously, or prying against some-&#xD;
thin&amp;amp;-that offered strong resistance, and yielc-&#xD;
ed with creakings and complainings. Sibyll&amp;amp;'s&#xD;
heart beat strangely. She endeavored to Jok&#xD;
through the k    le; but the key standing&#xD;
&#xD;
verticalifr in the lock, filled it and backed her&#xD;
curiosity. She arose, and glided along- the&#xD;
hall Jill she reached the next;.which ranat&#xD;
right angles to it, into jhe main hall in one&#xD;
direction, and, to the- side-door in the other.&#xD;
She paused at 'the corner of. the mysterious&#xD;
room. It was well 'that. she stopped .there,&#xD;
for tine side-door of Stephen's room opened,&#xD;
almost immediately. ; She shrank back out of&#xD;
sight. Parkhurst and, Drake were carrying&#xD;
the box to the wine-vault. Sybilla was s8&#xD;
timid and so inuch agitated that.she did not&#xD;
lobk after them, and they passed 'through the&#xD;
ball-door unseen by leer. Herheart fluttered,&#xD;
her lips trembled, and her respiration was&#xD;
painfully -quickened. 'She wished to glance&#xD;
into that apartment ; one hurried-Cast of the&#xD;
eye would be enough. The opportunity was&#xD;
favorable; it asked but afirm foot and pur-&#xD;
pose. She was turning to obey this impulse,&#xD;
when she observed that more light suddenly&#xD;
streamed in the main hall. She instantly re-&#xD;
membered that Stephen Parkhurst had spoken&#xD;
of secrecy. .,He had certainly manifested a&#xD;
-stron desire to be free from interruption, She&#xD;
considered it her duty to guard him from in-&#xD;
trusion, whateverhe was doing. Would he do&#xD;
wrong? Her love said" No". Standing a&#xD;
little back, and gathering her skirts closely&#xD;
about her, she kept watch of the passage, and&#xD;
soon heard the creaking of shoes ; a very&#xD;
slio'ht and suppressed creaking. ' A face pres-&#xD;
ent y pushed into view ; a stealthy and anx-&#xD;
ious face ; a face that had - expectation and&#xD;
terror in it; a face that had guilt in it. Sibyl-&#xD;
la recognized those features at once. It was&#xD;
John Jerome, the servant that had brought&#xD;
Stephen the hot brandy and water. ,His&#xD;
name was John Jerome Douglas ; but .they&#xD;
called him John Jerome. The Douglas had&#xD;
been dropped so long that he had nearly for-&#xD;
gotten it. He had come to the conclusion&#xD;
that two names would -call'him through life&#xD;
as well as three.&#xD;
There was only one thing the 'matter with&#xD;
. John Jerome ; he was wicked. He would&#xD;
have been a good man, .had' lie not been&#xD;
wicked; but wickedness got a side-lock upon&#xD;
him, and gave him a heavy fall, from which&#xD;
he never recovered. John Jerome never&#xD;
wrestled with sin after that fall. He was up&#xD;
for the highest bidder, and down for the&#xD;
lowest offices. His deeds had found a record&#xD;
upon  his face.  It was a countenance&#xD;
smutched with evil' thoughts. Sibylla did&#xD;
not like John Jerome. 'er dislike dated&#xD;
from the moment that he set foot within the&#xD;
portals of the house. It appeared to her&#xD;
that if God were going to make a hypocrite,&#xD;
he would make him in the shape of John&#xD;
Jerome. - Hypocrisy is a vile thing ; so vile&#xD;
that all the World is fond'of it, and runs after&#xD;
it, and practices it.&#xD;
&#xD;
V4&#xD;
&#xD;
Sibylla had an instinctive. fear of Mn,&#xD;
Her communications with him had ,e-b&#xD;
limited to simple corpmands, and no nore of&#xD;
them than needful. HIe put restraint upon&#xD;
himself in her presence, and practiced ct '&#xD;
'simulation ; but the girl was not deceived.&#xD;
She saw through the flimsy, vail of respect$&#xD;
and distrusted him still.&#xD;
Seeing that face, at that hour, with its cun-&#xD;
ning and stealthiness, alarmed her. Some-&#xD;
thing was afoot. The house was not going&#xD;
on in its usmal orderly way. W4iy should he&#xD;
steal into the hall on tiptoe?. There was ap&#xD;
evident' purpose of watchfulness in his ma-&#xD;
ner. Sibylla fesolyed that he should come&#xD;
no nearer. She thrust her arm forward, .4&#xD;
waved it slowly up and down. Her aim&#xD;
and hand looked ghastly white in the pale&#xD;
spectral light.of the hall. John Jerome saw&#xD;
the hand, thought of 13elshazza'r, and fled.&#xD;
She heard him hurrying along the - hall&#xD;
toward the servants' quarter. @he ran after&#xD;
hIm, and reached the. corner in tine to see&#xD;
his back as he passed through the door.&#xD;
Satisfied that this spy upon the actions of her&#xD;
guardian had gone, her -feelings of curiosity&#xD;
returned and drew her, footsteps back.. She&#xD;
glided, shivering, to the door through- which&#xD;
Stephen and Magnus had borne the box ; but&#xD;
lacked courage to turn the key and look in.&#xD;
She put forth her hand several times, and&#xD;
her resolution as often failed.  She asked.&#xD;
her conscience, if she had a right to satisfy&#xD;
her inquisitiveness in such a manner. To&#xD;
hover around interdicted spots ; to lurk at&#xD;
keyholes; t'o lie in. wait, at. unexpected&#xD;
places ; to play 'the spy upon' the actions of&#xD;
one she-loved, were things in many respects,&#xD;
repulsive to her nature.' Hence her nervous&#xD;
flutterings and her faltering fears.&#xD;
She grasped the key and turned it'with a&#xD;
spasmodic motion. Magnus, havin  pm sse4&#xD;
last, had turned the key and left it in the&#xD;
l6ck. Stephen would hsve put the key'in&#xD;
his pocket, being a man particular in do-&#xD;
tails.&#xD;
Sibylla Joy pushed open the door the&#xD;
width of her face, anduplifted her pyes.&#xD;
She saw 'nothing. Yes, she saw somethin--&#xD;
'the foot of.Stephen's bed-and the foot of a&#xD;
men. She was not certain about the latter ;&#xD;
f9r her trepidations obscured her sight, and&#xD;
her haste baffled herself. She durs not look&#xD;
again ; for she heard Stephen and Magnus&#xD;
returning. She closed the door, locked it,&#xD;
ang flitted back to the other hall, where she&#xD;
aused, determined to put the personality of&#xD;
the two persons beyond doubt, by ' ocular&#xD;
evidence. phe peered around the corner,&#xD;
-and doubt vanished ; she saw Stephen un-&#xD;
locking the door and Magnus behind him.&#xD;
Sibylla had not in the least lessened the&#xD;
mystery ; on the contrary, she magnified it,&#xD;

- and caused.it to assume vast proportions. It&#xD;
was a simple concealment at first ; it was&#xD;
now a bewilderment. She flew to her first&#xD;
ambush, and tried to hear something that&#xD;
-would guide her mind and shape her&#xD;
thoughts, or at least direct them toward a&#xD;
a given point. , Thus far, her surmises had&#xD;
received no impul~e to' push them on to cer-&#xD;
tainty. She learned but. little by her re-&#xD;
newed vigil. She heard the name of Richard&#xD;
Parkhurst mentioned several times; but its&#xD;
connection with the conversation entirely&#xD;
eluded her.' She finally retired to her cham-&#xD;
bet, disappointed, harassed by vague appre-&#xD;
hensiops, and followed by gloomy forebod-&#xD;
ings.&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
DUKE MARMADUKE.&#xD;
Richard Parkhurst reached his lodgings at&#xD;
eleven o'clock.' He lived on a street-more&#xD;
noted for Its mysteries than its morals. His&#xD;
lodgings were more obscure than elegant,&#xD;
but much in harmony with hiis life and hab-&#xD;
its. Richard had nobody to take care of but&#xD;
himself. Had he had any one to. take care of&#xD;
but himself, that boy or girl, man or woman,&#xD;
would have been poorly cared for. He could&#xD;
not take care of himself; at least, he had not.&#xD;
He had neither fallen into the waeer nor into.&#xD;
the fire, but he had fallen into evil company&#xD;
and into evil ways. Neither had he starved&#xD;
to death nor gone naked ;. but he had fed his&#xD;
qpul on husks, and covered it with rags. In&#xD;
some manner, Richard had beexi born wrong&#xD;
and gone wrong. Richard's nature was in-&#xD;
verted, either through fault of Fate or fault&#xD;
of his own. His moral sight saw things up-&#xD;
side down,' and after a while he came to&#xD;
think that that was the way for them to be.&#xD;
He was very acid' inside, was Richard ; and&#xD;
he liked the world as little'as it liked him.&#xD;
He considered the world a miserable concern.&#xD;
Human creatures, in 'his, ethics, were raven-&#xD;
ous beasts, fighting for the crumbs Of life,-&#xD;
and tearing each other cruelly.. He mollified&#xD;
his mangled conscience by. pouring into it&#xD;
the oil of this sophistry. He affirmed that&#xD;
there was no difference in mankind. One&#xD;
was as good as another ; and, none better&#xD;
than himself. They were scrambling for ex-&#xD;
istence, and he was-scrambling too. Some&#xD;
whined, canted, and driveled, while they&#xD;
were scrambling ; but he, scorning hypoc-&#xD;
risy, snarled and snapped at the hands or&#xD;
feet that annoyed him. He had snapped and&#xD;
snarled so much, that a furrow was drawn&#xD;
obliquely across each cheek, and his brow&#xD;
was knitted into a chronic frown. Cunning&#xD;
was his counselor, hypocrisy his helper. In&#xD;
his daily walks he met no one whom he&#xD;
-would not as soon have out of the world as&#xD;
in it.' To eat, to drink, and to wear, were to&#xD;
&#xD;
him the chief ends of existence. He aspired,&#xD;
however,to good eating, good drinking, and&#xD;
good wearing, without a single scruple re-&#xD;
specting the methods of attainment. He had&#xD;
nothing to lose ; millions to gain. He had&#xD;
a strong intellect, badly willed. An' ar-&#xD;
rant schemer was Richard. He lived, moved,&#xD;
and had his being among 'broken plots and&#xD;
pyramids of abortive projects. Artifice and&#xD;
shift, cabal and alternative, had a fostering&#xD;
parent in Richard. They 'brooded in his&#xD;
brain, and perched nightly among his fan-&#xD;
cies.&#xD;
Richard, while fumbling for his nightkey,&#xD;
saw a lighttistreaming through the closed&#xD;
blinds, and knew very well who was within.&#xD;
It was his friend, his familiar spirit, his&#xD;
prompter, his suggestive Satan, Duke Marima-&#xD;
duke.&#xD;
This man came and went athis own pleas-&#xD;
ure. Sometimes he remained days and&#xD;
weeks-with Richard ; then disappeared with-&#xD;
out warning, and returned without notice.&#xD;
His fiittings were eccentric, and as numerous&#xD;

lair, and could go in and out at will.&#xD;
. Duke Marmaduke was an Englishman.&#xD;
He often boasted of-his blood ; but of that&#xD;
the author knows nothing, and cares less ;&#xD;
being more interested in his actions than in&#xD;
his fluids.&#xD;
Whatever had been. his trials, sufferings,&#xD;
and temptations, they had not affected his ap-&#xD;
petite ; he had accumulated more fat than&#xD;
grace'; and his stomach was larger than his&#xD;
charities. His digestive arrangements were&#xD;
of the most ample description, and had as-&#xD;
sumed such rotund dimensions as to push&#xD;
him backward, and give his figure a palpable&#xD;
strut ; not so much indicative of pride as of&#xD;
paunch. Marmaduke -had short fleshy legs,&#xD;
short fleshy arms, and short fat hands. His&#xD;
shortness did not stop with the members&#xD;
mentioned'; he had a short neck set upon&#xD;
broad shoulders. It was thick and fat, and&#xD;
his throat'was white. His skin was fair, his&#xD;
cheeks, puffed' and rosy-; his lips, red, full,&#xD;
andtsensual, witir white but irregular teeth&#xD;
showing through them. 'He had what are&#xD;
vulgarly called "cat-teeth" in the angles of&#xD;
his upper jaw, which, being long and sharp,&#xD;
gave him the appearance of a carniverous&#xD;
animal. His forehead was arched like a bent&#xD;
bow, and not very high. This forehead, set&#xD;
upon his round cheeks, made his face look&#xD;
like a full moon, ruddy and beaming. His&#xD;
hair, which was light and thin, was parted&#xD;
in the middle with much care. His eye-&#xD;
brows were a shade darker than his hair.&#xD;
Marmadnke's eyes were small and round, and&#xD;
of an indescribable gray. They shone in the&#xD;
dark like a cat's. He sometimes wore specta-&#xD;
cles with tortoise-shell bows, the glasses of&#xD;

Mr. Pavids applied his handkerchief to his&#xD;
eyes, and was pnuch affected.&#xD;
" she'was a sweet girl, Mr. Davids," said&#xD;
Mrs. Hall, quite melted. "But beauty Is a&#xD;
snare. I allus said that beauty wasa snare&#xD;
and a temptation. My Letty now is dreadful&#xD;
plain, and it does seem to me, that there is a&#xD;
providence in it to keep her out of harm's&#xD;
way. I'm reallyglad that Letty is homely;&#xD;
for you see nobody runs away with a homely&#xD;
fae." .&#xD;
Mrs. iall turned to Stephen1arkhurst, and&#xD;
added:&#xD;
&#xD;
'Fannie Davids, Sir, isaslovelyaereatre&#xD;

is exposed, is enough to try the patience' of&#xD;
Job !"&#xD;
" Have you put the police on her track?"&#xD;
Stephen wished to know.&#xD;
" I've spoken to a couple of detectives, and&#xD;
they will commence the business to-night,'&#xD;
said Mr. Dtvids. "But I'm afraid they won't-&#xD;
matifest much zeal, Sir ; for I'ma poor man,&#xD;
and not able to fee them very liberally."&#xD;
" Fees should not be demanded by the serv-&#xD;
ants of the people," replied Stephen, with&#xD;
warmth. " The-city pays its officials ; and no&#xD;
private citizen, however humble, need put his&#xD;
hand in his pocket to bribe them for'the per-&#xD;
formance of an obvious duty. Neverthe-&#xD;
less, generosity is a good thing, and all who&#xD;
are able to do so would do well to quicken&#xD;
the zeal of the faithful officer by suitable&#xD;
tokens of appreciation. In' a case like this,&#xD;
one cannot afford'to be niggardly ; for money&#xD;
is but dross, while fidelity is above all price,&#xD;
and worthy of admiration."&#xD;
Parkhurst looked significantly at Magnus&#xD;
Drake, who, understanding his meaning, ob-&#xD;
served:&#xD;
"What my friend says is perfectly true.&#xD;
It is as much our duty to be generous when&#xD;
,we can, as it is of the officer to be always&#xD;
faithful, whether in the service of the rich or&#xD;
poor. I am'so much interested in this mat-&#xD;
ter that I will willingly lend the influence of&#xD;
my ,voice, and the ,stronger influence of my&#xD;
purse, to rescue your daughter, and to secure&#xD;
the ends of justice."&#xD;
"I thank ycu, Sir," answered Mr. Davids,&#xD;
gratefully. 'If you would join in the search,&#xD;
gentlemen, I should be forever indebted to&#xD;
you. There are sone deeds which nothing&#xD;
but eternal gratitude can reward. To-night,&#xD;
properly prepared for the adventure, armed&#xD;
at all points, we're going to visit the vilest&#xD;

it is attended with peril ; and a midnight-ex-&#xD;

troubles others. You have passed the'age of&#xD;

&#xD;
passage was very narrow and very dark and&#xD;
much worn under foot. Droolby began to&#xD;
open crazy doors, and Stephen Parkhurst be-&#xD;
ran to see filth and poverty at their worst.&#xD;
hey went into holes, which were called&#xD;
cribs, where miserable human creatures were&#xD;
huddled together like vermin. In some of&#xD;
those sweltering graves the stench was in-&#xD;
tolerable. Stephen andsMagnus often turned&#xD;
back to gasp for the better air of the alleys.&#xD;
They went up complaining stairs. The de-&#xD;
tectives used their clubs; they thumped and&#xD;
rattled at rickety doors, which threatened to&#xD;
fall beneath their blows. If the swinish in-&#xD;
mates delayed unreasonably, if they were too&#xD;
drunk to lift latch, or push bolt or bar with&#xD;
alacrity, they were soundly berated by Drool-&#xD;
by and Driggs. Sometimes there was con-&#xD;
siderable fumbling and shuffling before the&#xD;
dingy doors turned to reveal the sodden mis-&#xD;
ery within. Profanity and obscenity hailed&#xD;
both ingress and egress, and followed them&#xD;
with harsh pertinacity to the next kennel.&#xD;
In many instances, blacks and whites were&#xD;
found herded together ; and Driggs asserted,&#xD;
gravely, that the blacks were as bad as the&#xD;
whites. Parkhurst shrugged his shoulders,&#xD;
and did not express a doubt of the veracity of&#xD;
that knowing official. It did seem probable&#xD;
to him that the negro might sink as low as&#xD;
any-..&#xD;
one bare crib beneath the ridgepole they&#xD;
found ten or a dozen hateful hags, the sight&#xD;
of whom made Stephen shiver. They were&#xD;
tattered and torn, wrinkled and wry, gray&#xD;
and grizzly, toothless and tart, trenchant and&#xD;
testy, wicked and witch-like, malignant,&#xD;
mouthing crones, with no place to-lay their&#xD;
- evish heads and half-naked bodies. One&#xD;
sunken-jawed harridan gibbered and gibed&#xD;
at Stephen, and doubling her long, skeleton&#xD;
fingers into ghastly fists, shook them in Ste-&#xD;
phen's face, while her elfish locks drifted like&#xD;
coiled snakes about her shriveled face and&#xD;
skinny neck. Stephen recoiled in terror&#xD;
from this horrible shape which followed him&#xD;
up, menacing and gesticulating like nothing&#xD;
human. He thought that hel had disem-&#xD;
bogued, and lost a few   of its choicest&#xD;
ogresses.&#xD;
The crib contained but one single mov-&#xD;
able, and that was a basket.&#xD;
"That   conwenience,"  quoth  Droolby,&#xD;
pointing with a very black detective finger,&#xD;
"Ais which they goes a stealin' with."&#xD;
After this enlightemng observation, Mr.&#xD;
Droolby considerately rescued Stephen from&#xD;
the hag.&#xD;
Where do they sleep?" inquired Magnus,&#xD;
whose notionsof life and lodgings seemed&#xD;
greatly confused.&#xD;
"In their skins," said Driggs, with a&#xD;
humorous grimace.&#xD;
&#xD;
" On the bare floor," amended Droolby.&#xD;
Davids remarked that he should think the&#xD;
poor wretch would freeze in winter weather.&#xD;
"Freezel!" repeated Droolby with immense&#xD;
contempt. "What is there to. freeze of 'em?&#xD;
Can't freeze.parchment, can ye? Can't freeze&#xD;
dry bones, can ye ? Nor dry sawdust, nor&#xD;
unpowder ? Not bad, I reckin. - Not wery&#xD;
Droolby's line of argument was considered&#xD;
final and satisfactory, Magnus merely obeerv-&#xD;
ing :&#xD;
" They do look very crisp and bony."&#xD;
"There isn't no marrer in 'em," quoth&#xD;
Droolby.&#xD;
The hags shrieked in concert, and brand-&#xD;
ished their skeleton arms, as if they meditat-&#xD;
ed a simultaneous attack.&#xD;
"Look at 'em !" added Droolby. "Look&#xD;
at the bingomorts ! You might split 'em into&#xD;
kindling's with wery little sweatin'."&#xD;
" The devil might kindle his fire with them&#xD;
for I wouldn't," said Mr. Davids. "And&#xD;
here," he added, taking Magnus by the sleeve&#xD;
to detain him a little longer. "I'd point a&#xD;
moral and adorn a tale. 'All this comes of&#xD;
not keeping above the tide."&#xD;
"Above the tide I" exclaimed Droolby, with&#xD;
indignant incredulty. "It's a lie! Throw&#xD;
them 'ere critters into the water, an' they'll&#xD;
float like corks, every one of 'em !"&#xD;
" I was speaking figuratively," said Davids.&#xD;
I was referring to the tide of life which&#xD;
floats us all, drifting one one way, and an-&#xD;
other another. They didn't keep their heads&#xD;
atop of it. It flowed over 'em; it sunk 'em;&#xD;
it did the job for 'em. And that's where&#xD;
they be at the present time. They're under,&#xD;
and the tide is standing on 'em. There's jus.&#xD;
the difference of being above or below, top-&#xD;
most or undermost, hindmost or foremost.&#xD;
" The tide is a standin' on 'em?" repeated&#xD;
Droolby, with contempt. " There isn't no-&#xD;
thin' standin' on 'em as I can see, 'ceptia'&#xD;
their rags, an' them don't stan' much to the&#xD;
pint. Sich nonsense isn't the valley o'&#xD;
that !"t&#xD;
Droolby snapped his thumb and finger,&#xD;
and led th way downward toward the base-&#xD;
ment. O the wyay they glanced into a ken-&#xD;
nel, where ;there were three infants lying&#xD;
upon three heaps of shavings.&#xD;
" Sich is life," said Droolby. " Them is&#xD;
from small beginnings. Tall aches from lit-&#xD;
tle ocorns grow."&#xD;
"Infants !" exclaimed Davids, sentiment-&#xD;
ally.. "You're young ; keep above the tide."&#xD;
"They will have to begin soon to do that,"&#xD;
observed MagnusA&#xD;
"They was born under water," asserted&#xD;
Droolby, oracularly.&#xD;
" The little coves will float one of these&#xD;
days, perhaps," offered Driggs, as a kind of&#xD;

looked often at Magiue. Could he have beeh.&#xD;
safelyhI the street, he would have been well&#xD;
content. The squalid creatures about him ;&#xD;
the tattered men 'aud half-naked women,;&#xD;
the nauseous fumes of gin, beer, and onions,&#xD;
combined with miscellaneous: stenchea; the&#xD;
tramping, jumping, and clattering ; the rapid&#xD;
emotions,. the varied contortions, and the&#xD;
grotesque irregularities ; the shouting, the&#xD;
wild laughter, the unseemly jestings, together&#xD;
with tile utter abandonment of the restraints&#xD;
of civilized life, had such an effect  upon the&#xD;
educated nerves and refined taste of Stephen&#xD;
Parkhurst, that he longed to fly from the,&#xD;
scene as from a pestilence.&#xD;
" Come, Bolter," said Droolby, by-and-by,&#xD;
when his taste had lingered long enough on&#xD;
the flavor of the detestable gin, "we must.&#xD;
leave the dells an' the culleys, an' take a look&#xD;
,t yer private affairs."&#xD;
'Think o' my reputation," quoth Bolter.&#xD;
" What If these bene coves should cackle ?"&#xD;
"Deek the cadger I" (see the thief) ex-&#xD;
claimed Droolby. " He pretends to doubt&#xD;
Droolby an' Driggs.   ie's goin' to turn&#xD;
autum-bawler (parson), an' save his good&#xD;
name an' his soul at the same time. But it&#xD;
won't do. You'll make as likely a sprout as&#xD;
ever 'ow'd from a acorn."&#xD;
" Yer mighty rough on a pal as has allus&#xD;
come down Jiandsome with the cole," grum-&#xD;
bled Bolter.&#xD;
" Come, you Bolter 1" retorted Droolby.&#xD;
"Don't go for to accuse a honest chap of&#xD;
bribery, eruption, blackmail, an' sich. Cut&#xD;
bene whids an' amputate yer mahogany (give&#xD;
civil words and be off with you).  Yer a sly&#xD;

cover. A bit o' kidnapping' has been done&#xD;
of late, an' I'm on the trail. So move yer&#xD;
pins, an' open yer private boxes."&#xD;
" These coves needn't go;" said Bolter,&#xD;
looking at Stephen, Magnus, and Davids.&#xD;
" There's some things they don't need to,&#xD;
know."&#xD;
" Don't stan' chaffin'," answered Droolby.&#xD;
" These is fren's as has a very deep interest&#xD;
in this case. Where Driggs an' me goes, they&#xD;
goes. Don't be vicious ',&#xD;
Droolby scowled at the " damber cove",&#xD;
and made an ostentatious dislay of his billy.&#xD;
lolter muttered, and- taking a "glint",&#xD;
nodded to Droolby to follow.&#xD;
Magnus, who was closely observing every&#xD;
moveinent, spoke in a low voice to Parkhurst,&#xD;
and said :&#xD;
"Manage to drop behind, and escape, if&#xD;
possible. One of us must escape. If oppor-&#xD;
tunity offers to me, and not to you, I will im-&#xD;
prove it. So let it be understood."&#xD;
" I approve of it," answered -Parkhurst.&#xD;

insure the safety of both. I am afraid, Mag-j&#xD;

"Thank heaven, yes !" Whispered Magnus.&#xD;
"Here it is; take it. Providence guide your&#xD;
hand should you have o gcasion to use it !&#xD;
Remember to keep behind, and if you sud-&#xD;
. denly miss me, bear in mind that it is not a&#xD;
cowardly desertion.  We shall soon lknow&#xD;
whether these men mean mischief.. In some&#xD;
of the murky passages one of us may loiter a&#xD;
moment, perhaps, without being missed ;&#xD;
and that moment may suffice. A moment is&#xD;
sometimes fraught with momentous conse-&#xD;
quences."&#xD;
A small revolver changed hands adroitly.&#xD;
Davids saw a quick, and as it seemed to him,&#xD;
stealthy movement ; but what it had accom-&#xD;
plished, or what it had portended, 4e could&#xD;
only suspect. That person's grief fo? the ab-&#xD;
duction of his daughter appeared of a fitful&#xD;
character. The consciousness of his trouble&#xD;
came and went strangely. He did not evince&#xD;
that constant anxiety that the ostensible situa-&#xD;
tion naturally demanded. :He kept above the&#xD;
tide, to use his own figurative style, wonder-&#xD;
fully well. The conviction that deception&#xD;
had been practiced, had grown so strong in&#xD;
Stephen's mind, that it was very much like&#xD;
certainty. He glanced at the squalid faces&#xD;
that made the ken look like the .abode of&#xD;
fiends, in the faint hope of finding evidence&#xD;
of sufficeent goodness to hang an expectation&#xD;
upon ; but he might as well have searched a&#xD;
Pandemonium for a cool spring of water.&#xD;
CHAPTER     XV.&#xD;
IN THE TRAP.&#xD;
Under different circumstances,' Stephen&#xD;
would have been glad to leave the wretches,&#xD;
whose boisterous levity made him sick at&#xD;
heart ; but as matters were, when he followed&#xD;
Droolby, Driggs; and Davids, from the lair,&#xD;
and the door closed after him, he felt a sort&#xD;
of regret; and human companionship, how-&#xD;
ever degraded, he esteemed preferable to the&#xD;
gloomy uncertainty before him, under the&#xD;
guidance of Bolter.&#xD;
It was then that he began to realize how&#xD;
much he was cut off from the busy, breath-&#xD;
ing world. To perpetrate crime in such a&#xD;
place, was nearly equivalent to-a guaranty of&#xD;
immunity from punishment. A blow, a&#xD;
thrust, would accomplish the deed. Even a&#xD;
pistoLshot would attract no attention from&#xD;
persons in the streets. He thought how easy&#xD;
it was to stop the beating of a heart and the&#xD;
pulsation of an artery. He looked at Mag-&#xD;
nus, and sighed for Ursula and Sibylla, and&#xD;
the safety of the brown-stone house. Lost&#xD;
homes are regretted. He said to himself;&#xD;
&#xD;
"lithe to; Y 'hhvb been happy without&#xD;
knowing it."&#xD;
Botier edthred another den, where'a with-&#xD;
ered old *omatih aa brewing  eS kind of a&#xD;
both over  smoke. We call it a Smoke,&#xD;
because very little flame was visible. There&#xD;
Was a younger woman thefe,-and a-deforned&#xD;
boy burrowed in a corner.&#xD;
" Asnuggery, this is," said Dr-olby. "Yer&#xD;
oen private conweniency, I spect?"&#xD;
Bolter answered : "Yes."&#xD;
" Warn in winter an' cool 'in summer,"&#xD;
added Droolby. "'T*otild bS wery-pleasant,&#xD;
howsomever, if yer had a pluckier draft to&#xD;
yer fireplace."&#xD;
The arrangement for getting rid of the&#xD;
smoke was very simple. A rusty Stovepipe&#xD;
had been ingeniously introduced into achim-&#xD;
ney above.&#xD;
" Don't go for to give yerself the gout with&#xD;
high livin'," admonished  Droolby, face-&#xD;
tiously. " Use pavin'stones for soup, an' save&#xD;
yer bones agin a time o' need. Strong wittles&#xD;
does violence to the stoniiok.",&#xD;
The ancient beldame shook a battered iron&#xD;
spoon at the brilliant Droolby.,&#xD;
" Wentilate yer wiciousnSss," said he, pre-&#xD;
serving that amiable temper that so much&#xD;
distinguished him._. "This here is yer own&#xD;
hotel, an' yer not obleeged to entertain angels&#xD;
unawar's, 'thout givin' 'em a piece, o' yer&#xD;
nilhd."          ,    -.&#xD;
" Don't vex her," said Bolter.&#xD;
" Wex her !" quoth Droolby. "You can't&#xD;
wex her. Her temper's sweeter 'n winegar.&#xD;
It's jolly to have a 'wirtuotus household.&#xD;
Here's a infant, too. A reg'lar Richard&#xD;
Third, that ,infant is. He'll take to tragedy,&#xD;
as a fish to the water. No iakin' up to do.&#xD;
Born with the shoulders on.. What an in-&#xD;
Wention! Yer a deep un, Bolter. That's&#xD;
wot I call lookin' ahead. 'Twas done \by&#xD;
breakin' his back, I spect.",&#xD;
The-deformed boy crept-behind his mother,&#xD;
who sat gazing absently at the few smoking.&#xD;
fagots on the broken bricks, called by court-&#xD;
esy a fire-place, and which was but a miser-&#xD;
able caricature of that useful contrivance.&#xD;
l3olters den was a burlesque on life and liv-&#xD;
ing ; if things so serious can be burlesqued.&#xD;
Misery is often grotesque, and is always sad.,&#xD;
" His back might as well been broke,"&#xD;
muttered the hag, who was simmering the&#xD;
witch-broth, " for all the good he does. If I&#xD;
had my way, I'd throw him into the'sewer,&#xD;
hump and all. I'd send him out of this, least-&#xD;
ways. He's as able to go a begin' pan' Mteal-,&#xD;
in' as any kiddy of his age. I believes in&#xD;
ev'ry one doin' their part."&#xD;
The ogress thrust her spoon into' the dia-&#xD;
bolical caldron, and made a commotion among&#xD;
the bones; then added, in adismal, croaking&#xD;
strain:&#xD;
&#xD;
"Why do ye bfing all-these gain' coves&#xD;
down here ? Ain't they nothin' to do, but to&#xD;
ioke their noses into other folkses business ?&#xD;
Bingavast, an' leave me alone 1"&#xD;
Hold up, you batamaran! Ugly woman t&#xD;
Ain't got a bleak imort stoWed away amongg&#xD;
yer duds, have,ye ?"&#xD;
Stephen looked for the duds spoken of, but&#xD;
could sde nothing but a heap, of sticks and&#xD;
chips, some shavings in a box, an old tin&#xD;
dipper, and the kettle sweating over the&#xD;
smoke.&#xD;
" Peer and peep !" qcuoth the ogress. "Yer&#xD;
welcome to all ye'll find. There's a good&#xD;
many cornets, you see," she went on, sarcast-&#xD;
ically, "an' a +good many holes where a gal&#xD;
could be hid. A gal brought here again her&#xD;
will, wbldi't raake no noise, I s'pose 1"&#xD;
" That's what I told 'em,"said Bolter; but&#xD;
Droolby thinks I've had a-hand in't."&#xD;
"Stop yer patter 1" retorted Droolby, au-&#xD;
thoritatively. "This- ain't all, an' ye know it.&#xD;
Come, pall up yer traps,an' bring on."&#xD;
"If I'must,'1 must," answered "'olter, dog-&#xD;
gedly, moving the box that contained -the&#xD;
shavings.&#xD;
"I wouldn't be, so tame.'bout it," mumbled&#xD;
the old woman.- " I'd have no bandogs bark-&#xD;
in' underneath. If I hates anythin', it's the&#xD;
whelps o' the law, which is -allus disturbin'&#xD;
on us, an' a stirring' us up, an' a coming' an'&#xD;
going , and  kin'.our bene coves away, for no&#xD;
reason wh   omever, an' a clapping' their&#xD;
wrists in rules. There is no liberties. Our&#xD;
liberties is gone, an' the traps has; gobbled&#xD;
'em. If I had my way, I'd dub no jigger but&#xD;
on compulsion."&#xD;
"That old leddy," quoth Droolby, "is&#xD;
ready for the hemp. It's a pitty to keep her&#xD;
a waitin'. But 'Tyburn tippets are not so&#xD;
easy to be come at in' this 'ere free an' easy&#xD;
Gotham."&#xD;
"Bottle yer gab, or yell git this kettle o'&#xD;
soup on yer head, as ye go down the gang-&#xD;
way."&#xD;
While Droolby and the hag were thus pat-&#xD;
tering, Bolter,-greatly to the surprise of Ste-&#xD;
phen 'and Magnus, lifted a trapdoor and re-&#xD;
'vealed a black hole at his feet.&#xD;
" Give me yer darkey" (lantern), he said,&#xD;
an come along."     ,&#xD;
Bolter stepped into the hole, and had it not&#xD;
been for (the light of the lantern, he would&#xD;
have entirely disappeared in the Stygian&#xD;
darkness. ':.here was a moment's hesitation&#xD;
about the -order of going, which Droolby&#xD;
terminated by thrusting himself into the sus-&#xD;
picious, aperture. Driggs glanced at David,&#xD;
and': the latter went next, with the observa-&#xD;
tion:&#xD;
"It looks like going' under the tide."&#xD;
" Come on,"'added.Driggs, addressing Mag-&#xD;
-nus and-Stephen.- "Go down, an' doniUt be&#xD;

Driggs stepped back, and it was evident to a general scuffle;, followed, during which&#xD;
Parkhurst and his friend, that he had set his Stephen found himself seized by the shoul-&#xD;

was disturbed by fears that were.not un-&#xD;
founded. His.body was scercely less miser-&#xD;
able than- his mind. The wet walls, the&#xD;
clayey floor,,the thick and stifling air, all had&#xD;
their effect upon the sensitive organization of&#xD;
Stephen. But more than-the damp and the&#xD;
mould, more than the nausea of the sweating&#xD;
atmosphere, more than the natural shrink-&#xD;
ings from pain, more than the tortures of&#xD;
wild conjecture, was"his paternal solicitude&#xD;
for the peace and safety of Ursula. Ursula&#xD;
took possession 9f the fatherly heart, and&#xD;
reigned there supreme, the queen of his affec-&#xD;
tions.  The same paternal instinct drew&#xD;
Sibylla into the charmed circle of his love,&#xD;
and held her there in the kindly folds of&#xD;
memory.- For them he trembled, for them&#xD;
,fe suffered, for them his nature was aroused ;&#xD;
and he resolved to bear up bravely, and 'to&#xD;
fight misfortune with all his strength, never&#xD;
yielding to discouragement, despondency, or&#xD;
despair.              '&#xD;
CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
IN THE WINE-VAULT.&#xD;
Sibylla Joy was not satisfied with the&#xD;
apparent death of her guardian. To her,&#xD;
Stephen Parkhurst was not dead. She could&#xD;
not, as the common remark 3s, "make him&#xD;
dead". It is a homely form of expression ;&#xD;
but singularly applicable to certain states of&#xD;
the mind.&#xD;
She . thought that death had strangely&#xD;
transformed the features of her friend. She&#xD;
stole into the room many times, while the&#xD;
body was lying in the house, to look at the&#xD;
face of Stephen.&#xD;
An extraordinary doubt grew within her ;&#xD;
a doubt which the more she gazed the more it&#xD;
grew. She was bewildered. A problem was&#xD;
before her which she knew'not how to solve.&#xD;
She had seen and conversed with Stephen&#xD;
Parkhurst a few hours before his decease.&#xD;
Every lineament of his face was strongly&#xD;
impressed upon her consciousness. His lips,&#xD;
his brows, his eye-lashes, his hair, the peculiar&#xD;
oblique lines that traversed his cheeks, were&#xD;
so minutely daguerreotyped upon her memo-&#xD;
ry, that not to identify him, under any cir-&#xD;
cumstances, seemed to her 'an impossibility.&#xD;
Alone with that pale mortality, she knelt by&#xD;
the bedside ; but -could .not grieve as she&#xD;
thought she ought. She arose, and said to&#xD;
herself:&#xD;
"This is not my benefactor's face. It is&#xD;
like it, but it is not it. Does death change the&#xD;
mold and contour of the beloved face so&#xD;
much, that, we cannot know it'? Let me&#xD;
think," she continued. "'Let me recall what&#xD;
happened. He 'sent me for Magnus Drake.&#xD;
He was kind and smiling, and petted me.&#xD;
There was a pan of charcoal on the hearth,&#xD;
thrust partly beneath the broken grate. That&#xD;
&#xD;
BIBYLL&#xD;
&#xD;
A JO.                                51&#xD;
was not a.thing that I can remember having&#xD;
seen before; but I did not give it particular&#xD;
notice. I returned safely. Stephen's mood&#xD;
had changed somewhat. He was grave, yet&#xD;
tender. How I loved .his calm, firm face.'&#xD;
She paused, and murmured :&#xD;
" Not this race. He' evidently desired to&#xD;
be alone. He enforced my going in an unu-&#xD;
sual way. Therewas something touching in&#xD;
his imperativeness. He pushed me out, and,&#xD;
drawn by an irresistible impulse, I opened the&#xD;
door'again. I never shall forget his pleasant&#xD;
words.  0  gentle father.!  0  indulgent&#xD;
friend I I weep to think of him as he was ;&#xD;
but I shudder at this."&#xD;
She drew back a little from the body.&#xD;
"I lingered in the hall. What did I hear ?&#xD;
The shuffling of feet, by-and-by ; .the sup-&#xD;
pressed voices of Stephen and Magnus, at&#xD;
first. The question is, What did those men&#xD;
come for ? According to the apprehension of&#xD;
my ear,' they bi-oughtsomething. One can&#xD;
tell when men are bringing something, even&#xD;
in an adjoining room.   What did they&#xD;
bring?"&#xD;
Thus far, Sibylla's train of reasoning was&#xD;
fair, and'in harmony with-the laws of deduc-&#xD;
tion. She had begun rightly, and with the&#xD;
full force of logic. It was the proper method&#xD;
of analysis. A transaction must be measured&#xD;
by itself, weigif&amp;amp;l by its own weight, gtiaged&#xD;
by its own intrinsic width and depth. Every&#xD;
event carries with"it iii own evidence, and&#xD;
analytical minds will seize upon it with sing-&#xD;
ular certainty.&#xD;
Sibylla wenton.  -A species of mathemat-&#xD;
ical inspiration guided her.&#xD;
" I heard sounds. Sounds mean something.&#xD;
They tell what is being done. Well, what&#xD;
did those sounds say ? That nails were being&#xD;
drawn, or a-box opened. Yes, a box was&#xD;
opened, I should think. The more I reflect,&#xD;
the more I sin convinced. How"clear' it&#xD;
becomes ! Those persons whose feet'I heard,&#xD;
brought in a box by the private door, and the&#xD;
creaking and crepitation that I distinguished,&#xD;
were produced by prying off the cover with&#xD;
some instrument.  The box contained-&#xD;
What did it -contain ? Wine, perhaps. A&#xD;
very choice wine, probably. Why did he&#xD;
receive it privately? Why did they whisper&#xD;
and step softly? Need there be secrecy about&#xD;
a box of wine?   Not ordinarily.  What&#xD;
next? If I am a good listener there was con-&#xD;
siderable manipulation after the men departed.&#xD;
Magnus was there, and the charcoal was&#xD;
there. I could smell the charcoal."&#xD;
Here Sibylla reached another important&#xD;
question.&#xD;
" Would Magnus Drake go away and leave&#xD;
his friend exposed to danger? He would&#xD;
not, provided he had any means of suspecting&#xD;
the same. Had there been any morbid ten,&#xD;

were "1fin bastes', and used his brush, and&#xD;

Rubert Frothingham sauntered back to his&#xD;
beat, apparently unconscious that a mishap&#xD;
had happened to any guests of the.house.&#xD;
Hubert walked over to the smith's, to see&#xD;
if the job was done well, or, possibly, for ex-&#xD;
ercise. He paid the smith liberally, too, for&#xD;
doing a little work for him which kept the&#xD;
stranger's horse waiting for his shoe two&#xD;
hours. All this might have been accidental,&#xD;
but it looked like design. The traveling-car-&#xD;
riage, which had brought the young man's&#xD;
destiny, remained housed at the Golden&#xD;
Robin that night.   Frothingham   walked&#xD;
beneath a certain window till a late hour,,&#xD;
with an abstracted affectation of carelessness&#xD;
and utter indifferenceto everything pertain&#xD;
ing, to thes Golden Rtobin. If he thought him-&#xD;
self observed, he protracted his walk l1eyond&#xD;
the area of the inn, and came back as rapt&#xD;
and absent-minded as before. 'He tired every&#xD;

eyes upon that wmndpw, and sighed when he&#xD;
thought of the fair occupant. 'Whiile he was&#xD;
looking fpr the ,fftiethtime, the curtain was&#xD;
put aside and the sash raised. Then a white&#xD;
hand was thrust out, and a slip of; paper&#xD;
fluttered to the ground. 'Hubert saw it de-&#xD;

words :&#xD;

been surprised 1n the act of writing it; and&#xD;
no opportunity being given to finish te&#xD;

would be of sufficient importance to attract&#xD;

Hubert Frothingham read it several times,&#xD;
by the faint light shining, through the office-&#xD;
window. He gould not form an opinion im-&#xD;
mediately. Having committed it to memory,&#xD;
he put it'into his pocket and lingered near&#xD;
the spot where he had found it. Occasionally,&#xD;
he passed the ;window  of his- nnknow&#xD;

continued to pace to and.fro, hoping that the&#xD;
sash would be again raised and another se&#xD;

late hour, his imagination tenanted by the&#xD;
face and figure ofthe fair stranger.&#xD;
CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
THE 5A8SYJ:UM.&#xD;
Hubert Frothingham was a youn' man of&#xD;
good family. His father had. enough of this&#xD;
world's'substance to gratify every reasonable&#xD;
desire.; Hubert was 'well educated.  H Te&#xD;
gduaed withehonor at a famous institution&#xD;
He wasendowed by naturewith manynoble&#xD;
qualities, both' of head and heart. He was&#xD;
maganimous and he was brave. He was&#xD;
heal thy and he was wealthy. He had -been&#xD;
casi in no ,ungainly mold. He pad just pro-&#xD;
potions ofpersop, and i4pllectual gifts of&#xD;
ngore than average value. Having enough&#xD;
to eat, to drink, to wear, and to spend, no-&#xD;
thing, apparently, stood in the way of his,&#xD;
enjoyment. He was master of his own move,&#xD;
nents, and could follow the lead ofehisdew&#xD;
sires. His face was prepossessingM.-and, when&#xD;
animated, something more thnthat.. There'&#xD;
were times when Hubert was positively&#xD;
good-looking.. There were ladies who aetu-&#xD;
ally thought, him  handsome; but, having&#xD;
traveled, he was nqt so much flattered by&#xD;
their good opinion as he was by his own self-&#xD;
esteem.&#xD;
eHe arose in the morning, after a short and&#xD;
not very refreshing, sleep. The very first&#xD;
flush of consciousness brought to him, the&#xD;
image of the yqung lady ; nor was he averse&#xD;
to such a visitor, impalpable though it were.&#xD;
He hugged the shadow to his breast, and&#xD;
played with' the chain that enslaved him,&#xD;
Having leisure, upon his hands, he had now&#xD;
n opportunity to employ it, and to keep out&#xD;
of idle ness.&#xD;
Upon descending, helearned that the trav-&#xD;
el1ng- ctqrriage had already left the inn. Tihe&#xD;
hour being early, this. was a surprise to&#xD;
grothingham. Eating his breakfast with&#xD;

snore haste than appetite, he ordered a horse&#xD;
to be saddled, and, was soon in pursuit of the&#xD;
of ject of his admiration. Having learned&#xD;
the direction in which the vehicle had been&#xD;
driven, he was soon cantering after it. Ar-&#xD;
riving at a cross-road, he was for some time&#xD;
in'doubt; but by disniounting and making a&#xD;
close examination of 'the carriage-track, le&#xD;
definitely determined which way to go. He&#xD;
prebied forward with impatience, the miles&#xD;
slipping easily from beneath his horses' hoofs,&#xD;
bthe did not Overtake the travelers ; they&#xD;
strangely eluded him. He kept the trail with&#xD;
d56oulty, and by making inquiries of per-&#xD;
ans whom he passed or met on, the road.&#xD;
HO tound a farmhouse where they had stop-&#xD;
Od a few moments to procure some milk ;&#xD;
and the information which he received there&#xD;
respecting the country and the roads, enabled&#xD;
him to go on with greater confidence and&#xD;
courage. The day Was far advanced before&#xD;
he caught a glimpse of the vehicle, which&#xD;
was then slowly winding its way up a hill.&#xD;
He was careful to keep at a safe distance be-&#xD;
hind, and finally had the satisfaction of see-&#xD;
in the carriage stop before a large square&#xD;
building, and fn a spot so lonely that it was a&#xD;
diatter of surprise to him.&#xD;
Frothingham, having paused long enough&#xD;
to satisfy himself that the travelers had not&#xD;
made a temporary halt, rode slowly back to&#xD;
the nearest farmhouse, forming various con-&#xD;
Jecttires concerning the patties, and reading&#xD;
the unfinished note for the hundredth time.&#xD;
The singular affair grew more interesting.&#xD;
1$ was the being of a romance, and he&#xD;
resolved to' follow it to the last page. If&#xD;
wrong had been committed for any one of&#xD;
these selfish purposes that govern the actions&#xD;
of men, he had time and inclination to trace&#xD;
it to its source ; and he could think of no&#xD;
better or more pleasing employment. Had&#xD;
the young lady been put out of the question,&#xD;
it is probable that his zeal would have been&#xD;
less eager and his actions less prompt.&#xD;
He suspected the ises of the square build-&#xD;
ing ; and a few careless inquiries at the farm-&#xD;
house settled all doibt on that point. .It was&#xD;
a madhouse. It was not called a 'madhouse&#xD;
by the benevolent persons interested in' it.&#xD;
Certainly not. It was called an Asylum for&#xD;
Abnormal Persons. A very delicate anil&#xD;
genteel appellation. A few of the country-&#xD;
people had ventured to call it an Insanery ;&#xD;
a piece of irreverence which had called down&#xD;
the rebukes of the keepers, It had been&#xD;
spoken of, too, as a private hospital for -the&#xD;
insane. However, the mere wording could&#xD;
not disguise the uses of the concern.&#xD;
Frothingham was -not much surprised at&#xD;
the confirmation of his suspicions. With the&#xD;
mysterious, incomplete little note in his&#xD;
hand, he would have been extremely dull&#xD;
&#xD;
A JOY&#xD;
not to infer that an institution of that nature&#xD;
was the object of the journey.&#xD;
Having, by his frank and engaging man-&#xD;
ners, eecuted a welcome from the inmates- of&#xD;
the house, and good quarters for his weary&#xD;
horse, he waited till evening before proceed.&#xD;
ing to take a nearer view of the isolated in-&#xD;
stitution for the treatment of " abnormal per-&#xD;
sons." As he approached it, he was yet more&#xD;
impressed with its lonely situation. It was&#xD;
far from railroads and important highways.&#xD;
Was this for the quietude of the demented&#xD;
minds? Was the solitude accidental ?&#xD;
A nearer view failed to produce adore&#xD;
favorable opinions. The institution was su-&#xD;
rounded by a high wooden -fence, which&#xD;
gave it the appearance of a prison. .He&#xD;
cautiously advanced, and' at a prudent dis-&#xD;
tance made the entire circuit of the, asylum,&#xD;
observing closely every window. Some of&#xD;
the rooms were lighted, while others were&#xD;
dark.&#xD;
Hubert seated himself upon a bench be-&#xD;
neath a tree, and took counsel of himself.&#xD;
He said to himself:&#xD;
"There is a person in that house who has&#xD;
excited my curiosity and my sympathy. I&#xD;
have followed' her hither. I wish to help&#xD;
her. How shall I do it ? She will be closely,&#xD;
watched, and I must be- discreet and can&#xD;
ning.. How can I communicate with this&#xD;
young lady ? ' I will be in wait, and trust to&#xD;
Providence."                 A&#xD;
Prothingham was not in a hurry to go&#xD;
away. 'The new emotion which the lovely,&#xD;
strangerhad inspired, influenced him more&#xD;
than he' realized. So, buttoning his coat&#xD;
about him, he watched with the stars. The&#xD;
house became quiet at length. One light&#xD;
after another disappeared, The opening and&#xD;
shutting of doors, the echoes of footfalls, and&#xD;
the many signs and sounds of human activ-&#xD;
ity that give life to an inhabited dwelling,&#xD;
ceased to be heard. This was Hubert's op-&#xD;
portunity. He arose and approached the&#xD;
gate, which was a large and awkward affair,&#xD;
constructed of heavy timber. This' gate,&#xD;
Which seemed too ponderous for its uses, he&#xD;
examined with the hopewthat he might find&#xD;
means of opening it; but discovering a pad-&#xD;
lock and chain on the inside, concluded that&#xD;
entrance by- that portal was not probable.&#xD;
Having been taught from boyhood that per-&#xD;
sistency was a good thing, he thrust his arm&#xD;
through the gateand felt of the fastenings, to&#xD;
see if forgetfulness or neglect had left a sin-&#xD;
gle chance for a further prosecution of his in-&#xD;
vestigations.. It often turns out that careless-&#xD;
ness leaves open more loopholes for failure&#xD;
and discovery than the most persevering and&#xD;
prying mind can make. So it was in this&#xD;
case. The bolt had been turned; but'the key,&#xD;
by some slip of consciousness, was left in the&#xD;
&#xD;
lock. Frothingham, by a trifling effort,&#xD;
reached the key and gave it a sudden twist,&#xD;
and the work was done. Removing the pad;&#xD;
lock and chain, he pushed.open the gate and&#xD;
entered the precincts of the ;madhouse. A&#xD;
large dog came down the graveled walk to&#xD;
meet him. .Hubert was not afraid of dogs,&#xD;
but, under the circumstances, hewas sorry&#xD;
that the proprietors of that abnormal concern&#xD;
kept one ; but there was no help for it. He&#xD;
must retreat or meet the. enemy boldly. So&#xD;
he plucked up courage and Said :&#xD;
"Poor doggy !-nice doggy I"&#xD;
Doggy did not seem much flattered, but&#xD;
walked straight on.   -,&#xD;
" Good fellow  Noble canis I"&#xD;
The great fellow was willing to be a good&#xD;
fellow, a noble cans, and a poor doggy ; but&#xD;
not to sacrifice his sense of duty to flattery.&#xD;
Ile did not growl, but he .looked very digm-&#xD;
fled and firm.&#xD;
" Don't!" added Frothingham, retreating-&#xD;
"dont I I keep dogs myself !"&#xD;
Even the fact of his being a dog-holder did&#xD;
not stop cans.    ^&#xD;
" Smell of my legs and you'll smell 'em,"&#xD;
continued the intruder, resolved to use every&#xD;
lawful argument known among dogs, before&#xD;
resorting to harsher methods. The dog's&#xD;
present object was; pot to inquire about the&#xD;
strangers canine friends, but to put a stop to&#xD;
his curiosity., Instead of smelling in a truly&#xD;
investigating spirit, he cane up with busi-&#xD;
neSs-like reticence of purpose, an, quietly,&#xD;
set his teeth into the baggy part of Hubert's&#xD;
pantaloons. There was neither haste nor&#xD;
violence about this;, it was simply a matter&#xD;
of business.  It was like an ffcer's tapping&#xD;
one upon the shoulder, and saying : "You&#xD;
are my prisoner."&#xD;
" An incorruptible fellow !" laughed Froth-&#xD;
ingham, patting the dog upon his shaggy&#xD;
head. "I would give a hundred dollars for.&#xD;
you, old fellow, even though you keep .me&#xD;
here till morning."&#xD;
The young man put forth all his .dog-&#xD;
knowledge. He flattered, le coaxed, he rea-&#xD;
soned. He assured his'captor over and over&#xD;
again of his attachment to the whole canine&#xD;
family, from'the smallest ratter to the stur-&#xD;
diest mastiff. Canis listened to these -aru-&#xD;
ments. His calm courage and his insinuating&#xD;
manner of speaking, carried conviction&#xD;
through the shaggy canine knob.-. With a&#xD;
dogs .sagacity, he perceived that he had&#xD;
caught a good fellow, and began to like him.&#xD;
You may trust a dog to'know whom he likes.&#xD;
He soon discovers those persons who have a&#xD;
fondness, for his species, and there is some-&#xD;
thing in such that prevents him from hurting&#xD;
them, and disarms animosity. So this dumb&#xD;
guardian, after a time, yielded to the caresses&#xD;
of 'rthinghai sufficiently to let go of his&#xD;
&#xD;
aA TOYS                              61&#xD;
pantaloons, and to takethe subject of further&#xD;
a gressive movements into consideration.&#xD;
.he blandishments of the young man caused&#xD;
hin not only to suspend hostilities, but toac-&#xD;
cept his advances with some favor. He re.&#xD;
ceived his familiarities without resenting&#xD;
them, wagged his tail a trifle, but without&#xD;
warmth, and finally .permitted him to walk&#xD;
on, but slowly and with circumspeqtion, he&#xD;
keeping continually between him and the&#xD;
house ; a precaution which Hubert thought&#xD;
unnecessary. So far, all went well ; better&#xD;
than he had expected. He had now an op-&#xD;
portunity to look at the silent edifice at hi&#xD;
leisure. Of course, he sought for her win-&#xD;
dow. No other window interested him. He&#xD;
did not know how:he should find It, but trust-&#xD;
ed to that chance which often accomplishes&#xD;
things unexpectedly. There were now but&#xD;
two or,three lights visible, and one of' these,&#xD;
he conjectured, might shine from her a ~ rt-&#xD;
ment, These windows were neither shaded&#xD;
nor curtained, but they were latticed with&#xD;
iron rods. The thought of their uses gave&#xD;
him tinpleasent:feelings. He could not con-&#xD;
template those tell-tale bars without sad-&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
A lost mind is nore melancholy than a lost&#xD;
body. Among all the world's wrecks the&#xD;
most mournful is a wrecked intellect.&#xD;
Had he fallen in love -with one of those&#xD;
wrecked intellects while it was drifting past&#xD;
him ? Possibly; but he doubted the girl's in-&#xD;
sanity.&#xD;
Considerable time elapsed before Hubert's&#xD;
vigil was rewarded ; but patience, that car-,&#xD;
dinal virtue, :by and by made him ample&#xD;
amends for his watching and danger. One of&#xD;
the windows, that which had been dimmest,&#xD;
suddenly became illuminated. , A light had&#xD;
obviously been placed near it. In this bright-&#xD;
ness appeared a form that he immediately&#xD;
recognized, and which he was never, never&#xD;
to forget. He beheld before him, not far dis-&#xD;
tant, the heroine of the Golden Robin, whose&#xD;
name and history he was so anxious to learn.&#xD;
At sight of this gratifying'vision, he started&#xD;
forward with such. eagerness that his canine&#xD;
monitor made a low, warning sound, some-&#xD;
what down in his che4.&#xD;
"Don't be a fool, Carlo t" muttered Froth-&#xD;
ingham. "I can't take anything-can I "&#xD;
Carlo, sitting upon his haunches, with his&#xD;
long, bushy tail lying straight andmotionless&#xD;
upon the ground, his long ears hanging to his&#xD;
throat, the top of his large head on a level&#xD;
with his back, his nose, thoughtfully 'de-&#xD;
pressed, -and his eyes speculatively down-&#xD;
cast, answered never a word to this reason-&#xD;
able inquiry.&#xD;
"It' nothing but a girl, and we're all fond&#xD;
of 'em, you know," quoth Hubert, fawning&#xD;
rather abjectly, I must confess, upon the dog.&#xD;

A JOY.&#xD;
&#xD;
03                             SIBYLL&#xD;
"You don't think I can get her through those&#xD;
bars, do youI" he continued, manipulating&#xD;
the unresponsive poll of Carlo. " Come, Sir,&#xD;
be reasonable, and you shall go home with&#xD;
me to breakfast."&#xD;
The knobby head looked doubtful about&#xD;
that ; hut the young adventurer, taking sil-&#xD;
ence for assent, moved forward till he reach-&#xD;
ed an easy angle of incidence to the window.&#xD;
There was a trifling remonstrance on the part&#xD;
of Carlo, who seemed somewhat in doubt con-&#xD;
serning the line of duty.  o  h   p-&#xD;
SFrothngham had heard of throwing peb-&#xD;
bles against panes, to attract the attention of&#xD;
fair. lady ; so he groped for some pebble-&#xD;
stones, and, finding some small ones, threw&#xD;
them.  Some of the first ones 'came back&#xD;
without touching, but, after a little practice,&#xD;
he succeeded in striking the grating, and fin-&#xD;
ally, the window. The expedient was en-&#xD;
tirely successful.&#xD;
The young.girl, as if conscious that some&#xD;
one was making signals to her from without,&#xD;
shaded her eyes with her hands in her en-&#xD;
deavor to see objects from below; and, failing&#xD;
in this, moved the light and tried again, with&#xD;
different results. Frothingham placed him-&#xD;
self in the most favorable position, waved his&#xD;
handkerchief, and held up the slip of paper&#xD;
which he had received from her on the pre-&#xD;
vious night. The captive saw both the hand-&#xD;
kerchief and the paper, for the night was&#xD;
silvery with light. Certainit is that the&#xD;
maiden's heart throbbed faster for what she.&#xD;
saw., She thrilled with the thought that&#xD;
Providence had sent her a friend. - She re-&#xD;
membered the face beneath, ;upturned and&#xD;
bathed in the starry whiteness. She pro-&#xD;
duced from somewhere, I know not where,&#xD;
the flimsiest little handkerchief in the world,&#xD;
and held it up to the panes. It was to Hubert&#xD;
like the fluttering of a white dove's wing.&#xD;
That was a!messenger of peace to Hubert.&#xD;
It was the very spirit of love descending upon&#xD;
him. , His sensations were of a kind never&#xD;
before experienced. He was enamored of a&#xD;
beautiful girl, and this- was the beginning of&#xD;
favor. He was so elated, and there was such&#xD;
a premise of happiness in the heavenly bow,&#xD;
of expectation, that he Was ready to hug the&#xD;
moody Carlo, as a token of perpetual am-&#xD;
nesty.That quadruped, having resumed his&#xD;
sittiig,tipped his head a little, and listened&#xD;
dogmatically, ;blinking now at the grated&#xD;
window, and now at his charge beside him ;&#xD;
not quite able, with all his canine claifvoy-&#xD;
ance, to quite understand the meaning and&#xD;
the moral of the scene. He knew, however,&#xD;
that ie, was the hub and the centre of the'&#xD;
whole thing, and that it would stop did he&#xD;
not permit it to go on out of sheer conde-&#xD;
scension.&#xD;
The parties were face to face. One wad' a&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
prisoner above, the other was a prlepner be.&#xD;
low. The object to be attained was intelligi-&#xD;
ble communication to    be accomplished !&#xD;
They stood- and looked at each other. lie&#xD;
was not very fully revealed ; b'uit the young&#xD;
girl, standing in a focus of light, was a fair&#xD;
target for his admiring eyes. He made a&#xD;
motion for her to raise the window.. She&#xD;
made the attempt at once, but it was fastened&#xD;
as he feared. Then he began to devise some-&#xD;
thing else.  While he was devising, she&#xD;
caught an inspiration and outstripped him.&#xD;
The flash of her diamond ring flashed that&#xD;
inspiration into her mind. Instantly she had&#xD;
one of the sharp points of the diamond&#xD;
against a pane, and was cutting into its hard,&#xD;
surface as if it were soft metal. . Hubert sawf&#xD;
her hand traveling in a little circle, and won-&#xD;
dered what she was doing. By-and-by he&#xD;
saw that same girlish hand strike .upon the&#xD;
pane, when a small wheel of glass leaped&#xD;
through the lattice and fell, at his feet. It&#xD;
made some noise in falling, but disturbed no&#xD;
one apparently. Carlo, however, suspected&#xD;
that his goodness was being abused, and look-&#xD;
ed suspiciously at Frdthingham, who picked&#xD;
up the glass,-his circulation considerably&#xD;
quipkened by expectation. Holding the dia-&#xD;
phanous circle toward the light,,.he-perceived&#xD;
some characters were written u on it with&#xD;
the sharp facet of p diamond,   here were&#xD;
the letters plowed delicately into the clear&#xD;
substance, but he could not read them easily.&#xD;
He turned the glass to various angles with&#xD;
the moon, and, finally, with much straining&#xD;
of the eyes, read :&#xD;
.faqgnua Drake,&#xD;
Attorney-at-Law.&#xD;
Below these words were some fainter lines&#xD;
that he could not decipher. Although glad&#xD;
to receive this communication, it must be&#xD;
confessed .that it did not convey a definite&#xD;
idea to his mind. He was disappointed. He&#xD;
wished to know the name of the young lady,&#xD;
her history and condition. He held up his&#xD;
left hand andh wrote upon It, in pantomime -&#xD;
with the other. Immediately she produced&#xD;
a slip of paper andsbegan to write with a&#xD;
pencil. All was now going Well; -but acci-&#xD;
dent, which is sometimes a roaring lion, in-&#xD;
terrupted the silent proceedings, and marred&#xD;
for the time the plot. In stepping backward&#xD;
to obtain a better view of the pretty figure,&#xD;
-he stepped upon a rolling stone, lost his bal-&#xD;
ance, and fell against a semi-circular flower-&#xD;
stand, heavily freighted with flower-pots.&#xD;
There was a grand crash. The earth and&#xD;
vases, With their various plants and shrubs,&#xD;
were precipitated to the ground with a clat-&#xD;
tering 'that was truly - startling.  These&#xD;
arrangements had no sooner gone to -the dogs&#xD;
than half a dozen windows on the lower&#xD;
&#xD;
SIBYLL&#xD;
floor flew open, .and as many night-capped&#xD;
heads were thrust out in inquiring haste.&#xD;
Hubert Frothingham did not stop for&#xD;
farther developments, but patting Carlo by&#xD;
way of a peace-offering, hurried from the&#xD;
yard. The dog, with unexpected good-fel-'&#xD;
lowship, followed him, and they left the&#xD;
premises together.&#xD;
CHAPTER. XXI.&#xD;
GonDoN's.&#xD;
On the following day, Frothingham in-&#xD;
quired about the hunting and the fishing&#xD;
privileges, and finding them desirable, imme-&#xD;
diately dispatched a note to a college-friend,&#xD;
requesting him to come to him at once, for a&#xD;
few days of sporting and rural enjoyment.&#xD;
Frank Southerly was a young gentleman&#xD;
of equal expectations, and in close fellowship&#xD;
with Hubert. They had manly faith in each&#xD;
other, and mutual confidences had given&#xD;
mutual grounds for that faith. Placed as he&#xD;
was, Frothingham desired the advice and&#xD;
co-operation of Southerly. The novelty of,&#xD;
his present undertaking afforded a certain&#xD;
measure of excitement, but-it was not un-&#xD;
mingled with doubt and uneasiness. His&#xD;
friend had some experience and was fruitful&#xD;
in expedients ; and 'in that restless state of&#xD;
mind in which he found himself, he believed&#xD;
that Frank would be a suitable and success-&#xD;
ful diplomatist.&#xD;
' Hubert went home 'with a bit of glass in&#xD;
his pocket and a large dog at his heels. The,&#xD;
bit of glass had information upon its surface,&#xD;
and the'large dog had information beneath&#xD;
the surface of his shaggy head. The young&#xD;
man had about as much comprehension of&#xD;
one as of the other. The writing was quite&#xD;
as obscure as the intentions of Carlo. He,&#xD;
looked at it again and again, after he had re-&#xD;
tired to the little bedroom assigned him by&#xD;
the hospitable farmer. It still read:&#xD;
Magnus Drake,&#xD;
Attorney-at-Law&#xD;
The lines beneath these words remained as&#xD;
indistinct and unintelligible as when looked&#xD;
at by the light of the shimmering moon-&#xD;
beams. The diamond point 'had evidently&#xD;
slipped, and whatever else she ,had intended&#xD;
to write was lost. He added this name to&#xD;
the unfinished note, and the meaning was yet&#xD;
incomplete ; for where should he look for&#xD;
Magnus Drake ? There was such a person&#xD;
in the world, doubtless ; but the world is a&#xD;
pretty large place to look over. It was&#xD;
rather discouraging to search for Magnus&#xD;
Drake in so wide a field. Love itself might&#xD;
tire with a search so extended.&#xD;
He retired to rest long after midnight, with&#xD;
his mind teeming with images of the fair&#xD;
&#xD;
,I&#xD;
&#xD;
A JOY.                              ;8&#xD;
lunatic. Her beautiful face was set in his&#xD;
dreams, and .her lovely person danced&#xD;
through his Imagination like a 'syiphide.&#xD;
Arising at a late. hour in the morning, and&#xD;
raising the little white curtain to let i the&#xD;
golden beams of day, the first object he saw&#xD;
was the nose of Carlo pressed against. the&#xD;
pane of the low window, watching for his&#xD;
-new master., Hubert could not help smiling&#xD;
The eccentric behavior of Carlo amused,&#xD;
while, at thesame time, it pleased him.&#xD;
" Ah l" said he, " I am a dog-charmer."&#xD;
He raised the window, a id putting out a&#xD;
soft, white hand, conveyed his matutinal&#xD;
greetings to his new ally, who received them&#xD;
with dignity and satisfaction, and put his&#xD;
two, large paws upon the sill, wishing to&#xD;
enter. Being flattered by the predilection of&#xD;
this prince of dogs, Hubert pushed up the&#xD;
window to its full capacity, and permitted&#xD;
him to come_ in. He made his debut with&#xD;
one strong bound. He sat upon his haunches&#xD;
while Frothingham was-writing his pressing&#xD;
invitation to Southerly, and seemed well con-&#xD;
tent with our hero's society. Hubert, talked&#xD;
to him as if there were knowledge in that&#xD;
serious head. Heasked him if he were not&#xD;
a trifle surly on the previous night, and wish-&#xD;
ed to know his opinion of the young lady at&#xD;
the window. Did he think she was crazy?&#xD;
Did he think she ought to be there? Would&#xD;
he go -up with him to see her ? Would he&#xD;
carry a note to her? yogs had carried notes.&#xD;
So had pigeons. At any rate, they would&#xD;
have some pleasant walks together.&#xD;
To all this Bow Wow wagged assent.&#xD;
Thus was rapport established between man&#xD;
and dog. They breakfasted together, with&#xD;
much politeness on the part of Hubert, and&#xD;
much.decorum on the part of Carlo.&#xD;
Farmer ,Gordon, Mrs. Gordon, and the lit-&#xD;
tle Gordons, were delighted with, the acqui-&#xD;
sitions to their household. Both man and&#xD;
dog were popular with the little folks, who&#xD;
declared that the character of the latter had&#xD;
suddenly changed for the better,, as he was&#xD;
wont to be exceedingly churlish up at the&#xD;
large house. Mrs. Gordon, who was a sen-&#xD;
sible woman, firmed,. after Fi-othingham&#xD;
had gone out to look at the farn with her&#xD;
husband, that dogs instinctively knew good-&#xD;
hearted people; and that a man who is fond&#xD;
of dogs would be fond of his wife ; and, for&#xD;
her part,- she would rather have a sagacious&#xD;
dog select a husband for h'er than a match-&#xD;
making mamma.&#xD;
"That young follow," quoth Mrs. Gordon,&#xD;
"will be a favorite among the ladies. And&#xD;
did you notice, M~atilda"--Matilda was the&#xD;
oldest dughter-4, what small feet and hands&#xD;
he had? His hands are white enough, I&#xD;
hope ? But a lad can't have white hands&#xD;
and work on a farm. Bless you, Ma. Gor=&#xD;

don never had white hands in lils lifb; but&#xD;
he's' been a good husband for all that. I&#xD;
shouldn't wonder if this Mr.-t''    Sr-&#xD;
"Frothitighan," prompted Matilda.&#xD;
".W s deed in loVe "with somebody up to&#xD;
the Ilmanerj."&#xD;
"' I 'think .so  Mo !"' said Matilda, with a'&#xD;
slightly eonteipiuous jerk of his head. "He&#xD;
wouldn't go wanderingabbut, in the night if;&#xD;
he hacln't'got somebody in his eye."&#xD;
" He acts just as yotir father did, Matil-'&#xD;
da, when he lbst saw me," replied Mrs. Gor-&#xD;
don, with simplicity. "They said he 'rasi&#xD;
dreadful ubsejt-minded likd in, those dayss"&#xD;
"Was you pretty, mother "&#xD;
"I don't know, child; your father -thought,&#xD;
I was. Leastwise, he =aid so, and he did talk&#xD;
a good deal of nonsense,'dear ; and I was silly'&#xD;
enough to hear him, and to-grow fond of him.'&#xD;
Now,'I suppose, if he had told, me that I was&#xD;
sensible and 'homely, that 'nothing would&#xD;
have come of 'our courtship. Men don't mar-,&#xD;
ry girls altogether for their intellect, I sup-&#xD;
pose, but for something that Is womanly&#xD;
about them, that can't be told or described,&#xD;
nor scarcely'known by'any name. Don't be&#xD;
strong-minded, my'dear, but'be a woman."&#xD;
" He wouldn't go and fall in love with a&#xD;
lunatic, would he, mother ?" Matilda asked,&#xD;
naively.&#xD;
"Bless you, child love is an accident ! It&#xD;
is as much' an accident as being run over&#xD;
by the cars, and is sometimes about as sud-&#xD;
den."&#xD;
"Dear me I" murmured Matilda.      " I&#xD;
thought it was a pleasant thing."&#xD;
"It's pleasant enough, for that matter;"&#xD;
answered Mrs. Gordon, keeping quietly about&#xD;
her work; "but it isn't so 'comfortable at&#xD;
first, when people don't know  how they&#xD;
stand, and how the yes and no :question is.&#xD;
And sometimes a girl don't know her ,own&#xD;
mind, that's a fact. When a girl don't knowI&#xD;
her own mind, she must be worked round&#xD;
careful, and not hurried; for if you hurry'&#xD;
her, you'lose her. When the thihg is mutual,&#xD;
why, of course, it is different, and those two&#xD;
people are ready-to fly into each other's arms&#xD;
at the first opportunity, unless," added'Mrs.&#xD;
Gordonuprudently, "she should be coquettish&#xD;
and play shy, just to bring him out, and make&#xD;
hind fonder of her, and more earnest. , But it's&#xD;
best, dear, not to carry that sort of thing too&#xD;
far ; for some fellows are impatient, and so&#xD;
blind that they can't see love in aroguish eye.&#xD;
But a proud girl, once caught, she's as 'gentlir&#xD;
as a' dove. As I was sa 'g, this young man&#xD;
has something 'on his mi,'; and if itin't a&#xD;
young woman, I am gre    mistakened."&#xD;
"1Perhaps he has got rdlations in that terri-&#xD;
ble house," suggested Matilda.&#xD;
"Heaven pity them if he has !" said Mrs.&#xD;
Gordon, shaking her head.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Perhaps he's insane -himselfW, observed&#xD;
the girl.&#xD;
"One kind of insanity," returned the&#xD;
mother. "That kind which comes of itself,&#xD;
and goes whentit-pleases, and does not depend&#xD;
on the state of the body. He will not go away&#xD;
in a hurry. ,{e spoke to me of staying some&#xD;
time, and of having a friend, coning to see&#xD;
him."&#xD;
"I shouldn't wonder if the two should carry&#xD;
the crazy lady off.",&#xD;
All persons are not mad who are sent to&#xD;
madhouses,"' returned Mrs. Gordon, with&#xD;
emphasis; "I've known peopleto be shut up&#xD;
in asylums, who could not, from the very na-&#xD;
ture of their -organizaions, be insane. I knew&#xD;
a man who seat his wife to an. Insanery, be.&#xD;
cause she discovered n, disgraceful intrigue&#xD;
carried on under her very nose, and involv.&#xD;
ing the reputation of a, bright young girl.&#xD;
Well, she went among the unfortunate ones,&#xD;
and she can tell you how folks are treated by&#xD;
hirelings who have authority, and can do as&#xD;
they please without regard to justice, decency.&#xD;
or the common' claims of humanity. If our&#xD;
friends won't take care of us when we're out&#xD;
of our mind, strangers won't. Do not expect&#xD;
of strangers what you do not expect of friends.&#xD;
Doctors are good enough and sensible enough,&#xD;
but they're apt to become careless and har.&#xD;
dened, and ;impenetrable to the outcries of&#xD;
human nature. A doctor is a -being who is&#xD;
case-hardened by the contemplation of pain&#xD;

don, pausing in her work,, and lowering her&#xD;
voice, "that he is as cruel as a tiger, and&#xD;

SIBYIEL&#xD;
- CH APTER XXIL,-&#xD;
CARLO'S DOOR.-&#xD;
Upon that day, Herbert Frothingham saw&#xD;
he traveling-carriage which had conveyed&#xD;
the young lady to the hospital pass the farm-&#xD;
house, on its return to the lace frim whetice&#xD;
it came. It, then, contained but two persons&#xD;
-=the middle-aged' lady and the gentleman&#xD;
with the sinister face. The thought at once&#xD;
occurred to Frothingtoin toshave the vehicle&#xD;
followed. But'Whom should he employ for&#xD;
such a.purpose ? Gordon's son was too young&#xD;
to be trusted with such an undertaking, and&#xD;
his hired man was evidently'not acute enough&#xD;
for such a business. He .took Gordon aside,&#xD;
and made known his wishes. Gordon, being&#xD;
a very sensible and discerning person, imme-&#xD;
diatefy offered hi' services, provided Froth-&#xD;
ingham thought him a suitable agent for an&#xD;
employment requiring no little tact and pru-&#xD;
dence.,-7&#xD;
"That a great wrong .has been done to a&#xD;
certain person," saicd Herbert; "I have not&#xD;
the slightest doubt. In my opinion, the per-&#xD;
sons who have committed, and are continuing&#xD;
that wrong; are in that carriage."&#xD;
"It would not be the first time,?' observed&#xD;
Gordon, " that wrong has been done up yon-&#xD;
der, through the agency of Doctor Brooks."&#xD;
"It is not only the duty of every honest&#xD;
man, but the privilege,.to ferret but acts of&#xD;
perfidy and injustice ; ayd -having time, in-&#xD;
clination, and means, I 4m going to. make a&#xD;
mysterious subject clear and manifest, and&#xD;
give plotting villainy its due reward. I shall,&#xD;
gratefully accept-your friendly offer. Saddle'&#xD;
your best horse, Mr.. Gordon, and follow&#xD;
yonder carriage.. I will make such amends&#xD;
for your'absence as money can make."&#xD;
" As for money," answered Gordon, cheer-&#xD;
fully, " I have no pressing need -of- it, being&#xD;
comfortably cared for, so far as the world's&#xD;
wants are concerned. I suppose that you.&#xD;
will not like your agent less if he has in this&#xD;
service a higher incentive than money ; and&#xD;
to see that concern- leveled with the dust, I&#xD;
would keep in. the saddle not only a day, but&#xD;
a week."    ,&#xD;
Frothingham  expressed his thanks with&#xD;
waimth, while the practical Gordon ordered&#xD;
his man to bring the horse ready to mount,&#xD;
and went into the house., In fifteen minutes,&#xD;
he was trotting after the carriage, and Froth-&#xD;
ingham felt that he had secured a valuable;&#xD;
assistanta&#xD;
That night, he again visited the scene of&#xD;
his recent adventures. He approached the&#xD;
gate with more cautiousness than on the pre-&#xD;
vious occasion. This time the key was no$&#xD;
left in the lock. That carelessness had not&#xD;
been repeated ; a circumstance that dl&amp;amp;not&#xD;
surprise him, as he expected, after the dis-&#xD;
turbance of the $revious: night, more vigi-&#xD;

lance would' be observed to keep out 'In-&#xD;
truders. S&#xD;
Carlo, still satisfied with his adopted mas-&#xD;
ter, walked contentedlyy beside him. Find,&#xD;
ing himself forced to remains on the wrong&#xD;
side of the paling,:he threw himself upon&#xD;
patience' and philosophy,'and made his ob-&#xD;
servations at a safe distance. As a matter of&#xD;
course,; the- window where he had seen the&#xD;
fair face and figure was 'the special object of&#xD;
his attention. TVhere was a feeble light there&#xD;
to guide his gaze, That light was the star of&#xD;
his hopes. It threw its pale rays upon the&#xD;
woman that he loved. Youthful enthusiasm&#xD;
painted her in beautiful colors. She glowed&#xD;
beneath his fond imagination till she -was lit-&#xD;
tle less bright than an angel.&#xD;
The thing called-love is full of absurdities,&#xD;
when looked at by the ~merely worldly and&#xD;
practical eye; but it is true to itself and its&#xD;
:causes, and is not so much a matter of chance&#xD;
as of fate. The ocean of life is full of eddies&#xD;
and -under-tows, which set strongly toward&#xD;
matrimony. ' The.d eddies and undertows,&#xD;
seizing men and women, hurry them toward&#xD;
the vortex with irresistible force. Hubert&#xD;
had fallen into an eddy, and was drifting on&#xD;
rapidly. He was ready to incur any risk to&#xD;
'stand' once. more face to face Witl the fair&#xD;
young creature who had bewitched him. He&#xD;
could not sit there and look idly at the win-&#xD;
dow-panes. To attain, one must work.&#xD;
Would 'she not expect him    to return ?&#xD;
Would she not watch for an opportunity to&#xD;
communicate with him? 'The answer was&#xD;
obvious.&#xD;
He looked at the paling. Palings were not&#xD;
impregnable. Palings were made of wood,&#xD;
and wood was assailable by simple means.&#xD;
He began an examinationof the streieth of&#xD;
the inclosure. While thus employed,'arlo&#xD;
suddenly disappeared.  He looked to -see&#xD;
.what had become of him, and discovered a&#xD;
hole by which he had crawled through the&#xD;
paling. The aperture was not ,of recent&#xD;
origin, and was evidently the worli of Carlo,&#xD;
having been made patly by digging and&#xD;
partly by tearing off.the wood with his teeth.&#xD;
"Here is an opening," said Frothirgham&#xD;
to himself, "riot only tor Carlo, but for. me.&#xD;
If love is aspiring, it is also groveling. Carlo&#xD;
can crawl through to get a bone ; 1'can go&#xD;
through to get a sight of a lovely face.'&#xD;
Frothingham. hesitated.  He had, some&#xD;
qualms.of pride about accepting Carlo's door.&#xD;
If Carlo-could make a door, couldn't he make&#xD;
a better one ? Full of this idea, he started off&#xD;
in search of a lever. He was lucky enough&#xD;
to find a stout limb, straight, and of sufficient&#xD;
length.' Armed with this simple ,form  of&#xD;
power, he returned,; and, by, putting one end&#xD;
into .Carlo's door, soon loosened a pale, whih,&#xD;

was ht'ngry, which was a good sign ; and,&#xD;
feeling that food was necessa-y to sustain&#xD;
her, took a cracker froin the side-board and&#xD;
ate it. It had a healthful sweetness to her&#xD;
taste.  Wile she was eating it, she saw&#xD;
something lying upon the floor. Perceiving&#xD;
that it was a letter, she stooped and picked it&#xD;
up. Letters'seemed to be the order of the&#xD;
morning. This 'was directed .to .Richard&#xD;
Parkhurst, and it lay, with a napkin, under&#xD;
the" table, where it had accidentally fallen.&#xD;
Sibylla put it into her pocket and left the&#xD;
dining-room.    She walked cjuickly ' to Ste.&#xD;
phens room, and listenedat the door. Hear-&#xD;
ug. no sound, 'she entered. - The apartment&#xD;
'was without an occupant.&#xD;
" Ah I" thought Sibylla, " Richard -has not&#xD;
the courage to occupy this room, or to sleep&#xD;
up on this bed. His dreams would be haunt-&#xD;
ed by'Stephen, and his miserable conscience&#xD;
would bring spectres to his pillow.,"&#xD;
' Having.noiselessly-locked the door; she sat&#xD;
dowh in Stephen's chair, and read! the letter&#xD;
directed to 1Iichai-d.&#xD;

'iThis significant epistle threw yet more&#xD;
light upon the designs of Richard Parkhurst.&#xD;
It was an important lihk in the chain of evi-&#xD;
dence. She resolved:to preserve it carefully.&#xD;
A  lappy thought occur l tolher ; she would'&#xD;
inclose it, with a letter of her own, to Mag-&#xD;
nus Drake. She lost no time in hesitation,&#xD;
but, sitting down to her guardian's desk,&#xD;
wtote:&#xD;
"DEAR FRIEND :-Things are going badly 'here. I&#xD;

us. I fear something serious has happened to you.&#xD;

as it would seem, fatal Incident. Proof is now in my&#xD;

ed to arrive at twelve o'clock. At that hour some-&#xD;
thinig did arrive. A long and heavy box was delivered&#xD;
quietly at theeside-door, and brought into the house by,&#xD;
men, whose tiv movements- and shuffling feet, as&#xD;
heard by me from my cncdalment, plainly indicated&#xD;
that their burden was not light. I heard the reading&#xD;
of wood and-the starting of nails. I an too.weak now&#xD;
to write thedetails. eAn enpty b  iwastcarried Into&#xD;

with straw and bottles. While those persons weten&#xD;

Parkhurst's room, lying u on Stephen Parkhurst's&#xD;
bed. For this assertion I' ave the evidence -of -my&#xD;
eyes and the conviotions~of my judgment.&#xD;
Now tell me, dar Sir, what I am to think of all&#xD;
this ? Was ever anything so distracting, and so mixed&#xD;
with light Sand darkness? low can I help feeling a&#xD;
thrilling inspiration of hope? and-yet the mere human&#xD;
will could attempt a plot so complicated, and involv-&#xD;
ing such ci el consequences. But my guardian was&#xD;
not cruel. ,iTo me he was al' entleness. I am.aware,&#xD;
however, that hishatred of Richard was intense. He&#xD;
despisedthee low ani vagrant villain who lived byy les&#xD;
anits, and Ib -ought disgrace upon, his kindred. - Youer&#xD;
dislike of him, I am sure, was no less. Yon and he&#xD;

think I am getting wild in my expressions, I should&#xD;
like to ask you, it Stephen Parkhurst died, what be-&#xD;
come of Norman Drew's body, which arrived at;mid-&#xD;
night ? Was it buried in the cellar? Was it bidden&#xD;
between the floors ? Was it sent to. the surgeon's ?&#xD;
Was it carried to the deadhouse, to receive a pau-&#xD;
per's burial? Answer if you can.&#xD;
" Should this reach you, your good sense willbetter&#xD;

-aving carefully directed her letter, her&#xD;
tiext thought was to procure a trusty mes-&#xD;
senger. Going to the front.of the yet quiet&#xD;
house, she opened a window, hailed the first&#xD;
lad who came down the avenue, and filling&#xD;
his hand with silver pieces, soon had the&#xD;
pleasure of seeing   his nimble feet hurry&#xD;
away with boyish eagerness to perform her&#xD;
important errand. S1e closed the window&#xD;
with a sigh of satisfaction and relief.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
AN AMBUSH.&#xD;
Sibylla returned to the apartment which&#xD;
she had left, sustained by a strength that&#xD;
was surprising. ' Recent- experiences had&#xD;
taught her to move quietly, and to depend&#xD;
more upon her -own efforts than upon others.&#xD;
Soon after entering the room     rendered :so&#xD;
sacred ,by forfaer associations, .she became&#xD;
conscious that one of the adjoining rooms&#xD;
was occupied. She heard voices ; mascu-&#xD;
line tones, that presently gregy louder and&#xD;
more distinct. Sibyll had learned to be a&#xD;
good listener. ' Cunning was her line of de-&#xD;
fence ;, and, from what has been spen of her&#xD;
character, it will be understood that no op-&#xD;
portunity of surprising tile secnets - of her&#xD;
enemies would be neglected. In a mpiment,&#xD;
she had placed a hassock upon ,the carpet,&#xD;
seated herself upon it, and put her ear to the&#xD;
Wall., , There was a; door cpmmunicating&#xD;
with the room, but Stephen Parkhursts be,&#xD;
had been moved against it, Richard being&#xD;
afraid of Stephen's ghost, and having a su-&#xD;
perstitious tenor of that apartment..- She&#xD;
was, nQt kept long in doubt respecting the&#xD;
parties engaged in conversation   One was&#xD;
Richard, unquestionably, and the otfier', she&#xD;
readily decided was the person referred to&#xD;
