               <p>MANY a one who reads these pages, may have watched as I, the constant ebb and
                  flow, or rather the counter currents of humanity, which sweep along
                     <emph>the</emph> street of all streets in New York—BROADWAY? Perhaps some may
                  have seen as I, at other hours, when <emph>Fashion</emph> has retired to its
                  gilded halls, or <emph>mock</emph> Fashion to its attics and its basements,
                  characters, which once brilliant, had sunk from their glory into a darkness which
                  made the hours of night the only day for them.</p>
               <p>And some perchance have watched the gold-worshippers of Wall street who would
                  barter their souls with Satan if the price was high, and a chance for a rise in
                  stock.</p>
               <p>And some may have watched the Christian who kneels on satin cushions in his pew on
                  Sundays, but who scorns to see the poor or humble there or elsewhere on any day,
                  and whose religion is never seen <emph>outside</emph> of the church in which he
                  holds the foremost pew—the Pharisee of modern days.</p>
               <p>Well, good watchers all, you may find some old acquaintances if you but follow me
                  in my inky path, for I draw my pictures from real life. Of my
                     <emph>heroine,</emph> I say nothing, she must speak for herself!</p>
               <p>The mansion was in the Fifth Avenue—few millionaires would live elsewhere, without
                  they were <emph>Astor's</emph> or some of those old Knickerbockers who so love
                  their Dutch ancestry, that nothing can drive them from the homestead where their
                  forefathers sold codfish, or traded in crockery, hardware and dry-goods, all at
                  once.</p>
               <p>And it was a grand one—pure marble front—even if the marble was but thin and well
                  backed by brick. Grand in appearance inside and outside—furnished as New York
                  Princes know how to furnish their <emph>Republican</emph> palaces.</p>
               <p>And a grand old gentleman was its owner, Mr. Linden Van Linden—in his own opinion
                  at any rate, also in the opinion of most who knew that his check was worth a
                  million on sight in Wall street, for he was supposed to be as high in the mighty
                  temple of gold as the highest.</p>
               <p>Look at him as he steps from his carriage coming home to dine at five, his
                  business hours and cares past. For with all of his wealth in hand, he yet studies
                  and labors harder and harder to increase it—harder than any poor laborer toils for
                  the daily bread which must keep <emph>him</emph> from starvation.</p>
               <p>Look at him if you please, as he pauses a moment, before he walks up the marble
                  steps.</p>
               <p>White haired—yet not old looking—his face pale and cold as the marble before
                  him—his eyes grey, keen and searching—his features rather of the Roman cast, his
                  form stout, yet not plethoric; you see in him a man of decision, inflexibility,
                  and also of<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC6970-00000003"/>
                  <emph>pride</emph>. He carries a gold-headed case in his hand—he does not seem to
                  need it to steady his yet sturdy form—his dress is as fashionable as
                  possible—diamond studs glitter in his shirt bosom—a diamond upon his finger would
                  buy all the country members of a legislature, distant not more than one hundred
                  and fifty-four miles from New York city—at least its value would upon any city
                  question. And all this is an evidence that he is proud of himself, and the wealth
                  which no enables him to adorn himself and to show to the world that he is not like
                  Andy Johnson, "our most noble Vice," a <emph>plebian</emph>.</p>
               <p>But look—a frown is upon the brow of Mr. Linden Van Linden.</p>
               <p>He sees a picture. Yes two of them. One, a girl of eighteen years—fairly opening
                  from the bud of girlhood into the full bloom of womanly perfection, so far as
                  beauty of form and face unite. She stands by the just-opened door, grasping the
                  hand of a man at least ten years her senior. You cannot see much of his face, for
                  it is covered with a glossy beard of jetty black. But you can see an aquiline
                  nose, and above it, under heavy eyebrows a pair of those dangerous, glittering
                  black eyes, of which romantic, brigand-loving girls had better beware. He is
                  dressed superbly—diamonds glitter upon his person, or jewels which look like
                  diamonds. He bows low, kisses the hand of the lovely young girl—then, she with a
                  half-smothered shriek, cries—</p>
               <p>"My father! he must not see us so!"</p>
               <p>—He turns, ceremoniously bows and walks calmly down the steps.</p>
               <p>He <choice>
                     <sic>passess</sic>
                     <corr>passes</corr>
                  </choice> Mr. Linden Van Linden as if he knew him not, nor cared to know him.</p>
               <p>The latter looks after him but a moment, as he walks nonchalantly down the street,
                  and then he darts up those marble steps with an agility which his sixty years—ah
                  how thoughtless to betray his age—would hardly be supposed capable of.</p>
               <p>The young girl, who but a moment before had been radiant with the sun of joy
                     <unclear>beaming</unclear> from her face, now stood pale and
                     <unclear>trembling</unclear> as he approached.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Magdalena!</emph>" said he, his voice husky, and tremulous as well, though
                  his cold grey eye emitted no unusual light—"Magdalena, who was that man who just
                  left you and passed me as I stood by the carriage? Speak, girl, for I allow no
                  strangers to <emph>me,</emph> to visit <emph>you!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Father!" replied the young girl, her color beginning to return to her cheeks—"You
                  certainly are not offended when my music teacher comes to give me my afternoon
                  lessons! The gentleman who passed you was Senor Desmondo, my teacher upon the harp
                  and guitar. I do not knew as you have met him before, but he was well recommended,
                  and you know you left it to mo to select my own teachers!"</p>
               <p>"A music teacher, and wearing <emph>diamonds?</emph>" said Mr. Linden Van Linden
                  with sarcasm in the tone of his enquiry.</p>
               <p>"Diamonds, father? Ah yes, I believe he wears some, heir-looms from his family,
                  once wealthy in Spain. But he is poor, very poor, and has to teach music for a
                  living!" said Magdalena, now quite calm.</p>
               <p>"Poor, and wears diamonds! That is devilish nonsense! or, worse, it is criminal! A
                  poor man has no right to wear the insignia of the rich. But another question,
                  Magdalena, and one to be answered without prevarication! What else does he teach,
                  or try to teach, besides music?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing dear father, that I know of!"</p>
               <p>"You err, girl—you err, and you are trying to deceive your old father. That man
                  has been teaching, or trying to teach you the art of Love. I saw him kiss your
                  hand before either of you knew that I was near. Can you deny that?"</p>
               <p>"No Sir!" replied Magdalena—"but he always does that when he leaves me—he says
                  that it is the custom of his country! I am sure he meant only respect!"</p>
               <p>"He will do it no more, nor will he again visit my house!" said Mr. Van Linden.
                  "You will at once send him a note, dismissing him as your teacher, and if he
                  wishes to know <emph>why,</emph> refer him to me. I will have no foreign vagabonds
                  practising the customs of their country under my roof. Remember, Magdalena, that
                  you are my only child—the image of the only being I ever loved on earth but you,
                  the image of your mother as she was when at your very age, I, even then an old
                  man, wooed and won her. You are all that I have, all, <emph>all!</emph>"</p>
               <p>And the old man's grey eyes were moist as he spoke, and his thin lips quivered,
                  and a flush came out upon the marble of his face, like a ray of sun-light falling
                  on the head of a statue.</p>
               <p>"Father I will do as you wish, though I know the poor man meant no harm!" said
                  Magdalena, with a sigh.</p>
               <p>"That is a good girl. Be dutiful to me, and true to yourself and you will never
                  regret it. I shall not live always; but while I do live, I will guard you even
                  more carefully than I do the gold which men think I love so much. But it is our
                  dinner time—cheer up, I will reprove you no more. Dismiss that teacher, and all
                  will go smooth between us!"</p>
               <p>The daughter bowed her head in obedience as both entered the house together.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
               <p>WHEN Senor Desmondo, the music teacher of Magdalena Van Linden had gone a little
                  way down the Avenue, after leaving his fair pupil, so abruptly, he glanced back,
                  and saw that her father, who had gazed at him with such searching sternness when
                  he passed him, was evidently interrogating his daughter about the scene which he
                  had witnessed.</p>
               <p>"Devilish unlucky!" muttered the Senor, and there was very little of the Spanish
                  accent in his voice at that moment. "Devilish unlucky that the old cove should
                  have caught me when I was making my first step toward winning the good graces of
                  his softhearted daughter. Without she is sharp enough to lie him off the right
                  track, I may lose my amateur situation as her music master. But if I do, blow me
                  higher than old Lowe ever went in his balloon if I lose sight of the main chance.
                  The little heiress must be mine, by fair means or foul. My musical education was
                  helping me along amazingly with her, she could not have long withstood my tender
                  canzonets, I know, and my tale of sorrow I know reached her heart. No true
                  American, no matter what his sufferings may have been, could have reached her
                  tender susceptibilities half so easily as the poor <emph>Spanish exile</emph>. How
                  she pitied me when I told her of the lordly castle which was rightly my own on the
                  banks of the bright Guadalquiver—of the vineyards and fields I had left behind me,
                  of the state in which I once lived, and how it galled me to turn mere
                  accomplishments into sordid use, except, and how well I put that in—when I had the
                  honor and the joy of instructing a lady so beautiful, so gifted and so full of
                  true heartedness as herself. But the worst of my trouble is to keep up my Spanish
                  accent. Were she to know that my Spanish castle was air-built, my sufferings and
                  exile all inflicted by that tyrant of all tyrants, the city judge, she would lose
                  her sympathy as fast as I would lose caste! But here I am at the Club's Crib, I
                  may as well drop in and see what is going on.</p>
               <p>The soliloquy of the Senor Desmondo had been continued as he rapidly walked on,
                  until he reached the front of a house on a street leading from Union Square to the
                  Hudson River, where he halted and for a moment looked around him.</p>
               <p>The house was a plain, three story brick with nothing peculiarly different in its
                  appearance from the other houses in the same block, except that its window
                  shutters from the basement to the attic were all closed.</p>
               <p>This would lead a stranger, observing it at that hour, before the setting sun had
                  laid its good-day kiss upon the cheek of the placid Hudson, to suppose it
                  uninhabited. But had he paused a moment or so, he would have seen more than one
                  genteel-looking and well-clad man pass in or out, the ingress however only being
                  gained by a peculiar knock and by a pass-word given in a tone only audible to the
                  sentinel who guarded the inner side of the mysterious portal.</p>
               <pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6970-00000004"/>
               <p>There was a large plate upon the door, and on it these letters in a quaint
                  line.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>N. O. C.</p>
               </q>
               <p>What they indicated, is more than we can at present understand. Perhaps the future
                  may give us information on the point.</p>
               <p>Before this house. Senor Desmondo paused as he closed the soliloquy which has been
                  given above, and glancing around, as if to see whether any acquaintance was
                  watching him, he stood a moment, then ascended the steps and with the golden head
                  of his cane he struck lightly upon the door four times.</p>
               <p>In an instant a single knock was heard from the inside of the door.</p>
               <p>The Senor answered it with two knocks.</p>
               <p>"Who is there? Is it one of us?" asked some one from inside.</p>
               <p>"It <emph>is</emph>, and my wings are weary!" replied Desmondo.</p>
               <p>"The word is good—enter brother and rest!" said the same speaker from inside.</p>
               <p>And the sound of sliding bolts was heard, and in an instant more the outer door
                  was opened, revealing a small entry or hall way, not more than ten feet long, with
                  another door beyond it. A man, with a mask upon his face stood in this hall—it was
                  he who had just drawn back the bolts.</p>
               <p>As he saw the Senor Desmondo, he raised his hand in the manner of a military
                  salute and said:</p>
               <p>"I thought I knew your voice, most noble Vice, but the Coppers<ref rend="super"
                     target="#note_001" xml:id="return_001">*</ref>
                     are piping our Crib very close, and I cannot be too careful!"</p>
               <note place="foot" xml:id="note_001">
                  
                  <p><ref target="#return_001">*</ref>Police Officers.</p>
               </note>
               <p>"No Emery, you cannot be too careful. Eternal vigilance will not only be the price
                  of, but the only thing that will preserve the <emph>liberties</emph> of our Club.
                  The new City Judge is an informal improvement on some of the old set. He can
                  mother be bribed or frightened, and we must keep clear of detection and
                  indictments, or up we go! "Who is up stairs?"</p>
               <p>"The President, Secretary and about twenty of the Club. A special meeting has been
                  called to arrange some new lay I believe!"</p>
               <p>"Yes—I know that such a call was intended. I will go up and see what is going on.
                  Keep your eye peeled, for our Club has been marked. I heard a detective who
                  thought I did not know him, say that a certain musical and convivial Club was to
                  be broken up. I knew in a moment that he meant the N. O. C. But he may learn that
                  birds of our feather can see best in the dark, and when he and his friends want to
                  lay hands upon us, they may find we are like Barnum's flea—too great on a jump for
                  them—we will not be here or where he can lay a finger on us!"</p>
               <p>The Senor now passed on, the inner door opening as he touched a spring known only
                  to the initiated, which could not be seen by the light of the single jet of gas
                  which illuminated the dark hallway, but could be felt by those who knew its
                  secret.</p>
               <p>The long hall farther on was brilliantly lighted, for every shutter being closed,
                  the light of day never was admitted within those walls.</p>
               <p>Doors opening to the right, showed parlors, brilliantly lighted, and splendidly
                  furnished, but they did not seem to have any occupants at that time, and the Senor
                  Desmondo at once ascended the richly carpeted stairs to the second story, where a
                  low hum of voices could be heard, indicating the presence of the assemblage of
                  which the porter had spoken.</p>
               <p>Here at a door stood another sentinel, who recognized the Senor at once, for he
                  saluted him and said:</p>
               <p>"You are expected within, most noble Vice—they will be glad that you have
                  come!"</p>
               <p>The Senor bowed slightly and passed at once through the opened door into a long
                  room, draped in black, with seats arranged, along either side, but a wide open
                  space in the centre for its entire length.</p>
               <p>At the upper end was a kind of dais or throne, with two seats on it. One was
                  occupied by a pale, thoughtful looking man, of middle age—the other was
                  vacant.</p>
               <p>Over this throne was a huge bird, so stuffed as to imitate life. A "green 'un"
                  might have said it was an eagle. But an Ornithologist would have smiled at the
                  idea and informed you that it was an owl.</p>
               <p>From twenty to thirty persons were in this room, seated close in front of the dais
                  just spoken of, and all started to their feet as Desmondo entered, for the pale,
                  stern-faced man on the dais raised his hand and said:</p>
               <p>"Brethren—your Vice-President has come, salute him!"</p>
               <p>In an instant every right hand was raised as in the usual military salute, then
                  each hand came down as if with one thought and from each person came the word,
                     "<emph>Welcome!</emph>" all in one breath.</p>
               <p>Desmondo paused a moment at the entrance of the hall, returned the salute, and
                  then with a proud and haughty step walked up and took his seat in the vacant chair
                  on the dais, beneath the wide-spread wings of the great white owl.</p>
               <p>And now reader for a moment we will glance at the appearance of the men assembled
                  there. They are mostly young and not one among them all seems to be from that
                  noble class who earn their bread by the sweat of their brows. Rough in form and
                  visage some of them certainly are, but you see no hand there that has been
                  darkened by toil. And though well dressed mostly, you see not in any of them that
                  look which speaks of the mind, the intellect, the taste, and the sensitive
                  peculiarities of a true <emph>gentleman</emph>. They <emph>look</emph> like
                  adventurers, and in more than one sense they are adventurers.</p>
               <p>"Most noble President!" said Desmondo as he took his seat beside the pale-faced
                  occupant of the platform, "I must beg your pardon if I am late in attendance upon
                  this special meeting, but I had forgotten the hour, while occupied in planning a
                  large addition to the treasury of our Club!"</p>
               <p>"Our Vice-President need not make any apologies to us!" said the President,
                  quietly. "His past has proved his zeal, we have no fears that he will at any time
                  neglect the interests of our club. We however, are glad of his presence, for a
                  member has laid a matter before us, which must be decided on to night, or it will
                  afterward be too late to act upon it! He has discovered, it matters not to us how,
                  that the Cashier of one of the most prominent Banks in the city, with a large
                  amount of gold already in his hand, and foreign credits pre-arranged, is about to
                  leave for the other side of the ocean with a fallen angel in his company. "Of
                  course in all 'stealings' which come to our knowledge we must have a share. That
                  is a rule of our Club. But the question is this. Whether we shall make him
                  disgorge to us, all that he has taken, leaving him only enough to cross the water
                  with, or with the knowledge of his guilt as our weapon, force him to aid us in
                  cleaning the vaults of the bank entirely. That we can do so, there is no doubt,
                  for a man who stands on the verge of ruin, having committed a crime, will not
                  hesitate to enlarge upon it to secure himself from immediate destruction. What
                  thinks our Vice-President of the matter?"</p>
               <p>The Senor Desmondo paused a moment, and then as a thought flashed upon his mind,
                  he asked:</p>
               <p>"Is the Bank you allude to, not the Alsatia, of Wall street?"</p>
               <p>"It is—how came our Vice-President to hit so quickly the spot where our mine
                  lays?"</p>
               <p>"Because not an hour since I had a most friendly look from one of its directors
                  and the largest stock-holder in the concern. And because I am interested, or mean
                  to be when I marry his daughter, as a kind of junior partner in the ownership of
                  the stock. Therefore, as a party interested, let me protest against the risky
                  operation of cleaning out the vaults of the concern. Burglary is a hard thing to
                  face in these degenerate days when a burglar is no better than an honest man, and
                  I don't like the looks of it. But what that Cashier has already got, we of course
                  must have and let him get away with the blame while we enjoy the profit. That will
                  be sensible and safe!"</p>
               <p>"What say you all? Is the advice of our brother to be followed?" asked the
                  President.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Aye?</emph>" came as with one voice from the entire assemblage.</p>
               <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6970-00000005"/>
               <p>"Then our worthy Vice-President, selecting as aids, such brothers as he deems best
                  fitted for the purpose, will carry out the design and secure the money which has
                  already been taken from the bank, and also see the Cashier and his <choice>
                     <sic>failen</sic>
                     <corr>fallen</corr>
                  </choice> angel fairly afloat on blue water so that he may trouble us no more!"
                  said the President.</p>
               <p>"I accept the duty!" said Desmondo. "All the aid I require is that Johnson and
                  Messenger, with detective badges inside their coats visit the steamer with me two
                  hours before she sails. The valuable part of our <emph>friends</emph>' baggage
                  will soon be given up I think, and then he and his other 'baggage' may slide for
                  Europe!"</p>
               <p>"We will be there!" said the two men named, rising from the rest. And they looked
                  very like some of the quiet and unpretending "shadows" which may at any time be
                  seen smoking a cigar near suspicious places, or be had if sent for, to Head
                  Quarters, to trace out with the cunning of a fox and the patience of a Job any
                  rascality that has been committed since Sampson stole the gates of Gaza.</p>
               <p>This matter settled, the business meeting of the Club was dismissed, and the
                  members sought pastime in the various amusements which their Club rooms
                  afforded.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
               <p>MAGDALENA VAN LINDEN with—what shall I call it? <emph>tact</emph>—it is so rude
                  and ungentle-manly to charge the sex angelic with hypocrisy—yes, with tact and
                  special policy, pretended to be perfectly willing to accede to her father's
                  wishes, to discharge her romantic music teacher, and after she had dined with her
                  now mollified parent, she went to her chamber to write the note of dismissal.</p>
               <p>But once there, away from the stern presence of her father, her young heart
                  yielded to its natural emotions, and while tears glittered in her blue eyes, she
                  stamped her tiny foot and said to herself:</p>
               <p>"I will not wring his noble heart with a new anguish. Though he may not come to
                  teach me the use the instruments which own in him a master hand, I will not banish
                  him from a presence in which he says he has found his only happiness since he left
                  the sunny shores of his own grand old Spain. No Desmondo I will not lose you, nor
                  shall you lose me. I have promised my father to write and dismiss him. How shall I
                  write so that he shall know he is not dismissed from my heart, though my father
                  forbids me to be taught longer by him."</p>
               <p>And in deep study the young girl paced to and fro in her room for several
                  minutes.</p>
               <p>At last she sat down at her table and with open portfolios before her, began to
                  write. A note was finished and read over. It did not satisfy her and she destroyed
                  it. Another and another met the same fate.</p>
               <p>"Oh I know not how to write a dismissal that will not pain him!" she murmured. "He
                  is so noble, so tender-hearted, so easily touched by the least slight—oh if he
                  only knew how I loved him, he would take me to his own sunny land in spite of
                  every obstacle!"</p>
               <p>And tears ran down the fair cheeks of Magdalena as she spoke.</p>
               <p>Again she took up her pen and wrote. This time a quiet smile of satisfaction told
                  that her effort had been more successful We will read the note ourselves.</p>

                              you kissed my hand this evening. He was in a towering rage with me and
                              ordered me instantly to dismiss you as my teacher. This you must know
                              I am most unwilling to do, for no one can teach me so well as you. If

                              without he gives me leave to recall you. I know that you meant no
                              harm, I certainly did not receive any harm from the kiss which your
                              manly lips pressed upon my poor hand. But my father is stern and harsh
                              and thinks of but two things. His petted daughter, and the wealth
                              which he keeps increasing, as if he thought he and I were to live
                              forever. I suppose I must obey him, and ask you not to come again as
                              my music teacher. But should the Senor Desmondo ever wish to call as a
                              friend and to meet as a friend, the lonely girl whose heart he has
                              often filled with joy as he sung the grand old songs of Spain and her

               <p>"There!" said she, after she had carefully read the note over "I have fulfilled my
                  promise to father, and I do not think I have said any thing which can wound the
                  proud and sensitive heart of the noble Spaniard. And when father knows that I have
                  stopped taking music lessons altogether, he may reconsider his decision!"</p>
               <p>And Magdalena enveloped her note, sealed it carefully with amber colored wax, the
                  perfume of which filled the room as she burned it, and then with a careful hand
                  directed it in her prettiest style.</p>
               <p>A sigh of pleasure came softly from her lips when all this was done.</p>
               <p>"He will come every day, I know he will!" she murmured.</p>
               <p>Then she took the note and went to order it at once to be sent to the lodgings of
                  the <emph>dismissed</emph> music teacher.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
               <p>THE English steamer Canada, with the sails loosed on her yards and her steam up,
                  lay at her moorings in the Hudson river, opposite her wharf at Jersey City,
                  receiving her mails, the last of her passengers, and only waiting the hour of
                  twelve to arrive to fire her parting gun and start on her trackless path across
                  the blue Atlantic for the shore of ancient Albion. The most of her passengers were
                  already on board and having their state-rooms secured, were now promenading the
                  upper deck, looking over at the great city with its spires and domes glittering in
                  the sunlight, or down the fortress-bordered bay, dotted with a thousand snowy
                  sails. At the hour of ten two passengers came on board who attracted considerable
                  attention and some sympathy</p>
               <p>One was a very feeble looking white-haired and white bearded old man, who seemed
                  scarcely able to move across the deck, trembling as he leaned upon the arm of a
                  beautiful young woman, who appeared to be his daughter from the tenderness which
                  she exhibited to him. A dry and husky cough broke from his lips every few moments,
                  and it would seem by that as well as his cadaverous looks, that he would hardly
                  live to see the shores upon the other side of the ocean.</p>
               <p>This old man and his young companion came on board in a private barge, having a
                  large quantity of very heavy baggage with them, which was speedily brought on deck
                  and carried to a double state-room, which it appeared had already been engaged and
                  paid for by them. To this room they soon retired, but not to remain there
                  undisturbed as we soon shall see.</p>
               <p>When they came on board, the man whom we have so far known as Senor Desmondo with
                  his two friends stood near the gangway on the watch. They had been there for an
                  hour and had closely scrutinized every one who came on board, but so far had not
                  seen the persons whom they desired to meet. But when that feeble old man came
                  trembling over the side of the vessel, a triumphant gleam of light flashed out of
                  the eyes of Desmondo, and he said in a low tone to his companions:</p>
               <p>"There the curse is, at last, and so well made up that his friend the Devil would
                  hardly know him. He does the <emph>old</emph> a little too much for nature, shakes
                  and quivers rather more than nature would in such a case. If I hadn't known the
                  woman I should have looked twice before I could have recognized him!"</p>
               <p>"What will you do with him?" asked one of the men.</p>
               <p>"Wait a little and you will see. We have two hours yet before the steamer starts.
                  Their luggage is being carried to their state-room and they are going there
                  themselves. When they are in, I shall follow. You two will remain at the state
                  room door. If I call, come in—if I do not, I shall have been successful, and shall
                  then only want you to aid in getting the spare luggage ashore!"</p>
               <p>His instruction thus given, Desmondo sauntered quietly around, closely watching
                  the old man and his companion until they<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6970-00000006"/>
                  and their baggage were inside of the state room and its door closed.</p>
               <p>Then he at once stepped forward and boldly knocked at the door of the room He had
                  to knock a second time before his application was heeded, and then the young lady
                  came to the door and opening it, asked what was wanted</p>
               <p>"I wish to see Mr. Swinzer upon very important business!" said Desmondo,
                  coolly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Swinzer? I know no such person!" said the young lady, gasping spasmodically,
                  her face whitening to a deadly pallor.</p>
               <p>"Who is that feeble old gentleman whom you just assisted into his bunk yonder?"
                  asked Desmondo, with a quiet smile.</p>
               <p>My father, Sir—my poor old father who is going home to England to die!" said the
                  young lady with an excited look and tone.</p>
               <p>"Permit me to feel his pulse—I am a physician, and may relieve his weakness!" said
                  Desmondo, as he suddenly stepped past the young lady, and before she could speak
                  or interpose to prevent him, he stood by the side of the old man.</p>
               <p>"Do you see this, Sir?" he said in a low tone, as he exhibited from the inside of
                  his coat, the well known shield of a police officer.</p>
               <p>"Oh God, I am discovered, and all is lost!" groaned the old man, and as he rose,
                  he cried to the young woman, "Clara shut the state room door—we are lost—we are
                  lost!"</p>
               <p>The young lady instantly closed the door and rushed to the side of the old man,
                  looking beseechingly at Desmondo who stood with a sarcastic smile on his face,
                  eyeing them both.</p>
               <p>"You are ready to go back with me, I suppose Mr. Swinzer!" said he. "The bank of
                  Alsatia will soon discover its loss and then there will be a stunning reward
                  offered for you which I of course shall get, bolding you as I intend to in safe
                  custody until the law calls for you!"</p>
               <p>"Do they not know of—of my—my abstraction of the funds at the bank yet?" asked the
                  old man hurriedly.</p>
               <p>'Not yet, but I and my two brother officers who stand at the door do, and you well
                  know that it is our duty to arrest you and to take charge of the one hundred and
                  fifty thousand dollars, half of it in gold, which is now in those trunks!"</p>
               <p>And Desmondo pointed to two small trunks in a corner of the room.</p>
               <p>"Oh no sir—no sir, if you arrest him I too am exposed and ruined!" sobbed the
                  young woman, casting herself on her knees before Desmondo. "Do let Mr. Swinzer
                  go—we will never be heard of again in the country?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, you find that it is Mr. Swinzer instead of being your poor old father going
                  home to die. His make up is very good. If Lingard could get him to play
                  Grandfather Whitehead at the New Bowery he'd have full house for a whole
                  season!"</p>
               <p>"Oh sir do not torture me. Say that yon still spare us from the humiliation and
                  disgrace of arrest and there is nothing on earth which I will not grant you!"</p>
               <p>"You are very kind young lady but <emph>you</emph> can grant me no favors at
                  present. But I will give Mr. Swinzer one chance to save himself, for I really pity
                  a person of forty years, who in a single day has remorsefully grown into an
                  octogenarian. I never have seen old age come so quickly on a man before!"</p>
               <p>"Sir, if you are a man, cease this badinage!" cried the disguised Cashier. "Cease
                  it, I pray and if there is any way by which I can be kept outside of the prison
                  bars, name it and your conditions!"</p>
               <p>"I will in a moment!" replied Desmondo, "What money have you in your pocket book
                  now."</p>
               <p>"About two thousand dollars, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Well that is enough, with economy to carry you all over Europe. If you choose to
                  deliver to me the money you have so basely taken from the bank, so that I can
                  return it after the steamer sails and claim the reward which they will offer when
                  they learn their loss, I will let you go—that is if you choose to deliver it
                     <emph>willingly</emph>. If not, I take you, money and all and your first water
                  voyage will be up to Sing Sing instead of across the ocean.</p>
               <p>"Take it—take all—those two small trunks of which these are the keys, contain
                  all—all for which I have perilled my soul and blasted my whole life! Take them
                  away and keep my secret to the last moment, for I would sooner die than fall into
                  the hands of those who so long my friends, would now be my deadliest enemies!"
                  said the miserable criminal.</p>
               <p>"You are both reasonable and sensible!" said Desmondo quietly. "I will unlock and
                  examine the trunks and if their contents are satisfactory you will go unmolested
                  from me!"</p>
               <p>And suiting his action to his words Desmondo hastily unlocked the trunks and
                  examined the gold and English bank notes which they contained.</p>
               <p>"It is all here!" he said as he reclosed the trunks. "I will call my brother
                  officers and have them removed and you are free. In the classic language of the
                  immortal Beecher, permit me to add, Mr. Swinzer, go and sin no more until you have
                  another good opening!"</p>
               <p>And the Senor signalled to his two companions to enter. When they came in, he
                  pointed to the two trunks and said:</p>
               <p>"My aged friend here has requested me to see his overplus baggage safe on shore
                  and you will oblige me by taking charge of it, gentlemen!"</p>
               <p>His associates at once shouldered the trunks and then the accomplished
                  Vice-President of the N. O. C. bowed low and profoundly to the miserable Cashier
                  of the Alsatia Bank and the frail partner of his guilty flight, wishing them a
                  pleasant voyage, and turning on his heel left them to study how best to save the
                  little which he had left them, instead of doing as they expected to do, that is,
                  living and travelling in princely style on the amount which he had stolen from the
                  Bank.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
               <p>THE barge which conveyed Senor Desmondo and his friends to the shore had but just
                  landed them and their recovered treasure on Pier One North River, when the soft
                  toned bell of old Trinity struck twelve. And at the same instant a white ring of
                  smoke leaped out from the forecastle of the British steamer and the sharp sound of
                  her parting gun rang over the waters and echoed from shore to shore of the busy
                  river. The huge red wheels of the steamer began slowly to revolve, her great black
                  hull began to change its position, soon it was heading down the stream then the
                  sails which had been hanging loose upon the yards were sheeted home and hoisted
                  up, then gathering headway both from the stiff northwest breeze that was blowing
                  and the full force of pent up steam, away she started on her race against Time,
                  for another continent. There <emph>may</emph> have been many happy hearts
                  throbbing on board of that steamer then as she swept so proudly down our beautiful
                  bay—two hearts there were on beard we know, guilt-laden and wretched, which could
                  never know joy again. Two persons there who had been rudely wakened from a dream
                  of fancied security in crime and who had been robbed of the golden balm which they
                  had fondly hoped was to lull them by enjoyment, into forgetfulness of the wrong
                  they had done and were doing.</p>
               <p>They did not stand out on the deck as others did to return the cheers and the
                  wavings which came from many a lip and hand as they passed down the bay, but
                  hidden away in their close-locked state room, they sat and trembled until the long
                  and steady heave of the vessel upon the great waves of the Atlantic told them that
                  the shore and the peril which they most dreaded was left far behind.</p>
               <p>Senor Desmondo and his companions stood and watched the steamer until she was
                  moving at full speed down the channel, then the former beckoned to a coachman who
                  had been all this time in waiting for him and the trunks were put upon the coach.
                  One of his companions mounted the box with the driver, the other entered the coach
                  with him, and then it was driven off as quietly as if it only contained two or
                  three ordinary passengers with their usual travelling baggage.</p>
               <p>Of course its destination was the Club House of the N. O. C.</p>

               <p>WELL satisfied with a profitable day's labor in the golden soil of Wall street,
                  Mr. Van Linden returned at the usual hour to his Fifth Avenue home to meet his

               <p>On this occasion he met no bewhiskered music teacher to cast a shadow in his
                     path—<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6970-00000007"/> there was nothing to draw a
                  frown upon his broad brow, and he received his daughters kiss with a smile that
                  showed that his heart was not all frozen.</p>
               <p>"Well my child how have you passed the day?" he asked after having received and
                  returned her kiss.</p>
               <p>"Reading, a part of the time, and this afternoon I took a <choice>

               <p>"Alone, Magdalena?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, alone, father. Who had I to take with me?"</p>
               <p>"Why some of your lady acquaintances to be sure. There are the Fitzpatrick girls,
                  ladylike and of good blood, you could not have better companionship!"</p>
               <p>"Had I invited them to ride with me father, they might have wished to have their
                  handsome brother go along and you must remember that you told me but a few days
                  ago that I must avoid his society!"</p>
               <p>"Why yes, I believe I did. He is very good-looking, but wild, too wild to be good
                  company for a young girl like you my daughter. That was my only objection to him.
                  I am afraid that—ah what is this?"</p>
               <p>The last exclamation made by the old gentleman was caused by the action of a boy
                  of ten or twelve years of age, who ran up the steps, handed the financier a letter
                  and then darted away as quickly as he came.</p>
               <p>"A letter and directed to me, Linden Van Linden, Esquire of the Fifth Avenue!"
                  said the old gentleman after he had settled his spectacles upon his nose and read
                  the superscription.</p>
               <p>And he proceeded to open it with a quiet and steady hand.</p>
               <p>But a sudden change came over him before he had read five lines of the letter.</p>

               <p>"What is the matter father—you are strangely agitated?"</p>
               <p>"Matter enough child, matter enough! If the information given in this note is
                  true, the Alsatia Bank is ruined. But I will not believe it until I go and see for
                  myself whether it be true or not. I will not believe it. <emph>Swinzer</emph>, the
                  Cashier, this note says, has abstracted all the gold from the vaults and taken
                  with him other monies, at least one hundred and fifty thousand dollars, perhaps
                  more. No I will not believe it, for he has sustained his integrity and his
                  position there for full twenty years. But I must go and see. I could neither eat,
                  drink or sleep with this matter on my mind and I must know the best or the worst
                  at once. Ring for the coachman and send him here my dear!"</p>
               <p>Magdalena obeyed her fathers' order and in a few moments the old gentleman was
                  going as fast as his carriage could be driven, to see the President of the Alsatia
                  Bank and to learn to his sorrow and dismay that the information given in the

               <p>MAGDALENA VAN LINDEN sat in her little chamber weeping. It was the afternoon of

                  had not availed himself of it.</p>
               <p>"I have driven him forever from me!" she murmured, with a sob. "His proud heart
                  was outraged by his abrupt and unnecessary dismissal and I shall see him no more.
                  I wish my father would attend to his money, his rents and his stocks, and leave me
                  alone to act as my heart dictates. Poor Desmondo, I would rather share your
                  poverty, than to be, as I am, heiress to all my father's wealth!"</p>
               <p>"A card for my lady!" said a servant entering the room at that moment.</p>
               <p>Magdalena glanced at the card and she could scarcely repress a cry of joy as she
                  saw upon it the name of him who was uppermost in her thoughts.</p>
               <p>"Where is the gentleman, Robert?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"In the parlor Miss Magdalena!" replied the servant.</p>
               <p>"Tell him I will be down in a few minutes!" she said.</p>
               <p>Then as the servant left her alone, she stood with her bosom heaving like the
                  billows of the ocean, her form quivering with excitement, her eyes humid with the
                  exuberance of her joy.</p>
               <p>"He has not forgotten me!" she murmured in a low, passionate tone. "He is not yet
                  lost to me. I cannot go to see him yet, for now I should throw myself weeping on
                  his bosom. I will be calm—I will try to be dignified, but it is hard, for I love
                  him so, <emph>so</emph> much! He must not see that I have been weeping!"</p>
               <p>The young girl hastened to bathe her eyes and forehead in cold water and then to
                  make some alterations in, and addition to her toilet, for woman-like she wished to
                  enhance every charm she had, so as to appear beautiful in his eyes.</p>
               <p>Then when once more calm she hastened down to the parlor where she found the
                  stately <emph>Spaniard</emph> with folded arms standing before a portrait of
                  herself, painted by Elliott.</p>
               <p>He heard the rustle of her garments as she entered the door and turning toward
                  her, cast a look of sorrowful reproach upon her. But she did not heed it.</p>
               <p>"Oh I am <emph>so</emph> glad you have come!" she cried. "I was afraid that you
                  were so offended that you would never come again?"</p>
               <p>"It is a pain to stand beneath a roof the master of which is my enemy!" said
                  Desmondo with a deep and tragic tone. "But I could not stay away from you, angel
                  that you are, any longer. Had death stood in my way I would have met it rather
                  than to suffer as I have in utter loneliness of heart for the last three
                  days!"</p>
               <p>"Oh why did you not come sooner—I have been very lonely, very wretched!"</p>
               <p>"And wretched because <emph>I</emph> was not near Magdalena?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Senor Desmondo, yes. I will not try to veil my heart from you. Life, when
                  you are not near me, is a blank. My father in his cruelty bade me dismiss you as
                  my teacher. But neither he or any earthly power can banish you from my heart. The
                  sound of your voice has been ringing in my ears ever since I heard your last
                  thrilling song—my hand yet feels the warm touch of your lips! oh never before have
                  I known what love is—were it death I would glory in it!"</p>
               <p>"Angel you are not fit to dwell in this cold, this icy clime. Your nature is as
                  fervid, your soul as warm as are the natures and the souls of the maidens of my
                  own dear native land, while your beauty even yet more glorious than theirs, is
                  enough to madden one whose eyes have no other idol to gaze upon. Magdalena,
                  Magdalena, you must, you shall be mine!"</p>
               <p>And the pretended Spaniard clasped the poor, yielding, passion-blinded girl to his
                  breast and showered kiss after kiss upon her brow and cheeks and lips.</p>
               <p>And she, trembling like a dove under a serpent's magic charming, did not shrink
                  from his caresses—she did not think that he could be other than the hero of her
                  wild fancy, the poor "Spanish Exile" who had been unkindly driven from his home,
                  from his native land and all the joys which made that home a blessing.</p>
               <p>And he, fiend that he was, gloried in the power which he held over that young and
                  trusting heart, gloried in it, because he hoped through that power to be able to
                  add funds to the treasury of the vile association of thieves and libertines to
                  which he belonged. Little cared he for the heart which would break when it found
                  itself betrayed and <choice>
                     <sic>decieved</sic>
                     <corr>deceived</corr>
                  </choice>—little cared he for the wreck which he would make—her money once his, it
                  would matter not how quickly the object which he pretended to adore went down into
                  the abyss of shame or death.</p>
               <p>Fair reader, young and artless reader, this is no fancy sketch, I but describe a
                  tragic event of real life. Take warning and beware of the serpent which even now
                  may be casting its alluring charms around you.</p>
               <p>But back truant mind and wandering pen to your duty and go on with the story.</p>
               <p>For a little time, forgetting in the joy of his presence and in the tenderness of
                  his caresses, that Desmondo might be discovered by her father, for it was near the
                  usual hour of his return—Magdalena abandoned herself to the joy of the moment. But
                  the dread of her stern father's anger was too great in her heart to be utterly
                  forgotten and as she glanced at the ormolu clock on the mantle-piece, she saw the
                  hour and with a sigh she said:</p>
               <p>"Senor it is nearly the hour when my father will return from business. He must not
                  find you here, if he does his anger will be terrible!"</p>
               <p>"For <emph>myself</emph>, I fear not the anger of any living man!" said Desmondo
                  haughtily. Then in a softer tone he added—"I will leave you, my poor suffering
                  angel rather than that you should be blamed on my account. But I hope and pray
                  that you will soon give me a right to defend and protect you which no man, not
                  even a father can gainsay, that of a <emph>husband</emph>. I will not press it
                  now, for I have not time. But think of it <foreign xml:lang="ITA">monona
                     mia</foreign> until next we meet and then give me your answer. And now
                     farewell—<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6970-00000008"/> no not farewell, for soon,
                  very soon we will meet again. And if it be your will when next we meet, it will be
                  to part no more!"</p>
               <p>One wild kiss upon her burning lips and Desmondo was gone. For minutes she stood
                  there alone like one enchanted, her very soul flooded with happiness and it was
                  not until she heard the sound of her father's voice that she recovered her self <choice>
                     <sic>posession</sic>
                     <corr>possession</corr>

               <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
               <p>The voice of her father aroused Magdalena from the delirious dream of ecstacy
                  which had fairly enwrapped her senses and she felt a tremulous sinking at her
                  heart, for she feared that he might have met Desmondo before the latter had left
                  the house. Her father was speaking to some one in the high tone which he only used
                  when he was angry and she felt almost certain that her late visitor had caused his
                  anger.</p>
               <p>Naturally possessed of a strong will and now nerved by her love for Desmondo,
                  Magdalena determined at once to confront her father and if blame was to be borne
                  by any one, to take it upon herself. So she left her room and went down to the
                  main hall where her father was standing. He was talking in a sharp tone to his
                  butler or steward about something connected with his office, but he ceased when
                  his daughter approached and the man, apparently glad of the relief, hurried
                  away.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter dear father?" asked Magdalena, as she approached her father
                  with her usual kiss and embrace.</p>
               <p>"Matter enough, child! matter enough. I'm in a bad humor with myself and every
                  body else. With ten thousand dollars reward offered for the capture of that robber
                  Swinzer, the Cashier of our bank, the detectives of our boasted police cannot get
                  even the slightest track of him. I know the rascal must be lurking around the city
                  somewhere. If he had gone away he must have been recognized, for we have
                  telegraphed his description in every direction. We must find him, for the Bank has
                  been half ruined by his operations. Were it not for my credit, its money would not
                  bring twenty cents on the dollar. Is that not enough to put one in a bad humor,
                  eh?"</p>
               <p>Magdalena whose fears of the discovery of her lover's late visit had now vanished,
                  laughed heartily, as her father thus appealed to her.</p>
               <p>"Why father," said she, in her old merry tone, "if this man Swinzer had carried
                  off the old bank money, stones, bricks and all, in one big satanic grab, you could
                  replace it without drawing much more than the yearly interest of your present
                  fortune. Why fret yourself about the loss of a hundred thousand dollars or so. If
                  the world knew that such a loss affected you, it would at once set you down as
                  getting poor!"</p>
               <p>"I don't know but you're right, Magdalena. I will curb my impatience. But our
                  police need never brag to <emph>me</emph> of their efficiency again. I would give
                  much to learn who it was that first discovered the villainy of Swinzer and wrote
                  to me about it. He, whoever he was, could most likely put us on the track of the
                  robber. I have advertised to find him and hope to do so!"</p>
               <p>"And, father, after you have found him, should you through him find this man
                  Swinzer, what good would that do you?"</p>
               <p>"Why we'd make the rascal return our money. We'd make him disgorge—aye, we'd make
                  him disgorge!"</p>
               <p>"Suppose that he whom you say robbed your bank of so much, has himself been robbed
                  by gamblers and sharpers. What then?"</p>
               <p>"Why we'd put him in prison and keep him there until the very flesh rotted from
                  his bones!"</p>
               <p>"Oh father, you make me shudder! You are worse than that Shylock who would rather
                  have had his pound of christian flesh than all his ducats!"</p>
               <p>"He wanted his bond, child, and he was right and should have had it. But you are
                  laughing at your old father now and I may as well get good humored again and laugh
                  with you. All will turn out right yet perhaps and if it does not, I have still
                  enough left to keep frost from our limbs and starvation from our mouth. By the
                  way, did your music teacher ask why you dismissed him?"</p>
               <p>"No sir. The Senor Desmondo is too proud to ask for <emph>reasons</emph> when his
                  further services have been declined. I wrote his letter of dismissal as you bade
                  me do and that is the end of it I hope!"</p>
               <p>"Have you selected a new teacher yet?"</p>
               <p>"No sir, and shall not. I was so unfortunate as to displease you in my last
                  selection and I am sure I shall not run another risk of the same kind. I can get
                  along very well without taking music lessons!"</p>
               <p>"Child, child, you astonish me! You know that it is my desire that you should be
                  thoroughly accomplished. To be proficient in music, is an accomplishment which
                  must not be neglected. I care not what it cost, masters of music you
                     <emph>must</emph> have the best, too! One of these days some high-born,
                  educated and wealthy man will see you and smitten alike by your beauty and your
                  education, he will seek your hand!"</p>
               <p>"And get laughed at for his pains!" said Magdalena scornfully. When such a man
                  seeks to make me his slave I will tell him to go to Circassia and there to buy a
                  wife!"</p>
               <p>"Child, you do not know what you are talking about. When I find a man whose wealth
                  and social position will place him on the same level with myself, and that man,
                  pleased with <emph>you</emph>, seeks your hand, he will not ask me for it in
                  vain!"</p>
               <p>"So, I am in the market then, am I? To be disposed of to the highest bidder! It is
                  a pity I was not a little darker in complexion. You might get a better price for
                  me in Cuba!" cried Magdalena, her face flushed with indignation and her voice
                  raised a key higher than he had ever heard it before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Van Linden was so surprised at this strange and in him unaccountable ebulition
                  of passion to his daughter, usually so mild and gentle, that he forgot his own
                  anger, forgot for the moment probably, even all his late annoyances.</p>
               <p>"Come with me to the library, daughter!" he said. "I must talk you into reason,
                  for it seems to me that you are going out of your senses!"</p>
               <p>And he led the way to a large room in the rear of his parlor which was indeed a
                     <emph>library</emph>, in fact, as well as in name. For shelves rising from the
                  floor to the lofty ceiling on every side, leaving only the spaces vacant where the
                  windows and doors were located, were filled with books. For a true student, for
                  one who could <emph>live</emph> in the fields of poetry, history, romance, or of
                  science, such a library would be the next thing to Paradise.</p>
               <p>Pointing a seat to Magdalena, Mr. Van Linflen seated himself close by her side,
                  his arm resting on a table which was covered by choice drawings from the pencil of
                  her drawing master, one of the first artists in the city, who by a most liberal
                  salary had been induced to take Magdalena as his only pupil.</p>
               <p>"Now Magdalena, if you have grown calm enough to talk, to talk <choice>
                     <sic>reasonalby</sic>
                     <corr>reasonably</corr>
                  </choice>, I mean, I wish you to tell me of one act on my part which could justify
                  you in speaking as if I treated you like a slave. Speak my girl and tell me when I
                  have been tyranical to you!"</p>
               <p>Magdalena was silent. She knew that she had been petted and indulged in her every
                  wish and whim—that no gratification which money could purchase had been denied to
                  her—that she had never expressed a desire which he had not hastened to
                  gratify.</p>
               <p>"You were hurt because I told you to dismiss a music teacher, who evidently felt
                  himself above his business and whom <emph>I</emph> detected when taking a liberty
                  which your own sense of self-respect and womanly dignity should have caused you
                  instantly to resent!"</p>
               <p>Magdalena was still silent. She saw that her father had the strongest position and
                  that no words of hers at that point could help her case.</p>
               <p>"No man but the equal of my daughter in every social respect, must ever dare to
                  raise her hand to his lips!" continued Mr. Van Linden.</p>
               <p>"Is it a crime to be unfortunate?" now asked Magdalena in a low tone, her eyes
                  looking down and so shaded by their long dark lashes that he could not see
                  them.</p>
               <p>"Not without one's own folly or crime has brought on the misfortune!"</p>
               <p>"Was it a crime in a Spanish nobleman that he expressed in his own land a love for
                  free and republican institutions thereby incurring the anger of his queen and her
                  nobility, who would have chained him down in a dungeon had he not fled away to the
                  land whose institutions he had praised!"</p>
               <p>"If not a crime it was a folly. But I doubt if any Spanish nobleman was ever
                  exiled for <emph>that</emph> cause. They are too much attached to the old
                  monarchical rule to wish for a change! I understand your allusion my child, and
                  have no doubt that you believe the story which this music teacher has told you, to
                  be true. I do not, for it wears no probability on its face. A <emph>noble</emph>
                  exile, would be welcomed to our land,<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6970-00000009"/> by
                  the first people in it. I well remember when Horace Greeley went wild over
                  Kossuth, when other leaders in the political world were equally enthusiastic in
                  regard to General Lopez—but I hear no word, see no writings in regard to—by the
                  way what <emph>is</emph> your music master's name?"</p>
               <p>"He is now known as the Senor Desmondo. But his real name and rank he will not
                  reveal to any one at present!"</p>
               <p>A sarcastic smile passed over the face of the old gentleman.</p>
               <p>"I <emph>know</emph> that he <emph>is</emph> noble—his looks, his language, his
                  very accomplishments all give assurance of it!" said Magdalena warmly.</p>
               <p>Then so much greater the reason why you should not desire to place him in a menial
                  position, for any one we employ, we make less than ourselves!"</p>
               <p>But father he must have employment or he will starve!"</p>
               <p>"He never will starve in this country while he wears diamonds?" said Mr. Van
                  Linden, quietly. "There are people who would feed him, just for the pleasure of
                  looking at them. But a truce to all nonsense. If you wish me to prove to you that
                  that man is a humbug and his story a deceit, send for him and let me examine him.
                  If I find that he is even a <emph>gentleman</emph>—his nobility I care not a pin
                  for—I will permit him if he wishes to do so to continue your music lessons!"</p>
               <p>"Dear—dear father? You are only too kind to your wilful child. I will write for
                  him to come and see him to-morrow and if you do not find him to be as he
                  represents himself, then I will be as ready to discard him as you can be!"</p>
               <p>"It is a bargain, daughter. And now dry your checks and be my own good-tempered
                  child again!"</p>
               <p>"I will father and will always be so, without you go to talking about marrying me
                  off as if I was a piece of merchandise!"</p>
               <p>"You <emph>are</emph> a piece of merchandise my girl—a rather valuable one, since
                  no five fortunes in the Union could <emph>purchase</emph> you from me. And I am
                  sure that I shall watch closely that you are not stolen from me. Now let us go and
                  dine since the storm is over. Send for your music master and if he stands
                  examination, he can visit my house as a gentleman, rather than a teacher!"</p>
               <p>Mr. Van Linden had conquered. Magdalena thought the conquest her own, but we see
                  that she is mistaken.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
               <p>SENOR DESMONDO was seated in the private parlor which adjoined his bed-chamber in
                  the fashionable boarding house where he resided. He was not alone. The quiet,
                  pale-faced President of the "N. O. C." was with him. They were conversing in low
                  tones. They were planning new crimes, more work for the lawless men with whom they
                  were associated, or of whom they were the chiefs.</p>
               <p>A knock at the door startled them slightly, for the law breaker is never at rest,
                  never self-conscious of perfect safety.</p>
               <p>Desmondo rose and went to the door to see who was there. It was only a servant who
                  brought a note which he said had just been left at the door for
                     <emph>Professor</emph> Desmondo.</p>
               <p>For here the Vice-President of the "N. O. C." was known as a Professor of Music
                  and thought by his landlady and all her female boarders to be a perfect prince of
                  a man. They too had heard and believed also his story of exile and suffering and
                  they valued him all the more for it.</p>
               <p>Dismissing the servant with a kind word and a small present in money, Desmondo
                  returned to his seat with the note which he at once opened.</p>
               <p>A shade darkened his brow as he read its contents and a muttered curse came from
                  his lips.</p>
               <p>"The devilish little fool is working her case up a cursed sight too fast!" he said
                  in a tone of impatience. "She has had another quarrel with her father about me and
                  she boasts that she has so far conquered his repugnance that he expresses a desire
                  to see me and talk with me!"</p>
               <p>"Well," said his companion, the President, "is there anything risky in seeing him?
                  Can you not tell the same plausible tale that you won her susceptible heart
                  with?"</p>
               <p>"I can tell him the tale of course, but there is a serious doubt in my mind as to
                  his being as easy of belief as she was. I was measured once by his cold grey eye
                  and I felt as if he was looking through and through me, though I passed on without
                  appearing to notice him. I dread to meet him—I hardly know why either!"</p>
               <p>"If you do meet him and win his favor, the rest of your plan will be worked up
                  easily without a chance of failure!"</p>
               <p>"That is true. It is worth the risk—I will write her a note now and send it in the
                  morning, saying that I will visit her father and her self to-morrow night!"</p>
               <p>"Good—write it, while I look over Sam Yeatman's report. Him and Stanley are on a
                  big thing if they can carry it through. But that Stanley is a treacherous curse
                  and don't carry out our principle of being honest to each other, even if we do
                  prey on the world at large."</p>
               <p>"No, but his double dealing will cost him his neck yet. He has long since
                  forfeited our aid and protection if he should get into trouble. But I will write
                  while you read!"</p>
               <p>And Desmondo went to a side table and opening the writing desk on it proceeded to
                  write a note to Magdalena, telling her how happy he would be to accede to her
                  wishes in calling to see her father.</p>
               <p>It took him but a few moments and when he had done, his friend had also finished
                  reading the report of which he had spoken.</p>
               <p>"Well what does Yeatman say?" asked Desmondo, as the President folded up the paper
                  and replaced it in his pocket.</p>
               <p>"That he is on a lay where he can make a big haul from a Broadway Bank if his pal
                  is faithful and backs him up when ready for a grab. He has been watching a
                  careless clerk there for some time and could have made a small haul on several
                  occasions, but he waits to see a big pile within reach!"</p>
               <p>"Good! Sam is smart and a valuable member of the Club. What shall we do to-night
                  to kill time—go around to the Club Room?"</p>
               <p>"No—there is nothing special to do there, I think a look into the Theatres will
                  not be amiss. We may find some country flat there with more money than brains and
                  have a little fun in initiating him into the Mysteries of New York!"</p>
               <p>"Well, be it as you say—I am in for any thing that pays, from a gun contract to a
                  speculation in shoddy!"</p>
               <p>And Senor Desmondo made some alterations and improvements in his dress and in a
                  few minutes declared himself ready for the walk.</p>
               <p>"To which theater first?" was his question, as both took their hats and canes in
                  hand.</p>
               <p>"The New Bowery, I think!" said the President. "They're doing up an Equestrian
                  Drama there and that always draws crowded houses. They have the stage and the
                  scenery for such things and I like them!"</p>
               <p>"Well the New Bowery be it then!" said Desmondo and he and his friend took their
                  departure, both of them genteel in appearance and so well-dressed that no stranger
                  would ever think that they could be evil-doers or criminals.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
               <p>ANOTHER day is over and another night has cloaked the earth in darkness. Mr.
                  Linden Van Linden had dined heartily, wined plentifully and now sat with his
                  daughter in the parlor in the best humor, waiting to see if her music-teacher
                  would toe the mark and call at a time when he had leisure to converse with him and
                  to see whether he was what he had pretended to his daughter to be.</p>
               <p>Magdalena, slightly nervous, sat near him, listening for the sound of the street
                  bell.</p>
               <p>It was near eight o'clock when she heard it, and she could hardly refrain from
                  springing to her feet and going herself to open the door, but she dared not do so
                  in her fathers presence and she kept her seat, her heart fluttering, while a
                  servant attended the door.</p>
               <p>It seemed to her a long, long time, yet it was not more than a minute or two
                  before the servant announced the name of the visitor and the Senor with a haughty,
                  but a graceful step, entered the room.</p>
               <p>He bowed low to Magdalena, who at once introduced him to her father.</p>
               <p>The latter invited him to be seated, keenly glancing at him from head to foot, as
                  he stepped forward and took a chair.</p>
               <p>Dressed in excellent taste, richly but plainly, with his "family diamonds" the
                  only ornaments on his person, the Senor certainly had an aristocratic and
                  distinguished look. He looked very Spanish too with his <choice>
                     <sic>aquline</sic>
                     <corr>aquiline</corr>
                  </choice> features, his jet black eyes and his raven hair and beard. His accent to
                  was quite Spanish and his English rather imperfect as he spoke to Magdalena and
                  her father.</p>
               <p>The suspicions of the latter began to melt away before he had exchanged twenty
                     words<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6970-00000010"/> with the music teacher and he
                  began to think that he had been too precipitate in causing her to dismiss a person
                  who seemed both amiable and gentlemanly.</p>
               <p>"My daughter tells me that you have not been long in this country, Senor!" said he
                  in a kind tone.</p>
               <p>"Long enough to learn to value the freedom which I admired from a distance as I
                  read of it in history before I was forced to leave my native land!" replied
                  Desmondo.</p>
               <p>"Then you like a republic better than a monarchy?"</p>
               <p>"Ah yes sir—for in a republic merit is the true nobility. Energy and industry,
                  coupled with God-given genius, may lift a man from obscurity into the proud
                  position of the chief of the nation!"</p>
               <p>"That is true, Senor! You are a close observer of men and things!"</p>
               <p>"I ever have been sir. Too close an observer and too free a speaker for my own
                  good in my native land. But here one can see and think and speak what he please,
                  without fear of exile or of death. It is sad for me to be far away from my
                  home.</p>
               <p>"Do you find music-teaching sufficiently profitable for a comfortable support,
                  Senor? Pardon my asking the question, for if it is not, I might aid you to find
                  some more profitable employment!"</p>
               <p>"I can <emph>live</emph> by it, sir—and I am more proficient in music than any
                  other accomplishment which I could make serviceable here!"</p>
               <p>"Could you not as a translator and correspondent for some house dealing with Spain
                  or Cuba, or South America find better pay and less labor?"</p>
               <p>"I do not know sir, for I am not acquainted with any merchants!"</p>
               <p>"If you will permit it, I will make enquiry among my friends down town
                  to-morrow!"</p>
               <p>"You are very kind sir, but I beg you not to take trouble for me!"</p>
               <p>"It will be no trouble. I owe you an apology. I caused my daughter to dismiss you
                  as a teacher, because without any real reason but my own whims and prejudice I
                  formed a dislike to you. I will endeavor to repair my wrong by improving your
                  position here. In the meantime as a visitor I shall be very happy to see you!"</p>
               <p>"Sir you make my heart too full of gratitude or me to express all that I feel. The
                  past is forgotten and the future looks very bright for me!"</p>
               <p>Mr. Van Linden was so much pleased with his visitor that he ordered up a bottle of
                  choice old wine and the evening until a late hour was passed in pleasant
                  conversation, in which Magdalena modestly joined at times. But she was too happy
                  to say much, for she saw that her lover was winning the good opinion of her father
                  and that was enough for her. He never had seemed so intelligent, so thoroughly
                  well informed to her before and her own admiration grew stronger and stronger the
                  longer she listened to his manly voice.</p>
               <p>It was nearly midnight when Senor bade Mr. Van Linden and his daughter farewell
                  leaving them, not to go to his boarding house, but to meet the President of the
                  Club at a point selected by him in the afternoon, to report his success. In the
                  next chapter we will witness their interview.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
               <p>THE "Orphean Lunch" was the place where Senor Desmondo had agreed to meet the
                  President of his Club, to report progress, after his visits to the Millionaire and
                  his pretty, simple-hearted daughter.</p>
               <p>It was one of the many places on the west side of the city, which, kept open all
                  night, have but little custom in the day time, but a great deal at hours when the
                  laborer, or the honest man of toil, no matter what his position may be, is
                  enjoying the rest which tired nature demands.</p>
               <p>The principal room in the low, dingy brick house, was the long bar-room, occupying
                  the whole of the first floor—its bar well stocked with liquid poison, calculated
                  to kill at full Minnie-rifle range.</p>
               <p>There were private rooms above, which could be hired by anybody for "a
                  consideration," for any purpose, from opening a game of euchre to starting a
                  faro-bank—from a private interview with such parties as the President of the N. O.
                  C. and Senor Desmondo mondo, to an appointment between an aristocratic dame and a
                  Joseph, who was not so <emph>Josephistic</emph> as that stern youth of whom we all
                  have read—he who could not "see the point" to which wicked Mrs. Potiphar wished to
                  lead him.</p>
               <p>Passing into this house which, by the way, was kept by an active member of his
                  Club, Desmondo only cast a hasty glance at the heterogenous assembly at the bar,
                  or walking about the room, then he advanced to the proprietor, who with several
                  busy assistants was officiating behind the bar and he asked in a low tone if the
                  President had come.</p>
               <p>"Three hours ago!" replied the man. "He is up stairs in Number four, and I reckon
                  tired of waiting, for he has sent for four brandies in half an hour!"</p>
               <p>"Is he alone?" asked Desmondo.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, without he has got some of them <emph>invisible</emph> shadows there,
                  that seem to keep him posted on everything we do, and everything else that is
                  worth knowing. He is smarter than the devil, with them shadows to help him."</p>
               <p>"Send me up a drink from our private bottle!" said Desmondo quietly, and he passed
                  out of the bar-room and by a pair of stairs from the outside, in the rear of the
                  house, ascended to the second story of the house.</p>
               <p>Entering a narrow hall, from which doors opened to rooms on either side, he
                  knocked lightly, with three raps at Number Four.</p>
               <p>The door was instantly opened by the person whom he was looking for.</p>
               <p>"Come at last—I thought you had made up your mind to hang out all night!" said the
                  President in an impatient tone.</p>
               <p>"I couldn't get away any sooner!" said Desmondo. "I found that I was taking well
                  with old 'Yellow Bags,' and I knew that it would be folly for me to stop making
                  hay when the sun was shining, if I ever wanted to get hold of the gold-dust which
                  those same sacks are filled with.</p>
               <p>"So I staid and talked the old curse into the belief that I am a first-class <hi
                     rend="i"/>grandee, a considerable trifle too good to have to teach music for a
                  living. If I had only hinted that I would like to go into business, I'm certain
                  the old gent would set me up with a few thousands!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Thousands</emph> will not be our count, if he is as rich as you say! If
                  you're keen on the trail, you'll get the daughter fast as soon as possible, and
                  when once <emph>that</emph> knot is tied, we'll soon fix his flint. I have made a
                  new discovery. He has made a will and it is <emph>recorded!</emph> I have seen
                  it!"</p>
               <p>"Good! What does he say in it?"</p>
               <p>"He gives to his daughter Magdalena every dollar of his property, real and
                  personal, without any reservation!"</p>
               <p>"Oh Jericho! That sounds right. I see my way clear now. A secret marriage must
                  make her mine before a week is out. Then he must slip his cable and make sail out
                  of this world, to leave room for his betters in the golden port which he is dozing
                  in!"</p>
               <p>"Yes—that must be done! And then, Desmondo, we can carry out the plan which we
                  have jointly formed for our own safety and elevation beyond the dangers which now
                  surround us! You and I have got over a million of dollars now of the Club treasure
                  in our own hands. With what we can make out of the Van Linden speculation, we will
                  be in a position to let our Club slide on <choice>
                     <sic>its its</sic>
                     <corr>its</corr>
                  </choice> own runners, while we go abroad and in other lands buy titles of
                  nobility and close our lives like princes!"</p>
               <p>"Hark—speak low! There is somebody in the next room!"</p>
               <p>"Yes—there is a man and a woman in there, drinking champagne, for I heard them
                  talking and laughing and heard the pop of the corks. But they cannot hear what we
                  say, for they were talking quite loud a while ago and I listened to catch what
                  they were saying—but I could not distinguish a word! The walls are too thick!"</p>
               <p>"All right, then—but we must be careful, for if the members of the Club knew, or
                  were in any way to get even a <emph>hint</emph> that we are going to double on
                  them, they'd block our game, and we'd slip up before we could be <hi rend="i"
                  />domino, you see!"</p>
               <p>"No danger—<unclear>we were not</unclear> suspected. They<pb n="20-21"
                     xml:id="VAC6970-00000011"/> are all implicit believers in our faith to them, I
                  think!"</p>
               <p>"All but that fellow Stanley. He is such an infernal villain himself, that he
                  thinks every one else is like him, only not half so smart. We must get rid of him,
                  or he'll give us trouble yet. His eyes are too keen to suit me!"</p>
               <p>"Cannot we plan some way to get him into a scrape and then let him suffer without
                  helping him out of it?"</p>
               <p>"No—that would never do, he would blow on the club and have us all in quod in less
                  than no time, to save himself. It was a bad move even to admit such a man into our
                  circle. He is a slippery customer—if he had not been he would have swung on a
                  hempen neck-tie before this!"</p>
               <p>"What can we do to get rid of him?"</p>
               <p>"Let him taste steel some dark night, soon, and then do as we have done with other
                  annoyances—drop him into the Hudson when a good ebb-tide is setting out toward the
                  sea!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and it must be done soon—before I risk my last move with the little Van
                  Linden. If you're agreed I'll manage it in a day or two. You know he has a passion
                  for diamonds. I'll get him to go and see some that 'a gentleman in distress' has
                  for sale and when I got him where I want him, I'll make him see <emph>stars</emph>
                  instead!"</p>
               <p>"Well, do it, only be careful and not let him get wind of any harm intended. If he
                  does, our game is up!"</p>
               <p>"I'll be cautious—as smooth as a cat, until I show my claws. Ah, there comes my
                  today; I'll take that and we'll adjoin."</p>
               <p>"All right. I feel like taking a stroll among the concert cribs. They'll not close
                  for an hour or two yet, and we may pick up some flats there yet!"</p>
               <p>"Agreed—I'm with you!" said Desmondo, drinking off the liquor which a waiter had
                  just handed in.</p>
               <p>Then the two "<emph>gentlemen</emph>" lighted cigars and left the room.</p>
               <p>We will leave it too, only to see who the gentleman and lady, or the man and woman
                  are who occupy the <emph>next</emph> room.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
               <p>NUMBER six was the room next to number four, and in it during all the time that
                  number four had been occupied that evening, had been two persons who will prove
                  important characters in this story.</p>
               <p>One was a man, dressed in the very height of fashion, with all the rings,
                  watch-guard and charms, as well as the diamond breastpin which ultra dandyism
                  demands in Gotham, if it means to hold a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bon-ton</foreign>
                  position. He looked to be twenty-five years or thirty, though fifty would be
                  nearer his age. And, the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">artiste</foreign> had helped him
                  to make himself as much younger as possible.</p>
               <p>His curling hair, his carefully trimmed beard and moustache, even his pencilled
                  eyebrows were glossy with care and oil—his face shewed not a wrinkle, and was rosy
                  with health, or yet more likely with Doctor Gouraud's universal beautifier—his
                  whole make-up such as would have passed him as "A 1," on the Broadway Promenade,
                  or at the opera.</p>
               <p>In figure, as in dress, genteel, there was nothing more noticeable than his eye.
                  It was in color a dark hazel, but small and fiery, more like the eye of a serpent,
                  than that of a human being.</p>
               <p>His companion was a large, well-built haughty looking woman, who, in face, looked
                  as if there was more of animal nature than of angelic purity about her. She too
                  was dressed in the height of fashion, and diamonds glittered on her fingers, as
                  well as in her ears.</p>
               <p>She was older than he—one of those women, however, who never appear to be over
                  thirty, though many a year may have passed since they were really of that
                  age—women who never get very old!</p>
               <p>Before the President of the "N. O. C." arrived, they had entered the room, and
                  sent for champagne—a couple of bottles. When a bottle of this was opened the
                  gentleman had merely touched the glass to his lips, the lady had emptied the
                  goblet And while he took an occasional quiet sip, she took glass after glass until
                  the bottle was emptied. Her spirits rose as the effervescing liquid in the bottle
                  went down, and quiet as the gentleman was, her laughs and rallying witticisms
                  began to raise his spirits somewhat.</p>
               <p>"Cal," said he, after one of her most boisterous rallies, "don't make quite so
                  much noise! There's a party either in the next room now, or to be soon there, who
                  is to meet another person, and I want to hear what they have to say. I got wind of
                  their appointment here, and I asked you to come and take a bottle or two of wine
                  with me to cloak my real business."</p>
               <p>"Well, on my word, that is complimentary, Mr. Stanley!" said the lady, with a look
                  of impatience, if not of anger. "You make me believe you think enough of my
                  company to invite me to join you in an hour or two of pleasure, yet then coolly
                  tell me you only invite me here to cloak your own business!"</p>
               <p>"Don't get mad, my dear Cal; you know that I think the world and all of you!" said
                  Mr. Stanley. "But it is a life and a death matter, yes, and a heavy money interest
                  too, in which you will be no looser, which makes me wish to hear all which goes on
                  in the next room when the two persons meet who made the appointment of which I
                  speak!"</p>
               <p>"Money to be made, and <emph>I</emph> interested? Then, my dear Stanley, I'll be
                  as still as—as—a poor, weak, quiet little woman of one hundred and eighty can be,
                  whose tongue works upon a pivot, as the tongues of all truly interested women do!
                  But how are you to hear anything from the next room through these thickly
                  plastered and papered walls?"</p>
               <p>"I'll show you, Cal, if you'll keep the secret!"</p>
               <p>"A secret? I <emph>can</emph> keep it, I suppose, but it will be a terrible
                  hardship! You men can never, never know what suffering a poor weak woman endures
                  who has a secret upon her mind which she cannot impart to her nearest and dearest
                  friends! But what is it? Tell me quick—I am dying with impatience!"</p>
               <p>"You will not reveal it?"</p>
               <p>"No, dear Stanley, not without I tell it in sleep!"</p>
               <p>"Then look here!"</p>
               <p>Stanley walked up to a very <choice>
                     <sic>voluputous</sic>
                     <corr>voluptuous</corr>
                  </choice> picture of a lady in Persian costume, reclining upon an Ottoman, and
                  moving it slightly from its place in the wall, exhibited a portion of the wall,
                  three or four inches square, broken through entirely. With a penknife blade he
                  pushed at some obstruction behind, very gently, and the lady standing near him,
                  distinctly heard a person walking in the next room. She was about to speak, but a
                  sign of caution from Stanley sealed her lips until he had replaced the picture
                  over the hole.</p>
               <p>"I made that aperture on purpose and it has served me many times in cases like
                  this! Keep as quiet as you can now, for it must be nearly time that the
                  appointment was kept!"</p>
               <p>"Well—open me another bottle of wine—if I must be still, I must be doing. I wish I
                  had a dear sweet novel to read—something that would make me cry. It is so hard for
                  me to be serious when I've nothing to do. But I suppose I'm like all other
                  women!"</p>
               <p>Mr. Stanley did not reply, but he went to his ear-hole and listened.</p>
               <p>"The other one has come!" he said in a whisper. "Now I will find out their game A
                  part of it I know and can see through—the rest I <emph>must</emph> know and if
                     <emph>they</emph> are not foiled, my hatred is worth nothing now-a-days. It
                  used to be good enough to ruin the proudest!"</p>
               <p>And he motioned her to a seat, while with a countenance as set as if his face had
                  been turned to marble he listened to every word which was exchanged between
                  Desmondo and his friend.</p>
               <p>When their interview was over, and they had left Number Four, and not till then,
                  did he leave his post.</p>
               <p>His face, which all this time had been pale and rigid, now changed to a deep
                  purple. He was almost choked with anger.</p>
               <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6970-00000012"/>
               <p>"So they distrust me and nave the temerity to plan my death to get me out of their
                  way. I think I'll buy the diamonds which Senor Desmondo wishes to exhibit to me,
                  but I will borrow his heart's blood to pay for them with! Yes—Senor Desmondo, you
                  shall learn that Benedict Arnold Stanley is your master. Come Cal. my love, we
                  have nothing further to remain for, and I have a busy night before me. Senor
                  Desmondo may find that he cannot marry an heiress as easily as he supposes! I will
                  put a flea in the ear of the old gentleman whose fair favor he thinks he has
                  gained!"</p>
               <p>And Stanley with his female friend at once left the room.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
               <p>ANOTHER day had dawned upon the characters in our drama of real life.</p>
               <p>Mr. Linden Van Linden, after breakfasting with his pretty daughter, had walked
                  down to Wall street, for the day was very fine, the air clear and bracing, and he
                  knew exercise in such weather was beneficial to his health and vastly excellent
                  for promoting his digestive powers.</p>
               <p>He was in an excellent humor when he arrived at his office, as his clerks saw in a
                  moment by the kind and cheerful tone with which he responded to their morning
                  salutations before he entered his private office.</p>
               <p>He had been in the latter room but a very few moments, when one of the clerks came
                  to him and announced that a gentleman, a stranger, who said that it was not
                  necessary to give his name since Mr. Van Linden did not know him, wished to see
                  him immediately on very important business.</p>
               <p>"Admit him, but keep within call, should I need you!" said Mr. Van Linden as he
                  quickly closed the large safe which he had just opened and took his accustomed
                  seat in a huge arm-chair near his desk.</p>
               <p>In a minute the clerk returned and ushered in the same person whom we saw last in
                  room Number Five of the Orphean Club House—knowing him then as Benedict Arnold
                  Stanley.</p>
               <p>Mr. Van Linden, in the most dignified manner, returned the obsequious bow made by
                  his visitor, and pointing to a chair, waited for him to open his business.</p>
               <p>"I have the honor of addressing Mr. Van Linden, I believe!" said Stanley, as he
                  took the seat.</p>
               <p>"You have? said the former, in a reserved tone.</p>
               <p>"I do not mention my name, sir, for two reasons," said Stanley. "First, because
                  not knowing me it will be of no use whatever to you—secondly, because I am about
                  to run a terrible risk in imparting to you the very important information which I
                  am about to give you. If the parties of whom I shall speak should learn who put
                  you upon your guard against their machinations to rob you of your property and
                  even more, and then to murder you, my life would be taken in spite of all earthly
                  power to prevent it."</p>
               <p>"Me to be robbed and killed? Man, are you crazy?" cried the millionaire, as he
                  drew back with a kind of nervous shudder from the immediate vicinity of the person
                  who made this startling statement.</p>
               <p>"No, sir, I am fully possessed of my reason and will soon demonstrate it, if you
                  will pledge yourself not to inform the persons whom I shall expose of the source
                  of your information."</p>
               <p>"I will accept that proposition on the sole condition that your information proves
                  correct," replied Mr. Van Linden, recovering his usual self composure, and
                  scanning his visitor from head to foot.</p>
               <p>"Very well, sir. You have a daughter, Magdalena."</p>
               <p>"Yes—what of her, what of her, Sir? She is a good girl, sir—a lady, sir."</p>
               <p>"Yes sir, pure and innocent now as an angel," replied Stanley. "But were the plans
                  to succeed which I come to put you on your guard against, she would soon be lost
                  to you."</p>
               <p>"What the devil do you mean, man? what is it? Speak out and let me know what you
                  are coming at."</p>
               <p>"I will sir, as soon as I reach my point. You have made a will, giving this
                  daughter all of your property, real and personal, after your death."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, who told you that?"</p>
               <p>"I heard it from the lips of one who intends to marry her secretly and then to put
                  you out of the way so that he can get hold of your immense property!" said
                  Stanley, meeting the searching gaze of the old gentleman unflinchingly.</p>
               <p>"Man do not speak any longer in riddles. Speak out plainly—name the parties and
                  the plans distinctly, and if there is any truth in your statements and you want
                  pay for your information, you shall have it!" cried Mr. Van Linden
                  impatiently.</p>
               <p>"I wish no pay sir—the consciousness of doing a good action is all the reward I
                  ask!"</p>
               <p>"Well—well, go on with your explanation! If I or mine are in danger I ought to
                  know it. Go on sir—go on!"</p>
               <p>"You know a man who pretends to be a Spanish exile and calls himself Senor
                  Desmondo?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes—what of him?"</p>
               <p>"He is no more a Spaniard than yourself, sir—only a well educated villain, the
                  second in command of an organized club of thieves, burglars, murderers and
                  incendiaries, whose whole business is that of victimising every one whom they can,
                  outside of their own gang!"</p>
               <p>"You can prove this—you can prove it, man?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, circumstantially at first, but even stronger proof shall be forthcoming. But
                  I must ask one more pledge—do not reveal this matter to your daughter, while you
                  take measures for her protection, for if she knew it, Desmondo once on his guard
                  would find me out and I should lose my <unclear/> for the gang is desperate and
                     <unclear>power-</unclear>
               </p>
               <p>"Well, well, she shall know nothing of it. Give me the circumstantial proof."</p>
               <p>"I will, sir, from the boasts which I heard from the lips of this Desmondo,
                  himself. Learning that your daughter was your heiress, he managed in some way to
                  get introduced to her as a Spanish nobleman, who had been driven from his country
                  for his political opinions, and had here, through poverty, been reduced to the
                  necessity of giving music lessons to secure a living."</p>
               <p>"Yes, that is true so far."</p>
               <p>"Thus daily admitted to her presence, he used every art to gain her sympathy and
                  pity, and, sir, the woman who once pities, will soon love."</p>
               <p>"Well, well go on—go on sir."</p>
               <p>He has won her love. She has confessed it to him. You detected him when he was
                  kissing her hand. You ordered her to dismiss him. She did so, but at the same time
                  she told him to come and visit her as a <emph>friend,</emph> but not as a music
                  master. Told him too the hours when you were sure to be absent, so that his visits
                  would not be interrupted."</p>
               <p>"Man, I do not believe you. My child would not be so treacherous,
                     <emph>could</emph> not be. This is a <emph>lie</emph> you are concocting to
                  extort money from me."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Van Linden, have I not refused all offer of recompense for my information?
                  You have called me a <emph>liar</emph>—read that sir."</p>
               <p>And Stanley handed to Mr. Van Linden the very letter of dismissal which Magdalena
                  had written to Desmondo.</p>
               <p>The old gentleman read it and his face grew black with anger.</p>
               <p>"Curse her—curse her, a traitor in my own child." he cried, as he rose to his
                  feet</p>
               <p>"Am I a liar now, sir?" asked Stanley with a sarcastic smile.</p>
               <p>"No—no, sir. Pardon me for my haste and folly in so addressing you. Where did you
                  get this letter?"</p>
               <p>"A woman whom this Desmondo has deceived and betrayed, and who is jealous of him,
                  abstracted it from his pocket and brought it to me."</p>
               <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6970-00000013"/>
               <p>"It is genuine—it is the writing of my daughter," said the old gentleman with a
                  heavy sigh. "But I will block her game. I will put her in a nunnery where no man
                  can lead her astray. But go on with your story, sir. You said this man intended
                  when he had secured my daughter to murder me."</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, smooth and plausible as he was at your house last night, when he was
                  trying to win his way into your good graces, he was planning the abduction of your
                  daughter, a secret marriage with her, and then your immediate murder, so that the
                  property would be hers before you could alter your will."</p>
               <p>"Monstrous! How did you know of his visit last night?"</p>
               <p>"From his own boasting lips! He thinks me a friend, and reveals all his plans to
                  me!"</p>
               <p>"And what are you in reality, sir?"</p>
               <p>"A New York detective, sir, bent upon the duty of breaking up this terrible gang
                  of criminals!"</p>
               <p>"God speed you in your efforts, I am satisfied from your knowledge of so many
                  circumstances, known also to me, that all of your information is true. And while I
                  ask your aid to defeat this accursed conspiracy, I must request you to receive
                  recompense for your trouble!"</p>
               <p>"Not a cent, sir—not a cent for worlds!" said Stanley, as energetically as if he
                  was indeed an honest man, instead of being a traitor as well as a thief. "I am a
                  servant of law and justice, and am only doing my duty in protecting the innocent
                  and foiling the intentions of the wicked."</p>
               <p>"You are a noble fellow, and you shall never regret the course you have taken,"
                  said Mr. Van Linden, taking the hand of Stanley and pressing it warmly. "I hope
                  you will aid me to carry this matter through, and help me to punish the
                  villains."</p>
               <p>"Certainly I will, if you will be guided by me in your movements."</p>
               <p>"To be sure, I will. You will best know how to foil them, being acquainted with
                  their plans. I will act entirely under your guidance. What do you propose as my
                  first step?"</p>
               <p>"To write to this fellow, Desmondo, that you know his real character, and his
                  whole career as well as it is known to Judge Russell, whom he fears more than any
                  one in the city, for he has already served out one sentence from that judge, and
                  he knows that the judge never lets up on a second offence. To tell him that you
                  have put a watch on the rooms of the "N. O. C." and its haunts will be broken
                  up."</p>
               <p>"What is the 'N. O. C.' as you call it?"</p>
               <p>"The club to which Desmondo belongs. He is its Vice-President. Say nothing to your
                  daughter, only never let her go out without her attendants, who can prevent her
                  having a secret interview with this man, and who will shoot him down if, in his
                  desperation, he tries to abduct her."</p>
               <p>"Good—I like your plans, and will follow them up."</p>
               <p>"So do, and we will soon succeed in bringing the whole gang to justice, and your
                  amiable, but too simple-hearted daughter will be saved from a terrible fate."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes. Noble fellow, I shall study all my life how to reward you. Meet me to
                  night at my house, at ten o'clock, after my daughter has retired, and let me know
                  how matters proceed."</p>
               <p>I will, sir; but do not delay in writing to Desmondo. I will try to be near him
                  when he receives the letter, and see how he acts. I can then learn what he intends
                  to do, and we'll be prepared to meet him as he deserves."</p>
               <p>"Yes—yes, you are right on every point."</p>
               <p>"I will try to be, sir. But I must go now."</p>
               <p>And Stanley rose and left, attended to the door by Mr. Van Linden.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
               <p>MR. BENEDICT ARNOLD STANLEY, at four o'clock in the afternoon of the same day upon
                  which he had his interview with Mr. Van Linden, watched the post office carrier as
                  on his afternoon route he carried a letter to the house where Desmondo boarded. He
                  knew that the letter was from Mr. Van Linden, and contained elements which would
                  raise a tempest in the breast of his enemy, and he wished if possible to see its
                  first effects.</p>
               <p>Watching the door of the house closely after the carrier left the letter, he soon
                  had the satisfaction of seeing, from his place of concealment behind the red
                  curtains of a neighboring porter house, Mr. Desmondo come out, his face pale with
                  rage, his form quivering with ill suppressed excitement, he hurried, with rapid,
                  nervous steps towards a billiard room down the avenue where he and the president
                  of the N. O. C. frequently met to play billiards and look out for "flats" as they
                  termed the unwary whom they could victimize.</p>
               <p>Stanley at once followed, for he wished to see the meeting between the two chiefs,
                  and to learn, if possible, their future movements. Not that he cared in the least
                  for either Mr. or Miss Van Linden, but because in foiling these men, he fed his
                  private vengeance and in weakening them, made them less powerful as enemies to
                  harm him.</p>
               <p>He picked up an acquaintance in the street and by offering him large odds on the
                  game induced him to go in and play with him, thus making a plausible excuse for
                  being where he could observe the actions of the two men.</p>
               <p>He took a table near where they were standing when he entered and appeared to be
                  so completely absorbed in the game which he immediately commenced that he could
                  not see or recognize a friend near him.</p>
               <p>They were so excited in perusing and reperusing the letter and commenting upon its
                  contents, that they really did not see <emph>him,</emph> or they would not have
                  talked over the matter so loud that he could hear every word they uttered.</p>
               <p>"Hell and fury!" was the first exclamation of the president of the club, whose
                  name we may as well now give to the reader. It was Gilbert Kanouse. "What does
                  this mean, Desmondo?"</p>
               <p>"It means some cursed treachery," said Desmondo. "Some one of our club must be
                  working against us, and he'd better be making his last will and testament if I
                  find him out."</p>
               <p>"Why do you think there is treachery in the club?"</p>
               <p>"Because there is no one outside of our own brotherhood who knows of the secrets
                  which old Van Linden has evidently found out."</p>
               <p>"That is so. We must hold a meeting and find out if we can, and punish the
                  traitor. But what will you do now?"</p>
               <p>"Abduct the girl and marry her in spite of him, and do it before he will think to
                  alter his will, and knock him in the head an hour afterwards, or have it done. I
                  must see her at any rate, and see her I will. Yes, in spite of him and his
                  threats, for I know she loves me and that is the best point in my favor."</p>
               <p>"Well, I suppose it is our only course now, and we must hurry up matters too, to
                  get through before he puts the police on our track. He is kind enough to say that
                  if we instantly leave the city, he will not prosecute or follow us up."</p>
               <p>"Well, I will write to him that we will leave and thus keep him still, whilst we
                  work to get him out of our way."</p>
               <p>"Yes, that is proper. Let us adjourn to your rooms."</p>
               <p>"Agreed."</p>
               <p>The two chiefs went out, so engrossed with their new trouble that they did not see
                  Stanley, even though they passed within a few feet of him.</p>
               <p>He smiled as he saw he had not been, noticed and closing his game as soon as
                  possible, wrote a note in a stationer's shop near by, detailing what he had seen
                  and heard, and despatched it to Mr. Van Linden.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
               <p>IT was the usual hour for Mr. Van Linden to return, and Magdalena stood at one of
                  the front parlor windows, watching for her father's carriage, for he always rode
                  home in the evening.</p>
               <p>It was the hour for his arrival and her eager eyes were glancing down the street
                  when she saw the stately form of her heart's new born idol, rapidly coming up the
                  street. Of course that idol could be none other than Senor Desmondo. She gazed
                  with glad and eager eyes, for she supposed of course that he was coming to visit
                  her. But as he approached she saw that his face looked pale and wretched and
                  making a gesture of sorrow, he raised a note in his hand, as if he wished her to
                  see it, and then passed hurriedly on.</p>
               <p>Surprised and terrified, she knew not what at, she watched him until he reached
                  the corner just above, where there was one of the iron U.S. Post Office boxes, and
                  she saw him drop the note in this, look back at her and then pass on.</p>
               <p>That something was wrong she felt instinctively, and yet all had seemed so bright,
                  only the night before. She had not long to ponder over what the cloud might be
                  whose chill shadow was already falling upon her young heart, for the carriage
                  containing her father drove up and in a minute more he, as quiet and calm as ever,
                  was taking her by the hand and returning the greeting kiss which always came from
                  her lips.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, my dear child?" said he, noticing that a look of anxiety was
                  settled on her face.</p>
               <p>"Oh father, I do not know!" she replied, with her usual artlessness. "The Senor
                  Desmondo passed here a few moments ago, looking so sad and wretched. He must have
                  heard some terrible news from Spain."</p>
               <p>The face of Mr. Van Linden darkened in an instant.</p>
               <p>"Girl. Never—never while you live utter that man's name in my presence again. A
                  villain, a thief, a graduate of the States prison; he would try to rob me of you,
                  and has even planned my murder," he cried with a vehemence so unusual in
                     <emph>him</emph>, and so wild and startling to <emph>her</emph>, that she
                  shrunk back from him, half fainting with terror.</p>
               <p>"Father—father, you know not what you say," she moaned, pressing her white hands
                  to her forehead as if in pain.</p>
               <p>"Yes, girl—yes, I know too well, and how <emph>you</emph>, instead of dismissing
                  him finally when I bade you do so, dismissed him only as your music teacher, but
                  invited him to visit you as a friend, naming the hours for his visits, when
                     <emph>I</emph>, your father, the guardian of your honor and your safety, would
                  be absent from home."</p>
               <p>"Oh, father—father."</p>
               <p>"Deny it not, ungrateful girl. Deny it not, for not only did he boast of it before
                  his dissolute and criminal companions, but he left your letter where a woman whom
                  he has betrayed and ruined, found it, and I now have it in my possession."</p>
               <p>"Oh mercy—mercy, my father. This cannot be real. I shall go mad."</p>
               <p>"Child, you have even told him that you <emph>loved</emph> him—him the felon and
                  jail bird Oh, better for you had died when your sainted mother went down into the
                  grave, <unclear>than</unclear> to have lived to bring this wretchedness upon the
                  unhappy father who has toiled so lard to amass almost a kingdom's wealth for you
                  to enjoy."</p>
               <p>"Oh father—father."</p>
               <p>"All this you know to be true, child. And now, hear me. Banish that man forever
                  from your mind. Never again must you look upon him—never again speak <choice>
                     <sic>of of</sic>
                     <corr>of</corr>
                  </choice> him to me. Disobey me and you shall go forth into the world homeless,
                  disinherited, and with my curse, aye, my <emph>curse!</emph> ringing in your
                  ears."</p>
               <p>"Oh, father, I will obey you; but I cannot believe that he could be so bad. He
                  seemed so good, so noble, so high-minded."</p>
               <p>"All hypocrisy, my girl. A baser villain does not exist. But he will soon receive
                  ceive his deserts. The eyes of the detective police are upon his every, action.
                  Through one of them I discovered his real character, and his hellish aims against
                  you and myself. I found the proofs too strong for doubt now, my daughter; yet,
                  dear, in spite of your folly, be wise and strong, and you will avoid the danger
                  which threatens you."</p>
               <p>"I will try, my father," sobbed Magdalena.</p>
               <p>Touched by her evident sorrow and deep feeling, Mr. Van Linden spoke to his child
                  even yet more tenderly, and led her to her own little favorite sitting-room and
                  ordered their dinner quietly served there instead of in the usual dining-room.</p>
               <p>Much as he loved gold—hard-hearted and worldly as men who knew not his inner
                  nature deemed him, there was an <emph>basis</emph> of true nature in the heart,
                  with barren surroundings, which throbbed in that old man's breast.</p>
               <p>And now we will leave him and Magdalena for a time.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
               <p>After Desmondo put the letter which he had written for Magdalena into the U. S.
                  Mail box, he hurried away to prepare himself for the carrying out of a plan to get
                  her entirely in his power. He knew that in some manner Mr. Van Linden had become
                  acquainted with his real character, and that it would never do for him to appear
                  at the Fifth Avenue Mansion in the same character by which he was now known
                  there.</p>
               <p>He also knew the nature of woman so well—her faithfulness in sorrow as well as in
                  joy, her unselfishness and devotion—that he had full faith in the love of
                  Magdalena, and did not believe that any mere report of his
                     <unclear>unworthiness,</unclear> not founded on the most
                     <unclear>incontrovertible</unclear> proof, would turn her away from loving him,
                  no matter what her father might do or say.</p>
               <p>In his letter to her he pleaded most earnestly for an interview, telling her that
                  his credit had been injured with her father by some foul conspiracy, that he could
                     <emph>prove</emph> his honor to be bright and and untarnished, and that his
                  love for her was so deep and intense that, if he must lose her, life would be such
                  a burden that he would cease to exist. With all the cunning of his nature he so
                  worded his letter as to reach and touch every sensitive chord of her heart and he
                  closed by praying her to keep his note a secret from all human beings, and to
                  grant him one interview, wherein, if it was to be a final farewell, he might at
                  least hear his condemnation from her lips rather than from the pen of her
                  father.</p>
               <p>He had purposely deposited this letter when she could see him do it, that she
                  might be sure to get it; for, of course, she would know that the communication was
                  from him for her and important, and would not rest until it was in her
                  possession.</p>
               <p>After leaving the letter he hurried to the shop of a Hebrew dealer in second-hand
                  clothing, who was well known to him and his Club, for, like many others of his
                  persuasion, he kept a "fence" or a repository for stolen goods of all kinds,
                  generally making only such advances on them as would leave him two or three
                  hundred per cent, profit.</p>
               <p>Senor Desmondo passed directly through the front room or store of Mr. Moses
                  Sheeny, as the Second-hand called himself, giving the proprietor a signal, as he
                  went by him, which the latter noticed and acknowledged, though he was busy in
                  attendance upon three or four customers of a not very prepossessing
                  appearance.</p>
               <p>Desmondo at once went into a small, office-like room in the rear of the store, and
                  there seated himself to await the appearance of the man whom, by a look, he had
                  summoned.</p>
               <p>He was not kept in suspense a great while. Mr. Moses Sheeny soon came into the
                  room. He was a weazel-eyed customer, with a thin, sharp-featured face, a hook nose
                  and a figure too thin and lank to fill out the thread-bare suit of black which
                  hung shabbily on it.</p>
               <p>"My coot frent, Senor Desmonto, vat is your pleasure mit me?" he said, bowing
                     very<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6970-00000015"/> low to his visitor. "I shall feel
                  very much honor mit your orders."</p>
               <p>"You must rig me up, Moses, in a disguise that will so alter my appearance that my
                  very best friend, the old Devil himself, would not know me!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, yesh, Senor, I see. The coppers are on your track, maybe?"</p>
               <p>"No, not so bad, not so rough as that, Moses. I have a big job on hand, and if I
                  can carry it through, I shall clear a full couple of millions of hard dollars by
                  it. But I must show up in a new character, you see, to do it."</p>
               <p>"A guppel of millions? Mine Cot in himmell. Senor—you means dat on de square?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, square with you, Moses; and if you'll help me in my disguise, and some other
                  details, I will see you well paid for your trouble."</p>
               <p>"Yesh—yesh—I see. You ish always very coot, Senor Desmonto, always very coot. Vat
                  kind of disguise you vant to make up mit? I've got everyding dat you can dink
                  of."</p>
               <p>"I shall want several changes, most likely. The first that I think of using will
                  be that of a returned Californian. I want to be well rigged-up in that line, for I
                  intend to sell some gold-dust down in Wall street, and, perhaps, to dispose of two
                  or three land-claims in the gold section."</p>
               <p>"Goot. I can fix you so dat California will stick out all over you—only you must
                  get de dirt on yourself. And den de creepers, too; de most of 'em have dem when
                  dey come back. But if dey have blenty of de dust it ish no matter for de dirt or
                  de creepers eider."</p>
               <p>"I'll try to keep clear of de creepers," said Desmondo, with a smile. "Get me up
                  the rig and a red wig; I can stain my beard a dirty yellow very easily. I will
                  dress here."</p>
               <p>Very coot. In ten minutes I'll have you all gompleet. But you must remember me,
                  Senor Desmondo. You must remember me, if you make out well in de pisness."</p>
               <p>"Certainly I will, my good Moses. You know I never fail my friends, or my foes
                  either, for the matter of that. If I make all I hope to, I'll give you enough to
                  enable you to retire from business."</p>
               <p>"Ah—dat would be coot. But when I stop from pisness, I must be more rich dan Yon
                  Yacob Astor. But dish talk is not pisness. I go und get you old clothes."</p>
               <p>And Moses at once went out to get the disguise needed by the chief villain of our
                  story.</p>
               <p>He soon returned with it, and a half hour afterwards, a long-haired,
                  yellow-bearded customer, with a broad-rimmed slouch hat, long boots, a good deal
                  the worse for wear, and clothes which had been patched with various cloths and
                  here and there a bit of buckskin, might have been seen leaving the establishment
                  of Mr. Sheeny, with a step and air as if he owned the fee-simple of the Central
                  Park and half the Fifth Avenue beside.</p>
               <p>No one who had seen the elegantly attired Senor Desmondo when he entered the shop
                  of Moses, would for an instant have suspected that disguise could have made him
                  into the rough-looking <choice>
                     <sic>costomer</sic>
                     <corr>customer</corr>
                  </choice> who now went out, a carpet bag in one hand and a huge cane in the other
                  with a head of gold-bearing quartz upon it as large as a goose-egg.</p>
               <p>Desmondo had shown great cunning in assuming that disguise, for on that very
                  evening a California steamer had arrived, with the usual quantity of returned
                  fortunates, some of them healthy and well, others with constitutions broken
                  down—fortunes made, it is true, but at the expense of life itself.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
               <p>Within an hour after the Senor Desmondo had left the crib of Moses Sheeny, in his
                  new disguise, he made his appearance at French's Hotel and there registered his
                  name as Charles Youngson, of Yuba River, California.</p>
               <p>Rough as he looked, he was received with very courtesy by the attachees of that
                  establishment tablishment—for they know so well how Californian patronage pays
                  that no guests are more welcome there than those who come from the Eldoradian
                  clime.</p>
               <p>The Saracenic-looking chief clerk, whose flowing beard is the envy of all
                  observers, hastened to look him out what he desired—a single room, as near to
                  terra-firma as possible—a polite servant informed him that a barber shop and
                  bathing establishment was connected with the house, while a third informed him
                  that very fine clothing stores were within a minute's walk of the door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Youngson, however, paid but little heed to all of this information. He ordered
                  "a slug" of good brandy to be sent to his room, and retired—much to the
                  disappointment of sundry dealers in gloves, socks, pocket-handkerchiefs, and cheap
                  jewelry, as well as to the chagrin of some pretty Oneida squaws, who, with any
                  quantity of bead-work on hand, were waiting to sell out to the "rich
                  Californians," as they generally did when a Pacific passenger-ship came into
                  port.</p>
               <p>Mr. Youngson got his brandy soon after he reached his room, and, dismissing the
                  servant, with the remark that he was about tired out, and would be in bed in ten
                  minutes, he closed and locked his door with the air of one who meant to take his
                  "forty winks of sleep" or more without being disturbed.</p>
               <p>He then quietly sipped his brandy-and-water for a little while, but seemed like
                  doing anything but retiring to rest for he rose from time to time and went to his
                  door and listened as if he expected a visitor.</p>
               <p>About an hour after he had been in his room, a quiet step approached his door, and
                  a low knock, thrice repeated, gave him notice that a visitor had arrived.</p>
               <p>"Who is there?" he asked in a low tone, as he stepped to the door.</p>
               <p>"A sleepless bird," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"An N. O. is sleepless," he answered.</p>
               <p>"Yes, in the night," was the response.</p>
               <p>This seemed to satisfy him, for he at once opened the door and admitted the
                  visitor, who, though disguised on this occasion with a false beard and head of
                  hair, was instantly recognized as his friend and associate, the president of the
                  N. O. C.</p>
               <p>"Did any one see you come up?" asked Desmondo, as the other stepped lightly into
                  the room.</p>
               <p>"No, not a soul, I think. I had the luck to slip up when a small row was going on
                  in the bar-room, raised purposely by a couple of ours, and here I am."</p>
               <p>"Good! what do you think of my disguise?"</p>
               <p>"It is capital. Only by your voice would I know you."</p>
               <p>"I hardly know myself. Did you write to old Van Linden, according to our
                  plan?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; he will receive a letter early in the morning, stating that Senor Desmondo
                  and the President of his club have left the United States forever."</p>
               <p>"All right, so far. Have you yet any clue to the person whose enmity has come so
                  near foiling us in our designs for the future?"</p>
               <p>"A clue. Yes, but nothing positive. I have learned, by bribing a servant, that Mr.
                  Van Linden has had two or three stolen and private interviews with a person whose
                  description answers exactly to the appearance of that fellow, Stanley."</p>
               <p>"Just as I expected. He is the only man in our club whose treachery I have
                  dreaded. If we can throw him off our track until we can hush his voice forever,
                  our game will be safe enough. He must be made to think that we have indeed left
                  the country, and then we can work for him, when he will not be on his guard
                  against us."</p>
               <p>"That will be easily done, if the disguise you have for me will conceal my
                  identity as well as that which you have chosen."</p>
               <p>"We will soon see," said Desmondo, proceeding to unlock his carpet-bag, and taking
                  from it a suit very similar to his own.</p>
               <p>Into this the President of the N. O. C. hastened to put himself, and in a little
                  while he was almost as completely transformed into a Californian as his second in
                  command.</p>
               <p>After a change had been made in the color of his hair and beard, he so lost all<pb
                     n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6970-00000016"/> resemblance to his former self that
                  Desmondo was fully satisfied that no member of their club would ever recognize
                  them, no matter where they were met.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
               <p>Another day is shining upon the pathway of our story. Mr. Van Linden, who had
                  received a letter stating that Desmondo and his friend had accepted his conditions
                  and left the country to avoid prosecution, went down to his office in Wall street
                  with quite a contented heart, thinking that he had triumphed over the villains who
                  had threatened his peace and endangered his daughter's safety.</p>
               <p>According to a promise previously made, Benedict Arnold Stanley called upon the
                  old gentleman at twelve precisely of that day.</p>
               <p>The <choice>
                     <sic>millionare</sic>
                     <corr>millionaire</corr>
                  </choice> greeted him warmly when he entered his office.</p>
               <p>"You are very welcome," said he. "I am satisfied that the information which you
                  gave me was correct, because the two leading villains whom you named have left,
                  because I threatened their arrest and prosecution if they remained."</p>
               <p>"Left the country, do you think," said Stanley, with a quiet smile.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I have a letter from them saying that ere it reaches me, they will be afloat
                  on the ocean, bound to another hemisphere."</p>
               <p>"I will believe that they have gone when I see them embarked on an ocean-bound
                  ship, or when they are no longer in any disguise, not seen at the meetings of the
                  club to which they belong. I will attend it myself, night after night, and if they
                  are there, so matter how they are disguised, I shall know them."</p>
               <p>"So do; and if they yet remain in the country, they shall be followed to the
                  death, if money can aid justice in securing and punishing them."</p>
               <p>"Money can aid hate in crushing them if they are where hate can reach them," said
                  Stanley, bitterly. "They have planned <emph>my</emph> death; if I cannot compass
                  theirs, mine is not the power and the cunning which I believe I possess."</p>
               <p>"Well, my good friend, draw on me for funds when you need them," said Mr. Van
                  Linden. "Lest you should doubt my will in the matter, accept this check for a
                  thousand dollars, for present use."</p>
               <p>And the millionaire drew a check for the amount named.</p>
               <p>"How does your daughter bear the information that Desmondo is a hypocrite and a
                  villain," asked Stanley, as he pocketed the check.</p>
               <p>"At first she would not believe it; now, since I have received the letter to which
                  I just alluded, she seems to be convinced of the truth of what I told her."</p>
               <p>"Has not Desmondo sought an interview with her."</p>
               <p>"I think not. If he did, she would inform me of it. She is on her guard now, and
                  will not be led astray."</p>
               <p>"I hope not, sir; but let me reiterate my former advice. Do not let her go from
                  your house at any time without an escort sufficient to guard her against a
                  forcible abduction, and sufficiently faithful to inform you if she should by any
                  of Desmondo's cunning be induced to grant him an interview, if he is yet, as I
                  believe, in the country, and determined upon carrying out his first plans."</p>
               <p>"All this I have provided for," said Mr. Van Linden.</p>
               <p>"Then I do not know that it will be possible for him to succeed, if he yet
                  remains. My eyes will, however, be watchfully awake all the time in the matter,
                  and the first sign that I discover of treachery shall be made known to you."</p>
               <p>"All right, my good friend. I confide in you. And now you must excuse my closing
                  our interview, as I have some monetary business down at the Exchange, which must
                  be attended to."</p>
               <p>"Certainly, sir. I will leave, but will call again if, at any moment, I learn of
                  any news which will be important to you."</p>
               <p>And Mr. Stanley left the office of the millionaire, considerably elated with his
                  success so far.</p>
               <p>He did not notice, as he passed out and up the street, a pair of keen eyes which
                  glared fiercely upon him as he moved along.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
               <p>It was about the same hour at which her father was holding his interview with
                  Stanley in Wall street, that Magdalena sat in her chamber, her eyes red and
                  swollen with weeping, her heart filled with the weight of her new sorrow, her mind
                  so unsettled that she knew not what to do.</p>
               <p>Her father had strictly ordered her not to leave the house until his return, and
                  especially not to hold any communication with others than those of his own
                  household, pleading as his reason for such strict orders, that she was in some
                  great danger—he hardly knew how great—from the machinations of the gang of which
                  Desmondo was one of the heads.</p>
               <p>"Oh, it cannot, it cannot be true. Desmondo is not the villain they make him out
                  to be. My heart tells me that he is the victim of some deep conspiracy," she
                  murmured.</p>
               <p>Her soliloquy was interrupted by the entrance of a servant with a letter which, he
                  said, had just been left for her by the city postman.</p>
               <p>She glanced at the superscription, and her heart beat wildly as she thought she
                  recognized his handwriting.</p>
               <p>Dismissing the servant, she tore open the envelope, and in a moment was eagerly
                  reading what her yearning heart most wished to believe, his protestations of
                  innocence, his assurance of truth and devotion, his oaths that, if he lost her, he
                  would also lose a life that would be worthless and a burden if not shared with
                  her.</p>
               <p>"I knew it was false," she murmured as she pressed the precious lie to her lips.
                  "I knew that he was true, and that, as he dreaded, the enemies who have followed
                  him with persecution, had tried to tear him from me. But they shall not succeed.
                  Father or no father, inherited or disinherited, I will not be untrue to him who
                  suffers so much for me.</p>
               <p>"He wishes me to meet him, and informs me that at midnight, this night, he will be
                  on the street opposite our house, in a strange disguise, which no prying eyes can
                  penetrate. When he sees me, if I will silently steal forth to meet him, he will
                  speak, and I shall know him; and then, if he fails to convince me of his truth and
                  honor, I can bid him farewell forever, and he will seek in the grave a mercy and
                  peace which he cannot find on earth.</p>
               <p>"I will meet him. I know but two things:—He is innocent and I love him What more
                  care I to know? I will not be a willing tool to aid in his destruction, to assist
                  in adding to his wretchedness. He shall learn that there is one true and faithful
                  heart on earth, if all the rest are false and cruel.</p>
               <p>"He says I must destroy his letter. I cannot. It must rest next my heart until
                  that heart is pressed against his noble bosom."</p>
               <p>And the fond, believing girl concealed the letter in her bosom, and proceeded to
                  wash away the tear marks upon her lovely cheeks. The rain of her heart-storm was
                  over for that day.</p>
               <p>Ah me, how trusting is woman until treachery awakens her from Love's fond
                  dream.</p>

               <p>When the treacherous villain, Stanley left the office of Mr. Van Linden in Wall
                  street, he glanced cautiously around to see if he had been followed or watched by
                  any of the members of the "N. O. C." He saw no one whom he recognized. Little did
                  he think that from under the slouched rim of an old California hat there was bent
                  upon him an angry glance of recognition at that moment.</p>
               <p>But such was the case.</p>
               <p>He had been tracked, and, at last, Senor Desmondo knew who it was that had
                  informed Mr. Van Linden of his true character and of the nature of his
                  intentions.</p>

                  our story quietly sauntered on up the street, close in Stanley's wake, until the
                  latter turned up Nassau street and entered another office, which Desmondo knew to
                  be kept by a man whose ostensible calling was that of a broker, but whose real
                  business was the selling of lottery tickets and policies.</p>
               <p>"He has been paid for his treachery, and is going to invest the price of it," said
                  Desmondo, in a low tone. "I will follow him no further now; he will be here at
                  four o'clock, when the drawings come in. He can be looked after then by those who
                  will not let him up easily. I will go and see if I cannot invest something on my
                  own account. My letters of credence are all O. K., and I will have a talk with my
                  intended father-in-law, just for the fun of the thing."</p>

                  </choice> down Wall street once more.</p>
               <p>Ten minutes afterwards, Mr. Van Linden was informed by one of his clerks that a
                  Mr. Youngson, of California, wished to see him on business.</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>Business</emph> was a magic pass-word there, and Mr. Van Linden at once
                  ordered this visitor to be admitted.</p>
               <p>He had seen Californians before and had profited in his dealings with them;
                  therefore he was in no way surprised at the uncouth figure or rough looks of the
                  Mr. Youngson who came in, and, without even taking off his old slouched hat, took
                  a chair, near the table, and, drawing forth a huge greasy-looking pocket-book,
                  took from it a couple of letters which he tossed over, rather than handed to
                  him.</p>
               <p>The millionaire opened the letters and a grim smile of satisfaction passed over
                  his cold and calculating face.</p>
               <p>"From my most esteemed friends and correspondents, Wells, Fargo &amp; Co," he
                  said, as he glanced at the first. Then looking at the second, he added, "and this
                  from Lafayette Shelby, of the Tuoleme district—a good and true man. You come to me
                  well recommended, Mr. Youngson; what can I do for you?"</p>
               <p>"Tell me how best to dispose of a hundred and fifty pounds of gold dust, first;
                  and then how to invest most profitably the proceeds of that, and these
                  certificates o deposit from Wells, Fargo &amp; Co, redeemable here in gold," said
                  the pretended Mr. Youngson, bluntly, exhibiting his certificate amounting to over
                  a hundred thousand dollars.</p>
               <p>"Send the dust to the U. S. Mint to be essayed and coined; you will be treated
                  fair and square there!" said Mr. Van Linden quietly. "And hold on to your money,
                  all of it, for the present, and be prepared to invest, in a few weeks, every
                  dollar of it in real estate and you will realize half a million. Real estate and
                  everything else has got up to the highest notch on the scale of speculation. There
                  must be and there will be, in a very short time, a terrible revulsion. I can see
                  it plainly and am myself preparing to meet and to take advantage of it. Everything
                  but money will go down—down lower than it has ever gone before in this country.
                  When it is down, buy all the solid property you can; for it will rise to an
                  equitable standard when the revulsion is past, and you will have tangible,
                  rent-paying, interest-paying property. I advise you as the friend of my friends,
                  whom you come so well recommended by."</p>
               <p>"Good, I thank you, I'm a rough customer, and don't use many words. If you like,
                  I'll deposit with you for the present."</p>
               <p>"Very well, sir, I shall be happy to take charge of your funds; where do you stop
                  in the city?"</p>
               <p>"At French's Hotel for the present. When I get shaved and rigged-up and look a
                  little more presentable, I shall change to the Fifth Avenue. As I look now the
                  guests there might turn up their noses at me."</p>
               <p>"Not if they know the value of your bank account, Mr. Youngson. The
                     <emph>ability</emph> to possess fine clothes, jewelry, and all that, is just as
                  good a passport to society in this city as if you wore the articles themselves.
                  People would not call you rough or rude or uncouth if they knew you to be wealthy;
                  they would only say that you were <emph>eccentric</emph>."</p>
               <p>"Yes; eccentricity is a very good name for bearishness. Well, Mr. Van Linden, I do
                  not intend to make a show of my eccentricity for any great length of time. When I
                  get my funds safely deposited I shall shed this rough mining costume and try to
                  look as I did once when I was rather poor, but known to the world in general and
                  my friends in particular as a gentleman."</p>

               <p>WHEN Desmondo, under his disguise as a Californian, returned to his hotel, after
                  his very satisfactory visit to Mr. Van Linden, he found the President of the "N.
                  O. C." at his room, waiting for him, although he too had been out on business
                  connected with their mutual plans of operation.</p>
               <p>"I have discovered the traitor who exposed me to Van Linden!" said Desmondo, as he
                  threw himself into a chair.</p>
               <p>"Was it Stanley, as he expected?" asked the other.</p>
               <p>"Yes. I saw him come out of Van Linden's office, and followed him to a
                  lottery-dealer's crib, where he is sure to go again when the drawings arrive at
                  four o'clock. We want after that to have him followed up until we can find a safe
                  chance to check his career and to punish his treachery!"</p>
               <p>"That must soon be done, for he will not halt now in his rascality to us,
                  especially if he knows that we suspect him; and he will not fail to know it at the
                  next meeting of the club!"</p>
               <p>"We had better settle his case this very night!"</p>
               <p>"I think so too, but you must attend to that, for I have to meet Magdalena, if she
                  keeps the appointment I have made; and if she will agree to an immediate marriage,
                  you know that it will not be my policy to refuse it!"</p>
               <p>"Of course not; and when that takes place, the old man must have no time left to
                  alter his will. Stanley is too small game to be allowed to stand in our way! There
                  are men in the Club who will take care of him, while we attend to more important
                  business. But he must not be neglected for even a single night; for we know not
                  how far he has gone already. He knows secrets which we may well feel anxious to
                  keep to ourselves. The Club must be warned of his conduct, and when he enters the
                  Club-house again, he must not leave it alive!"</p>
               <p>"I agree with you perfectly!" said Desmondo. "And now for another disguise to meet
                  my young lady-love in. This rig is not only rather rough and ungainly, but it is
                  the one which her father has seen me in and will see me in again. Therefore for
                  fear of mishaps, should he be on the watch, I will try another. I think I can make
                  up as a military officer pretty well, and there are so many shoulder-straps in the
                  city that I think my chance all the better by it!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and it is an easy make-up. Will you alter your rig here?"</p>
               <p>"No, my friend Sheeney has accomodations where I can change quickly and well. I
                  will go there at the proper hour for a change, and, if necessary, return here in
                  my present dress. But if I find her as ready for matrimony as I hope, I shall not
                  wait for any change in my rig to fulfil her wishes and my own desires."</p>
               <p>"Of course not. If she is as willing as you hope, who will tie the knot? It must
                  be <emph>legal</emph>, you know, where property is at stake."</p>
               <p>"I have looked out for that, and have a pious friend ready who wants a job of the
                  kind. There will be no hesitation on his part, for fees are too scarce with him to
                  make him particular where they come from."</p>
               <p>"All right! count on my aid in every position where I can help you. If a little
                  force has to be added to persuasion, you will need help as well as counsel!"</p>
               <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6970-00000018"/>
               <p>"That is true. And now I propose that we indulge slightually in some potent
                  beverage, just to keep up our Californian character, and then go out and make some
                  preparations for trapping Stanley!"</p>
               <p>"I am agreed to both propositions—the first because I am as thirsty as a
                  Coney-Islander in dog-days; secondly, because our own safety depends upon our
                  crushing the traitor early, before he has gone too far with his exposures."</p>
               <p>Then let us go down and enter our plea at the bar; we are hardly exquisite enough
                  just now to order all drinks to our room, and we may as well rough it with the
                  Plebians while we are Plebians in a sense!"</p>
               <p>The President of the "N. O. C" smiled his consent and the two left the room in
                  company.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
               <p>STANLEY had invested largely out of the magnificent gift received from Mr. Van
                  Linden at the office of Mr. Jewsendbury, whither he had been followed by the keen,
                  revengeful eye of the disguised Desmondo. He had purchased three full packages of
                  lottery tickets, under the belief that out of so large a number, he must certainly
                  fall heir to one or more of the big prizes. For much accustomed as he was to the
                  "ways and means" of Lottery and Policy men, he had a vain idea in his head that
                  they sometimes allow a number outside of their own profession to draw a capital
                  prize. Even dishonorable as he was in the selfish betrayal of members of his own
                  clan, he had an idea that there really was honor among one class of thieves, and
                  that he could in his own case, at least, be fortune-favored therein. For, like
                  most traitorous villains, such as his namesake of Revolutionary days, or the
                  Iscariot of even earlier days, or the Floyd of still later ones, he was anxious
                  for pecuniary gain, no matter how it came.</p>
               <p>Therefore, purchasing from Lotteries which he knew would he drawn in a few hours,
                  he spent those few hours in the feverish delight of mentally counting chickens
                  about to be hatched in his golden nest. He even forgot his cautiousness in his
                  eagerness of dreaming, and went at the hour of four among the crowd of eager
                  dreamers to see what amount fortune had decided to enrich him with.</p>
               <p>The small office of the Lottery dealer was hardly half large enough to contain the
                  crowd who wished to see the numbers drawn; but he was very accomodating, and soon
                  had the "lucky numbers" checked off on circulars to be scattered among the crowd,
                  or so posted that all could see them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Stanley looked over his three packages in vain for a lucky number. And so did
                  other purchasers. And many and loud were the curses which poor, blind, old fortune
                  received on that eventful afternoon from her disappointed votaries. His
                  lamentations were full as loud as any heard at the time, but they were unnoticed
                  in the common grief except by one person, whose slouched hat and rough clothes did
                  not betoken him as a fortune-favored individual.</p>
               <p>A low, sneering laugh from this person fell upon the sensitive ears of Mr. Stanley
                  as he was swearing about his bad luck. He looked up and got one glance at a pair
                  of glittering black eyes, gleaming upon him with a kind of savage exultation, and
                  he thought in an instant that he recognised in that <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >outre</foreign> rig one whom he knew to be his bitterest foe.</p>
               <p>But while he stood for a moment in uncertainty, the slouched hat and the
                  California dress and form disappeared, pressing out of the excited throng which
                  environed him; and though he strove to follow it up, that form was nowhere to be
                  seen when he reached the street.</p>
               <p>"Desmondo in a new disguise and watching me—laughing too at my bad luck!" he
                  muttered as he looked up and down the street. "I knew that he had not left the
                  country. He is up to some new dodge, and my safety will be the least of his
                  studies. I must see Mr. Van Linden and tell him of my discovery!" And scarcely
                  thinking that it was already past office hours with the millionaire, he hurried
                  down Wall street to see him. He arrived just in time to be too late for an
                  interview with Mr. Van Linden; for the latter gentleman, well satisfied with a
                  very profitable day's work, had gone home.</p>
               <p>Vexed doubly at his unfortunate speculation and this disappointment, Stanley
                  bethought him of taking an omnibus-ride up town and calling at the residence of
                  his new found friend and patron, and hailed one which was, for a wonder, so full
                  that its driver would not stop, but passed on upon the route with a speed which
                  annoyed him exceedingly; for he was sure that in it he saw the identical hat which
                  had annoyed him at the broker's office, or rather the serpent-like gleam of
                  hate-fired eyes beneath such a hat.</p>
               <p>"There is something in this—something more dangerous to me than mere bad luck!" he
                  muttered, as he gazed after the stage. "Desmondo is in that disguise. I know the
                  flash of his fierce black eye too well not to recognise it. He is going up town
                  too. I must see Mr. Van Linden, and that speedily, to put him on his guard. If
                  Desmondo should visit him in such a disguise as that, he would not only be
                  unknown, but would work perhaps favorably to himself upon the old gentleman's
                  mind. These rich men are not very cautious in their reception of men who claim to
                  have come from California!"</p>
               <p>These thoughts were revolving in his mind when another stage of the line came
                  along, with room for yet one inside—standing room, I mean, for every seat had been
                  filled already.</p>
               <p>Into this stage got Mr. Stanley and there we will leave him for the present.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
               <p>THAT Desmondo meant mischief might have been seen from the fierce light of his
                  malicious eyes as they rested upon the traitor who had been the cause of the
                  disarrangement of plans hitherto succeeding so well.</p>
               <p>What shape that mischief would first exhibit was hardly known to himself. He knew
                  that if Stanley, who evidently had recognised him in spite of his disguise, was to
                  describe him to Mr. Van Linden, that the latter would re-examine the forged
                  letters of Wells, Fargo &amp; Co., and by consultation with the members of the
                  firm in the city, discover that they were forgeries in truth, and thus put an end
                  to all movements under his new name.</p>
               <p>His plan was quickly formed. It was to lure Mr. Van Linden out of the way at once,
                  so that Stanley could not see him, and thus gain time for other plans. To do this
                  he had hurried down to the Wall street office, while Stanley was yet in the crowd
                  at the Lottery broker's place.</p>
               <p>But he discovered, even sooner than the other, that Mr. Van Linden had gone home,
                  and he hurried after him in hopes of seeing him there and getting him out before
                  Stanley could see him. That done, he could, with the aid of his gang, soon take
                  care of the arch-enemy whose power of cunning he had already felt.</p>
               <p>Therefore he sprang into the full stage which we have already spoken of and had
                  the satisfaction of again seeing and recognizing Stanley as he passed him on his
                  way up town.</p>
               <p>Fortunately for him, the stage was<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6970-00000019"/> filled
                  with up-town goers and did not make a stop until he reached a hack-stand where a
                  fast pair of horses, driven by a coachman belonging to the Club, were standing
                  ready for a call.</p>
               <p>To leave the omnibus, spring to the hack and give hurried orders to the driver was
                  but the work of a few seconds and in less than a minute he was dashing up Broadway
                  at a rate which would have astonished "a fast man," much more the slow-coached old
                  gentleman whom he was following up.</p>
               <p>Before he reached Union Square he had the satisfaction of recognizing the carriage
                  of the millionaire proceeding at a slow rate; and when he had got sufficiently
                  beyond it to leave his own without danger of being seen, he pulled the
                  check-string and stopped its swift career.</p>
               <p>He then descended, and, turning, walked down the street, intending to nail Mr. Van
                  Linden as he came up, riding, as he knew he always did, with she carriage-top
                  thrown back, so he could see all and be seen by all whom he passed.</p>
               <p>He soon met the carriage, and with the same rough manner which had characterized
                  him in his first interview in Californian character, hailed Mr. Van Linden, and
                  asked him to hold on a moment.</p>
               <p>The old gentleman recognized his well-introduced friend of the morning and ordered
                  his coachman to stop.</p>
               <p>In the meantime it will be seen that Stanley was a trifle too late to see Mr. Van
                  Linden; so, with an oath he determined to wait until the morning.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
               <p>EL Senor Desmondo, with all his self-reliance and trust in his own powers, lost
                  sight of the fact that others might possess the same smartness that he
                  assumed.</p>
               <p>That is the great failing with all villains; they forget that there are others of
                  temperaments like their own.</p>
               <p>Such an one, though entirely unknown to the treacherous Stanley, had been
                  following Senor Desmondo and closely watching and weighing his every act.</p>
               <p>When Desmondo entered the "Orphean Lunch," he did not observe that a tall,
                  beautifully-formed, and well-dressed young man had, for some time been following
                  him.</p>
               <p>The young man entered the next box and, calling for a "toby," seemed to listen
                  eagerly to the conversation going on between the President and his Vice of the N.
                  O. C.</p>
               <p>As Number Four was occupied by these intriguers, the follower, fortunately for his
                  design, had located himself in Number Two; I say fortunately, because Stanley and
                  she whom he had called "Cal," occupied Number Six, as my reader will remember.</p>
               <p>The follower had the sense to gently put ajar the small window that opened into
                  Number Four, and, of course, heard the whole conversation between the two worthies
                  of the N. O. C.</p>
               <p>Upon this, the reader, by referring to a former chapter, will see that the
                  follower became acquainted with the whole design of the confederates, as did
                  Stanley and "Cal."</p>
               <p>From time to time this party would mutter, "Oh!" "Ah!" "A pretty put-up!" "Will
                  you, indeed? We'll see!" and expressions of the like tenor. He had overheard all
                  the proposed doings of the two officials of the N. O. C.</p>
               <p>At last these worthies, lighting their segars, left Number Four.</p>
               <p>No sooner were they well out than the party from Number Two stepped into Number
                  Four.</p>
               <p>He heard in Number Six a loud voice.</p>
               <p>Surprised, he beheld in the partition between Number Four and Number Six, an
                  aperture of some three or four inches square—the one that Stanley had opened to
                  enable himself and Cal to overhear the conversation between the heads of the N. O.
                  C.</p>
               <p>So, even Stanley, in his turn, had so far lost himself as to forget that there are
                  two sides to a partition, and that a hole straight through it can be made
                  available by more than one party.</p>
               <p>Stanley had noted the departure of the President and Vice-President of the N. O.
                  C.</p>
               <p>And now, the young man whom I have designated "follower," overheard the following
                  remarks made by Benedict Arnold Stanley:</p>
               <p>"So they distrust me and have the temerity to plan my death to get me out of their
                  way. I think I'll buy the diamonds which Senor Desmondo wishes to exhibit to me,
                  but I will borrow his heart's blood to pay for them with! Yes—Senor Desmondo, you
                  shall learn that Benedict Arnold Stanley is your master. Come, Cal, my love, we
                  have nothing further to remain for, and I have a busy night before me. Senor
                  Desmondo may find that he cannot marry an heiress as easily as he supposes! I will
                  put a flea in the ear of the old gentleman whose fair favor he thinks he has
                  gained!"</p>
               <p>Then the speaker and his lady friend left.</p>
               <p>The follower smiled—a sickly smile it was, because it betokened hate.</p>
               <p>"They ruined the only one that ever loved me," he murmured. "This is a
                  three-handed duel, and mine shall be the victorious arm."</p>
               <p>He turned and left the box, and, calling-for a segar outside and paying his bill,
                  he left the "Orphean Lunch," smoking violently as he went up the street.</p>
               <p>But the "toby" he had not even tasted of.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
               <p>ON the next morning, Benedict Arnold Stanley was making a call upon a young lady
                  in Bleecker street.</p>
               <p>The fellow never chose to assume the character of a gentleman—he never could
                  sustain it; so, on this occasion he sat in the parlor of No.—, with his legs
                  dangling over the arm of the rocking chair which he was violently moving.</p>
               <p>Before him was seated a young lady of fine and regular features, whose conduct was
                  that of a party interested—whether for love or hate, I know not—in the wretch
                  before her. As she forms no feature of my story, it is not necessary for me to
                  speak further of her.</p>
               <p>A note was handed to Stanley, who had the habit of giving his address at some
                  house where he had a fair-acquaintance, but never where he should have been for
                  the benefit of others—at his home.</p>
               <p>Benedict Arnold Stanley was not the man to make any display of sensation, and his
                  whiskers were always in the same position and his moustache never "went up under
                  his nose" nor did his nose "come down over his chin."</p>
               <p>But on this occasion—whether it was because he held the girl present in no
                  estimation of account, he absolutely whistled.</p>
               <p>It is very rarely that a dishonest man indulges in whistling; always guarded in
                  his action, a whistle sounds too frank for him.</p>
               <p>The note read as follows:</p>
               <p>"If Benedict Arnold Stanley, than whom a greater rogue does not exist, will walk
                  upon Elizabeth street between Houston and Bleecker, this day at 11 A. M., a lady
                  would be pleased to see him."</p>
               <p>He drew forth his watch.</p>
               <p>"Hem! Just in time. It's daylight, and I fear no evil; ahem!"</p>
               <p>And, kissing the girl in a very careless way, he left number—Bleecker street and
                  sauntered into Elizabeth street, leisurely up the right-hand-side.</p>
               <p>He had walked the length of a block twice when he began to imagine that<pb
                     n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6970-00000020"/> he might have been trifled with and his
                  dignity trespassed upon.</p>
               <p>"D—!" he muttered, as he again turned from the corner of Houston street "I—"</p>
               <p>But he ceased.</p>
               <p>A woman who was coming from Bleecker street, as it appeared, paused in her walk,
                  as though she would speak to him.</p>
               <p>She was showily, yet neatly dressed, tall and of fine supple figure and wore over
                  her hat a thick, light-blue veil.</p>
               <p>These veils are the deuce; they cover an enormous quantity of sins. Take my word
                  for it, when a woman decks herself with a light-blue veil, she is a loving one,
                  and likes life and fun.</p>
               <p>My reader will judge for himself of the qualifications of this woman.</p>
               <p>"Ah, my dear," said Stanley, "you wish to see me?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>He did not recognize the voice.</p>
               <p>"You received my note, did you not?"</p>
               <p>"Just now, and I—"</p>
               <p>He would have grasped her hand, but she avoided his intention, saying
                  hurriedly:</p>
               <p>"Not here, not in the street. Can't we find some place—some retired spot where, we
                  can converse freely in private?"</p>
               <p>And she gazed around her.</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes! certainly, my dear!" remarked B. A. S. "This way!"</p>
               <p>And they walked up the street.</p>
               <p>At the front door of a building on the signs of which was painted that which
                  denoted that a certain perfumery was manufactured, or at least dealt in there, he
                  stopped.</p>
               <p>"It is very retired here, and a very comfortably arranged establishment
                  altogether, and so very accommodating," remarked Stanley.</p>
               <p>He palled the bell.</p>
               <p>One of the green blinds was partially opened and somebody peeped out, and she
                  seeming to recognize him, the door was soon opened, and the party opening it then
                  disappeared into the front room.</p>
               <p>The woman who had accompanied Stanley said nothing, but quietly followed him up
                  stairs into the back room on the second floor. This was gorgeously furnished with
                  everything that could conduce to one's comfort.</p>
               <p>While he laid his hat upon the table she seated herself composedly upon the damask
                  lounge.</p>
               <p>Then he sat down by her.</p>
               <p>"Now my dear remove that veil and let me see who you are," and he made a motion as
                  if to aid her in the operation.</p>
               <p>"Stop, Mr. Benedict Arnold Stanley! I know you well. Although fully aware of the
                  bad reputation that you have, that even your indulgences are characterized by
                  depravity, I have met you for a purpose of my own, not your sensual
                  gratification."</p>
               <p>Stanley made an impatient motion.</p>
               <p>"I am not at all afraid of you, though I believe you capable of any cowardly act;
                  moreover, I shall not remove my veil."</p>
               <p>"D—!" roared Stanley; "what did you lure me in here for?"</p>
               <p>To avoid being watched, as I know that spies dog <emph>your</emph> footsteps—watch
                  your every action."</p>
               <p>"Ha! you know, then—"</p>
               <p>"I know exactly what labors most upon your mind at the present time, and what,
                  bully it out as you may, you really fear in your heart."</p>
               <p>He laughed scornfully.</p>
               <p>"Well, never mind that, I do a little in the way of spying myself, and through my
                  agents."</p>
               <p>"You? What the devil have you to do in the case?"</p>
               <p>"That is my affair. I overheard not only the whole of the interview between your
                  two friends in Number Four at the Orphean Lunch, but also the principal pal
                  portion of the one between you and the individual you call Cal."</p>
               <p>Stanley stopped pacing and faced her.</p>
               <p>"Well, what of it?"</p>
               <p>"Simply this: You're bothered, and I can help you."</p>
               <p>"How so?"</p>
               <p>"I can help you, upon one condition."</p>
               <p>"And that is—"</p>
               <p>"You make a brag that anything can be done with you by kindness, but nothing by
                  force. My incentive will be to do you a service upon your promise to aid me when I
                  call upon you to do the same for me. Though I don't place much confidence in your
                  promises (who does?) I will receive one from you, as I know your own interest will
                  compel you to its fulfilment."</p>
               <p>"Compel?"</p>
               <p>"Bah! Don't put on airs with me. I'm not a <emph>child,</emph> nor
                     <emph>fair</emph> and frail."</p>
               <p>Stanley seated himself, now being very cool and collected.</p>
               <p>"Well; go on!"</p>
               <p>"You promise?"</p>
               <p>"I do—but I must know you!"</p>
               <p>"That you cannot do—I am not fish for <emph>your</emph> net. Listen. Last night
                  Desmondo started, to find his proposed victim, Van Linden, in a stage just ahead
                  of you. At Union Square, he entered a coach, which, being furiously driven, passed
                  the private establishment of Mr. Van Linden. The 'Senor' alighted, and, walking
                  back, in his disguise encountered the millionaire, who invited him to ride. There
                  he beat you, for he was the first to abuse and disabuse the mind of his host,
                  while you failed to see the latter."</p>
               <p>"How do you know?" enquired Stanley, angrily.</p>
               <p>"I know everything. I know all about yourself and your various connections, all
                  about the club, and many other matters supposed by parties interested to be locked
                  up in their own breasts."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, you must know what passed between the millionaire and my enemy."</p>
               <p>"I do. A young man played 'cut-be-hind' on the vehicle and I am in possession of
                  the whole conversation."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! You're a good worker. Where a woman such as I take you to be, puts a hand
                  to the matter it's—queer if mischief don't follow!"</p>
               <p>"You're right! Mischief is my aim. But I wish to finish this interview. In order
                  to make it as short as possible, I have written down here all that it is necessary
                  you should know, with some instructions, following which you will benefit yourself
                  now, and me at some future time."</p>
               <p>Stanley looked at the MSS.</p>
               <p>"I do not recognize the handwriting," he remarked.</p>
               <p>"Of course not. Do you take me for a fool? Trust me, I am master of this position,
                  for <emph>I have committed no crime</emph>. And now I must go. You will remain
                  here for five minutes, so that, should any one be on your track—which I think more
                  than likely—they will not trace me with you. I shall see you again!"</p>
               <p>And the woman in the light-blue veil left the apartment and the house.</p>
               <p>"Remain here five minutes?" said Stanley, grasping his hat as soon as he heard the
                  front door close. "Not so fast, my lady! I'll be curst if I must not ascertain who
                  you are and where you go to!"</p>
               <p>On reaching the front door, the green blind opened partially and a voice said:
                  "Good-bye, Mr. Stanley!"</p>
               <p>He mentally swore at the impertinence of the party within, and looked up and down
                  the street in search of the woman with the light-blue veil.</p>
               <p>He saw a coach driving rapidly down town, while from the window of it floated a
                  light-blue veil.</p>
               <p>He also saw the driver turn his head and grin at him furiously.</p>
               <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6970-00000021"/>
               <p>"D—n!" he muttered, as he strolled away; "Foiled again!"</p>
               <p>Who was this mysterious woman in the light-blue veil, that seemed to know all the
                  passions and intentions of the various personages of our story?</p>
               <p>We shall see.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
               <p>It was on the same afternoon that Mr. Linden Van Linden returned from his
                  counting-room rather earlier than usual.</p>
               <p>He was accompanied by Mr. Youngson, still in his <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >outre</foreign> California dress; he had told Mr. Van Linden that he could not
                  appear in proper trim until his Broadway tailor had finished, and delivered at his
                  hotel, the fine suit of clothes that he had made to order.</p>
               <p>"Never mind," said Mr. Linden Van Linden, "I know your <emph>worth</emph>, and
                  shall be very happy to have you as a guest even in your present appearance."</p>
               <p>Mr. Youngson had thanked him, and this morning was accompanying him to his
                  residence.</p>
               <p>On the previous evening, the millionaire had called his daughter to an interview
                  with him, after his ride with Desmondo.</p>
               <p>"My dear Magdalena," said he, "I have had come to me, well recommended by parties
                  in high standing, a Californian, a Mr. Youngson. He is coming to pay us a visit
                  with me to-morrow, and will probably apologize for his uncouth appearance."</p>
               <p>"Ah, father! What kind of a man is he?" enquired the fair girl.</p>
               <p>"Well, fine, young and handsome. But he'll apologize probably to you for his
                  appearance, as he has not been in town long enough to have the clothes that he has
                  ordered delivered to him," replied her father.</p>
               <p>"I suppose," he added, "you have forgotten that rascally music teacher, as I bade
                  you to?"</p>
               <p>"No, father, I cannot forget him;" returned the truthful girl.</p>
               <p>"Have you seen him since?"</p>
               <p>"I have not <emph>seen</emph> him, father."</p>
               <p>She felt that she was telling truth, but not the whole truth, when she did not
                  mention the intercourse that had taken place between her and the man she was
                  determined to love so well.</p>
               <p>"Ah! That's good, anyway. You will soon forget the fellow. I guess this Youngson
                  will pretty effectually drive him out of your head."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, father!"</p>
               <p>"Why not? He is young, I <emph>think</emph> accomplished, and I <emph>know</emph>
                  he is very wealthy. Wait till you see him dressed as he should and will be."</p>
               <p>Magdalena shook her head.</p>
               <p>"Well," said her father, very amiably. "We will see at all events; you will
                  receive him cordially?"</p>
               <p>"As I would any of my dear father' friends," said Magdalena, imprinting a kiss
                  upon his brow.</p>
               <p>Would that be the last she would ever give him?</p>
               <p>And now, Mr. Youngson and Mr. Van Linden, as agreed upon, entered the splendid
                  residence of the latter, and the former was by him properly introduced to his
                  daughter.</p>
               <p>"Pleased to see you, sir," remarked Magdalena, cooly.</p>
               <p>Then something startled her; that shape—</p>
               <p>"Excuse me a moment, Mr. Youngson," said Van Linden; "I will return instantly,"
                  and he left the apartment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Youngson, with an easy grace of manner, sauntered to the centre-table and
                  picked up a book from it, and, while apparently engaged in examining it, furtively
                  searched the troubled countenance of Magdalena.</p>
               <p>It was a troubled countenance, for the fair being was convinced that Mr. Youngson
                  was <emph>not</emph> Mr. Youngson.</p>
               <p>She was about to walk to him and receive his homage, when she heard steps
                  approaching the parlor.</p>
               <p>"My father is coming," she remarked.</p>
               <p>Then from her manner, the returned Californian was convinced that she had
                  penetrated his disguise.</p>
               <p>But he still remained occupied with the examination of the book when Mr. Linden
                  Van Linden entered with a troubled face.</p>
               <p>The Californian noted it from under his shaggy eyebrows, but remained passive.</p>
               <p>"Ah!" exclaimed the millionaire; "examining our library? I trust that the books,
                  with the aid of my daughter's company, will serve to answer you for awhile, as I
                  have just received a note that requires my immediate presence at the office. I
                  shall find you here on my return, of course?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>I think so!</emph>" said Mr. Youngson.</p>
               <p>"All right! I'll return as soon as possible. Adieu!" And the millionaire left the
                  house.</p>
               <p>And then Mr. Youngson approached the fair Magdalena, and, drawing a chair close to
                  hers, said:</p>
               <p>"You will forgive me? For so determined to see you was I, that I was compelled to
                  assume this disguise to gain your presence. Would to Heaven I could ever be thus
                  near you!"</p>
               <p>"Forgive you?" exclaimed the ingenuous girl. "Ah, indeed I do! Be patient, dear
                  friend, and we will find that time will eradicate the impression made by your
                  enemies upon my dear father, who only, in reality, desires to look out for my
                  welfare."</p>
               <p>"Patient! How can I?" enquired Desmondo.</p>
               <p>"Ah!" said Magdalena; "do you not still love me, Senor?"</p>
               <p>"As my life!" was the enthusiastic reply. "Life did I say? What would life be
                  without you, the one dear object of my life? You, you alone, are my
                  existence."</p>
               <p>Thus we will leave the confiding heroine of our story in loving converse with her
                  deluding, fiend-like lover, and turn to another part of our story.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXV.</head>
               <p>JUST as Mr. Van Linden entered his residence in company with Mr. Youngson a coach
                  drove into Elizabeth street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Benedict Arnold Stanley, with two rough-looking men, was standing upon the
                  sidewalk, evidently awaiting the arrival.</p>
               <p>Approaching the driver, and observing that the coach was empty, Stanley addressed
                  him, offering him a greenback if he would tell him where he came from.</p>
               <p>"Fork over!" said the coachee, extending his hand for the bill; having received it
                  and put it in his pocket, he answered: "From Seventeenth street."</p>
               <p>"What part of it?"</p>
               <p>The Jehu refused to answer.</p>
               <p>Stanley looked at him fiercely; the man was a very stout Irishman. It would not do
                  to be savage with him; so Stanley, with a muttered curse, pulled forth another
                  greenback, and said:</p>
               <p>"Will you take this and answer me one other question?"</p>
               <p>"I will."</p>
               <p>He clutched the second bill and Stanley asked: "Where are we going to?"</p>
               <p>"Where the mistress tells me, and there she is."</p>
               <p>"D— you!" said Stanley, while his two companions laughed. He turned and saw close
                  at hand the lady with the light-blue veil.</p>
               <p>She motioned to Stanley to enter the vehicle after her, which he did.</p>
               <p>One of the two men followed, while the other mounted on the platform at the
                  rear.</p>
               <p>At the corner of Bleecker street, the carriage stopped and another man took his
                  station by the side of the driver.</p>
               <p>"You have followed my directions so far, I see;" remarked the lady in the
                  light-blue veil. "Have you attended to my other instructions?"</p>
               <p>"Perfectly, madam!"</p>
               <p>"And the party who is to bear the<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6970-00000022"/>
                  principal part in this melo-drama—can we depend upon him?"</p>
               <p>"All is complete, madam."</p>
               <p>"I am happy to hear it. It <emph>may</emph> prevent a great wrong being committed.
                  You must not think that I am preaching morals to you; you would be the last
                  subject upon whom I should choose to waste <emph>my</emph> morals. Don't laugh;
                     <emph>I am in earnest</emph>."</p>
               <p>"I believe you; and from the benefit you have promised to confer upon me—no matter
                  what my reputation may be, I wish you to believe me."</p>
               <p>"I do!"</p>
               <p>Here the coach turned into Fifth avenue. After proceeding some distance, the
                  coachman halted and awaited further orders, which were given to him by the man at
                  his side, who had joined the party in Bleecker street.</p>
               <p>After some delay, at length the order was given and away they started.</p>
               <p>"Now," said the man on the box to the coachman, "you will follow up at about this
                  distance that carriage that has just driven off."</p>
               <p>"All right, sir!"</p>
               <p>The note that Mr. Van Linden had received was from his clerk and read as
                  follows:</p>
               <p>"A gentleman is here who wishes me to send you word that he believes he can avert
                  a great danger that hangs over your head—perhaps save you from ruin. He begs that
                  you will hasten."</p>
               <p>So the millionaire proceeded with speed to his counting-room.</p>
               <p>On arriving there he found no person present but the clerk.</p>
               <p>"Where is the party you wrote me about?" he enquired.</p>
               <p>"He has left, sir," replied the clerk. "He said twas impossible to wait longer for
                  you, as he had an imperative engagement. He left this note for you to be delivered
                  to you the moment you arrived."</p>
               <p>He opened the note and read:</p>

                              As speedily as possible, hasten to your home. I trust you will be in
                              time, but I fear not; for Desmondo has sworn to marry your daughter
                              this very morning, and she consented. If you doubt my word, examine

               <p>The millionaire rushed to his safe, and, bringing forth the papers that had served
                  as vouchers for Mr. Youngson, he compared them with others. "A forgery indeed!" He
                  was soon at home, where he found a note from his daughter stating that she had
                  "fled with the Spanish exile and should soon, as his wife, return to claim her
                  father's forgiveness."</p>
               <p>"Forgiveness—never! All that I have struggled for was she—everything for her. And
                  now, disobedient and reckless as she is, I cast her forth forever. What are riches
                  and the world to me when people will point at me and say: 'there goes the father
                  of MAGDALENA, THE OUTCAST!"</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head>
               <p>I left the Senor Desmondo and his fair and ingenuous victim, Magdalena, engaged in
                  a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tete-a-tete</foreign>.</p>
               <p>"Do you not yet love me, <foreign xml:lang="SPA">Senor</foreign>?" she had
                  said.</p>
               <p>"What is life to me?" he had replied. "You, you, fair lady, alone, are the sole
                  sum and substance of my life,—my existence itself."</p>
               <p>This was very pleasant language in the ears of the confiding girl.</p>
               <p>"Persecuted as I am—banished from my land; hounded as I have been from spot to
                  spot, I have sought this country, 'the home of the oppressed,' only to find myself
                  in chains, from which, from their soft binding influence, I am as unable as I am
                  desirous not to escape."</p>
               <p>"Ah, Senor!" exclaimed Magdalena, delightedly.</p>
               <p>"Mine is no common fate, dear lady," continued the disguised Desmondo. "Must I
                  repeat to you that life has no charms for me when separated from your lovely self?
                  But when the politics of my dear country shall have assumed a phase that will
                  replace me in my former position with, if possible, additional grandeur and
                  honors, then—then, dear Magdalena, shall you shine as the brightest star in the
                  Court of Spain if—if—" and he hesitated.</p>
               <p>"If what, Senor?"</p>
               <p>"If I can only bind you, as my own wife, so irrevocably to me that all my anxiety
                  shall be soothed, and happy in the possession of your dear self, I can then with
                  the great encouragement that my happiness will afford me, labor for the
                  accomplishment of my, redemption from this cruel exile and your exaltation."</p>
               <p>"I understand you, Senor. But how is all this to be accomplished?"</p>
               <p>"By your consenting to marry me immediately. Will you do so?"</p>
               <p>She turned her head aside.</p>
               <p>Conflicting thoughts passed through her brain.</p>
               <p>"I <emph>do</emph> love him," she ruminated; "I would do anything to relieve him
                  from his present anxious position. Shall I accede to his proposition? But, then—my
                  father, my dear father—who has toiled so long only for <emph>my</emph> comfort and
                  prosperity—shall I forsake him?—must I?"</p>
               <p>"Well, dear lady?" said Desmondo, as he sauntered to the centre-table again.</p>
               <p>Magdalena glanced at him.</p>
               <p>His head was bent over a book which he held in his hand, as though he were in
                  anguish.</p>
               <p>She thought she observed tears <unclear>falling</unclear> upon the volume.</p>
               <p>A fearful struggle took possession of her heart.</p>
               <p>This man—this nobleman, exiled from his native land, quietly suffering, bravely
                  enduring—this man, so noble, so refined, so devoted to her—by one step—however
                  questionable—she could relieve his anxiety, quiet his mind and enable him to
                  pursue his course towards the accomplishment of his political redemption—a relief
                  which he had declared she alone <emph>could</emph> afford.</p>
               <p>She started toward him.</p>
               <p>"Desmondo! <emph>Dear</emph> Desmondo!"</p>
               <p>He turned toward her an excited countenance and, the better to carry out his part,
                  made a show of utter despair, and murmured:</p>
               <p>"Well, what is it, dear lady?"</p>
               <p>"I am yours—yours forever!"</p>
               <p>Her countenance lighted up with a radiance that seemed almost angelic as she
                  continued:</p>
               <p>"Senor, I am so dear to you—as I must believe that love is all-desirous in your
                  heart as in mine—I—I will be yours!"</p>
               <p>She flung herself upon his breast.</p>
               <p>And then this accomplished villain—while in all her confidence and trust, she was
                  fondly willing to submit to his caresses—this villain, in order to obtain the
                  deeper hold upon her loving, gushing heart, which had now lost all inclination to
                  doubt, remarked, with a coolness, that seemed to his victim only agitation of mind
                  and a temptation to self-denial:</p>
               <p>"Be cautious, dear Magdalena—for I will now thus term you; think it all over, so
                  that in the future you will never regret the step that you now take."</p>
               <p>"Now, Desmondo?" and she raised her beautiful, mellow eyes to his.</p>
               <p>"Dearest, <emph>now</emph>!" and he printed a kiss upon her burning lips. "All is
                     in<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6970-00000023"/> waiting: the carriage, the
                  minister—all is ready!"</p>
               <p>"But—but—Desmondo—my father?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, dearest! He will never consent to our union. He is rich—I, at present, am
                  poor. I am a stranger, and have no friends here. My enemies are powerful enough to
                  prejudice him against me. The present is our last opportunity; for, as I am
                  watched closely by them, though never able to confront them—or, at least, they
                  will not confront me," the Senor's eyes flashed momentarily—"no doubt that even
                  now they are seeking to poison his mind against me, Magdalena!"</p>
               <p>His voice assumed a tone of exquisite affection and tenderness.</p>
               <p>"Senor?"</p>
               <p>The beautiful eyes, suffused with tears of passion, beamed upon him.</p>
               <p>Had he been less of the villain than he was, that glance of deep, pure and,
                  surely, abiding love would have overcome him.</p>
               <p>But it did not; and he continued.</p>
               <p>"Did you not promise to marry with me?"</p>
               <p>She lowered her eyes and murmured faintly:</p>
               <p>"I did!"</p>
               <p>"And you will?"</p>
               <p>"I will!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Now?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Now!"</p>
               <p>With an apparent impulse of exquisite and incontrollable emotion, he clasped her
                  to his heart.</p>
               <p>Could Heaven witness such perfidy and not cloud the sun?</p>
               <p>"One favor, Senor," she supplicated, plaintively. "I trust my love—myself—all, to
                  you. My poor father!—before I go I must leave a note for him."</p>
               <p>He made a gesture of impatience.</p>
               <p>"Surely, you would not have me eave him utterly heart-broken?"</p>
               <p>Desmondo recovered himself.</p>
               <p>"Oh, ne!" he replied, with well-feigned ingenuousness. "Pardon me dearest; but
                  love is blind, you know'—and he assumed a playful manner "Go, and write; comfort
                  him to the best of your ability, for I know that time will teach him that, in
                  following the gushing impulses of your heart, you have done no wrong. Go!"</p>
               <p>With a fond embrace, they parted for the moment.</p>
               <p>Magdalena ascended to her chamber, and wrote the following:</p>

               <p>In the meantime, Senor Desmonde had approached the window, and throwing the sash
                  up, made a signal without.</p>
               <p>A carriage, that had been standing some three doors below drove up in front of the
                  house.</p>
               <p>Desmondo was about to close the window, when a man passed on the opposite side of
                  the street.</p>
               <p>He glanced at him and met a haughty look in return.</p>
               <p>The Senor slammed the window.</p>
               <p>"D—!" he muttered. "What is <emph>he</emph> doing here at this time?"</p>
               <p>The man on the opposite side of the tree t walked leizurely to the corner and then
                  returned and entered a carriage that stood some distance below.</p>
               <p>Desmondo had recognized Stanley; but, intent upon his present purpose, had omitted
                  to note his progress.</p>
               <p>In some ten minutes, Magdalena descended, having left her note to her father on
                  the table, and without a word gave the Senor her hand.</p>
               <p>He led her forth gently and with careful guidance, and they entered the carriage
                  together.</p>
               <p>The driver, after a brief conversation in private with Desmondo, mounted his box
                  and drove rapidly off.</p>
               <p>Neither he nor Desmondo, however, noticed that, as they started, another coach,
                  which had been stopping some distance below, pursued them.</p>

               <p>PARSON MIDDLEWITCH sat in his "study," poring over the leaves of a commentary on
                  the Romans' wars.</p>
               <p>From the peculiar tint of his complexion, especially his nose, one would imagine
                  that a commentary upon the rum-'uns was more suited to his character.</p>
               <p>Parson Middlewitch was eminently philosophical. He had managed by dint of
                  perseverence and self-denial, after a few years of study (?) to attain a
                  "calling," and as the pastor of a church was now very happy, as a matter of
                  course, to receive any little favor that might be included in his proper
                  perquisites.</p>
               <p>Marriages and deaths are pleasant affairs truly to the pious Mr. Middlewitch, who
                  delights in short, red hair—excessively red hair—a brick <choice>
                     <sic>complexon</sic>
                     <corr>complexion</corr>
                  </choice> and a soft, soothing manner that seems to say to you:</p>
               <p>"Anything in my way? I assure you I am always happy to officiate at a marriage—or,
                  perhaps there is a death in the family? You are not in indigent circumstances, I
                  presume?" and while Mr. Middlewitch is seeming to say this to you when you call
                  upon him, he's rubbing his hands together violently.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Middlewitch, who married him for some reason that she could never
                  satisfactorily define (perhaps because no one else sought her precious self) was a
                  rather short woman, with one shoulder carried habitually higher than the other,
                  wore long ringlets of light-brown hair—that is to say, neither red nor yellow; but
                  a cross between them, which took her some two hours daily to put by the aid of
                  water into position; had an eye that it would puzzle one to define, a neither
                  green or gray, and in shape was like the letter H, with the sides drawn up closer
                  and the top space filled up. Her countenance was of a sallow cast and its
                  expression struck you as insinuating that she came into the world to create
                  mischief, and she was determined to lose no opportunity so to do. Her "tongue was
                  hung on a pivot,"—to use an old simile, and like the magnetic needle, always kept
                  to its objective point—scandal.</p>
               <p>Very strange stories had been circulated concerning the conduct of Mrs.
                  Middlewitch prior to her marriage—faint narratives about a sailor who always
                  managed to get rid of his money when in port, in a very short space of time; about
                  a captain of cavalry of whose peculiar manœverings to obtain money nothing was
                  understood; of an old friend whom she had led into much trouble and who, having
                  been a good guardian to her, received his reward by being continually disturbed by
                  her mischief-making.</p>
               <p>This delicious Mrs. Middlewitch wrote poetry for obscure and almost unknown
                  papers—principally advertising sheets—always patterning after Tom Hood—making her
                  titles the "Dirge of the Female Compositor," the "Chant of the Hat-trimmer," etc.
                  etc.</p>
               <p>"Paul," said she, as she interrupted Mr. Middlewitch in his study, "The party is
                  coming."</p>
               <p>"The party, my dear?" enquired the parson, with a smile of interesting
                  dullness.</p>
               <p>"Yes, <emph>the</emph> party you know, my dear."</p>
               <p>"Ah! Adelaide, my dear, you will provide some cake—get the cheapest rom the
                  baker's—and a—well, say half-a-decanter of carroway-cordial. Mind that the
                  table-cloth is clean; that will make up for the scant fare," remarked Mr.
                  Middlewitch suavely.</p>
               <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6970-00000024"/>
               <p>There came a knocking at the front door.</p>
               <p>Mr. Middlewitch cordially rubbed his hands together, and straightening his
                  neck-tie, assumed an increase of benevolent expression upon his countenance and
                  waited upon the callers.</p>
               <p>A carriage stood before the door.</p>
               <p>But down the street some distance was another one.</p>
               <p>The dubious-colored eyes of the parson lit upon the forms of a man roughly clad,
                  and mounted by heavy whiskers and a moustache, and a woman over whose hat was
                  thrown a black veil.</p>
               <p>Mr. Middlewitch rubbed his hands together, and silently motioned the parties to
                  enter.</p>
               <p>These were no other than the Senor Desmondo and the millionaire's daughter.</p>
               <p>With the usual fluttering of the heart that attends upon such momentous occasions,
                  Magdalena assumed a seat, while the Senor conversed in low tones with the
                  parson.</p>
               <p>Suddenly there was a loud noise and a hard swearing in front of the house</p>
               <p>The red hairs of Mr. Middlewitch rose on end.</p>
               <p>Magdalena trembled.</p>
               <p>The Senor opened the blinds and looked out.</p>
               <p>"Bah!" said he. "It is only our coachman quarrelling with some drunken
                  fellow."</p>
               <p>And he closed the window without waiting to observe that the drunken fellow"
                  overpowered the coachman, and compelling the latter to mount his box, drove away
                  very quietly from the door.</p>
               <p>And now Mrs. Middlewitch entered with the refreshments, which she placed upon the
                  table with an attempt at graceful movement that was almost absurd.</p>
               <p>The pastor smiled urbanely and rubbed his hands together as if he were already
                  gently fondling in them the expected fee</p>
               <p>"All is ready, I believe," he said to his partner. "You will be a witness?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Middlewitch bowed her head, and her ringlets (they were very damp and darker
                  than usual) waved gracefully, like golden pendulums.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile Desmondo had approached Magdalena.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Senor!" said she, with emotion, "Something tells me that I am doing wrong.
                  But I trust fully in you. I am right; am I not?"</p>
               <p>"You are, dearest; your confidence is not misplaced. This is not exactly the style
                  in which we <emph>should</emph> be married; but the time will come when—once
                  possessing you—I will be enabled to celebrate this event in a manner befitting our
                  rank and position."</p>
               <p>The tones of Desmondo were very enticing to the fair Magdalena.</p>
               <p>"We are ready, now, I believe?" questioned the urbane parson, rubbing his
                  hands.</p>
               <p>"Aye! All ready!" said Desmondo, "Come, dearest."</p>
               <p>Magdalena advanced tremblingly and assumed her position beside her future
                  partner-for-life.</p>
               <p>The door leading into the hall at this moment was slightly opened.</p>
               <p>The hall, as well as the room, had been richly carpeted by the parishioners of the
                  Rev. Mr. Middlewitch.</p>
               <p>Thus one could tread lightly without attracting attention.</p>
               <p>Desmondo and Magdalena advanced.</p>
               <p>The marriage ceremony had proceeded to that point where the minister enquired if
                  anybody had any obstacle to present to the marriage of these two <choice>
                     <sic>eprsons</sic>
                     <corr>persons</corr>
                  </choice>.</p>
               <p>He raised his eyes, which had been sanctimoniously cast upon the carpet and
                  saw—</p>
               <p>At the same moment, a clear, soft voice exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"I object!"</p>
               <p>It was a woman, with her countenance hidden by the light-blue vail which she wore,
                  that spoke.</p>
               <p>The red-hairs of Mr. Middlewitch assumed a perpendicular position, and he ceased
                  to rub his hands together, apparently at a loss where to place them.</p>
               <p>The woman in the light-blue veil advanced to the side of Magdalena, and taking the
                  hand of the latter, gave it a slight pressure, as of assurance and
                  encouragement.</p>
               <p>"I object!" she repeated, with dignity.</p>
               <p>Ah!" exclaimed the parson, and he glanced at his wife.</p>
               <p>"Oh!" exclaimed that person, clapping her hands and stooping forward in order to
                  set the hair pendulums in motion again.</p>
               <p>Magdalena clung to Desmondo.</p>
               <p>The latter looked at the woman with the light-blue vail.</p>
               <p>He did not recognize her.</p>
               <p>"You object?" said he, sarcastically. "I believe, Mr. Middlewitch, that on such an
                  occasion, the objecting parties are compelled, if they wish to have their protests
                  effectual, to announce their ground of <choice>
                     <sic>inteference</sic>
                     <corr>interference</corr>
                  </choice>."</p>
               <p>He bowed to the woman of the light blue veil with mock courtesy</p>
               <p>She returned the salute in the same manner.</p>
               <p>"Y—, yes!" observed the parson, while his hands after momentarily clasping each
                  other again separated.</p>
               <p>"Oh yes," said Mrs. M., with a light scream.</p>
               <p>"My ground of objection" said the voice that came from beneath the light-blue veil
                  "is that this child has been lured from her home by this person, unknown to her
                  poor father, and this person thus clandestinely seeks to marry her to a swindler,
                  gambler—in short <emph>a thief!</emph>"</p>
               <p>Desmonde sprang toward the speaker, with fury.</p>
               <p>But whatever might have been his intention, it was frustrated.</p>
               <p>Three men had quietly entered the room and the Senor was held back by the power of
                  one on each arm.</p>
               <p>He turned with an oath.</p>
               <p>Then Magdalena sprang from him and the woman in the light-blue veil led her to a
                  seat.</p>
               <p>Desmondo saw Stanley, standing quietly by him.</p>
               <p>"Dog! traitor!" he howled. "You here?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I am here," was the cool reply. "You plotted deeply for my death. It was a
                  well-put-up job; but, trust me, you will never accomplish your intention. All I
                  desire is to be let alone; for when I <emph>am</emph> aroused I am a man of
                  deeds!"</p>
               <p>He drew a revolver and pointed it at the breast of the Senor.</p>
               <p>Magdalena uttered a fearful shriek and fell on the floor.</p>
               <p>The arm of Stanley was seized and the pistol was wrenched from his grasp.</p>
               <p>"Cease this, sir!" said the woman in the light-blue veil. "Here is neither time
                  nor place to settle your private quarrels. You exceed your instructions!"</p>
               <p>Desmondo gazed upon her with a mingled feeling of surprise and admiration.</p>
               <p>"Who are you?" he demanded.</p>
               <p>"That you shall know in time, my good friend. In the meantime I shall remove from
                  your contact and influence this poor girl, who must be taught to conquer her
                  misplaced affection. Suffice it that you ruined the only man I ever loved—the only
                  man that ever truly loved me. For his sorrows and mine, you shall suffer a
                  hundred-fold. I am your deadly enemy, and a powerful one, <emph>for I have
                     committed no crime.</emph>"</p>
               <p>Mr. Middlewitch had sat down and was calculating the discount on his expected
                  fee.</p>
               <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6970-00000025"/>
               <p>Mrs. Middlewitch had, by means of cold water and smelling salts, brought Magdalena
                  to consciousness.</p>
               <p>"Come!" said the woman with the light-blue veil; and she led the now weeping girl
                  forth to the carriage, which immediately drove off with them.</p>
               <p>Then Stanley said to the two men:</p>
               <p>"Detain him so for five minutes, and then let him go where he will. This will
                  probably be a lesson to him."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes!" replied Desmondo bitterly. "I am learning fast."</p>
               <p>Stanley started for the door.</p>
               <p>Suddenly, Desmondo broke from his confinement and drew a revolver from his
                  back.</p>
               <p>Aiming at Stanley, he fired.</p>
               <p>A terrific shriek filled the apartment.</p>

               <p>THE "Orphean Lunch" was once more visited by the President and Vice-President of
                  the N. O. C.</p>
               <p>And it was also visited by the young man who had, on a former occasion, occupied
                  Number Two.</p>
               <p>After imbibing, the two officials of the Club entered into conversation.</p>
               <p>"So you had a narrow escape of it, you think?" said the President,
                  interrogatively. "What became of him after you shot him?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know," replied Desmondo, "that I <emph>did</emph> shoot him; in fact I
                  suspect that I did not—though I shot <emph>at</emph> him. But it was necessary to
                  make my escape as soon as possible. So I left without stopping to enquire after
                  the consequences of my sudden action."</p>
               <p>"That's bad; I'm afraid that instead of getting the better of this Stanley, he has
                  got the better of us; for, through some queer kind of proceeding, no less than
                  five of our boys are up for the Sessions."</p>
               <p>"No!" said Desmondo. "Then he has triumphed. There should have been a speedy end
                  put to him when we first spoke of it together. What the deuce could have tempted
                  him to be on the spot and spoil our sport? I don't understand it!"</p>
               <p>"I'll guarantee that all the trouble is caused by a woman in the fence somewhere.
                  Don't you know of one?" enquired the President.</p>
               <p>"Well," said Desmondo, as he drained his glass of brandy and water. "I think there
                  is one at the bottom of this mischief. In fact, I've seen her; but I don't know
                  who she is. I'd like to find her out."</p>
               <p>"Can't you do so?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know. But I'll try. This woman that I think of, though, as I say, I don't
                  know who she is, must have gained her information from Stanley. and has
                  undoubtedly seen Mr. Van Linden. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll see the latter
                  party in another disguise, and on pretense of doing him a benefit in some manner,
                  will endeavor to glean some intelligence from him."</p>
               <p>"That's the idea! Perhaps you'll be successful! I hope so; for matters look very
                  gloomy for us now."</p>
               <p>"All right—we'll see! But first: I intend to pay a call up in Seventeenth street.
                  You know the two 'Spanish ladies'—as they would like to be called—well, I've a
                  faint suspicion that I may find somebody there that I thought to be
                  elsewhere."</p>
               <p>"Aha!" said the President of the N. O. C., wonderingly.</p>
               <p>The young man in Number Two smiled very complacently to himself upon hearing this
                  conversation.</p>
               <p>"If the sea can give up the dead on resurrection-day," pursued Desmondo, "this
                  woman can be in New York, now, and so—"</p>
               <p>He stopped—in some abstraction.</p>
               <p>"And so," suggested his companion.</p>
               <p>"And so," said Desmondo, slowly, "maybe her partner—the man she told me—the
                     <emph>only</emph> man—she ever loved. Ah! I think I have them!"</p>
               <p>Upon hearing this the young man in Number Two descended from the chair and placed
                  his extended hand upon his heart.</p>
               <p>"No, no!" he murmured, agitatedly; "<emph>he</emph> is safe—we are both safe. But
                  the suspicion of this conscienceless devil is awakened, and we must tread
                  carefully, but speedily!"</p>
               <p>For a moment he applied his ear to the window, and then re-descended from the
                  chair and made his way from the "Orphean Lunch" and on the first corner, entered a
                  coach which was driven rapidly up town.</p>
               <p>The coach stopped at a house in Seventeenth street.</p>
               <p>It was a low-stooped, three-story house, its bricks dingy and unwashed—either from
                  the laziness of its occupants or a lack of Croton.</p>
               <p>It bore a very peculiar reputation in the neighborhood.</p>
               <p>People wondered that there were so many calls to the house—so many notes sent by
                  boys from the corner—so many visitors from men in queer colored cloaks up to
                  parties flashily dressed and men wearing shoulder-knots, who had managed to attain
                  a colonelship or some other home-guard position on the staff of some general that
                  was invariably assigned to a Home Department.</p>
               <p>There were very few signs of life about the house; but, every day after meridian,
                  carriages drove up, and Colonel Brown, of the Home Staff, or Mr. Muchmore, of
                  spectacles calling, were on hand.</p>
               <p>And it was noticeable in the neighborhood that Colonel Brown of the Home Staff was
                  followed and accompanied by a diminutive, deformed, small individual, who rejoiced
                  in the cognomen of Ledbert.</p>
               <p>And there never occurred a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bal masque</foreign> of the
                  Liedercranz, or the Arion, or, I imagine, any ball of <emph>prestige</emph>, when
                  there did not visit this house a Colonel or a jeweler or a merchant or an actor
                  or—I know not what.</p>
               <p>But they were always married men.</p>
               <p>This house was nominally the residence of Mr. Hallibutwise, who was, during the
                  winter months, disposed to make his home abroad.</p>
               <p>He had a wife.</p>
               <p>At least he regarded her as such.</p>
               <p>Her history was simple enough.</p>
               <p>At the age of fifteen, she had been married to a reckless, careless youth of
                  twenty, and, as a matter of course, within one year thereafter the happy couple
                  separated.</p>
               <p>The lady attained a divorce, by the consent of the happy youth of twenty, he
                  having become disgusted with the peculiar <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >penchant</foreign> displayed by his wife.</p>
               <p>Subsequently the party became Mrs. Hallibutwise; and, her husband being in foreign
                  parts, having stayed during the winter months, she chose to receive company pretty
                  generally and rather miscellaneously.</p>
               <p>She liked tall men; her first was tall, so was her second. She rouged her face and
                  then she powdered it. She put carnation upon her lips, which in their formation
                  bore the shape of a full-blooded African's. She put cosmetic upon her eyebrows,
                  and, after all this make-up, would say to you if you mentioned that she was "at
                  least thirty" by this time, that it was "very disagreeable." Such, hollow,
                  cold-hearted, vain and affected, (she had endeavored to make a sensation upon the
                  stage once) and aping "Cuban" airs, was Mrs. Hallibutwise.</p>
               <p>She is now sitting in her dining-room; apparently awaiting an arrival.</p>
               <p>A carriage drove up to the door.</p>
               <p>From it descended the woman in the light-blue veil, followed by Magdalena, who, by
                  this time, had somewhat recovered her composure.</p>
               <p>A brief conversation had occurred between the two women during their ride.</p>
               <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6970-00000026"/>
               <p>They entered the house.</p>
               <p>It was a matter of observation for Magdalena that her companion on entering the
                  house bore a more quiet and unassuming manner than she had formerly shown.</p>
               <p>The girl that opened the door said to her, with a slight Irish accent: "Sure, Mrs.
                  Hallibutwise is waiting for ye!"</p>
               <p>The woman with the light-blue veil made no reply, but led Magdalena into the
                  dining-room.</p>
               <p>In the peculiarly-framed chair that I have mentioned, which was supposed to be an
                  heir-loom of the Hallibutwise family, sat the afore-mentioned, would-be-Spanish
                  lady, smoking a cigarito.</p>
               <p>"Well, Clara—you've got back. I expected you some time ago."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I've returned, Leonora, and I bring a young friend with me. You
                  understand—or you remember, at least—the circumstances that led to her visit?"</p>
               <p>"I do; but care nothing about the matter. You do not play your cards half so well
                  as I do, sister."</p>
               <p>"Well, I mean to be honest about it, and despite all your influence, I
                     <emph>shall</emph> be in this case. Spare me all your reproaches upon this
                  night, and to-morrow my companion will return with no disrespect for us."</p>
               <p>And so Magdalena rested there for the first night. She slumbered by the side of
                  her rescuer. Notwithstanding the tears that sprung from her beautiful black eyes
                  when she thought of the villainy of the man she had so fondly loved, and who had
                  so basely betrayed her, the soothing voice and gentle assurances of her companion
                  eventually lulled her to a peaceful sleep.</p>
               <p>Poor girl! It was very fortunate this was her first love. Such always passes off
                  as easily as it comes upon us. Does it not, fair reader?</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXIX.</head>
               <p>ON the following morning, Mr. Linden Van Linden sat in his easy chair before the
                  desk that occupied a corner of his counting-room.</p>
               <p>Numerous letters lay before him, but met with no attention.</p>
               <p>The old man was sorrowful.</p>
               <p>Many a sigh he heaved and often he looked through the window pains.</p>
               <p>"Ah, mine is a hard fate" he thought; "the dear partner of my life Heaven saw fit
                  to take away—she, who left me one pledge of affection for whose happiness I have
                  almost worn my old frame out, and who, when I had accomplished all and everything
                  for her, deserted me—can she see my grief now? What to me is all the wealth that I
                  possess?"</p>
               <p>At this moment through the windows of the partition that divided his office from
                  the other part of his establishment, he perceived a woman.</p>
               <p>She wore a light-blue veil.</p>
               <p>Her carriage was dignified and queenly.</p>
               <p>An old man followed her.</p>
               <p>On entering the office, Mr. Van Linden mechanically pointed to a chair.</p>
               <p>The woman in the light-blue veil occupied it.</p>
               <p>The old man stood by the safe, leaning his elbow upon it.</p>
               <p>The voice of the woman was delicate, though firm, as she said:</p>
               <p>"Mr. Van Linden, I have come to do you a benefit."</p>
               <p>"Indeed?" said he, mechanically, "I fear no benefit can be done me now. I have
                  lost all that I cared for."</p>
               <p>"Say not so," remarked the woman. "Whatever sorrows may befall us, we should never
                  be hopeless. God has forbidden that, you know."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes—I know," said Mr. Van Linden. "And now I see that you have some
                  intention in calling upon me. You are not simply a causal visitor?"</p>
               <p>He left his seat and stood before her.</p>
               <p>"I am not. I <emph>had</emph> a design in calling upon you. I am at the same time
                  an avenger and a petitioner," and the woman passed her hand up under the veil.</p>
               <p>"How is that? do not understand you!"</p>
               <p>"Listen then Mine has been a chequered life and, though waited upon by many of
                  your sex, I have loved but one. Can you appreciate that?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I can!"</p>
               <p>"Aye, you can—for you have lost one that is dear to you."</p>
               <p>"What know you of that? What know you of my poor OUTCAST?"</p>
               <p>"I simply know that you have lost her. Continue to listen to me. Perhaps a
                  father's affection is greater than that of a woman for the chosen of her heart.
                  But, as I have said, I loved <emph>one</emph> man."</p>
               <p>"Well, what of it?"</p>
               <p>"That man," said the woman, coolly, "in a moment of deprivation and poverty,
                  committed a crime. I say to you, Mr. Van Linden, that I loved this man. I say to
                  you that I now love him."</p>
               <p>She paused.</p>
               <p>"Well, what is all that to me?"</p>
               <p>"You have met with a serious loss. The only being you loved has left you, and you
                  are a lonely, broken-hearted man."</p>
               <p>"Well, well; go on!" said the banker, nervously brushing his eyes.</p>
               <p>"Suppose I could restore her to you, would you do as favorable a turn to me?"</p>
               <p>"Would I—would I? But ah, what am I thinking of? She is lost to me forever."</p>
               <p>"Are you sure of that?"</p>
               <p>"Am I sure of daylight when I go to my bed at night, now, alas! <emph>not</emph>
                  to sleep?"</p>
               <p>The old man wept.</p>
               <p>"Stop! I wish to relieve you if I can," said the woman in a gentler tone of voice.
                  "You are mistaken!"</p>
               <p>"How? mistaken?"</p>
               <p>"Mistaken you are. But, pardon me? I cannot allow even my sympathy or you to run
                  away with my intention towards one near and dear to me. Can I, father?" she said,
                  turning toward the old man who had entered with her.</p>
               <p>This old man spoke not, but shook his head.</p>
               <p>"I do not understand you," said Mr. Van Linden.</p>
               <p>"Have you forgotten the late robbery of the Bank?" enquired the woman, in a
                  half-reluctant tone.</p>
               <p>"Forgotten? No, indeed! Troubles have fallen fast upon me lately."</p>
               <p>And he resumed his seat.</p>
               <p>"I know they have," resumed the woman. "Believe me, I fully sympathise with you.
                  But—"</p>
               <p>"But what?" enquired Mr. Van Linden, composing himself.</p>
               <p>"I mean to say," pursued the woman, "that while I would do you a benefit I must
                  drive a bargain with you to enable me to do it. This man that robbed the bank, or
                  has been held as responsible for the robbery, this man received no benefit beyond
                  a paltry two thousand dollars."</p>
               <p>"What!" exclaimed Mr. Van Linden, again arising. "He was a defaulter to the extent
                  of one hundred, and fifty thousand dollars!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, yes! But, in turn, he was robbed of that amount. Wasn't he, father?"</p>
               <p>And the old man, leaning upon the sofa, again said nothing, but bowed,
                  affirmatively.</p>
               <p>"Well," went on the woman. "What would you give to have returned to your arms your
                  daughter pure and virgin as you last saw her, unconnected and untainted by the
                  villain who has lured her from her home and your heart and affection?"</p>
               <p>"Ha! What mean you? Have <emph>you</emph> had aught to do with this most devilish
                  transaction? Say that you have, and—"</p>
               <p>"And what?" enquired the woman in the light-blue veil.</p>
               <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6970-00000027"/>
               <p>"I shall have an officer take you in charge."</p>
               <p>"Spare yourself the trouble and do not let your grief make you foolish and
                  self-injurious."</p>
               <p>She seemed pensive as she continued:</p>
               <p>"You are not a miser, Mr. Van Linden?"</p>
               <p>"Miser! am I? Do I not do all in my power to help the poor—to practice charity?
                  All that I am worth I labored to obtain only for the comfort and establishment of
                  the poor daughter who is now only an outcast!"</p>
               <p>"Are you sure? Wait a moment! This cashier of your bank—say that he had repented
                  of his crime and could tell you where the money that he, in an unfortunate time,
                  stole, has gone to; say that he could return to you your daughter and could say to
                  you that he, at the very time and during the whole time that you have been duped
                  by the dissembling villain who caused you this great sorrow, has watched over the
                  daughter who was so dear to you;—suppose he should say all this and tell you that
                  he could betray to you the spot where the plunder is located and also point out to
                  you distinctly, not only the party who possessed his vile gang with it, but all
                  those who belong to the crowd. Would you forgive him and aid him to make up the
                  balance of his defalcation over what may be obtained from the present
                  possessors?"</p>
               <p>"If all you say could be proved to me, I <emph>would</emph> do so. My poor
                  Magdalena has become an outcast. When she left me as she did, utterly regardless
                  of my suffering and blighted life, I did not curse her; I was angry, but I did not
                  curse!"</p>
               <p>"Is it, then, a bargain between us?" enquired the woman.</p>
               <p>"It is!"</p>
               <p>"Enough, then!" and the woman spoke in much warmer tones. "But, bush! here
                  comes—"</p>
               <p>All glanced out, and the old man murmured as he surveyed one who was entering the
                  house: "it is he!"</p>
               <p>This person, who claimed the attention of Mr. Van Linden's company, was apparently
                  a man of some sixty years of age and bore about him the brusque and lively air so
                  well-known to grace the appearance of Wall street brokers—an air so indicative to
                  the unknowing ones of piety, and mental as well as physical cleanliness—in fact, a
                  very venerable class.</p>
               <p>He did not raise his glance until he had entered the counting-room.</p>
               <p>Then he did; and started with surprise.</p>
               <p>His discomposure was unnoticed save by the millionaire, who looked at him
                  curiously.</p>
               <p>And such was the nature of the look that the new-comer gave to the old man whose
                  arm still leaned upon the sofa.</p>
               <p>"Good day, sir," said Mr. Van Linden. "What can I do for you?"</p>
               <p>But the party who had just appeared did not seem disposed to answer.</p>
               <p>And the woman spoke.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Van Linden, do not let this party deceive you; he is nothing more nor less
                  than the ex-Spanish-grandee, the ex-music master, the ex-Mr. Youngson, who brought
                  forged papers to you from California—the man who, by means of his accursed
                  hypocrisy and well-assumed virtues, lured your daughter from her, till then, happy
                  home. He has assumed a fresh disguise for some purpose—the nature of which I can
                  well imagine; but <emph>you</emph> cannot, as the later incidents connected with
                  Magdalena are unknown to you."</p>
               <p>"Yes—but <emph>you</emph> are not unknown to <emph>me,</emph> now," said the
                  apparent old man, who had just entered. "Suffice it to say that I have just
                  returned from Seventeenth street, and your beloved sister ter has given me the
                  whole history of your action in this matter!"</p>
               <p>The speaker threw off his wig and whiskers, and, with a defiant demeanor, revealed
                  the Senor Desmondo.</p>
               <p>"Where are your natural gorgeous hairy adornments?" enquired the woman, with
                  bitter sarcasm.</p>
               <p>"Do you imagine that you can interfere with my plans?" enquired Desmondo.
                     "<emph>You,</emph> a—"</p>
               <p>"Spare your amiable terms," replied the woman. "I do not intend to trouble you in
                  your intentions. I leave that to proper officials; it is their task—not mine!"</p>
               <p>"Indeed!" responded Desmondo, with a bitter sneer. "How do you propose to have
                  that accomplished?"</p>
               <p>"Villain! I will see that it is accomplished!" exclaimed Mr. Van Linden, "you
                  shall not escape justice this time. Call an officer!" he continued, turning to his
                  clerk.</p>
               <p>"One moment," said the woman in the light-blue veil, laying her hand gently upon
                  the shoulder of the millionaire. "You have made me a promise—you will abide by it,
                  will you not?"</p>
               <p>The old man who had been loaning upon the sofa slightly raised himself and
                  listened with anxiety for Mr. Van Linden's answer.</p>
               <p>It came at length.</p>
               <p>"I will cover all, and take my chances for such redemption as may be made me. I do
                  this for <emph>her</emph>!"</p>
               <p>He sank upon his chair in tears.</p>
               <p>"Enough! The one you mourn as lost shall be returned to you as soon as I
                  promised."</p>
               <p>The woman in the light-blue veil lifted that adornment of her beautiful head and
                  turned to Desmondo.</p>
               <p>"Clara!" said he. "I presume that you expected to surprise me. I have told you
                  already that I knew who you were. And how is your husband, Benedict Arnold
                  Stanley?"</p>
               <p>"Your pleasantry is misplaced, altogether," replied the woman. "No matter what
                  your influence has been over my sister, it is of no importance to me.
                     <emph>My</emph> object is now accomplished, and your villainy defeated. You
                  well know that the man you designate by the name of Stanley, was, but is
                     <emph>not</emph> my husband. You can imagine that I hold control over him by
                  simply giving him a divorce. You know that I am intimate with all the manœuvres of
                  your so-called N. O. C. and that I could betray them when I choose."</p>
               <p>"Ah!" said Desmondo. "It is a great pity that I did not know you in your younger
                  days: you and I would have made a good match!"</p>
               <p>"Cease, sir! I would no more be related to you than I would my once-husband, whom
                  I have bound by self-interest to conduct the plans which I laid to catch you in
                  your base acts; have I not succeeded, <emph>father?</emph>"</p>
               <p>She turned to the old man who had been leaning on the safe.</p>
               <p>His form became immediately erect, and the eye that had been mild before, now
                  became fiery.</p>
               <p>"You have! Desmondo, as you would call yourself, when I was as an old man, you
                  stole from me—as an old man, I bring you to justice. You are completely betrayed
                  and exposed, and by this time the authorities are in possession of the funds that
                  I purloined from the bank and you stole from me."</p>
               <p>"Aha!" said the Senor. "Entrapped, hey! Well, it's time, then, for me to be
                  going."</p>
               <p>And he started for the street.</p>
               <p>But four men barred his passage.</p>
               <p>One of these he recognized as the President of the N. O. C. and another as
                  Stanley. The other two he knew not.</p>
               <p>With a horrible oath Desmondo flung himself at Stanley.</p>
               <p>"There's your wife!" he cried. "Take her to hell with you, and this be your
                  good-speed!"</p>
               <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6970-00000028"/>
               <p>Saying this, Desmondo drew his knife, evidently with the intention of stabbing his
                  bitterest enemy to the heart. But his hand was arrested by one of the two men whom
                  he did not know, and who were detectives in citizen's dress.</p>
               <p>Foiled in his dearest revenge, with the swiftness of lightning he aimed a blow at
                  the detective, thrusting the knife through the fleshy part of his arm, and thus
                  inflicting a serious, though not dangerous wound.</p>
               <p>By this time the second officer had pinioned Desmondo from behind, loudly calling
                  upon the President of the N. O. C. and Stanly to assist him. But the latter was so
                  amazed for the moment on discovering that the lady with the light-blue veil was
                  his former wife, that he stood staring at her like one bereft of his senses.</p>
               <p>As for the President, who had been playing a double game with Stanly, in order to
                  help his companion in crime, when the right moment arrived he gave his assistance
                  in a manner wholly unexpected to the others.</p>
               <p>Hastily drawing a slung shot, with a nervous flourish, he struck the officer such
                  a blow on the head as would have killed an ox.</p>
               <p>These things occurred in much less time than it has required us to describe them,
                  and being now free, the two villains were able to make their escape before any
                  considerable alarm had been created.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXX.</head>
               <p>It was evident from the insinuations thrown out by Desmondo, as recorded in the
                  last chapter, that he had paid a visit to Seventeenth-street, after the departure
                  of Clara, who had left Magdelena in charge of her sister, Mrs. Hallibutwise.</p>
               <p>We will avail ourselves of the liberty of an author, and just drop in, to take
                  notes of this interview.</p>
               <p>Desmondo was admitted by the servant, who conducted him to the parlor, saying that
                  her mistress would be down in a moment.</p>
               <p>He had not long to wait, and as Mrs. Hallibutwise entered the room, he put on one
                  of his most winning smiles, exclaiming—</p>
               <p>"Ah, my dear Leonone, I am very happy to meet you again."</p>
               <p>"The happiness is all on your side, sir," she replied coldly.</p>
               <p>"Ho, ho! my lady has donned her airs this morning, and plays the Spanish <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">Noblesse</foreign> to a charm!"</p>
               <p>"Why have you called on me?" she inquired, without heeding his sarcasm.</p>
               <p>"To congratulate you on the safe return of your sister Clara, after her recent
                  trip to Europe, in company with Swinzer, late cashier of the Alsatia Bank,"
                  replied Desmondo.</p>
               <p>Leonore gave a sudden start, slightly changing color. These signs were sufficient.
                  Desmondo knew he had hit the nail upon the head, although his remark had been made
                  at a venture.</p>
               <p>But Leonone quickly recovered her self-possession, and in a tone of well feigned
                  surprise, exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Indeed! And pray when did my sister arrive, since you seem to know more of her
                  movements than I do?"</p>
               <p>"In time to take Magdalena Van Linden in charge, and prevent my marriage with the
                  heiress of the old millionaire."</p>
               <p>Again Leonone started in astonishment, and believing that her sister had betrayed
                  herself in some manner, after reflecting for a moment upon what course it was best
                  to pursue under the circumstances, an entire change took place in her manner.
                  Turning to Desmondo, she enquired of him, in the tone of a captive to a
                  conqueror—</p>
               <p>"What terms do you propose?"</p>
               <p>These two thoroughly understood each other. There was no occasion for hints, and
                  beating about the bush. So they came directly to the point. Desmondo regarded her
                  with his calculating eyes for nearly a minute, and then replied—</p>
               <p>"To see Magdalena immediately."</p>
               <p>"And Clara—have you not already denounced her and Swinzer?"</p>
               <p>"No, their secret is safe, so far as I am concerned, and shall remain so, if you
                  will at once conduct me to Magdalena."</p>
               <p>"You knew she was here, then?"</p>
               <p>"Yes." [O, what a whopper!]</p>
               <p>"Will you do more than keep the secret of my sister and her lover—will you help to
                  screen them, if necessary.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I pledge my word."</p>
               <p>"Follow me."</p>
               <p>Leonone led the way up stairs, and having pointed to the door of a small, back
                  pallor, very discreetly retired.</p>
               <p>Desmondo raised the latch and entered without knocking.</p>
               <p>Magdalena was sitting upon a small divan, so deep in thought that she did not
                  observe the opening and closing of the door, which Desmondo silently bolted after
                  him.</p>
               <p>Magdalena was thinking over all her acquaintance with Senor Desmondo, and in the
                  simplicity of her heart, wondering if he was not good and noble, in spite of all
                  that had happened. To one of her romantic nature, whose mind had been stored with
                  fiction, more than the realities of life, it did not seem impossible but he might
                  be the victim of a foul conspiracy.</p>
               <p>And then she thought how his noble nature must suffer. Her fancy drew a picture of
                  him in his dreary solitude—an exile and a stranger, with not even <emph>one</emph>
                  pitying eye to look upon him in his bitter anguish. Perhaps at that very moment he
                  was contemplating suicide as the only remedy for his deep wrongs.</p>
               <p>With her feelings thus stirred by the workings of her imagination, and her eyes
                  fixed on vacancy, she rose to her feet, stretched forth both of her arms,
                  exclaiming:</p>
               <p>"Dear Desmondo, there is <emph>one</emph> to pity and love you—<emph>one</emph>
                  who believes you innocent."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, darling—thank you," said Desdemondo, quickly advancing and folding her
                  in his arms.</p>
               <p>Magdalena uttered a scream and would have fallen, had he not sustained her. She
                  verily believed for a moment that she had seen an apparition—a shadowy spectre
                  from the invisible world—in short, the ghost of Desmondo.</p>
               <p>He led her back to the divan, where he seated himself, and in her half-fainting
                  condition, drew her down upon his knees.</p>
               <p>"Maggie, my angel," he began, "did they nearly break your heart by that fiendish
                  conspiracy? And you almost believed what that vile woman—that—but I will not shock
                  your ears by telling you what she is. You almost believed the charges she made
                  against me, didn't you, darling?"</p>
               <p>Magdalena made an effort to reply, but her feelings overpowered her and she burst
                  into tears.</p>
               <p>"Don't weep, dear," continued Desmondo, speaking very tenderly, "I am unworthy of
                  your tears." Fortune has made me her foot-ball, and I now see that I was wrong in
                  aspiring to the hand of one whose pathway in life had ever been strown with
                  flowers. I <emph>did</emph> come here to ask you to fly with me from the
                  persecutions of my enemies; but I now repent the thought—the dearest sweetest
                  thought of my life—and after seeing you safe in your own house, I will go away
                  alone, where I can die without bringing sorrow upon the only lady I have ever
                  loved, or ever can love."</p>
               <p>"You—going—away?" faltered the poor girl, between her sobs.</p>
               <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6970-00000029"/>
               <p>"Yes, my precious one, I have discovered that my enemies, who drove me from Spain,
                  and now riot upon the riches which rightfully belong to me, have followed me with
                  their persecutions even to America. To them am I indebted for all the false
                  accusations which have been brought against me. They are rich and powerful—rich
                  with <emph>my</emph> gold—while I am poor and friendless—unable to cope with them.
                  Therefore, nothing remains for me but to escape and conceal myself, or remain and
                  fail a victim to their hellish plots."</p>
               <p>"But where—will—you go?"</p>
               <p>"I shall disguise myself and remain here in the city for a short time, and when a
                  good opportunity offers, flee to the sunny South, where the climate and people are
                  more congenial than here at the North."</p>
               <p>"O, Desmondo—if I could only trust you!"</p>
               <p>"Trust me, sweet girl? my life is at your disposal."</p>
               <p>"You are good and noble, are you not?"</p>
               <p>"Your heart tells you so, dearest, and a heart so pure as Magdalena's could not
                  whisper a falsehood."</p>
               <p>"My heart tells me I can trust you and yet I have such terrible misgivings."</p>
               <p>"No wonder you have misgivings, for even your father, who is a shrewd man, and not
                  liable to be deceived, has been misled by the cunning of my enemies, and actually
                  believes me to be an impostor."</p>
               <p>"And I believed so too, last night."</p>
               <p>"But to-day?"</p>
               <p>"To-day I am in doubt. But who are these people in this house? They appear to be
                  my friends?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Appear</emph>! Yes, no doubt they do <emph>appear</emph> so; but had they
                  been your friends in <emph>reality</emph>, would they not have restored you at
                     <emph>once</emph> to your father, instead of bringing you here to be kept as a
                  prisoner!"</p>
               <p>"A prisoner!"</p>
               <p>"That is what I said, and that is what I meant."</p>
               <p>"But why?"</p>
               <p>"Can you not guess?"</p>
               <p>"Indeed I cannot."</p>
               <p>"Have you no idea of the character of this house?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know what you mean."</p>
               <p>"In a word then—do you know that this is <emph>worse</emph> than a house of
                  assignation?"</p>
               <p>Magdalena uttered a slight scream and threw her arms about the neck of the
                  villain, as if for protection.</p>
               <p>Desmondo had gained his point, Magdalena could not imagine any reason why she had
                  not been taken directly to her father's house, for Clara did not explain to the
                  poor girl that she was retaining her as a sort of hostage, in order to make peace
                  with her father, in behalf of Swinzer. Had Clara done this, there would have been
                  less danger of Magdalena being caught in the snare which Desmondo was so
                  ingeniously spreading for her.</p>
               <p>But now the explanation which he gave seemed perfectly rational, and added greatly
                  to her returning confidence in the pretended exile.</p>
               <p>No doubt Desmondo shrewdly suspected the game that Clara was playing, but whether
                  she won or lost, was a matter of indifference to him. He had his own game to play,
                  and what was more, he meant to <emph>win</emph>.</p>
               <p>Completely mystified by the circumstances which surrounded her, and shuddering at
                  the thought of the danger she had escaped by remaining so long as she had in such
                  a house, Magdalena now said imploringly—</p>
               <p>"You will not leave me here, Desmondo?"</p>
               <p>"No, my angel, it was to secure you from the hands of these vampires that I came,
                  intending to ask you to follow me into my second exile. But now my heart fails me
                  in making the request. I did not intend giving all these explanations, but thought
                  to get you from this house, upon some pretext that I should invent, without your
                  having discovered its character. But somehow the purity of your presence so acts
                  upon me that I cannot deceive you even when the deception would be to your
                  benefit, and so I have told the truth in spite of myself. But come, darling, you
                  have already been too long in this den of infamy."</p>
               <p>"Where will you take me?"</p>
               <p>"To my heart," he exclaimed, as though rendered suddenly frantic at the idea of a
                  final separation. Unresistingly he pressed her soft form to his bosom, while he
                  concealed his face upon her white shoulder, pretending to be almost suffocated
                  with his emotions.</p>
               <p>"Dear Desmondo," said Magdalena, tenderly, "do you really love me so very
                  much?"</p>
               <p>"Love you!" he exclaimed, starting up wildly, "Love is no name for the worship and
                  adoration your name inspired in my heart. Love you! God only knows how dearly I
                  love you, for I can never express it in words."</p>
               <p>"Then why should we be separated?"</p>
               <p>"Because in the excess of my devotion I cannot bear to drag my idol—the favored
                  child of fortune—down to a level with my own wretchedness and misery."</p>
               <p>"Would you not be willing to make sacrifices for me, Desmondo?"</p>
               <p>"Sacrifices! there is nothing I could not sacrifice for your dear self—almost my
                  hopes of eternal happiness."</p>
               <p>"And think you I am less noble—less selfish! But it would be no sacrifice on my
                  part, to share the lot of the man I loved, be i ever so humble."</p>
               <p>"You <emph>will</emph> fly with me then, and be mine, and mine only, through all
                  coming time?"</p>
               <p>"And a never ending eternity!"</p>
               <p>The unscrupulous villain had now gained more than he had even dared hope for.
                  Magdalena was not only willing to go with him, but actually <emph>asked</emph>
                  him, indirectly, to take her into his keeping.</p>
               <p>The preparations were speedily made and leaning upon his arm, together they left
                  the room.</p>
               <p>At the foot of the stairs they encountered Leonone, who could hardly believe her
                  senses, when she saw Magdalena leaving the house so lovingly with Desmondo.</p>
               <p>"Everything has been satisfactorily explained, Mrs. Hallibutwise," exclaimed the
                  latter, "and you need be under no apprehensions of any kind. The whole matter must
                  be kept a profound secret, and no one need ever know that this lady has been in
                  your house. Be discreet, and you may rely upon me—otherwise, beware."</p>
               <p>Of course Leonone understood the remark one way, and Magdalena another—just as he
                  intended, for he wished to avoid any explanation between the two.</p>
               <p>But there was not much danger. Leonone thought only of the safety of Clara and her
                  lover; while Magdalena, believing Leonone to be a vile woman, had no desire to
                  even bid her good-day.</p>
               <p>So Desmondo got away very cleverly, and having conducted Magdalena to a safe
                  retreat, where no one who had ever known her would be likely to make search, and
                  of which we shall have more to say anon, Desmondo hurriedly proceeded to the shop
                  of the Jew, Moses, where he disguised himself as an old man, for the purpose of
                  making a call upon Magdalena's father, the result of which call we have already
                  seen.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXI.</head>
               <p>"Stop thief! A thousand dollars to the man who will catch the villain!" shouted
                  Mr. Linden Van Linden, running to his office door a moment after Desmondo and the
                  president of the N. O. C. had made their exit, as recorded in chapter twenty
                  nine.</p>
               <p>"Who? What! Where?" were sounded in chorus by stockbrokers and gold dealers as
                  they gathered about the door, thus affording a rampart behind which the fugitives
                  made their escape.</p>
               <p>Then some one glanced through the open door—saw a man lying there, apparently
                  dead, and another with the blood dripping from the ends of his fingers, which
                  flowed from the wound Desmondo had inflicted in his arm.</p>
               <p>Instantly attention was concentrated inside the office. Of course every one was
                  anxious to rush in and render important assistance, each believing that
                     <emph>he</emph> could be more useful than any one else.</p>
               <p>But Mr. Van Linden thought only of capturing the abductor of his daughter, and
                  when he found that no one heeded his appeals, resolved to follow the scoundrels
                  himself.</p>
               <p>Resolving, however, just at that crisis in affairs, was much easier than
                  doing.</p>
               <p>The current of human beings from the outside, flowed to the doorway, pressing
                  forward to gain admission, each ambitious to be first.</p>
               <p>Mr. Van Linden, vociferating at the top of h s lungs, was at the same moment
                  blocking up the passage, and making frantic efforts to rush into the street.</p>
               <p>"Let us in!" shouted the crowd.</p>
               <p>"Let me out!" bawled the millionaire.</p>
               <p>"What's the row?" enquired a policeman, who had just put in an appearance.</p>
               <p>"Old money bags is expecting to be confined," responded a loafer, to the
                  policeman.</p>
               <p>"I'll confine you—you bloody vagabond," rejoined the policeman, diverted from
                  attending to the business of the public, in order to punish a personal insult.</p>
               <p>"Catching before hanging," shouted a voice in another part of the crowd.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I'll catch you—you thieving loafer," replied the policeman, <choice>
                     <sic>forgeting</sic>
                     <corr>forgetting</corr>
                  </choice> the first insult in his wrath for the second, and making a rush through
                  the crowd.</p>
               <p>"That 'Copp' is <emph>coppered</emph>, and I'll bet fifty he loses on the turn,"
                  exclaimed a faro dealer, as he joined the crowd.</p>
               <p>"Who are ye pushing <emph>aginst</emph>! I'll give yer a punch in the jaw!"
                  exclaimed a "Bowery Boy," as a pale looking youth, whose upper lip was ornamented
                  with a feeble moustache, crowded against him.</p>
               <p>At this moment the contending currents at the doorway reached a crisis. "Might
                  makes right," the world over, and in spite of his almost superhuman efforts to
                  reach the street, Mr. Van Linden was forced back into his office, which, in a
                  moment, was so snugly packed that it was difficult for any man to tell which pair
                  of legs he used in making his entrance.</p>
               <p>But this hubbub, like everything else, except a circle, a woman's tongue and
                  eternity, at last came to an end. Other policemen were soon upon the ground—the
                  office was cleared, and then an explanation took place.</p>
               <p>Then everybody blamed everybody for not catching the bloody villains; each
                  declaring that if he had been in the place of either of the others, they would not
                  have got away.</p>
               <p>But a good ten minutes had been lost, and half that time would have sufficed for
                  the President and his worthy Vice, of the N. O. C., to secure a safe retreat from
                  any crowd in New York.</p>
               <p>When the policemen had fairly succeeded in bringing order out of chaos, in the
                  office of Mr. Van Linden, that worthy gentleman suddenly turned all his thoughts
                  upon the safety of Magdalena. He realized that he had been thwarted only in his
                  vengeance, and as his passion subsided, l e eared but little about that so long as
                  his daughter, still pure and uncontaminated, remained to him.</p>
               <p>"Now, Madam," he said, turning to Clara and her <emph>father</emph>, whom the
                  reader has no doubt recognized as Swinzer, "I have promised all you asked, and
                  even more—now conduct me to my daughter."</p>
               <p>"You would not object putting your promise in writing?" enquired Clara.</p>
               <p>"Not in the least—make the bond as strong—"</p>
               <p>"No, no," interrupted Swinzer, "the <emph>word</emph> of Mr. Linden is stronger
                  than any bond which a lawyer can frame."</p>
               <p>"Come, then," said Clara, as she proceeded towards the door.</p>
               <p>"One moment, Mr. Van Linden," put in the coroner, as he saw the millionaire about
                  to depart. "This is a serious matter—a man killed in your office—your testimony
                  will become highly important."</p>
               <p>"Nothing serious, Mr. Coroner," replied a young physician, who had been examining
                  the detective on whom the slung shot of the President of the N. O. C. had taken
                  effect—"nothing serious, I assure you. There is no fracture of the skull—merely a
                  slight abrasion in the region of the coronal suture, super-inducing coma from the
                  concussion."</p>
               <p>"I don't understand you," rejoined the coroner, who seemed determined to hold an
                  inquest, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">nolens nolens</foreign>.</p>
               <p>"He means the man is only stunned," replied a white haired Professor of Surgery,
                  who had also been called in to render assistance; word having been circulated
                  outside that five men had been killed and three mortally wounded.</p>
               <p>"O!" exclaimed the coroner, as he fairly comprehended the situation of affairs,
                  and glided out in search of a job in some other direction than Wall street.</p>
               <p>"I will meet you at the house," said Clara to Swinzer, as she took a seat beside
                  Mr. Van Linden, in his carriage.</p>
               <p>Clara gave him the direction to Seventeenth street, and they immediately set
                  forth.</p>
               <p>Swinzer still kept up his incognito—not from any fear of Mr. Van Linden, but
                  because he wished to avoid a scene, by making himself known among so many old
                  acquaintances.</p>
               <p>Taking the more unfrequented thoroughfares, in order to avoid the crowding masses
                  of Broadway, Mr. Van Linden drove with all possible speed to the residence of Mrs.
                  Hallibutwise.</p>
               <p>Leonone chanced to be at the window as the carriage drove up, and as she knew Mr.
                  Van Linden by sight, like a flash of electricity came the thought that it was
                  herself instead of Clara who had played her cards bad, for she now divined the
                  object of her sister in getting Magdalena into her custody.</p>
               <p>But she had no time for reflection before Clara and Mr. Van Linden entered the
                  parlor.</p>
               <p>"Please be seated, sir, while I call your daughter," said Clara, glowing with hope
                  and happiness.</p>
               <p>In her eagerness to fulfil her part of the contract, Clara did not think of the
                  common civility of giving her sister an introduction to the millionaire, and the
                  latter had his mind too much occupied with other matters to heed this breach of
                  etiquette. It is doubtful, in fact, if either of them even thought of Leonone.</p>
               <p>Clara tripped lightly up the stairs,<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6970-00000031"/> into
                  the room where she expected to find Magdalena. But she was not there. Then she ran
                  into her bedroom which she found vacant. Flying from room to room—up stairs and
                  down to the basement—in five minutes she had searched the house through, but still
                  no Magdalena.</p>
               <p>With a strange misgiving, she knew not why, she rushed back to the parlor. Her
                  sister was still standing by the window, while Mr. Van Linden had his eyes fixed
                  on the carpet, as though estimating its value.</p>
               <p>The latter raised to his feet as Clara entered, expecting to see his daughter. The
                  look of dismay upon her features made him pause, while she almost screamed
                  out—</p>
               <p>"Leonone! Where is Magdalena?"</p>
               <p>"Gone," replied Mrs. Hallbutwise, in a tone of deep mortification.</p>
               <p>"Gone?" echoed Clara, staring wildly at her sister.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Gone</emph>!" sighed Mr. Van Linden, sinking down into his seat and
                  covering his face with his hands.</p>
               <p>"Where?" exclaimed Clara, rushing up to Leonone and <choice>
                     <sic>seizeing</sic>
                     <corr>seizing</corr>
                  </choice> her rudely by the arm.</p>
               <p>"I don't know."</p>
               <p>"How long has she been gone?"</p>
               <p>"About two hours."</p>
               <p>"Did any one come for her?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Who?"</p>
               <p>"Desmondo."</p>
               <p>"Desmondo! And is she again in his power?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Desmondo</emph>!" groaned the Millionaire, as he shook like a strong man in
                  convulsions.</p>
               <p>Leonone now briefly related all that had transpired, connected with the visit of
                  Desmondo and his <choice>
                     <sic>departue</sic>
                     <corr>departure</corr>
                  </choice> with Magdalena, not even concealing the motive which had induced her to
                  permit the villain to have an interview with his victim.</p>
               <p>"Fool! Idiot!" hissed Clara through her set teeth, as she flung her sister
                  violently against the window.</p>
               <p>"My poor daughter," groaned Mr. Van Linden, "now indeed has she become an
                     <emph>Outcast</emph>."</p>
               <p>Clara, usually so calm and self-possessed, seemed to lose all self control, and
                  raved like an insane person. Perhaps it was not so much on account of her sympathy
                  for Magdalena, as on account of the effect she feared her disappearance might have
                  upon the prospects of her lover.</p>
               <p>As for Mr. Van Linden, the excitement which had hitherto sustained him having now
                  given place to despair, he leaned back on the divan—the same where his child had
                  been seated not three hours before—as helpless as an infant.</p>
               <p>Leonone had actually became terrified at the rage which her sister manifested, and
                  watching her opportunity, retreated from the parlor to her own room where she
                  locked and bolted the door.</p>
               <p>Clara was still pacing the room, in a tumult of passion, when her attention was
                  attracted towards Mr. Van Linden by his groans of bitter anguish.</p>
               <p>The pale and haggard expression of his countenance frightened her. She thought he
                  was dying.</p>
               <p>"Are you ill? Shall I call a physician? What can I do for you?" she asked
                  hurriedly, as she went forward and knelt at his feet, for Clara, whatever were her
                  faults of education and habit of life, was really a kind hearted woman.</p>
               <p>"Take me home," he moaned feebly, "take me home to die."</p>
               <p>She assisted him upon his feet, but his strength failed him, and he sank back
                  again upon the divan.</p>
               <p>Clara was now terribly alarmed. Rushing to the door of her sister's room she
                  knocked furiously, exclaiming—</p>
               <p>"Leonone—come, quick—Mr. Van Linden is dying!"</p>
               <p>Knowing by the tone of Clara's voice that her passion had subsided, and that there
                  was now cause for other fear than the loss of Magdalena, Leonone hastily unbarred
                  the door and followed Clara into the parlor.</p>
               <p>Leonone was more self possessed than her sister, and understanding that the sudden
                  enervation of Mr. Van Linden was the result of a powerful reaction of his nervous
                  system, caused by the rapid transition from hope to despair, she flew to a closet,
                  and taking down a bottle of brandy, poured out half a goblet, which she held to
                  his lips until he had drained the last drop.</p>
               <p>The brandy soon set the machinery of life in motion again, and by the assistance
                  of the two ladies, Mr. Van Linden was enabled to go out and enter his
                  carriage.</p>
               <p>Without a word, Clara seated herself by his side, and gathering up the reins, said
                  to Leonone as she drove away—</p>
               <p>"As soon as Alonzo returns, tell him to resume his natural appearance and follow
                  me as quickly as possible. I shall remain with Mr. Van Linden until he
                  arrives."</p>
               <p>The servants of the millionaire were not a little surprised at seeing their master
                  return to his house at that hour of the day, the carriage driven by a strange
                  lady, whose face was concealed by a light-blue veil.</p>
               <p>"Assist Mr. Van Linden into the house," said Clara, making an imperious gesture,
                  as the servants appeared in answer to her summons.</p>
               <p>Together with the brandy and the violent emotions through which he had recently
                  passed, Mr. Van Linden was now in a sort of stupor—hardly conscious of where he
                  was or why he was anywhere.</p>
               <p>Yielding as passive as a child, he allowed the servants to carry him into his
                  magnificent mansion—up to his sleeping room—where they laid him on his bed.</p>
               <p>"Now fly, one of you, for the family physician," ordered Clara, as though mistress
                  of the house.</p>
               <p>All wondered who the queenly lady was, but no one dared disobey. Two or three
                  would start at once to obey her orders, until, pointing with her finger, she would
                  fairly snap out—</p>
               <p>"<emph>You!</emph> the rest remain!"</p>
               <p>Dr. Pulsifer, the family physician, had his residence near by, and happening to be
                  at home, soon appeared at the mansion of the millionaire, in answer to the hasty
                  summons.</p>
               <p>During this time Clara had not been idle. The butler had been summoned, and by her
                  orders had removed Mr. Van Linden's wearing apparel, and he was now comfortably in
                  bed.</p>
               <p>Dr. Pulsifer carefully examined the patient, but seemed puzzling over the
                  diagnosis, without which, there was no predicate for a prognosis.</p>
               <p>He looked towards the servants for an explanation, but they shrunk away from his
                  glance in bewilderment. Clara alone met his look of enquiry without faltering, yet
                  her face wore an expression of the deepest anxiety.</p>
               <p>"Can you enlighten me, madam," said the doctor, "in regard to the events connected
                  with the sudden illness of Mr. Van Linden?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," she replied, "but he would probably prefer that none but his friends
                  should be made acquainted with them."</p>
               <p>The servants failed to take the hint thus thrown out. Clara did not wait for the
                  doctor to speak, but immediately turning towards them, said—</p>
               <p>"You can retire—if you are needed I will ring for you."</p>
               <p>Left alone with the doctor and his patient, Clara lifted the light-blue veil,
                  disclosing her really beautiful face, and briefly narrated the events of the
                  day.</p>
               <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6970-00000032"/>
               <p>Dr. Pulsifer was amazed. He had known Magdalena from her infancy, and she seemed
                  to him almost like a daughter.</p>
               <p>But the precarious condition of Mr. Van Linden demanded his whole attention,
                  leaving but little thought to bestow upon the deceived and misguided
                  Magdalena.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXII.</head>
               <p>WE return to Desmondo, whom we left in company with the President of the N. O. C.,
                  making his escape from Wall street.</p>
               <p>Reaching Broadway without any adventure, they hailed the first stage, and taking a
                  seat inside, quietly proceeded up town until they arrived in the vicinity of where
                  Moses Sheeny, their Hebrew friend, kept his shop.</p>
               <p>Here they left the stage, and after a careful survey about, to assure themselves
                  that they were not watched, they hurried through a cross street—turned down an
                  alley—then into another cross street, and safely entered the den of Moses without
                  having attracted any attention.</p>
               <p>An hour afterwards, one of them left the place so thoroughly changed in appearance
                  that even Stanly, had he been watching, could not have told whether it was the
                  President or Vice President, save by the stature.</p>
               <p>Fifteen minutes later, Desmondo came out. His disguise, too, was perfect—his own
                  mother,—if such villains are ever blessed with a maternal relative—would not have
                  known him.</p>
               <p>He wore a wig of bushy red hair—with whiskers and eye-brews to correspond. His
                  face was freckled, and on his nose was mounted a pair of huge, golden-bowed
                  glasses, attached to his west by a piece of black cord. He sported a small cane,
                  and altogether, bore a striking resemblance to that nondescript which seems a
                  cross between a human being and a puppy—politely called a <emph>dandy</emph>.</p>
               <p>Desmondo sauntered along very leisurely, twirling his cane and occasionally making
                  a half pause to examine some person or object, just as he had seen the half-witted
                  bipeds do, of whom he was a fit representative.</p>
               <p>Taking the direction of the Five Points, he turned up a dirty alley, in the
                  suburbs of these classic precincts, and having with much difficulty forced his way
                  through a crowd of ragged children, he finally paused before an ancient,
                  dilapidated, two-story building. Having glanced up and down the alley, with his
                  accustomed caution, he entered the open door and ascended a flight of rickety
                  stairs.</p>
               <p>There were two rooms on this floor—one in front and the other back. He proceeded
                  to the door of the back-room and having knocked in a peculiar manner, the door was
                  opened by the relies of what had once passed for a handsome woman. Her original
                  name, no person of her present acquaintance ever knew—perhaps in the multiplicity
                  of her alliasses she had even forgotten it herself. But at present she was known
                  to those with whom she did business, as a "Mother Mum." This <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">sobriquette</foreign> was bestowed upon her by a former patron,
                  in consequence of the pertinacity with which she could remain silent upon certain
                  topics demanding secrecy. As Mother Mum, then, we will introduce her to the
                  reader.</p>
               <p>Apparently sixty years old, she was in reality little more than forty. Her hair
                  was white and black—about half and half. Her countenance was very expressive, and
                  she could look either the saint or fiend, according to circumstances. Of low
                  stature—plainly, but rather neatly dressed, her character may be summed up with
                  the quotation—"a bold, bad woman."</p>
               <p>She greeted Desmondo with a stare, which seemed to say—"who the devil are
                  you?"</p>
               <p>"All right, Mother Mum," exclaimed the representative dandy, well satisfied with
                  his disguise, since even the sharp eyes of his companion in crime had failed to
                  penetrate it.</p>
               <p>"But who are you?" she enquired, still barring the doorway with her dumpy
                  figure.</p>
               <p>"Con of Pe-Vee," he replied.</p>
               <p>"The devil you are!' exclaimed the old woman in a whisper—"who do you think would
                  know you in them rum togs? But come in, for the bloss is getting cranky.</p>
               <p>Saying this, Mother Mum stepped into the narrow passage, allowing Desmondo to
                  enter the back room, while she very prudently went into the one in front.</p>
               <p>Lest the reader may not fully comprehend the magical password by which Desmondo
                  made himself known, we will analyze and explain it.</p>
               <p>"Con of Pe-Vee," may be expressed thus—C. O. N. of P. V." Read these initials
                  backwards, and we have "V. P. of N. O. C., representing "Vice President of N. O.
                  C."</p>
               <p>If the reader is <hi rend="i"/>Not Over Curious, he will not care anything about
                  the symbolic letters—"N. O. C.," or what they mean. But the printer
                     <emph>is</emph> over curious, and after studying the rule—Numerals Only Count,"
                  took up his slate and ciphered out that they stood for "Not Our Crowd." However he
                  is Not Over Cute, and Nobody Of Course. But if the reader will only be patient, we
                  promise to explain the meaning of these letters, all in good time.</p>
               <p>From this mystical explanation we will return to Desmondo.</p>
               <p>The room we have just seen him enter, was plainly furnished, yet there was an air
                  of neatness and order about it, which could hardly have been expected in that
                  locality, or from the appearance of the house outside.</p>
               <p>As the reader already anticipates, this room was occupied by our heroine—the sole
                  heiress of the Fifth Avenue millionaire. She was there, too, of her own free
                  will.</p>
               <p>At first thought, this would seem impossible, save on the supposition that she was
                  either insane or an imbecile. But Magdalena was neither. She went there in
                  obedience to the holiest emotion of which a woman is susceptible—<emph>a sacrifice
                     of self for the man she loved.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>True, she was the victim of a foul conspiracy, and went there to her ruin. Yet so
                  far as <emph>she</emph> was concerned, the virtue of the sacrifice was as great as
                  it would have been if her betrayer had been what she believed he was; and were I
                  the book-keeper for "The great day of assize," I would enter this act to Magdalena
                  on the credit side of the ledger, to foot up in her favor, when there was a final
                  balancing of the account.</p>
               <p>As for the <emph>result</emph>, Magdalena was not in the least responsible. No
                  matter if the consequences which afterwards followed led her on until her criminal
                  career culminated in the commission of a cold-blooded murder; yet for
                     <emph>this</emph> step, no blame could possibly attach. True, she committed a
                  grievous error, but it was an error of judgment, the responsibility of which must
                  rest upon those who had been her teachers and advisers in the past.</p>
               <p>Magdalena was sitting in a cane-seat chair, her elbow resting on an old pine
                  table, her aching head supported in her hand. She had not heard the colloquy at
                  the door, and from the delay which followed the knock of Desmondo, before he
                  entered, she had concluded that it was some one else—for her thoughts were busy
                  with the idol of her affections—him for whom she had sacrificed so much.</p>
               <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6970-00000033"/>
               <p>"Ah, my precious one," exclaimed Desmondo, approaching and laying his arm across
                  her shoulders. "I fear you have been impatient, for I was delayed by the business
                  which called me out."</p>
               <p>Magdalena was at first frightened at the familiarity of one she thought an entire
                  stranger, but the moment she heard his voice, she knew it could belong only to the
                  unfortunate Spanish nobleman.</p>
               <p>"Dear Senor," she said, yielding to his caress, "your disguise is indeed perfect,
                  for although I have been expecting you for more than an hour, and had become very <choice>
                     <sic>anxioas</sic>
                     <corr>anxious</corr>
                  </choice> lest some accident had befallen you; still I had not even the most
                  remote idea that it was you who entered the room, until your dear familiar voice
                  betrayed you."</p>
               <p>"And even that I can change when necessary," he replied in a tone so different
                  from any she had ever heard from his lips, that she involuntarily looked around,
                  as though expecting to see a third person behind her.</p>
               <p>"A friend has gone for a clergyman," continued Desmondo, "and will be here within
                  half an hour. Then my beloved we shall be joined so fast that no earthly power can
                  sunder the tie. After that death alone will separate us."</p>
               <p>Was it her good angel, whispering in the ear of Magdalena, that made her shudder
                  and recoil from Desmondo, at this announcement? Or was it but the natural timidity
                  of her sex?</p>
               <p>"Do you already repent your promise to become my bride?" inquired Desmondo
                  tenderly.</p>
               <p>"No, not that, my chosen one, but these strange feelings which come over me, I
                  don't know how to describe them."</p>
               <p>"It is nervousness my darling—nothing but nervousness, occasioned by the
                  excitement of the last twenty-four hours."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps it is—yes, it must be," she replied absently, as though unconscious of
                  what she was saying.</p>
               <p>Nor was she fairly conscious—her nervous system had in fact been severely
                  taxed—her brain was in a whirl, and her mind wholly incapable of a rational
                  conclusion on any subject.</p>
               <p>"My father—my poor father!" she at length murmured in a tone of deep feeling; "did
                  you see or hear from him this morning, Desmondo?"</p>
               <p>"No, sweet, I did not—I was so busy in arranging my own affairs, and making
                  preparation for a life of seclusion with my heart's idol, that I had no
                  opportunity to make inquiries concerning him or I certainly should," he replied,
                  drawing up a chair and sitting down beside Magdalena.</p>
               <p>"Were it not for the anxiety which I feel on his account, I should not be haunted
                  with such misgivings in relation to the step I have taken, and the more important
                  one I am about to take."</p>
               <p>"A good daughter always makes a good wife, Magdalena, and this very anxiety of
                  which you complain, eminently adds to your worth."</p>
               <p>"But you will see my father soon, will you not, and explain all?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, my dear, as soon as I can with safety. But a short delay will be
                  necessary, in order that the strong prejudices which he now harbors against me may
                  have time to subside. Besides, you remember that I am surrounded by
                  enemies—dangerous enemies—who would not scruple to accuse me of any crime—even
                  murder itself—that I might be thrown into prison."</p>
               <p>"But I can see him without danger, and I will plead with him for you—he will not
                  deny my prayers—the prayers of his only child."</p>
               <p>"Cold indeed would be that heart which could refuse the prayers of so fair a
                  petitioner."</p>
               <p>"Yes, he will take me back to his heart—I know he will—and then we shall be so
                  happy," said Magdalena, her face aglow with hope.</p>
               <p>Poor, simple-minded girl! she little dreamed, then, of the terrible fate that was
                  in store for her.</p>
               <p>They sat in silence for a few moments, both deep in thought. Yet how different the
                  channels in which their thoughts flowed.</p>
               <p>Desmondo was carefully calculating his chances of success in getting possession of
                  Mr. Van Linden's vast wealth. Once married to Magdalena, he would use her as a
                  tool, or hold her as a hostage, according to circumstances, and thereby bring her
                  father to terms.</p>
               <p>Magdalena was busy in the architectural and mechanical—she was rearing airy
                  castles, in which she saw Desmondo lord and master. She saw him welcomed as a son
                  by her father—triumphant over his enemies, and at last restored to his ancestral
                  rights of birth and fortune. She saw herself ever by his side, as scene after
                  scene passed in view before her eye of fancy, each more brilliant than the last.
                  Then the denouement—the grand culminating point in life, when he would take her to
                  the Spanish Court—when she would be introduced to the queen—envied more as the
                  wife of so distinguished a nobleman, than for her own beauty and
                  accomplishments.</p>
               <p>Dream on, poor girl; it is your last bright dream. The network of villainy has
                  encompassed you about on every side. The black clouds are settling low in your
                  horizon. Your sun of happiness is sending forth its last brilliant rays and then
                  it will go down in gloom forever.</p>
               <p>Dream on—luxuriate in this paradise of fancy, for a terrible awaking is at
                  hand.</p>
               <p>Dream in haste, poor <emph>Outcast</emph>—quaff greedily from every cup of
                  happiness which your fancy can picture, for a banquet of horror is being spread
                  for you, and every cup of bitterness you shall drain to the dregs.</p>
               <p>Dream of Sylvan bowers—of fairy grottos—of cooling zephyrs and fragrant flowers,
                  for henceforth you shall live in the slums of New York, inhaling the poisonous
                  gases, the associate and equal of those you loathe-languishing with
                  disease-praying for death, and yet doomed to live.</p>
               <p>And why must this fair girl be thus doomed? Because of the sins of her father.
                  "The sins of the father shall be visited upon the children to the third and fourth
                  generation," says the Bible.</p>
               <p>Mr. Linden Van Linden sinned by bringing up his daughter in idleness. Idleness is
                  the great shoal in the ocean of life, on which nine-tenths of the vicious and
                  depraved make shipwreck of every hope in the future.</p>
               <p>"Money is the root of all evil." A free rendering of this passage, will signify
                  that the making of large fortunes, in the hands of a few individuals, is attended
                  by great evils. Perhaps the forty years employed by Magdalena's father, in
                  collecting his millions, had been attended by the loss of forty young girls,
                  reduced to the condition of night walkers—these shameless creatures who jostle
                  against us on the street, and as we look round, expecting to greet a friend, are
                  met with that steady gaze from some poor wanton, who is obliged to pursue her
                  wretched calling in this manner or <emph>starve</emph>.</p>
               <p>Mr. Van Linden was not aware that he had ever caused even <emph>one</emph> poor
                  girl to sin, and would have felt himself deeply wronged had such an insinuation
                  been made against him. And yet such was in all probability the case. We have but
                  to trace back for the remote cause, and we shall find that these things are of
                  daily occurrence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Van Linden had amassed his millions. Those millions came from somewhere. Trace
                  them back to their original sources. Not a penny of those millions was produced
                  save by the sweat of the brow. All visible wealth is the product of labor. And
                  what did<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6970-00000034"/> he give in exchange for those
                  millions? Simply tact and cunning. He was a "shrewd financier," and that tells the
                  whole story. In reality, he gave <emph>nothing;</emph> then somebody was the
                  loser, and when traced back, it will be seen that the real losers were the
                  laborers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Van Linden drew these millions from the natural channels of business. Then a
                  scarcity must have been produced in those channels. And when there is a scarcity,
                  who are the greatest sufferers? The weakest always.</p>
               <p>These heavy drafts caused temporary derangment in business, falling most heavily
                  upon the small capitalist. That small capitalist was a manufacturer and gave
                  employment to poor girls. He must retrench—perhaps suspend his business. His
                  employees are thrown out of situations. In vain they seek for work. There is none
                  for them. Business has been disturbed—the capitalists are all busy in taking care
                  of themselves until things settle back in their old channels. It is not a
                  panic—only a slight disturbance which will regulate itself in a few weeks, and
                  soon be forgotten.</p>
               <p>But what is to become of the poor girls during this time? Nobody knows and nobody
                  cares. Yet when the small manufacturer is ready to start up again, and begins to
                  look for his old hands, he is astonished to find so many of them have become
                  "bad."</p>
               <p>As often as once a year, upon an average, during forty years, in which to
                  accumulate millions, Mr. Van Linden must have been accessory to producing one of
                  these "slight disturbances," to say nothing of the great money crises which seem
                  to occur periodically. Then who will dare say that our estimate of forty young
                  girls lost, that he might become a millionaire, is too large?</p>
               <p>But sins never go unpunished. A retribution is at hand, and the Great Executor of
                  natural law will not allow Mercy to tip the beam against Justice. Those millions
                  of Mr. Van Linden must flow back into their original channels, and Magdalena must
                  pass through the furnace of affliction, as a terrible warning to others.</p>
               <p>We left her in the enjoyment of a bright dream, which she accepted as a
                  foreshadowing of her brilliant future. She is awakened by a knock at the door—the
                  same peculiar knock which Desmondo had given.</p>
               <p>The Senor is aroused, too, from his golden dream, and hastily arises to answer the
                  summons.</p>
               <p>The intruder is none other than the President of the N. O. C., accompanied by a
                  clergyman. They enter and take seats. Mother Mum is called in from the front room.
                  No explanations are necessary, for all understand the parts they have to play.</p>
               <p>"Come, my love," says Desmondo, taking the hand of Magdalena.</p>
               <p>"She starts nervously—turns deathly pale, and for a moment seems to hesitate. It
                  is the last effort of her good angel to save her. It is the last prompting of her
                  womanly instincts, which have been constantly crying out "beware!"</p>
               <p>But a spell of the enchanter is upon her. She drives back every thought save the
                  one—to become the bride of the noble Spanish exile.</p>
               <p>With an effort she struggles to her feet. Her hand is still clasped in that of
                  Desmondo, who nods for the clergyman to proceed.</p>
               <p>With deep solemnity the marriage ceremonial is performed, and before two witnesses
                  they are pronounced <emph>husband</emph> and <emph>wife!</emph>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXIII.</head>
               <p>IT was the morning following the day when Mr. Van Linden had been taken home by
                  Clara, in an almost unconscious scious state. The doctor did not leave him until
                  near midnight, and has now just returned.</p>
               <p>Clara has not left him for a moment. Another watcher has been there and is equally
                  attentive. It is Swinzer, the repentant cashier.</p>
               <p>Mr. Van Linden has not spoken since being put into his bed. His system needed
                  rest, to give the vital powers a chance to recuperate. Therefore the physician has
                  kept him under the constant influence of opiates. But now he is beginning to
                  arouse. His eyes open, and he scans each face in the room. He is looking for
                  Magdalena. His memory now seems to return—he recalls the past—hope dies within
                  him, and with a deep groan he again closes his eyes as if to shut out the horrible
                  picture his fancy has drawn.</p>
               <p>Ten minutes elapse. Fain would he have died, but the relentless hand of destiny
                  demanded one more act from him, and then his earthly mission would be at an
                  end.</p>
               <p>Again his eyes unclosed; consciousness was perfect, and he felt in haste to play
                  the last act in the drama of life—to dispose of his immense wealth in such a
                  manner that Desmondo and his villainous confederates might never be able to touch
                  one penny of it.</p>
               <p>A long conference was held with Dr. Pulsifer, Swinzer and Clara. Full explanations
                  and satisfactory pledges were given. Then a lawyer was sent for—a new will made,
                  whereby he bequeathed all he possessed to Swinzer and Clara. The latter having
                  obtained a divorce from her brutal husband, there was no longer any impediment to
                  her union with the man she loved, and their marriage took place by the bedside of
                  the dying man.</p>
               <p>But his daughter—the erring Magdalena—he could not cut her off beyond all
                  hope.</p>
               <p>Writings were so drawn up and executed that Magdalena, at any time she might
                  abandon Desmondo, should be put in possession of seven-eighths of her father's
                  wealth. The power to enforce this agreement was delegated to Dr. Pulsifer, but not
                  specified in the will, lest Desmondo, by some new trick, might be able to use
                  Magdalena as a tool for getting possession of what had already been the source of
                  so much suffering to others, and was now causing so much anguish to its
                  possessor.</p>
               <p>Dr. Pulsifer was empowered to act as trustee, and exercise his discretion in the
                  premises, as if Magdalena had been his own daughter.</p>
               <p>These arrangements were at last completed. Now nothing remained for Mr. Van Linden
                  to do, after all his life-long toils and struggles to become a millionaire, but to
                  die and leave his treasures behind. The clergyman who had married the repentant
                  Swinzer, still remained, and performed the last sad rites for the dying.</p>
               <p>Day waned into evening—evening into night. Lower, and still lower fell the pulse
                  of Mr. Linden Van Linden.</p>
               <p>The old church clock was upon the stroke of twelve. There was a quivering of the
                  eyelids—a few gasps—a slight struggle, and then the spirit of the millionaire took
                  an eternal leave of its tenement of clay.</p>
               <p>Three days the mortal remains lay in state at the Van Linden mansion, and then
                  they were borne in solemn pomp to their last resting place, to become food for
                  worms and be dissolved into their original elements.</p>
               <p>To the slimy worm, the crumbling flesh of a wretched pauper, would be just as
                  sweet as that of the haughty millionaire. Then where is the benefit of hoarding,
                  when the culmination, after a brief struggle, is to die and leave it for another
                  to scatter? The soul is dwarfed, the intellect cramped and misery the only
                  realization. Like poverty<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6970-00000035"/> ty, its
                  opposite extreme, wealth always brings suffering in its train of evils. Happiness
                  can be found only between the extremes.</p>

               <p>The moon had fulled and waned—renewed herself and is once more upon the full. This
                  was the honey-moon of Magdalena. For a whole month she had been the wife of the
                  man she loved, and for whom she had deserted her dying father. Has the change
                  brought happiness? We shall see.</p>
               <p>"The infernal old knave! Disinherit his only child in favor of the thief who
                  robbed him! I hope he is roasting in hell this very minute, and I should like to
                  be overseer devil, detailed to stir him up with a bar of red hot iron!"</p>
               <p>"Of whom are you speaking, Desmondo?" said Magdalena, gently, laying her trembling
                  hand upon his arm, for already she feared the villain as much as she had loved
                  him.</p>
               <p>"Bah!" flinging off her hand as though her touch was loathsome—"Of whom should I
                  be speaking but your swindling old father, who has left his millions to that thief
                  of a Swinzer, and gone to hell where he belongs."</p>
               <p>"Dear Desmondo—"</p>
               <p>"Don't 'dear' me, beggar—I hate you!"</p>
               <p>Magdalena struggled against an inclination to burst into tears, and finally
                  asked—</p>
               <p>"How long has my poor father been dead?"</p>
               <p>"The old cheat died the day we were married, and I did not think he had made a new
                  will until to-day. Here is the <title>Herald</title>—you can read for
                  yourself."</p>
               <p>Saying this, he drew a paper from his pocket and handed it to Magdalena. It was
                  the first newspaper she had seen since entering the miserable den where she had
                  been kept a close prisoner, under pretence that <emph>his</emph> safety might be
                  endangered if she ventured out. She often asked to see the daily papers, but was
                  always put off on some pretext or other, and in the simplicity of her heart, never
                  complained.</p>
               <p>She took the offered paper, and with a swelling heart and moistened eyes, read the
                  proceedings had in Probate Court in reference to her father's will.</p>
               <p>Poor girl! Those scalding tears are not shed for loss of wealth and station, for
                  as yet these are losses which she cannot realize. But they are the sad tokens of a
                  daughter's love, mingled with remorse for having so cruelly deserted her only
                  surviving parent, at the very moment when he most needed her womanly tenderness to
                  smooth his pathway to the grave.</p>
               <p>Weep on, poor <emph>Outcast</emph>! They are holy tears you are shedding; but when
                  the chaliced cup shall be held to your lips, then every tear shall be such a
                  concentration of agony that you will wonder how so many can be wrung from your
                  tortured heart, without forever silencing is spasmodic throbbings.</p>
               <p>Desmondo was nervously pacing the floor. All the fierce passions of his strong
                  nature were aroused. For months he had plotted and toiled, and when the prize
                  seemed already within his grasp, to have it thus snatched away beyond all hope of
                  possession, so enraged him that he seemed more like a wild beast than a human
                  being.</p>
               <p>Like all brutal men when in a passion, his instincts led him to take vengeance on
                  some one, who, least of all, merited his unkindness.</p>
               <p>Had he obeyed the first promptings of his impotent rage, he would have knocked
                  down and beaten poor Magdalena. But upon second thought, the fiend within him
                  devised a more terrible revenge.</p>
               <p>For half an hour he continued his heavy tramp, maturing a dark plot, at the
                  contemplation of which even devils must have grinned with delight. Then turning to
                  his anguish-stricken wife, in a harsh tone, he said—</p>
               <p>"Well, beggar, have you nothing to say?"</p>
               <p>By a powerful effort she mastered her emotions, and then replied—</p>
               <p>"O, Desmondo, kill me if you will, and do it quickly; but do not rack my already
                  torn and bleeding heart with such cruel words. It was not my fault that my poor
                  father made a new will; or if I was the cause, blame yourself for persuading me to
                  leave him at a time when I should have been at his bedside ministering to his last
                  wants. Besides, we can live without his wealth. We can teach music, and I will
                  work, O, so hard, and we may yet be very happy. And then your estates in
                  Spain—"</p>
               <p>"Estates in Spain be—!" We omit the oath which fell upon Magdalena's ear. Then
                  turning fiercely upon her he be added—"you may as well know, first as last, that
                  the 'Spanish nobility' story was a mere <emph>stall</emph> to <emph>bilk</emph>
                  the old <emph>bloke</emph>."</p>
               <p>"Stall to bilk the old bloke?" echoed Magdalena—"I do not understand you?"</p>
               <p>"The story was all <emph>nums</emph>, I tell you."</p>
               <p>"And what does '<hi rend="i"/>nums' mean?"</p>
               <p>"It means <hi rend="i"/>sham. I wanted the <emph>honey</emph> of old
                     <emph>gripe-fist</emph>, your father, and so <emph>rigged</emph> you with the
                  Spanish <emph>gammon</emph>."</p>
               <p>"Do you mean by all this that you are not a Spanish nobleman, and that you have
                  deceived me by a falsehood?"</p>
               <p>"That is just the way to say it in plain English."</p>
               <p>"If you are not a <choice>
                     <sic>Spainard</sic>
                     <corr>Spaniard</corr>
                  </choice> then what are you?"</p>
               <p>"I'm a <emph>gip</emph>."</p>
               <p>"Do tell me what you mean?"</p>
               <p>"In plain English, then, a <emph>gonnoff</emph>, and too sharp for the
                     <emph>fly-cops</emph>; that is to say, I stand at the head of professional
                  thieves in New York—am too sharp for the sharpest officer to catch me, and Vice
                  President of the N. O. C."</p>
               <p>"O, Heavens! Is it for this that I abandoned my father in his dying hour, to find
                  myself the wife of an out-law? But no—you surely cannot mean what you say—it was
                  but to make a trial of my love—all your coldness of late has only been for that
                  purpose—is it not so dear Desmondo? Say it is so, and I will forgive everything—I
                  will live even in a worse place than this—will work—will perform the most menial
                  services, only unsay those bitter words—say that you are not a thief and—"</p>
               <p>"There, stop that chin music and listen to me. I married you only to get your
                  father's money—not that I ever loved you, for your silly ways were always
                  disgusting. Now I have got you, but having missed the money, I hate you."</p>
               <p>Having said this, Desmondo turned and abruptly left the room.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXXV.</head>
               <p>Magdalena awoke the following morning with all her thoughts in a state of wild
                  chaos. The last she could remember, she was in the room which had so long been as
                  a prison to her, with Desmondo and a strange man. They were drinking wine, and had
                  persuaded her to drink also.</p>
               <p>She looked about the room—nothing seemed familiar. Was she hallucinated? She
                  rubbed her eyes and looked again.</p>
               <p>"Desmondo—my husband!" she exclaimed.</p>
               <p>"Well, my dear, I answer to the name of husband, but not Desmondo," replied the
                  stranger of the previous evening, stepping from the recess of a<pb n="70-71"
                     xml:id="VAC6970-00000036"/> bay window, where he had hitherto been
                  concealed.</p>
               <p>Magdalena uttered a scream and covered her face with the counterpane.</p>
               <p>"Ah, my lady bird, you need not appear so timid, considering the
                     <emph>intimate</emph> relations which already exist. Desmondo would have turned
                  you into the street, and then caused your arrest as a night walker had I not paid
                  him five hundred dollars for the privilege of bringing you to these nice
                  apartments, where you are not only imperial mistress, but mistress of my heart's
                  deepest adoration."</p>
               <p>We need not dwell upon the painful details of this interview. Suffice it to say,
                  Magdalena became but too well assured of Desmondo's base treachery to entertain a
                  single doubt as to the relation existing already between herself and the
                  stranger—a relation to which she had never yielded her consent.</p>
               <p>She had been drugged and carried off she knew not where, and was once more a
                  prisoner. Already she had stepped into the great ocean of degradation which lay
                  before her, and to one of her weak nature there seemed to be no retreat.</p>
               <p>Politely, even kindly, he had answered all her questions. The gentleness of his
                  manners afforded a contrast so pleasing to what those of Desmondo had been of
                  late, that with her moral nature so crushed under the thought that she was already
                  disgraced beyond all hope of redemption, that she yielded a tacit assent to the
                  wishes of her new master.</p>
               <p>George Clinton was descended from one of the oldest and wealthiest families of
                  America. Brought up to habits of indulgence, he knew nothing about practising
                  self-denial, and therefore had no thought for the sacrifices made by others, so
                  long as he was not thwarted himself.</p>
               <p>He loved Magdalena for the time being as well as it was possible for him to love
                  any one, simply because she was a novelty. But in less than a month the novelty
                  faded and she became distasteful.</p>
               <p>Then she was passed over to a friend of her purchaser, who in turn wearied of her,
                  and thus she advanced, each change being for the worse—each step sinking her
                  deeper and still deeper into that vortex of degradation, from which after a woman
                  has taken the first step, there seems no escape save by the hand of death.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXVI.</head>
               <p>We now look in at Magdalena, after a lapse of one year from the date when she was
                  abandoned by her husband. We shall continue to call her Magdalena, although she
                  has never called herself thus since separating from George Clinton. She has
                  adopted various names, not necessary to enumerate, and now she is an outcast
                  indeed.</p>
               <p>Great and many have been the changes wrought in her during this eventful year.
                  From being unsophisticated in the ways of vice—ignorant of the thief's slang—she
                  has become an adept in everything which tends to the degradation of woman.</p>
               <p>Not only can she speak the language of a thief fluently, but she has learned all
                  their tricks for deceiving the unwary. At the same time, by her superior
                  education, she could pass herself as a lady of refinement. Thus she became the
                  most dangerous woman in New York.</p>
               <p>Having hired a room in a retired portion of the city, she furnished it in the most
                  elegant style, and within she decoyed her dupes, where she robbed them in the most
                  ingenious manner. The place was at last broken up by the police, the particulars
                  of which we have obtained from a young man, recently appointed on the Detective
                  Force. This young man, whom we will call Frank White, was an orphan, brought up by
                  his father's brother, with whom he was living at the time.</p>
               <p>His uncle came home to dinner one day, laughing at a singular adventure said to
                  have happened to a gentleman from New Orleans, who was making a brief stay in the
                  city. He had told his melancholy story to the Chief and got well laughed at,
                  because he was not believed. Mr. White said just enough about it to excite his
                  nephew's curiosity, and as Frank was particular to note the name and address of
                  the Southerner, he called on him the next day and got all the particulars.</p>
               <p>It seems that Mr. Southerner, who gave the name of John Davis, was sauntering
                  along the street one night in quest of adventure, when he was accosted by a very
                  genteel looking lady who inquired of him the direction to some part of the city
                  with which he was not familiar.</p>
               <p>Mr. Davis was pleased with her appearance, and although he could not give the
                  information she desired, he volunteered to find some one who could, and to render
                  her any other assistance in his power.</p>
               <p>She accepted his polite attentions with a gracious smile, and they at once entered
                  into a lively conversation. Presently they met a policeman, and he was about to
                  make the necessary inquiry, when his fair companion checked him by saying she now
                  remembered where she was, and therefore it was unnecessary for him to take the
                  trouble of inquiring.</p>
               <p>They continued to walk along together for several blocks, chatting with all the
                  ease and familiarity of old acquaintances, when he ventured to offer her his arm.
                  She accepted it with a seeming mixture of reluctance and pleasure, which inspired
                  his confidence still more, that she was a true lady.</p>
               <p>His next advance was a proposition to go home with her. O, no—she couldn't think
                  of such a thing—her husband was a sea captain—would be home in a week, and if he
                  found it out would kill her. This only had the effect to make Davis more anxious,
                  and as she had acknowledged to her husband being away from home, he redoubled his
                  entreaties and finally she consented.</p>
               <p>She conducted him to a part of the city where he had never been before, and so
                  intent was he in listening to her charming conversation, that he did not even
                  notice the appearance of the houses or the name of the street. She paused at
                  last—produced a night key—unlocked a door—entered, and he followed her up stairs
                  without seeing any other person.</p>
               <p>Of course the reader has already divined that this fascinating lady was none other
                  than <emph>Magdalena the Outcast</emph>.</p>
               <p>Conducting Mr. Davis to her luxurious apartment, she apologised for the presence
                  of a bed in it, by saying that it was for the accomodation of her husband's father
                  and mother, who frequently paid her a visit and remained all night.</p>
               <p>She further volunteered the information that her own bedroom adjoined, pointing to
                  the door of a closet, which was barely large enough to admit a person in a
                  standing position.</p>
               <p>She detained Mr. Davis by her pleasing conversation until a very late hour, and
                  when he at length arose to depart, invited him to remain and sleep in the "spare
                  bed."</p>
               <p>Nothing loth, he accepted the invitation. She bade him a pleasant good night,
                  retired to her—<emph>closet</emph>, locking the door on the inside.</p>
               <p>Without the least suspicion, her dupe disrobed himself, leaving his money in his
                  pockets and his watch upon the bureau. But just as he was about to step into bed,
                  he felt the floor suddenly sinking under him, and before he could grasp at
                  anything to save himself, he<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6970-00000037"/> was fairly
                  out of sight and in total darkness. It now seemed that he was sliding down an
                  inclined plane, smooth and well greased. As for stopping himself, that was
                  impossible. And as to what was to be the final result of this slide down hill, so
                  different from what he had been expecting, he had not the remotest idea.</p>
               <p>On—on, and still on, he continued to slide, as helpless to resist as a ship on the
                  ways at launching, until his feet met with a slight obstruction, which instantly
                  yielded to his weight and momentum, and the next moment he was landed on the
                  ground. He was now in the open air, apparently in a back yard, and alone in his
                  glory. Turning about, he glanced up to the side of the building to discover the
                  opening where he had made his slippery exit, but to his utter amazement no opening
                  was to be found—the wall of the house presented a smooth, solid surface, without
                  door or window.</p>
               <p>He now realized, as any man in his situation might, that a trick had been played
                  upon him, and concluded that his safest plan was to get out of the neighborhood as
                  speedily as possible. Fortunately the gate was not fastened, and passing through
                  he entered a narrow passage way, by following which he soon reached the street.
                  Here fortune seemed to favor him again, for a covered carriage stood at the outlet
                  of the passage, the driver in his seat, the carriage door open. In he sprang and
                  shouted out to the driver, "Astor House." Jehu cracked his whip and he was soon
                  jolting over the pavement.</p>
               <p>Arrived at the hotel the driver kindly loaned him his long overcoat wherewith to
                  cover the grease with which he was smeared—followed him to his room where he
                  arrayed himself in another suit—followed him to the office where he borrowed five
                  dollars and gave to John for his kindness and trouble, when the latter thanked him
                  and took his departure. And this was the story about his "taking a shute," which
                  the police did not believe, for the very plain reason that there were no such
                  traps as "shutes" in New York.</p>
               <p>But Frank White was more credulous than the older heads, and believed the story,
                  not so much because he had ever heard of those kind of tricks being played upon
                  travellers, but from the truthful appearance of Mr. Davis. And believing it, he
                  became anxious to discover the location of the ingenious contrivance. So he at
                  once made an arrangement with the duped Southerner to effect the object. Their
                  plan was this:</p>
               <p>He should disguise himself every evening, when Frank would meet him, and together
                  they would scout the city in search of Magdalena, the pretended wife of a sea
                  captain, and when found, Davis was not to allow her to discover who he was, but
                  permit Frank to try his luck through the "shutes."</p>
               <p>To complete the arrangement, and render young White as apparently worthy of
                  Magdalena's queenly snare, Davis supplied the unfledged detective with a brilliant
                  display of paste diamonds, together with a heavy guard chain, neatly plated with
                  gold.</p>
               <p>For more than a week, every night found them industriously tramping the streets,
                  looking in vain for the fair thief. At last their patience was rewarded. Davis
                  pointed her out and immediately fell back in the rear. Frank was a young man of
                  twenty then—stood six feet in his stockings, and without vanity, might have said
                  that he was good looking. He approached with the easy manners of one accustomed to
                  good society, and as though she was an old acquaintance said:</p>
               <p>"Ah, Mary, good evening—this is really an unexpected pleasure, for I thought you
                  would not be able to come out to-night."</p>
               <p>She took his proffered hand—pressed it very cordially, and with a most winning
                  smile replied—</p>
               <p>"You are doubtless mistaken—and yet your looks are so familiar that you seem like
                  some friend I have known and forgotten."</p>
               <p>"O, so I am mistaken—I trust you will pardon me, for really—"</p>
               <p>"No apology is necessary—so don't mention it," she said, interrupting him, and at
                  the same time taking an inventory of his person from head to foot. "Do you reside
                  in the city?" she continued, apparently satisfied with his appearance.</p>
               <p>"No, madam," he replied with a bow, "I belong to St. Louis, and I am only hero on
                  a visit at my uncle's, and having never seen my cousins until yesterday, you can
                  readily understand how I happened to mistake you for his daughter Mary."</p>
               <p>"Is your cousin Mary pretty?"</p>
               <p>"Indeed I think she is very beautiful."</p>
               <p>"And you think I resemble her?"</p>
               <p>"Enough to be her twin sister."</p>
               <p>She heaved a deep sigh, which seemed to say, I wish I was his cousin too. But
                  Frank understood her tactics—that she was waiting for him to make advances, so
                  that he should have no suspicions of her (and really so ladylike was her
                  appearance, that but for the story of Davis about the "shute" she had given him,
                  Frank would never have suspected her as other than a lady of fashion and
                  refinement). So he suggested, since he was doomed to be disappointed in having his
                  cousin for a companion, that he should be delighted to be her escort, that they
                  might cultivate the acquaintance begun in so romantic a manner. She made some
                  feeble excuses about the impropriety of trusting to strangers, but finally
                  consented.</p>
               <p>From this point in the programme, Magdalena made no material variation in her plan
                  of proceeding from that carried out in the case of the duped Southerner. But Frank
                  was careful to observe every street they traversed, and being familiar with the
                  different localities, easily did so, without appearing in the least to notice
                  where he was going.</p>
               <p>Her meanderings and wanderings were numerous, and to one less acquainted than he
                  was, must have created confusion, for she passed the house once, which she finally
                  entered, apparently trying her utmost to confuse him.</p>
               <p>At last they were in the room from which he expected to depart by way of the
                  "shute." Frank found everything just as described by Davis, and congratulated
                  himself that he would soon be able to solve the mystery.</p>
               <p>The evening passed away very agreeably, Magdalena striving her utmost to make the
                  hours seem as but minutes.</p>
               <p>At last, when Frank proposed to take his departure, she pressed him to remain and
                  occupy the "spare bed." He did not attempt to disguise the pleasure he experienced
                  in accepting her gracious invitation, and with a tender good night, she retired to
                  the closet.</p>
               <p>Of course, Frank was not in the least inclined to leave his clothing and false
                  jewelry with the treacherous Magdalena, but fully garbed, with hat and boots he
                  stepped towards the head of the bed.</p>
               <p>As he expected, part of the floor instantly sank under his feet, and the next
                  moment he was "taking the shute," <foreign xml:lang="FRA">a la</foreign> Davis.
                  All was now pitch darkness, proving that by some ingenious contrivance the trap
                  door was made to resume its place, after spilling its victim into the passage.
                  Frank landed safe, without any injury, in the same back yard—hurried through
                     the<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6970-00000038"/> gate, down the narrow passage way,
                  and not much to his surprise, saw a covered carriage—door open—driver on his
                  seat—just as described by Davis.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XXXVII.</head>
               <p>THIS carriage arrangement was a part of the plot, so cunningly devised by
                  Magdalena. Selecting her victims from among strangers, she well knew that if they
                  could reach their hotels without being discovered, they would much rather submit
                  to their loss in silence, than risk an exposure which might prove rather damaging
                  to a good reputation.</p>
               <p>Consequently the driver was always on hand, and if the poor fellow, scudding under
                  bare poles, was too confused to engage his services, the driver would call out to
                  him—"have a carriage?" without appearing to notice his forlorn condition.</p>
               <p>Then that long overcoat reaching to his heels, enabled the victim to dodge in—the
                  driver always offering to get his key at the office, and never annoying him with
                  questions prompted by idle curiosity.</p>
               <p>Frank had no occasion for engaging the services of the hackman, for all he thought
                  of was to reach the nearest Station House. But this was an oversight on the part
                  of our young detective, for the hackman, seeing him emerge from the alley in full
                  rig, immediately suspected that something had gone wrong. Hastening to the
                  "elegant room," he found Magdalena in a towering rage over the miscarriage of her
                  best laid plans.</p>
               <p>But discretion soon got the better of passion, and hastily packing all her most
                  valuable moveables, the hackman conveyed her and them to a safe retreat before
                  they were disturbed by any inquisitive callers.</p>
               <p>On arriving at the Station House, Frank gave the captain, with whom he was
                  acquainted, a brief history of his adventure. The captain listened incredulously,
                  and when Frank had concluded, inquired, in a bantering tone, where he got his
                  whiskey.</p>
               <p>"You don't believe me then," exclaimed Frank, in something like anger.</p>
               <p>"Oh yes," he replied, laughing, "I believe everything—I'm the most believing cuss
                  you ever saw—I believe that the moon is made of green cheese and that you think I
                  have eaten a large slice."</p>
               <p>This sally of wit, at Frank's expense, provoked a laugh among the officers
                  standing about, when he turned away in disgust, to leave the Station and try
                  somewhere else. At the door he encountered his uncle, rushing in so excitedly that
                  he hardly noticed that he ran against his hopeful nephew well slushed from royal
                  oak to cross trees—knocking him half way across the room.</p>
               <p>"Captain," he exclaimed, all out of breath, "I want a squad of men in a hurry!
                  That dare devil nephew of mine has undertaken the office of Detective on his own
                  account, and allowed himself to be decoyed into a house where they may have
                  murdered him by this time."</p>
               <p>He was answered by roars of laughter on all sides. Pointing to Frank the captain
                  replied:</p>
               <p>"There's the young man—here before you—telling me a cock-and-bull story about a
                  shute he has been taking, from a lady's chamber through a greased gutter into a
                  back yard. I'll agree to take the grease part of the story, if somebody will take
                  the balance."</p>
               <p>Turning round, Mr. White looked at his nephew as though he had just risen from the
                  grave, and a greasy grave at that. Frank soon made him acquianted ed with all the
                  particulars, and in turn learned that he had discovered his intimacy with the
                  Southerner, and by setting his detective powers at work, had surmised pretty
                  accurately what his nephew was trying to accomplish. On the night in question he
                  had seen them together, and shortly after happening to meet Davis, he inquired of
                  him what had become of Frank, when he learned that he had gone off with the lady
                  who sent her lovers down a "shute." Davis had followed the pair at a safe
                  distance, noting the streets and saw them enter a house, but he could not tell
                  within half a dozen doors what house it was, he was so far distant at the time.
                  Hence the rush of Mr. White for officers to explore in the neighborhood for his
                  reckless nephew.</p>
               <p>By the time those explanations were made, the captain had a squad of officers
                  ready to go in search of the "shute." The captain was one of those fat,
                  good-natured, square-built men—like the Irishman's stone wall, five feet high and
                  five feet thick, so that if it fell over, it would still be five feet high. He was
                  fond of a joke, and could not forbear perpetrating some at Frank's expense as they
                  went along. He cautioned him not to let the story get out, or he might get she
                  name of being a "slippery" young man.</p>
               <p>On arriving at the house, the violent ring at the door bell was answered, after a
                  short delay, by a chamber window being raised—a night cap thrust out, from whence
                  proceeded, in harsh, feminine tones, a voice which said:</p>
               <p>"Vat's you vant?"</p>
               <p>The officers explained who they were, demanding immediate admittance. After much
                  parleying and grumbling, the night cap disappeared, and soon after the door was
                  opened.</p>
               <p>Young White piloted the way to Magdalena's room, where the furniture was found,
                  just as he had described.</p>
               <p>But the bird had flown.</p>
               <p>The captain, however, was still inclined to doubt the story of the "shute;" but
                  while explaining all the details, Frank managed to get him near enough, so that by
                  a good push, he sent the fat captain fairly upon the trap door and down he
                  went.</p>
               <p>Of course there could be no dispute about Frank's statement after this. An
                  examination of the premises disclosed that the trap-door was hung upon two pivots,
                  one in the center on each side, with a weight underneath, which would cause it to
                  resume its original position the moment the man was tipped off. On the upper
                  surface the carpet was so nicely fitted and joined as to be scarcely perceptible
                  to the eye, even when looking for the boundary lines of the trencher, or
                  trap-door.</p>
               <p>The gutter, or "shute," was made of boards, planed perfectly smooth, and kept well
                  oiled, so that at an angle of thirty degrees, after having once entered it, no man
                  could avoid going to the mouth, which emptied into a back yard, as before
                  described.</p>
               <p>Magdalena had hired the room directly underneath, from the Dutch landlady and by
                  employing a carpenter to do the work with a closed door, no one else was in the
                  secret, until the exposure.</p>
               <p>The wall on the back side of the house being of wood, a small aperture was made,
                  large enough to admit of the passage of a man feet foremost, and then a door
                  fitted in so exactly as not to be noticed. The door being hung upon hinges at the
                  upper side, it would open when the victim's feet came in contact with the lower
                  edge, and after he had made his exit, its own weight would close it before he had
                  time to look up and discover from whence he had been taking a shute.</p>
               <p>These things were discovered, and of course the whole apparatus demolished. But
                  the police failed to get track of<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6970-00000039"/>
                  Magdalena. So she was still left at large, to devise new schemes for adding to her
                  list of victims.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</head>
               <p>The police having obtained a full description of Magdalena, it required the most
                  ingenious disguises, and the utmost care on her part, to escape being
                  arrested.</p>
               <p>Consequently the effect was to somewhat narrow her field of operations, and as she
                  had become addicted to drink, she often found herself without the means of
                  obtaining food when she was hungry.</p>
               <p>About this time she was known among her acquaintances as "Pauline," and in
                  consequence of the cool impudence in appropriating the property of others without
                  rendering any consideration in return, she became an object of dread, even to her
                  best friends.</p>
               <p>We will here relate a few incidents in her career, showing how vice and crime can
                  change a delicate and refined young girl, brought up to consider herself as the
                  heiress of millions. And in order to make the contrast still more striking, we
                  will speak of her by the name she called herself at the time.</p>
               <p>One day Pauline had been wandering about the street with Kate Davenport, a sister
                  in crime, and as night came on, they wanted their suppers. But neither of them had
                  any money, nor was there any prospect of their being able to steal something
                  wherewith to procure the necessary food. At last Pauline became desperate—she was
                  determined to have her supper.</p>
               <p>"Come in, Kate," she said, pulling at the arm of her companion—"I'll show you how
                  to get a supper without money."</p>
               <p>"What on?" queried Kate.</p>
               <p>"On cheek," replied Pauline, earnestly.</p>
               <p>They entered a saloon and took their seats at a table.</p>
               <p>"Two stews, two glasses of ale, and two pieces of lemon pie," ordered Pauline, as
                  airy as though she owned the establishment.</p>
               <p>They were brought by the polite waiter and duly devoured by the famished
                  women.</p>
               <p>"Two more glasses of ale," called out the irrepressible Pauline.</p>
               <p>When these were swallowed, they arose to go out, just as though nothing had
                  happened.</p>
               <p>"Your bill, miss," politely suggested the cashier.</p>
               <p>"My Bill?" demanded Pauline in affected astonishment.</p>
               <p>"Yes, miss, your bill."</p>
               <p>"My Bill went to the war and got shot, poor fellow," whimpered Pauline, pretending
                  to wipe away a tear.</p>
               <p>"You misunderstand me. I mean you have not paid for what you ordered."</p>
               <p>"You don't mean to charge anything for such a little trifle as that?"</p>
               <p>"I certainly do."</p>
               <p>"O, go 'way—go 'way, I say, I've got trouble enough of my own," replied Pauline,
                  as she hurried Kate out of the saloon.</p>
               <p>So Pauline got her supper on "cheek" and this adventure won her the <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">sobriquet</foreign> of "Cheeky Pauline."</p>
               <p>That night when she and Kate went up stairs to dress, Pauline could not find half
                  her things, being scattered about the room every which way.</p>
               <p>"Why don't you get a trunk, and have a place to put your things?" suggested
                  Kate.</p>
               <p>"What! buy a trunk and let a landlady take it for board? No I guess not. Go
                  'way—go 'way, I say—I've got trouble enough of my own."</p>
               <p>These were rough times for Pauline. She was having a streak of hard luck, and but
                  for her "cheek," must have actually suffered, as many a poor wanton does, for
                  clothes to keep her comfortable. In such cases she did not hesitate to confiscate
                  anything that come within her reach—from a bladder of snuff to a velvet cape. It
                  was useless for a girl to expostulate, for Pauline was not to be trifled with, and
                  if her victim persisted, Pauline generally gave her a black eye, with the hint
                  of—"I've trouble enough of my own."</p>
               <p>One more anecdote of Pauline and we must conclude this chapter.</p>
               <p>A hackman called at her boarding house one day, and presented Pauline with a bill
                  for hack hire. It was some time before he could make her understand the nature of
                  his demand, but when she could no longer evade it, striking an attitude, and
                  assuming an air of injured innocence, she opened on him—</p>
               <p>"What! pay that bill! think I'm a fool? No, I guess not—I owe every landlady,
                  every washer woman, and every hackman in New York, and here you come bothering me
                  with that little nasty bill! Go 'way—go 'way, I say—I've got trouble enough of my
                  own."</p>

               <p>Magdalena was soon driven from the home where she was known as "Pauline," and we
                  next find her associated with a low, drunken pickpocket, rejoicing in half a dozen
                  aliases, but whom she called "Jack Spoons." The <choice>
                     <sic>sirname</sic>
                     <corr>surname</corr>
                  </choice> of 'spoons' was given to him in consequence of his having stolen half a
                  dozen pewter spoons, under the impression that they were silver.</p>
               <p>But Jack was so well known to the police that he had but few opportunities for the
                  exercise of his profession, and the result was, that between him and Magdalena,
                  there was but little to choose, so far as procuring the necessaries of life was
                  concerned.</p>
               <p>What they called their home, was in an old building on Oliver street, where half
                  their time was passed in a state of beastly intoxication.</p>
               <p>Magdalena was one day on the street, wondering how she could "make a raise," when
                  she was abruptly addressed by a lady whose manner and appearance indicated that
                  she belonged to respectable society.</p>
               <p>"Well, blurt it out and don't be afraid," retorted Magdalena, as she saw the lady
                  hesitate.</p>
               <p>"My good woman," began the lady timidly, "would you like to earn some money?"</p>
               <p>"Me, earn some money? No, I guess not? Go way—go way, I say, I've got trouble
                  enough of my own."</p>
               <p>The lady took a few steps, as though about to proceed on her way.</p>
               <p>"Hold on—I didn't mean that—its only a way I have of speaking. If you've got a job
                  well put up and will tip handsomely, Mag's your gal."</p>
               <p>"Put up? Tip? I don't understand you, my good woman; but I have something very
                  particular which I want done, and will pay well to any one on whose discretion I
                  can rely."</p>
               <p>"Are you a flat?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know what you mean."</p>
               <p>"That's just what I said to my husband when he told me he was a <emph>gip</emph>
                  and <emph>gonnoff</emph>. But the whiskey is beginning to get out of my head and
                  now I'll talk plain English. But you'd better step into my crib, close by here, in
                  Oliver street, and we can talk the matter over confidentially."</p>
               <p>Leaving them for the concoction of their plans, which will be duly developed in
                  the course of our story, we will make the reader acquainted with Magdalena's
                  strange patron.</p>
               <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6970-00000040"/>
               <p>Nellie Washburn was the daughter of a New England clergyman, but losing both her
                  parents, at the age of sixteen she found herself an orphan, friendless and almost
                  pennyless. Like many a foolish country girl she resolved to go to New York and try
                  her fortune in the great city; her money was all gone before she obtained a
                  situation in a miliner's shop. Her superior education, combined with the freshness
                  of her young beauty, induced Mrs. Lacey, her mistress, to place Nellie behind the
                  counter, where she soon became a great favorite with the customers.</p>
               <p>Chief among the patrons of Mrs. Lacey, was a Fifth Avenue heiress, Miss Angeline
                  Rich, who was betrothed to a gentleman by the name of Hector Montenado, whose
                  father was a wealthy planter in Havana.</p>
               <p>The mother of Angeline was a widow moving in the most aristocratic circles, and
                  duly proud of the man she expected to become her son-in-law.</p>
               <p>Some three months before the time agreed upon for her marriage with Hector, he
                  called one day just as Angeline and her mother was going out to purchase their
                  summer bonnets, and on their invitation accompanied them. The fashionable shop of
                  Mrs. Lacey was their point of destination, and here for the first time, Hector met
                  with Nellie Washburn.</p>
               <p>Of course he was struck with her beauty, and vowed to win her. He called
                  frequently during the next ten days, upon various pretexts, and so won upon the
                  confidence of Nellie, that she consented to accompany him to the theatre. Hector
                  treated her with the utmost respect—being careful not to offend her delicacy in
                  any manner—and the simple-minded country girl was silly enough to believe that his
                  intentions were honorable.</p>
               <p>Following up his game, he soon became satisfied that her love was not to be
                  bought, and still concealing his real designs, he one day asked her to become his
                  wife. Proud of his love, and grateful for his condescension, she consented.</p>
               <p>His next step was to remove her from the shop, and having found "a respectable
                  widow who was not inquisitive," he had Nellie removed there as a boarder, until
                  such time as they could get ready for marriage.</p>
               <p>Hector supplied her with costly dresses, a gold watch and diamond ring, and all in
                  such a delicate manner that Nellie never dreamed of the black-hearted villainy
                  which he concealed beneath his polished exterior.</p>
               <p>It is the old story, and the reader can imagine the result of Hector's
                  acquaintance with Nellie.</p>
               <p>Thus the time flew by on golden wings, until a week before Hector was to lead to
                  the altar the beautiful heiress, Miss Angeline Rich. Then he must for a time get
                  rid of Nellie, although still anxious to retain her as his mistress. But how to
                  break the subject to her, was a question that puzzled him.</p>
               <p>In this dilemma he appealed to Mrs. Grow, the "respectable widow," who acted as
                  go-between for him. Very politely, very gracefully—the widow told Nellie of
                  Hector's intended marriage with Miss Rich, but assured the weeping girl that
                  Hector would act the gentleman—would still supply all her wants, and on his return
                  from his wedding tour, would come to see her and be just as affectionate as ever.
                  With these comforting consolations, the widow who was "not inquisitive," wished
                  Nellie a pleasant "good-day," and left the poor girl alone with her despair.</p>
               <p>The strongest excitements always exhaust themselves the soonest. Thus it was with
                  Nellie. When her weeping subsided, a desperate calm came over her. She reflected.
                  However much she might have been at fault, she felt that Hector was a thousand
                  times more to blame. She could then perceive that his whole course of conduct had
                  been to seduce, ruin, and then desert her. Her Puritanic wrath was aroused. From
                  loving she now hated him with all the intensity of her intense nature. Then came
                  the thought of revenge, and revenge she vowed to have. But to accomplish her
                  purpose with certainty, she must imitate the hypocrisy of Hector, and conceal her
                  real feelings.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, when he called in the evening, she said to him—</p>
               <p>"So you do not intend to marry me, Hector?"</p>
               <p>"Indeed I never had such a thought, Nellie."</p>
               <p>"Then why did you promise?"</p>
               <p>"Because you was so stubborn—had such Puritanic notions about virtue, that I could
                  not succeed without."</p>
               <p>"And is it true that you intend marrying Miss Rich?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, the wedding is fixed for this day week. I feel sorry for your
                  disappointment, Nellie, and have been dreading to tell you for some time. But now
                  it is out, I hope you will not get up a scene, for you know I hate scenes."</p>
               <p>"Do you think it was honorable, Hector, thus to deceive a poor orphan who put all
                  her trust in you?"</p>
               <p>"As for the deception, it is no more than what all men practice, and you will soon
                  forget about your disappointment. Besides, I do not intend to desert you—we can
                  still remain just as good friends as ever."</p>
               <p>"But who would marry me now?"</p>
               <p>"O, bother! I don't like being teased with so many questions. Never fret about
                  trouble till it comes, and always let the future take care of itself, is my
                  motto."</p>
               <p>A choking sob rose to Nellie's throat, but she resolutely swallowed it back,
                  answering calmly—</p>
               <p>"I have never wanted to tease you Hector, and you must try and bear with me a
                  little now, for I feel very sad."</p>
               <p>Hector put his arm around her waist in the same loving manner as of old. But he
                  felt no answering thrill—no nestling towards him. Cold and passive as a corpse,
                  she neither encouraged nor repelled his familiarity. Chilled by her want of
                  passion, his own soon cooled, and without enjoying himself as he had expected, he
                  soon bade her good night and withdrew, leaving her sitting alone in her room, as
                  immovable as a statue.</p>
               <p>Daylight next morning found her still sitting there. No sleep came to her eyes—no
                  slumber to her eyelids. She was meditating upon revenge.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Grow was very kind—came early to her room, and when she could not prevail
                  upon Nellie to go down to breakfast, brought her some toast and coffee.</p>
               <p>Midday came. Nellie still sat there—the toast and coffee untasted. She was still
                  thinking.</p>
               <p>The clock struck four that afternoon, and then Nellie sprang to her feet, as
                  though just awaking from a trance. Hurriedly she drew on her bonnet and shawl, and
                  in a few minutes issued from the house.</p>
               <p>There was but little hesitation in her manner, and she appeared like one whose
                  plans had been well matured. All she needed was a confederate, and chance threw
                  her in the way of Magdalena, who was, as usual, under the influence of liquor. But
                  when Magdalena learned that there was an opportunity to make some money, she
                  aroused herself and prepared for action.</p>
               <p>Whatever the arrangement made between Nellie and Magdalena might have been, they
                  appeared mutually satisfied and pleased with each other,</p>
               <p>"Now be faithful," added Nellie, in conclusion, "keep sober—do your work well, and
                  when completed, fifty dollars shall be your reward."</p>
               <p>"Yes, miss," replied the outcast, in a servile tone, as she fawned before the
                  betrayed girl, thinking how much purer<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6970-00000041"/> er
                  and better Nellie was than herself; "Yes, I will only take a drop, just to steady
                  my nerves, and will come at the time you have appointed.</p>
               <p>Poor Magdalena! So lost and abandoned that she looks up as to a superior to poor
                  Nellie. And yet had these two chanced to have met when Magdalena was living in the
                  Van Linden mansion, with what scorn the proud heiress would have regarded the
                  humble shop girl, even though Nellie had been as pure as an angel.</p>
               <p>But now, although Nellie has taken the first step in shame, from which a woman
                  seldom recovers, yet the trappings of decency are still about her—she has not yet
                  begun to sink in the sloughs of degradation, and poor Magdalena actually envies
                  her the exalted position she enjoys.</p>
               <p>But could we peer into the future for only three short years, we might there find
                  Nellie sunk to a level with where Magdalena now stands, with Magdalena still in
                  advance, exploring those lower deeps of infamy, which, like the pit spoken of by
                  John the Revelator, was bottomless.</p>
               <p>On her way home, Nellie made three calls—each time at a drug store, and each time
                  procuring a small quantity of the same drug. One of these quantities would have
                  been harmless—the three together would operate more powerfully.</p>
               <p>Arrived home, she informed Mrs. Grow that she expected a laundress to call in the
                  course of the evening, and desired that she might be conducted to her room.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XL.</head>
               <p>Evening came, and at eight o'clock Hector made his appearance, according to
                  arrangement the night previous.</p>
               <p>Nellie received him with her old smile and kiss, appearing as though all had been
                  forgotten and forgiven.</p>
               <p>"Bless you, Nellie," he said, "you are your own sweet self again. That is right—I
                  like to see you smile—sunshine is so much more agreeable than gloomy clouds."</p>
               <p>"O, yes," she replied, "I am not one to mope over a disappointment."</p>
               <p>"Right again, my darling, and as this is the last night we are to spend together
                  for some time to come, let us be happy while we can."</p>
               <p>"That is just what I thought, Hector, and perhaps a bottle of wine would not tend
                  to inspire us with gloom."</p>
               <p>"Good—ring the bell, Nellie, and order whatever you like."</p>
               <p>Lightly as a fawn, Nellie glided to the bell-pull, and on the appearance of Mrs.
                  Grow, requested her to send up a bottle of wine, with ice and glasses, and a plate
                  of cake.</p>
               <p>In a few moments a servant entered, bringing a waiter, on which were the
                  refreshments which Nellie had ordered.</p>
               <p>"You may draw the cork," said Nellie to the servant, "and then retire."</p>
               <p>The girl obeyed, leaving the betrayer and betrayed once more alone together.</p>
               <p>"Allow me to do the honors, Hector, and wait upon you myself."</p>
               <p>"Certainly, my dear, everything will have a higher relish from having passed
                  through your fair hands."</p>
               <p>Standing with her back towards Hector, she proceeded to fill the glasses, and he
                  did not observe that she adroitly deposited in his glass a mixture which she had
                  previously made by dissolving the three quantities of that drug which she had
                  purchased, as before mentioned.</p>
               <p>"Success to our future undertakings," exclaimed Nellie, as they stood with their
                  glasses in hand.</p>
               <p>"And confusion to our foes," responded Hector, as they both drained off the
                  contents.</p>
               <p>Nellie had taken so much pains to ice the wine, and Hector had swallowed it so
                  suddenly, that he did not detect any peculiar taste to it until upon removing the
                  glass from his lips, when he said—</p>
               <p>"It seems as though this wine has a bitter flavor."</p>
               <p>"I did not notice it," replied Nellie, "but here," she continued, refilling his
                  glass, "try some more."</p>
               <p>Hector tasted and sipped—sipped and tasted. But he finally concluded that he had
                  been mistaken, and so that glass washed down all the bitter of the first.</p>
               <p>For nearly half an hour they sat, nibbling at the cake, sipping the wine and
                  chatting in the most affectionate manner.</p>
               <p>Then Hector complained of a strange yet delightful sensation in his head.
                  Fantastic visions were floating before his eyes, in which he beheld beautiful
                  landscapes, crowded with flowers of strange loveliness. Birds of richest plumage
                  were twittering their loves, while seraph wings seemed to fan his heated brow.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="i"/>hasheesh was beginning to operate.</p>
               <p>"Brandy, my divine Venus—give me brandy," he exclaimed, in the enthusiasm of his
                  exhileration.</p>
               <p>Nellie rang the bell and ordered a bottle of "golden seal," but administered it
                  cautiously, for it was not her object to reduce him to a state of perfect
                  unconsciousness.</p>
               <p>"O, bright star of my destiny," said Hector, embracing Nellie in a most
                  extravagant manner—"O thou brilliant sun in the centre of my sublunary happiness,
                  around which revolve all my rapturous delights—thou goddess of beauty and
                  love—thou—thou—"</p>
               <p>He was interrupted by a knock upon the door, and an announcement from Mrs. Grow
                  that Mrs. Smith had called to see Miss Washburn.</p>
               <p>"Have her come right up—I am all ready for her," replied Nellie, with a strange
                  fire flashing in her eyes.</p>
               <p>The next moment Magdalena entered the room. A glance of intelligence passed
                  between her and Nellie, whereby each felt assured that there was no
                  misunderstanding.</p>
               <p>"Take a seat, Mrs. Smith," said Nellie, "and I shall not keep you waiting but a
                  few moments."</p>
               <p>Magdalena fell languidly into the chair indicated, her eyes fixed all the time on
                  the bottles and glasses. Poor thing! She was perfectly sober—she had mustered
                  resolution to keep so in order to earn the fifty dollars, but such a slave had she
                  become to the debasing appetite, that even for the fifty dollars she could not
                  have refrained from becoming intoxicated, when so temptingly displayed before her
                  eyes, had she been left to herself.</p>
               <p>But finding it only an aggravation to look and not taste, Magdalena turned her
                  dull eyes upon Hector.</p>
               <p>But look! Her eyes, late so heavy, now flash with strange brilliancy. Her bosom
                  swells and falls as though breathing was painful. There is no languor in her
                  appearence now, but like a wolf, she seems ready to spring upon and devour her
                  prey.</p>
               <p>What had caused this strange, wild excitement? She was still looking at Hector,
                  who did not heed even her presence, so completely was he under the spell of <hi
                     rend="i"/>hasheesh and alcohol.</p>
               <p>But to Magdalena he was not Hector. The man she saw before her was her
                  husband!</p>
               <p>Yes, it was the villain Desmondo, in a new character, yet so similar to the one he
                  played while acting as her music teacher, that she had no difficulty in
                  recognizing him.</p>
               <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6970-00000042"/>
               <p>Nellie observed the sudden change in the manner of the outcast, but imputed it to
                  the effects of drinking.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Smith," said Nellie, anxious to arouse her, and fearful that the outcast was
                  in danger of falling into a spasm, "where did you say you were living now?"</p>
               <p>Recalled to a consciousness of the necessity for present action, in order to earn
                  the promised reward, Magdalena mastered her emotions and replied calmly—</p>
               <p>"I have broken up housekeeping and to-day went to live with Mrs. Rich, on Fifth
                  Avenue."</p>
               <p>Hector, as we will still continue to call Desmondo, was not so far lost to
                  consciousness as not to notice the mention of his expected mother-in-law's name,
                  which he manifested by turning his eyes full upon the poor outcast, whose ruin he
                  had caused.</p>
               <p>But in vain might he have looked to trace a resemblance in the blear-eyed, bloated
                  outcast before him, to the delicate and refined Magdalena, the heiress of
                  millions.</p>
               <p>One look, and then with an exclamation of disgust, he turned his eyes away from
                  the woman who was still his lawful wife.</p>
               <p>Magdalena had fully recovered her self-possession by this time, for well she knew
                  the frightful change which had taken place in her appearance, and was under no
                  apprehension of being recognized.</p>
               <p>She still had her part to play. It was at first undertaken for money, but now she
                  was swayed forward by a stronger feeling—<emph>revenge!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Rising to her feet, and speaking naturally, she turned to Nellie and said—</p>
               <p>"I am glad to see you, Miss Nellie, but I can't stop a minute, for Miss Angeline
                  sent me in such a hurry to find Mr. Montenado, for her mother, Mrs. Rich, fell
                  down stairs and broke her arm, and Miss Angeline says she shall die if Hector
                  don't come, and I am going to the Astor House to look for him. But I shouldn't
                  know him, and I don't know what to do."</p>
               <p>"Distressed female," said Hector, as though lord of the universe, "in me you
                  behold that distinguished personage, Hector Montenado, at your service."</p>
               <p>"O, sir, then please come, for Miss Angeline is fretting so much."</p>
               <p>"Angeline is but another name for angel, and from my beautiful Venus I fly to my
                  angel."</p>
               <p>"A little more brandy, Hector," said Nellie, in an insinuating tone, "it will
                  quiet your nerves."</p>
               <p>"Right, my adored, and this distressed female shall drink to the success of a
                  broken arm, wishing it had been her neck."</p>
               <p>Nellie poured out for both, calculating to a nicety just how much each
                  required.</p>
               <p>"Ah, thou distressed and voluptuous female," said Hector, setting down the glass,
                  "didst thou ever partake of forbidden fruit? Knowest thou the joys of a Venus
                  embracing her Cupid—while all the time delicious nectar drops from their divine
                  lips?"</p>
               <p>"A little—only a very little," simpered Magdalena, with affected modesty.</p>
               <p>"Then thou art a jewel—I'll win and wear thee."</p>
               <p>Hector seems to have undergone a very sudden change in his feelings towards the
                  outcast. But this resulted from the fact of her being the bearer of good news—Mrs.
                  Rich had fallen and hurt herself very severely—perhaps she might die of her
                  injuries, and then he would be in full <choice>
                     <sic>posession</sic>
                     <corr>possession</corr>
                  </choice> of both the heiress and her property.</p>
               <p>He retained sense enough to realize this fact, but like a drunken man, had not wit
                  enough to keep it to himself.</p>
               <p>His next move was to catch the outcast in his arms, little dreaming that she was
                  his wife, and embrace her in a most affectionate manner.</p>
               <p>This part of the performance not being in the programme agreed upon by the two
                  plotters, Magdalena looked to Nellie for instructions. A triumphant smile and nod
                  in the affirmative, assured Magdalena that all was going on well.</p>
               <p>So pleased was Hector with the outcast, that he could not be persuaded to start on
                  the errand planned for him, until she promised to return and listen to his
                  protestations of love and adoration. The liquor and <hi rend="i"/>hasheesh had
                  made a fool of him.</p>
               <p>With this understanding, to which Nellie readily agreed, Hector finally set off in
                  company with his wife, to call upon his betrothed.</p>
               <p>By the time they had reached the residence of Mrs. Rich, a gleam of returning
                  reason induced Hector to suggest that Magdalena should remain outside and wait for
                  him.</p>
               <p>But that would have destroyed the whole plan of operations, and she would not
                  consent.</p>
               <p>Believing that she was a servant in the house, and had been sent for him, there
                  did not seem any impropriety in her returning in his company, and he at last
                  agreed that she might have her own way.</p>
               <p>"It will be better, then," she suggested, "as you are a little light-headed, for
                  you to take my arm, which will prevent you from staggering."</p>
               <p>"Most amiable of women," he replied, going off into ecstacies again, "the thought
                  is worthy of a wiser head. Be thou my stay and support, and when the glorious day
                  of my triumph shall arrive, ask me for a what thou wilt and I will not deny
                  thee."</p>
               <p>Leaning heavily upon her arm, with his legs performing segments of circles as he
                  advanced them, they presented themselves at the door and rang the bell.</p>
               <p>The servant who answered the bell, hesitated at first about admitting Hector and
                  the outcast, for she readily comprehended that the lover of Miss Angeline was in
                  an excellent condition for disgusting the household.</p>
               <p>But upon second thought, as she never liked the lordly airs of the villian, she
                  was rejoiced at the opportunity afforded for bringing about discord.</p>
               <p>So, with mock humility, she conducted them to the parlor, where were seated Mrs.
                  Rich, her daughter, and some half a dozen select friends, where she gave all a
                  shock by the strange announcement—</p>
               <p>"Monsieur Montenado and a <emph>person</emph>!"</p>
               <p>"Good evening, Hector," said Angeline, with evident embarrassment, which she tried
                  in vain to conceal, as she advanced to meet him, having scarcely noticed the
                  outcast.</p>
               <p>"Angel of glory—fairy—peri, and seraph, allow me to embrace you," shouted Hector,
                  extending his arms.</p>
               <p>Miss Rich started back in amazement. "Why Hector," she exclaimed, "are you
                  insane?"</p>
               <p>"With love," he replied, "only with love does reason wander."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Montenado," began Mrs. Rich, in all her aristocratic dignity, "what means
                  this strange conduct, and who is this person with whom you have presumed to
                  contaminate my house?"</p>
               <p>Hector was partially aroused to his senses by this speech, and had he been
                  stupified only by <choice>
                     <sic>alchohol</sic>
                     <corr>alcohol</corr>
                  </choice>, would no doubt have been sobered. But the <choice>
                     <sic>insidous</sic>
                     <corr>insidious</corr>
                  </choice> influence of hasheesh, so stimulating to the brain, and intoxicating to
                  the senses, could not be so easily thrown off. Before Hector could frame a reply
                  to the proud matron, the outcast came to the rescue, saying—</p>
               <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6970-00000043"/>
               <p>"I am not a person, madam, but Hector's woman, and he is going home with me, ain't
                  you, Hector?"</p>
               <p>Again he yielded to the influence of the intoxicating drug, and striking an
                  attitude he had learned from some third class actor, he staggered forward,
                  throwing his arms about the neck of his wife, as he replied—</p>
               <p>"Sweet emblem of divinity, the dew of whose lips is more delicious than the fabled
                  drink of Jove, the god of gods and men—as the poets of old on the winged horse
                  Pegassus, quaffed at the Hellespont, so I to thee—thou celestial cream pitcher,"
                  and suiting the action to the word he almost stifled the outcast with kisses.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Rich and her daughter both screamed, and nearly fainted with mortification.
                  The servants rushed in, and amid the confusion that followed, Magdalena managed to
                  get Hector out of the room and out of the house, he having entirely forgotten in
                  the delirium of his rapture, the object of his visit.</p>
               <p>Having faithfully performed her part of the contract with Nellie, Magdalena would
                  now have been entitled to the promised fifty dollars, had she been disposed to
                  return and claim it.</p>
               <p>But she believed she could do better by passing the night with her husband.
                  Besides, having assisted Nellie in her revenge, she had a small account of her own
                  to settle.</p>
               <p>Magdalena had not seen her husband since the fatal night when he drugged and
                  transfered her to another. No wonder, then, as she recalled the years of sin and
                  suffering with which her young life had been cursed by the villain, that she
                  burned for revenge.</p>
               <p>In his insane condition, she experienced no difficulty in persuading him to
                  accompany her to the wretched den, on Oliver street, which she called her
                  home.</p>

               <p>"Hullo, Mag, caught a flat?" exclaimed Jack Spoons, as she came in half dragging
                  Hector after her.</p>
               <p>"Hush up, and fix the bed, for the poor gentleman is tired, arn't you,
                  Hector?"</p>
               <p>But the reaction from the <hi rend="i"/>hasheesh had commenced, and Hector was too
                  stupid to reply.</p>
               <p>Jack and the outcast tumbled Desmondo on to the bed as though he had been an
                  inanimate clod, where he soon fell into a sound sleep.</p>
               <p>Then the two held a long conference, wherein Magdalena revealed the relation she
                  bore to Desmondo, and swore with a bitter oath that see would be revenged.</p>
               <p>Jack readily entered into all her plans, because he knew that the "swag" would be
                  divided in such a manner that he would get the lion's share.</p>
               <p>Too impatient to ascertain how much booty they would realize from their victim,
                  they could not wait to mature all their schemes of vengeance, but proceeded to
                  take an inventory of his pockets and wearing apparel.</p>
               <p>It was not very professional, thus to rob a brother thief, yet it is often
                  practised in spite of the old proverb—"honor among thieves."</p>
               <p>They found concealed about the person of Desmondo, no less than three thousand
                  dollars, exclusive of a valuable gold watch, diamond pin, ring, bosom studs and
                  sleeve buttons.</p>
               <p>These they divided by Jack taking two thousand dollars of the money, leaving the
                  rest, including every stitch of his clothing, to Magdalena.</p>
               <p>Then they dressed the aristocratic Desmondo in the meanest rags—gagged and bound
                  him securely.</p>
               <p>Sleep on Desmondo—sleep off the exhilerating effects of the <hi rend="i"/>hasheesh and<choice>
                     <sic>acohol</sic>
                     <corr>alcohol</corr>
                  </choice>—but thief and vagabond that you are, it is your last refreshing
                  slumber.</p>
               <p>But do not the ghosts of your victims come trooping about your wretched couch,
                  distorting your imagination with horrid visions?</p>
               <p>Are you not like Richard III. when that ghostly throng haunted his slumber on the
                  eve of his great battle, <choice>
                     <sic>wherin</sic>
                     <corr>wherein</corr>
                  </choice> he was destined to be overcome by Richmond?</p>
               <p>Verily, Desmondo, a more bitter foe than Richmond, or even the blood-thirsty
                  Richard, now has you in her power. And she has been made this fiend in human
                  shape, Desmondo, by your own perfidy. Therefore it is mete that your turn should
                  come—that you should reap as you have sown, and writhe under the instrument of
                  torture you have made of the <emph>Outcast</emph>.</p>
               <p>Jack and Magdalena, having secured their stolen property, or "swag," as they
                  termed it, now set seriously to work to dispose of their victim, the wretched
                  Desmondo.</p>
               <p>There was a small, unoccupied cellar beneath the premises, and whither they
                  resolved to convey him before he should awake. Once there, Jack was to resign the
                  captive entirely to the tender mercies of Magdalena, and it was further agreed
                  that the two should then separate for a time, so as to lessen the chances of both
                  being arrested.</p>
               <p>It was nearly morning when they bore the unconscious form of Desmondo to the dark
                  dungeon and laid him on some filthy straw.</p>
               <p>Jack then secured the door by means of a rusty padlock, and giving the key to
                  Magdalena, hurriedly left the house.</p>
               <p>We may as well explain here, that Jack proceeded to Boston by the first train,
                  where he dressed himself in the height of fashion, and for several days really
                  enjoyed himself.</p>
               <p>But next to stealing, gambling was his besetting sin. He could not refrain from
                  visiting faro rooms, and with a "fat roll" in his pocket, could not resist the
                  temptation to buy a "stack of chips."</p>
               <p>Heretofore he had been a "piker" that is, a small player; but now, with a "bunch
                  of red bones," and a "front seat," he felt himself of some consequence.</p>
               <p>It is not necessary to enter into an account of the details of his varied success.
                  It was only a question of time when he must take a "back seat," and go away "dead
                  broke."</p>
               <p>That time came at last, and like all on whom the mania for gambling has fastened,
                  he "went plumb through." Then, to retrieve his losses, everything that he could
                  spare was "played in" as "collateral," even to his coat.</p>
               <p>Driven to the wall, his last resource was stealing.</p>
               <p>Fortunately for the public, he was caught—convicted of grand larceny, and some one
                  having recognized him as an old offender, was sentenced to Charleston State prison
                  for ten years, where he is still serving the country, far more acceptably than it
                  is possible for him to do in any other capacity. There we will leave him and
                  return to the outcast and her prisoner, the villainous Desmondo.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XLII.</head>
               <p>Morning found Magdalena comparatively calm, considering the exciting scenes
                  through which she had passed during the night. But almost total abstinence from
                  drink, during that time, left her nerves in a condition denominated "shaky;" and
                  her debased appetite was loudly calling for its accustomed stimulant.</p>
               <p>Descending to her prisoner, she cautiously peered into his dungeon. He still
                  slept.</p>
               <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6970-00000044"/>
               <p>"Ah, Desmondo," she muttered, between her clenched teeth, "your career of infamy
                  has reached its crisis. Like the wicked you have flourished well for a season, but
                  now your hour of retribution has come."</p>
               <p>Silently closing and locking the door, she hurried back to her room.</p>
               <p>"Let me see," she continued, still musing, "I will keep him there as long as he
                  lives, and his life shall be a continued torture. I will even prolong that life
                  that my vengeance may be fully glutted. He shall live upon bread and water,
                  sleeping upon that straw, until vermin shall cover him from head to foot. I have
                  the money—his own ill-gotten money—which will enable me to carry out my plans and
                  avoid detection. Yes, I will hire the whole house—get rid of the present tenants,
                  and then, Desmondo, my beloved husband, we will enjoy our married life without let
                  or hindrance."</p>
               <p>Acting upon this resolution, she sought an interview with the landlord—paid him
                  three months rent in advance—bribed the wretched tenants to vacate, under the
                  pretence that she was about to open a boarding house, and in forty-eight hours
                  from the time of adopting this resolution, she and Desmondo had the house to
                  themselves.</p>
               <p>Then, and not till then, did she venture to remove the gag from his mouth. But
                  little sustenance, and that only in a fluid form, had he been able to take during
                  the time, and now he showed signs of great weakness and prostration.</p>
               <p>The outcast had made herself known to him at their first interview, on his
                  awakening from the deep sleep of that memorable night. Yet he would not believe
                  for a long time that the bloated disgusting wreck of womanhood before him, and
                  Magdalena Linden Van Linden, were one and the same person.</p>
               <p>But so minutely did she detail to him every circumstance of their acquaintance,
                  that he was at last forced to admit the truth of her statement.</p>
               <p>Heretofore he had been the master and she the slave. Now the conditions were
                  reversed, and it was his turn to implore. She informed him precisely of the course
                  she had adopted, before removing the gag, and then, with a small bar of iron in
                  her hand, assured him that upon his making the least outcry, she would "tap him on
                  the head" and at once restore the gag.</p>
               <p>Poor Desmondo! He had run his race. He had escaped a thousand dangers, and from
                  his long career of crime, he had begun to flatter himself that he should get
                  through life with impunity. But now he was taking his first lesson in that old
                  proverb—a lesson which all such must learn, sooner or later—that "the way of the
                  transgressor is hard."</p>
               <p>In vain he plead and begged for mercy. Mercy! Was not that divine emotion crushed
                  from her very soul? and was not he the cause thereof? As well ask mercy of a
                  raving maniac, as of the woman whom man has basely betrayed.</p>
               <p>A week went by. Magdalena spent hours each day in the dungeon with her prisoner,
                  contriving every species of mental torture which malice could invent, until from
                  his physical as well as mental sufferings, his brain began to reel, and she seemed
                  to him more like a fiend from hot Tartarus than a human being.</p>
               <p>She left him one day, after having fairly eclipsed her former attempts at torture,
                  promising to come back and spend the night with him.</p>
               <p>Night! alas, it was always night—always darkness—except when she was there with a
                  dim light, shed from a tallow dip, so that he knew no difference between day and
                  night.</p>
               <p>Utterly exhausted, Desmondo fell into a heavy slumber. Hours went by and then he
                  awoke.</p>
               <p>But he was still alone in the surrounding rounding gloom and with his still more
                  gloomy thoughts.</p>
               <p>Two days elapsed, and still his jailor came not.</p>
               <p>But scantily fed heretofore, and upon the meanest diet, he was in no condition to
                  endure a long fast. As usual whenever she left him, the gag was restored, while
                  the chords which bound his wrists had worn away the skin, and were now
                  frictionizing the raw flesh.</p>
               <p>Hunger and intolerable thirst were now consuming him, but still no Magdalena.</p>
               <p>O, it was a terrible death to die—to die of starvation—and yet powerless to help
                  himself or implore the help of others.</p>
               <p>We will not weary nor shock the reader with the horrible details of Desmondo's
                  dying agonies. Even Magdalena herself must have relented in her cruelty could she
                  have witnessed them.</p>
               <p>For a whole week he languished, a prey to the bitterest remorse of which the human
                  mind is susceptible, and then death relieved him from his sufferings.</p>
               <p>Thus perished—miserably perished—a man whose power of intellect, had it been
                  directed in the right channels, might have made him distinguished among the great
                  and good of the nation.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XLIII.</head>
               <p>And what has become of the outcast?</p>
               <p>When she left Desmondo for the last time, it was far from her intention to abandon
                  him to so speedy a death. She wanted him to live—to live for years—that she might
                  gloat upon his sufferings and mock him in the bitterness of his agony.</p>
               <p>But on the street she encountered an old <choice>
                     <sic>aquaintance</sic>
                     <corr>acquaintance</corr>
                  </choice> by the name of Swartwin. This man had been a villain from birth, but by
                  superior tact had been enabled thus far to pass as a respectable citizen. He had
                  held several important offices under the general government, but recently his
                  stealings—politely termed "defalcations—" had awakened suspicion, and now, with
                  several thousand dollars of government money in his pocket, he had escaped from
                  Washington, intending to take a steamer for Europe.</p>
               <p>But there had been a detention of the train from Philadelphia, in consequence of
                  an accident upon the road, whereby he failed to arrive in season for the steamer.
                  So she sailed without him.</p>
               <p>Having discovered symptoms that the detectives of New York were upon his track, he
                  dared not remain in the city, and was meditating making his escape by the way of
                  the Hudson River Railroad.</p>
               <p>When he met Magdalena, he was just returning from a last visit to Mattie Wood, the
                  daughter of a poor, but respectable mechanic. Under a promise of marriage, he had
                  betrayed Mattie, and now was about to abandon her forever.</p>
               <p>Relying upon the strength of her love, he had even told her of his peculations,
                  and the course he should take in leaving the city.</p>
               <p>He had known Magdalena in her better days—knew her secret history, and of her
                  marriage with Desmondo—without knowing to what depths in degradation she had sunk
                  of late.</p>
               <p>There had been a time when the outcast held herself above him, and that
                  recollection, no doubt, induced him to cherish a desire for her society in the
                  exile to which he was hastening.</p>
               <p>On the impulse of the moment, he stopped—made himself known to her, and asked her
                  to fly the country with him.</p>
               <p>Magdalena had scarcely tasted of intoxicating liquor for a week, until on<pb
                     n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6970-00000045"/> this particular day, and now she was
                  partially under its influence.</p>
               <p>Forgetful for the moment of Desmondo, she consented to his request without the
                  least reflection.</p>
               <p>In half an hour afterwards she was seated beside Swartwin in the car, and being
                  rapidly whirled away in the direction of Albany.</p>
               <p>The soothing motion of the car, added to the stupefying influence of the liquor
                  which she had drank, soon put her fast asleep.</p>
               <p>Heavily her head fell over upon the shoulder of her companion, and as such a
                  position would naturally lead to the supposition that they were husband and wife,
                  thereby diverting suspicion from himself, he concealed her face and his own as
                  well as he could, and pretended to fall asleep himself.</p>
               <p>At Albany, when they left the cars to take the ferry boat, she awoke with a
                  burning thirst, not only for water, but more of the intoxicating beverage.</p>
               <p>Swartwin drew out his brandy flask and held it to her lips. Google, google,
                  google! Down went nearly half a pint, and by the time they reached the cars upon
                  the other side of the river, she was so drunk she could scarcely stand.</p>
               <p>Of course she never thought of Desmondo, and every moment was widening the
                  distance between them.</p>
               <p>They changed cars again at Buffalo, and here an incident transpired which served
                  still to keep her mind diverted from her husband.</p>
               <p>On the platform, as they were leaving the train, Swartwin encountered Mattie
                  Wood.</p>
               <p>Mattie, having learned from him his destination, had hurriedly arrayed herself in
                  whatever came to hand, resolving to go with him, whatever might be the
                  consequence. She saw him at the depot with Magdalena in charge, and supposing that
                  the outcast was only going a short distance, bought her own ticket with the money
                  he had given her, and took the same train.</p>
               <p>But not knowing the direction he intended taking from Buffalo, Mattie concluded to
                  make herself known and declare her intention of following his destiny, be it what
                  it might.</p>
               <p>Here was a fix. Swartwin dared not deny her, lest she might denounce him, and
                  making the best arrangement with the two that he could, by lying to both, it was
                  finally arranged that they should proceed on the journey in company.</p>
               <p>As a matter of course, both women became jealous, and soon began to hate each
                  other.</p>
               <p>Leaving them for the present, we will return again to the city.</p>

               <p>A dispatch from Washington had put the detectives of New-York upon the alert, and
                  by some mysterious process, known only to the initiated, they had struck the trail
                  of the fugitive, and John Clure, a young detective, was despatched to follow it
                  up.</p>
               <p>Diligently the officer tracked the defaulter to Cincinnati, and after several days
                  finally traced him, with his two women, to a steamer bound for New Orleans, and
                  thither he followed.</p>
               <p>Clure arrived in the Crescent City in the midst of the sickly season, and was
                  there but a few days before he was attacked with the yellow fever. But his
                  temperate habits afforded a poor support for the disease to prey upon, and in a
                  short time he was able to leave his room.</p>
               <p>But he did not venture out of doors during the heat of the day, for in his
                  debilitated condition, the almost perpendicular rays of the sun were overpowering.
                  But in the evening he would call a carriage and take a drive through the city,
                  trying by accident more than any settled plan to obtain some clue to the
                  fugitive.</p>
               <p>On the third evening, after having ridden out to that portion of the city occupied
                  mostly by residences, Clure concluded to dismiss the carriage and take a stroll on
                  foot. It was still early—not later than nine—when feeling himself quite weary, he
                  paused on the corner of two streets, intending to hail the first carriage that
                  passed, and return to his hotel.</p>
               <p>While standing there, his attention was arrested by the approach of a lady, in
                  whose manner he at once detected something peculiar. She was genteelly dressed,
                  though not in the extreme of fashion, and bore evidence of being respectable. But
                  there was a nervousness in her step which seemed unnatural, and he observed that
                  she kept casting hurried glances in every direction.</p>
               <p>She paused when near him, and hurriedly enquired the direction to a street from
                  which she was just coming, distant but a single square. This he explained to her,
                  when she apologised by saying that she was so confused from having been grossly
                  insulted by a man a few minutes before, that she really did not know where she
                  was.</p>
               <p>During this brief dialogue, Clure had been examining her rather critically and
                  became assured that she was laboring under a great excitement of some kind, and
                  that probably she had told the truth. The result of these conclusions was what
                  nine men out of ten would have done under the circumstances—namely, an offer on
                  his part to guide her where she desired to go. He felt weary, and thinking he
                  could walk easier by a partial support from her, offered his arm, which she
                  accepted.</p>
               <p>Clure noticed that she was trembling slightly, and having made up his mind that
                  she was an honest woman, it was natural that he should construe her nervousness
                  favorably, imputing it to the cause she had given.</p>
               <p>The detective could not help observing that there was something very peculiar in
                  the appearance of the woman, which even her agitation and excitement would not
                  account for. He tried to draw her into conversation, as they walked along, but her
                  mind seemed entirely preoccupied, and she answered his questions without
                  comprehending their import.</p>
               <p>Yet her language indicated that she was a lady of education, and this, coupled
                  with the fact that her mind was in such a condition of abstraction, assured him
                  the more that she was respectable, for his experience with criminals had taught
                  him that they were seldom or never absent-minded.</p>
               <p>Still he could not drive back a presentiment that there was something wrong about
                  the woman. Hence he resolved to watch her narrowly, while at the same time he
                  treated her as a lady.</p>
               <p>They proceeded along very leisurely, down the street she had inquired about, and
                  in a few moments she paused at the door of a small, two-story house. Here he
                  expected to part company with her, but she was so nervous—expressed so much fear
                  that the man who had insulted her might have watched her home—saying that her
                  husband was out, no one in the house, and that he would not be back for half an
                  hour, that Clure yielded to her solicitations to go in and remain until her
                  husband returned.</p>
               <p>Now, the reader must not imagine that in these things he acted blindly, without a
                  thought of treachery; for on the contrary, his head was full of suspicions all the
                  time. A detective is always suspicious of every one; yet it is a part of their
                  profession never to betray their suspicions, and the greater<pb n="90-91"
                     xml:id="VAC6970-00000046"/> the mystery the stronger the desire to fathom it.
                  Here, to a detective, were signs of a mystery; for it was hardly natural that a
                  woman should act and look as this one did, merely because some man had insulted
                  her on the street, at that early hour in the evening, when her screams would have
                  collected hundreds in a minute. Clure thought of all these things as they went
                  along, and they afforded a stronger inducement for accepting her invitation than
                  the reason which she gave for urging him to enter the house.</p>
               <p>She produced a night-key and he followed her in. The hall was lighted, and its
                  furnishing indicated neatness, if not luxury. Pausing a moment at the foot of the
                  stairs, she intimated by a sign for him to precede her. He did so. Producing
                  another key, after they had ascended, she unlocked the door of a back room, dimly
                  lighted, and invited him to walk in. Not much to his surprise he discovered a bed
                  in the room, neatly curtained all round, and the curtains closely drawn together.
                  She drew up a chair for him and he sat down, pretty thoroughly exhausted.</p>
               <p>The detective now glanced towards her, and instead of appearing more calm, as it
                  was natural she should, now that she was safe in her own house, he noticed that
                  her excitement had visibly increased. Of course his curiosity was augmented to
                  solve this puzzle, but feeling that he ought in justice to his health, to return
                  at once to his hotel, he thought he would rest himself a few moments and then take
                  his leave, but determined to investigate the matter on some future occasion.</p>
               <p>Suddenly she seemed to remember that she had forgotten something, and hurriedly
                  asking him to excuse her for a moment, see darted out and closed the door, at the
                  same time locking it, as he thought by the sound, and as he soon became aware when
                  he tried to follow her.</p>
               <p>Clure now no longer had a doubt that he was in a snare of some kind, but of what
                  character, he could not even imagine. A careful scrutiny failed to discover any
                  secret or trap-doors, and he next turned his attention to the bed. Pulling back
                  the curtain, he discovered that the bed was occupied by some person whose head was
                  entirely covered by the counterpane.</p>
               <p>"Hallo! who are you?" exclaimed the detective.</p>
               <p>Obtaining no answer, he laid his hand on the shoulder of the person—whether man or
                  woman, he could not tell—but giving a good shake, called out again. Still no
                  reply.</p>
               <p>The detective then went to the mantel, and taking up the lamp returned to the bed,
                  determined to know what manner of person it was fastened into the room with
                  him.</p>
               <p>Turning down the bed-clothes, a sight met his gaze which transfixed him with
                  horror. There lay a young woman with her throat cut from ear to ear, with pools of
                  dark, clotted blood covering the lower sheet. The sight was so terrible and
                  unexpected, that under the circumstances, and in his debilitated condition, he
                  came near fainting.</p>
               <p>As soon as he could recover his self-possession, he laid his hand upon the body,
                  which was still warm, but the breath of life had departed. Like a shock of
                  electricity, the thought now flashed upon him why he had been decoyed there, and
                  staggering back he would have fallen had he not dropped in a chair. It was now
                  evident that the woman had locked him in that she might go for assistance, and
                  that he would be accused of the murder. The woman who could be vile enough to
                  concoct such a fiendish plot against an innocent man would not scruple to commit
                  perjury. She would swear positively to his being the murderer, which would be so
                  strongly corroborated by the circumstances stances, that he had not one chance in
                  a hundred to escape conviction, unless he could get witnesses from New-York to
                  testify as to who he was, and the character which he bore. Nor could he depend
                  even upon that evidence, for an acquittal, for what are supposed to be very good
                  men often commit the crime of murder.</p>
               <p>The situation of Clure was desperate, and only desperate means could liberate him
                  from it. He tried to burst open the door, but the effort was useless. He rushed to
                  the window. It looked out upon a small back yard, and by straining his eyes he
                  could just discern a gate, leading into an alley way. If he could reach the ground
                  in safety, there might be a chance for him to escape. But he was too weak to risk
                  a leap so high. The fall would either stun or cripple him, and then he could not
                  get away. What could he do?</p>
               <p>A rope!—O, for a rope!—He would willingly have paid a thousand dollars at that
                  moment for twenty feet of good hempen cord. Again he sat down to reflect, but his
                  brain was confused. He felt premonitory symptoms of a relapse of his sickness.
                  Already the fever was in his veins. His pulses throbbed, and darting pains were
                  shooting through his head. But this was no time for yielding to sickness.
                  Something must be done, and that quickly, if he would escape being arrested as a
                  murderer.</p>
               <p>Suddenly a thought recurred to him, was there a cord to the bedstead?—or were the
                  mattresses supported by slats? By an effort he arose and staggered forward.
                  Joy!—joy! There was a bedcord, and he would be saved.</p>
               <p>Almost rudely, and yet with a shudder, he rolled the corpse off to the floor—then
                  the bedding followed. O, how his head ached! he was almost blind, yet he seized
                  the cord and nervously commenced unreeving it.</p>
               <p>And here let us add by way of excusing his foolish conduct, that had he been in
                  perfect health, with his mind clear and strong, he would never have acted so
                  insanely. But he would as soon as he had discovered the corpse, have replaced
                  everything as he found it, and having seated himself, calmly awaited the return of
                  the woman and officers for whom she had evidently gone out. On their arrival, he
                  would have at once informed them in a clear collected manner, how he came in the
                  house, and expressed a pleasure at meeting them. Then, when they charged him with
                  the murder, have laughed at them, carefully concealing the fact that he knew there
                  was a corpse in the room. Then when they exposed the body of the murdered woman,
                  he would have expressed just enough of surprise and horror to arouse a suspicion
                  in their minds that he was innocent. He would have insisted upon being arrested,
                  and also demanded that the woman should be arrested also. He could then have
                  communicated with the department in New York, and when his trial came on, stood an
                  easy chance of being acquitted. But he was weak and sick, his brain was
                  disordered, and he did the very worst he could for himself.</p>
               <p>He had the bed-cord half removed when he heard the front door open. It was now too
                  late—he heard footsteps upon the stairs—heard the murmur of voices, but like a
                  madman, still he tugged away. There was a kink in the rope, and it would not
                  render. With a yell of despair he <choice>
                     <sic>siezed</sic>
                     <corr>seized</corr>
                  </choice> upon it with all his strength, instead of throwing out the kink as he
                  might easily have done, but it was as unyielding as adamant. At that moment the
                  door was opened, and two officers, followed by the woman, entered the room. He
                  scarcely heeded them. It seemed in his half <choice>
                     <sic>delirum</sic>
                     <corr>delirium</corr>
                  </choice> as though his life depended upon unreeving that cord.</p>
               <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6970-00000047"/>
               <p>Horrible indeed must have been the sight that met their gaze. The corpse was half
                  covered with the mattresses and quilts, leaving the head and ghastly wound across
                  the throat, fully exposed to sight. For half a minute they stood as though
                  paralyzed, while he still worked at the bed-cord. He had relieved the kink, and at
                  last it was unrove.</p>
               <p>Never once thinking that escape in that way was impossible, or that his best
                  chance was now through the door, he took the chord to the window, leaving one end
                  fast to the bedstead. Raising the window he was actually trying to get out, when
                  the officers seized him.</p>
               <p>His strength was gone, and he felt that his reason was fast failing him. Uttering
                  a signal of distress, known only to craftsmen, and which rings in the heart of a
                  brother like the cry of mercy, he asked if there was no escape from the
                  temple—asked if every gate was guarded by a ruffian.</p>
               <p>There was a response from one of the officers who enquired—</p>
               <p>"How is this, brother?"</p>
               <p>"I am innocent," he replied, "in spite of all the circumstances. That woman
                  decoyed me here and locked me in. I am a stranger and was trying to escape; but I
                  am dying now and it makes no difference—only arrest her. I—I—send to New York—the
                  Detect—" and at this point he lost all consciousness.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XLV.</head>
               <p>For weeks the fever raged through his system, and yet he knew it not. His reason
                  was a blank. Those who attended upon him said that he was constantly raving about
                  a kink in a rope, and that he would go through the motions with his hands as
                  though overhauling a coil of rigging.</p>
               <p>At last he awoke to consciousness. Strange faces were about him, and in vain he
                  tried to recall the past. He could not even remember that he was in New Orleans;
                  he thought he was in New York. He tried to speak, but he was told that he must be
                  silent; that he was among friends and that he must not perplex himself even by
                  trying to think.</p>
               <p>We will not tire the reader with the details of his recovery. In due course of
                  time he learned that he was a prisoner, under the charge of murder, but that the
                  jailor being a "Brother," at the earnest solicitation of one of the officers who
                  arrested him, had taken him into his house, which formed part of the jail, where
                  he had been tenderly cared for, notwithstanding the suspicion resting upon all
                  minds, that he was a murderer.</p>
               <p>Memory came back—the scenes of that fatal night all returned, passing before his
                  mind like a panorama. He enquired for the officer who had commended him to the
                  jailor, and learned that he had been out of the city for three weeks—away on
                  secret business. And the murdered woman? An inquest had been held, the coroner's
                  jury having returned a verdict that she came to her death by his hands. But the
                  woman who decoyed him into the house—where was she? The officers had taken her in
                  charge, and she was now lying in jail, awaiting the result of Clure's trial, which
                  was set down for the next week. It was barely possible that she might have been
                  connected with the murder, and she had been detained. But all the circumstances
                  pointed to the New York detective as the real criminal. Mr. Clure's first act was
                  to secure the services of an able lawyer. This was effected by the jailor, who
                  introduced a "Brother." To him the prisoner narrated everything just as it
                  occurred, including an account of the business which brought him to New
                  Orleans.</p>
               <p>Of course he was believed, for his assurances were given upon his honor as a man
                  and a * * * * *. In return the lawyer promised to aid him by every means in his
                  power.</p>
               <p>Then came the preliminary examination. The woman who caused his arrest was placed
                  upon the stand. She gave the name of Sarah Clark; said she was a widow, and had
                  lately arrived in the city from New York. Her account of the murder was briefly as
                  follows, which was carefully noted down by the prisoner's lawyer and the
                  Court:</p>
               <p>She had only been living a week in the house where the murder was committed; she
                  hired it for the purpose of taking a few boarders; the day before the murder the
                  prisoner applied there for board for himself and wife; an agreement was made, and
                  he brought deceased there; witness supposed deceased was his wife; everything
                  passed off pleasantly until the evening of the murder. When between eight and nine
                  o'clock, she heard angry voices in the room occupied by prisoner and his wife, she
                  crept up stairs, prompted by her womanly curiosity, to learn the cause; heard
                  deceased accuse prisoner of being connected with a gang of counterfeiters which he
                  did not deny; she also threatened to expose him; prisoner then threatened to cut
                  her throat from car to ear. Witness became frightened, and hardly knowing what she
                  did, turned the key in the door, which happened to be on the outside, and then
                  rushed out of the house for officers. That was all she knew about it.</p>
               <p>On cross examination, Clure's lawyer treated her with the utmost kindness, as
                  though he believed every word of her statement. His plan was to learn the theory
                  of the prosecution, without exposing his points of defence. These he would reserve
                  for the trial.</p>
               <p>He asked her several apparently unimportant questions with a great show of
                  indifference. She answered promptly, and in no way contradicting her evidence in
                  chief.</p>
               <p>According to her statement, she was a lone woman; her husband had been a sea
                  captain; was lost at sea two years before; did not know the name of the owners of
                  the ship; had forgotten the name of the vessel. Witness did her own work; could
                  not afford to keep servants; had not been out of the house on the night of the
                  murder, until she went for the officers; was positive in this statement.</p>
               <p>This was the substance of her testimony, to which was added that of the officers
                  who arrested him, detailing all the circumstances. This case looked dark indeed,
                  and he was remanded for trial, Sarah Clark being detained as a witness. She asked
                  to be released on bail, but failed to furnish the necessary security, and was
                  committed.</p>
               <p>To the prisoner, his way now seemed clear. She had sworn positively to his having
                  engaged board with her on the first day of October. when he took up his residence
                  there. An <foreign xml:lang="LAT">alibi</foreign> was easy of proof; the clerk of
                  the hotel where he had been stopping would prove that he did not leave there until
                  after dinner of the 2nd.</p>
               <p>Clure's lawyer went to the hotel, as soon as the examination had closed. He
                  returned with an air of gloom upon his countenance. The clerk was positive that he
                  did not leave the hotel until the <emph>third</emph>! This was proving too much.
                  The prisoner had been taken into custody on the evening of the
                  <emph>second</emph>, and therefore the clerk's testimony, as his witness would
                  prejudice his case.</p>
               <p>Mysteries and obstacles seemed to multiply, The body of the murdered woman had
                  been kept as long as possible for identification, and then buried.<pb n="94-95"
                     xml:id="VAC6970-00000048"/> No one had come forward to claim it; and who she
                  was, still remained a mystery. The mistake of the clerk was easily accounted for,
                  but the explanation would avail nothing at the trial. At the hotel, no one had
                  happened to miss him until the next day. He had given a fictitious name to the
                  clerk; but the officers had discovered his true name by papers found upon him. So
                  the clerk did not think of him as the murderer, when he read an account of the
                  tragedy next day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Brady, the counsel for Clure, next employed a detective, who was also a
                  brother, by the name of Wilson, to work up the case, and try, by every means in
                  his power, to ferret out the mystery, for the lawyer had not a doubt of the
                  innocence of his client.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wilson called upon the prisoner—listened attentively to his story, and
                  although convinced that Clure spoke the truth, was obliged to say that the case
                  looked dark indeed. However, he would leave no means untried to develop the hidden
                  facts in the case.</p>
               <p>It was the evening before the day set down for his trial. His health was not fully
                  restored, although it would have been but for his confinement. Nervously he was
                  pacing his narrow room, when the jailor came to announce that some friends,
                  accompanied by the attorney, wished to see him.</p>
               <p>"Admit them," replied the prisoner, still continuing his walk.</p>
               <p>The next moment a pair of arms were thrown lovingly about his neck, and a fair
                  young girl was sobbing on his breast.</p>
               <p>She did not speak—he could not see her face—-and yet he knew it must be his
                  betrothed—-gentle Ellen, for he had no other female friend to care for him so
                  tenderly.</p>
               <p>"How is this, John?" exclaimed the voice of his uncle, and the next moment he felt
                  his strong arms about him.</p>
               <p>Ellen was the niece of his uncle's wife, and therefore no relation to him,
                  although he had always called her "cousin." Hence it will not seem so strange to
                  the reader that she had placed herself under his protection and came to visit her
                  betrothed in his dire extremity.</p>
               <p>When their mutual greetings were over, there was another <choice>
                     <sic>suprise</sic>
                     <corr>surprise</corr>
                  </choice> in store for the prisoner. The New-York Chief was actually of the party,
                  and greeted him very kindly. Last, the officer who had proved himself a "brother"
                  at the time of his arrest, claimed his acquaintance. The secret of his absence
                  from New Orleans was now explained. While Clure was raving in delirium, he had
                  posted off to New York, on the strength of what the former was saying when he
                  fainted at the time of his arrest, and having found the Chief, learned that a part
                  of the statement was true. Together they called on his uncle, and Ellen happening
                  to be there on a visit, learned all that had befallen John. These things accounted
                  for the presence of his friends in New Orleans, just in time to be of service to
                  him.</p>
               <p>Upon consulting with his counsel it was now decided that no continuance should be
                  asked for, but they would go to trial next day. If convicted, he would so manage
                  with bills of exceptions as to obtain a new trial, and in the mean time every
                  available means should be employed to seek a solution of the mysterious murder.
                  Young Clure's friends all believed him innocent, and that of itself, to say
                  nothing of the pleasure he derived from the presence of his betrothed, afforded
                  him great happiness.</p>
               <p>Everything having been satisfactorily arranged, they were about to take their
                  leave, when Ellen insisted that she could not be separated from him. It was a
                  strange freak, but neither argument nor <choice>
                     <sic>pursuasion</sic>
                     <corr>persuasion</corr>
                  </choice> could move her. One of two things must be done—either her uncle must
                  remain also, or he must be married. The jailor could not allow the former—even
                  doubted the propriety of the latter, though they were married. But to the last
                  alternative he finally consented, on condition that two sentinels should be placed
                  at the door, and two outside the window—the expense of which should be paid by the
                  prisoner.</p>
               <p>It would be a gloomy wedding, and young Clure tried to dissuade Ellen from it.</p>
               <p>"If you are <choice>
                     <sic>acquited</sic>
                     <corr>acquitted</corr>
                  </choice>, John, do you not intend to marry me?" asked Ellen, in a tone which
                  betrayed the depths <choice>
                     <sic>of of</sic>
                     <corr>of</corr>
                  </choice> her woman's love and constancy.</p>
               <p>"Most assuredly, my darling," he replied, folding the lovely girl to his
                  heart.</p>
               <p>"And if you are to die on the gallows lows, or be sentenced to long years of
                  imprisonment, it must be only as my husband. Then why delay the ceremony even for
                  an hour?"</p>
               <p>Not on his own account had young Clure hesitated, but from a feeling of delicacy
                  for his beloved Ellen. Being assured that in no way could he cause her so much
                  pain as by refusing, he gladly consented and they were married forthwith.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XLVII.</head>
               <p>On the following day the trial commenced. Ellen was permitted to sit in the dock
                  beside her husband, and more than one eye was turned admiringly upon her fresh
                  young beauty, and the fond and trusting look with which she regarded him during
                  the trial.</p>
               <p>Ellen afterwards confessed that she had planned the marriage, just as it came off,
                  before leaving New-York, believing that her consenting to wed him under the
                  circumstances, and her presence as the prisoner's bride during the trial, might
                  produce a strong influence in his favor, which proved that she had genius enough
                  to be worthy of being the wife of a detective.</p>
               <p>Sarah Clark was examined for the prosecution, and gave the same evidence, almost
                  word for word, that she did at the preliminary examination.</p>
               <p>Mr. Brady now commenced a critical cross-examination, taking care not to alarm her
                  by seeming to doubt anything she said. She affirmed again and again that she did
                  not go out on the evening of the murder, until after she had locked the prisoner
                  into the room, when she went for the officers.</p>
               <p>At this stage in his cross-examination, Mr. Brady motioned to Detective Wilson.
                  The detective came forward, inside the bar, and held a whispered conversation with
                  him, both occasionally glancing at the witness. She became uneasy, and her
                  countenance changed several times. They continued whispering a moment longer, both
                  watching her closely. Then the detective spoke aloud pointing at the witness:</p>
               <p>"I know I am not mistaken, and am ready to swear to it!"</p>
               <p>The effect of this simple remark upon her was like a shock of electricity. She
                  became so agitated that she could scarcely stand. Mr. Brady now turned towards her
                  with a frown, saying in a hoarse voice—</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Clark, how came you to say that you was not out, on the evening of the
                  murder, until you went for the officers.</p>
               <p>"I forgot," she stammered, "I was so—so—con—confused and frightened."</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Clark did you meet this detective on the street the first time you were out
                  on that evening, and before the time you went for the officers?"</p>
               <p>She hesitated in her reply, waiting for some sign. In a moment the detective
                  nodded his head in the affirmative.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir—I think I did."</p>
               <p>"On Sycamore street?" [Detective shook his head.]</p>
               <p>"No sir—it was not on Sycamore street."</p>
               <p>"On St. Mary's street?" [Detective nodded affirmatively.]</p>
               <p>"Yes sir—St. Mary's street."</p>
               <p>"Was the detective standing on the opposite corner at the time you approached the
                  prisoner and enquired the direction to Cumberland street?" Detective again nodded
                  in the affirmative.]</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir—I—think—so."</p>
               <p>"Was it light enough for the detective to see that you took the prisoner's arm at
                  the time the prisoner started with you to show you the way to Cumberland street?"
                  [Another nod from the detective.]</p>
               <p>"Yes—sir."</p>
               <p>The witness now appeared like a person under a spell—as though completely
                  magnetized by the detective, from whom she never moved her eyes, and obliged to
                  answer just as he gave her the signal, without the least regard to consequences,
                  or what she had previously stated. Nor was the witness the only one who seemed
                  fascinated. A death-like silence pervaded the Court room, while every eye was
                  fixed upon the witness with a steady gaze. Mr. Brady saw his advantage and
                  followed it up.</p>
               <p>"Did you ever see the prisoner, Mrs. Clark, before the time you spoke to him and
                  enquired the way to Cumberland street?" [An emphatic negative from the
                  detective.]</p>
               <p>"No sir—not that—not that—I—I know of."</p>
               <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6970-00000049"/>
               <p>Her situation was now painful to behold. Her face was livid—cold perspiration
                  stood in drops upon her brow—she was leaning forward towards the detective—her
                  lips apart—her hands working nervously, while her eyes were glassy and seemed
                  starting from their sockets. She had ruined herself, and yet she did not seem to
                  comprehend it. For a moment after the last answer, the silence was painful. Then
                  there was a murmur which rose almost to a cheer.</p>
               <p>The spell was broken, and the witness then comprehended what she had said. The
                  terror with which she gazed about the room was truly pitiable. She was fairly
                  trapped, and Mr. Brady was not disposed to allow her any time to plan an
                  escape.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Clark, with what kind of a knife was that woman murdered?"</p>
               <p>She hesitated, and again her eyes sought the detective for a signal. But he only
                  returned her look with a calm steady gaze.</p>
               <p>"Come—answer me quick!"</p>
               <p>"A bu—bu—"</p>
               <p>"Out with it!"</p>
               <p>"A—butcher knife." She was again coming under the spell.</p>
               <p>"What became of that knife?"</p>
               <p>"Under the floor—in—the—attic."</p>
               <p>There was another murmur and again the spell was broken. She now seemed to realize
                  that she was hopelessly lost. With a piteous groan she fainted and fell back in
                  the witness box.</p>
               <p>An officer was despatched to the house where the murder was committed, and soon
                  returned, bringing the bloody knife, which he found concealed as described by Mrs.
                  Clark.</p>
               <p>By this time the perjured witness was restored to consciousness.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Clark," began the counsel for the prisoner, "your only hope is now to tell
                  the truth. What was the name of the man connected with you in the murder of that
                  woman?"</p>
               <p>"He went by the name of Janagin here, but his right name was Swartwin."</p>
               <p>"Who was the woman murdered?"</p>
               <p>"His mistress—Mattie Wood—He seduced and then got tired of her."</p>
               <p>"Where is Swartwin now?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know—he was here in Court this morning."</p>
               <p>The counsel for the State here signified his willingness to submit the case to the
                  jury without argument, which was agreed to, when they returned a verdict of NOT
                  GUILTY without leaving their seats.</p>
               <p>In order for the reader to understand the singular influence which the detective
                  exercised over Mrs. Clark, we have only to state that he paid her several visits
                  in jail, until, by mesmeric power, always professing to be her friend, without her
                  knowledge, he had acquired a complete control over her mental faculties, thereby
                  compelling her to answer as he willed.</p>
               <p>Of course the reader has already recognized the outcast, in the character of Mrs.
                  Clark.</p>
               <p>Swartwin had murdered Mattie Wood himself, in order to be rid of her, and then
                  compelled Magdalena to do as she had, in order to escape suspicion himself.</p>
               <p>Swartwin was in the Court during the trial, but the perturbation which he
                  manifested when the outcast betrayed herself, so excited the suspicion of the New
                  York Chief, that he caused his arrest, as he was attempting to leave the room.</p>
               <p>In due course of time, Swartwin was tried, convicted and executed.</p>
               <p>Magdalena was pronounced insane and sent to an asylum, where she remained for a
                  year.</p>
               <p>During this time she thoroughly reformed, and having recently returned to New
                  York, she called on Dr. Pulsifer when she learned for the first time the provision
                  her father had made in her favor, and she is now in possession of seven-eigths of
                  his great fortune.</p>
               <p>But remorse for her past infamies—especially her causing the death of Desmondo,
                  and her connexion with the murder of Mattie Wood, induced her to remove to
                  Cincinnati, where she is still living, beloved for her many virtues, and her
                  numerous charities in behalf of the poor and fallen.</p>
               <p>A few words and we close. The N. O. C., signifying "New Orpheus Club," to
                  outsiders, but "<hi rend="i"/>Nacky Optime Cleans" (Ingenious, first-class
                  Experts,) among themselves—this Club was duly broken up, and all its members sent
