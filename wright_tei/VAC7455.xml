F. GLEASON, PROPRIETOR.    $ ,.   C. THE IIt sIABEL   CHAPTER I.   ' Far o'er the sea with tireless wing we fly I'   T  HE sun was just setting in a sea- of golden - fire on which purple cloudlets- reposed like islands in heaven. The blue ocean un- dulated with a swinging motion, but without a ripple to ruffle the crystalline polish of its mirror- like surface. On the south-lay the island of Cuba, that rich prize of the nations, its long serrated back Tariegated with tropical woodlands, green plantations and snow-white. villas; for many a league .from east to west it stretched its leviathanic form like a vast monster of the deep motionless i eternal sleep. The twin-peaks-of the Pan of Matanzas, ,catohing :and longest hold-. ing the beams pf the descending sun, seemed to, be altars on, whi4C buraed eveniog saarifioial fires, while the vale between was deepening into the shadows of twilight. . Eky, elouds, sea and isl-. and, comprised the whole scen, ,yet itW was beau- tiful, seen as the whole was, though a yeil of the roseate atmosphere, which lends at such an hour in this latitude such a charm to a land- 7   scape. The mystic haze magnified all objects, making the sun appear seven times larger than when at the zenith, and elevating the hills into mountains and the mountains into Alps; while the horizon seemed to ascend'to meet the arch- ing heavens, rather than the heavens to bend downward to its verge. There were not wanting eyes to admire the. scene we have painted; ;for here and there, dot ting the heart-beating' sea, were visible barques rocking ,listleasly to the mction of .the heavings ocean; w it. windless canvss, and useless helm. Two or three of these,       reiohr hore with lugger sails and low 4uls tearoed. be Span- ish fihe;rmen, out on the deep p ing their dailyocoupation; one other, which lay directly in the path of the sun, in which it had remained a few moments as he went down, like a picture of a ship in a circular frame of fiery gold,? wa evidently a merohantman bound, into the Mexi- can Gulf., Far in the northern board were  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7455-00000003"/> visible at different remote distances two other craft, the character of which could not be made out, as their hulls were hidden by the periphery of the globe-curved sea, and only one or two sails appeared above the verge of the watery horizon. There were two other vessels, however, which, being more in the centre of the scene we have tried to place before the-mind's eye of our read- er, could be clearly made out from deck to truck, and even the flags which distinguished the na- tion of one of them. These vessels were less than a Spanish league apart, and their distance about equal from the shore of the island, which was not a mile off on their larboard beam, as they lay with their bows towards the west. They were very unlike in size and rig, the one which was farthest east being a frigate, while the other was a schooner something after the bucca- neer class, having taunt, raking masts, a low hull, very sharp bows and being armed with six carronades, three on a side, with a bow-gun on a circle just forward the windlass over the heel of the bow-sprit. The frigate had showed Spanish colors at her peak until the sun dipped, when firing a bow- gun to leeward she hauled it down; and as we introduce her to our reader, the blue brown smoke of the burnt powder is slowly floating on an almost imperceptible current of air in the di- rection of the land. The schooner, on the contrary, had shown no colors before the sun set, and everything re- mained quiet on board of her, so far as seemed to the eye ofthe distant spectators on the shore. Her mainmast had evidently been wounded, for it was splintered; and her foremast, though strong, was composed of half jury-mast, instead of the slender amber-colored topmast which had once graced its pencil-like length. There were also four or five ugly gashes in her waist, and an eighteen pound shot was two thirds buried in the timber under her counter; all signs that she had not traversed the seas unmolested by enemies. The calm which had caught the various ves- sels that the shining ring of the horizon now en-   closed, had continued since three o'clock in the afternoon, up to which time the frigate and schooner had been sailing westwardly as their prows now pointed. The lull of the wind had caught them nearer together than we now see them, but as the schooner held the wind for full ten minutes after the sails of the frigate ceased to draw, it had shot onward out of reach of the large vessel's guns; for just at the time the breeze fell, the frigate had opened a chase-fire upon the small vessel, an amusement in which she had been engaged from tide to time, as for- tune and the wind favored, for the last twenty- four days, during which time the schooner had been flying from her across the Atlantic. The frigate finding the calm likely to hold, had sent out her boats ahead to tow, hoping by this means to come again within range of the chase; but this manoeuvre was imitated by the latter, and after three hours hard rowing, both vessels holding the same distance apart as at- first, the frigate called her boats aboard, and the schooner doing the same, the two vessels re- mained quietly where we find them at sundown, waiting for 'the sea-breeze to blow landward, in- dications of which were just visible in the direc- tion taken by the scarcely moving cloud of gun- smoke, the sluggish motion of which, as after hanging for a few moments about the ship like a veil, it floated gently shoreward, was watched with equal interest from the decks of both ves- sels. ' Gracioso viento!' exclaimed the captain of the chased craft, as he satisfied himself that the cloud was in motion landward; ' we shall have the wind yet! Adios, Senor Admiral,' he ad- ded, lightly shaking his jewelled fingers in the direction of the frigate, while a haughty and defiant smile lighted up his dark and singularly handsome   face. 'Six hours fair breeze, and we shall enter the harbor of Havana in safety!' 'Havana?' repeated, with an   interrogative tone of surprise not unmingled with alarm, a young Castilian-who stood near him, removing at the same time a  spy-glass from his eye, -with which for some time he had been closely observ- ing the frigate astern.   'And why are you amazed, my good Garcila- so?' replied the captain of the schooner, look- ing him in the eyes, as if he would pour through them into his soul the inspiration of his own daring courage. ' It will be instant ruin, Enrique; inevitable death for you to trust yourself there,' repeated the youthful Don Garcilaso, laying his hand almost timidly on-the wrist of the tall, and noble- looking captain, who towered above him the chest and head the taller, and raising his eyes up to his with the tearful glory of a Madonna beaming in them. The look was beseeching yet earnest, and beneath it within the deep soul lay a fountain of affection, from' the holy depths of which could alone have risen those sparkling globules that trembled in her eyes. - We have used the feminine pronoun, for this youth was a maiden-and one whose life was wrapped up in the life of him on whose arm she now hung, into whose dark eyes she now poured the warmth \ of her own. ' Nay, Mariana,' he breathed in a low tone, that reached only her ear; ' be not so womanly, or you will betray yourself, and thou art half suspected already.' He then continued in an ordinary voice, as he looked round to his lieu- tenant and the helmsman who were within hear- ing, ' There is no danger, such as Garcilaso fears,- in going into Havana. We are not known! We are the first to bring tidings of our- selves, and who will heed or trouble themselves about a stranger? I shall boldly run in, if the frigate press us not too closely, as soon as I reach the port.' 'We shall then be captured without fail, senor,' said the lieutenant, with a dark frown, and twirling upwards with his fore-finger and thumb his long gray mustache; for he was a man of twice the years of his commander, a hard, weather-browned Arragonese, with a stern Roman physiognomy, and shoulders like a Her- cules. 'What-do you fear, Balco?' said the cap- tain, looking at him closely, and with a slight frown on his otherwise smooth, well-cut brows. ' I am not a coward,' responded the lieuten- ant, sententiously.   ' No one who knows you would believe it, Balco; though one hundred of the best men in all Spain should swear it on the holy cross.' ' Then if you don't doubt my courage, senor, I beg you will allow me to agree with your nephew, Don Gareilaso, who says truly and wisely, that for a man like you to go openly into Havana, would be the same as for a thief, begging your pardon, sir, running to the hang. man's house for shelter. Don Garcilaso is right.' 'Yes, Enrique, your fearless spirit that knows no danger, despises it and never sees it; but,' added the maiden, ' your life is not immortal. The fatal dart may reach your bosom as well as others, and then-then--  ' 'Then,' he said, smiling as he pressed her hand, and bent'on her an encouraging and pro- tecting eye, ' what will become of thee? thou wouldsthave finished by saying. This thought would make a coward of me. For thy sake, life is dear and ever sweet, fair Mariana,' he said, whispering to her. -His words were res- ponded to by a world of love, that filled her glorious eyes, like silvery goblets overrunning with rich wine. Had he been alone with her, in his cabin, he felt as he saw this overflow of brimming love, that he would have pressed his lips to the pair of goblets and quaffed the dewy draughts. ' Thou art betraying thyself. I will talk with thee soon, if you will go below. Old Balco half sees through thee, how I Thy dress is manly, but the womanis in all thy face.' The maiden who felt she was in danger of betraying, through her affection, a secret which it was needful should be preserved, at once left the deck. ' The boy is so much'attached to me, Balco I' in a carelessly apologetic way, observed the captain, as the graceful youth disappeared. ' He almost makes a woman of himself I' 'He I' grunted the rude spoken Arragonese seaman. ' And what do you mean by " he?" ' That it would not take much to make a wo- man of her I' answered the lieutenant, without moving a muscle of his face. 'So, then, you know the secretV' said Don  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7455-00000004"/> Enrique, approaching him, and speaking in an tunder tone. ' If so, keep it to thyself. How hast thou discovered it?' ' From the first' day she came on board with thee, at the castle pier in Spain.' ' Thou hast proved faithful then, -to keep it, good Balco.' ' Thou seest that I am to be trusted, senor,' he said, with a scarcely perceptible smile cf ;  pride visible in his sea-worn visage. Forgive me, Balco, that I did not know thee before, so well as I do now 1 I have wronged thee.' I should have given thee my confidence at the first; but we were almost strangers.' ' It is well as it is. I did not ask it, senor. I think only of duty on board ship, and seldom meddle in other matters.' ' Prom this hour then, I will confide in you. I know you are my friend.' 'You have none truer, senor; and one -of these days I may tell you what it is that binds me to you with gratitude. But let that pass now. Will you take my advice, and not think of going into Havana?' "isten first, good Balco. My motive in sailing for Cuba, you may not know. But I am wholly unknown to any here, save one. My plan, formed' on the voyage is to go into the harbor of Havana, sell my schooner at once,. and then trust my fortunes on the shore, where I have schemes and intrigues, interests and pur- poses,'that will sufficiently employ me, without troubling myself about the schooner, which has achieved its errand when it lands me in Cuba i ' True, in, Cuba-but why, senor, why in Havana I You say you are not known there! Do you not know that the relations between Cuba and Spain are so close, that there is con- stant communicatiohi kept up between them, and a ceaseless interchange of individuals. The first h0ir you walk the Streets of Havana, you may meet twenty men whom you have known in Madrid or Toledo 1' ' True! You are right, Balco. Your gray hairs hold the wisdom that mine lack. I did not think of this truth thou hastjust now spoken. I fancied over the sea oblivion of the Old World.   i But if I do not run into Havana, which is some r ninety miles to the west of us, the same objec- tion will lie against Matanzas and Cardenas, which the chart places not far ahead on the north of the island.' ' Yes, Matanzas will not do. You may be known there; and which ever port we enter we shall be closely followed by the frigate; and in .. - e -hours after, you will be a marked man, with a reward on your head, that will set all men hunting thee.' ' As if I were a wild-boar!' ' Yes.' ' What would you advise, Balco. You know the island well, you say.' 4 Yes, every bay and inlet, every nook and crook of its shore. It was on and about this island, I passed the first twenty-five years of my life.'  'Thou didst not before tell me thou wert a Cuban, Balco.' 'No, I have told thee little about myself. I am not given to talking save on questioning. The island I know well, and I would advise ' you to run the vessel into some secluded inlet, and debark 'where you could not be observed.' ' And leave my vessel to rot on the beach? I am too poor for this loss, Balco. I need more money than I possess, and I look to the sale of my schooner to obtain it.  It is therefore that I have been willing to run all the risks of going into Havana, in order that I might dispose of her.' ' If this is your only motive, senor, for this rash action, I will purchase your vessel from you'!' 'You, senor lieutenant?   You pay down some five thousand Spanish pesos, out of your pay of one hundred per month? I would will- ingly sell you the craft, my good Balco, but not on credit.' Alse lieutenant smiled under the surface, if we may so express the peculiar expression of his features, and after stroking his mustache com- placently downwards, he responded: ' I will pay cash, senor captain!' The;captain did -not make any reply, for he   had felt a breeze upon his forehead, and was now holding up his moistened palm to see if he 'I1 were received. The frigate was dimly seen in reE the distant obscurity created by the twilight, W with the evening star which had just risen, rest- tin ing, seemingly, on the very truck of her main- th mast, like a lambent flame. ' There is shme air, Balco! This laggard w wind is waking up from its long day's sleep on a the sea.' 'Yes, sir, I feel it now, plainly. In ten be minutes we shall be able to make sail.'   tl Don Enrique had the glass at .his eye, and is was watching the frigate. All at once he ex- elaimed with disappointment:         S  'The frigate's fore royal swells out steadily, p she has the wind aloft, and may come down tl upon us with a sky-wind under her royals, be- V fore we feel a cat's paw!'         o ' In that case,' remarked the lieutenant, pac- ing the quarter-deck backwards and forwards m two or three times, 'in that case, we shall d have to set the schooner on fire, and escape to -g the shore in our boats. It is the only alterna- ( tive. She is tooheavyfor us to fight her.'  E ' With all my rashness, good Balco, I should I hardly be so mad as to fight seven guns against I forty-two. The frigate has the wind aloft in all ( her royals. She is in motion and coming down. c The question whether we go into Havana or not is likely to be settled for us in a short time, unless the good wind blows!' ' She feels it aloft-our topsails have got it!' eried Balco, with emotion unusual to him. ' There, she moves! I hear plainly the ripple under'the ruddersenor. The frigate will hard- ly catch us this time I' and the old. man twisted his mustaches up stiffly on each side of his nose as if in defiance of the enemy. There was no mistake as to the motion of the schooner. Don Enrique taking a coil of small line from the companion-way, to: which was at- tached a triangular plate of wood, cast it over the side. It no longer remained stationary as it had done a score of times before that afternoon when thrown into the water, but slowly fell astern, and was soon at the end of many fathoms of the line.   'A knot and a half, at least,' exclaimed he. 'The wind is increasing i It ruffles the sea al- ready! Now we have it on deck I Two knots! We shall escape them this turn, for the hundredth time they have been so near us since we left the Straits!' ' Senor,' said Balco, ' the frigate has the wind only aloft yet. This that we have is only a puff, and I fear will not last.' 'You are right! Por Santiago I     We are becalmed again,' ejaculated the captain; ' and the frigate with the wind filling her upper sails, is coming on at least two and'a half knots!' Again the log was thrown and now remained stationary abeam. The sea around was unrip- pled, and not a breath of air could be felt by the palm or even by Balco with his tongue, whiCh as the most susceptible organ he thrust out of his mouth to windward. I By our lady of Arragon I' growled Balco, 3 walking now crosswise and now lengthwise the [deck much excited; ' we are not moving a fin- ) ger's length. We are as still as if we were carved and stuck on the. waves like a painted ship in a glass case for children to look at. I Blessed Maria, and all the saints, send us wind! t Holy saint Paulo, breathe upon our canvass! 1 Good saint Peter, blow hard upon our mainsail,  and noble saint Diego, help us with a small r mouthful of air!' and Baleo crossed himself at , each prayer. 'We must fall into the frigate's hands, or !' get out our boats and setting fire to the scoon- i. er make for the-nearest land,' remarkedithe [e young captain, after taking a close observation I- of the frigate's .movements. 'They seeQn to d have made a bargain with the devil for a   Ioyal Be breeze, and no more I' At this moment, Garcilaso appeared on leck, le and with a face expressive of the supposed news dl he bore, he- said to Don Enrique: t- ' From the stern lights, I see the frigate is er approaching us rapidly, while we do not seem to as move!' m   'You are right, Gareilaso,' answered En- ll rique, smiling. '-They have a breeze aloft, and ns as our masts arenot tall enough to reach it, we are becalmed, while they come bravely on 1' O  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7455-00000005"/> Here he directed his glass towards the frigate, and after watching her for a moment, turned quickly and gave stern and stirring orders. ' Lower the gig from the stern davitsI A dozen of you swing the cutter from above the main hatch, over the larboard side, and lower it into the water. Pipe all hands to action, sir boatswain! Some of the men will go down into the cabin and bring up the chests and par- eels there belonging to me and Garciiaso, and place them in the boat. We have no time to lose. The frigate is almost within reach of us *with her forty-two's, and will soon be wearing to open a broadside upon us.' At the sound of his commanding voice, all was activity and energetic action on board. , A  dozen men were engaged launching the boat X which had been lashed amidships, and storing it with their clothing and provisions; while half c as many more lowered the gig and handed into ] it from the stern windows, the valuables that c were in the cabin.  While these proceedings o were going on, Don Enrique was directing two of the men how to lay a train of power from the to larboard gangway to the magazine, which was just abaft the maihmst, in the lowest part of p the vessel. It was already night. The stars shone bright- cl ly upon the sea, and the Milky Galaxy in that torrid latitude glowed like a river of pale moon- T light. The frigate was therefore easily distin- guished, and by the aid of the glass with which li( Balco was now watching her approach,' the out- pC lines of every sail could be made out.   l ' They have not yet got a single puff of the o0 wind below their tops,' he said, in a tone of St mingled surprise and annoyance. 'The saints fit help us, or in five minutes more we shall have of to quit our schooner I'          de 'I have made upmymind todo that already,' Sp answered Don Earique (oolly, as he lighted a two cigar by!the torch whilc he had commannded&amp;a ha negro to light and bring to him, for the purpose ani of setting the train on fire. ' The schooner tiv will have to be sacrificed; bat she has done me pec good service in bringing me within stepping dis- I a tance of Cuba, and I shall givq her up with less wa   te, regret; though I shall be so much the poorer led by her loss.' ' It is a pity, by St. Jago, a bitter pitf, senor, A to set her on fire, so fast a craft, that has had the the glory of beating in a long chase of twenty days, ver the finest frigate in the Spanish navy.' sir  -' To fall at last into her hands!' remarked vn Don Enrique. ir-  'No-not that-we shall burn her first,' res- Id ponded Balco. ' But I gladly would have paid to you five thousand pesos for her!' us  'And where would you get them, my good Ig Balco? Silver dollars do not grow under the heel of a schooner's mainmast.' as  SI have before hinted to you, senor, that I A was well acquainted with this island. I once at commanded a small fleet in these waters.' 'g 'A fleet? You have been an admiral then, If of some half score of fishing-craft, is it so, good to Balco?' said Don Enrique, having at length it completed, while listening and talking, the train s; of powder. O  'You have heard of the celebrated Cape An- e tonio buccaneers?' Yes, wert thou one of them?   I half sus- f petted it, by the mass!' ' I was more than one of them!  I was their chief.' t  'Not the famed Pelayo--Don Lopez Pelayo . - Thou art not he?' 'That is my true name, senor,' answered the I lieutenant, drawing himself up with a haughty port. 'But times are changed with me now, unhappily; with a price set upon my head, after our capture of five rich ships of England and the States in one week, and pursued by vessels fitted out expressly to take me, with two-thirds of my squadron of eleven schooners and sloops destroyed, and the rest dispersed, I escaped to Spain, in my only remaining vessel. This was twenty years or more ago, senor! But time has so changed me, that I am now unknown, and having a   curiosity to see once more my na- tive island, I offered myself to thee in this ex- pedition. You will now understand how it is, I am able to purchase the schooner, and why I wanted it.'   Don Enrique now gazed for a few moments upon the dark face of his grisly-bearded lieu- tenant with deep interest, as recognizing in him a buccaneer chief, whose name and fame had been familiar to his ears in boyhood; at length he replied with a negative shake of the head: ' I can't see where thy money is to come from, good Don Pelayo-' 'Nay, this name in confidence, senor!' said the old buccaneer admiral, quickly; ' thine ear alone!' 'Be it so.' 'In my cruises in those days, I captured gold and silver in large quantities. It was my custom to secrete my share, after giving my men their own. Sometimes I would choose one of the Bahama Keys, where I have still secreted full fifty thousand pesos ; at others I would se- lect some inlet, and beneath a marked rock or tree, dig and bury my money at midnight. On all these occasions, I was accompanied only by a black slave, who was attached to my. person with a faithfulness like that of a dog. Not one league ahead of us on a point-you see it now faintly through the starlight, senor-around which is an inlet that winds like a serpent, into the bottom of a tangled forest. Half a mile from the beach, in the solitude of this jungle at a spot which I can readily recognize, I have twenty-one thousand dollars in Mexican gold and silver, besides plate and jewels. It was with a portion of this wealth, which I have returned to Cuba to recover, that. I intended to pay you for the schooner; and therefore I wished to run the vessel in there, instead of going to Havana!' ' Amor de cielo!' cried Don Enrique; ' but this is a brave story, and gives thee considera- tion with me, noble Balco! If then we lose the schooner, thou wilt have gold on shore to pur- chase another when thou wilt? . I envy thee thy riches!' If we burn the schooner, as we must, since the frigate is coming every moment nigher, 1 will place in your hands its value, senor,' an- swered Balco; 'I know thou needest money more than I; and I have more than I need.' 'Thou art as generous as a prince, senor   Balco, and by- my honor, I must consent to be thy debtor, till fairer times dawn upon us 1 The frigate is in full range, and moving on under the accursed breeze that leaves us as motionless as if we were riding at four anchors astern and abow. The boats are ready! It is time we were in them, unless we wait to take a broad- side of iron! But-hold up your hand I Does not the breeze visit us at last I I felt it on my cheek I' ' It was the wind caused by the flight of yon- der albatross, low across the deck,' said Gar- cilaso. ' Then to the boats. The ocean is as un- ruffled as a lady's mirror. We must take to fight.  To the boats, men all! I will remain last, and fire the train '  'Not you, Enrique! not you,' cried Garei. laso; ' for my sake, do not expose yourself to. this danger!' ' For thy sake then! Here, Coco,' he added, placing the torch in the hands of the African who had assisted in laying the train; ' you re- main and fire the train, and then leap into the water, and swim off to my boat I' The slave received the torch with a smile of gratification, as if the danger and the catastrophe he was about to be the agent of, was pleasing to contemplate, as varieties that were about agreeably to contrast the usual monotony of his life. The two boats were soon filled with the offi- cers and crew, and pulled off, by Don Enrique's command, in the direction of the shore, till they were from the vessel about one hundred fathom; the men then lay on their oars, and Don En- rique rising in the stern of his boat, was about to give the order to the slave, Coco, to ignite the fuse of the train, when a flash from the bows of the frigate, now looming up scarcely a mile dis- tant, arrested his words. It was the blaze of a gun, the report of which rolled like thunder over the water, and at the same moment a heavy iron shot howled through the air above their heads, crossing the stern of the schooner in its passage. 'That is the pioneer of a broadside,' said  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7455-00000006"/> Don Enrique, with that animation which such warlike sounds kindle in the countenance of a brave man. ' Yes,' said Balco, calling out from the second boat which he commanded; 'and Coco will have his head knocked off if he stays on board longer.' "ight the fuse!' shouted Don Enrique, in a clear voice, the very tones of which seemed to be charged with the terrible shock they were about to create, 'Ay, massa captain, me light him!' answered the slave from the deck; and the next moment   a small pile of splinters which had-been placed together on the quarter-deck, by Don Enrique, shot suddenly into flame. The negro at the same instant leaped over the stern, and began to swim like a porpoise towards the nearest boat. He was soon taken on board, and ' Give way, men, all!' was heard from the captain; in obedience to which cormaind, both boats went ploughing over the surface of the sea, in the direction of the island; but not before a broad- side from the frigate sent a shower of iron globes above and around them, burying them in spray and foam. t       /   CHAPTER II. 'Whenf fortune frowns upon the sea, The green land opes its sheltering arms.'   TjHE two boats which had thus deserted the schooner, continued 'to pull with undi- minished speed in the direction of the land. The frigate grew larger and larger, as it neared the smaller vessel, on board of which the flame of the pile of kindling wood still continued to blaze upward; but without having yet kindled the fuse. Don Enrique kept his eyes, during the flight of -his boats, fixed steadily upon his vessel, ex- pecting to see her blow up each moment; and as the frigate drew closer to it, be became im- patient. ' By the cross of saint Porco! It is not going to fire, and they will capture her It ' Me put little damp on em fusee, massa cap- tain,' said Coco, who stood in the bows of the boat, dripping like a Newfoundland dog. ' Me tink it better keep off de blow up little minnit, till de big ship come close by, den it blow em' boffup to debbil      ' ' Well, thought off, Coco,' said Don Enrique; 'if thou hast not put too much " damp " on the oakum, and so let them get on board in time to, put it out.'   'There is a breeze, by all the saints I' shout- ed Balco. ' See how the flame bends out horib zontally, and points this way like a lapping tongue.' Yes, the wind has come down with the ship, and see how the schooner's mainmast fills. Now she moves along through-the water, and not a soul to steer her. I wish now, Balco, we were once more aboard of her.' ' Not to be 'blown up the next minute!' an- swered Balco, dryly. ' See, senor, see I The frigate is becalmed,' exclaimed Garcilaso, with animation, pointing to the tall pyramid of canvass towering and hang- ing listlessly above the dark hull of the ship-of- war. 'You are right, Garcilaso, your sharp eyes have seen truly. 'The frigate has not a breath of wind-'    ' ' And the schooner has taken it, and is run- ning to leeward with it in her'canvass, at the rate of three and a half knots ;' said the' lieuten- ant, with great energy. ' The wind was but a eat's paw for the frigate, * , lff  &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7455-00000007"/> and having helped her along a mile or two, has given the schooner a lift. Now, if we were on board of her, we could run away from the ship, Balco, if the breeze should hold half an hour. She is not going to blow up. The wind blows the flame away from the fuse.' ' But it is too late now,' sighed the lieutenant, ' to Board, blow up or not. Besides, the frigate don't intend to lose her, though she has lost the wind. There goes her larboard broadside into the poor little vessel!' It was as Balco had said. The frigate once more becalmed, almost within half a mile of the chase, now opened a heavy fire upon it, and for five minutes the very skies were rended with the sharp thunder of the cannonading. The schooner, however, Iaving all her sails set and sheeted home, flew on before the breeze, -and sailed as squarely before it as if there had been an invisible helmsman at her wheel. Don Enrique and his officers and crew look- ed on with amazement and expectation; amaze- ment to see her lay her course so well withoqt a hiuman hand to guide her, and in expectation of seeing her blow into the air each moment. But onward she held her way, and the shot from the frigate fell upon her decks and around her, without touching a spot to check her speed. 'Don Enrique, seeing his noble little vessel thus gallantly running away from her foe, felt the impulse of giving a hurra, and could only restrain his crew from this imprudent demon- stration of applause, by warning them that they would thereby bring upon them the fire of the enemy, who had not yet discovered that they had taken to their boats. 'Coco, you must have thrown a bucket of sea-water on the train, you imp,' said the cap- tain, ' or it would have taken fire ere this!' ' No, massa, ony berry little bit,' responded the black; ' but de wind blow de blaze away from de powder, an' it no posseeble catch 'em fire.' 'You are right! The wind seems to be doing its best to keep the schooner out of the frigate's hand, and the flame away from the fuse.'   'Berry good wind, him, massa captain,' an- swered Coco, with a delightful grin, like a battery with white-washed ports. The breeze continued to blow the schooner along under full sail, till gradually it faded in the haze and night of the western board, and finally disappeared altogether. the blaze which had been burning on her quarter-deck, having entirely gone out. The frigate, in the mean- while, having fired a few guns more after her, ceased, and lay motionless, without a breath of air to waft her forward in pursuit. ' This is what I call a strange affair altogether, senor,' said Balco, talking from his boat to his captain in the other; for both boats had remain- ed in their original position watching the ex- traordinary escape of the schooner. 'Yes, the schooner has taken better care of herself than we did of her. The Bel Isabel was always a dashing, proud thing, and she has now given us a specimen of her high blood, Balco.' 'I am afraid she'll be wrecked on the rocks or first cape, senor; it is impossible she should have sense enough to know how much water she draws, and keep the deep channel.' Don Enrique laughed at the idea of such human intelligence in his little craft, and gave Don Balco his opinion that she would not blow up; for the fire had evidently gone out. ' I hope then we shall hear of her again, senor, -and once more get possession of her,' remarked the lieutenant. ' You talk, Balco, of a runaway schooner on the high seas, as if it were a mare broke loose in a meadow, and all you had to do is to take a halter and go and catch her again. I fear you will never see the Bel Isabel more I But we must take care of ourselves I Do you see that bright glow in the east?' ' It is the moon coming up, senor; or a ship on fire in the eastern board.' ' It is the former, Don Balco; and if we let her get up and hold her lamp out over the ocean, we shall be  seen from the frigate, which by its quiet, evidently does not suspect our presence here, but supposes us safe on board the schooner, which, by all the saints, I now would we were I   Give way, men! We must get well under the shadows of the island. Don Balco, you know the coast well, methinks I heard you say.' ' As the creases in the palm of my hand, senor.' 'I am hopes, i' faith, you know it better! as few men know these; for by the rood I if you were to ask me how many lines I had in the palms of my hands I could not tell thee. But, I have faith in thy knowledge, and let thy boat take the lead; for I know the coast of Africa quite as well- as this.' 'We will pull to the west, senor captain. A row of three miles will bring us to the cape I spoke to you of, and thence up an inlet of the sea, we shall find a fisherman's hamlet. There we shall find shelter till morning, when fortune will point the future.' ' Well and philosophically said, good Baleo,' answered Don Enrique, with that gaiety which it seemed no reverse could east a cloud over. ' Pull on, steadily and strongly, my merry men, after the lieutenant's boat.' 'Adelante! in advance,' shouted Baleo; and his eight oarsmen bending to their oars sent the boat swiftly on its way. . The lieutenant at the helm, steered her an oblique course edging in for the shore, while he aimed to make the cape a league in advance. The two boats now steadily held on their way one in the rear of the  other. The measured sound of the rattle in the row-locks mingled with the dash of their oar blades, fell not unmusically on the ears of the maiden, to whom the scene was novel. Seated in the stern of the boat, on one of the luxurious cushions that lined it, her hand, resting unseen in the darkness, in that of her'lover, who with the other guided the boat on her glittering way, she forgot all sense of danger in present happiness. Womanly love knows no fear in the presence and under the protection of the object beloved. The embrace of his arm is the circumference of her world; the light of his eyes as she gazes up into them is the sun of her universe; his smile is softer than moonlight on her soul; and his voice more mel- low than the music of thespheres.  A true wo-   man looks up to man, as a strong man up to God. ' My heart is full--overflowing with gratitude to the virgin, Enrique, that you are safe I' This was whispered so softly, that the breeze which began to play swith her tresses stole not a syllable to bear away to other ears. 'Yes, our danger is past now, sweet,' he an- swered, pressing her hand and secretly touching his lips upon it. ' But let us not speak togeth- er of our happiness now. We draw the atten- tion of the men.' She laid her hamd on her heart with a ges- ture expressive of silent assent, and fixed her eyes upon the rising moon. She saw it roll up the horizon like a great wheel of gold, and throw out upon the waters a glittering track of light, mottled and wavy in the undulations of the sur- face. She was filled -with admiration at the strange beauty with which the frigate was in- vested by the beams of the moon, which gilding the edges of her sails ,and silvering her ropes and spars, left the great mass of the surface of canvass and the hull in perfect blackness-an inky ship edged with silver cord.  The moon- beams also, growing less golden and more sil- very every moment, as the moon got higher and higher, began to light up the hill-tops of the isl. and, to reflect brightly from some granite cliff, or more softly from  the sides of, a forest-clad eminence; while here and there, where the sands of the beach caught its radiance, it seemed dia- mond strewn.   The deep, purple blue of those southern skies, the pure light of the stars that seemed nearer and larger than they ever ap- pear in colder climes, the soft murmur of the surge on the shore, the laughing ripple of the wavelets curled up by the coquetting breeze, were all pleasing sights and sounds to a soul of sensibility, and the spirit of the maiden drank them in with silent and holy joy. Gradually the distance from the frigate wid- ened, and they approached nearer the shore, which at this point rose boldly above the water and flung its dark shadows far out. The fair Castilian fixed her gaze on the frigate till it was blended in the darkness and mist of evening, J  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7455-00000008"/> and its position only indicated by a battle-lan- tern gleaming murkily through the haze across the water. , The frigate must have the wind again by this time, senor,' called out Balco, from the leading boat, which'he was steering close under the land, and so near that individual trees could be made out.              i Yes,' answered Don Bnrique. ' The breeze is so strong now with us, that they must have got it again, and if so, and it were daylight, we shall be able to witness a novel chase, if the pretty Bei Isabel keeps her helm in a seaman- like fashion '  ' The frigate is in motion. Listen!' cried Balco. The oars were suspended an instant, and Don Enrique bending his ear to the water could distinctly hear the far off rattle of cordage, creak- ing of yards swung round, and the faint song, like an echo in the low clouds on the horizon of the laboring seamen o# board. ' Yes, they are squaring their yards to meet the wind, and will soon be in full chase of the Bel again,' remarked Don Enrique. ' But let us leave them to pursue the phantom, and make the best of our way on shore. I am desirous of reaching Havana before the frigate. How far, say you, this tall promontory which flings its huge shadow so far out on the water, is from the capital of Cuba?' ' Twenty-five leagues or more, senor,' an- swered Balco, as he gave orders for his men to resume their rowing. 'But by land it is some- thing less.' ' Then by land I go, if horse can be found to take me-there,' answered the captain, with de- cision. 'Pull hearty and strong, men! We will soon put foot on- the hard ground.' The boats now moved swiftly along the shore of the island, which. they had now so nearly ap- proached that it towered high. above their heads. All was dark and silent on the land, save the gleam of the lamp-like fire-fly, as he sailed here and there, in indolent -ndulations gleaming many yards around, or the sweet cadences of the mooking-bird, singing its carols to the moon,   its clear notes swelling over the water with thrill- ing effect. ' This is Cape de Pledias, senor,' said Balco. f 'You see it is rooky enough to bear the name. On the height above our heads are the ruins of an old fort,- built by Cortez, and afterwards turned into a convent foir the good huns of two hundred years ago. But it isnow in ruins, not a cross or altar remaining, and only a few cells, where some of the free men of the island and sea sometimes within my recollection, used to take up their abode when on shore. But the government did not fancy their presence here, and sent a war-vessel to'bombard the place and drive them out; but :it nevertheless has always been a favorite haunt of the free and bold spirits that scour the main.' 'In other words, a buccaneer's home, good Balco,' remarked Don Enrique, as he gazed upward at the broken outline of the walls and towers. ' What is it called?' 'The convent of the Three Marys, senor. But here we are round the promontory and open upon the west side. We now run into this lit- tle bay along the eape for half a mile, when we shall come to the opening of a creek or little in- let, iup which we have to go about a mile, when we shall reach the hamlet I spoke of.' They now rowed round the dark cone of the cape, and steering due south, keeping close to the shore, at length came in sight of a gap in the ridge, which seemed cleft to the water by some convulsion of the earth. Balco pointing this out, said it was the opening through which the inlet flowed up into the bosom of the land. 'But hark'! I bear voices,' cried Don En- rique, at the same time giving his men orders to cease rowing, while Balco also stopped advancing. ' It is a song some fisherman is singing on board his craft, or at the door of his hut,' ob- served the lieutenant. ' There are several crafts ahead, also,' said the captain, whose, keen eye had detected three small vessels at anchor opposite the mouth of the inlet. ' And see! hauled close under the cliff is a large lugger l' I 'I see her,' said Balco, in a cautious tone.   'That vessel can belong to no fisherman. It looks more like one of the old time craft,' he added to himself. ' That fellow sings as if he were in love. Hear him I' Clear and full as a bugle, the strange voice rose and fell upon the evening air with romantic effect. The maiden attentively listened, and caught these words: 'Brave land of Catalunia, Of thee I love to sing; But better far, of my bright star Maria del Quebeso. , Maria with her raven hair, Maria with-'her eyes of jet; Fairest maid of all the glade Is Maria of Quebeso. Brave land of Catalunia, Land of the brave and fair; I love thy mountains tall, I love thy green woods all; I love thy skies of summer blue, I love thy seas of purple hue, But better far, I love my star Maria del Quebeso.' 'By the rood!' said Don Enrique, the fellow sings well; and is no doubt an honest-hearted Catalan, who has left his lady-love behind him- some nut-brown milkmaid, in the dells of Cata- lunia-and now consoles himself for his absence by singing her praises to the moon.' 'I will pull on and see what the schooner proves to be,' said Balco. ' If it is as I suspect, there is no need to turn back.'. ' Turn back, not I I' answered Don Enrique; ' are we not enough to capture her, if need be? and which I am half inclined to recommend; for I have little relish for the hospitality of these fishermen you talk of.' The soDg, a third stanza of which had been opened by the singer, suddenly ceased, and a voice challenged sternly: ' Quien va-la?' 'Amigos,' responded Baleco, who was in ad- vance slowly rowing on. ' We are shipwrecked persons and seek shelter.'       ' Keep where you are, or we shall fire into you,' said the same voice; and at the same   time there was seen the glare of a light on board, and heard the sound of feet and words, as. if there was no little sensation produced in the vessel, by the approaeh of two boats filled with strangers. ' We are friends,' answered Balco, in Span- ish; and perhaps have more to fear from you than you from us!'. ' You must not come alongside,' responded the person who spoke from the lugger, in a de. cided tone. ' We have no desire to board you, fair oomi rade,' answered Balco, ' but only to row into the inlet.' The boats then kept on steering a little to the left, and in shore of the lugger, the fore- castle of which, as they passed it, was crowded with a dark mass of men, the moonlight flashing upon the steel-headed pikes and cutlasses with which they were armed. ' This looks as if the same old ways were practised in these waters and shores,' muttered Balco, to himself. ' I shall find plenty of mate- rial here, if I turn to the roving life again. Steady, men--not so fast-there are rocks here- about.' ' The boats soon passed the schooner, neither party exchanging another word, but eyeing one another with a hostile and cautious manner, and came to the entrance of the inlet over which beetled a tall rock crowned with a group of co- coa trees, and a single palm, the umbrella-like top of which, rising high into the sky, was silver- ed by the moonbeams. ' This place is dark enough you are leading us into,' said Don Enrique. ' We may get into a net; no doubt that lugger belongso the free brotherhood,and this is their haunt;' and they look on-us now with -little favor I' ' I do not fear it, senor. If you will trust to me, I will be answerable for the safety of all.' ' Advance then, in the name of all the saints; for I am desirous of touching the firm ground with my heel once more 1' The, creek was less than fifty yards in width, but with nice steering was navigable for vessels iof a hundred tons.  It narrowed as they  as  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7455-00000009"/> cended, and the banks, at first high and casting dark shadows upon the water, became lower, till at length they were rowing along through an open meadow, over which hung a thin fog which glistened in the moonbeams like floating snow. Above this veil they soon saw a grove of trees with a high hill rising in the rear, and beyond, glimpses of the open country. The sea was no longer visible. The inlet was very serpentine, for the moon which had been on their left when they entered it, had gradually worked round till it was behind them. ' This creek, Baleo, is as crooked as an ana- conda's trail which it musthave been originally,' said Don Enrique; ' we seem to be going back again to the sea-shore.' 'We are full a mile from it, senor I Yonder grove conceals the hamlet I spoke of. From the hill above it is a lookout, that commands the ocean, as well as the view many leagues inland. We had best keep our arms ready, in case we should find enemies here; but I think we shall be likely to meet with a hospitable rece -ion.' ' Yes, arms are likely to come in play, hem- med in as we are by the lugger's crew astern, and this haunt of robbers, for what we know, in 'advance. There is a boat ahead I' As he spoke, a small piroque which had been slowly moving on above them was overtaken. It contained a single occupant-a mere lad- who, instead of taking alarm at the approach of the boats, rather slacked his paddling and wait- ed for them. But when he could see plainly the dress and appearance of the party he uttered a shrill cry, and sent his boat ahead with the velocity of an arrow, and tried to escape. ' You need not fear, lad. No one will harm thee,' called out Balco. ' We are friends, and not foes 1' The lad, however, did not heed his words, but darting among the bushes and reeds that lined the bank, leaped on shore like a fawn and disappeared in the darkness. In a few moments longer, they came into a sort of basin of still water, on one side of which rose a cliff, and on the other was a level space overshadowed by   palm trees, and containing a score of fishermen's cabins. (Here we are, at last,' said the lieutenant, as he ran his boat into the land. ' It seems nearly deserted. But we can make ourselves at home.' ' It is secluded enough, and a fair retreat for gentlemen of the old craft, Don Pe-, I mean good Baleo,' answered Don Enrique, as follow- ing the example of the lieutenant, he steered his boat to the shore. The whole party now landed, consisting of thirty-six men in all. Balco, with the familiar step of an old resident, advanced to the nighest hut, striking back with his cutlass a host of fierce dogs that, roused by their landing, set upon them with a loud baying. Don Enrique ordered his men to collect dry branches, and with the aid of a pistol snapped into the crisp leaves, they soon had a fire kindled, which cast a- wild red light over the scene. The place consisted of a miserable village of huts, constaected of cane, and roofed- with the broad leaves of the palm; habitations such .as the Afrioans on the island chiefly inhabited, but which the poverty of the simple Spanish fisher- men did not disdain. Paths crossed from one door to the other as if the occupants were social in their habits. Save an aged man, with a beard is white as the driven snow, who came forth from the larger hut to see who had arrived, no one was visible. On seeing this man, Balco advanced towards him, and looking fixedly upon him seemed to recognize him. 'What I is it thee, Felipe?' he cried with animation; ' how fares it with thee?' The old man started with surprise, and said: ' I know that voice-but it is one that I have perhaps heard in dreams-for I dream a good deal now I am old I Who is it? I cannot see thee well, son, for my sight is dim.' ' That I know thee, old Felipe, is enough. I did not expect to find thee alive. Wilt thou give us welcome?' v ' We have roofs, and they shall cover thee and thine, but we have no food I Our people these days have to go many   a league to leeward to fish farther than when I was a lad. ' But who   art thou? But it matters not. If thou art friends, thou. maayst stay; if thou art enemies, thou wouldst stay. We are but poorfishers, and the victims of the strong.' Don Enrique now stationed guards by the boats, and sentries about the hamlet, to guard against surprise, and ordered the rest of the men to lie down in the huts; for they were well worn out with rowing so far. He then placed the maiden in one of the cabins, and bade her seek the repose she needed; while he and Don Pelayo walked apart. 'Now, worthy Baleo,' said Don Enrique, always speaking in a tone of superiority, not the , superiority so much of a captain over a lieuten- ant, but of a noble above an inferior person; ' having landed in safety, it becomes necessary that I come to some decision as to my future course. How far, say you, is it to the Havana from this place V' 'Not less than eighty miles by water, and sixty by the road.'           . ' There is a road then--the saints be thanked!' ' Yes, and one which leads. through some of the fairest scenes of the island, bordered on one side by coffee estates, and on the other by the sea.' 'That is good news. Now it will not be difficult for me to obtain a couple of horses at - one of these estates you speak of?' ' Not more than a league and a half'from hence, is the village of San Isidro--a place with ' an inn, and a few   artizans' houses. You will there, for gold, get what you like.' ' Then I stay not long with you, Balco. But of thy gold?- Hast thou forgotten it?' ' No, senor captain. It is not far from here that I hid the twenty thousandpesos I spoke of to you. As I said, one quarter of it is thine, whether I get the schooner or no!' 'The schooner will never be more seen by thee or me, worthy Balco. If I take thy money it shall be as a loan, till the better times I look for soon, will enable me to repay thee!' 'I hope thy better time will come for thy sake, senor. I wish thee well, with all my heart. I have said I owe thee gratitude, and let my grat- 2   itude pay itself in part, with what I would place in thy hands.'         . ' I have done naught for thee or thine, Baloo. Thy generosity would gild thy gift under the fiction that I have deserved this money of thee.' 'Nay, senor, but thou dost. Afte I had fled to Spain, from the pursuit which was made after me, I settled in Arragon, the land, from which my mother came-' ' And my own native province!' 'The same where thy fathers reigned nobles, senor captain. I dwelt securely in the village of Valrico, under the name of Basco, and there married my   cousin, a beautiful Arragonese maiden.  At length, after fifteen years of, hp- piness, the war of the Carlist revolution broke out; andI took arms in defence of the rights of Spain. 'I was wounded in the battle of Cor- rientes, taken prisoner, and cast into a dungeon. My home was invaded, and my wife and children driven into the forests. They would have pert ished, but for a youthful noble., a mere lad of seventeen, to whose castle pertained the domain of forest. He went forth with his retainers, seeking those whom he had heard were secreted there, to escape the indiscriminate sword of the lawless foe, and for several months his ocstle became the asylum  of more than eighty families of the valley. Among these was my own. At length I escaped from prison, and at the same time, a truce of three years having been arrang- ed, my family returned home, and I embraced them again upon my own threshold. When I learned from them, as they related it with tears of gratitude, how they had been protected, I also shed tears of thankfulness, and only the necessity of immediately providing for the sub- sistence of my dear wife and little ones prevent- ed me from seeking my benefactor, and pouring out my grateful feelings at his feet. At length, when I  was enabled to find thb time, I learned that he had been seized by Prince Carlos, for aiding the enemy, and was in a dungeon on the sea-shore of Granada. I was unable to aid him, and commending him to the virgin and saints, 1 sadly went about my affairs.  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7455-00000010"/> 'At- length the truce ended, the civil war broke out with more violence than before:. The valley was laid waste; and I was left for dead on the hearth of my:6wn home, defending it against the assassins of Don Carlos. When, at length, I was restored to consciousness, I found my house burned to the ground, and all I loved charred corpses in the smouldering ruins of my habitation. ' I will pass over an account of my terrible emotions, and the fierce vengeance I swore. For'nearly two years I walked Spain with a bloody sword. More than three hundred Car- lists, one at the time, by night, by day, in the cityby-ways, in the forest paths, on land, on the water, fell by my hand. I avenged my mur. dered ones. At length pursued, marked, hunt- ed byfifty bands, I could no longer remain on the land; and having with a few true friends captured a 0arlist vessel, I scoured the coast, doing all the injury in my power to the Carlist party. One day I was on shore at an inn, the host of which was my friend. I had but seven of my men left, the rest having fallen in many a forage. Here I learned that a young noble, flying' from the rage of Don Carlos, had just purchased a Sioilian schooner, and was seeking officers and men. I heard the name, and at once recognized it as that of my benefactor. I at once resolved to offer him my aid, and that of thei retnnant of my crew. At first he refused me-;'   'Santa Maria, good Baleo, I have seen plain. ly that thou art speaking of me all this while. WaB thy wife and children among. those I saved? Beshrew me, there were so many of them I scarce asked their names. Yet there- was one, tall, and dark-eyed, with four boys and a lovely little girl; the child's name I recollect was Francesca l' 'It was my child, senor.  That was her mother,' answered Balco, with a tremulous voice; and Don Enrique saw him place the back of his hand -to both eyes, as if he were wiping away tears. 'They, beautiful as they were--were basely murdered!    But I have avenged them. I slew with this hand every man engaged in the massacre, save one, the chief; whom I pray the saints I niay one day meet. When I heard from the inn-keeper, that thou hadst escaped from the hands of Don Car- los and needed aid, I offered myself to thee. I did not forget gratitude, senor; and before I told thee what I owed thee, I wished to show my gratitude by 'doing thee some great service. But such opportunity has not come, and now I have told thee who I am; and here on my knees I kiss my hands, and bless thee for what thou hast done for me and mine.'   CHAPTER III. 'A deep conspiracy is aIfoot, I see, sirs/.   4. wIAP ,  Balco, nay, brave Don Pelayo,' JS3,^ cried Enrique, raising the grateful husbandnd d father to his feet. ' But gratitude will find words or acts, noble Don Enrique; and as I could not show it to my satisfaction in deeds, I must needs thank thee. They are no more, but I cherish them, and while they live in my memory, I shall re- member to whom I once owed their life.' ' I now remember your beautiful wife well. She- seemed a very princess in her air I' ' Yes; and wilt thou know the secret of the last fierce attack upon my house? The rarb beauty of my wife, while she was yet a maiden, captivated the fiend who afterwards destroyed her with my home. We were rivals, and he never forgave me or herI But if, he,be alive on the earth, good saint Mark will bring me across his path. Now, Senor Don Enrique, thou seest why I offered my services to thee in thy extremity, .when thou ouldt flee. from Spain.',                r ' And thy very eagerness made me suspect   thee to be a secret agent. of Don Carlos; but there was a sincerity in thy looks that gave me confidence in thee; and thou wert also well spoken of to me by the host at the inn; a mad who had been a retainer, of my father '  ! ' Thou hast confidence in me now?' 'Yes.' 'Thou wilt let me give thee a part of the gold-half, if thou wishest it?' 'I will take the five thousand pesos. If I need more.-' ' Come to me, senor 1'. And whee shall I find thee? not here play- ing the simple fisherman I' 'No. I hato a strong desire to follow my old ways again I With the grave of my family, perished all my better feelings. I am at war once more with my species.' e' Wilt thou become a buceanber agdain ' Yes, but only against the rich ships of Mex ico, that do, by their gold, only ilmporlsh and- weaken Spain. But-for her repletion of ;iiler she would not be iii the it rrank of' nations,  &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7455-00000011"/> instead of the lowest; torn inwardly by civil factions, and depending for her strength and glory upon this her colony of Cuba.' ' Not to be her colony long, Balco,' answered Don Enrique, with peculiar emphasis. ' The wedge is out and shaped, that is to split her off from the mother land!' ' What is it you say, Don Enrique T' 'You seem surprised. But I can explain my words no further at present. Not many weeks hence, the secret will be no more a secret! I would trust thee, Balco; but I dae not en- trust it to my own lips to tell it to the, air. But believe me, we are friends, and that if, or may be, I shall want thee, I will let thee know!' ' Depend upon me, Don Enrique,' answered the lieutenant, with fervor. 'So that I have action enough to keep me from thinking of the past, I care not in what emprise I engage.' ',But thou must have a vessel! Will not the schooner at the mouth of the inlet suit thee?' 'No, it is but a lugger-a. pirates' shore craft, that can only skulk from headland to headland. But I mean to see who commnnds her. It can't be but that some of my former comirades are yet to be found.' 4 Thou hast at least recognized one.' ' Felipe? Yes. He was in his day a famous pilot as will as fisherman. He has piloted more than one rieb argosy amiss through the banks, for my benefit, venerable and innocent as he looks now! Ah, your gray beard and white looks, senor, is a fair whitewash for a wicked Ife.' ' And yet he looks a very patriarch! But it is time I was on my way to the, city. Every moment's delay will be fitial to my purposes. Who can guide me to the village V' -  - Harlk! There is a oamonrdiat on the sea! You ascend the hill whiachoverlooks it, and see if the ship is visible, while I go, and tnd.'out who commands the lugger. '* Itii'strkes me if she can -be hired it will- be best for. you to lo to, the Havana in her I! Anld if-not, you can be onpveyeda-there in a fishing shallop, i. ' Tru . I [ ll abandon the idea of the land route, which may prove difficult for me to effeot,   ignorant as I am of the way. But where- is our gold mine, good Baleo?' ' It will take daylight for me to recognize the spot, senor; so .you had best wait patiently till then, and get rest.' ' I will see what this firing is, and then seek repose.' 'The maiden whom you left in the hut, is she thy wife, Don Enrique?' ' Thou art inquisitive, BaIco,' answered Don Enrique, frowning. ' Thy-gratitude to me does not give thee claim to pry too closely into my secrets.' ' Pardon, senor; but were she thy Wife, and  I should ever know her to be in peril, I would aid her, for thy sake, and what thou didst for mine, with my life!' 'If she is in peril ever, and thou canst aid her, do so, Balco, whether thou art sure if she be my wife or no! Thou art sharp-eyed to have discovered Garcilaso to be a woman!' He who hath looked much into woman's eyes, like a husband and father of a fair daughter as I have, senor, can't be deceived, or blinded by any disguise. Every glance of the boy when it is turned upon you, is the glance of a woman, and beams with a woman's tenderness and love. She is very lovely, and I know thou art worthy of her, and I believe too honorable to do her wrong! :' Prythee, worthy Don  Pelayo,' go on thy mission to this'lugger, and see what thou canst effect there I The firing is increasing, and I think the frigate mist have fallen in-with some- thing besides the Bel Isabel.' The two men parted, the one to ascend the cliff, the other 'to return to the huts. Here Bailo fousnd dverything quiet and secure.. aThe seamen who had been stationed as sentries paced up and down witlh drawn cutlasses ; and no one W triy ovmg ,save Coco; who no sooner saw the lieutenant, than he rose from the embers of the fire' over'which he had been crauching drying his lothes, anls c'am' towards him. ' That you, Coco?' demanded the officer. '  oYoes, masro Balco, dat me!'   ' Have you heard any noise? .Have any of the people been here from belowSV' ,A ; ' I see a piroque little bit 'go, come up and turn round and go; down de inlet,? dat's all, massa.' ' I must see these people at once; or they mayplot mischief,' said Balco, to himself V 'Here, Coco, get into this boat with me, and pull down the creek! Quick-I -have not a moment to delayl' Leaving the bank, the boat soon shot out from the hamlet, and moved swiftly down. in the di- rection of the sea., Balco had gone. but half the distance, when on turning a point in the winding branch, he came suddenly, full upon seven boats, small and large, more or less filled 'with men. It was too late for him to. rgcede, and with the courage of a man whose life had been so adventurous as his, he boldly chal- lenged: ' Quienes van? Who goes there?' 'And you?' demanded one in the leading boat, while the click of ,pistols and the clang- ing of steel was heard.    . ' I amra friend and comrade. I seek thecap- tain of the lugger., ' Thou hast found him? , Come alongside?' was the response and comuand.  'A torch' ' Baico bade Coco to, pull to the boat, which with all the rest had, ceased rowing; for when he met them the whole flotilla was ascending the stream with muffled oars. The torch which had beein ordered, was in- stantly in a blaze, being a, bundle of resinous fibres tied on the extremity of a long pole, which was held upright by a man. The light shining brightly upon the whole party, exhibited not only Baeco in full relief to their eyes, but to his a motley group of men -some with red caps, some with  broad sombreros, some. with bare heads; and all with arms of some aort, rblunder-: -busses, pistols, ocutlasses ..or pikes.  Many of them wore scarlet jackets, a few wore white. frooks, and halfo a dozendisplayed, the naked, brawny shoulders of athletae. Every face was ferocious.            . This was a-sight not' altogether new to the   'lieutenant, who, standing up 'in his boat and baring his gray head, -throw back his flowig locks and surveyed them with an air of com- mand. The captain of the party, who also rose to his feet, seemed to. be silenced by the cool and commnanding bearing of this singular man amid a host of foes. ' You do not know me, my friendse ' said Balco, after standing. bare-browed before them, and permitting,every eye to scan his face. ' Is this the way you welcome an old friend, and comarada?. What, Bastano? dost' thou not recal my features?  How, Gonzales, hast thou forgotten me? And thou, Pedro Alvados, who I see conmanding these gentlelnen of the free flag and salute as captain; is it that I am so changed with twenty years' wear and toil ye can- not call me by name?' These words were addressed to here and there an individual in the boats,. and lastly to the leader, who was tall, thin, Spanishooking, with a bald head, and huge gray mustaches and whiskers, a man full Balco's age. At the lieu- tenant's words, which set every eye in Active Mnotion to look at him, and brought to every face an eager expression of keen' curiosity, many of the men fairly rising in their seats to lean to- wards him, the captain bent upon him a' pene- trating glance which gradually brightened up into half-recognition. 'What! By the saints, no   Yet it must be? art thou Don Pelayo?' 'Ay? it is the brave admiral!' shouted in- stantly an old gri l'bearded pirate, who had been addressed as Bastano; and he brandished his cutlass in fierce delight, while he pointed out Baloo to his less favored comrades 1' 'SqnDWiablo   That, is Captain Pelayo,' swore another hoary-headed buccaneer, whom IBaloo had called Oonzales; 'see, coirael 1 thats is the grand capitan I the immortal Pelayo I Hast thou not' heard of Pelayo,.the scourge of the gulf?

'We bielieved thee dead!' ' That it was not so, thou seest- and hearest!' ' And was itthee, who passed us in the bioth: of the inlet?' demanded Captain Pedro. ' Yes, for we had lost our vessel, I and my fiends, and came In for shelter. I did not know thou wert on board; but I guessed it was caraft of the brotherhood, and having placed my party in security, after hard roting, at the lhailet, I came down  to see t'io iof my old fiens I might find i'n the luggiJr. i h ardbly expeted to finAdithee, Pedro, my old leutjnai, and these other' brave'fellows  ' Where haft thou been this core of yeaM, denor admiral, for so we used to csh thee, in thib gOd old'times, before war-steatezs fitfed the   e",; when thou didst command a score of ves- sels and a thousand true'men i' 'I have. been in Spain; Pedro..

' Whither were you rowing in such silence, when- I met ou?' asked Don Pelayo of the captai . - '  ' To tell you truth, we were going to attack you. After you passed us and entered the in- let, it occurred to me that you had robbed some 'hip, and had spoil enough in your ,boats to re. pay us; and this' suspicion' was confirmed by a lad Mozo, who fell in with you up above here, anid reported he overheard you talking about where to secret large sums of money. So, our purpose was- to rob you/, of what we took it for granted you had robbed others, especially as we did not know you as any of our party.' ' Iam glad I met you, Pedro. You would- have fouind little gold, be assured of that. But send your people back to their lugger and come with me, andawe will talk upon subjects that will interest us both        - ' The men are under thy command, senor,' answered -Pedro; ' order them or' me as you will; weolbey.'?    , '* Nay, - Ishall not take thy power from thee; thou art as good a chief, ay, better than they could ihave in me.

'Don Pedro consented to this, and getting into the boat ith Don Pelayo, he commanded the fleWt of boats to'retUm; wlhich they did do aftr giving a 'heaity haiia to Don Pelayo, 'and ex- acting a promise from him, that he would come -and see them on bo6d the lugger in the morn- ing.   ' ow, aback again, Coco!' said Balco, as the tall, buccaneer chief seated himself in the stem sheets of the boat, with the confidential seourity of an old friend. ',By the mass, Don Pelayo, but this is a strange meeting to-night with thee,' saidhe; ' you seemed to fall from the skies. Twenty years you have not been heard of, and yet, here we are once more both alive and well. Wast thou shipwrecked, truly?' 'Nay.  I know I can confide in thee I' ' The secret on which might hang thy life.' ' I have no such secret as that; for doubtless ere this, the authorities of. Cuba have forgotten me, and the reward held over my head, long sinee withdrawn.' ' Yes. I have not heard thy name in ffteen years, save in the wild tales that pas ",from mouth to mouth among my men, who talk of thee as if thou wert some valiant hero, who lived in ,the days of the Cid, a thousand years ago. This firing outside I heard to-night, had some- thing to do with thy coming into the land, I'll be sworn, Don Pelayo.  Hark! there is more of it, in the western board '  Don Pelayo laughed as he paused to listen for a moment to a renewed heavy firing, which seemed to be at least six miles down" the iCoast, in the direction of Matanzas. ' That is a frigate, I suspect, firing at, a tar- get l' ' How isthat? I have seen a large ship half the day becalmed in the eastern board. Is it a frigate?  'You shall hear..   That frigate chased a schooner in* which I left the straits twenty-four days ago up to this cape. At length,she: ame near capturing us, and we deserted the sehooner, which stood on alone, and, the, frigate: dloSe at her heels, while we got safely in under thd lead Unseen. I lighted a fuse to burn her, sat that she: should not fall into the enemy'sl hands; but it went ou01, and; the vessel is doubttless :now sailing before the wind:; without officerdor drew, and the frigate in full chase cannonading.'  ' It is a pity to lose a fine vessel, Ibut bettet to save thyself, Don Pelayo.

' And why does she pursue you? . Have you been at the, old occupation in, the Mediterr nean?' ' No, not exactly. You see I was too .well known, after aertain exploits in the Carlist wars to feel secure on land; so X took .to the ,blue water; but I was poor, had a small lateeg boat and few men, and I cruised only against Carlists, At length, I fell in with an Arragonese noble, who was escaping from a Carlist prison., ., H had bought a Sicilian- schooner, and needed a lieutenant. I found that, instead of being at stranger; he-had befriended mwe so greatly,once, as to save my wife and ,children from death I' 'Thou awife and children, Don Pelayo?' demanded the sallow-eomplexioned buccaneer chief, with surprise.;  'Yes. In Spaint  I married and reared a sweet family, Pedro. But they ari now gone l' Here -Don Pelayo beeame silent, and for'a, few moments no sound was heard but the dipping of the oars of the ,slave, as he Clipped the!olear stream with the edges of their sharp ,blades, ' But let that pass,' the old man said thi0kly. ' They are in heaven now I I have avenged them.

We nearly rolled our, masts out without any canvass to steady lier; but after a while we got blown far ahead of: the frigate, till shee was, no longer visible. We then'set sail again and run for it, but at sunrise she was a league astern, cracking on every stitch of canvass in chase. At length we got in sight of- St. Salvador, run downthe Bahamas, and yesterday morning came in sight of Cuba.  At noon we were -biealmed three: mres apart; but towards night, she got a royal breeze, while it was dead calm on deck, and walked up to us so fast, that seeing she wt6ild capture us, the captain ordered the schoon- er to .be deserted for the boats,' and set on fire * but as I told you, the fuse weftt out, and .the last we saw of the Bel Isabel she was standing under a breeze that caught her after we left her, on iW west nor-west course, and with as steady a keel, as if the best pilot in Cuba were at her hebmi . There goes another heavy gun from the frigate in chase V1'  - Don Pedro showed his pleasure at the idea of a frigate chasing a crewless vesselwith a heavy  bmbardmenbt by a grim smile, and then asked quickly: CspQerO  de Paulo I  What was this long Ind steady chase for? What had thye captaindone?' Doh ;Pelayo shrugged' his :shoulders, and an- swered; naively.  Quien sabes, Hee hid- escaped from, Don Carlos-maybe, he wanted him back again.' ; '.That e6uldiairdly have been a sufficient: re.   T son for such a persevering pursuit! There niust be something more. Where is thy noble captain?'     ; ' Thou shalt see him! He is at the hamlet. He wishes to reach Havana as soon as may be. If you will tell him you will take him hither in the lugger, it will gratify him.' ; 'The lugger is at thy service, Don Pelayo,' responded he buccaneer, promptly. ' But it is too well known, as well as its master, to show its nose in port. But I can run to the beach to the east of the Moro Castle u mile, and from thence, he can take a piroque round under the castle, or cross on foot by the rear of the walls, and be ferried over to the city.' ' This will do. Here we are at the hamlet. After he has departed, I will talk with thee, of my own matters and thine!' The boat now reached the shore, and both men stepped upon; the bank and took their way to a  hut which Don Pedro said he oecupied when on shore. It stood 'a little apart from the others, on the verge of the water shaded:by a palm tree. Upon entering, the buccaneer struck a light, which showed the interior of the 'cabin, which contained no other furniture than a bench, two cane-stools, a heavy ship's table, -and a few articles *of crockery. Against the wall were three berths arranged, as on ship board. An old sail lay in one corner, and a pair of oars, a boat- hook, three fish-spears and some fishing tackle were' in the corner.  The floor was strewn with rushes. The lamp whioh lighted the hut was an iron dipper half filled with the blubber of fish, and containing a piece of *rope yarn for a wick. It was plain, that with all their plundered wealth, the pirates of Cuba expended none of it in lux- uries, or. in increasing the comforts of life. ' You have, a rough place here, Don Pedro;, said Balco, looking round, before taking a seat. ' 'Yes, I am here but little; and besides -it is a  place where those who would like to make my acquaintane more intimately than  I desire, would find it difficult to find me!; Will 'ysu en- ter on the old business, senor- admiral?' asked Don Pedro, as he lighted a fragrant cigar at the lamp.   'I have nothing else to do; but I will find a vessel of my own.'  ' But you will be our chief?' 'Dost wish it from thy heart, Pedro? for if not, I don't desire to stand in thy way. Thou art head now!' ' But thy head is wiser than mine. I will do well enough to command one vessel and fight her;. but when, it comes to a fleet (for now you have come up from the dead as it were, we shall have a fleet), I give it into your hands.' ' How many vessels are there under your direction?' asked Balco, filling a cup with red wine, .which Captain Pedro placed before him. 'Ah, this wine is the true Bordeaux.' ' It ought to be, senor; for I took it from a Bordeaux ship, and more from the captain's own private stores. As to the number, let me see! There is the Colombo, a sloop of thirty tons, and twenty men, that aruises about the isle of pines. There is the Pinta of sixty tons, and thirty men, that has the strait between Cape St. Antonio and the Florida Cape! This ves- sel is commanded by Santander, whom you re- collect. fae  there is the Christophe with six- teen men, aa twenty tons, that haunts the Ba- hamases, under the guise of a wrecker. How many is this?' demanded Don Pedro, enumerat- ing on his fingers. 'Four!' ' Good. There is one more--the Fernando- a schooner of ninety tons, and sh% cruises in the gulf, and hasher rendezvous at the Isle of Pines, , iwhich is our general meeting-place twice in a year.' 'You have given a good tale, Don Pedro. This is better than I hoped for,' said Pelayo, his eyes brightening up. Ay, ay! We will soon have a fleet in service, as formidable as ever!' 'But los diablos steam-ships, Don Pelayo. One of those English craft or Yankee ones, going twenty miles an hour against wind or tide, gives otvessels but poor chance.  In- stead of venturig openly in the blue sea as we used to do, we hardly dare go' off soundings;   and then, however clear the horizon may be, the first thing we see is a black smoke, black as el inferno, then comes in sight a blacker hull, then we hear a roar like a sea lion, and in ten minutes from first sight of her she is down upon us like a lion upon a lap-dog, ready to take us right up in its mouth and shake us. If we are too far off from the shore to run for it, we are gone. ' So that we can only catch such. vessels as the current or head winds bring-out of their course near the island'; and these chancesa' ad- ded the old buccaneer, shaking his head, 'are but few., We are as poor is Neapolitan beg- gars. I have scarcely seen (he color of gold in five- months; hence we planned our expedition to plunder you!' ' You would have got little, Don Pedro,' an- swered Balco, filling for the third time the cup with the odorous wine. ' Our party is little troubled with coin. Don Enrique, who had just escaped from a prison, could hardly be supposed to bring much gold with him; and as for me, I have not been working in a mine since we last met. As for these steamers-confound them and their smoke-devil's invention as they are, we must get a steamer too I' ' We get a steamboat?' repeated Don Pedro, starting up so quickly as to upset the wine bot- tle, which fortunately was quite emptied; 'a navio de vapor for us 1' 'Yes; it;is the only way we can manage to circumvent our pursuers.  We will play their own game with them!' ' Excelentel  Bueno ' cried the tall, gaunt buccaneer chief, slapping his hand into the palm of Don Pelayo. ' This is a brave idea! But where is the money to come from? They cost diablito!' ' The money we must try and get; and if we, can't buy one, we must try and do better still,' 'How?' . ' Capture one,' answered Don Pelayo, calm- ly.  ' Are there none in the harbor of Havana?' I 'Yes, and well gunned and manned too. We might as well try and take Gipraltero I'  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7455-00000014"/> -'We do not certainly know a thing cannot: be done until it has been tried, Don Pedro.' 'Havana is filled with war-ships. You have heard of the excitement here-but then you are a new-comer?  Diablol We have  stirring times or hand!             ' ' What news is this?' asked Don Pelayo. ' Ah, my brave friend, what hast thou of good and stirring news?' asked a voice at the door of the hut. Both men rose, and Alvados placed his hand on the butt of a pistol at his belt, as he saw a noble-looking young man of lordly height, and the proud air of elevated birth, which com- mands involuntary homage from the lower born, standing in the doorway, and gazing upon them. ' Put back your pistol, Pedro-it is my cap- tain, Don Enrique I' ' Then welcome to my poor cabin, noble sir,' said Don Pedro, with courtesy extending-,his hand; ' I am glad to meet thee as a friend, for my ancient comrade here has given me some ace count of thee, and of your voyage thither.' 'Then I am well introduced, amigos, and there needs no farther parley. I have overheard   something of thy last words together, as I stood in the door before entering, having for sometime been looking round for an unoccupied cabin to lie down in.' ' Thou shalt repose here I There are couches, senor.' 'Grahias, senor. I will accept thy hospital- ity!' 'Where is Gareilaso?' asked Pelayo, in an un- der tone. 'Sleeping in the next cabin, with ^ sentry at her door.' ' Here, senor, is good wine of France. Let me have the honor of quaffing a cup with thee, to thy safe arrival in Cuba.' ' Willingly,' responded the young nobleman, taking in his hand a chased silver goblet which for his use, the buccaneer had abstracted from a chest on which he was seated.  'This is. a rare cup, and befits so rare a beverage.' After they had drunk, Don Enrique, setting down the goblet, once more demanded of the buccaneer chief the nature of the news at which he had hinted.   CHAPTER IV. ,' Sweet moonlight tempts the feet of love- For of moonlight are the beams of Paradise.'   THE buccaneer trimmed the lamp-wick with the point of his dagger, and lighting a fresh cigar at the freshened blaze, thus replied to the inquiry of Don Enrique : 'The news, senor; that I was about to make my friend and Captain Don Pelayo the hearer of, will not be injured by giving it'to other ears, and especially thine, noble captain;. for if thou art free-handed for adventure, the times will cut thee work enough out to do!' 'Out with thy budget, captain. ' I will de- cide, when I hear what the times are,' answered Don Enrique, with a slight frown of impatience. ' Know then, caballeros, that there is great disff'ection in the island against the government in Spain; not only is, but has been long. The people complain that Spain demands too much revenue, as if we were a conquered province paying tribute of half our goods, instead of part and parcel of the same nation sending to her our honest tithes. They complain .that Spain regardiS them as a sort'of bond-slave,' out of which she squeezes as much as she can. Our   planters say that they can't get rich, for the king's collectors rob them on pretenre of filling the royal treasury. Our lawyers say that none but Spanish-born lawyers are made judges over their heads. Our merchants complain of bear- ing duties and burdens that they say should be put upon only a subdued people. In a word, all the native-born Cubans, however rich, noble, learned or powerful they may be, however fitted to take charge of publio affairs, are set aside for cavaliers of the old country, and these rule them with a rod of iron. When, they ask, was ever known a captain general, who was an islander? They complain of having to support a standing army of twelve thousand Spanish troops, who, instead of defending the country against foreign foes, act as spies upon themselves.' 'By the mass! thou hast summed up a host of grievances, Don Pedro,' said Balco, looking at Don Enrique, to watch the effect these revela- tions had upon his captain. \ ! 'Go on-go on-what more do they say?' merely remarked the latter, without changing  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7455-00000015"/> a muscle of his face so that his feelings could be discovered.        ! ' Cuerpo di Bacco! I have something more to say,' answered Don Pedro. ' The people's murmurs have reached the ears-' ' Of the governor-general!' 'No, senor captain, but of the brave, free people of the United States, whose bosoms ever bum with resentful fire, when they hear of the wrongs of the human family. These warlike people who have just conquered Mexico, and carried their eagles to the shores of the Pacific, no sooner hear that a people are oppressed by tyrants, than they are ready to draw the sword in their behalf I' 'They are the enemies of kings-and the scourge of tyrants,' said Balco, with approba- tion. ' What have the Americanos done?' demand- ed Don Enrique, with deepening interest. ' The nation, as a nation, have done nothing yet; but weeks ago there was a rumor rife at Havana, that an army of these heroes was ready to land upon the shores to aid Cubans in throw- ing off the yoke of Spain, whenever they should be invited!' ' anst thou vouch for the truth of this?' -de- manded Don Enrique, with a lkindling eye, half rising. 'I can vouch for the truth of the rumor, senor, but not for the fact; but it is no doubt true, for the captain general has sent a secret mes- senger to the warrior presidente,' informing him of what he has heard, and warning him to abide by the letter of the treaty, and not permit the sailing of this expedition. I was in Havana, when the vessel sailed, for secret as the governor general wished to keep it, every body spoke of i the destination of the vessel, and the affair on which it was dispatched?' ' This is news indeed,' exclaimed Don En- 1 rique, :rising, and pacing quickly to and fro, for E a few minutes, as if deeply moved by the intel-  ligence. ' This is brave nets I And, tell me,  Captain Pedro, is there any movement on the 1 island at large to meet this sympathy on the I part of the brave American citizens '   t   ' That I cannot say, senor.' ' How far to Havana, said you?' ' Eighty miles!' ' Can you take me there in your vessel?' ' Yes, senor, at least I will land you within half a league of the city.' 'Very good-that will do. When can you start?' ' To-night, if you say.' ' Don Pelayo, touching our funds-can that be possibly arranged to-night?' he asked, in an under tone. ' No, senor; I must have day light to notice the land marks.' ' Very well, I must wait. Don Pedro, I am glad to hear this news. I was not prepared for this movement so soon.  How stands the coun- -try about here? are they loyal?  Will they join an invasion?' ' That will depend on its strength. If ten thousand men land from the States, I believe the whole island would rise; but if a small force only appears, few will dare to move in the mat- ter; for failure would be ruin. The Americans if they come, must come with force enough to cope with the Spanish army; that defeated, the yoke of the island would be east off in a day.' ' Hast thou heard the name of any Cuban of note mentioned in connection with this proposed revolution?' asked Don Enrique, with interest, yet seeking -to disguise his curiosity under an appearance of indifference. 'Si, senor. It has been whispered that Nar- ciso Lopez, is in correspondence with the Ameri- can chiefs.'         ' ' Ah, indeed I This enterprise shows bolder and larger at every sentence you utter. Lopez is a strong man,na skilful soldier, and has true courage.  He will -make a good leader, if he be not too rash.  I have seen him in Spain. There he is noted for his daring and gallant conduct in several battles,; but his lion-like courage leads him -often into difficulties. In such a movement as this, Lopez will make a gooa military leader, but :bad counsellor. There should be a 'colder head than his, toplan and direct. By:the rood! thou hast given us good news.'   'If I may ask, senor,' asked Balco; 'what side wilt thou take, if arms are drawn in this matter?' ' That of Cuba against Spain?' answered Don Enrique; 'have I not already sufficiently be- trayed my opinions?' ' So then will I, by saint Pablo I' answered Balco. ' And thou, Pedro?' 'The side that pays best,' answered the buc- caneer, with a smile on his grim features. ' I have no country, and owe allegiance to none; and whatever be the power in Cuba, I am still an outlaw.' 'Keep then in favor with the patriot side, brave don capitan, until thou hearest from me further, as thou wilt do, if this news have but foundation.' 'I will follow the fortunes of Don Pelayo, whatever they may be!' answered the bucca- neer chief. 'Mine, are Don Enrique's,' replied Balco, stoutly. ', Then, my friends, I can confide in you both. As I can't leave till the sun-is up, I will take some repose, with your leave, captain. Be early about thy matter, Balco.' Don Enrique then threw himself clad as he was upon one the berths in the hut, but not before giving orders to Balco, to watch over the cabin where Dona Mariana, reposed. ' I will guard her as if she were my daughter, senor.' The two buccaneers now left the hut together, leaving the young Castilian to seek rest. -Pe- dro went in the direction of the water to visit: the lugger, and prepare her for the next day's ,work; while Baleo drew near to the cabin where Gafrilaso slept. The Spanish sailor was still pacing before it in the moonlight, which gleam- ed on the blade of his cutlass at every turn in his promenade. . -It is near midnight, Juan.; Your watch will soon be up., Is Gareilaso Atill within?' ' No, senor. He left an hour agosaying he would walk a little, the night, wa$ so bright, and the -hut was so close.' .  'I thought the captain- placed you .herte t o   keep guard?' said Don Pelayo, with angry sur- prise. ' I did not know, senor, that it was over Senor Garcilaso, but over all our goods which he placed in this tent. I supposed. the captain's nephew could go and come as he pleased, unless the captain gave him orders to sleep inside with the baggage. The goods are safe.;' and the senti- nel to show the accuracy of hip assertion, threw open the door and exhibited all the articles, bales, boxes and bundles, which the two boats had brought from the schooner when she was 'deserted. 'Well, you are not to blame, Juan; Don ,Enrique doubtless placed you- to watch the goods,' answered Balco, who was not a little troubled at the mysterious absence of the maid- en; for it was now clear to him that his cap- tain had placed Garcilaso in the tent with the parcels, in order to ensure under their guardian- ship of the sentry, her own safety from all intru- sion. His-first impulse, was to return to the hut, awake Don Enrique, and inform him that' she was missing. He then concluded to wait another hour, for probably, long penned up at sea in a small cabin, she took pleasure in walk- ing in freedom over the green sward, beneath the star-lit skies and lighted by the soft radiance of the moon, Having inquired which way she went, and learning it was towards the sea-shore, he resolved to go in that direction, knowing well the dan- ger of the region about this piratical haunt to a single person of either sex. But he knew Gar- cilaso to be a young, and beautiful girl, loved and cherished by Don Enrique, and for his sake he determined to seek her, and persuade her to return to the, more secure shelter of the hut. To. this end, he  took his way along a path which led in the direction of the rooky head- land. After Don Enrique  had conducted the dis- guised maiden into the tent, where he had previously ordered all the valuables to be stored, and audibly entrusted them to her charge, bid- ding her sleep there, with a sentry also at the [door, he remained a few moments seated by her  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7455-00000016"/> side in tlte open door. The moon shone down full upon his noble brow, and lighted up his features with Grecque-like beauty. The sentry had not yet come upon his post. They were alone and unseen. He passed his arm around her zoned waist, and drawing her against his manly heart', impinted kisses warm and num. berless upon her; unresisting lips. tpon her lovely face came the moonlight, through a lat- tice of natural foliage that grew above the door; lighting up bright glimpses of her cheek, fore- head and neck, leaving her dark eyes in darker shadow, but yet with the tender star-beams of love visibly trembling in their depths.. Don Enrique gazed upon the half-iid beauty of her features, seen as it. were througjh silvery net- work, with prideful eyes. ' Thou art very fair, sweet! he said, gently. ' One word of praise from thee, Enrique, yields me a world of joy,' she said, looking up into his face with the confiding bliss of love that knows no cloud in its azure heavens. ' This is a blessed hour, when, without prying eyes, I can unseen fold thee thus to my heart, Mariana.' ' I shall be so happy when I can put off this boy's garb, and resume the proper ,one of my sex. But it is thy command, Enrique!' ' Nay, not my command, love, but safety's. It was expedient at first thou shouldst assume it, and-' 'I will wear it as long as thou wishest, En- rique.' ' On board, I knew not whom to trust; or thou shouldst not have worn it a day after we, quitted the shores of Spain. In two days more, we shall be in Havana, and then thou shalt re- sume thy sex's habit. I want to see thee once more beaming in all thy womanly charms; yet, by the mass, Mariana; thou makest a beautiful boy!' ' When do we go to Havana, and how, En- rique?' ' Soon after sunrise, I hope, if horses can be obtained, for thee and me,' he answered; for when this conversation took place, Don Enrique had not seen the .buccaneer captain, the inter-   viewr with whom, it will be recollected, took place two or three hours afterwards. 'I hope to find the chief persons to whom I have a mis, sion in Havana, ready to report to me that Cuba will be ere long ready to declare her in- dependence!' ' I tremble at the dangers this secret conspi. racy in which you are engaged, will involve you, Don Enrique. I fear it may fail, and then--9 ' Then we must try it again, Mariana. Spain is destined to lose this gem of the Western Ind. You know, for I have repeated them to thee, the wrongs they who are citizens suffer at the hands of the Cortes. Dost thou forget thy mother, Mariana ' ' O, no Enrique; I do not feel otherwise than you do. I am a conspirator with thee for the' glory of Cuba. It was my mother's native land; but her father lost his head in trying to bring about thirty years ago, what you and' your friends in Spain and Cuba would now attempt. But thy dangern akes a coward of me v' ' I know-thou-art as courageous as an eagle, Mariana; and let thy courage nerve me rather than let thy love unnerve thee. I know thou wouldst not have me abandon the glorious pro- ject to which I have committed myself.' 'No, O, no!' she answered earnestly. 'Go forward, and win all that fame and glory hold out to thee; so that I hold the empire of thy heart, I am happy. And if thou diest, I can die with thee, Enrique!' He kissed her forehead where the moonlight fell upon it, and then said: 'This conspiracy is as yet in its infancy. There are but few engaged in it, and these tried men.   I shall soon know who can be trusted in Havana.   Ah, thou knowest, Mariana, what deep wrongs my father and I have suffered at the hands of those who should have honored and protected our rights. Victims both, of a false and  treacherous king; he died broken hearted-,yes, that great heart which had beat- en only for the honor and  majesty of Spain broket I  his was not enough for the royal ty- rant! I, with poor patrimony, the riches of which were melted into the royal' treaury, I   was not suffered to enjoy what had been a little while spared. But the subject makes my blood too warm, we will not talk of it now, with this sweet night about us, inviting and wooing us to happier thoughts. Hither comes the sentry I have ordered to be posted here, ostensibly to guard the goods, but really to keep this sanc- tuary of thy repose free from chance intruders. Here thou mayst rest in :peace, and dream of thy native land.' ' I shall only dream of that which most is in my thoughts, Enrique,' she said with deep emotion, and smiling with tenderness. ' And what is that, love?' he asked, as if .he well knew, yet would gladly hear it from her own bright-lips. 'Thyself, Enrique.  I have no a thought that is not bending round thee as a centre, as the fair planet we see tremulous in the skies ever circles round the sun. Thou art to me the sun and centre of my being-the joy, the hope, the excellency of my life.' 'I should be happy to be thus the object ofso noble a passion, Mariana. Thy deep love fills my soul with both fear and delight.' ' Fear?' she repeated, with a slight accent of surprise and gentle reproof. ' Fear only lest should aught happen to me, that with thy life so interwoven in mine, thou wouldst. die soon an early death-thy  young beauty, like a spring flower half-blown, blighted by an untimely frost.' 'And thou wouldst fear with reason, dearest Enrique. Have I not told thee, that I cannot survive thee j Welcome death, when the earth no longer holds thee. My love will follow thee into the darkness of the grave, as the fair star Hesperus ever follows the sun as he goes down the west into the illuminable night!' ' Good night, dear star of love'! I will be thy sun, to light and guide and bless thee ever,' he said, with a certain tender Inanliness, as he drew her to his bosom ' It is time  we part now, for I must see:about the movements of. to- morrow, and Balco waits tto!dw discourse with me. He will chide my dallying. Sleep, to be   ready to take saddle with me early.  Good Lnight!' The sentry now came to the door, and bon Enrique stealing a kiss, tore himself from her, or rather unwound her arms. from him as the forester uncoils the vine that clasps the monarch oak. ' A fair night, Senor Garcilaso,' said the sen, try, who was one of Balco's seamen.  It is pleasant again to be on the land for a few hours  though, by the beard of San Barcarra, I would not care to live always on the shore I' 'What saidst thou, good   fellow?  asked Mariana, starting from a reverie, and turning her eyes from following Don Enrique's retiring form, as he went to walk aside and talk, as we have seen, with Don Pelayo.  ' I was not lis- tening; pardon me?' The man repeated word for word his remarks, and the maiden re-collecting her thoughts, an, swered as she could, but not to the purpose. ' Yes, the green earth is lovely, and the sea terrible I I feel thankful to the holy virgin, for having brought us safely here.' ' I don't think much here or there, senor, of the safety you speak of here; for it seems to me, to be rather a buccaneering rendezvous we have got into. But then we can fight twice our num- ber if we are attacked. Dost thou think the Bel Isabel has blown up yet?' ' I hope not. I feel an affection for the ves, sel where I have passed so many happy hours.' ' Happy? Hei! With a frigate in chase of us for three weeks, and half the time popping her shot into us; I don't know whA your ideas of happiness are, Don Garcilaso, but if this is their complexion, they differ from mine! Thou art the eaptain's nephew I Dost thou know what our next move is?' ' He will try and reach the city to-morrow; andBalco will obtain another vessel as soon as he can; in the meanwhile, doubtless, the Isabel's crew will remain here I' 'Yes, if these people will let us. But, we will see l' ' Good night, Turilo, I am sleepy, and will lie down.'  &#xD;<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7455-00000017"/> ' I am sleepy, too, sleepy as a mole, but if I lay down, I shall be' shot with a bullet from' one of Lieutenant Baleo's pistols through my head. See what itis,f added the sentry with a good- natured smile, ' to be nephew to the captain. It is to do as one likes; to wake up if one is in the wakeful mood; tdlie down and snore if one is in the lying down and snoring mood, which I am at this very moment. What, hast thou gone in and shut the door? Adios, and a good night to thee, fair senor. By the- red bull of Toledo! were I to have the fixing of my for- tune ever in life, I would be nephew to a cap- tain, and his private secretario, like this hand- some Don Gareilaso, who, to say the truth, is a true and proper gentleman, if he has no beard, and one of these days he'll play the deuce among the senoras with his fine eyes. Ah, Santo Diablo! What have we here? What animal of the island is this?- It neither comes on its feet nor hands, but rolls along like a ball. Hold, there! Quien va!' The object which thus drew the attention of the sentry from presenting the appearance of a shapeless heap rolling along the ground, now rose erect and revealed to him "the form of a dwarf, of a dark, mahogany complexion, and long, black hair, flowing down his back, a long nose with large black eyes. He stepped within two yards of the sentry and remained fixed, looking steadily at him. ' Is that the way people walk in this island, friend, and are they all made in thy fashion and pattern?' demanded Turilo, partly in earnest, partly in derison; for, though perplexed at the apiparition, he was not frightened, ' A man is not judged by his skin, nor by his boeines, nor by the feet he measures from the ground upwards, nor by the straithess of his spine, friend; but by the soul and the acts he does,' answered the dwarf, in a quiet manner and -voice of singular sweetness of cadence. ' BMnedicite!' but thou art half right, be thou diablo or hombre, saint or sinner. "Thou couldst not have made better answer in thy defence; for; 9 marry, thou hast need to say somewhat ins that way, for thy looks we marvellously a gaif#t-hee,   so well as I can see thee by this moonlight. Dost thou come from the moon or the sea? from the ground or the air?' ; From the ground like thyself, and all who dwell on earth.' ' I' faith, but thou speakest like a theologican, and seeing thou quotest scripture, thou canst not be the devil; so I will talk with thee without fear. But how is it thy voice is so opposite to thy outer man, good sir dwarf? It is as if a bassoon had stolen the lute's key and discoursed in masquerade. By thy visage and form, one would look for thee to grunt like a hog, or howl like a bear; but Maria! instead, you ha'e the throat of a singing girl. Nay, don't come near- er ; for though I will hold converse with thee at six feet pace, I want thee no nigher!' And Turilo presented the point of his cutlass in a menacing manner. The dwarf smiled, and threw his hand out with a gesture of proud disdain. Turilo saw that it was as:small as a high-born lady's, 'and that it was jewelled; for the moonbeams flashed from it with the brightness of blazing diamonds. ' Dost thou fear me? Are none to be feared but the deformed? Is outward ugliness the sign of wickedness?  If thou wilt look well over the world, thou wilt find -that the fairest coun- tenances are oftenest masks to the blackest hearts! Why wouldst thou fear me? 'How knowest thou that I am not worthy of thy love and esteem, and that the worstof me is my seem- ing?'  This was spoken with touching reproof, and in tones that went to the very heart of the young Spanish sailor. He felt as if he had in- flicted a great wrong upon the monster, and he was moved with pity. ^ Ave Maria! but I meant not to hurt thy feelings, senor; for I see now thou hast Chris- tian feelings, though thy visage lieth something ill against thee. Now, as I would fain show thee that I am willing to give the devil his idue, ask me what thy business is here; and, by the toe of saint Peter at Rome! I'll further thy wishes, if I have it in my power.' ' Then tell me, who are these people to whom thou belongest who have landed here, to-nightf?'   ' We are Spaniards all, amigo, save some of us who are Neapolitans, one or two who are French, half a score who have no particular country, and myself, who am by the mother's side Sicilian, and-by the father's an Andaluz 1' ' Well defined; and who is the chief of thy party?' 'The man with the beard? 9 He is old cap- tain Balco-a terrible killer of Spaniards in the Carlist wars; a man, senor, who cuts off more heads than there are beads on the blessed virgin's rosary, and--' ' Not he-but the other, who lately left thee, a man of noble presence, haughty and command- ing, yet youthful. I would know who he is?' 'Bv the girdle of our lady, so would I, senor hunchback! He keeps his own secrets.' ' But he is thy captain?' 'He is the superior man among us; but Lieutenant Balco is our true captain and sailor of our schooner; Don Enrique is a sort of own- er -and gentleman-passenger; nevertheless, he knows how to take command when he will.' 'Thou callest him Don Enrique, am I right?' 'As if thou hadst seen it writ on holy parch- ment.' ' He owns the vessel-I suppose you mean the schooner, I saw you quitting?' ' Si, senor. Then you saw us, did you?' ' Yes. You seemed to Be pursued?' ' No question of it, senor; it was a sleuth hound's chase, strait ahead.' ' Your foe was a frigate?' 'True again. If thou knowest so much, I need not tell thee more.' ' Nay, I. did but use my eyes from the old fort on the cape.' 'Buzeno, then, now use thine ears, for they are full large,. and I will tell thee all I know, which is not knowledge enough, I'll swear to thee, sir dwarf, to give thee a diploma, when thou knowest it, in the college of Salamanca. Know, then, gossip, that we are thirty souls, to say nothing'of our thirty-eight bodies, who sailed some three and a half weeks ago, in something of a hurry, from a small port in the south of Spain, called Capo de Silla. Our mef was a 3   fst schooner of one hundred and seventy tons, and seven guns. She was owned by Don En- rique, who hired our captain to take charge of her; not that he was not a good sailor, never better, but he chose to act the gentleman; for he intended to leave the schooner as soon as he got here. We had no sooner got beyond the capes of the port, than a frigate gave us chase, and kept it up as you have seen; till at last she compelled us to abandon the schooner off this place.' ' And what did the frigate chase for?' ' Ask Don Enrique, Senor FIun'chback.' 'And why did he leave Spain in such haste?' ' Thou must ask Don Enrique, or his neph- ew.' ' Has he a nephew, then?' ' A rare youth, gentle as a woman, but brave as a lion. He is a boy of sixteen, yet stands fire like a veteran.' ' And where 'is he?' 'Dost thou  see?' said the sentry, pointing to her cabin door. 'There he sleeps, to keep watch over the valuables within, while I keep watch without.' ' And who was this Don Enrique, in Spain?' ' By the mass, thou must have been a clerk to the grand Inquisition, the way thou puttest- questions, sir dwarf. I can tell thee no more. ^ I am as dry of further news, as a traveller's purse of maravedis, after passing a night in a gipsey's camp.  But I will ask thee one ques- tion?' 'Two, and it please thee.' 'Tell me, what: wine thou drinkest most that maketh thy voice so mellow. By the seven bells of Toledo I thy voice is like a singing wo- man's.   I would drink thy wine; for if I could talk like thee, with my good figure and hand- some visage, I would make my fortune making love to the ladies-nay, I would look at none less than a princess.' 'If my   voice hath modulation, it, cometh rather of temperance than the wine-cup.' l 'Then temperance hath got to, be a vittue, F aid henceforth I'll forswear wine, and let noth- ing but water pass my lips. But, now I think  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7455-00000018"/> of it, was it not thou whom we saw in a piroque, stealing along the shores of the inlet when we came up to it, and who shot out of sightas soon as discovered. I thought then it-was'a strange, mnannish-boyish, odd shaped creature, and was asking myself if ourang outangs lived in these islands.' 'Man, beware that thou carry not thy jest so far that it outstep playfulness and graze ridicule. Thou mayest wonder at my ugliness, but I nev- er forgive the tongue that moeks!' 'But I did not mock. I but asked thee a civil question, Sir Inquisitor's. secretary, in re- turn for thine.' ' It was I. Good night.' The next instant this singular being disappeared in the tangled thicket, out of which he had emerged. The ] sentry stood a few seconds looking after him, and then shaking his head slowly two or three , times, muttered, as he crossed himself on his 5 forehead and then on his breast: 'Ave Maria sanctissima!

The maiden sapn I reached the summit, which was a green level, , with here and there a tall cocoa tree shooting if into the sky. The fortress with its jagged out- line was directly before-her, and she could dis- tinguish the dark outlines-of cannon that lay L dismantled upon the sides of the embrasures. t  A few paces placed her upon the very top of I the parapet. HTere she stood, took off her cap,  threw back her dark hair, which she untied, and opening the close jacket, bared her neck to the cool sea-breeze. [SEE ENGRAVING.] She seemed to be glad to be alone, and to be able for a few moments to break through the restraints which, before, the eyes of others, her disguise imposed upon her. ' Here, at least, I can feel that I am a, woman again.  How happyi' she added, 'shall I be when I can wear the costume- of one. But this disguise has been my safety, and I ought not to complain of; it, irksome as it has been to me. How glorious the night is I How the wide areh. ing blue, with its host of stars, bends to the far horizon.  How magnificently the ocean plane outspreads to meet the arching vault of heaven !   and what silence and beauty over all! I will stay here and commune with nature, and gather from her fresh strength for life; for I need all that Heaven will give me, the future is al so dark-so uncertain! This conspiracy, so vast and dangerous, which must involve the lives, or elevate 'to the highest fame, those who engage in it, it makes me tremble when I contemplate it! Noble Enrique! If aught should happen to him-but I will not let my love make a cow- ard of me! I will gaze on this scene of beauty, and let its sweet influences calm my soul. God has given us a view of the quiet stars in the far heaven, that in our earthly troubles, tossed and harassed, we may look up to them, drink in the spirit of their serene loveliness, and let the soul grow calm and unmoved like them.' Having remained a few minutes, gazing now upon the ocean, which ceaselessly undulated like a mighty living heart, on which a single sail standing towards the island was visible, and upon the still, quiet skies, and refreshed her heated brow with the cool breeze, she turned away to retrace her steps to the hut, strong, peaceful, and full of hope, as all must be who commune with nature. The place in whioe she was, was the court of a ruined fortress. One half of it lay in the deep darkness caused by the shadow of its parapet. She was crossing this area, when she saw a shadow moving along the ground, on the edge of the parapet. It was a man's head. She stopped, and her heart throbbed with expecta- tion rather than fear. She could see no person, but slowly the shadow of the head and shoul- ders stole along, the' darkness concealing the body which cast it. Her first impulse was to fly, for she at once realized the peril she had placed herself in, by coming abroad unprotected at such an hour, and stooping, she glided swift- ly along the walls of the fort, hoping to reach the rear opening by which she had entered; and trusting to do so without, having been discover- ed. She gained the outside of the ruin, and looking back to see if she were pursued, she saw a dark figure, low and misshapen, bounding after her. Fear now gave her wings. There   was a ditch to cross, and in her anxiety to place it between herself and the man or animal in pursuit, she attempted to spring over it, instead of turning aside a few steps to cross a bridge of plank that spanned it. In doing so, she slip- ped and fell into the moat, but striking the bot- tom unhurt, she darted along the excavation with the fleetness of an antelope, in hopes to find some outlet. It led her around the ruin and towards the sea, and when she expected to come to its extremity, she found herself in front of an arched gate, that appeared to lead into the sub- terranean vaults of the fortification.  The gate was ajar, and having no other alternative, she passed through it, and instinctively closed it against her pursuer, whose steps she heard fol-. lowing her through the moat. The gate went to with a heavy sound,. that echoed with start- ling hollowness through the chambers beneath the walls. She now found herself in total darkness, and believing herself secure from pursuit, she stop. ped, like a chased gazelle, to breathe, and cal- culate upon her danger and hode of ultimate escape. Who or what had pursued her she had no certain perception, for the only glimpse -she had of it, it seemed to her to be either a beast with a human head, or a man renping on all' fours like a beast. ' Sancta Maia 1' she whispered, kissing a crucifix which hung from. her neck, 'protect me, I implore thee, in this hour of peril 1' She  listened, expecting each instant to hear her pursuer at the gate, but all was silent; and she began to cherish the hope that he had pass- ed on, without having seen her enter. This idea gave her hopes of a speedy release. As she-got a little accustomed to the darkness, she discovered that the place where she was wa  an arched subterranean room, and at the extremity was a faint light. Towards this she made her way, cautiously and slowly, aided by the sword she wore as a part of her male costumes feeling her pathwith  it over the damp ground. As she drew near the light, she discovered to her alarm, that instead of being moonlight admitted from some opening, it was the light of a lamp,  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7455-00000019"/> I, and that it came from an apartment within the chamber she was in. Voices from this place, i low and murmuring voices, reached her ears; ! and feeling that what was said might, in, some way, relate to her safety, she advanced with a velvet step to see and listen. Whom the, apartment contained, and what was said in her overhearing, we shall relate by- and-by; in the meanwhile we return to Don Pelayo. When this ancient buccaneer chief learned from the sentry the departure of Garcilaso, he resolved at once, knowing the insecurity of the vicinage, to follow her steps; and directed by Turilo, he took the direction of the fort. When he reached it and gained the parapet, he- could neither see nor hear any signs of her. All ,was silent.  Nothing moved on land; and on the sea he saw only a small sloop gently moving i along about a mile off, with her bows pointed i towards the east., At first he thought she was h standing seaward, but as he more particularly t noticed her course, he perceived that she was I edging in towards the fort. While he was look- t ing he was not a little surprised to see a light r rne up her mastshead, which after a few mo- . ments was replied to, by a suddenly kindled a blab at his very feet. He bent over and gazed ii down the wall of the parapet, and saw a dwarf heaping fuel upon a fire he had just kindled on c a ledge that projected beyond the. base of the tl fort, whiih was built upon it. He saw that he tI was not discovered, and carefully drawing back within the shadow of a guava tree that grew on of the wall, he watched the vessel, andc also the yi beacin kindler.  The latter was a dwarf, with w long hair, and an ugly visage, which, when the th red flame glowed upon it,- looked as if it might, ai have belonged to- an inhabitant of the lower T1 world.  Old Baloo gazed on -him with super- ha stitious awe.                be ' By the holy rood!' he. ejaulated, ' the old pa tales I  used to hear about this castle being eli haunted must-be true, for this creature belongs fro not to earth t What is he doing here making ali fires? It iseither a signal to the sloop, or a -th fire - to burn Olitians in I * I must be on my, be   he, guard I' and he placed his hand on the hilt of ae, his cutlass. 'Pray the saints that Don En- s; rique's fair maiden or wife, as the case may ble, ne have not fallen into the hands of any of this a monster's brotherhood. There, they lower the light from the sloop and hoist it again. Three at times, hey! Well, this is regular telegraphing. y- And see I the dwarf three times waves a blazing an brand, and then' smothers out the fire! -This sloop must be one of the ancient craft; but she Id takes odd precautions before coming in! I will ie watch her awhile.  If she touches shore, I shall ie be tempted to go down and ask about the Bel y Isabel; for it comes from the direction in which n they sailed, and  may give me some tidings of d her fate.' ts  The sloop, which was a large craft, of a hun- e dred and seventy ton at the very least, with an g immense mainsail, jib, flying-jib, and flying-top- I sail, having  exchanged her signals with the s shore, put her helm up, and run directly in for y the island. In ten minutes, Don Pelayo saw s her anchor at the foot of the cliff, and so near - that he could have cast a stone upon her deck. t The decks were fully exposed to his gaze. They * were without armament, and did not show half [ a dozen men. All was quiet, not a word reach- 1ing his ear in the process of mooring. f At  any rate, she seems to be a peaceful craft,' said Baleo, after stretching his neck over the parapet. 'But there,-they  are getting their boat alongside. The skipper means to land!' Three persons got into the boat, besides two oarsmen, and pulled to the beach, within fifty yards of-which the sloop rode at anchor.: Balco wa)ched the landing of the three men, 'and saw them converse together, standing on the sand, and pointing to the top of the promontory.-. The dwarf, for it was the same personage who had spoken with Turilo who had kindled the beacon, had no sooner. seen the landing of the party, than he descended from the top of the elif, swinging himself from branch to ledge and from ledge to branch, hand after hand, till he alighted almost in their midst. Baleo noticed the manner of the interview, which was./like that between parties who are strangers to each-other,   yet were to -transact business together. After a few minutes delay, they proceeded to ascend the cliff, by a path pointed out to them by the dwarf. In about five minutes their persons came in sight over the verge, , and they all four stood on the rock by the smouldering beacon- fire, and directly beneath the place where Don Pelayo was observing them. ' A steep height to climnb, Master Silvestre,' said the tallest of the three men, in English, as he turned round and looked off seaward. ' Our sloop looks like a cockle-shell below us.' ' Is all prepared for us?' demanded one of the others, who was shorter, stouter, and some years the senior of the first speaker. Yes, sir,' responded Silvestre, which seem- ed to be the name of the hunchback. ' As soon as I saw the sloop I sent for the chief. He will soon be here; for he has been passing the last ten days at a villa not half a league hence. Come with me, and we will go to the place of rendezvous. ' The three men, the third who had not spoken being a young man, not more than twenty, but of a striking appearance, now followed the dwarf round the wall, and disappeared from the eyes of Balco. ' By the red hood of our lady of Balderio, here is some secret conspiracy going on.  These strangers are not pirates, but Americans, and military men at that. I have it! These whis- pers I have heard of an attempt to revolutionize the island, and of American aid, were not all wind. This secret mission of this party, I'll be swqrn, has something to do with it. They spoke of a leader, too! I wonder if they have gone so far as to choose a chief. ' If there is, in truth, a conspiracy, and work is to be done for an ac- tive partizan, I will not be behind-hand in it. I will try and ascertain what these caballeros are here for, and if it is as I suspect, I will offer my services.  It may lead to fortune. But-I had forgotten Garcilaso I Perhaps by this time she has returned to camp. At any rate, she does not seem to be any where about here. Hark! I hear the galloping of a horse! It is no doubt X the leader coming down to meet these men! I will follow, and try and listen to their interview.' i   r With this intention, he let himself down the outer wall of the fort, and, sword in hand, to , defend himself against surprise, he took the path which had been followed by the party. It con- r ducted him round the base of the fortress, and to an old gateway, above which was built a large square tower, containing a single chamber, with arched windows, looking both oceanward and landward, through which blew the winds and shone the moonbeams unobstructed by panes. r It was half overgrown with running vines, and was a picturesque object. He saw the men reach the gate-way, and at the same moment a horseman ride up at full gallop, leap from the saddle, throw his rein to a slave who followed him, and approach them. He cast a quick, penetrating  glance upon them, and then, as if recognizing the younger of the party, he extended his hand and heartily welcomed him. The latter then presented the others to him, and them to him by names which Balco did not distinctly understand, as they were American, But he heard the name of the new comer. It was Lopez. The dwarf now opened a door leading to stairs up which they ascended, Lopez first, to the square chamber above the gate-way. The dwarf then closed the gate, and the whole party were thus shut up, doubtless, thought Balco, in secret conclave.- EHe resolved to try to penetrate their secret; and aided by some grape vines and the limb of a projecting tree, he ; noiselessly raised himself to a level with one of the windows.  It was trel- lised by nature so thickly with the foliage that' grew across, that he could look into the apart- menat without being seen. It was a room about seventeen feet square, with walls of hewn stone, and containing no other furniture than two benches, and a Shutter which served as a table, raised upon two stones. Two or three other square rocks that had fallen from the wall into the apartment,served as seats. When Balco looked in through the leaves, the  three strangers were seated, two on the bench, and one by the table, at the upper end of which sat Lopez, with a small port-folio in his hands, which he was in the act of unrolling; he was also talking.  &#xD;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7455-00000020"/> 'Your arrival is in good season, my noble friends,' he said, in good English, 'for everp thing seems to be approaching the crisis we have so long expected. I am proud to behold here, ready to draw their gallant swords for-the inde- pendence of Cuba, soldiers whose names have been so distinguished in your late war with Mex- ico. General,' he said, addressing with a cour- teous politeness, and a fine smile on his aristo- cratic Castilian face, 'I have'read of your mil- itary deeds, and wished in my heart to take you by the hand as I have done this hour.  Col- onel,' he continued, addressing the taller of the two, whose countenance was expressive of a high and chivalrous character, 'your gallantry at Monterey, at the 'gates of Mexico, on the heights of Chepultepec, is not unknown to me.  With such men as associate leaders, our success is eertain.' ' Senor General,' said the handsome young man who had been so warmly welcomed by the  chief of  the conspirators, 'the heart of the bravest warriors of the American army is with us.  In obedience to your command, and with a the letters which you furnished me to be the i bearer of to the States of the Union, I visited 1 New Orleans, Nashville, St. Louis, Louisville, t Baltimore, New York, and other cities, and in I each of these your letters were no sooner read, 3 than brave hearts responded  to the call. As o an evidence of my success, these two eminent ir American officers have accompanied me  back, e to have an interview with you.'      tl ' My brave aid, you have well executed your mission,' said General Lopez, with a  look of r admiration; ' and I  am not surprised at the e result, knowing so well as I do the chivalry of the American character, its contempt of kings, a its sympathy with every people who aspire to w political freedom. They are the bravest soldiers w as well as sincerest patriots. Gentlemen, I am se grateful for, I am proud of, your presence here. fo Let us now to business. What have you to of- fer from your countrymen towards our enter- de prse?  ' We   come authorized, noble Senor Lopez, to st, offer you from New Orleans two thousand men, th   le commanded by the bravest officers,' said the y colonel. ' Here are letters to you, which you re will read at your leisure, confirming the offer, e, with the names of the gentlemen who will lead e- the expedition.' re  'I see your name is at the head, sir,' an- K- swered Lopez, casting his rapid eagle glance r- over the papers. D -. 'From New Ydrk, Senor Lopez,' said the I- General officer, I also come with offers of mili- a tary aid. We can bring to Cuba three thou- [- sand men, so soon as we obtain transports.' B 'Excellente, Senores! This is more than I i dared hope for,' cried Lopez, his fine dark face t lighting up with pleasure. ' With five thousand s men   we can revolutionize the island. The i Spanish regular force does not amount to more 3 than eleven thousand, that can be brought into the field to oppose us.' ' With five thousand we can whip four times 3 our number,' answered the colonel, as quietly as if it was a matter of course. I The Mexican war proves, this, gentlemen,' l answered Lopez, smiling. 'But we hope for aid from Spain. There are many cavaliers who live in Spain who hold estates here, which, from the heavy taxes government levies upon them, bring them no returns.  I have been for two years in correspondence with the most influential of these. Two of them have so far used their influence as to be appointed colonels in the gov- ernor's brigades, which lately came over; so that we have friends even among our foes.' '  And they will likely be able to bring their regiments ,over to our side,' remarked the Unit. ed States general, ' That will be their aim, and for this end they accepted the commands they hold. Moreover, we are daily looking for a messenger from Spain, who will be the bearer of what -news our friends send, and let us know what funds we may look for from that quarter.' 'The conspiracy, senor general, seems to be deeply laid,' said the United States general.- ' It seems that so far as men are concerned, we shall not need this branch of assistance. Ten thousand patriotic hearts beat in the United   States in sympathy with Cuba. But we need money. These are the sinews of war, you know, general.' ' And money you shall have. The influen- tial planters of Cuba, and many of my friends in Spain, have sent me gold. I have now one million and a half of dollars in my hands. Of this you shall have one third to purchase trans- ports at New York and New Orleans, and to pay troops.' 'Then the revolution is achieved, senor,' answered the Louisianian colonel, with em- phasis.  ' Yes.  There is no dpubt of its successful issue, with the five thousand men you propose to furnish. With a less number I would not care to raise the flag of independence. We must make a show of strength in order to inspire the wavering with confidence in us, as well as to alarm our enemies. Is there any probability that the President of the Union will oppose the departure of the troops ' - ' It has already- come to the ears of govern- ment, and here is General Taylor's proclama- tion,' answered the New York general. Lopez read it, and a cloud passed across his usually placid brow. ' This is a serious affair. I fear that the de- cision of character of this war-worn president of your republic will oppose obstacles to the ex- pedition. This I did not look for!' and the Cuban leader rose and walked up and down the room half a dozen turns, while the rest of the conspirators watched his emotions with some anxiety. 'But, senor,' said the American colonel, 'we can defeat the efforts made by our president.- We can make our preparations so secret as .to mislead him; and we can be so cautious as to defy the law.' 'I wish so. I hope so! Everything depends on you Americans! It is true that the more intelligent Cubans are impatient of the yoke of Spain. But we are not a. warlike people, we islanders.  We have never borne arms to con- quest or for defence. We must lean upon tried soldiers. If the Cubans see an army of your   warlike Saxons land boldly on their shores to overthrow the royal power of Spain, and make them free, they will flock to your standard in thousands after they have seen you victorious in your first onset. But I confess that without such encouragement from you, they would fear to move.   They ae accustomed to fear the power of Spain. They have bowed in subi ' r sion for centuries to the tyranny of a captain- general, and submitted to the insolence of a standing army, till these evils are as much a part of their existence as the storms and pesti- lences that belong to their climate. The stan- dard must be reared by Anglo-Saxon hands!' 'Where should the landing take place, se- nor?' asked the Louisianian. ' South of the island, if possible, for the main body. The Isle of Pines would make a good rendezvous. Here is my plan. Follow, if you please, gentlemen, my compasses with your eyes as I trace this map. You say you will embark from the shores of Louisiana, colonel?' 'Yes; all you have to do, is to name the day when you will be ready to receive us.' ' And you, general, can embark from New York?' ' Si, senor.' ' Then listen to my plan. You see here the Islos de Pinos. It is a' place visited only by fishermen. Here I wish the Louisiana division of the army of liberation to land, and wait until they receive orders from,me to land on the south shore of the island, whence a march of two days will bring them under the walls of Havana, in the rear of the city. Half of your division, general, I wish to land at Cardenas, which you see here on the north side of the island, and a few leagues from Matanzas. The third division of two thousand men I mean shall be a feint, and is intended to draw the attention of the troops at Havana and Matanzas, inducing the captainsgeneral to send his whole force to this point. The attack at Cardenas must, if poWi- ble, be made on the twentieth of May.  On the same day the division at the Isle of Pines will be landed, and make a forced marph across the island, and will surprise Havana while. its troops  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7455-00000021"/> are absent to oppose the invasion borderers. Matanzas will also bestripped of her troops, to concentrate them at Cardenas, and the reserve can easily capture that important point. The fiercest contest must be at Cardenas, which must be taken and held at all risks, till Havana and Matanzas fall into the hands of: the other divi- Isions. Such, senors, is my plan of invasion.- It will be impossible to succeed with less than the forces named, and with less than this num- ber of divisions.' ' Your plan is admirable, General Lopez,' ex- claimed both officers at once. 'It is worthy of your high -military genius. But there will be somie difficulty in bringing all the divisions to their rendezvous in equal time,' added the Am- erican general, after looking carefully over the map. ' The division from New York must sail two weeks in advance of that from New Orleans. The rendezvous of the two divisions for the des- cent on Cardenas and Matanzas must be the Tortoise-Key, which is but a day's run from here. I shall have couriers mounted on fleet horses, to traverse the island to inform me when the southern  division lands on the island of pines, and a signal fire built on Mount Chris-  tophe, near the centre of the island, will be the signal for them that you have landed at Carde- nas-that they must advance northward on Ha- 4 Vana; and a large signal fire from   this cape, r which  you can see from the Key, w9ill be the 1 signal for you to weigh anchor in two divisions, a one to land at Cardenas, the other to advance 1 on to Matanzas, but too far from  this shore to t be discovered; and  a cannonading heard from t Cardenas will be a  signal to you? that the des- 1 cent is effected, and that the troops will be On the move from Matanzas to meet it.  Then you ' will stand  with your fleet directly into that port. ':  These arrangements for the invasion, afer b some farther explanations of detail, being ap- n proved'by the American chiefs, General Lopez h accompanied them  outside of the fort, apologia t ingfor his Want of hospitality in not inviting  them to the villa:, where he had been for a few u   s. days sojourning, saying, 'we must be extreme- to lr cautious. The governor-general has his spies re *upon all my movements. He has heard of my ie aid, Don Rinaldo's departure for the -States, st and the waters have for three weeks bedn filled d with cruisers to intercept his return. We must v i- be on the watch for them.' " -' We? are you going to embark with us an enor?'             - l-  ' Yes. I have made -up my mind that my presence in New Orleans will do more for the :- cause just now than by remaining on the island. ,f I can return before the expedition, after having e arranged all the movements of the divisions.' o  'Or with it, general,' said both ofcers. 'If - you go you must lead it.' e  ' We will settle that in your southern capital,' answered Lopez, with a smile. ' You see, here a is my portmanteau already for my departure,' he added, taking it from the slave, who unlash- - ed it from his horse. s  The party now   descended the cliff by the X path which they had taken in climbing up, and ; Balco lost further hearing of their conversation, although he descended from the window and drew as near to them as he could. But he was able to follow them with his eyes, and he saw them reach the beach; but the dwarf was not with them. He saw   at the same time a train of five mules wind round  another and broader road that led  to the shore, each of which was heavily laden. The officers gathered round the animals and proceeded to unladen them, aided by the two sailors who had rowed their boat, and the two slaves who  had conducted them. As the sacks were thrown upon the beach, Balco heard the sound of silver. ' The  bags contain money!b he exclaimed. ' This Cuban leader is as good as his word.' Balco was right. The mules were laden with dollars, which General Lopez had ordered to be broiight to the beach from the villa, when he mounted his horse to obey the signal which told him: that the messenger, Don Rinaldo, had re- turned from his important expedition to the United States. Balco watched  the process of unloading the mules, and placing the silver in   the boat, which had to make a second trip to the sloop, saw the officers get'on board, heard the command to weigh anchor and to make sail, and beheld the little vessel, freighted with such im- portant interests to Cuba, if not to the world, shape her course out of the harbor, and stretch away under a steady breeze for the entranee to the Gulf of Mexico. ' By the rood!' he ejaculated, ' this conspi- racy hath bottom to it. It will turn out no child's play. Now, good Sir Balco, what part wilt thou play in this coming matter? There- returns the young man who went as messenger! His head would have but slender fastenings on his shoulders did the captain-general but know what I know! Doubtless, if I made known what I -have heard to-night, I should be well rewarded, and taken into high power. By the mass! I'll think of it!' 'Thou  hadst best keep  thy tongue and thoughts to thyself, if thou hast discovered aught not intended for thy ears,' said a voice behind his back. CHAPTER VI. 'What hand hath done this murderous deed, Spoletto?' ON    PELAYO   turned short upon- the speaker, and recognized the dwarf. ' Thou imp of infernos-scum of hell! what dost thou here above the earth?' he demanded, as he saw the face of the hunchback blazing with : fierce wrath, and a dagger in, his hand. ' Avaunt, I will nob speak to thee!' and BalIo crossed himself with one hand while he placed himself f on guard, with his cutlass in the other. I  am here to slay thee! Thou art a spy, and hast heard and seen what thou must pay I for with thy life,' answered the dwarf, and as he spoke he sprung upon him, got within his guard 1 and aimed a   deadly blow at his heart. Stout C and skillful as the old buccaneer chief was, he : was so taken by surprise, that he could not par-. ry the,blow, and received the dagger between c his ribs beneath the heart up to its hilt. With ( a  deep oath which terminated in a groan of pain, l   'he fell backward heavily upon the ground, and lay insensible. ' Thou wilt no more doubt which side thou wilt take in this contest,' murmured the dwarf, as he replaced the dagger which had done this deed, in his girdle. So perish all the enemies of liberty!' At this moment the young Spaniard, Don Rinaldo, came up. On seeing the fallen man, he stopped and demanded of the hunchback the meaning of the spectacle. 'He is a spy, and is justly punished, senor;' answered the dwarf, in the quiet silvery tones which characterized him, and with which he spoke even when he had addressed Balco. 'Thou hast done well,' answered Don Rinal- do. ' Where is the horse General Lopez rode hither upon?  I return upon it.' 'There, held by his slave,' answered the dwarf. ' But 'first come into my mother's dwell- ing and get refreshment; and letters I have there from thy mother, entrusted to me for thee!' ' They will be welcome.' ' And all has turned out as thou wouldst have it, senor?' interrogated the dwarf, as he con- ducted him around the foot of the parapet, 'All, Silvestre. Within three months, Cuba will be free-' ' And I avenged?' 'Thy patriotism is vengeance against foes, I fear me,' Silvestre,' said the young cavalier, smiling. ' Revenge is sweet, senor.' 'So it is; and if thou canst unite it with freeing thy native island, thou hast so many the more ends achieved. But what news, since I left? Is the captain general making prepara- tions of defence?' ' He has issued orders for the militia to arm; has repaired old defences, and is turning mer.- chantmen into war-ships. Here are the steps. Be careful, senor!' They now descended a few stone steps that conducted into the moat, and after walking a dozen paces, they came to .the gate vaioh- an lour or two before Garcilaso, or rather Dona  &#xD;<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7455-00000022"/> Mariana had entered, and closed after her in her flight. ' There have been other spies here, to-night, senor, besides the gray-bearded man I have just slain,' said Silvestre, as he pushed at the door. ' As your vessel hove in sight, I saw some person looking about here, who no sooner saw me, than he fled. I pursued him along this moat some distance and he finally escaped, and well for him that he did not meet me.' , The door seems fast, Silvestre,' said the cav- alier, after the dwarf had made several efforts to npen it. ' Ho, mother! Open there within. It is I?' called the dwarf. There was no reply. The two then united their strength and forced it. They- entered a dark, vaulted passage, which seemed to be a continuation of the moat arched over. Groping his way along after the hunchback, who moved with a familiar step through the gloom, they came to a second door which was ajar, and from which came the rays of a light. Entering, the first object that struck their sight, was the body of a woman lying upon the ground, her gray hair dishevelled and spread over her-face and shoulders. Silvestre uttered a cry, and sprang forward to raise her up.' 'My mother! Some fiend hath slain her! Aid me, senor.' The young cavalier who had been struck with amazement at the sight, advanced to his assis- tance. Upon lifting the head and looking into the face, it was plainly seen that death had there placed his seal! The dwarf -gave utter. ance to a wild cry, a sound something between a shriek and a curse, and sought for the wound. 'It is here-beneath the heart,' said the cavalier, lifting up one arm. ' It is the'wound of a dagger. ' She is dead! There is no restoring her,' he said, bitterly. ' But how came .this deed? Who has been here?  Is it. the act of him who  has already wronged and dishonored me? I will find the author of this, though I go over the whole tarth, and down to hell-for there would be more likely to be found the man who would   do a deed like this. Look round, senor. See what is here. My eyes almost fail me with my tears. She was a kind, noble, true-hearted mother to me! When all the world looked upon her deformed child as a monster, she loved me the more, and sought with the most tender and delicate affection to make me forget the curse- under which I was born. When I have felt that all mankind looked upon me with pity, she would console my pride-she and my sister-my beautiful and noble Beatrice--as beautiful as I am hideous-they were my only friends. One of them is-but I can't dwell upon her fate now! I The hour of vengeance is at hand i! The other is here, dead!' Don Rinaldo regarded the deep sorrow of the hunchback with   sincere sympathy. By the light of a single lamp that burned in the apart. ment, he looked round for the murderer, as the dwarf insisted that, as the outer door was fast, he could not have escaped. The room was a large arched chamber, which had once been used for the stores and as an armory, when the fortress was occupied. It retained still the oak- en benches on the sides against the wall, where, ,the soldiers sat in winter when it was used as a guard-house. Rocks for muskets were still re- maining; and   shelves for storing packages. There were a few articles of furniture in it, and arush matting upon the floor. Among-the ar- ticles, was a marble pier-table, gilt and carved, and a candelabra of massive silver, and very ancient pattern, and a roll of rich rugs, all three from their elegance, presenting a striking con- trast with the gloomy character of the place. There was only one window to the place, which was a grated half-moon at the top, near the arch of the'extremity, and which, when one climbed up to it, commanded a prospect of the, sea. Through it the moonbeams now strearmed with full radiance. . ' Seest thou any  one?' hoarsely asked the dwarf, who still held the head of his mother upon his knee, and was gazing with tears drop. ping from his'eyes upon her marble face-a face of singular dignity and calmness in death, and which in life, at an earlier day, must have been   singularly handsome, for there was not a feature that was not faultless. 'I see no one! Whoever has done the deed, has escaped.' ' They could not go'out save by the window, and that is grated-' ' No-one of the bars is removed and swing- ing,' answered-the young Cuban. ' Seest thou where they have escaped!' and he pointed to the visible opening. ' Yes-they have escaped. But such a deed as this, heaven will not let go unpunished. And -here! in the presence of the Great Being who made me, and with my murdered mother clasp- ed to my heart, I swear that I will not rest, till I have avenged this leed by the blood of the heart of her assassin i' The young Cuban gazed in amazement and almost terror upon the dwarf, as he gave utter- ance to this vow, with his eyes elevated, and his right arm raised to heaven. 'Mother!  Lay there! Gently and with honor I will put thy head upon this cold stone! Thou hast heard my vow, for thy spirit is near me! A good and kind mother ever hast thou been to me! Thou hast tried to make me hap- py, and to teach me that though the body be mis-formed, the soul partakes not, of necessity, of its deformity. Thou hast stilled the fierce tumult of my bosom, by pointing me to a world beyond the stars, where all souls shall stand be- fore God in his confessed image, glorious as angels. Thou hast made me patient with my monstrous body. Thou hast taught me to sub- mit to Heaven's ordinations. Thou hast, by respecting me, taught me to respect myself. Thou hast made life endurable to me! Blessing and honor be upon thee, my mother, thus strick- en down in thy gray hairs! Now, none stand between me and God I none stand between me and man! I am alone, and alone must I bear the burden of existence!' 'Silvestre, I swear to thee, I will be thy friend!' said the young Cuban, with emotion. 'Yes, but how? Not from love, but from pity! I ask no man's pity! I hate -all men that stand erect, created upright in God's image I   3 When I look upon thy noble stature, with thy countenance to the stars, and then reflect upon , myself, that have more of the form of a brute, with its face prone to the earth, I hate thee for , the glory of thy divine beauty of form; but I hate thee not so profoundly as I hate myself!' ' Nay, but my noble friend-' 'Away! I will none of thy lordly pity. Leave me to my grief and my contempt. Leave me, I say! I have told thee, I hate thee I And next to an upright man in form, show me a mon- strous dwarf, like myself, and I will only hate him worse than I hate thee! Wilt thou shut in thy words, and leave me to howl like the beast I -am, over my murdered dam?' The young Cuban, whose manly beauty sin- gularly contrasted with the hideous exterior of Silvestre, gazed upon him a moment in silence, and with emotions of deep sympathy. He be- trayed in his fine face the generous pity that moved his soul to befriend the miserable hunch- back. He advanced a step, as if he would strive further to win his confidence. ' Silvestre, thou shouldst not thus treat thy friends!  But, if thou wilt not have my friend- ship, let me remind thee of the lovely Beatrice, thy sister, who-' ' Darest thou mock me by naming her, the lost and beautiful, ft such an hour, man!' cried the dwarf, starting to his feet. Leave me I I would be alone I Thy horse neighs for thy coming. Away!' The young Cuban was crossing the chamber to obey, more in sorrow than in anger, when his foot struck something, which as it rolled over the floor, sparkled like a jewel. He raised it, and saw that it was a crucifix of gold, with diamond-headed nails in the hands and feet of the figure. The singular beautyland novelty of the jewel, struck him, and turning to the dwarf, he said: Is this thine? If so, I would give thee thy price for it.' , Mine?  Would I deck m massof flesh wih adornments like afair woman? But hold I Let me see it! Didst thou find it here?' ' Yes, on the floor.'  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7455-00000023"/> 'Then give it me I Let me look at it. It must have been dropped by the assassin!' *Without doubt,' answered the Cuban, with interest. The dwarf took the crucifix, and closely re- garded it. He at length shook his head.' ' Do you not recognize it?' ' No. But I will know its owner! I swear to know who let it fall; for it was dropped by the murderer of my mother.' 'I will aid thee!' 'Revenge is sweeter when it is obtained alone.' ' Does it bear any graving?' ' I see nothing. Look, for my eyes are blind- ed!' ' Here is-one letter-nay two, upon the foot of the cross at the end.' ' Quickly-what are they?' 'I. A.' 'I and A.   I will grave them also in my heart.  Give me the jewel. Now, once more, leave me alone, senor!' ' When I return from Havana, I hope I shall find thee more composed, my worthy Silvestre ;' and with these words, the young Cuban turned and left the subterranean apartment. He found the door or outer gate ajar, as he c had left it, and making his way to the esplanade into the full moonlight, he crossed to a clump t of low trees where he saw a horse and servant in waiting. The slave at once 'recognized the cavalier, 1 and expressing his delight at seeing him once 1 more returned, held the stirrup for him to mount. t The Cuban then after lingering a moment, to see if the sloop containing Lopez and the Amer- n ican chiefs was still in view, and finding he r could no longer discern its outline, he put spurs o to his horse crying, ' en avant ' The two horse- . men rode rapidly into the interior, and after coming into the high road which traversed the p island about a mile from the shore, struck to the e right, and galloped on until they came to the b gate of a  villa, which was situated in the heart 1l of a  coffee estate. The slave dismounted to w open the gate andelose it after the ardent horse. n   It man, and in a few minutes both were lost in the dark windings of the shaded avenue that led to h the villa.        ' ' Ah, general! What news? You have been !- absent so long, I feared that some- But no! it is not Don Narciso, but Rinaldo! Welcome back- again, my noble youth!' r  These words were uttered by a tall, military y looking man, with gray hair and a fine face, who stood on the portico of the villa, drawn out of the house by the sound of their galloping. , I  ' Thanks, my good uncle!  I am quite as happy to return, as you are to see me! AHow are all my dear friends?' ' Well--all well, my  boy,' answered the Spanish gentleman, embracing him after he had t alighted from his horse; ' and anxious for your return. Your voyage has been successful?' 'As I could wish, or any of the friends of the cause, uncle.' 'The blessed saints be praised.  Where is the general V' * Embarked for Louisiana, in the same ves- sel which brought me hither. The news I gave him prompted him to throw himself at once among his American friends,. Two offieers of rank, and great courage and high influence came over with me.' 'And you have not extended my hospitality to them?' 'They have gone back with General Lopez. The Americans are ready   to aid us. They, however, need money--they want to see and know our chief, General Lopez; and he has taken himself and the gold to show to them.1 ' He has done well, perhaps. But you must not stand here talking. Come in, and you shall relate to me, ovei refreshments, the particulars of your dangerous mission. I was fearful you would be captured.' 'Not dangerous, uncle, unless it were the peril I was certainly placed in of being captur- ed by the beauties of the Union.' Never did I behold so much and? such varieties of female loveliness; such enchanting manners, united with such intelligence and grace. I nearly lost my heart, I willeonfess.?   ' Nay-by the emotion, boy, I would vouch for it, thou didst altogether lose it to some one of these damsels, who are, I know as beautiful as the men are, brave.. But I will not draw thy secret from thee. When we are free-when Cuba, casting off her allegiance to Spain, be- comes independent, and unites herself as the thirty-second State, to this magnificent Union, I have no question that there will be numerous minor unions with benefit of clergy-ha, boy?' The young and handsome Cuban made no, reply, but blushed deeply; and together they entered the hall of the villa. ' What is the news from Havana?' asked the young man. ' There is considerable excitement. The cap. tain general seems to be awake and alarmed. He has issued a military order -to fill all vacan- cies in the regiments, and to enlist new ones. I am told that powder and ball in large quanta I ties have been sent from the city to different ( fortified points. -All this is done as secretly as  possible. How the intelligence reached the ears of the government no one knows.   There is I evidently a spy among us.  You had not de- d parted ten hours, before it reached the ears of the captain general, and he despatched an armed s vessel after you. But I knew it returned some c 9 days ago unsuccessful.' 'We were chased for thirty hours, but sue. V ceeded in escaping  by using our sweeps. I h supposed that it was a pirate; but I have now tl no doubt that it was the  government vessel. f Can I have a fresh horse early?' 'You are not going to leave us so soon?' el ' With as little delay as possible. I must of see our friends in the city. General Lopez has I entrusted a message with me for them I'  al 'Do you know   a Spanish frigate passed the G Cape this afternoon? She was in ehase of a schooner till after dark.' ' What could it have .been?' 'I feared it might be you.'       th( ' No. We  saw a large ship about two hours ch before midnight, to the eastward of us,' which was no doubt the frigate. It is from the navy ho the American invading force will have most to wit   Ah fear. If it could be managed to draw them off ne from this part of the coast, when the landing is 1, to be made, success is certain; but it would be qy fatal to our cause, if any of thb vessels which in bring over the American soldiers- should fall e- into the hands of the squadron.' ie  ' Yes, and every one of the American friends I would   be shot. The wisdom, however, of is Lopez, and the council whom he advises with, V' will prevent such an unhappy catastrophe. o, Well, if you are to ride so early, you had best y have rest.' 'I forgot to say that Dona Leonora has been e murdered in her dwelling-place, in the ruins of the fort.' ' Murdere?'   ' Silvestre and I found her dead on the floor, - yet warm as if the deed had been recently done.' '. This is sad, very sad!  Poor dwarf! How he loved her; and she thought more of him than t even of her daughter, beautiful as she was. s Who could have done this?' ' It is a  mystery. A cross set with diamonds i I  picked up near her, which had evidently been dropped by the assassin!' F We  must have spies about us. , This deed l smacks of the power that robbed her of her child!' ' So I have thought, and so Silvestre believes.. When I   am gone, see him and try and comfort him. He is too sensitive and noble to be left thus alone. He is human with all his de. formity.' ' No man in Cuba has a nobler mind, or great- er soul than Silvestre. His head is a fountain of wisdom, as his heart is of generous feelings. I will seek him, and I will use efforts too, to try and find out the  perpetrator of this deed. Good night I' 'Good night, sir, and adieu, as I shall be in saddle by the dawn, and will not disturb you.' With these words the two gentlemen parted, though not without kissing one another on the cheek after the Spanish custom. Early, at break of day, the clatter of horses' hoofs on the gravel of the avenue under his windo, half-aroused to consciousness the owner  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7455-00000024"/> of the villa, Don Pedro Guzman, and he recol- lected that it was the hour of his nephew's de- parture, and uttering a half-sleepy prayer for his safety, he once more sunk to repose. Though deeply interested in the success of the contem- plated revolution, Don Pedro was too wary to take an active part as a leader. So far as he could aid and abet by permitting his house to be an occasional rendezvous or shelter for the conspirators, he did so; but he was too rich to wish to run the risk of forfeiting his estates, and perhaps losing his head, in case of a failure of the daring enterprise. His position was similar to that of hundreds of the opulent coffee planters, who, at heart desiring a dissolution of the politi- cal connection with Spain, nevertheless were too cautious to commit themselves-by any overt act, until they- were sure that the conspiracy was in the full tide of success. It was thus, there- fore, that the initiatory steps, the first active measures must be taken, the opening blow must be struck by foreigners. Lopez looked to the Americans to raise the standard, and only then expected his countrymen of Cuba to rally around it. Indolent, unused to war, most of the native Cubans, desirous of liberty as they no doubt were, were quite willing that it should be secur- ed to them without their own co-operation. With exalted ideas of the prowess and warlike skill of the American soldiers, they believed that the conquerors of Mexico had only to land with a handful of warriors, to fill the government with terror, and bring every Spanish ensign down to their feet. We now return to Don Enrique. We left him, it will be remembered, asleep in one of the berths in the hut of the pirate chief, Don Alva- dos. The latter having gone forth with Balco, leaving him there, went down to his lugger to prepare for the morning's departure; while Balco, as we have seen, proceeded to the cape in search of Garcilaso, where we left him lying upon the ground, struck down by the dagger of the dwarf. After Don Enrique had slept about four hours, he awoke; for no seaman can sleep more than that at once, without waking; his four hour   watch at sea forming in him this habit of period- ical sleep, of which he can never afterwards break himself. He at once rose to his feet and walked out to the door. ; He looked at the moon, which was riding high in the heavens, as if try. ing to divine the hour from her place. ' I have slept well. It must be on the turn of the morning. I The dawn cannot be far down the east,' he said. ' I wonder how it has fared with Mariana! I trust she has slept and still sleeps!- for she needed rest. I will go and see after her!' He approached the cabin. The sentry, no longer Turilo, but another, was standing against the corner of the hut asleep. ' I will not dis- turb thee, poor fellow. Thou hast need of sleep as well as I,' said the young nobleman. (I will enter and see how fares it with my heart's life!' The door was ajar. A light burned within. He first looked in and then entered. All was quiet, save a short, quick breathing, irregular and uneasy. He took the light and approach- ed the corner where he beheld the maiden sleep- ing, with her head upon the flag of the schooner. She slept heavily as the light did not walke her. But her face was flushed, her bosom heaved tu- multuously, and its beauty half displayed by her restlessness which laid open the front of her jacket. Her hair also escaped from  the fillet which confined it by day under cap, lay in wild confusion over the blue and crimson pillow she had chosen. He gazed upon her with surprise, and won- dered what troublesome dreams could visit so fair a form. But when he saw that the dress she wore was torn as if by briers and sharp rlocks, when he saw the soles of her shoes were soiled, and discovered upon her hand and cuff the stains of fresh blood, a drop of which was also on her cheek, he became alarmed.  He went out and asked the guard if Garcilaso had gone out dur. ing the night. ' Si, senor, he came in an hour ago,' answer- ed the man. ' When he went abroad, I don't know; for Turilo was first on the post.' ' This is strange-what means this blood-   this- torn dress-this feverish and irregular sleep?' he said, returning and gazing on her. ' She has been abroad-but whither and where?' A shadow-the faintest tint of a shadow of half-formed suspicion passed across the mirror of his thoughts. It took no shape-it hardly came before it vanished. It was so transient that it could hardly be said to have existed. He would not acknowledge it, himself. ' o, no! She can know no one! She is as pure and true to my love as yonder fair moon to the earth. I wrong her by the half-thought. ' Yet what can have taken her forth, and where t has she been. and how engaged, that this blood t should be upon her hand and cheek?  It may be it is her own, and she has been wounded.' 'Enrique-dear En-En-rique!' she mur- mured, so softly just at this moment, that only a lover's ear could have detected the words. 'There it is!   She loves me always and w murmurs my name in her sleep. I will not w question her.  I will not seem to doubt her. T I will wait till she shall voluntarily relate to me whither she has been! How fair she is! What he princely beauty reigns upon her brow   where trn should sit. a regal coronet. What, sentry?  Do you not hear galloping?' he cried, going to the h, door.  ' Yes, senor, but it is at a distance.'  s ' You should keep awake.  We are in a wild no country, and know not who are our enemies.' no Help!   Save me! Enrique!  Protect me!' tin He flew to the side of the sleeping girl, ex- pecting to find her in peril, when ha saw she she had called out in her dreams.        see ' Poor child! Some  evil hath taken hold on d thy spirit! Thy sleep is unhappy, I will wake in  thee; for it is near time I  sought out Don Ha Pelayo, and wake him, to go with him to seek the gold. Garcilaso!  Garcilaso! Wake, Gar. cilaso!  She hears me not. I will call her by Bal her own name. Mariana,' he said, softly.  She started at once, and opening her eyes wildly regarded him with an amazed stare, in thot which fear was most marked. But recognlizng the him, she smiled and sighed with great relief, face Cget      eif ae   lar and extending both her hands towards him, she er. burst into tears, and sobbing said: e  ' ' Thank the blessed virgin; you are by me of once more! But--but-' and she hung her of head upon his hands in the abandonment of des- ne pair. it  ' Yes, I am by thee, dearest. It is Enrique's Id arm that enfolds thee! It is Enrique's breast that pillows thy eheek!' i  'Blessing--blessing unspeakable!' n   ' Why, what aileth thee, love?  You seem t overcome with sorrow-nay, with deeper than re sorrow. I watched thee sleeping, and seeing )d thee uneasy and murmuring words-' ' What words? quickly tell me, what words? Did I tell anything ;' she almost demanded with authority. ' Only my name, sweet-my name!' a  'Thank God.' 'Thou hast in thy heart no secret that thou d wouldst hide from me, that thou shouldst fear t words would betray it to my ear-that I know. Thou hast been abroad, I see!' e She did not raise her head. She concealed t her face in her hands, and lay on his bosom trembling like a  leaf. ) 'Nay, I will not ask thee aught. If thou hast sorrow, thou knowest where to confide it- in my sympathizing bosom--when thou wilt. Something hath happened to thee! But I  will not pry into the sacred grief that seems ready to overwhelm thee. Cheer up, sweet! It is near time to depart!' 'From hence, as soon as may be, Enrique,' she said, with an involuntary shudder, that seemed to creep through her whole frame. '  We shall leave at sunrise, dearest,' he said, in a cheery tone. ' The lugger will take us to Havana in a   day, with a fair breeze.' 'I will pray that it may be fair!' ' Wilt thou remain here, while I go and- see Balco i' ' Do not leave me, Enrique.' ' Whb something hath sceared thee, lady, till thou art as timid as a fawn. Come with me, then; but carry thy head up, and act the bold- faced boy, in keeping with thy costume.'  &#xD;<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7455-00000025"/> 'I will--I will try. I forgot,' she said, in tones almost plaintive.' Accompanied by the disguised maiden, Don Enrique went to seek Baleo, for the morning was already breaking in the east. CHAPTER VII. ' The echoing cannon rend the azure arch, And every pulse doth warlike time beat high.' ' E now transfer the scenes of our story ^  to the vicinity of the city of Havana. The time is the night but one following that on which we have left Don Enrique, about making preparations for his departure in the bucoaneer's lugger. The hour is just after sunset, and dur- ing that twilight gloom which fills the interval between the close of day and the rising of the moon shortly after its full. The sentry on that part of the battlements of Moro castle which looked Seaward, had seen, as the sun went down, a two-masted lugger stand- ing in towards the port, at about two leagues dis- tance. He cast towards it from time to time, a careless glance, and paced his round. At length it could be no more seen, fading as it did into the night haze. A larger vessel would have fixed his eye, and been reported to his com- manding officer, and her position and bearing at dark would have been accurately taken; but among the ten-score fishing craft of all rigs and sizes, that were constantly coming in and goin gi out of Havana, sailing up and down the coast, a  single lugger was not likely to draw particular attention, without showing some peculiar mark to engender suspicion. At the distance from the Moro castle, at which night overtook the craft in question, it was not easy to discover the unusual number of men that crowded her deck; or to discern the six guns at her ports, and her long gun amidships; nor to detect the rakish style of her masts and general tournure,; other- wise the sentry would have manifested less in- difference. Nevertheless, this lugger was the most important vessel that was in sight from Moro castle that day, or had entered Havana   for several days. -It:.go:ntained a special mes- senger from Spain to the council of conspirators, and carried, therefore, more treason against the  government, than was in a whole fleet of ordinary merchantmen. On board of it, were Don En- rique and Garcilaso. - Until the sun set the buccaneer captain, Don Pedro Alvados, pointed out to his distinguished passenger the prominent points along the shore. The latter was filled with admiration at the war- like aspect of the Moro castle, as it sat upon its terrace of rock, in the glory of its strength, like a second Gibraltar. The maiden, whose '^sad- ness yet remained, but not visible to any eye but Don Enrique's, stood by his side, and enjoyed with him the sight of their long-wished-for haven, with its towers, its battlements, its spires and turrets, its tall cocoa-trees and palms, one and all glittering in the going down sun, as if covered with a snow of golden dust. Ships, both of war and commerce, brigs, shallops, sloops and luggers, yachts and barges, fishing craft and piroques, were in constant motion, either going in or coming out, gliding up the coast or down, or riding at anchor, rocked gen- tly on the billowy bosom of the restless sea. The lugger stood in towards the Moro! as if it intended to enter the harbor, but hauling her wind after dark, she steered for a semaill cove about a mile and a quarter to the eastward of the castle, at a point where a pier and a few houses showed that there was a usual landing place.  ' I will leave you here, senor,' said Don AL vados, as they came close in under the shadows of the shore. ' It is but a short walk across the tongue of land on which the castle stands, to the shore of the harbor opposite thecity; and to get there, you will find skiffs and boats in plenty, and men to row you across for a medio.' The lugger now rounded to, within a few fathoms of the pier-head, and lowered her sails. After she had come to anchor, Don Enrique and Garcilaso took leave of the buccaneer, but not without a handsome reward for his services, and were rowed to the shore. ' You will do your best to ascertain what has   become of Don Pelaryo?' said Don Enrique, as thae boat left the ,side of the vessel. ' I fear some foul play hath happened to him.' ' I will have search and inquiry fully made for him, senor,' answered the buccaneer; 'In my opinion, he has gone somewhere on the island to look up some of his money, which I know he buried years ago!' ' It is very possible,' answered Don Enrique; ' and I hope it is nothing woire; but as we wait ed, for him till nearly noon, he should have been with us earlier. But I hope for the best, and if you hear any news, good or evil, at once send word to me. I have given you directions how a message will find me.' The little boatin which Don Enrique disem- barked from the lugger, was run in to the rocky steps of the pier-head, and he sprung to land, followed byor rather assisting Gareilaso. They sthod on the lanaing-place, until- the boat reach- ed thelugger, and they saw the latter weigh and 1 stand out to sea again. For a few moments, Don Enrique remained , where the boat had left him. A feeling of lone- liness came over him, at being left alone with only Gareiftso as a companion, on an unknown i shore, and among scenes wholly new to him. i He felt now forcibly the responsibility of his situation as an ambassador, and the importance a of the events which depended on his movements. Whilehe was deliberating in what course he ii should direct his steps from the pier, it struck him how easily a landing of an invading force X might be ,effeeted at that point by night, and tl forming directly under the walls of the Moro n march and surprise it. The castle was in full sight, filling half the sky at the west of him with its hmge, castellated bulk. Hereand there, tl from amid the gloomy surface of its lofty walls, sparkled a wath-light. The jagged and serrated profile outline of its embrasured battlements ox could easily be made out. Don Enrique gazed a upon and thought how soon Cuba would change hands, if that castle were once taken.  in 'That, Mariana,' he said, pointing to the Cuban fortress, 'that castle del Moro is the in key to the island. Whoever is mater there, ti 4   as ruleS Cuba. We must take that stronghold or ear we can effect nothing. , But I must not waste time here. Iought to be safe in the city before ,de midnight.' I  At this moment a man approached them, and nd lifting his cap, asked if he could serve them. he 'I see, senores,' he said, in the dialect of a Cuban fisherman; j 'that you have just been e; landed from a vessel, and perhaps would have is a guide to show you to some place of lodging?' en  ' You are right, my good man,' answered Don Id Enrique. 'Is there a village there where I see Id the roofs amid the trees?' w  ' Si, senor, a small one, and there is a posada there, where you will find such entertainment n- as you require.' y  ' Nay, we will not ask you to show us an inn, a, but we will pay you to direct us the nighest y way to gain the city?' h-  ' That is easy, senor.

'0, yes; I do not reprove thee. I know thou hast a' heavy secret at thy heart.' ' Thou shalt know it ere long, Enrique.' ' Have I sought it from thee, dearest?

Be sure the sentries of the castle will not discover us; and if they did, wpd rdlytake note of a single boat coming in o} going. out of a large mart like Havana. There must be craft moving about at all hours of the night.' 'Yet, if the fears of the government are aroused, as we learn 'they are, it is possible that the strictest watch may be kept, and every small boat compelled to answer for its going or com- ing.' ' This system of espionage can hardly have yet' been establi-shied. Here is our man. If there were danger he *vould scarcely venture.' ' He might go safely, where you would be meshed with dangers, Don Enrique.' ' It will be no safer to walk--and besides, it will be too wearisome for thee; and at last we will have to cross the harbor in a boat. This is our safest course.' 'I always submit to your better judgment, Enrique.' They were soon seated in the boat, which was one lf those rude Cuban piroques, capable of holding only four persons. The fisherman, who wore a red shirt and a blue Sicilian cap with the tassel hanging over his ear, taking the small oars began to pull along the shore, keeping close within its shadows. Sometimes he approached so near, that the blade of his inside oar touched the rocks, and sometimes the pending branch of a tree swept across their faces. Once or twice an idle loiterer on the beach, some homeward- bound laborer, hailed from mere wantonness. Once they heard the sound of a guitar, accom- panying a manly voice from an habitation half hidden in foliage. The dip of the oar startled two or three mocking birds from their leafy perches, and flittering away to loftier branches they filled the air with the sweetest melody, ti, the boat was beyond hearing. Once a sound of a distant bugle, which the fisherman said came from the city, fell softly with dreamy indistinct- ness upon their ears. As they drew nearer the foot of the rock which was'orbwned by the castle, the low mur- our of the ocean: well, breaking gently against ,the elinff Warded them :how wildly they woid lash and roar agitated by a tempest.   'Yes, senores,' said the fisherman, 'I have seen the waves in a storm break and send their spray seventy feet high. But we must not speak much here, or else very low. We are coming under the walls, and voices easily go up into the air.' ' And would they stop your boat, fisherman?' asked Garcilaso, ' if they saw you?' ' To be sure, senor. There is an order pass- ed lately, that every boat coming in and out after gun-fire, shall be stopped and detained, unless they have a passport or the pass-word. This is done to guard against some American' officers that the captain general is afraid will land here, and teach we islanders how to free ourselves.' 'Has the gun fired yet, hombre?' asked Don Enrique. ' Not yet, senor; and I am in hopes we will get past the guard-boats before it does.' It fires at nine o'clock.' ' Then row, good fellow, fast and hard,' said Garcilaso. 'Thou shalt have a golden carlos, if thou wilt bring us up to the city in safety.' 'That I will do, senor, or I would not have undertaken it; I have bee'f in and out twice since the order, -and no ,one has troubled me, because they bould not see me. There it is!' As he spoke, a light like the most vivid light- ning illumined sky and sea, castle and shore, and displayed for an instant the outline of the city. It was the flash of a large gun from the battery of the castle directly above their heads. The roar of the ordnance seemed to shake the cliff to its foundation. Its echoes rolled across the water from- the castle to the city and back again in successive repetitions like thunder. They had not ceased, when another flash from a fortress opposite discharged a gun, and a third )and fourth followed from ships of war, till the whole atmosphere was blazing, and the air re- verberating. The sublimity and novelty of the scene caus- ed Mariana to stand upon her feet. 'Down, senor, down, if you please;' cried the fisherman, in a warning tone. ' We must now be still as death., This is a dangerous   row; but what danger will not a poor fisher- man venture upon for five dollars?' The glare of light which proceeded from the burning powder, had enabled the quick eye of Don Enrique, to take in the main features of the scene which surrounded him. The Moro was towering above them so that the sentries seemed to be almost perpendicularly over their heads. They had rowed so far round the point of rook on which it stood, that the city was full in view before him. He saw that the harbor was filled with shipping, and among them several vessels of war. He discovered that two line of battle- ships were at anchor so near the entrance of the port, that there was left but a little space for a vessel to pass between them and the Moro. He also caught a glimpse of three guard-boats with soldiers on board rowing about on the alert. 'By the mass! we have a perilous passage before us to reach the city,' he said, to the fish- erman. ' It is true, senor, if you have no passport, as I suppose not?' ' No. You must do your best to steer free from the dangers. Thou shalt be well paid if we are landed in safety on one of the city quays.' ' If you will trust to me, senor, I think I shall get through unseen.  The breeze that now freshens from   the sea, will make the waves noisy about the rocks, and we shall not be so c quickly heard if our oars mako a chance rattle ] in the row-locks.  I will keep close in under e the cliff.'  'As close as you can, my man,' answered Don Enrique, who saw how closely watched the- entrance of the port was, and  the full danger a that attended an entrance to it, even of a small boat. The fisherman now pulled as close under the fortress as he could, and crept around it with noiseless motion.  The cries of the sentries' 'Alerte,' could be heard above their heads, while from the guard ship, not a&amp;. hundred t fathoms on their right, was heard the measured footfall of the sentinel, as he paced the fore- a castle. Breathless and silently they were rowing on e    r until they had got nearly by the Moro, when they were startled by a sudden hail as if from e the clouds. Both Don Enrique and Gareilaso )f looked round, believing they were discovered, e when they saw a vessel under full sail standing s into the mouth of the harbor not far astern of d them, and just outside the castle point. Again I. the hail was repeated, and louder than before. k  'Ho! the schooner ahoy!' was shouted from 7 the battlements. 1  'We are not seen, Mariana.  It is not our- s selves, but that vessel standing in ;' said Don - Enrique, not a little relieved at finding another e. than their little boat was the object of the sen- a tries' noisy salutations. ' The schooner, ahoy! heave to, or we fire 1 into you!' was repeated from the castle in fierce tones. The schooner, which drew each moment 3 nearer and nearer, under the impulse of a fine sea-breeze, that had been strengthening since sundown, still kept on her course as strait as an arrow shot from a bow, starting neither tack nor sheet. ' The man who commands her is mad to rush F on that way,' said the fisherman. ' They will blow him out of water. It, is well we are up into the  harbor so far! See that, senores! What did I  tell you!' The exclamation of the boatman had  been caused by the glare of a discharged piece of ord. nance at the schooner from one of the depress- ed guns of the battery above her. By its light, the schooner was distinctly seen. 'The Bel Isabell' exclaimed Don Enrique. ' It is my  own schooner! She is coming in as a  prize !' ' Did you see, sir?' said the fisherman, almost in a tone of horror. ' See what?' 'That there was not a  soul on board.' 'Nol' 'See, now!  There is, another gun I   two, three, four of them! They will sink her.' ' I see now! Her decks are without a man, as we left her,' cried Don Enrique, in amate-. ment, as the light of the cannonading whidh now opened on the vessel enabled him to   *be her distinctly.  &#xD;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7455-00000027"/> 'Perhaps she has been sailing about on the ocean this way alone for two days, and this wind brings her in in this fashion,' was Gar- cilaso's answer. ' It must be so! It is amazing. And see how she stands on, and not a ball of all this firing touches her spars!' ' It is a phantom ship, senor,' cried the fisher- man, crossing himself, and pulling strait away for the land into a crevice of the rocks, upon which he sprung with terror, and fell on his knees, uttering at every flash of the cannon Ave Marias. The terror of the fisherman placed the party in security; for the guard-ship now opened a cross fire upon the schooner, several of the balls from the guns of which rattled against the cliff and then rebounded into the water near them. Don Enrique, thoughtless of the danger, was wholly absorbed in watching the Bel Isabel. As the cannonade did not stop her, blue lights and Bengal lights were sent up ftom the castle, which east a lurid day over the whole harbor. The schooner was rendered by it clearly visible; every rope defined, every spar delineated with the clearness of noon-day. It was now clearly apparent to every eye, both from the Moro and the guardship, as well as to the eyes of Don Enrique, that no person was on board. To his surprise the firing suddenly ceased, as if by a simultaneous order from the officers in command of the ship and castle; but there was only a moment left him for wonder at this cessation,  for the air was rent with cries of-- ' A fire-ship! A fire-ship!' Tnstantly there arose a loud chorus of voices from the decks of the Spanishfleet. A hundred  orders were given to resist its approach. . Suddenly an idea entered the mind of Don  Enrique, an idea bold as it was novel.  ' Fisherman,' said he, ' put me on board that schooner, and I will make your fortune.'  'Done, Sir,' answered the man. 'But you i must be responsible, senor, if I come to harm. i  I will do anything for money--but I must live * for I have a wife and children.'  ' There is no danger. Dob you not see the    terror she spreads in the fleet, as she is enter- ing the harbor?' ' Why don't they sink her?'  ' For fear of blowing her up. Quick--to your oars! I know the vessel to be perfectly harm- less.' 'If she is harmless to you, she is tot me. What wilt thou give me?' ' Five hundred pesos!' ' Good! Bueno!' answered the man, spring- ing into the boat and pulling strait for the schooner, which was now right abreast of them, and not eighty yards off. It was a strange spectacle to see this inanimate thing pressing up the harbor, into the bosom of its thickly anchor- ed shipping, and spreading terror and dismay in her path as she advanced. Some of the war- vessels were hoisting sails to get out of her way; others slipped their cables; and Don Enrique saw the very Spanish frigate which had chased him across the Atlantic, weighing anchor to run from her. After rowing sufficiently far out from the shore to be seen by the officers of the guardship, and by those who were gazing down from the castle, Don Enrique rose up, and waving his cloak, cried in a loud voice: ' I will board her, and steer her out!' ' Ay, ay! Bravo! Bravissimo!' was shout- ed in response by a hundred voices. The next moment he stood upon the familiar deck. Every tack and sheet was in its place; and the helm lashed as he had left it, forty-eight hours before, eighty miles to the eastward of Havana. He took the helm from its lashings and as he grasped it, he felt like the Arabian, who once more mounts the back of his restored courser. A loud shout rent the air, as a Ben- gal light showed him standing there with the fearless air of its master. By his orders, the fisherman aided by Gar- eilaso, eased off the fore and main tacks and she obeyed her helm, and went about as grace- fully as a lady in a waltz, and lay'with her head pointing seaward. It took but a moment to haul aft, tack and sheet, and shape her course close to the wind. The success of this manoeuvre   called forth the loudest clamors of applause from land and decks. The schooner soon got head- way on her new course, and in ten minutes the Moro and harbor was left behind, and the beau- tiful schooner was bounding away as free as the winds. As the outlines of the land faded, and the sounds m the harbor grew fainter, Don En. rique lay the schooner to, and called a council of war. ' Who will not say this has been well done, Garcilaso?' he said, with a merry laugh. It was but the impulse of a thought that prompted me to take this means to recover my vessel. It was a risk, but we have sueeeeded. Now, it re- mains what is to be done with her! I have no 1 time to spare to run down to Cape de Piedras, and place herthere with Balco, nor men enough to manage her, hey, Garcilaso! Look you, sir t fisherman; you have shown courage--' ' I am a poor coward, seaor; it was the gold  you offered, orI could never have done it.' a 'Well, it is no matter which. Now I want to tell you, my man, that this vessel was mine. sl I was forced to leave her, being chased by an enemy, two days ago. You saw me land only al in a boat. Well, now, to-night, as my good fortune would have it, just as I was poking like a thief into Havana, in your miserable boat, in as walks my lady like a queen, who. has been out in taking an airing, and all as I had left her. I sp knew, at once, she was no fire-ship, or I would hardly have trusted myself on board of her.' 'Now, I understand it all, as plain as the sa palm of my hand, noble senor,' answered the fisherman, emphatically.          an ' You have earned your thousand dollars; but I must sell my vessel first to get it.'   tru ' That is true, no doubt, senor.'    shi ' Now I can sell her only in Havana!' ' Which is also true, senor, unless you take al her to the States.,'  ' I can't take her there. Now if I sail into pew Havana  in her to-morrow in open'day, which is  the only way a vessel can go in, for at night they watch sharpest, I shall be recognized by the by frigate that c hased me; she is anchored in port.' ' Es verdad-true as the mass-book of saint ' Pedro, senor 1'               er   rbm  ' Then, my vessel will be lost, and what will ;ad- become of your thousand pesos?' the  ' It looks as if theywould go with the vessel.' au-  'Without doubt, honest piscator.

You will me, then take the helm--' It  ' Si, senor-' ed  ' You will be hailed from the castle-' It  Si, senor--' e  ' You will say that your vessel is the schooner, no that was steering into port last night, alone-' s, ' Yes, my lord--' 'h And that you are the man who rowed out ir to her, and helped get her out of the harbor--' ' Not altogether, senor-' d '  ' But you were enough so.

My lordship's head would be y cut off, if it were known I were a party to it I' ' Ah, then, senor, I will do as you say I' ' ( Yes, by all means I Do not fail to do ex. actly as he commands you,' said Garcilaso, lay- t ing her hand upon the fisherman's arm, and [ speaking with great earnestness. 1' I will, senorito.' ' Or you will lose my head, and your thou- , sand dollars,' remarked Don Enrique, coolly. ' Your lordship's commands shall be obeyed,' answered the fisherman, with deference. ' You are then to represent yourself as the true person who took command of the " fire- ship."' ' ' Yes, yourlordship,' responded the man, with a low bow. ' You are not to allude to me, or any other person, as having aided you.' ' Just so, your lordship.' ' You will claim the schooner as your own, by right of capture.' ' I will, senor, if you say so.' ' To be sure I do. You will then offer to sell her for five thousand pesos.'  ,  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7455-00000028"/> ' It is a sum for a king, your lordship.' ' Of this five thousand, you will retain as your reward-' ' One thousand pesos.' ' Exactly, and the balance--' ' I will pay over to your lordship.' ' I see you understand the whole affair now. Can you carry it out boldly?' ' Do not fear me, senor. I could sell the devil in Havana market, and make no bones of it. if I was to make a thousand hard pesos by the bargain.' ' Very well. We will lay to here until day, and then go into the harbor. I and my com- panion will dress as common seamen, in some of the clothes I find that my'sailors have left be- hind them. You will order us about as your own men, when the boarding officer comes along- side.' ' Si, senor, I will not fail to swear a score and a half of round oaths at both your heads. Do not fear, but that I will do just as you have said.' The schooner remained in the offing until sun- rise, laid to the wind. As the sun rose, Don Enrique waked Garcilaso, who had slept all night, and having arrayed himself and her in the roughest suits of his sailor's clothes that could be found in the forecastle, and given an uncombed look to their heads, and stained their hands with tar, the order was given by him ' to fill away.' The morning was inconceivably glorious. If Havana had appeared fine by the light of the, Bengal lights the evening previous, it now look- ed magnificent. The towers of the Moro castle, which was but four miles distant, glittered like gold in the level beams of the sun, and the spires and turrets of the city were sheathed in a yel. low lustre that outshone gold. Every wave sparkled with beauty, and a score of snow white sails flung back the rays of the morning. The wind was at first baffling, but soon blow- ing off the land, they had to lay close to it, to' lay their course into the harbor. As they drew near the castle, they saw the royal banner of Spain flaunting proudly from its gray battle- ments,- and the glittering muskets of a company   of Spanish troops marching along the ramparts to relieve guard. The same rich flag floated from the mizzen head of a dozen ships of war, anchored inside of the castle. Among them, Don Enrique recognized the frigate from which he had fled across the ocean. As Dona Mariana, looked upon its- dark sides and black spars, her cheek grew pale, and drawing near Don En- rique, she said in a low tone so as not to be overheard by the-fisherman at the helm: ' Are you not risking too much?' ' No, dearest,' he replied; ' I cannot be re- cognized in this guise.' ' But if you should be, all is lost.' 'I do not apprehend any danger.' ' It would have been better not to have board- ed the schooner, when you saw her coming in.' ' Who could resist the temptation, Mariana? I saw at once how it was, that she had been knocked about here and there, till a fair breeze had set her strait for the port. In recovering her, I am well repaid for all risk.' ' But could we not let this fisherman take her in alone, and we leave and go in in his skiff? It still tows astern.' Don Enrique reflected a moment, and then said: 'No.. It was known that -three boarded the schooner last night, and if these suspicious offi- cers do not find three when they come on board, our fisherman will not be able to give a strait account, and will get into trouble. As his com- rades, as common sailors, we can pass with him unsuspected.' ' The virgin grant it may be so,' answered the maiden, starting at the same moment at the report of a cannon. CHAPTER VIII. 'A thousand ducats I 'tis a princely sum.' THE gun which had startled Dona Mariana, and caused her cheek to turn pale, was fired from the Moro castle; but not at the schooner, but to bring to a brig which was en- tering the port half a mile. ahead of the Bel Isabel. The vessel at once obeyed the signal,   and coming into the wind backed her foretopsail and became stationary. A boat from the pier below the castle wall was seen to board her. After a few minutes' detention, the brig squared away again for the port, and the boat returned to the shore.    .  ' And shall we be brought to, and boarded in that manner?' asked Dona Mariana, who had watched this proceeding with deep attention. 'Yes, dearest. But do not fear. You must be at work forward. Take this rope the end of which is ragged and braid it; this I know you can do better than half the seamen. Do not look up unless spoken to, and if you are ques- tioned, reply calmly.' ' I,will do so. But you?'  'I shall not betray myself,' he answered, smiling. The schooner now drew nearer each moment to the formidable castle which stands guard at t the ocean-gates of Havana.   At length from r looking over the bows to see it, they had to look up higher and higher, till it frowned above i them, a vast castellated crag, bristling with a 1 hundred cannon mouths.            c The schooner stood on unnoticed by, a gun, I till Don Enrique began to believe she would r pass unhailed, when all at once from  a turret r above the mast-head a trumpet hailed them: 'What schooner is that          1?' 'The  FiRE-siIip,'  answered the fisherman, whose name was Luis Lobos, in a stentorian 1 tone.                     t ' The schooner that came in last night?' de- r manded the officer with the trumpet. ' Ay, ay, sir!' 'Heave to, and receive a boat.'       y The fisherman brought her shivering into the A wind; and  instantly a barge containing two c officers in brilliant uniforms, one of them an old zi man with a white head, and the other youthful and foppish, put off from the castle landing. It was manned by six oars, and swiftly drew near. A  little distance off, the officer rose up in the a cushioned seats, and checking by a sign the ad- ac vance of the boarding barge, said:     aBI 'Did we   understand you, senor, that this tl   1 was the fire-ship, which came into port last r night, and was so gallantly boarded and carried out?' ' ( Si, senor capitan.' 1  ' Is she safe now?' he asked, with some show of cautious interest in his own personal security.. ' Perfectly, senor capitan. There is now not I a shadow of danger. All the combustibles have had water cast over them in abundance 1' Here i Luis was correct; for the reader will recollect F that the schooner when she left was prepared for an explosion, from which she was only preserved by Coco's too free use of water upon the fuse. These materials with more added to them, Don Enrique now preserved, as they were in order, to give color to the idea, in the eyes of the Spaniards, that she was in truth a fire-ship. The Spanish boarding officer then came up the side, and looked round the deck with an eye that Don Enrique thought was not yet wholly re-assured of security. ' So, then, you are the brave fellow that took this fire-vessel out from among the shipping?' he said, advancing towards Lobos, after casting only a careless glance in the direction of Don En- , rique, who was apparently very busy coiling rigging, and of Garcilaso who was braiding the rope. ' Si, su excelencia,' bowed Lobos, with a mnodest air. ' You are a brave fellow. You risked your life! You ,will be well rewarded by the cap- tain-general. And these are your two com- rades?' ' Yes, your excellency,' 'They will not go unrewarded. What have you discovered in the vessel-that she is diablo Americano?' Here he was shown the heaps o combustibles, and the train leading to the maga- zine, all well saturated with sea-water. ' Was any one below when you boarded her?' ' No, senor.'  ' Very well. There is no doubt of its being a plan to blow us up I You have done a good act. I will take command of the schooner, and anchor up opposite the town, till the pleasure of the general-in-chief shull be known touching her.'  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7455-00000029"/> ' I shall claim her as my prize, your excellen- cy,' answered Lobos, with a firmness that Don Enrique did not expect from him. 'That is a large claim, hombre! Put that will be decided. What his excellency decides,- you must abide by. Stand by, men, to 'nake sail, and take this prize up opposite the quay!' This order was given to his 'own boat's crew, four of whom came on board and helped work the schooner, with the younger officer, while the elderly one having committed the schooner to his charge, got into the boat, though first shut- ting and sealing in a formal manner the cabin door and main hatch. The schooner was now once more under way, but was now steered by a pilot placed at the helm, by the new officer in command. As the harbor was filled with vessels at anchor, and others in motion moving in different directions, it required no little skill to navigate through the narrow spaces left between them. - Lobos saw at a glance his skill would have failed him; and he began to be reconciled to the usurpation which deprived him of his post. ' So, hombres, you thought you would make yourselves famous by boarding the schooner last night,' said the officer, approaching Gar- cilaso. ' No, we thought only of doing what we did,' answered Lobos, promptly; thinking he must answer in all points where there was any dan- ger of exposing his two companions. ' Well, so you claim the schooner?' This inquiry was addressed to Don Enrique. 'Yes, senor.  We  consider it fairly  our prize.' The governor will think differently, you may rest assured,' responded the young lieutenant, sneeringly. ' Well, my lad, you seem to braid well for a fisherman.  How would you like to serve in the queen's ships?' ' I am a poor sailor, and would do poor ser- vice, sir,' she answered quietly, without lifting her eyes. ' They give good wages to light hands; and then there is chance for promotion ;- for we mean   to have a war with the Yankees for meddling with our affairs. This schooner will be our first prize.' 'There is no certainty that it is a Yankee vessel,' said Don Enrique. ' No doubt about it. What other people would send a fire-ship in te burn our navy?' The young man's attention was now demand- ed in giving orders, and Don Enrique and Mariana leaning over the bows, gazed on the shores of the city with deep. interest. All around them were ships of every maritime na- tion. An American sloop of war was on their left, with the cheerful flag of stars and stripes waving freely in the breeze; and on the other side of them was a British. frigate. distinguish- able by her double cross on a blood-red field. The schooner came so near the Spanish frigate, that Don Enrique could distinguish faces that' he well knew, and both he and Garcilaso turn- ed to busy themselves about duties that would conceal their own, lest, under all their disguise, they should be recognized where recognition would be certainly fatal. 'Ave Maria!  Mira!' cried a voice from the quarter-deck of the frigate, as the schooner passed slowly along within twenty fathoms; ' that is the schooner we have been chasing and which escaped us!' At these words, Don Enrique's heart sprung into his mouth, and he half repented that he had not continued on into the city in the little boat the evening before, instead of placing him- self in such danger as now seemed to involve him. Garcilaso would have fainted, but for the re-assuring glance filled with warning which met her faltering eyes. From the exclamations that followed, Don Enrique knew that a score of eyes must be con- centl'ated upon the deck of the schooner. ' It is the same,' was the reply of half a doz- en voices.         - 'EHo, there, sir boarding officer!' came a commanding  hail from  the  Spanish poop. ' What schooner is that?' ' The fire-ship, senor,' answered the young officer. 'These are the men who boarded her,   and took her out, and having deluged the com- bustibles, have brought her in this morning. I am to anchor opposite the upper battery.' ' Ay, ay-brave fellows!' was the hearty response of the hailer, who was an officer -of high rank. ' But she looks as much like our chase as one thumb nail is like another,' he ad- ded to his lieutenants around' him. ' It is the identical vessel, senor,' was the positive response. 'They have sold her or turned her themselves into a fire-ship.' ' I will inquire about this,' was the answer which reached Don Enrique's ears. He then heard an order given for a boat to be manned to go to the upper battery. ' Did you hear that, Don Enrique?' asked Mariana, in a tone of fear. ' Yes. We must manage to leave the vessel before the boat comes up with her. As we sail now, we can keep ahead of the barge. I will speak a word to the fisherman.' ' Mon amigo Lobos,' he said aside to the fish- erman. 'I wish you to command me and my comrade to take your boat and go ashore on some errand. It will not be safe for us to remain here a moment after they anchor the schooner.' ' Good,' answered Luis. And turning away he paced the deck two or three minutes and then stopping, said to the officer: ' I see you have taken command of my schooner, but you don't take command of my men, too?' ' Not I. You and they can do as you please,' answered the officer, carelessly rolling his papil- lito between his thumb and finger before smoking. 'I shall stay till I am turned out, be alsured of that, my brave officer,' answered Lobos, with spirit; ' but I want to send my men ashore for something to eat. Not a bottle of sour wine- not a leaf of stale bread to be found on board here, to say nothing of sweet wine and fresh bread. Hallo I you men, mine!' 'Senor,' responded Don Enrique, running towards him, and waiting like an inferior, to be further ordered. Mariana followed his exam. pie in every respect. 'You take my boat, which is towing astern--'   'Yes-yes, Don Luis.' 'And-why don't you listen, you rogues both I Do you want the strappado with a falar, do and a contrabando, to make you smart?' ' We only wait your orders, master Lobos." ' Thou shalt have them. Carromba! You are inclined to get tipsy ashore-' '0, senor-' interposed Don Enrique, apol- ogetically. ' Not a word. It is true. It is known from the Moro to Cardenas, that I have two of the. veriest wine-bibbing rogues in the island o' Cuba. Now, listen to me, asses I First, take my boat! Second and twicely, get into it. Third and thricely, pull Strait ashore in it! Fourthly and quadrupulously, buy me three bot- tles of best Vin Malaga, and four rolls of fresh bread with the baker's cross just stamped on it. Fifthly and quintuplously, see that you do not suck the cork out and gobble the wine and come aboard tipsy as the pope's two owls, that got drunk as Turks chewing opium. Yost thou hear, varlets " ' ' We will do just as you say, or take our heads off,' answered Don Enrique, obsequiously. ' And come hither-I have a word to say to thee, touching my mistress, which is too private a matter for the world's wide ears.' He then took Don Enrique by the ear, and led him forward. ' Hark, ye, senor; have I done it well?' he said, with evident self-approval. 'None could do so well. You have our thanks.' ' Now, where shall I send the four thousand pesos?  You forgot to tell me.' ' True.  Dost thou know where lives a cer- tain Don Baltazar, a rich Jew of this city?' 'I have sold fish at his house, senor 1' ' Good.  If thou wishest to find me, go to him with more fish in thy basket, and as thou sellest to him, ask him if he thinks that Enrique ,Espons would not like to purchase also. He will then recognize thee, as my friend. But to be sure of seeing me, for in these suspicious times, the Jew may doubt whether to hold com- munication with me, you may show him a ring  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7455-00000030"/> which I have and will give thee!' He sought for it about his clothing, but in vain. ' I have lost it. Garcilaso, give me the ring to thy cross, It will answer, and I will replace it by a richer one.' The maiden changed color as quick as light. ning, and bent her head to conceal her emotion, while she drew from the bosom of a jacket a small solid ring with a diamond set, and of pecu- liar construction. She gave it to Don Enrique with a trembling hand. Without witnessing her emotion, he placed the ring in the hand of the fisherman, and said: ' This will obtain access to me, if you show it to Don Baltazar.  Make the sale at once-by to-morrow, if possible. The captain-general will hardly interfere, for the government can have no claim on the vessel. But if you have any trouble let me know.' This Lobos promised to do, and Don Enrique, drawing the skiff alongside of the gangway, placed two oars in it, and then seeing Garcilaso safely get in, he sprang upon the stern thwart and cast off from the schooner. As it was still moving on, he  dropped astern at once, and it. was with a feeling of relief that he found him-; self off from her decks, where he xpeected or feared that each moment he might be made -a  prisoner; but he thought less of himself than he a did of Dona Mariana's danger. .  ' We  will now soon be in security, Mariana,' he said to the maiden, whose countenance be- a trayed her joy at having quitted the Bel Isabel c undiscovered.  ' You take the bow oar, and I t will take the after one.'          n 'The frigate's barge, Enrique!' she sudden- d ly exclaimed, pointing to a  well-manned boat h that was coming in their direction. ' Yes, I  see her! We are not a moment too I early in quitting the schooner, nor have we a s moment to spare.  Pull together, and I will soon place these brigs and schooners ahead be- r tween the barge and us. They do not pull p strait for us, but for the schooner, which is al- c ready coming to, to anchor.'        fi 'The saints be thanked that they do not find tl us on board of her,'- said Mariana, with deep oi ei   it gratitude sparkling in her eyes, the beauty of e which not even her rough disguise could di- 3, minish. 'r If we could not have left her in the skiff, I should have sprung over with you, and taken to Lt swimming. But we shall soon be in safety! t, See! we have already two vessels between us a and the boat. It does not notice us, but is in- - tent only on boarding the schooner.' e  The skiff containing Don Enrique and the ; maiden being propelled by willing hands, soon f got so far within the fleet of anchored crafts that it lost sight both of the schooner and barge.-- t Before them was a small pier, surrounded by r numerous small boats, mostly fishermen'scraft. I Further up was a larger pier, on which sentries were pacing up and down with muskets at their shoulders.  The former being the most obscure, Don Enrique pulled into that, and ran the bow of his boat between two  others, that were pre- cisely like it in construction. ' Hola!' cried a fisherman, who was smoking his cigar in the stern of one of them, I you come in comrades as if los Yankos were after you! Ahah! This is Lobos's boat! Where is he, amigos?' 'He is aboard of a schooner where we left him, comrade, to transact some affairs. We go up town to make purchases; and wilt thou look after our craft till we come back?' 'To   make purchases?  Carramba! Where are thy fish wherewith to buy thy purchases, comrade?   Hast thou credit, amigo mio?' and the man laughed at the idea of a Cuban fisher- man's having credit, or being so before-hand a day as to be able to- buy without the fish in hand.' 'Nay, but we have a little money,' answered Don. Enrique, in his new dialect; ,'we don't spend all we make in wine--not we!' This reply caused a derisive laugh among the reckless and idle fellows that lounged oithe pier-head; and Don Enrique, followed by Gar- cilaso, after securing the boat, walked away, at first with a slow and indifferent gait, but when they reached the street which crossed the head of the quay, where a sentry stood, they quick- ened their pace.   The soldier looked at them with a careless glance, but demanded no pass-word, as they, I feared he would; and with hearts lighter than t they had been for many an hour past, the two ] adventurers took their way up the public tho- ( roughfare into which they had entered.    t At length our two wanderers, having travers- z ed two of the streets of the city, came to a point a where three narrow lanes met and joined the street they were in, like three lesser rivers flow-  ing into one greater. Here Don Enrique paus-  ed, and drew from his pocket a card, which he, examined attentively, Dona Mariana looking over his shoulder. ' So far, Mariana, we have followed our direc-  tions right. Here are the three diverging lanes marked which we have-- come to.  We must take-' ' The centre one, Enrique.' ' Yes, the centre one. - That will bring us to the mansion of DonBaltazar. Let us proceed.' ' Willingly, for now that- we are near the end of our pilgrimage, I Tfeel more impatient than when more remote from it. What do you look at?' ' It is nothing-let us walk on!' ' Nay; I heard a name that--   And those men are reading a placard on which I see your own name!' she cried quickly, as she followed the direction of his eye, which was resting on a placard pasted on a guard-house at the cornerof the three streets. ' Then I will not conceal the fact, since you have also discovered so much. Let me go across and see what. this is, while you walk slow- ly forward. What, dearest, are you going to fail in courage now? Must we not expect these things?' ' Go--go-seewhat it means, Enrique! Let me know the worst,' she said, with a face as white as the marble itself. ' I will walk on if you, say so, but I shall feel better to read also, and learn all that it can convey to you. Un- certainty is more unendurable than the heaviest reality.' 'Then let us cross over together and know what it is.'   The placard in question had evidently been put up that morning, and not long before, for the paper was still damp with the fresh paste. Four or five idle soldiers with side arms were engaged in reading it, the most learned among them interpreting to his comrades. Two citi- zens, also a priest in an old greasy cassock, and. a woman, peered over the soldiers' heads. Don Enrique drew near, and saw that it was a proclamation signed by the captain-general, and issued in the name of and by the royal au- thority, in the'most formal style and manner, setting forth that a certain Spanish noble of high rank, and allied to tne crown family, had prov- ed traitor to the throne, by forming'an alliance with the traitor Don Carlos, the usurper, and that he was now in the island of Cuba, or about to arrive here, having been sent here by the said Don Carlos for the purpose of aiding and abetting the revolutionary separation of the island aforesaid from the crown of Spain : That the said noble, whose name was Don Enrique Garcia de Espana, was accompanied by a prin- cess of the royal house of Castile, whom, by po- tions and necromancy, he had prevailed upon to fly with him. Whereas, five thousand pesos re- ward is hereby offered by the government for the arrest of the said Don Enrique Garcia, and Ihis safe disposition into the hands of the c6nsti- tuted authorities of Cuba, and five thousand fpesos fow the arrest, and safe disposition of the Princess Mariana Garcilla Isabella de Campobel- lo, princess of Arragon and Castile, so that no harm can come to the bodies of either of them. This proclamation was signed by the captain- general, and bore the arms of Spain. ' Por el diablo P' said a soldier who was read- ing it, ' here is a fortune to ba made at once, did t one know just where to find these two runaways! 3 Ten thousand duros! El sacraments! But f somebody is going to bed poor, and wake up , rich.' - This princess must be a great lady,' relnark- it ed another. ' By the toe of the Pope, I never heard of or saw a woman that was worth cinco v silver pesos to bring her back if she ran away.' ' Malo cabeza! what a thick head thou hast,  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7455-00000031"/> Juan; dost thou not know princesses are made of better clay than common ladies,' remarked a third. ' Silence, senors,' called out a bustling little baker who at this moment came up; let us hear what the brave Sergeant Malconas will please to read to us.' CHAPTER IX. 'A Jew! then he hath gold and loveth usury.' V  HE sergeant then read in a formal tone as ]&amp;  follows, but not without stopping to spell out the long words; but orthography among the Spanish soldiers of the army of defence is not carried to that perfection which the purity of the Spanish language usually demands. ' The height of said Garcia de Espana is six feet, or thereabouts, erect and haughty. His age is twenty-five; his Keyes dark hazel, well opened, and piercing, but usually tempered by t a smile. His nose is aquiline, his forehead , high, brows  well and evenly arched, and his  mouth finely formed, but partly hidden by a - rich brown mustache. There is a scar on his left temple, received in battle, and his voice is round and resolute. His tread is martial, and his whole bearing decidedly military.' ' Bueno carramba!' cried several of the t crowd;   ' he is a buen caballero, a proper gen- j tleman!'  ' Hist! here is a description of the woman.' P ' Listen, hombres all--hear what is said about tl the princess,' called out the little baker. tl '  The Princess Dona Mariana is of less stat- I1 ure, being about five feet three, with a  deep of brown eye, large and expressive; her forehead ci fair; her hair brown, tinged with a golden light; cl her figure faultless in its symmetry, and her al hands and  feet white and very small. Her in voice is low and musical, and the carriage of her of head is spirited. It is possible they may as- th sume disguises; and all strangers are therefore st to be closely observed.' '   Maria! but she is as proper a princess as he er is proper a  knight,' said the baker.   we This sentiment was echoed by the crowd,   le which by this time had increased to many per d sons. . Don Enrique, who had stood opposite the placard while it was read, and who almost le fancied every eye would recognize him, touched or Dona Mariana, and by a glance directed her to e follow him. With an assumed lameness, a bent back, and an awkward gait, he left the spot, followed by the maiden, who assumed the rolling gait of a fisherman. In a short space they were beyond the bounds of the crowd, and walking down the s centre street of the three already mentioned.- 1 They traversed it full a square before a word a was uttered by  either. Then Don  Enrique, t finding no one followed, stopped till Mariana f came up, for he saw she was trembling in every limb. ' We have escaped!' she said with emotion. ' Yes; it was a  fearful risk to put you to, Mariana. It seems the frigate has heralded our approach. It was this I feared, and hence my anxiety to reach Havana before her. But we owe gratitude to Heaven for what we have seen -for fore warned is fore-armed.' ' I feared you would be recognized every moment.' ' No! I could scarcely recognize myself in this fashion of dress and smeared visage; but by the rood! I feared for thee, for thy eyes looked just the very eyes the rogue read about in the placard! If he had turned round and looked in thine, he would have sworn they answered to them, man or woman, and would have arrested thee on the spot. But we are safely rid of them. It can't be far to go before we come to the casa of Don Bazaltar. Let me see; the map of the city here says this is the street, and here is the cross of ink on the map which indicates his abode.' He then folded up the chart, and walk- ing rapidly onward, came to a house, the front. of which was a little nearer than the others in the street, which was principally occupied by shops crowded together, where fruit, apparel, and jewelry were sold, and where money-chang- ers, in glittering eyes and thick oriental beards, were sitting.    ' Don Enrique threaded his way along this   narrow avenue, and came in front of a shop over which were two keys crossed. It was the casa of a jeweller, and the whole exterior was mean, as if the occupant barely gathered a subsistence from his wretched occupation. ' This is our place,' said Don Enrique, as he stopped before the door, which was ajar. ' Come in with me, Mariana. We are now safe.' With these words, Don Enrique tapped light- ly on the door. The pair of dark, glittering eyes advanced from the darkness within, and were found to be set in the head of a short, round-shouldered man, without any neck at all, and a nose beaked like an eagle's. His beard was grisly and bushy, and his ears enormously, large, and standing out from his head as if he were a curious and eager listener. He wore a shabby coat of velvet, once green, but now a dingy brown, and of -the fashion of a score of years before; a red waistcoat was buttoned, to his chin, which rested on the collar. He was probably forty years of age. ' Vat you vantsh dere, hey?' he demanded, in a guttural voice, and speaking as if to infe- riors, which the costume of the guests seemed to mark them to be. ' I shay, vat you vant to haf?' ' Is this the abode of Don Baltazar, the rich Jew of Havana?' asked Don Enrique, with a respectful bow, and touching his cap, as if he were indeed the humble sailor his costume in- dicated. 'Vell, vot if it ish! vat you vant wid him?' demanded the Jew, in an impatient, if not an- gry manner, as if it were his natural way to talk so to all below him, a fashion that many vulgar men, Jew and Gentile, have. ' I have business with him.' ' You vill make do you busineshwit me, den. Don Baltazar newer trouble himself with such peoples. I dosh all for him. Vat you vant wit me, I shay?' Don Enrique felt he would like marvellously well to lift the man by the two ears and knock his black, shocky head against the lintel across his door, but he restrained the impulse, and answered;   ' My business can't be arranged with you.- Here is a gold piece.' The Jew's eyes sparkled at the sight. 'Take it!  The big mouth of the Israelite moved its lips into the shape of a smile of satisfaction, as his bony, dark hand closed over it. ' Now go to Don Baltazar, a-nd place in his hand this little parcel I' 'To pe shure, senors!' answered the man with a bow. ' To pe shure. You tid not tell me you haf a package.' ' Tell him the bearer waits here.' 'Juana-hisse, Juano!' called the Jew, to some one in the rear of the shop; and a young negro made his appearance. ' You remains here vhile I goes ant speaks to Don Baltazar.' The Israelite then placed the gold piece in his pocket with great care, and taking the small parcel in his hand, left the shop by the rear.- Don Edrique and his companion stepped within the door, and partly closed it as before, in order to avoid any chance of being noticed by passers by; and this temporary security, after what they had passed through, was not a little relief to Senorita Mariana. The shop in which they were was partly for the sale of jewelry, partly a place for vending castroff garments; for the descendants of Abra- ham seem to have a perverse mania for gilt trum- pery and half-worn wardrobes. There were sev- eral heavy looking chests and boxes about the room, and lumber enough to furnish half a dozen Jewish shops; but all together did not seem to be of the value of a hundred pesos. ' Yet behind all this outward show of mean- ness and poverty,' remarked Don Enrique, ' we shall by-and-by doubtless discover the splendor of untold wealth. Here, sweet lady, thy trou- bles and dangers will end! Here thou wilt find honorable shelter.' ' Yet the hour that secures me ease and free- dom and repose, Enrique, is that in which will open to thee the greatest danger to which thou hast yet been exposed. This conspiracy is fear- ful! 'I can only think of the axe and block as the issue I for what will the small force -the feeble means that your friends can bring to the cause of Cuban libel ty, what are they compared  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7455-00000032"/> with the army of eleven thousand men which are in this city, the splendid regiments com- posing which we caught sight of as we crossed the street leading into the plaza? The martial spectacle of those serried hosts made my heart die away within me. In imagination, I saw a scaffold erected in the centre of that wide plaza, and thee and thy compatriots led up to die!' ' By our good Lady of Palos, dearest, thou art a very coward; once the warm blood of thy haughty and royal ancestors has flashed from thine eyes in beams of courageous light-' ' In danger- danger that menaces only me, I am still worthy of my bold ancestors, Enrique; but it is for thee I speak-for thee I fear! It is my love makes a coward of me!' ' I know it, sweet, and I will for thy sake,so, discreetly act in all this, that no danger shall befall me. See what rewards I have before me! A princely regency and then my queen! --queen of the fairest isle the sun shines upon in his circling voyage around the earth!' ' But E have heard--I have overheard--'  Here Dona Mariana, or as we shall now call her, the Princess Garcilla, checked herself and was silent, and appeared confused. ' What hast thou overheard?' he asked, re- garding her with surprise. ' On that fearful-fearfulnight-' and again she paused and trembled. 'That night's secrets are yet sealed to me, fair Mariana.' ' Thou shalt know them soon-yes-very soon -but,-- 'Nay-I pry not into them. Thou hast my soul's full confidence, sweet.' ' At least I will tell thee what I was about to.  I have overheard-that the Cubans do not think of any other government, if they cast off that of Spain, than republican! That they mean to copy that of the great American States, I and seek admission into their number.' ' That I have heard too, and seemed to assent : to, but it is only the fancy of a small party, the American party. The true liberating chiefs 'of the island seek to establish an independent principality, and the crown will be offered to   "thee and me. Does not thy heart bound-thine eye kindle at the splendor of such an issue!- It were more glorious far to be prince of Cuba than king of Spain, for it is the jewel of her diadem, the glory of her greatness. No, no, Mariana! The true aim of this- revolution is to erect a royal and independent throne here, which throne shall rule over all the islands of these Western Indies, binding them every one to her sceptre in one glittering constellation..-- It is not the star of the empire of Cuba alone, but that of the twenty-one islands, that is to glitter in the diadem which thou wilt wear!' ' I trust thy dazzling dreams, Enrique, will be realized!' she said, without a smile.  'But I have heard that the liberating party is strong and resolute; and it will be that they will- re- gard thee and thy aspirations with as deep hos- tility as they look upon Spain and her tyranny.' ' Time will show which party of the three into which Cuba is to be divided-the royalists, the American, and the Cuban, will have the ascen- dancy. As for me, I and my friends represent the true Cuban party, that will have neither Spain and her power on one hand, nor America and her interference on the other. But our conference must end for the present; for the Jew returns.' ' Dish vay, hombres, dish vay!' said the Is- raelite, as if obeying with great willingness com- mands he had received from a superior. Don Enrique followed him through the shop, and over boxes that seemed to have been left in the way purposely to obstruct the facility of egress from the place, and found himself in an empty room, at the opposite extremity -of which was a narrow door, not a foot in width. Through this the guide edged himself, and Don Enrique had to do so also; but the light form of the- princess passed through without difficulty. The Israelite closed this slip behind him and bolted it carefully. They were now in a long entry, at the end of which was a  flight of stone stairs dimly lighted by a grated window in the wall of the court. 'Arriba, hombres, this is the way!   Mind the broken stairs!" said the man, shuffling up   after them. At the tenth step they landed upon a platform from which were visible three doors, looking in different directions. One of these on the left, covered with cobwebs and mould, the man opened and threw back. Instead of a dark passage like that just passed, Don Enrique be- held before him a broad, noble flight of eight stairs carpeted with crimson and green, and as- cending to a lofty and magnificent salon. He turned and smiled upon the princess at this dis- covery, to witness the effect upon her in corrobo- ration of his words. He was rewarded by her looks of amazement. The man did not mount the stairs, but made a gesture for them to go up. They obeyed and reached the salon. Gorgeous beyond descrip- tion in all its arrangements of furniture, works oT art and gems of luxury, they stood and gazed around upon it with admiration, increased by its heightened contrast with the gloomy apart- ments below leading to the shop. ' Truly a Jew's palace,' remarked Don En- rique. No one was in the room.' A harp upon a dais on one side of the apartment, and a guitar upon a rose-wood tablette, betrayed the residence of a woman, and gave not a little pleasure to the princess. She was about to express her grati- fication when from a side-door Don Baltazar en- tered. He was a tall, imperial looking man, of lofty and commanding stature, such as kingly Saul might have looked. THe was dressed in black throughout, the sable costume relieved only by a starry diamond in the snowy bosom of his shirt, and lawn ruffles at the wrists. His hair was turning gray and worn back from his temples, displaying a noble forehead and a manly beauty of feature that can only be found, when found at all, in the descendants-of the oriental patriarchs. There was an air of grace and dignity about him that was exceedingly impressive; and his urbane smile at once won the confidence of Dona Mariana. He held in one hand an open note, in the other a silver signet. ' Did you bring this signet?' he asked, fixing his eyes upon DonEnrique, and Adressing   him courteously, yet as if he believed he was ' speaking only to a common sailor. ' Is he safe? Has he reached the city?' ' Yes, Don Baltazar.' 'Where is-' but he paused and glanced. at the disguised Dona Mariana, as if he did not know whether he should speak in the presence of this third person. ' Are we alone, senor?' asked Don Enrique. ' Quite, my good man! Speak freely, if he is also to be trusted?' ' Then in me, Don Baltazar, you behold not a messenger from,. but Don Enrique de Espana!' ' Thou de Espana?' exclaimed the noble Is- raelite, with incredulous surprise. 'Yes, Don Baltazar. I have been forced to assume this disguise in which you see me, in or- der to escape my enemies!' ' WelCome then, noble caballero! This is a happy day! Thou hast been some days ex- pected! I embrace thee in the name of all my compatriots. How hast thou escaped the vigi- lance of the police, and the argus eyes of the government.  Three days ago, a Spanish frigate came into port reporting thy escape from Spain, and having chased thy vessel even to the very Cape de Piedras, where they lost sight of her in a fog.  Thrice and again, we welcome thee, and rejoice in thy safety.' And Don Baltazar em- -braced the young Spanish noble with great warmth, and then, as if to atone for this for- mality, he respectfully kissed his hand. ' Here are papers from our friends in Spain, Senor Baltazar. Read them whilst I change my costume, and remove some of these stains of tar from my face and hands.' ' Father Abraham! but thou art well con- cealed under thy disguise. And let me advise thee to keep it by thee, lest thou shouldst have need of it again; for the whole city is on the alert to arrest thee! I am at a loss to know how you could have reached here?' ' I will tell thee my adventures, by-and-by, senor.' Don Baltazar here glanced once more atDona Mariana, as if he were puzzled to decide wheth- er or no there was not another person than the  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7455-00000033"/> dirty sailor lad before him, concealed under the torn jacket, tarred trowsers and smutted cheeks. She cast her eyes down beneath his gaze. I have not asked thee where thou hast left the princess, but I trust in safety, unless--but no- that is impossible! She is not here!' ' Thou hast divined justly, Senor Baltazar.' 'What-this the Princess Garcilla?' he ex-, claimed with mingled amazement and respect. ' No one else. Our safety, senor, required these disguises, as thou shalt by-and-by learn.' ' No doubt, no doubt, and I am glad they have saved thee. Permit me, gracious lady, to-but I can hardly recognize in thee, enough of the lady to make my knee do homage to thee,' he said, smiling; 'it seems I kneel to a sailor boy V' 'Reserve thine homage, noble Baltazar, then,' answered she, in the sweetest tones in the world, 'until I appear in a character more beseeming.' ' Nay, then, I will kneel to thee, for thy voice proclaims thee what thou art.' And the dig- nified Jew bent on one knee before her, and pressed his lips to the small hand, though for the stains of tar upon it, he knew scarcery, where to place his lips. 'This is indeed a happy hour, my noble friends. But this is no time to talk. You must both need retirement, baths and toilet. For thee, Senor Don Enrique, I will myself be thy conductor to a room where thou wilt at once throw off this dress and assume a robe de cham- bre. I will then send my slaves to thee; but I cannot trust them  so far, while there is so much activity to discover thee, as to let them see 'thee or know that thou hast entered my dwelling in such guise. They must not know, when they see thee, that thou wert one of the seamen who must have been seen coming into my  shop!  And for thee, lady,' he added,  I have a fair daughter who can be trusted, and who will go wild with joy when she shall hear who she is to entertain as her guest. She is now at the synagogue. Here is the door of her apartment.  Enter and drop there thy disguise, and supply it with some of her robes thou wilt find there. I will then send he'tlave to do thy   , biddings. When next we meet, I shall do hom- age to the princess under her true colors!' With these words Don Baltazar advanced to , the door of his daughter's boudoir, and threw it * open. The interior, of which a glimpse was ob- tained as Dona Mariana hastened through the door with a glad bound, as if she sought to hide  herself from anothermoment's observation in her male attire, was gorgeous and voluptuous be- yond the dream of an Oriental. When she disappeared, Don Enrique gave utterance to a sigh of relief, as if a heavy res- ponsibility-a  burdensome fear, had been re- moved from his heart. ' Thank God, Don Baltazar, that I at last see her under your roof in honorable and secure shelter, and about to assume the dress becoming her sex and rank.  She has endured, for one so delicately reared, hardships and privations that few could have gone through.  But a few'days' rest will no doubt make her herself again.' ' And the society of my daughter Rebecca will soon make her feel at home here. Come with me now, noble Don Enrique.  I will show thee where thou canst cast this vile skin of tar and canvass. Thou hast well arrived on this day; to-night our friends meet here- in council!' I Then my  coming is well-timed, Don Balta. zar,' answered the young noble, as he followed the rich Israelite from the salon through a door of mahogany, bordered with bead-work of bur- nished gold, and surmounted by a wreath of oak leaves intertwining a  crown. Passing through this, he ushered his guest into an inner room, which bore all the features of luxury and opu- lence that characterized the rooms already seen. ' Here is thy chamber,' said he. 'I will now leave thee to refresh thyself. In a quarter of an hour a slave shall be at thy bidding!' ' Your hospitality is princely, noble Baltazar,' answered Dorf Enrique. ' We dine at four!' said Don Baltazar, ' when thou art refreshed, and would see me to talk over the business of thy mission, send for me. Thou wilt remember that to-night our friends meet.' ' I will prepare myself for the council,' an- swered Don Enrique, as the Israelite left him.   CHAPTER X. ' Our councils smell of war and treason to the state I' gg1E   will for the present leave Dona Mariana and Don Enrique to their respective toilets, and the luxurious baths of scented waters which the rich Jew had ordered for each, and take the reader to the cathedral, a noble, old Spanish-Morisco edifice,. in the bosom of the city. A youthful stranger enters it at the time we are approaching it. He is evidently a protestant, for he did not dip his finger in the marble font of holy water at the side of the door and cross himself therewith devotedly as others did,- on entering; nor did he kneel before the high altar which brought every other knee to the marble pavement in reverence. He walked or rather sauntered slowly up the nave of the vast church, stepping in respectful silence but without superstitious homage. The hour of mass closed as he entered, and from  the great central door, the worshippers passed forth into the sun-bright day to remingle with the noisy and active world. The stranger, however, undisturbed by the departure of the devotees, stood gazing upon a form that remain-  ed unmoved before a shrine of a Madonna, in an obscure angle of the cathedral, where at no hour a of the day was there more than a twilight dis- tinctness. One after another rose from their a 'devotions and passed out; but this kneeling i figure remained immoveable and the personifica-  tion of grace. Impressed with awe and curiosity, he advanc- e 'ed a few steps; the -nearer he drew the more c he doubted whether it were a figure of stain- i less marble, a wonder of sculpture, or a wor- shipper possessing a grace and glory of form d that would mock the chisel of art.     a The youthful stranger, with his sombrero in o his hand, after gazing a moment or two in lon- ger indecision upon the kneeling figure, advanc- . ed slowly until he stood within three paces of her. Bending in an attitude of grace illimita- a ble before the steps of the throne of the image, a she remained no longer motionless.  He could 6               I   see that the veil which covered her from her brow to her feet heaved lightly with the gentle undulations of a woman's heart beneath it. ' She is not marble then, but flesh and blood,' a he said, to himself. ' What beauty that must r defy the skill of the most ambitious painter must of this envious veil conceal! She is a woman, a young and graceful as a Venus robed and kneel- , ing. I will see her face-for'I shall have no e peace till I know who has all at once stolen my s heart! There is but one form on earth that a could match this-but-' H Here :his reflections were interrupted by a t voice that came from the kneeling grace. She I spoke as-if so wholly absorbed in her devotions ^ she did not know that she was not alone with r the ear and eye of Heaven. He listened with surprise, joy, amazement and rapture, by turns,  as she gave utterance to earnest petitions for un- I believing, down-trodden Israel. After thus pouring forth her fervent prayer, Ishe paused  in deep emotion, and then, rising, she  kissed the jewelled hand of the virgin mother, and turned to leave the shrine. As she did so, she discerned the tall and manly figure of the stranger.  She started, half stepped aside, and drawing her veil about her face, crossed to quit the cathedral by one of the side doors. 'Senora,' said the  stranger, advancing to overtake her, and speaking in a voice tremulous with emotion, and the eagerness of which was only repressed by a fear of alarming her. She stopped, and seemed to gaze at the speak- er through her veil. They were in the transept of the church, where a rich beam of light poured in from rose-tinted panes. ' Senora Rebecca!' he repeated, in tones of deep feeling and tenderness. ' It can be no other than  you!  Your voice betrays you-no other accents could so move my soul!' 'Theodore!' she   exclaimed, throwing her veil aside, as if to be sure to whom she spoke. ' It is Rebecca!' he exclaimed, on beholding a  beautiful face, the dark, oriental orbs of whiah were fixed upon him with joyful recognition. 'Theodore I can it be possible 1' she said  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7455-00000034"/> with feeling, at the depth of which was evident- I ly the profoundest joy.           1 'This is indeed happiness!' he said. ' When  did you leave Spain? How is it I find you in c Havana, senora, when I believed thee in ; Spain?' ' And how do I see you here, Theodore?' she asked, with a smile of happiness lighting up 1 her glorious eye.       ,  'I will tell you, sweet lady, when I hear thy : history,-one kiss!' 'Nay-do not think of it here! This place is sacred!' she said, withdrawing her hand. ' And so is love!' he answered warmly. ' What on earth can be purer than my love for thee. It has never ceased since last I beheld thee-but rather increased with absence and despair. It seems to me, dearest senora, that I must dream! That instead of beholding thee in person, I am mocked into a delusion, and ,shall see thee ascend one of these altars and take again thy place as a Madonna, to be wor- shipped by the adoring world!' ( This is too strong language, Theodore. We must not hold discourse, if such is to be thy style of speech, in this holy house I' ' But where, then, shall I meet thee, Rebec- ca? Where dost thou dwell?' ' My father has for three years been a resi- dent of this city.' ' I will then see thee to thy abode, and- ' Nay, not now!' she answered, embarrassed. ' Is it safe for thee to be seen here?' she asked earnestly. 'Why not, dearest Rebecca!' ' Thou art an American-an American naval officer, and your countrymen here are suspected and feared by the government.' The young man smiled proudly. They had now, as they slowly walked on, reached the broad dark curtain that separated the interior from the open door of the street. She stopped, and turning, bowed her head reverently before the high altar, with a grace of manner that was native to her superb form, every motion of which was poetry, as every tone of her voice was a sort of throat-like Garble, like the nightingale's.   She then dipped her ungloved finger in the mar- ble font of consecrated water, and made the sign of the cross upon her bosom. The young offi- cer stood observing with evident surprise and anxiety. ' If I was amazed to discover in the fair wor- shipper at the shrine of the blessed Mary the beautiful Jewess Rebecca, I am still more amazed to see thee go through all the minor forms of Christian worship! It is a riddle to me, senora, how I find thee in such a place as this cathedral at all!' ' I am a Christian, Theodore!' she answered, with a holy awe subduing her tones, while a light of elevated faith beamed amid the starry splendor of her eyes, as she looked earnestly in his. ' Then I am the happiest man in Cuba. Now that thou art a Christian, Rebecca, I can safely love thee, for there will now be no obstacle to our-- ' Hush, Theodore! Do not speak of that now!' 'No time more fitting, for I may not soon have the opportunity. In the midnight watch, on the lonely ocean, I have thought of thee and said in my heart, and even uttered aloud to the listening zephyrs, if thou hadst been a Chris- tian I would never have left Spain without' win- ning thy hand, as I believed-is it true, sweet, that I had won thy heart? The remembrance of thee has-made me insensible to the arrowy shafts of beauties of many lands, and indiffer- ent to their charms. Wilt thou believe it, Re- becca, when I entered this cathedral to while away an idle hour, I was thinking of thee- thinking how I first saw thee, when I was com- ing out of a cathedral in Cadiz, as thou wert walking past. Then my eyes saw thee, but to fall in love with thee at sight. When- I :was told thou wert a Jewess, the daughter of the opulent Cuban Jew, who dwelt half his time in Spain and half his time in the West Indies, my iheart received a deep wound, and I sighed to i think I should never possess thee! But when i afterwards I saw thee at thy balcony, as I 'was  riding out, I purposely made my horse throw   me almost at thy feet, in order that I might have an opportunity of speaking to thee.' ' Then you were thrown purposely, senor?' she said, with an arch smile. ' You never told me that before i ' Yet it is true. Of course you were more alarmed than I was harmed; and your expres. sions of sympathy, your ready offers of your hospitable house, my thanks and gratitude, all together, broke the ice and made us friends. If thou hadst not been a Jewess, dear angel, I should have-- ' Done something very foolish, I 'have no doubt,' she said, smiling. 'Yet I am  still a Jewess, Theodore!' 'Yes, no-you   are a Christian,-such a Jewess indeed as were Mary and Martha. I know not how to express my joy at this change I find in you. What good star brought it about?' ' It cannot be told thee now-perhaps I shall never tell thee, Theodore.' ' Say only thou lovest me, then!' 'I am   too happy to say o! The certainty that, in meeting thee, now so unlooked for, I find thee the same, is a source of 'pure happi- ness to me I' 'This is enough, sweet Rebecca! From this hour- are we not one and inseparable? Like Isaac when he loved Rebecca, I swear to thee eternal fidelity!' 'Now tell me, I beseech thee,' she said, after she had suffered him to draw her to his heart and press the kiss of holy betrothalupon her lips and brow, 'tell. me how it is I find thee in Havana, which thy countrymen just now should shun, when the spies of the government are watching the footsteps of all who come from thy shores? -;Art thou just arrived, and is it possi- ble that thou art ignorant of this state of things?' 'No, love  !. I have been here two w6eks. You see I  am not inanhy uniform of an Ameri- can officer. I  am disguised as a Cuban gen- tleman, and pass for such.' 'Not with thy pure Saxon blue eye and fair northern tint of complexion, Theodore. But twhy this-disguise?  Is it that you are also one of the-of the-'   t  The proposed army now organizing in the' land of patriots, dost thou mean-?' 'To invade this island and lift the standard 1 of liberty to its degraded people?' ' Wouldst thou not hate me, if I were one of those who sought to overthrow the government * of the island?' 'No,' she answered, with resolute enthusi. asm. ' It is time Cuba, degenerate, enslaved Cuba, were free I I love thy country, Theo. dore! Thou didst teach me to love it, and to honor the names of Washington, Warren, Knox, Jackson, and its host of patriotic warriors!' ' By the beard of Pope JoanI thou art as stout a liberatora as any of us, Rebecca!' I am glad to find thee in this complexion of poli- ties. I will now confide in thee. I am one of the proposed invaders. I am here as 'a spy!' A spy I' she repeated, clasping her hand with terror. 'Nay, do not be alarmed. No one suspects me. .I have nearly completed my mission, and to-morrow I intended to leave for New Orleans, to report. But now I have found thee, I shall remain.'            f ' Not a day I not an hour! JThy life will be the forfeit! Besides, thy duty done here, honor calls thee to go away and make known what thou hast discovered of advantage!' ' True, noble Rebecca! But how can I leave thee?' 'Thou wilt the sooner return I Now thou canst see me only by stealth. Come back and claim me as a conqueror, and thou shalt crown thyself with me as one of thy laurels.' '   You speak like a heroine! So must Judith have looked and spoke when she said she would go forth to destroy the tyrant of her land. I have caught the unselfish nature of thy, better spirit, Rebecca. -Suffer me to see thee to-night to say farewell, and before morning dawn I shall see Cuba but as a blue line on the, receding horizon-not to behold it again till I return with the invading army of heroes I' ' I promise the interview, for I have much to tell thee of importance.' ' How is it thou art so familiar with our con- templated expedition?'  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7455-00000035"/> ' It is well known. But I see that thou art i ignorant of what thou shouldst know. Come t to the third window of the second house on -- 1 street when the- moon rises. Thou wilt know the window by a blue lamp thou wiltesee bum- 1 ing faintly in it. Be cautious, for my father is ] not of thy party.' ' Is he a royalist, then 2' 'No.'  ' Pray, then, would he have Cuba remain as i it is, in slavery to a tyrant ' ' No, senor. This evening thou shajt know. Now one question!' ' Three, if thou wilt, sweet Rebecca,.' 'What work will be thine in this expected descent upon the island? Thou art not a mili- tary man 2' ' I am, all a seaman, Rebecca. I have re- signed my position in the navy, to unite myself with this expedition of the liberating army. I love liberty. I detest kings. I wish, like every true American, to see all people free. I feel it a sacred duty to aid every nation to break its chains. I am willing to shed my blood to con- vert the sceptres of kings into the liberty-poles of freemen I I have entered this cause with the highest and purest motives. Your countrymen of Cuba came to our land and told us how the best hearts in the island, how the brave men and fair women, the poor and the crushed, the war- rior and the man of trade, all desired to be free. They detailed the wrongs of the island, and our souls were fired with a desire te redress them. The chivalry of the American bosom was en- kindled, and a thousand blades are now un- sheathed, ready to strike for ' Cuba and Liber- ty 1' The position I shall occupy will be to take command of the first frigate we shall be so fortunate as to capture; for one of our first steps will be to possess ourselves of some of the ships of war. My commission is that of an ad- miral, Rebecca,' he added with a smile; 'but it will soon be something more than an empty and prospective title.' -I do not doubt it, Theodore. If anything could add to my joy at seeing you, it is to rec- ognize in you one of those heroic .liberators, the   very idea of whose coming makes our tyrant tremble, and our patriotic countrymen's hearts bound with hope!'             I 'There is too much fear, too much dread of the captain-general and his army, among the, people, I find ;' said Theodore, with a slightly derisive curl of his fine lip. ' Much as they de- sire freedom, they want us to purchase it our- selves and give it to them! There are hun- dreds who will not lift a finger to co-operate with us until the victory is complete!' 'This is from, the habit of long submission and want of practice in war, senor.  You Americans are warriors by birth! Your cradle of liberty was rocked amid the roar of battling armies; and your conquering hosts marth from battle-field to battle-field, like a traveller, day by day, on his journey from inn to inn.' At this moment, the curtain within which they stood was lifted, and a youthful figure veiled in deep sable, entered. She was slightof form, with a step light as an antelope's, and a carriage of the head finely spirited. Theodore gazed af- ter her with a look of admiration, as he said: ' How various is female beauty. There is a perfect form, step, air, and, I dare say face; yet it is wholly unlike thine own, and thou art beautiful also-beautiful beyond the expression of words!' ' I see thou hast an errant eye, Senor Theo- dore.' ' Nay, 'tis thy beauty maketh me to delight in all beauty. But wilt thou hasten from me?' - he added, as he saw her getting her mantilla about her head and preparing to leave the ves- - tibule. D  ' It is time, Theodore! D  ' I will then see thee at thy balcony--at what it hour.' e  Dost thou forget so soon?' - ' Ay-I' now remember--at moon-rising. t The splendor of thy eyes makes me forget sun, y moon, and stars.' 'I see thou hast not forgotten flattery, Senor g Theodore;' she said, smiling and giving him :- her hand, which he pressed to his heart. lhe e next moment she was out of the door and mo-   ving onward along the shadow of the lofty walls of the cathedral. The side door of the church, by which he stood, was retired, and few persons passed it; and none entered the door while he was there. Near it was standing a female slave who seemed to be waiting for the lady who had gone in a quarter of an hour before; as. she held a broad sunshade in her hand, and a mantilla. The eyes of the young man happened to rest on her. ' Come hither,' he said, in Spanish. ' Who is thy mistress?' The woman shook her head, and opening her mouth, pointed down her throat, which was with- out a palate, uttered uncouth sounds, like- 'Ugh-wh-lllugh-gughlll.' ' Very intelligible,' remarked Theodore. ' There is some reason, I dare say, everything is so mysterious among these Spaniards, for this beautiful girl who went in here, being attended by a mute. I will see who she is, as I have full leisure till moon-rise, which (and here he glanced at the sun over his head) is many hours off.' In a few minutes the female re-appeared. The slave followed her close behind, and T+heo- dore kept both in sight. He had never wit- nessed, he thought, so beautiful a step as that. of the graceful devotee. After going two squares the lady entered a large gate-way that led into a court, paved with marble, and adorned with orange-trees and vast vases filled with fragrant plants. ' Who dwells in that magnificent, mansion?' he asked of a fruit-seller near. ' Don Baltazar, the -rich Jew,' answered the man. ' Don Baltazar! Then what lady was that who just entered? canst tell me?' 'No, senor, unless it was his fair daughter.' ' It was not she,' murmured Theodore, as he looked at the high walls that enclosed the gar- den. ' Who, then, eat it be? It is not possi- ble that she can reside there, for plainly Senora Rebecca did not recognize her when she passed us and entered the'church. Now I have found the house, I will see where the window is-and balcony. It is not on this side. I must then look for it on the next street.'   The young American then walked around the angle of the high and strong wall, and found that the mansion of theJew extended along another streetfor several hundred feet. Near the lower comer he saw the window which Re- becca had described. Having taken particular notice of its bearing, he looked and looked in vain for a sight of, the beautiful Jewess. There- at, he walked on, and, turning another corner, came round to the rear of the dwelling. As he went on he came to the public square in which four regiments of infantry, one of ar- tillery, and one of horse, were being reviewed by the captain-9gneral and his brilliant staff. He stood apart and looked at the martial spec- tacle. Twice the general, mounted on a large coal-black horse, which was covered with gold and housings, rode close past him. He was a noble, Spanish-looking man, with a military air, but an imperative eye and mouth. Twenty or more officers, some of them with heads as white as snow, men who had fought against Napoleon, and jothers, mere stripling scions of Castile's best houses, rode around him. ' And there are eleven thousand such men to be conquered by us before the liberating army. can obtain the confidence of the timid Cubans,' said the young American, as he witnessed this display. 'Well, we wont count heads. Cour- age!  What we have done in Mexico, we can do here. Let Spain send all her armies hither- Cuba must fall I 'There is the man!' said a stern voice, in Spanish, near him, at his side. Before he could look round, he found himself in the grasp of three soldiers, and three others presented their bayonets at his breast I' CHAPTER XI. (Thy tale hath marvels like the paladins.' V W  HAT   means this arrest?' demand- ed the young American, with ,lr prise, and haughty defiance.     ' Thou shalt know  at a proper time, senor,' answered the officer, in a quiet tone. ' Con- duct him, -but without violence, to the palace.'  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7455-00000036"/> Theodore found that resistance to such num- i bers would be madness; and, suspecting the true cause of his arrest, though wondering by i whom he had been betrayed, he submitted to his destiny. "ead on, then!' he answered, in Spanish, as pure as the noblest Castilian could speak. ' Thou must have good cause, senores, for ar- resting a subject of the king of Spain in this violent way.' The officer made no reply, though he looked at him with harder and closer scrutiny. The men led him forward, strongly guarded, in the direction of the governor's palace, where arriving, at a word from the officer, a sergeant appear- ed from a guard-house within the gate, and the party were admitted into a paved pateo, sur- rounded on two sides by lofty walls, and on the, other two by buildings. Towards one of these, across an area in which lounged several soldiers, smoking, or cleaning their accoutrements, he was led by his captors and conducted to a door in a sort of prison; for the three windows which looked out upon the court were narrow and closely grated. A sentry was at the door. - By command of the officer in charge of Theodore, the soldier inserted a key into the lock and threw wide open the door. It opened into a stone apartment, containing no .other furniture than two oaken benches and a table. ' Here, senor, you will please remain till the governor's pleasure is known;' said the officer, with courtesy, but firmness. Theodore was then released; the men return- ed and left him alone in the strong room  in which they had placed hitm. For a few moments. he stood, as if unable to realize the-abrupt and dream-like change in his circumstances. At length he began to examine his apartment, and was soon satisfied that the place was too strong for him to hope to escape from it. He could still hear the crash of instrumental music from the Plaza, and the shouts of the peo- ple, at witnessing some more splendid manoeuvre of the horse or artillery than before. ' It has come to this, at last,' he said, trying to put as calm a face upon a matter so disagree-   able, as he could. ' It is plain I have been be. trayed. They could not have penetrated my disguise. Well, it is the fortune of war! I shall, at least, be liberated by the liberating army in a few days. But, dear Rebecca! I am de- nied the pleasure of the interview with thee, to- night. Alas! the blue light will burn bluer ere thou seest me, and thy eyes will be dim with watching. What can the captain-general want with me! If he has arrested me as aspy, and can prove its I shall be shot! But it will be sufficient for him to prove it! At any rate, my situation is' critical enough. My first act stall be to acquaint Rebecca with it. Woman's wit against all the world to help a man in extremity.' He then approached a grating in the door, and called to one of the Spanish soldiers, for there were three who stood sentry without, as if one had been placed as spy over another. ' Hola I  senor caballero! Baen soldado! Hist!' ' I am forbid speaking with thee, senor!' an- swered the man. ' Canst thou see!' Use thine eyes if thou art not forbidden ;' and Theodore held up to his vision eight'broad pieces of gold-yellow Span- ish onzas. The man smiled, and then glancing, round at his companions, shook his head. Theodore un- derstood from this that he could be bought if he could sell himself without danger. So he drew from his pooket-book a piece of paper and wrote on it as follows: ' SWEET JEWESS: ' I am under arrest, and in the lock- up of the palace. And what I am here for. I know not, as my  captors were silent as quakers. It strikes me that they have arrested me rather: as a Spaniard than an American, for they did not act as if they knew me to be the latter. It is my impression I  am arrested under an error for somebody else; as, if they had taken me as a  spy, I would have been sent to the Moro Cas- tle. At all events, it may be- found out who I am, and then it will be shortwork with me. If you think you can aid me, I  need not say that' I  shall feel very grateful for the smallest favors. I have implicit faith in a loving woman's wit.   I have thought it best to notify you of my de- tention, lest, not seeing me to-night, you should think me recreant, and forgetful of thee. ' Your faithful friend, THEODORE.' The young officer, having written with pencil this brief despatch, folded it, and placed up- on it the eight ounces. He then approached the grate, and when the other soldiers were look- ing away, he held both up in sight of -the san- try. The man's eyes responded intelligently; and after a few minutes, during which he seem- ed to be thinking closely, he took his canteen, which was a wooden cup, and called to one of the soldiers to fill it with water for the prisoner. When it was brought he handed it in through the grate, and winked at the captive. Theodore drank, and then placed the paper and gold in the bottom of the emptied vessel. The sentinel received it, and as he did so, Theodore held up his purse, and said in an under tone, 'if to that note an answer is brought, thou shalt have four more onzas!' The:nman's eyes expressed his content, and Theodore saw him replace his canteen, note, golden onzas and all in his belt again, and once more resume his measured pace, as serious and fierce as if he were the most trusty sentry that ever shouldered musket. In one hour's time he was relieved, and Theo- dore saw him go off duty, and shortly afterwards without arms, cross the court and disappear be- yond the outer gate. ' That note will be safely delivered,' he said, his fine eyes sparkling with hope; and if it re- sult in no more, she will, at least, learn why I shall not be at my appointment, to-night; but I have such faith in her devotion, that I believe she will succeed in getting my release. But, if not, I must meet my fate-a brave man's it shall be, whatever it be!' He then began to walk up and down his prison, speculating upon the probable true cause of his arrest, and his con- finement in the palace look-up, insteadlof in the Ioro or the Calaboso. We will now return to Dona Mariana. After she had bathed, and exchanged her male attire,   for one of the elegant robes belonging to Re- becca, the daughter of her host, and having sufficiently admired herself once more in the appropriate costume of her sex, her first emo- tions were of gratitude. She fell on her knees and offered uip thanks to Heaven, for her tpres- ervation through so many and great dangers, and for her present shelter. But, being a true Roman Catholic, she had been taught to pray to visible representations; and as the room con- tained neither crucifix nor cross, madonna nor shrine of saint, she felt a strong desire to go at once to the neartest temple of God, and there make her Ypws, and offdr thanksgivings before his altars. She therefore inquired of the fe- male -slave, whom Don Baltazar. had sent to obey her commands, the way to it; and guided by her, she made her way, closely veiled, to the sanctuary. We have seen her enter the door of the ca- thedral, and return, followed by the curiosity of the youthful American, and re-enter Don Balta- zar's abode.  Dona Rebecca had, however, reached her father's house, first; and meeting her father in the hall, he told her of a fair stranger he had invited to his house. ' Her name, father?' ' The princess! Couldst thou not divine?' 'What, my (noble sir, dost thou mean to say that the Princess-de Campobello has arrived from Spain!' ' Hush! Not so loud, child!  Walls listen, and whisper what they hear, to the winds! It must not be known!' ' She would be sacrificed! Placards are call- ing for her arrest, and that of Don Enrique de Espana!' ' And he is here,-also!'. '.The prince, himself!' ' No less, dear child,' answered the Israelite. ' And in this housb!' 'In yonder room!   Come hitherI  Let me present thee.' ' Not now, dear father, not now!' ' I will to my own room,' she answered, sad and troubied; for she had too much  generosity to seem to, be  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7455-00000037"/> a friend to the prince and his cause, when her interests and hopes were all on the opposite side. She was perplexed, and knew not how she should shape her conduct It is true, she knew they were expected. She knew that her father and the ' imperial party,' as those called themselves who were hoping to establish an empire of the Western Ind, intended to offer him and the prin- cess the crown of the island realms.  She knew all the schemes, plans, hopes and views of this party of which her father was no mean leader; for he had confided to her all his secrets, never suspecting that she could have any other predilections than his own. But thefore she heard of the imperialists' ambitious views, she was arepublican! Her intimacy with Theodore, in Spain, had made her thoroughly American in feeling and sentiment; for wherever the Ameri- can goes, there he bears the germ of civil free- dom, and sows the seed of liberty, broadcast in his-path. The first breath, therefore, of liber- ty, breathed in the island, had found in her a warm advocate; she had fanned the spark when- ever she could, into flame, and nourished the flame with her prayers. Whenever she heard Cubans speaking of liberty her heart bounded with them; and ere there wasgany proper or- ganization of parties she was, in the-secret of her soul, a thorough independante.  When, therefore, she was one day made the confidante by her father, of a scheme for placing the Prince Enrique de Espana on the throne of an empire of the Isles, she listened with surprise,. fear and unwillingness. She did not betray her opposi- tion save by sealed silence, and this he took for full approval, and ever after regarded her as one of the safest keepers of the secret of the conspiracy. She would have undeceived him; but she had a secret still deeper, that she was trying to conceal from him, and which she fear- ed he would discover every hour; this was her conversion to the faith of the cross. She adopt- ed, therefore, the policy of listening to her fath- er's dangerous revelations, without expressing either assent or dissent; and thus became the repository of secrets of the highest importance. When, therefore, she now learned the arrival   of the two distinguished persons, on whom the hopes of the conspirators terminated, she was not a little troubled how to comport herself. If she had not been closely veiled, her father must have discovered her confusion. She was about to leave him and hasten to her apartment, when the door of the saloon opened, and Don Enrique entered. He was now attired as became a Spanish gentleman, in a suit of black, which finely set off the noble proportions of his manly figure. Upon seeing the father and daughter in conversation, he would have drawn back, but Don Baltazar called to him: ' Nay, come forward, your highness; this is my daughter, Rebecca. We were just speaking of you.' The maiden regarded the handsome stranger with looks of admiration, for she had never be. held a man more lordly in his aspect, or more chivalrous in his bearing, save Theodore, to whom she thought he bore a striking resemblance; and hence, the fixed gaze which she placed up- on him. She -removed her veil, bowed low be- fore the prince, and coldly said, hardly knowing what to say: 'I am glad, my lord prince, that you have escaped the dangers of the sea.' ' You give him cold welcome, girl! But, my prince, she will meet the princess with warmth enough to make it up. She is now in your room, Rebecca, awaiting thee.', The maiden, scarcely looking a second time towards Don Enrique, slightly bowed, as she answered: ' I will go and welcome her!' ' And give her a more hearty one than thou hast given the prince, Rebecca,' said her father, going after her a few steps, and speaking in her ear. ' One would swear you were sorry they had come!' ' Did I lookso? I did not intend to look so, dear father!'    l, ' I know it well. I know it well, and so then don't appear so. Kiss the hand of the princess when thou seest her; and extend to her all hos- pitality. And let me warn thee to call her princess, and Don Enrique prince, only in pri-   vate, lest 'other ears hear. A reward is set up- on their heads, and they must be well guarded against the dangers that menace them. -By some means it has got out that they are ar- rived, and it would seem, it is known, for what purpose too. Here they must remain, private and unknown, save to us. I therefore shall myself hold the keys of all the entrances to my mansion, and no one enters or goes out, save I act as porter! I was just going when you en- tered, to take the keys.' Rebecca made no reply; and finding her father said no more, she left him and entered her boudoir, closing the door. ' You must not heed-- her manner, my lord prince,' he said, to Don Enrique. ' Her manner is all grace, and her face beau- tiful, beyond description! She has impressed me well, Don Baltazar. By the mass! Thou shouldst be proud of having so stately and fair a daughter!' 'She is good and obedient, my prince, and that is enough. She is a true friend to the \ am  glad of it! Hast thou seen Dona Mariana since she has assumed her female attire?' 'No, noble Don Enrique. Just now, a ser- vant came to me and told me ,she had gone forth to the cathedral, to offer prayers for her safety.' ' Gone to the cathedral!' She did not go alone. A female slave ac- companied her.' ' This was imprudent.' 'Then she went, and I knew it not. She will soon return. I will then -keep, as I told thee, the keys of my gates, that none enter or go out, save under my own eye. Had I been at the gate, I should have shown her highness the danger she would encounter by the exposure!' 'I am surprised at her courage-not to call it imprudence. I hope she went closely veiled.' 'So the servant said, myprince. Ah, here they return!' The porter at this moment let in the veiled lady whom Theodore had seen, and Don En- rique hastened down the steps of the corridor to meet her as she crossed the court.   ' I am relieved of a mountain's weight, Ma- riana, by seeing thee again!' he said. 'You have run a great risk!' ' I could not withhold my gratitude to Heav- en, Enrique. I knew angels would protect me to and fro on such a mission.' ' Thank the angels, then, thou art safely back again! How well thou'lookest in thy fair ap- parel, save that thy cheek is a little browned, and that thou earriest thy head a little more gal- lantly, like a young man 1' Dona Mariana blushed, and smiling, said: ' I beg you will not remember "Garcilaso " any more, Enrique.' ' I will gladly forget him, since I have the Princess Mariana to take his place. Thou hast run great risks.  Hereafter, go not abroad without me.'          .  ' I promise it. I have paid my first duty to God, and now I owe the next to thee, Enrique. But wilt thou also remain in?   A lady can veil and go abroad in safety. But a man's brow must be open to the gaze of every eye I' ' I will not expose myself unnecessarily, be assured, fair Mariana. Hast thou yet seen the lovely daughter of Don Baltazar?' ' Not yet-but-'         *. ' I have just spoken with her. She htgone to her boudoir, where she waits for thee Vl,';iShe' is something haughty, methinks, but thoU iWilt like her! A little reserve in a beautiful Woinan, and She a Jewess, is not amiss.' After a few moments' further conversation, which assumed a tenderer tone than we choose to unfold to the reader's eye, they separated, the princess to enter the apartments assigned to her; and Don Enrique to seek the presence of Don Baltazar, with whom he had to discuss mat- ters of great importance. The result of the interview between them, was, that a little while after noon, the Israelite left his house, and locking fast his gate and put- ting the key into his pocket, went to visit sev- eral of his friends of the ' imperial' party, whom be   invited to meet him at his house at dark. , When   the princess re-entered the boudoir,  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7455-00000038"/> she beheld the fair Jewess seated upon an otto. man, and buried in deep thought. Upon hear- ing her come in, Dona Rebecca arose and ad- vanced to meet her with a smile of welcome.- The two maidens eyed one another with mutual curiosity as they approached each other, as if each would in the glance read the secret of the other's character. Rebecca was prepossessed at once in her favor; but the princess did not feel that going forth of confidence which she expect- ed she should have experienced for the daughter of her host. For the cloud of the secret which was in the possession of Rebecca, shaded the light of her eyes. It was impossible for her to assume a frankness and cordiality which she could not feel. The first meeting over, the two ladies entered into conversation on various subjects. On the part of the princesoswho did not doubt that the fair Jewess was her true friend, it was free and unconstrained; but on the part of Rebecca, em- barrassed and absent. The grace, beauty, and sensible character of Dona Mariana won so much upon her, that she was half inclined to wish her success in the great political scheme which' had for its aim placing her upon a throne. But her principles of liberty came to her aid, and while she could not but love, the maiden, she had no sympathy for the princess. In the meanwhile, Don Enrique was engaged in looking over papers which Don Baltazar had left with him to examine. During the day, the noble Spaniard had more than one interview with individuals who came secretly, and under disguise, to the house, and went away as they came. ' Is it probable, dear Dona Rebecca, that the meeting to-night will be composed of the princi- pal chiefs V' asked Dona Mariana of the Jewess, as just before the sun went down, they walked together upon a balcony that commanded a view of the governor's palace and a portion of the trees of the Alameda, with a green undulating line of the country seen over the walls. 4 The chiefs will no doubt be here, lady,' an- swered Rebecca, who was thinking only of her 'ohief,' Theodore.   ' This is a painful crisis to me! I tremble at the contemplation of what events may trans- pire before all is achieved!' ' Why, then, lady, do you embark in so peril- ous an enterprise. It would be a terrible thing for thy fair head to fall on the scaffold!' The princess slightly shuddered; and then said with resolution and courage: I fear not for myself. Death can do no harm to one who looks to the bright home in the skies, which we can only reach through the grave. But I fear for Don Enrique!' ' It is his ambition, then, rather than thine, lady, which seeks to place a crown upon thy head?' ' For his sake I would do and dare all things. To see him a crowned emperor, I would sacrifice my life.' ' Yet, on thy life depends his expected crown. Is he not thy husband, lady? I think I heard my father say that you were to be married se- cretly in Madrid!' ' Not yet-not yet! .We are first cousins, as thou knowest-and our marriage is to take place only in the event of success in this revolutions and then, publicly, at our coronation. We would have been married sooner, but Don.)En- rique and I took a holy vow that we would not marry until the throne of Cuba was won.' ' And if it were never won?' 'Then we should never wed!' answered the princess, with downcast eyes. 'This is our oath!' ' It will be a pity if hearts that love like yours may never be united.' ' If not on earth, in heaven!' ' Whby did you make this vow?' ' Wilt thou hear my story, sweet Dona Re- becca?'    ' 'Gladly.' ' I was in a convent. I had been committed to it for life-wedded to Heaven. Near this convent was a castle, its lofty towers overshading our gardens. I had forgotten the world, or rather tried to do so, by thinking of the angels ' and paradise; for, as my royal uncle had shut me out of the world for safe keeping, lest I   should interfere with his claims to the throne of Spain, I feared all mankind.' ' Had you never loved, lady?' ' No. I was but fourteen when I was im- mured in the convent; and until eighteen, I never knew there was such a passion as love.' ' And how were you at length taught this sweet emotion, lady?' ' One moonlight night, as I was walking on the latticed terrace, which overlooked the foun- tains of the court, I heard a voice singing in a low cadence, most musically and touching. I listened, eneaptured. It was a male voice, and never before had I heard music so noble. In order to discover whence it came, I softly open- ed the lattice and looked forth. All was sud- denly silent. Above me rose, separated only by a narrow stream, the towers of the castle. I leaned forth and listened, thinking the voice came from some gondola gliding down the sil- very tide. All at once it burst forth again up- on the dewy night, and thrilled my very soul. I now perceived that it came from a grated win- dow of a dark tower, called the Cid's donjon, within an arrow's flight of where I stood. I saw the moonlight shine upon a hand that waved from it, as if towards me. A foot-fall caused me to close the lattice; but from that moment my heart was filled with sympathy for the pris- oner, and with the liveliest curiosity to learn who he was!' ' So would any maiden have felt, methinks,' said Rebecca, who listened with deep interest. ' 1 will not detain you, Dona Rebecca, by entering into details. Suffice it for me to say, that it was eight months before I could ascertain the fact, that the prisoner was a nobleman, and son of the half brother of my uncle, and so my cousin.. I discovered it by the same stratagem' which enabled me to convey instruments to him to release himself.' ' By bribing others?' 'Yes, a monk, who aided me in allI desired, After he got so as to leave lis cell by the win- dow, he would descend from it by a rope every night; and climbing our convent walls, pass hours in sweet converse with me.'   ' How could you be undiscovered?' ' The superior was my friend. She was op- posed from the first, to my treatment by my un- cle. She therefore permitted- our stolen inter- views. Month after month, Don Enrique, for thou hast guessed it was he no doubt, tried to prevail on the superior to suffer me to escape with him! But this she firmly opposed, saying, she was willing that two cousins, both prisoners, should meet, but she dared not connive at their elopement. "You, Don Enrique, she would say, ate a prisoner of state, and if you took her, whither would you fly to be safe with her, when pursuit would be at once made for you! No, no! And there is a law of the order, that no nun shall go forth from these walls, to marry, save to wear a crown as a bride!" ' 'Then,' said Don Enrique, ' I will seek to win her a crown i' ' We little then understood the purpose hq had in his mind. The same night he came from his prison to me to say he was going to escape, altogether, but would return ere long to lead me to a throne I' 'And had he returned every night to his prison again, all this while?' asked the Jewess. 'Always. No one ever suspected that he did not remain in it, wholly.' -     a 'Why, if he could escape for a short time, did he not leave it altogether?' 'He wished- to be near me,' answered the princess, naively. ' True! I did not think of that? How gal- lant he was I  And how long was he absent?' 'Six weeks. . He then came to the convent disguised as a monk.  Here he told me that he had formed a conspiracy for separating Cuba (where his father had formerly large possessions, of which the crown had robbed 'him,) from Spain and erecting it into a separate empire in order to crown me its empress. He said he had consulted with many nobles and  men of influ- ence, opposed to the government, who would contribute men and funds; and  that he would r soon be ready to embark if .I would accompany him. At length, the superior consented, provi- ded I would make an oath not to wed until I  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7455-00000039"/> was crowned, and in failure of the conspiracy to return to the convent.' 'And the oath, you took I' ' Both of us.' ' And did Don Enrique escape with you?' 'You shall hear,' she answered, after a mo- ment's silence, as if recollecting the past. CHAPTER XII. " Who will speak treason in our ear?' HE Jewess, who had listened with deep attention to the narrative of Dona Ma- riana, now bent forward with increased interest to hear the issue of the romantic tale. 'It was decided,' resumed Don Mariana, ' that Enrique should make all preparations for our embarkation to Cuba, and return for me in four days. But he had no sooner left the con- vent than he was arrested, and without explana- tion dragged to a prison near the sea-shore, and there immured in a dungeon. At the same time orders were sent to the convent for my ar- rest, and in the night I was conveyed away and placed in a strong room in the castle, wherein Don Enrique had originally been confined. :The superior of the convent was also imprisoned in the cells which constitute a portion of the palace of the archbishop.' ' Who had betrayed you?' ' The monk, who had been bribed by me.- Treacherous to his order in aiding me at first, he had become naturally treacherous to me; and having overheard the plan of the conspiracy, as Enrique talked it over with me, he had finally communicated his information to my uncle. The result was the arrest of all parties.' ' And how did you escape?'  ' You shall hear. A few weeks after the ar- rest and imprisonment of Don Enrique in the castle by the sea, a shck of an earthquake, like the finger of Providence interposing in our be- half, threw down the ,whole face of the prison walls on the side by the sea and exposed his cell broadly open to the light and air. He had nothing to do but to step out and descend the rocks to the sea-side, where he found a boat,   which he took to aid him in his flight. In this boat be reached a secluded bay not far down the coast, where he had previously prepared a vessel to meet him. The vessel was, fortunate- ly, still in waiting, and received him gladly.- Without delay he disembarked from her in dis- guise; and after having called upon some of the chief conspirators to show himself to them in person and renew their confidence, he received their re-assurances of support in the magnificent emprise he contemplated. He then made his way to the convent, and there learned from a peasant my arrest and imprisonment. Accus- tomed to scale the castle walls to the window where he had been confined, and from which he used to descend in his visits to me, he was not long in scaling the tower. He found that the bars of the window were seemingly whole, but really parted, as he had left them. He soon entered his old cell and made his way into the interior of the prison. He came upon a sentry and took him captive, and compelled him to inform him in which apartment I was confined. He was soon at the door of my prison. In a few minutes he had effected an entrance. I was folded in his -arms before I ivell realized who was my deliverer. In silence he led me across the court, and to the portion of the outer gate, which he opened from the inside. Horses were in waiting, and the morning's dawn broke upon us at ten leagues distance from the prison, with the blue sea in sight and the graceful craft in which we were to embark, riding like a swan upon the bosom of the bay. After two very narrow escapes from detection, in one of which perils we were assisted by a faithful innkeeper, whose hostel was on the shore of the sea, we at length reached the Bel Isabel, which was the name of the schooner that was in waiting for us; and which had formerly been a favorite yacht of Don Enrique, before his imprisonment. I did not, however, go on board the schooner in fe- male attire. This I exchanged,' continued Dona Mariana smiling, but blushing, ' for that of a youth, at the request of Don Enrique, who said my safety would depend upon it. I chang- ed my name, too, from Garcillato Garcilaso, and acted as his secretary on board.   'This is romantic enough, for a romance,' fi said the handsome Jewess.          d 'It was, however, attended with  serious t alarms. We had no sooner set sail from the e bay, than a large. ship-of-war, which had been I hovering on the coast drew near, and gave chase r to us. Don Enrique, with a spy-glass, recog-  nized her as one of the fasteSt ships in the royal I navy. He said that no doubt he had been ( watched by spies, and the fact. made known to t the government that he had a vessel in prepara- tion, and that they had waited until we were E both on board together, before they attempted 1 the rescue of either.' ' And how did you escape 7' 'By the exercise of the utmost vigilance on the part of Don Enrique, and the skill of the : seamen. We were pursued day and night along  i the coast of Grenada, and past the rock of Gib- ralfar, sometimes being so near the frigate as 4 for his cannon-balls to reach us. We came near being captured by her a score of times,1till we at length came in sigflt of Cuba, when, four days ago, we were compelled to leave her and escape to the shore, as the frigate would in a few minutes be aboard. of us. It was about forty-five miles from Alatanzas, or nine east of Cardenas, that we made the shore. Here,-after remaining allnight ina rendezvousof buccaneers, we reached Havana this morning.' ' You, in your boy's costume t' ' Yes, senoral I came hither as a fisherman, Don Enrique and I. If you will look in this wardrobe, you will see my disguise!' The beautiful Jewess, having sufficiently ex- pressed her surprise at the narration she had listened to, and her admiration at the courage of the maiden who had endured so many hard- ships, soon after left her apartment and sought the presence of her father. As she went through the hall, she saw Don Enrique engaged at a table, examining written papers. As he did not immediately observe her, she lingered an instant to gaze on his noble profile, his lordly bearing, and striking, chival- rous appearance. Sadly she shook her head. ' Two noble pair I Both fair and high-born,   fitted by Heaven for each other! But what a dark destiny will be theirs! The scheme of es- tablishing a throne in Cuba can never succeed, even with the illustrious prestige of iuch a princely presence. They are destined to fail  That noble head will fall upon the scaffold, and Princess Garcilla will either die by his side, or be immured again forever in the walls of the convent from which she has escaped, and where the policy of her royal uncle placed her.' At this moment, Don Enrique, perhaps in- stinctively conscious of being regarded, looked up and encountered her eyes. He at once arose and approached her. ' Fair Jewess, if Cuba numbers among its daughters but few more like thee, their smiles alone will light us to the throne that glitters be- fore me!' ' I am but a poor Jewess, senor. My influ- ence in such a cause would weigh nothing.- Were I Spanish-born--' 'Nay, of what nation art thou, if thou art not Spanish, and thy father's before thee. Thou hast no land nor kingdom, no hone nor coun- try, thy proud race, if not that where thou art born; and yet you will still call yourselves Jews, though the land of JudaIh, hati en for two thousand years in the hands of the infidels. But thy father's influence, lady, if not thine, is mighty in our cause, and we are grateful for it. In due time this gratitude shall take a more tangible form than words. Don Baltazar shall 3 be called to hold the highest gift in my realm, the station of prime minister.' Dona Rebecca only bowed. She was moving [ on, when the nobleman drew near her, and said: Can I have audience for a brief while with Dona Mariana?' t   I will convey to her thy wishes, senor I But if thou wilt enter the boudoir by that door thou i wilt find her, my lord, engaged in reading a i letter.' B  The Jewess then moved forward with that e stately, graceful, undulating motion, which is  characteristic only of the orientalist, and dis- appeared from the following gaze of Don En- , rique. He now advanced to the boudoir. The '   &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7455-00000040"/> door was ajar. He tapped lightly and obeyed a voice which bade him enter. Upon seeing him the princess bounded for- ward and fell upon his bosom. She seemed to be in tears. ' What aileth thee, sweet? Art thou not happy now ' 'I fear the worst!' she said with emotion. ' I have ever doubted the issue!' ' What now, lady? What night-mare hath disturbed thee V' he said tenderly, and playing with a tress of, her hair as he led her to a seat. ' No night-mare, my lord I! If we are de- ceived in one friend we may, be in-naany 1' ' What hast thou discovered? It would seem the news would lay in the letter you hold in your hand.' ' It does, my lord, briefly, but piercing like a dagger. She whom I looked to for counsel and sympathy, to be our foe-or, rather, not to be our friend!' 'Nay-but of whom dost thou speak?' 'Of the lovely Jewess!' ' Don Baltazar's daughter ' ' Yes, my lord!' ' What hast thou discovered?' 'Read this, Enrique! She gave it me as she went out not long since.' The prince read as follows, written in a beau- tiful Italian hand: ' LOVELY PRINCESS: ' It is my painful duty to undeceive you and Don Enrique touching my political sym- pathies with the party you represent. It is not honest in me to avail myself of your confidence, and to listen to your plans, when I am far from being a friend to the proposed scheme of estab- lishing an empire in these Indian isles. Bitterly as I, with thousands of others, lament our po- litical connection with Spain, it is better that it should exist as it does this day, than be ex- changed for another form of monarchy. 1 have no doubt but that you would be a gentle and wise empress, and Don Enrique a prudent and just monarch. But I am opposed to thrones and crowns and sceptred power in whatsoever form. I am an American woman in heart and opinions.  If we have any change of our rela- tions, as a state, let it be not from monarchy to   monarchy, but to republicanism. My father is your true and loyal partizan. He believes le to be so also. I have deceived him, not wishing to wound him; but now that the conspiracy hath taken the head it has, and reached the im- portant period when the very prince and prin- cess around whom the hopes of my father and his friends are rallied, have landed upon this island, I can no longer conceal my real senti- ments either from him or you! Permit me, however, to love you as a friend, while I oppose you as a princess, and the contemplated empress of these islands. REBECCA BE BALTAZAR.' Don Enrique, having perused this letter, re- mained for a moment buried in thought. Dona Garcilla fixed her dark eyes upon his face inqui- ringly. At length he looked in her eyes and smiled encouragingly. ' Well, -this is frank and honest! We should respect such a'spirit as this. Although I wish she were with us, yet her loss is but the loss of one, sweet!  Her father is still true! Were it he, it would be a grave affair. As it is, let it not trouble thee; especially as she is willing to be thy friend. Receive her as' such, and let no word pass between thee about pblitics.' ' She will not betray us?' ' No! A woman who could write thus has no treachery in her. Trust her with every se- cret of thy soul, save those that effect politics. And now this great matter, sweet, which made thee look, when I entered, as if you had heard of some irretrievable calamity--now that it is r so little after all, I have no doubt but that the affair at Cape de Piedras, where we passed the night among the pirates, was'of as little mo- ment. Art thou not ready to tell it me? Me- thinks thou wert to reveal it to me when we were safely in Havana?   Nay, if the thought of it makes thee pale-' 'No, Enrique I   Thou shalt now hear! Lis- ten. I  am here released from -my vow. The night we passed on the cape, after I had some time retired, I felt oppressed for air, and rose and- went forth. I intended to walk but a little way from the camp, but, tempted by the beauty of the night, I wandered on until I came to a ruin which overhung the sea". Here I  remained   some time admiring the moonlit waves, when I discerned the shadow of a man along the par- apet. I immediately turned to retire quickly from the place, when a person appeared openly in view and pursued me. I fled like a deer. I bweame involved in the winding of a fosse, and, unable to get out of it, I ran and gained a door which opened into a vault at the extremity. Here I quickly shut myself in, and waited in silence and fear. I must have stood there a quarter of an hour, breathless, when, finding I was not pursued, I resolved to venture out. Butin'the darkness I could not find the door again, and while I was feeling about the damp walls I saw the faint glimmer of a light on my left. Supposing this to come from the door, I approached it, over a stone floor, damp and slip- pery: Upon reaching it, I discovered that it came. from an innerdoor which was ajar. Peep- ing cautiously through it, I beheld an interior chamber of the vault. It was rudely furnished for habitation. The only occupant it contained, was a venerable, proud-eyed old woman-or rather lady (for such she seemed in all her meanness) , who was kneeling before a rucifix in prayer. But I had hardly fixed my eyes upon her, when a grated window, which let moon- beamns into the vaulted chamber, swung slowly back above her head,'and a man entered, and, noiseless, lowered himself down into, the room behind her. At first I thought it was my pur- suer; but I saw this pers6n was much taller and slenderer. He approached the woman, and, taking her by the throat, he confronted himself with her. She struggled, but in vain, and called him by some name which I did not hear. ' Woman, those papers!' he demanded in a hoarse tone. . 'I will have them now!' ' Never!' she answered. ' You have kept me from my birth-right. I am your eldest born, and you know it! You bore me before Silvestre or Beatrice,roy sisters. You keep the titles of my rank and name for that monstrous abortion.' 'You are not my son-I adopted thee,' said the woman, as he- released her throat to clutch a dagger. 'Thy mother died by the hands of the   executioner, if thou would'st know it, and thy father in chains in the galleys-both for unheard of crimes. I took pity on thee, and called thee mine, to conceal thy shame till thou didst grow up and play the tyrant over Silvestre, and repay my charity to thee by ingratitude. Then I cast thee off, but not because I would supplant thee by Silvestre. He is my only son, and the only heir to the estates, that, if there be a change of rulers in Cuba, will one day be his!' 'Thouliest, woman,' shrieked the man. This estate is to come to me I I am thy son, and I will not be cheated out of my birthright by this dwarfed Jacob. Dost thou hear me, woman? Give me the papers that will make this estate mine, as thy eldest son.' ' I swear to thee, never!' she replied, firmly. ' Then I will slay thee and take them from around thy body!' ' As he spoke he raised the glittering weapon, and I saw it descend into her bosom. Already I had uttered a shriek, and impulsively rushed forward to save her. It was too late. She fell over dead, and her life-blood spouted upon my hand I' ' I understand now-go on,' murmured half audibly Don Enrique, ' go on!' ' He saw me appear, with surprise as great as if I had descended from heaven before him! Ie started back, drawing the dagger from her heart, and gazed at me for a moment, as if measuring me from head to foot. ' What dost thou here T' he demanded, at the same time spriqging towards me. ' Thou hast been witness to a deed, boy, that should have no witnesses. ' The secret must die with thee!' and he elevated the steel above my head. 'Spare me,' Hcried. 'I will swear to thee that I will never betray thee!' ' I struggled with him, and he threw me on to the ground upon my knees. He was about to strike, when he paused and laughed recklessly, saying: ' What. do I care whether it be known or no? What is one crime, more or less? I fear no re- sult. I will let thee go, boy, he added, address- ing me, if thou wilt make oath' that thou wilt  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7455-00000041"/> not speak of this to mortal -man until three days are past. Wilt thou swear?' ' I swear it, never to speak of it,' I an- swered. 'I care not, after three days, to whom it is blabbed,' he answered, with fiendish careless- ness. ' Having taken the oath, he made me climb up the wall to the half-moon window, by which he had descended into the vault, and bade me fly. I did not wait a second time to be bidden; and in a few moments I had reached the ground out- side, and was escaping with great rapidity, when I was stopped by the sight of a body in the way. A second glance told me it was Don - Pelayo.' ' Don Pelayo dead?' exclaimed Enrique, with amazement. ' He was not then. He was wounded and dying. I knew his voice as he feebly called to me; and tried'to stop the blood from a wound in his side. He said it would be of no avail. He wished me to give his last blessing to thee, and to tell thee that he died praying for thy suc- cess l' ' Poor Balco! and did he die?' ' In a few, minutes. When I saw he was ho more, I covered the body with the leafy branch- es of trees, and left it.' 'Then this mystery is solved. I wondered he came iot. But did he tell thee who did tHis foul dee?' 'Yes-the hunchback.' ' Ah, yes-I know him! We saw him that night. Had they a quarrel?' ' Don Pelayo said he took him to be a spy, and so struck him down.' ' Ah, so? Then the hunchback is not of us, certainly. I will remember him well for this ;' said Don Enrique, sternly. Brave Don Pe- layo! I will avenge thy death when the heav- ier matters that now press upon me shall be at- tained.' ' You speak of power as emperor, Enrique, always as if the sceptre was in thy grasp; while I dare not even trust my thoughts with the idea. There are so many vicissitudes. This letter of Dona Rebecca!'   'Is nothing. Half the best families in Cuba, Don Baltazar assures me, are in favor of the empire.' ' I fear they will love a republic more. The vicinity of Cuba to the land of the warlike and free Americans, will tempt them to desire the same liberty.' ' Not so. Perhaps a few of the commercial people may; butthe best blood of Cuba-the descendants of the hidalgos of Spain--the mon- archists of the island-if they break off from Spain, must have the empire. This is their aim; and we, dearest Mariana, are the centre of their hopes. This very night there will be a council of the imperial party in this house; and all our plans and future movements decided on.' ' Heaven grant thee and them success!' an- swered the princess.  ' I aim not so much at power, Enrique-I desire not to be empress for the grandeur which a throne confers-but it is only as empress I can be what I still more high- ly prize-thy wife!' He pressed her to his heart, and Dona Rebec- ca entering at. that moment, he took his leave. He saw, however, that the Jewess looked troub- led, as she came in. Dona Mariana noticed her agitation, but without speaking to her, Rebec- ca passed through the boudoir to an inner room. Here, when alone, she .drew from her bosom the paper sent by the sentry, and re-read it. ' Theodore in prison I and in the palace yard too!  This is fearful news! I will indeed put my woman's wits to work, as he says. But what-shall I do?  Be still, my heart, and let me think!' she said, pressing her hand upon her bosom. After a few moments' reflection on the course that she ought to pursue, a thought seemed suddenly to strike her mind. It was a happy one, for it made her eyes light up. Taking her mantilla and casting it about her face, she left the house secretly, and sought the!Guarda Cu- bana, a'place where dwelt the families of many, of the soldiers. She stopped at a house of a very humble exterior.  At the door stood the man who had brought the note, and whom she had  recognized. Upon seeing her, the- man   raised his cap with a grateful air, and alled 'her by name.  She said a few :words to him-, when he left his door, and followed her up the street. The :evening of the assembling of the con- spirators in the house of the rieh Jbw, at length,: east its shadows-over the eity.: ' Don Baltazar, himself, stood at the gate and:admitted theeon- spirators one by one after heiaring them whisper inmhis ear the pasS-word by Whioh they were; to be known. '         . At length, when twenty-four gentlemeni had been reeived, the Jew locked -and barred his gate,- and placing the key in his belt, followed the last of the guests to an apartmenth in, the extremity of the south wing of his mansion.-- s  He entered it and closed and: looked the door and let fall a thick curtain before it to deaden the transmission of all sound from within,- When he entered, the caballeros, who had pre- viously assembled, were convering together in knots in the room. It wasa long and high chamber, so closely curtained 'that no windows were seen. It was lighted by half a score of wax'candies in silver candelabfa. At one ex- tremity was a table covered' With a blue cloth; laced with a silver edging. Around the tablel were placed chairs for the 6onspirators.' The meeting being called to order by Dot Baltazar, he addressed them by' formally an- nouncing the arrival of .the Prince Enrique and the Princess of Campobello, an event already known to them. 'He thein rose, and'going be- hind a curtain' of arras;, i appeared- with, Don Enrique and introduced him to the conspirators. Some of the younger members would have hail. ed him with shouts-but for the more ieautious example of the older eawaliers. His receptihon was most enthusiastic by all: Some kissed his hand; otters grasped it; wlhie others who had known his father, embraced him. ' Every one, moreover, expressed one to the other their ad-. miration of his appearance. Having been Wlcoined in an address which was ptonounced by ani old hoble, who sketched a brief outline of the object of the conspiracy, Don Enrique rejoined in a speech that won eve- ry heart, and inspired them with the liveliest , 6   enthusiasm. "When, at the close of his address he introduced the princess, the excitement, of the gentlemen was unbounded. . Nearly every manhknelt before .the lovely woman and ' swore allegiance to her eause., Her grace and beauty charmed and captivated all present. The business of the council now began in earnest. Letters which Don Enriquqbadbrought were read, and produced the liveliest satisfac. tion. They were from' opulbnt and influential men in Spain, who pledged themselves to ad- vance money to the amount of one and a half milloions;; and to raise two regiments. The let, ters being read and commented upon, the gen- tlemen presenit then- advanced to the table and eah' wrote opposite Ms nam6 the amount of money lie would stand pledged for; and the number of men he could raise. When all this was done, Don Enrique, who assumed at once, as if by tight, the control of the meeting, read over the amounts of tmen, money and Ve'els that dotild be depefided oh: 'From Spain, in money, '$1',000tO. ' Frbo Spain, in men, 3000. In   Cuba,'in money, $2,000,000." Men in' Cuba and   adjaceit M. ands, 12,000.' . '     * v The offieerb were then appointed and commis- sioned, eimbraoing' every conspirator in the room. Besides daptain,;' colonels :and others of rank, four of the gentlemen piesent received from the Prince Enrique commissions as major-generals. To himself was left' the superior rank of lieu- iteniantgeneral of :tie whole' army. Among the conspirators, Ddn Baltazar; who was appointed treasurer and commissary general, pointed out to Don Enrique gentlemen representing all the islandb of the West Indian group; for thistcon- spiracy had extended its' ramifications to every individual islabd of the brilliant constellation. !'

We will not, however anticipate, but take the reader to another meeting of plotters which took place in Havana the same night, but in a remote quarter of the city nearer the sea. CHAPTER XIII. 'I pale? The free know no blanching cheek.' i  HE reader will remember that on the night on which we have seen the chief Lopez embark in the little vesselwhich was to take him to the States in company with the two American generals, there landed from the sloop a young Cuban, named Don Rinaldo. This gallant isl- ander had just returned from a secret mission to the United States, where he had succeEsflly ac- oomplished all that he had been directed by the liberators to undertake.. We have seen him, after a brief delay at the villa of Don Pedro Guzman, the coffee planter, mount his saddle and take the road for the capital. He did not reach Havana without many ad- ventures, passing on the, road. now a troop of lancers watching the coast, now a detachment of infatry, marching to reinforce some point which Senor Roneali, the captain-general, supposed menaced by the invaders whom the Cuban gov- ernor's imagination magnified to a host of not less than one hundred and fifty thousand Anglo- Saxons, every one of them:having been weaned on gunpowder pap, and out/their teeth on a re- volver or bowie knife. In the pretty town of Cardenas, as our horse- man rode through it, he, saw but few troops, and the good: people seemed to think that the inva- ders would hardly troublethemselves about such an obscure place as theirs, while Havana lay nigher the States. Some of the citizens averred that if they came they wouldc give them a good reception; and Don Rinaldo left Cardenas well satisftied in his own mind:that the liberating ar- my ought to -land anywhere but at a point so truly Spanish and Castilian.   '. This place,' .he:said, to himself, 'is -chiefly occupied by old country families, and they are so king-ridden that they turn pale at the mention of the name of Lopez; for,: thanks to the cap- tain geperal, everybody seems to know that the invasion is to take place and who is its leader. I will as soon as I reach Havana despatch intel- ligence to New Orleans, warninghim not toland at Cardenas, which he has some thoughts of do- ing. If the force be strong enough, he had bet- ter'attack Matanzas at once.' Thus musing and resolving, the young Cuban rode on. A few miles from Havana he was met by a courier, who, in reply to his inquiry, in- formed him that he was bearer of a proclamation from El Senor Roneali, captain-general, declar- ing all slaves free mwho would rise to aid i;nre. pelling invasion or attacking rebellious Cubans, who might aid it. The, cheek of; the young pa- triot burned at this brutal mandate, and in order to diminish the influence of such a mischievous order, he took the courier prisoner, despoiled him of his papers which were directed to a com- mandant of a district. He placed the man in charge of some fishermen whom he knew, pay- ing them to hold him prisoner ten days. Two hours' ride from Havana, as be was riding near a littlfie bay, he saw an African slaver at anchor, and landing from her, or already drawn upon the shore, were four hundred naked and barbarous Africans.  'And to whom do these belong?' he asked, ,of .an officer of the government, who was collect- ing an ounce per head from the slavers for each slave landed. ',To Don Juan de Callaca,' answered the of- ficer of :tolls, as he marked down a new number. ' This is his eighth cargo this year.' '.And for each:of these the captain-general has-received,-'       . ; 'An onza,. senor.' ' Sixteen dollars a-piece will soon make six- teenmillions, if this be the way we drain Africa.' ' Ah, sehor, his excellencyr has made not less than one million of hard :pesos;by the claved, but he has made anothher out of the particular new taxes,    ,  I        1"' ' . .   Don Rinaldo rode on, thinking that the soure. es of Senor Roncali's unrighteous wealth would soon be stopped. At length he entered Havana, the gates of which he found guarded, as'if it had been a beleagured city. He took his way towards a dwelling which was on that side of the town nearest the water, and the roof of which commanded a view of the ocean; we do not like : to be more particular, lest, if our tale be trans- lated into Spanish, as we have no doubt but that it will, and our friend Senor Roneali, to whom we have been indebted for hospitalities, should read it, he might be malicious enough to do our friends mischief. Therefore, if we- do not particularize localities by street and number, our readers will know the cause and overlook it, in consideration of the motive we have in view. Don Rinaldo, having reached this noble man- sion and entered it, horse and all, through the arched gate-way that led into the central court, was ushered up stairs into a room sumptuously furnished. A window opened upon the sea, and by it stood a gentleman with a spy-glass at his eye. He welcomed Don Rinaldo with great warmth, and sat two hours listening to all he had to tell him touching his expedition to the American shores. The report brought by the young Cuban appeared highly satisfactory to the gentleman, who embraced him a second time in token of his approbation. The gentleman was an intellectual looking man, with a soholar's brow and a soldier's eye. His mouth was ex- pressive of decision, and his air was chivalric and commanding; yet, in stature he was under the ordinary size. ' I am glad you are pleased, Senor Gonzales,' said the young Cuban. : You have won immortal laurels, Rinaldo I At one time I trembled for you I Your depart- ure was betrayed, and Roncali despatehed a ves- sel after you. How many hours I watched the sea from this window to see if youl were to re- turn captive; and you may judge my delight when I beheld the war-vessel 6ome:back alone as she went out I A hundred hearts beat anx- iously for your safety and rejoiced in the issue 1' ' What do you look for now at sea?'   ' The fishing-smack, that is to take me to the island Mugeres or Contoy, to join the gulf squad- ron from Louisiana. Young Captain Theodore Decatur is to accompany me. Do you know him?' 'No. ' He is a noble American seaman, who has resigned his commission to aid our cause. He will be here to dine. To-night, now that you have arrived, I will have our friends here and report progress.' The night came, and with it assembled not less than seventy brave men, who had sworn to die upon the altar of Cuban liberty, or free her and give her place among the nations. Among them was no kingly aspirant for a throne. Seep tres and crowns they would have trampled un- der foot. The intelligence which Rinaldo brought, was received by them with deep and silent joy.-- They saw already the dawn of the island repub. lio. In the awakened enthusiasm of the mo- ment, Senor Gonzales springing upon a tribune upon which stood the statue of Liberty, unfurled and flung broadly befdre all eyes the glittering sTAR of the ISLES, emblazoned on a barred belt of crimson, crossed by white stripes. A sup- pressed huzza greeted the first unfolding of the flag of the liberating army in the very heart of the capital of Cuba. After' waving it thrie, the chivalrous Gonzales placed the staff in the grasp of the hand of the goddess of liberty, and its folds fell about her like a veil of glory. The proposed invasion was now discussed in all its features-and the best place of descent considered. A few were in favor of Cardenas; but the majority approved of a direct landing at Matanzms. In the midst of their discussions, and while Senor Gonzales was much troubledin his mind at th0 non-arrival of Theodore, a noise was heard at the gate. Upon going to it ,the young American himself was admitted by Senor Gonzales, accompanied by a veiled lady. 'Hast thou never a priest at hand, good Gon- zales ' demanded Theodore.. ' Who and what is this?' asked the Cuban, as he locked the gate.  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7455-00000043"/> 'iThis is the daughter of the fair rich Jew Baltazar. We have long been lovers. To-day she heard of my arrest--' 'You arrested? I half guessed and feared it!' answered Senor Gonzales, taking the lady's hand. ' Sehora, I know you well through the reputation of your beauty, and that you have become a Christian; but I did not know that my mercurial American friend kriew thee!'  ' Four years ago in Spain-but she was a Jewess then,-now she is a Christian. Wilt thou send for a priest? . We are to be married forthwith! ' Most assuredly thou shalt have the priest- and most welcome the marriage! But explain l' 'Iwill explain, Senor Gonzales,' answered the lovely Jewess, fixing her glorious eyes on the Cuban leader. 'As Don Theodore says, we knew one another in Spain four years ago. Here, yesterday, we met by accident. To-day, this afternoon, I learned from a note written by him, that he had been arrested by Senor Ron- ali, and was in the palace prison!' By Ronoali I Then he knows who you are! You are not safe another hour in Cuba!' said one of the liberators; for the conversation had brought the parties to the hall, and the Cubans were surrounding and listening to Theodore and Dona Rebecca with deep attention. ' Donot, I pray you, caballeros, interrupt La Senora Baltiaar,' said Gonzales, with a cour- teous gesture of silence to those around, among whom the beautiful Jewess stood self-possessed, yet blushing with maidenly reserve*   . 4 I had no sooner heard of this arrest, than I resolved to try and effect his release,' continued the maiden; 'for I knew how much his pres- enee was needed to advance the cause of liberty 1' ' Thou a liberatrice!' ejaculated Seno, Geon- sides. ' Pardons me" lady, but today I heard that thy father was' a royalist ', ' Not exactly a royalist, senores, in your mean- ing of the term,' she answered. *'But. I can be betrayer of no confidence that has been re- posed in me unwittingly. Whatever my father may be, I am a repuiblican!'  I   Bravo If Bravissimo i' cried several of the young and ardent HTabaneros present, clapping their hands, and then smoking away at their ci- garritos, as if they were were puffing incense before her as to the living goddess of liberty. 'I recollected the face of the man who had brought me the note. I had aided him a year before in poverty, and I had released his aged father from prison whenhe was incarcerated for a debt. I should never have thought of these things again, but for the emergency in which the arrest of Don Theodore placed me. I there- fore determined to make capital of my former benevolence, gentlemen; not a very praise- worthy habit, but one I trust which will be ex- cusable under the circumstances. I sought the man who was a soldier of the palace guard.-- He recognized my claim upon him. The result was the liberation by his means of Don Theo- dore, and the flight of the soldier whom I en- riched, and who will leave for the States. Up- on going after dark to-night to my father's house, to obtain the gold which I wished to pay the soldier, I found that rmy father had learned that I was a friend to the Americans, and I had no sooner entered, than he upbraided me with treachery, and brdered me to be locked in a cell where he keeps refractory slaves. This order was overheard by Theodore, who had accompa- nied me to the gate, and aided by the soldier, he forced the gate and rescued me!' 'Bravo! Bravissimo!' applauded the young- er portion of the liberators. ' I then,' resumed Theodore, ' prevailed upon my generous deliverer to unite her destiny with my own. We have reaihed in safety this place, and now, my brave- companions, I invite you to consecrate this hour by the union of America with Cuba, in the esacri nuptials about to be performed I' Among- the revolutionists was a youthful priest of the Roman church, who consented to perform the ceremony;. and before the altar of liberty, under the shadow of the republican fag of Cuba, held above their heads by the goddess of liberty, this utaion of love, symbolical of the union political of America and Cuba, was sealed.   The same hour a messenger eame from the sea-side, informing Senor Gonzales that the ves. sel was waiting his command which was to bear him to the standards of the liberating army.- Under the circumstances of the escape of Theoe dore, and the importance of his immediate se. curity, Senor Gonzales resolved' to embark with- out delay, accompanied by Theodorte and his bride. Before parting, however, and the final breaking up of the meeting of liberators, the duties of each one was asettled, the rank each was to hold in the revolutionary army fixed, and the post to be occupied by all, when they should hear of the landing of Lopez and the American generals, established clearly. At eleven o'clock this important council of libera, tors broke up, and each member under various disguises sought his own abode. The cathedral bell was chiming the midnight vigil in tones that seemed to come from the sepulchres be- neath the earth, when, Senor Gonzales, accom- panied by Theodore and his, beautiful bride, se- cretly made their way to the sea-side, and em- barked on the vessel which was to take them to the continent of America, and landing them at the Balize, agive the gentlemen the opportunity they sought of joining the expedition, which they knew was about to sail from New Orleans. After a short passagebthey reached the hand- some capital of the. south-west, and here found General Lopez and his warlike friends all ready to take the first step towards embarking the troops. Theodorwevas receivedaby the officers, and especially by the general-in-chief, with eve- ry demonstration of gratification; and the com- mand of the vessels that should corupose the army of liberation was offered to him and ac- cepted by him prospectively. OX the evening of the second of May; with our youthful bridegroom on boardi the expedition for the invasion of the island seeretly left the waters of New Orleans; and stretched southward intp the open gulf. It was with nolittle reluc- tance that Theodore left his fair bride behind among his friends; but the beelk of ambition was more enticing even   than the claims of love.   After^a tedious passage across the gulf, the expedition made the island of Contoy; andbe, ing joined off the coast of Yucatan by another division of their army, they proceeded towards Cuba, for the purpose of making alanding and surprising the town of Cardenas, from which point Lopez expected to command all the arte- ries of the interior, and to menace Havana itself, Leaving this daring expedition on its course over the 'Glad waters of the dark blue sea,' we will return to Havana, and take the reader, if he will have the courtesy to follow us, to the palace of the captain-general of Ouba, the head of the power against which this secret expedi- tion was advancing. The sun had just set on the day preceding the night on whioh the invaders hoped to make their descent upon the northern coast, when a till, dark faced man might have been seen pacing up and down in a saloon of the vise-royal palace, buried in deep thought. The magnificenoe of the apartment, which was furnished with all those features of splendor and wealth' that cau only be equalled in the gorgeous abodes of Spanish' princes, drew no glance from ht eye; for the outward show which dazzles the eyes of the poor, palls the vision of the great, and though they suriound 'themselves with these things, they take in them no pleasure. But had he the leisure and taste to admire the su.\ perb painting, the symmetrical statuary, the thousand elegant luxuries of, art about him, he was not in the mood. The weight of a mensac ed division of the empire, of Spain, and the most'valuable of all her possessions was upon his shoulders. He saw a cloud gathering around him, that only courage, prudence and 'energy could disperse, and bring oncemore the oun. shine of undisturbed repose. Up and down he wialked with a slow and measured pace, never once raising his eyes from the floor. His dark hair mixed with gray, gave him an Air of wisdom; and his bearing as well as his dress showed that he was a soldier. His  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7455-00000044"/> age is about fifty. He looks like a knowing man of the world, and like a shrewd person who tries men before he trusts them; either because he knows men well or knows himself; for there are" men who are suspicious not only from the sxpsienee that the world has given them of the evil of human nature, but -from a profound knowledge of their own depravity. The sparkle of his dark eye is avaricious and silvery, as if he caught it from overmuch counting of Mexi- can dollars. His mouth would be handsome were, it not sensual. His cheek bones are high, and his mustache short, gray and wiry. He looks as much like an Austrian soldier as he does like a nobleman of Spain. This personage is El Senor General, chief captain of the fair island of Cuba, which so many nations are raffling for. He is the rich- est man in Cuba, having the reputation of hav- ing made half a million in the last two years by the onzas per oapitum coming to him as his per- eentage on slaves imported from Africa; and by his exactions of duties upon everything grown in the island but the children of the Cubans. He knows the value of a peso and how many qmrtos make a real, no man better than he I He -has been made ruler of Cuba by the Cortes of Spain, being at home a man popular for his -i nherence to the crown, his monarchical predi- lections and his absolute hatred of republicans, republicanism and republics; he was, therefore, thought a fit man to entrust with a viceregeney so near the shores of that dangerous land of the free,the United States. ;As the wide Atlantic separates him from the realm of Spain, he ap- prehends little danger of.:reproof, should he play the tyrant. He, therefore, haughtily lords it overthe islanders, as 'over a people -made of a .oarser clay; and grinds all beneath him.-- 6 -makes laws for his subjects, and breaks them wantonly himself. He holds himself amenable to no-power; and the slavish submission of the majority of the Cubans has only made him the more despotic. But thisis not the age for tyrants to prosper, or for people to put their necks under yokes.-- Even the breath of liberty, reached the isle of J   the south, and the spirit of freedom kindled the hearts of the children:of the sun. The Cubans began to ask questions? 'When men inquire, there must be thought and reflection behind the inquiry. Men who do not think, ask no ques- tions.; Who is El Senor Don Roneali, our eapl tain-general? .Whence came he? Who sent him? Whence has he this power over us. Did we give it to him? Has he our consent to gov- ern us? Should not men choose their own rul- ers? Should not we, Cubans, have a voice in the election of our own governors? Is it natu- ral for one .prosperousioountry to be governed by another country, -old and decaying at that?' These inquiries the men of Cuba began to make first one of the other; the laborer of his fellow; the fisherman of his comrade; the planter ofhis neighbor; the merchant of his friend. At length they asked their officers, and those in authority, and finally some even dared to question the chief himself as to the source of his authority, and the justice of his power over them. These inquisitive patriots were rewarded by a month or two in the dungeons 'of Moro Oastle; and rewards were given tW eh menials as would inform upon such inquiries   But men's tongues are free. They still asked ques- tions about that great ptwer, fituated three'thou- sand miles distant, to which they paid so many millions annually. -Could we not be governed better by a Cuban of our own choosing? Would not the island be more prosprous if we expend- ed our income in it, instead of sending it away in these millions that are shipped to Spain?- What prevents us from being a free and inde- pendent nation? If we are not strong enough of ourselves to throw off the Spanish yoke, the brave Americans will aid us if we call on them! It is time, then, that Cuba should be free, and we will be free' I' The echo of these stirring inquiries--these bold askings of men in whose bosoms began to kindle the tpark of freedom, reached the ears of itheo aptain-general in the recesses of his pal, ace, and reverberated along his gilded walls and vaulted saloons.   He had twice calleda together his wise men i and held council with them, as Belshamzar did the magicians when he saw. the hand-writing on the wall. He asked them what these murmurs meant; and he was answered, that the people were weary of having masters, and would be free. - Like Pharaoh, then he said, 'Bind on them greater burdens; they are idle, and wax fat, and therefore hatch rebellion. Press the yoke harder upon their necks, and they will have little time to put questions, or to groan l' But the tyrant found that between these groans came curses, deep and earnest., He found to his dismay that their cries reached the continent, where a nation dwells whose pastime it is to topple over thrones, and break sceptres and pull down tyrants! He heard'that they had responded to the call of the crushed Cubans, and would come to their aid l: He heard that Cubans had gone over to them, and received the pledge of assistance by arms. In vain he is- sued proclamations; they were unheeded. He increased his army, called to Spain for help, and tried to rouse the islanders to stand by the throne of Castile. He strengthened his fortresses, he re-garrisoned his castles; he guarded his coasts; he set spies over his friends; he east into prison his foes; he set prices on the heads of the Ameri- cans; and played the tyrant everywhere, in a fashion that rivalled Gessler, the Austrian. He had, however, within a few days, heard of a new conspiracy, which alarmed him equally with that of the revolutionists. He had learned that' a prince and princess of Spain, collateral heirs to the throne, were landed in .Cuba, and would soon elevate an imperial standard, for the establishment of an empire of the isles. He, therefore, on the night we now present him to the reader, had called a council of his advisers, ',of his generals, of his friends and of his tools, to consult on the crisis to which events had at- tained. We here introduce him to the reader,: pacing up and down his council-chamber, ill'at ease. One after another of his couneildrop in. Generals in gold and orange, and glittering in stars; colonels in, blue and: asilver lace;-gay captains with plumes and shining braid; pivil- * 4          \   ians in plain; habiliments; naval officers in the imposing costume of the navy, ' Senores? said the,- captain-general, when all were assembled, ' I have called you to con- sult with you upon the condition of Cuba.- News has to-day reached me that Narcisso Lo- pez has embarked for the United States, where an army of Anglo-Saxons awaits to receive him, and' with which he isto invade the island I Had I heard of his sailing, earlier, I might have ar- rested him 'ere he left our seas. The captain of that part of the coast from which he embarked, has to-day been shot for neglect of duty. I hold here in my hand a letter from the secretary of State of the Ameritan republic, which as- sures me that that government will use every means. to prevent the organizations of a force on its shores; and that it has despatched a fleet to prevent any vessels filled with troops quitting the coast. The letter breathes the warmest friendship to Spain, and declares it will firmly sustain the neutrality between the two nations.' 'Hereupon there was ,a murmur of approba- tion, and a ' Vivan LosEsstcdos Unidos,' from two or three of those present. ' We must, therefore, do our part to take care of these banditti, if they have the boldness to approach our coasts . The captain-general then made known to them what arrangements he had made for the defence of the island, and gave to each officer his partiau- lar instructions. The captain of the war steam- er Pizarro, he directed to embark that'very night and watch the gulf west of St. Antonio, and towards Yucatan; and to the admiral of the fleet he gave orders to hover over the northern coast with strietest, ,vigilance.  Having .given some further directions in reference to the close espionage of all 'American residents, and order- ingtheir immediate arrest in case of invasion, ,he was about to dismiss the council, when a page entered and informed him that the ./Amerioan spy who had been that day taken, had effected his, escape.    ,   ,   ,  Thisinthigence seemed to produce no, little annoyance toRornoali, if one might judge bythe manner in which ho frowned and bit his,lip.-  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7455-00000045"/> But he  id nothing, at the moment.- In a few minutes afterwards, an officer of the navy ais announced, with a repot from sea. :' dmit him,' said Rpneali. 'My lord, said the stranger, upon being ush- ered into the preeene of the captain -general, '      I am directed by my commanding officer to re- port to you that the schooner which was suppos- ed to be a fire'ship, is the very vessel in which the Prince de Espana and the Princess de Cam- pobello escaped from Spain; there is reason to believe from the examination which the pilot of her has, rigidly undergone, that the prince and princess are now bothM this city, in the disguise of common sailors!' This intelligence produced no little sensation among all present,; and Roncali, after talking aside with the messenger, gave directions to sev- eral captains of his police, whom he summoned before him*; and after giving his orders again dismissed them. ' If they are in Havana, they shall be found within four-and-twenty hours,' he said, ass he found hiimself once more alone with one of, his ;generals.  'They shall pay their temerity if they once fall into my hands. By the red cross of Golgotha I what with these two conspiracies I have my hands full.  This American'officer who escaped before he was searched, and who I am assured had on his person letters that would compromiseall his party in Cuba, he must be re- taken.  What ho:! Who is waiting?' i , ' 'No  one, my lord I' answered a beautiful young woman, ;n the pmost captivating dishabille, approaching from an inner room. ' It is only I ' 'Only thou?   What wouldst thou!

Quit iue lt ' You'murdered hber She was the only liv- ing witness you had to fear, and you have-? ' Silence, *oman!' he cried, and pushed her back wiih his broad hand. She would hiave struck the marble floor; but, suddenly, the dwarf 'appeared in the room, and caught her in one arm, while he brandished a stiletto in the other, before the face of the. Spaniard! 'Thou wouldst kill my sister, too!' he screamed. , 'Ho, guards! Arrest this assassin!' ' Not till I have avenged my sister and moth- er, tyrantI' cried Silvestre, laying Beatrice's head upon the floor, and springing upon him. A single blow of the general's sword both parri- ed and laid the dwarf bleeding at his feet. He had sufficient strength to rise half way on his elbow, and with-a smile to bury the stiletto in his sister's bosom. ' Together, Beatrice-together I' ' Senor Roneali stood and gazed on the two corpses for a moment, and then bidding his guards convey them away from sight, he retired with the general into an inner apartment; but iotd without picking up from the floor the dia- Imend-studded  crucifix which had fallen from L the breast of the dead hunchback. The young general with him, who seemed to have been the real cause of the injustice and wrong done to this brother and sister, while the captain-general was the chief object of their vengeance, seemed indifferent to the tragic scene he had witnessed. *I have well got rid,' he said, With a smile of contempt, ' of a troublesonme young girl, for 'whom I no longer 'cared; nd with the hunch- back has perished one frot i whom I have been fearing assassination for a year past, on his sis- teir's aco0unt!'  , 'But didat thou  cause -their mother to be slainT  demsanded the captain-general, something   sternly. 'It was this with which they charged me! This is not the first time I have borne the blame of your follies.'- w 'I Tknow nothing of this woman's death. I swear by the saints I am ignorant of the whole matter, nor knew of her death till now 1' ' I am glad to hear it. Now let us -talk of other matters. This mad Princede Espana, I have certain intelligence, is in the city. Byr to-morrow, I have hopes that' we shall have him in our power.' ' The princess is also with him, and disguised as I heard in the habiliments of a sailor. This is romantic enough. Ah, here comes one of the messengers of the police. 'His face foretells news.'  ' What dost thou bring, that thou comest in such haste?' demanded the chief. ' Intelligence of the prince and princess, your highness.' 'Every word thou sayest on that, shall be worth a golden onza to thee.  Out' with it!' dried Senor de Ronoali. ' Your highness recollects the schooner--' ' The fire:schooier!  Well, what of her?' ' The man' who piloted her in, has been arrest- ed, and confesses that he brought in on board of her two' persons, whom he knew  were not sailors, but persons of ranlk in disguise. He says that-'  The further narrative of the policeman was interrupted bythe entrance of the captain of the frigate, which had pursued the schooner across the ocean. ' I have come, my lord,' he said, after the" first courtesies of salutation were over, to make known to you an extraorditiry circumstance.-- The facts I have just obtained from a man who is now under arrest.'  ' Are they connected with the prince?' They are, my lord.' 'It is, doubtless, what thiis .policeman was about communicating to me, from his chief.- ButI will hear you more readily.'   'The pilot of the schooner, having beenprom- ised a reward if he would make known to me the facts concerning the schooner which created such excitement in coming into the harbor, stated to me as follows: that he is a fisherman, who lives on the coast not many miles east of the Moro. That two persons came to his cove in a boat, and offered him a large sum of money to conveys them safely into the city under cover of the night. That he complied, though he feared that he might get himself into mischief, as he discovered that they were not what they pre. tended to be. Be said that as they were com- ingn-p thqbhabor, a schooner entered under full sail, suppose 'to be a fire-ship, as she did not heed the firing at her from fort and castle. She came so near them that one of his passengers recognized her, and said that it was a vessel he had crossed the ocean in, and no fire-ship; and that he would board her and take her out safely. But it seems he did this, my lord, for fear of being captured in ttle open boat, which the Ben- gal lights showed plainly -to all eyes;, so he had the daring to venture a eorfe opon exposure still by rowing to the schooner, boarding her (as we have alee'ard), and takings her out of: the har- bor. The:pilot says, that after they had taken her out beyond sight of land, they waited for day, hand then re-entered the port boldly, and came past a te all ve ls-of-war in a sort of tri- umph, talking great merit for having made prize of the vessel. But, as the pohooner sailed by our frigate, my lord, I rebognized her as the Bel Isabel, which we bad so long chased. I instantly ordered a boat out to board her, and pulled after her to her anchorage, not a little surprised to find her thus, and with only three persons on board 'of her. But before we could reach her she had come to, and anchored, and the two disguised persons had taken the fisherman's boat and pulled in to the quay, and disappeared.  As the pilot would give no account of himself that was satisfaetory, I sent' him prisoner to my ship, and liave kept 'him there tillmnow, when he has at length given  &#xD;<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7455-00000046"/> me a fll' account of his connection with the' af- fair. '-'The reason he would not do it before, was that'the "' prince," for'there is no doubt but that it is he, and hs princess, both in dis- guise, toald him that he should have half the pr6oeeds of the schooner as soon as he could sell her, "which he could do, as she was a lawful prize. 'But, finding that she was taken posses- sion of by ine, and that h' could gaii nothing by silence, he made known all that he knew, and plainly showing that the schooner, instead of having been a fire-ship, 'had been abandoned at sea, with her canvass spread, anda had been driven by the winds oddly ehnugh, directly into the harbor.'  ' This is a strange account, sir captain,' an-. swered the captain-general. ' It is, indeed, my lord. ' have now'more to say toihing the fugitives.' I will hear, with pleasure, senor,' answered the capta n-general, with al9ok of deep attention. CHAPTER XIV. ;jHE captain of the frigate thus resumed his 4  narrative: "     This revelation made by the fisherman led me to hope that, with judicious steps, the prince and princess might be saken. I had, therefore, every inquiry set on foot'touch- ing the landing of two persons who were partic- ularly described, dressed as seamen. I traced them as far as a shop kept by a wretched Jew in an obscure street; but beyond that I have no trace of them; yet I have my suspicions.' ' Q What said the Jew?' ' He, confessed two suh lpersons had been with him, and he averred that they had bought suits of clothing of him, put thb'm on, leaving their own, andi went away. When I asked for the two suits he said he had :already sold them.' ' An4 you have no further trace?' 'I have my suspicions that a more powerful Jew knows more about' them still,' said the. cap- tain. iE.           -  .    2   'Name him!' 'We are not alone, my 'lord!' ' But first, what is thy tale, police-man?' de- manded the captain-general of the messenger, who had all the while stood aside listening atten- tively,. ' I have been commanded by- my leader to say,-.your highness, that the two persons who came in the schooner are at the house of the rich Jew, Don Baltazar.' ' Is he sure of this?' X ,There is no doubt of it, your worship. He hasafound that two persons have lately become guests there; that the house is kept strictly guarded- from within; that the guests are a young cavalier and a beadtiful lady; and that - they were seen to enter the Jew's clothing store and never go out; and the police know that there is a secret passage between the clothing shop on one street and the palace of, the rich Jew on the other. It is, therefore, my leader's opinion, that the guests of Don Baltazar are the two sailors, and he waits only for an order from your highness to arrest them in the hopse.' ' This must be considered,' said the. captain- general, thoughtfully. I But what would you say to ,me apart, sir captain?' g'No more. The policeman has. said more than I knew. I only guessed that which he seems to have certainty of. I am truly inform- ed that the rich Jew is a friend to the imperial party, which is getting head on the island.' ' I have heard something of it. But I must proceed with caution here, in invading Don Bal- tazar's house. He is rich, and a wrong to him would incense the whole Jewish population. If I were sure of the parties I would not hesitate. I will send for the Jew, to come to the palace. Go,' he added to a page, bgo arid say cour- teously to Don Baltazar, the Jew, that I wish to see him.'  The page departed, and in half an' hour the Jew stood in the presence of the captain-gener- al. He   lookeda littleill at ease, and looked   about him nervously; but he tried to conceal all perturbation, and put on a cool expressibon. ' Mi amigo,' said the island chief, 'you have still moneys to loan, I doubt not?' ' Yes, my lord,' answered Don Baltazar, his whole face brightening up and every suspicion disappearing. 'These preparations we are called upon to make, to defend our island against traitors, call for gold. If we have it not t in our treasures, we must become borrowers! Can you loan me half a million?' ' I will tell you to-morrow, my lord. I will do my best to obtain it. I will give gold rather than you should need it against these Ameri- cans; for one of them has run off with my daughter; poisoned her mind, and-then taught her to play the traitoress to her father's faith and heart. I have cast her out forever! I have sent after her the curse of Abraham and of Noah. Yes, my lord, the money you shall have!' 'Thy daughter gone! Methinks, Baltazar, that thou ravest?   Was not thy daughter seen this last hour in thy house!' ' O, no, my lord, she is fled," answered the Israelite, with an embarrassed air, that did not escape the penetrating eye of the chief. 7 ' What maiden, then, hast thou beneath thy roof?' ' Maiden, my lord,' he exclaimed aghast. ' Or wife! Who are thy two guests?' ' Guests, my lord?' ' The two who came into thy palace in the dress of seamen.' * My lord, IFhave no seamen in my house .' ' I well know who thou hast there, Baltazar. Do not try to"deceive me, or- it will go harder with thee. Thy guests are Enrique de Espana and the princess of Campobello! Darest thou deny it?' rDon Baltazar stood petrified with confusion. He saw that the thing was known, and that further subterfuge would only bring upon him a severer fate for his part in the. matter. ' I do not, my lord. But I crave your mercy, -and mercy for them I'   'We will see about mercy by and-by I Go, sir, policeman, and tell your chief I command him to do his duty, and arrest the two persons at the Jew's house.' There had accompanied Don Baltazar as far as the inner door of the palace, a slender, swarthy man, with an assassin-like visage. He had followed him to beg, and the Jew had giv- en him a piece of gold. , The door being ajar he had peeped and heard what was said. Though his features were in shadow, they were those .of the man whom Dona Garcilla had seen in the vault committing the murder. This man was well known throughout the city, and passed both for an idoit .and a knave; and as he had no regular abiding place, Don Baltazar often gave him food- and shelter, and employed him about his mansion. He had now come to the palace, for he had- heard, out of town, of the tragic death of Beatrice and the hunchback, and sought to lean the facts. With all the half- witted wickedness of his depraved nature, the man was attached to the wealthy Jew. When, therefore, he heard the order given to go to the Jew's house to arrest the two guests, he drew quickly back from the door and darted like a deer out of the palace. Upon reaching the house, he did not enter by the gate, but sealed the wall. He was soon in the presence of our hero and heroine, rho were at the moment talk- ing over their future prospects. ' Py, senor! Escape, lady I The hell-hounds are let loose I' Dona Garcilaso at once recognized the assas- sin of the old woman, and shrunk from his pres- ence with alarm; he, however, in her present female costume, did not recognize the youth he had seen in the vault. ' What is this thou sayest?' demanded the prince. 'I say you   have not a moment to lose. Fly!' 'Heed him not!   He is' the-assassin who slew the old woman I' she said to the prince. Dbn Enrique, however, knew that, there was danger present always before him; and   that  &#xD;<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC7455-00000047"/> warnings should not be lightly heeded, no mat- ter from what source they came. 'Tell thy news! What have we to fear E' ' Art thou not a prince? Is she not a prin- cess?' ' We are then discovered.' ' To be sure.  The governor-general has found out all about you; and has despatched an officer to arrest you both. Don Baltazar is already in the trap! If you stay ten ,minutes you will be no longer free. I give you'this warning because H saw that Don Baltazar was greatly distressed about your being taken, not that I care for you a finger nail. But I do it to please the rich old Jew, who never refused me a piece of gold when I asked for silver, or silver if I was so modest as to ask for copper.' The two fugitives were for a moment in a painful state of uncertainty. A thousand modes of escape passed through Don Enique's mind in an instant, but all unsatisfactory. He trem- bled not for himself, but for the lovely and trust- ing girl at his side. ' Thou hast kindly given us warning. Canst thou aid us in escaping?' he asked earnestly. ' Thou shalt have gold!' 'I can have gold from the Jew. Come after me. I can get thee out safe, if we are quick.' Shall we need disguises?  ' Yes; but you will find them in a moment,' answered the assassin. ' Come at once afterme!' They did not hesitate to obey. I He led them rapidly along a narrow entry, down a flight of stairs, and. o, into the dark passage by .which they had come from the Jew's clothing shop. On reaching it, the Jew, who was the crea- ture of 'Baltazar,'upon understanding their per- il, at once invested them with the black gowns and'cowls of monks, for his shelves furnished representatives from almost every grade and profession in society. Thus completely disguised, he led them from his shop, and first going up and down the street to see that no one was ob- serving, he dismissed them, under the guidaneI of the man Mozo, as he sometimes called him- self, though no one knew his true name. The   Jew told Enrique that he could trust to his guidance with safety. Mozo conducted them to the length of the street, and then up by the wall of the garden, which brought them in sight of the front of the palace of Don Baltazar. Here they beheld a large armed force just in the act of battering down the gate which there remained no one with. in to open to them. ' You see that I did not lie, and that II did not hurry you away too soon,' said Mozo, in a tone of exultation. 'We are under the greatest obligations to you,' answered Don Enrique, who trembled at the imminent peril that they had escaped; and encouraging the princess, they were in alfew moments up a cross street, beyond the glare of torches, and the uproar of voices. Mozo now drew near to them and said that they must walk half an hour before they would reach the place where he intended first to Stop. He went on before, and took the shadow of the city wall, until he came to the open esplanade, where the walls are levelled to form the Ala- meda. They traversed the long avenues of trees, past cool fountains, now and then passing a guard who would civilly accost the 'two priests,' and interchange a jest with Mozo, whom every one seemed- to know. At length they got outside of the city, land entered a road that led between gardens. At the distance of a mile from the walls, Mozo stopped before a sort of inn. Here he left them without and entered the yard; after a few min- utes he returned leading two horses saddled, and followed by the host, who wished the padres a good night, and hoped they would find the general better. Without a word at Mozo's hint they took sad- dlej and he upon a third horse went forward at a pace that set them an example of the rapid manner he deemed it expedient to travel. After six miles had been swiftly traversed in an easterly direction, Enrique inquired how he had obtained the horses. 'It is a courier's house for the governor's   post-horses. I told the man that you were two confessors who had been sent by the captain-gen- eral to confess the general of the army of the eastern potentate of Mondango who was dying; and that you must have fast horses And no de- lay. I enforced my order by slipping a piece , of gold into his hand.' 'Thou art an ingenious and faithful fellow,' said Enrique. 'We shall owe our lives and fortune to thy sagacity. Thou shalt not be un- rewarded when once we get to a place of safety.' ' And where will that be?' asked Mozo,dryly. 'Thou dost well ask that,' answered Don En- rique, sadly. ' How far is Cardenas?' 'It will take ten hours' good riding to reach there, senor.' ' And these horses will not bear the fatigue.' 'You can change at every relay.  These horses being post-horses, are security and gage for others at the next change.' ' That is true. I must try to reach Cardenas. The governor's brother there is my friend, and with him, Garcilaso,' he added, turning to the disguised princess, ' we can obtain shelter.' At the next post. which was fourteen miles from Havana, they changed horses, being/fur- nished with others without question. - In this manner they rode all night, and just at dawn they came irn sight of the sea and of the town of Cardenas. The first object that met their sight through the dim morning twilight was a steam vessel from which troops of armed men elad in red shirts were debarking and forming in warlike array. ' The invaders have landed I' cried Mozo. ' Hark to the firing-here is trouble l' 'What invaders? Not the republican party?' cried Don Enrique, reining up his foaming steed. ' No other. Huzza! How gallantly they rush up to the square. Hark to the cannon 1 I wouldn't have missed this fight for a bag of gold pesos.' 'There is no going into the town now,' said Don Enrique, as he baw battalion after battalion ,press forward and mingle in a general battle that now took place in the streets: below them. At the same moment a party of sixty or seventy of   the invaders, making a detour, passed the foot of the hill on a run in the direction of the rail- road station. ' That is to prevent news from being sent to Matanzas,' said Mozo. ' But I know a trick worth two of that. The general at Matanzaa will give me a thousand pesos for the news: so. good morning, senors I You can take care of yourselves now!' Before Don Enrique could ask him where he was going, he gave his horse the rein, and turn- ing back the way he had come, he galloped at full speed in the direction of Matanzas, where a large force of Spanish troops was quartered. In a few minutes he was out of sight. X Don Enrique was now thrown completely on his own resources, and he sat for a Jfew moments in his saddle deliberating what to do. The princess, pale and in silence, watched every ex- pression of his face. She felt that danger sur- rounded them, but so that she could share it by' the side of Don Enrique, it seemed to be les- sened. *Confidingly, as if he could protect her from all evil, she drew close to him and laid her hand upon his arm. The roar- of the conflict, still raged in the town, Companies of foot charged up street af- ter street, and at length they saw them gallantly attack the governor's palace. ' The town is no place for us, Mariana.' ' Where then can we go?' ' To remain in Cuba is impossible, with safety. 'All our hopes are defeated. I see no other way than to throw ourselves upon the pro- tection of these Anglo-Saxon warriors, and if they are victorious, we, shall be safe from our foes; and if they are compelled to retreat, we will go to their land with them, where we will be in safety until we return to Spain I' While they were thus speaking, a part of the f detachment which had marched towards the rail- -road depot, had surrounded them, and now came upon them unawares. It was commanded by Rinaldo. ' You are our prisoners, holy fathers,' said the t officer civilly, as he laid his hands 'upon the ' reins of one of the horses, while a subaltern  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7455-00000048"/> seized the other. ' We do n't gh with priestsi but we must prevent your riding off to give the alarm.' 'We have no intention, senor captain. We are merely spectators of the battle.' TYou will please dismount, as we may want your horses; when we have done with them they shall be returned to you.' Enrique and Mariana then gave up their horses, and EInrique taking the officer aside, said: 'We throw ourselves on your protection. We are enemies to the government.' ' Excellent I will escort'you to the head quarters after our brave General Lopez wins the palace, which he will make head quarters. He will need a padre or two in his suite.' The attack upon the governor's house now grew more and more,resolute; and Rinaldo see- ing that it was ably defended, and that his comrn rades were suffering, called his men to follow him, and dashed down the steep to join in the attack. Enrique and his companion were then left alone and on foot. While they were delib- erating what course to adopt for security, a squadron of lancers came in sight from the country, and soon passed them at fill charge, their lances in rest. Shortly after eame up a column of infantry from a neighboring garrison, the colonel of which seeing them on the hill, sent and had them brought to him and asked the force of the. enemy. ' About six hundred men,' answered Enrique. ' We will soon annihilate them,' answered the Spaniard, haughtily. ' Come with us, priests, to confess the dying; for we shall have hard fighting to beat off these .:Americans. I know' what they are, having fought against them in Mexico I Onward! March, '  he shouted to his column. ' Let us press forward!' Before he could resist or object to being taken along with the column, Enrique found himself and Mariana in the van of the attack; and in this manner he entered the streets of the town. By this time the palace was on fire, andc the bat- tle waged on all sides fiercely. In the heat of   charge he succeeded in withdrawing himself and the princess,from the front, and sought shelter in a house, the door of which chanced to be open. Here they found a bishop, who had been slightly wounded by a chance ball, lying on a settee. Upon seeing the two monks, as he supposed them to be, he asked them to draw near to him. What was Don Enrique's delight and surprise, on recognizing in him the noble ecclesiastic de Qasablanca, who was a strong partisan of his party, whom he had known in Spain, and to whom he had letters. There being in the room no others, Don Enrique at once made himself known to him; and then briefly told him how all' was lost; and that they were fugitives. Upon hearing this, after he had given ex- pression to his emotions of surprise and sorrow, be agreed with Don Enrique, that under present circumstances the conspiracy must be abandoned; and that his only safety lay in flight from the island. Don Enrique then suggested placing himself on board   the invaders' steam-vessel, which, he said, from present appearances, would be compelled to retire from the port. This pro- posal met with the bishop's approval, because it seemed the only hope left of escape. 'The town will soon be filled with troops, which will compel the Americans to evacuate it, and then every house will undergo strict search for foes and traitors.. It will be impossible but that you be discovered '      .  'But, holy father,' said Enrique with deep- ening color, ' with, the loss of the empire, let me not lose also my bride. According to the terms on which she was released from the convent, she must now return there! I must take her back, in all honor, to Spain, and at the threshold of the convent, we must be severed forever. Thou hast the power to assoilize us both from our vow. If thou wilt do it, I will bear the disappoint- ment in all els. With the possession of Marl- ana, I shall have an empire that 'kings might envy. Free us, holy father, anda our hearts will ever pray for thee, and our lips bless thee. We will then proceed to the States, and there, or in some other partt of the world, forget that we have lost a crown!   'Kneel, my children!' .  .. They both knelt by the side of his couch. He then laid his hands upon their bowed heads, and said impressively: . i ' In the name of the holy apostles and the Church which giyeth me the power to bind and to loose, I absolve thee both from thy vow 1 Be 'ye happy, and love one another 1' 'Now, holy father, one gift and blessing more!' said Enrique.- Here, -while we kneel side by side, unite us in the holy ties of wed- lock.' Here the bishop made an effort to rise to his elbow, when Theodore, who'had entered the room and witnessed the foregoing scene with surprise lighting up his fine countenance, sprung forward, saying: "et me assist thee, venerable sir!' All gazed upon him with surprise I They saw that he was armed, and blackened by the smoke of the battle which still roared without, but the tone of his Voice, and the gentle light of his eyes, gave them confidence in him. ' Let me aid thee, father! I have been but three weeks wedded, and I can sympathize with these dis- guised lovers ;' for as they had dropped their cowls for the bishop to place his hands on their heads, their faces were both revealed. The holy man then, in a strong voice, performed the marriage ceremony amid the roar of cannon, the shouts of combatants, the fusilade of musketry, and all the wild music of war. It was a happy moment to both, when En- rique pressed Dona Mariana to his heart his wedded wife! Theodore, though he knew them not, congratulated them; and as he saw them still in their -disguise, he asked if they feared the invaders, that they wore .these sacred robes.' 'No, senor, we fled from the power of the captain-general.' ' Then you are our friends. We will protect you I But I heard the retreat sounded. We shall have to give Cuba up this time.' ' We are not republicans, either,' answered Don Enrique; ' but if you will allow us the   shelter of your vessel, and to go with you in it if you retreat, you will save us from arrest.' 'I pledge to you both my protection,' an- swered Theodore. At this moment the retreating Saxons passed the door, and Theodore, who had entered the house in order to see if it could be garrisoned with effect to command the two side streets, went out, followed by the disguised lovers, who did not, however, quit the presence of the bish- op till they had pressed his cheek with their lips, and poured out their gratitude for the rich ' boon he had bestowed upon them. The issue of this daring attack upon Cuba-- an invasion only equalled by that of the Nor- mans on the Secilian Island some centuries ago, is matter of history. Overpowered by numbers that constantly poured into the town, they slow- ly and in good order withdrew to- their war- steamer, repelling with great slaughter charges of lancers and of infantry, and compelling their foes to respect their valor even in defeat. Don Enrique and his bride, still disguised, embarked with them; and with the retiring army, safely reached the shores of America, af- -ter one of the most thrilling and exciting ch'ases by the Spaniards that was ever recorded. Theodore dwells in-a charming chateau on the orange-bowered coast of Louisiana. The sharer of the mutual happiness of himself and the handsome Rebecca, 'is none otherlihan Don Baltazar himself, fully reconciled to them both. For when the captain-general found that the princess had escaped, and he was thus prevented from arresting the rich Israelite for actually be- ing their shelterer, he suffered Don Baltazar to depart after the payment of a sum so large that the Jew determined at once to leave the land governed by one who could thus use his power. And as Rebecca, after reaching New Orleans, had written him a letter, telling him the whole history of her love for Theodore, and how happy she now was as his bride, all save her father's forgiveness, which she humbly entreated him to grant her, he resolved to forget and forgive, and go and tell her so, and choose for the rest of his  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7455-00000049"/> '&amp;ys, the-' land of the' free, - and- 6th ' e "of the brave; for his 'hdme.
