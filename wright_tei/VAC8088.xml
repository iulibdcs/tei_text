FANCIES 4I              OP A J      WHMSICAL BAN NEW-YEAR' day again! Yes, another year is upon us, already. This blessed moment, are they gathering poor old 1851 to his fathers, while young '52 is popping his gracious little nose into the great Theatre of Tilme. And is it possible, that this busy ball of ours, has so soon rolled round to its starting-place in the hea- vens? Even so. And while I have been stating the fact, (in my own absurd way) in this homely re- cord, lo, another thousand leagues of air hath it left  behind it, in its ceaseless flight! What a voyage, to be sure! No stopping, here, for pilot or passenger, for freight or fuel; no tacking ship; no fighting with adverse gales; no bristling icebergs, to drive us from our course - but on, onforr- ever, whirling and spinning, spinning and whirlbig, even to the great crack of doom    &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC8088-00000004"/> 10      NEW-YEARnS DAY. Rather a monotonous business, though, isn't it? This perpetual describing of the same old. circle; this frightfully regular recurrence of daylight and darkness, of ebb and flow, of spring-time and harvest! Why could'nt things have been arranged a little dif- ferently? Why could'nt we have been indulged in an occasional Exploring Expedition- among our bro- ther and sister stars-? Why not have had the privi- lege of calling on our friends in Jupiter, or of visiting the magnificent ring and those seven charming moons of Saturn? Why could not our little craft have been allowed to come to anchor, now and then, alongside ,of the all-glorious Sun himself? There would have been novelty and excitement for us. We should have known something about the Universe, then. We should, at least, have been posted up in the affairs of our own System. But, as it is, confined continually to the same narrow, dreary, obscure round in the heavens, and, for aught we know, forever, it is posi- tively too bad., There's a sensible, grateful, Christian speech for you-the same old story-evermore grumbling-- evermore finding fault with God's arrangements!- Fie, man, for shame. If such unprofitable, wicked fancies will-keep rushing through your brain, do at least have the decency to keep them to yourself- why will you persist in talking and scribbling, after this absurd fashion?   NEW-YEARnS D AY.      " Well, well, poor old 1851 is in his grave-his good and evil doings are at an end-his glories and his griefs are over-he's off, gone, swallowed up in the "unrelenting Past." Peace to his ashes. He was a great fellow, in his way-he certainly did some wonderful things. That Crystal Palace of his, alone, ought to immortalize him. He completed many vast works, begun by his fathers-he planned many mag- nificent enterprises forhis children. How he did fling about the Gold Mste  be sure! What a mighty builder he was of RaiTRoads, and Steamers, and Telegraphs.  Yes, he was an honor to his cen- tury, as that century itself will be an honor to all recorded time-the century of Earth.  So will the-" future historian describe it, some two thousand years hence-the era, when more great exploits were achieved by sea and land, more elemental truths of all kinds discovered, more massive foundations laid of future greatness, than all its predecessors com- bined could boast of, from the first shinfng of the su.- Ah, dear, it was a mighty easy matter to keep the run of things, in the infancy of the planet. Adam had a quiet, delightful time of it in Eden, had he but known it-a pleasant, limited range of duties, and then, his day's work done, 'twas all wonder and wor- ship, 'calm contemplation and poetic ease'-and to crown all, the society of angels, ever at hand to an-  &#xD;<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC8088-00000005"/> 12       NEW-YEARS DAY.' swer all his questions, solve all his, doubts, to point out and explain to him all the sublime and beautiful things about him. He had no dull, dubious histories to plod through, no horrible mathematical labyrinths to explore, no' dreary details of Art or Science to master, no cant and- jargon of schools and crafts to bother him, no frightful tables of statistics to fatigue and bewilder him. No-he had but to ask, and it was answered-a prompt, clear, charming answer, direct from the great founAin of truth. How fares it with a poor fellow, How, in this crowded, bustling age of ours? How is he to get at the meaning of things? Now, when every hour has its multitude of complicated transactions; when every day fur- nishes materials for the pens of thousands of record- ing angels-; when the crowd of doers and of thinkers is continually increasing; the great Family Circle of Nations is constantly enlarging ; when new Repub- lics are springing up in all directions, new discoveries and contrivarices of all sorts, are perpetually show- ing themselves in all the walks of life? I ask again, how is a, poor fellow to get. along? How is he to keep up with this tremendous movement? How is he to know what to think, or what to do? How is he to separate the wheat from the chaff;- to find out and extract his own proper portion of truth and duty from thp great chaotic mass around him? How is   NEW-YEAR S DAY.        13 he to begin to solve, at all to his own satisfaction or comfort, the great Problem of Life? What, oh what doth it signify, this vast, this never-ceasing Pano- rama? Whither, oh whither tends this countless multitude of eager, restless souls? But these are no themes for me. We every-day fellows have no right to venture, with these tender lungs and flighty brains of ours, into such lofty re- gions of speculation. It will do well enough for your John Milton, or your Francis Bacon, or your Isaac Newton, to scale these dlzzy heights, and to look down, with calm, wise eye, from his airy tower of contemplation, on the mighty map beneath. They, perhaps, can fathom these depths ; can pluck out the heart of these mysteries ; can detect the great truths that underlie all this vast show and tumult; can comprehend, and in some measure, feel, the "central peace, subsisting at the heart of endless agitation." But we, igntes mninores, " the smaller sort of boys," poor, fluttering, feverish creatures of the passing hour, what business have we in these perilous high places? Down, ,man, to your proper post. -Why are you sitting here, using these big words, and in- dul:ging in these misty musings, when you ought to be up and out, discharging the social duties of the day?

Day of  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC8088-00000006"/> NEW-YEARWS DAY. the Heart! ever recognized, and honored throughout Christendom, but, above all, honored and celebrated in this beloved Gotham of ours. Delicious anniver- sary--Day of good wishes, good resolutions, good gifts, yea, of all manner of good things-r-wherein the crustiest old bachelor forgets his crustiness, the sour- est old maiden her sourness-when beauty is more victoriously, heart-breakingly beautiful than ever. Day of sweet smiles, and dainty kisses, and hearty hand-shakes, and boisterous salutations.-Day of bonbons and bouquets-Day of punch, and nogg, and bounce-of popping corks, and potted birds, and gar- nished cakes, and jelly-clad turkies-Day of triumph to the confectioner, of exultation to the pastry-cook. Great day of jingling sleigh-bells, bustling carriers, grinning waiters, romping youngsters, hail, all hail -and to one and all, from the darling little babe that yesterday sent forth its first cry of entrance on this strange world, to the dear old man, whose pil- grimage is so shortly to conclude in heaven, to all, a happy, happy New-Year!    DAY AFTER. Oh, Lord! am I the same man? Is that the same sun? How like the very old scratch I do feel, to be sure. Well, I deserve it all. I am but reap- ing what I sowed. I would have my frolic, revel, riot, and now I am paying for it. What a price!- Headache, nausea, confusion of brain, convulsion of stomach, and oh, far worse, mortification, shame, re- morse. How could I have been such an ass? How could I have yielded so disgracefully to temptation? What if    did mix the salad, and   brew the punch? The idea of wilfully immolating one's sovereign reason on such paltry altars as these! There is no excusing such conduct. Nay, to be so far gone, that I positively took that rascally, lying dial-plate on the City Hall, for the blessed moon her- self. Is it not outrageous? I am even accused of shaking hands with pumps, of bandying words with lamp-posts, of exchanging the compliments of the season with filthy swine, and, most abominable and atrocious of all, of actually mistaking our venerable colored cook Clarissa, for the lovely, charming . Of course, all my hopes in that quarter are at an end &#xD;<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC8088-00000007"/> 16        DAY AFTER. -ordinary follies might be passed over, but such a terrible blunder as that, can never, never be forgiven. A charming commencement, this, of the year!- Yes, every good resolution that I jumped out of bed with, yesterday morning, was broken, smashed to shivers,- long before the set of sun. So it was, last year-the same, the year before-ditto, the year be- fore-and so on, on, through the whole beautiful per- spective of the past-sinning and repenting, re-sin- ning and re-repenting-keeping it going, in this abominable battledore and shuttlecock fashion, ever since I became a rational, accountable creature. I can sneer and joke about it, too-can sleep soundly upon it-can master my three meals per diem, with as much ease and relish, as if I were a good Chris- tian. Well, I have begun the year badly, very badly. And it looks as if I meant to keep it up so-intend- ing, of course, to commence a glorious career, on the first of January, 1853. And in all probability, if I should be allowed to remain on the probationary side, till then, I shall be repeating the same contemptible old farce over. And so will the great majority of my friends and acquaintances--that thought, which- ought to make me all the more unhappy, positively seems to give me comfort. Oh,1fie, fie, fie! What'shWoul  bring into my head, just now, that   DAY AFTER.        17 strange, absurd, dying speech of poor ? Some would call it a very wicked, frightful one. Perhaps it was-it was certainly altogether unbecoming and unseasonable. And yet, there was a touch of the quizzical in it, that made a deep impression on me, at the time. Poor fellow, there he lay, pallid, ex- hausted ; evidently near his end--there were several of his friends about him. One of them, (from the very best and kindest of motives, no doubt, but, as I thought, quite injudiciously and vehemently,) began suddenly to press upon him the consolations of reli- gion. I shall never forget the queer look his face assumed, as he faintly replied, "No use, my dear 'boy, no use-you're wasting your powder-no chance for mne." He paused, and added, ," If there had been  fifty commandments, instead of ten, I should have broken 'em all--broken iem all-broken 'em all." The effect of such a  speech, at such a time, may readily be imagined. That hypocritical old scamp of a  doctor, to be sure, managed to keep his countenance; but there was uncontrollable snickering among the rest of us. 'Twas very wrong of us, no doubt. We ought to have shed bitter tears over a statement like this. Must he not, you ask, have been a hardened sinner, indeed, who, with the other world staring him in the face, could yet express himself in this abomin- able style?

He had got into such a habit of uttering whimsical, eccen- tric things, his -brain was. so crowded, too, with odd conceits and grotesque images, that it seemed as if they must come out, willy nilly, in season or out of season. Like Mercutio, he would have his joke, at all hazards ; would poke his fun, while the very grave was gaping for him. And even if it has fared as hard with him, in the other world, as he seemed to anticipate, I doubt whether there is any great change in him, in this particular. I can readily imagine him cracking jokes with old Nicholas himself, while in the very act of impaling and igniting him. Yes, mad wag, he- aied as he lived, and as died his great master before him. Were not his last words a re- quest to the doctors not to kill him? Did not the lamented Mathews, too, keep it up in the same style to the last? Did he not, a brief hour before his final exit, having swallowed by mistake a dose of ink, str ightway cry aloud for a quire of blotting paper? Queer things, indeed, these dying speeches! Quaint, pithy epitomes, wherein is often condensed the very essence of a long and busy life. Thus *, the in- deiftigable dancing master, exclaimed, (with a strong French accent) just before taking his final pas, "4The Jigis up."7 Thus ., the renowned cook, gave up the ghost, remarking, "I've got my gruel.') Thus,   DAY AFTER.  too, that famous and most eccentric manager bade adieu to life, with the odd expression, , I must quit the stage now, for my private box"-meaning, of course, his coffin. In the same spiri did poor old ,our coachman, say, just before surrendering the ribbons for good, "I shan't drive, the next ride I take." (The impression produced by this last speech was doubtless heightened by the fact of its having been uttered very abruptly, after a three hours' blank silence.) How many thousand anecdotes might be cited besides, in illustration of this curious point; too many of them, it is to be feared, the mere inventions of idle brains. The above are, of course, authentic. , our coachman, say, just before surrendering'** the ribbons for good, a I shan't drive, the next ride r  &#xD;<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC8088-00000009"/> THE' ILLUSTRIO  US CHitOPODIST. I WAs honored to-day with a visit from that illustrious Chiropodist, Herr Tszckrensbzschrocsky, from the University of Smolensk. There's a name for you! How it would look in a Spelling-Book! How it would sound, as announced in a Drawing- Room! What could a bailiff make out of it, in attempting to identify his victim? Could Fame herself hand it down to Posterity? Would it not inevitably stick in the mud, on the way? The bare sight of it is enough to give one a chill. Only look at those two poor little vowels, jammed and squeezed in amongst a score of blustering, bullying consonants. The ardent Tennessean, who expressed himself with such profane enthusiasm, at first sight of the letter A, how would he have aired his feelings, when con- fronted with such a combination as this? Is it any wonder, that a Russian is a linguist? The tran- sition from such a language to any other, must be like changing Purgatory for Paradise. Such a sound, too, as belongs to this jaw-cracker, in par- ticular! It would, indeed, have done honor to Babel, at the very acme of the confusion. If a few words   THE ILLUSTRIOUS CHROPODIST.    2f of Low-Dutch, skilfully discharged at the heads of the aborigines, set them scampering, with telegraph- like velocity, over the famous heights of Bergen, what would have been the effect of a hundred such specimens as the above, thrown in amongst them? Would they ever have stopped, till the broad Pacific hove in sight? Horrible as was the name, however, and- hirsute as was the aspect ot the Professor, his manner was as bland as summer breezes. He showed me his certificates. One stated, that he had cut the corns of his Serene Highness, the Grand'Duke of Saxe- Weimar; another, that he had decidedly benefitted the bunnions of His Majesty, the King of Bavaria; and (" the greatest is behind,") a third, that he had positively softened the callosities of the Great Auto- crat himself. Illustrious Artist! how condescending it is in him to venture his precious person upon the briny deep, and to come and operate on the understandings of us simple Democratic Republicans! But can the state- ments of these certificates be substantiated? Are they not arrant forgeries? and will not their author, after making a: successful swindling tour through the Union, return home with a similar batch of lies, relative to his operations on the toes of the Federal and State Executives, and of all the Military, Cleri-  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC8088-00000010"/> -22   THE ILLUSTRIOUS CHROPODIST. cal ;and Literary Nobilities of the lani. or, if unsuc- cessful, will he not go back and publish a crushing, annihilating book about us, and our institutions? But is it fair to pre-judge him thus? May he not be all that his card proclaims him? videlicet, "Ex- Tschitzikoff Professor of Corns, Bunnions, and Cal- losities, in the aforesaid University of Smolensk." There is nothing so improbable in it, after all. If dentists have been made baronets, and- have received Imperial portraits, encircled with diamonds, for the extraction of Imperial snags, why may not similar honors be awarded to the successful chiropodist? If Dental Surgeons have their Colleges and Diplo- mas, their Anniversary Discourses and Dinners, why may not Cornal Surgeons go and do likewise? No doubt, some grateful ,Russian did leave funds, in his will, for the endowment of this very Professor- ship, with appendant Scholarships; no doubt, this man has filled the post in question, to his own great honor, and the vast edification of the entire Univer- sity. Oh, how could I hate given him such an un- gracious reception, then? / How could I have shown him thb door so very un emoniously,' and in such unalloyed Saxon? By the way, Brother Wiggins laid a very interest- ing Report on this same subject of Corns, before the Whimsical Society, at our last meeting. I was much struck with the following passage :-   TE ILLUSTRIOUS CHROPODIS;      23 "In this Age of Progress, and of constantly multi- plying employments; when every Science is. daily split up finer and finer, when every Art is branching out continually into new departments, when every: article of merchandize, even, is rapidly becoming a specialite, (as ,the French call it,) would it not be strange, if the great subject of Cornal Surgery were not properly developed, and fairly represented, in the Community? We venture to say, that ere another ten years have rolled over us, it will be so represented-will have its Chair, and Lectures, and Text-Books, its appropriate exercises and hon- ors, in every University in the land, worthy of the name." "How striking a feature, indeed, in this miraculous age, is this ever-increasing sub-division of employ- ments! how emphatically true is it, in the world of Trade!

"How different was it, in the earlier stages of society! how very, very different were the social arrangements of the Patriarchal ages! Methusaleh was his own Chiropodist-ay, and his own dentist, aurist, oculist-his own barber, groom, porter, boot; black-'his -own butcher, baker, preserver, pickler- his own scribe, editor, publisher.  He had no Appletons and Putnams, to spread their literary treasures at his feet! no Beebes and Genins, to take the measure of his venerable brows!

Are they not all alike indispensable accompaniments to the great March'of Mind, neces- sary conditions of the great Law of Progress? Corns were certainly unknown 'a when first in woods the noble savage ran." They were. comparative strangers to the Nomadic state. They were, more- over, utter strangers to the blissful bowers of Para- dise. The rambles of our first parents in Eden, were not interfered with, nor their enjoyment marred, by any such intolerable nuisances as these. Had it been otherwise, surely our great poet would have taken appropriate notice of the fact, in his matchless Epic. Critics have often wondered, by the' way, that Locke has not done more justice to this part of his subject, in his great work on the -Human Un- derstanding. Still more amazed have they been, at Bunyan's absolute silence upon it, in his popular Pilgrim's Progress. It certainly is curious.  The theme has however been ably handled,: at last, by a young townsmanof our own, in a 'Greek Poem, delivered by him, at a recent College Commence- ment.

DR. BURTON delivered his celebrated Toodle Lec- ture again, last evening, at his old Head-Quarters, the Chamber-Street College. The crowds that it keeps drawing, are the best comment on this admi- rable discourse. This is the 335th time that he has delivered it, and "' the cry is still, they come." There was a jam, of course. There has been nothing like it, since the famous Caudle Course. It may be object- ed, perhaps, that this great effort is somewhat defi- cient in earnestness-that the tale is a little too much adorned, and the moral not quite sharply enough pointed.' It may be so. We certainly do laugh at, much more- than we weep over, the backsliding Timo- thy. And yet, Toodle cuts a very shabby, sorry figure.  The exhibition he makes of himself, is " piti- - viful, is wondrous pitiful,"--but oh, how funny, how irresistibly, how overwhelmingly funny!  Could Father Mathew himself have kept his countenance, had he seen him? nay, could a malefactor, within sight of the gallows-tree, have withheld a stray grin or two, had he met such a phenomenon on the roads -It is impossible to render any justice, by description,   TOODLE LECTURE.

TRANSACTIONS OF THE WHMSICAL SOCIETY. OUR Whimsical Club had its usual' semi-monthly meeting last night.

Mr. President, is such a reward as this, worth having? Is it worth the loss of good sound sleep, of quiet, deliberate meals, of the passing pleasures and excitements of the hour? I think not, sir. I am not prepared to pay any such price for a thing so dubious, so shadowy, as this.- You may think differently, sir, and act correspond- ingly. Your name may be preserved in the pages of history; your features survive in perdurable bronze. and marble; while my memory will melt away and be consumed, as fast and fearfully. as a pyramid of cocoanuts (not of Thebes) would melt and be con- sumed by a pack of greedy children.

And so he rattled on, till the hour arrived for the presentation of papers. Among other curious docu- ments, Mystifico read the following ;- being, as he re- marked, rather a free translation from a, Greek MS. recently discovered by him, while exploring the trea- sures of the famous Bibliotheca Jarvisiana. - Itseems to be a familiar letter from Eubulus of Athens to his friend Crito of Rhodes:  "MY DEAR FRIEND--- The good bark Argo leaves for Rhodes to- morrow. I send you by her the two hundred jars of oil as per order, and at the price agreed on, i. e. 75 (seventy-five) drachmas the jar.

And, indeed, all our other crops, as you will infer from the-rates in the annexed Price Current.

I would also ad- vise .you to hold on, by all means, to your Sparta 5's, and your Arcadia 6's. There are no sounder stocks in all Greece. And now, having despatched business, (and be hanged to it), Iwill indulge in a little small-talk about miscellaneous matters. 'Tis just two years ago yesterday, my dear fellow, since that glorious affair at Salamis.- What a day for Greece! We celebrated it in great style, I can tell you. Themis-- tocles wag in high feather; He gave a magnificent entertainment, on the occasion. All the wit and beauty of Athens were there. The absence of young Ci-mon, however, was a matter of general remark-- There is evidently a daily-increasing estrangement between the two. What a pity'! Xerxes, they say, has never got over the chagrin and, mortification of his .terrible defeat, but has taken furiously to drink- ing, in consequence.- How different a man was Mardonius! He would have given us a world of trouble, had he lived. - There was more sense in his little finger, than in ten such fellows as this fop and debauchee of a king . The Elections came off last week.

That, possibly, may be the spoiling of himn, but I think not. Aristides was, of course, on both tickets. The idea of voting against that great and good man, would indeed be monstrous. And yet, he is the same Aristides, whom we drove into exile, only three years ago, with that silly, cursed-Ostracism of ours! Absurd-practice!  Standing monument of the fickleness and ingratitude of Republics!. Butiit has not fared so hardly with him, as with most of our patriots; who have not been suffered to lay their bones even in their native soil; whose claims have only been recognised when the grave has swallowed them up forever! Themistocles, speaking the other day on this same subject of the world's mal-treat- ment' of its benefactors, expressed himself in his usual pointed way--- Yes, said he, ' we throw stones at them, while they are alive, and raise stones  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC8088-00000019"/> 40      WHMSICAL SOCIETY. to them, when'they are gone.' He is fond of making such pungent, antithetical remarks. I hope it will not be long before you pay us an- other visit. You will be surprised at the changes in our city. Our noble wall is finished, and fine houses are going up in all quarters. As to the Pirieus, you would hardly- know it, so crowded is it with magnifi- cent docks and warehouses. All this is owing to the untiring -exertions of Themistocles, who is really wearing himself out 'in the service of the public. To show,-by the way, that we Democrats are not al- ways so ungrateful as above stated, I must mention; that appropriations have been already made for the erection of two colossal statues in honor of our great Leader. One is to be at the Piraeus itself, and is to be decorated with appropriate naval ornaments. The otherj a grand equestrian figure, is to grace the cen- tre of the beautiful Theseus-Place. In the World of Art, there is nothing, save the  above, of special interest. Our artists congregate, as usual, at the Cafe Greco, but complain of want of employment. We have many promising young sculp- tors, but there is a decided scarcity of pictorial ta- ^ ^lent.

THAT old woman    5 has been here again to- day. The poor soul has got the notion into her head that we are all going to be burned up before the end of the month. She wonders how we can take things so coolly, and why we are not preparing for the ter- rible day. The old fool! And yet I can't help pity- ing her, for she is evidently quite distressed about the matter. I should like to see the charlatan, the scoundrel, who has been trifling with her weak nerves in this way. He ought to have his neck twisted off, or at least, to be locked up in Sing Sing. Burned up, indeed! Beautiful notion! What, just as we are beginning to find the world out; to know what its real boundaries, resources, capacities are; just as the school-master has fairly started on his travels, and the value of human souls is begin- ning to be felt! A pretty time to select for such a catastrophe, to be sure! There might have been some shadow of an excuse for such talk in the Dark Ages. But now, with such glorious revolutions ahead of us, with such wonderful developments in sight, both in the moral and physical world, the idea is too preposterous.

There are a great many magnificent things to be done on this earth of ours, ere the big bonfire you speak of, comes off; a great many forests to be levelled; a great many rivers to be put to use; a great manymillions of tons of iron and copper and coal, to be pressed into the service of industry; a great many spirited en- terprises and expeditions, by sea and land, to come off.

Why, then, talk of burning? Why, the world was never so well worth keeping as it is this blessed minute. Men were never so fit to be entrusted with its treasures.

Why, simply this. If seems that some publisher has just been sending him an old fool of a book-one Chrysippus on Logic. He says that it was one of the Herculanean Manuscripts, found some years ago, and unwound last year at the Muse- um at NapPes. It has since been translated into French, by a very learned and very needy ecclesias- tic, of the Two Sicilies, for the Paris Market. This, of course, is the:only copy that has been received in this country, and he, the aforesaid Tompkins, is the lucky fellow who has secured it. This was pretty much the substance of a pompous, two-hours' ha- rangue, full of wind, and conceit, and self-parade. The motive of the visit was palpable. Somebody's eyes must instantly be dazzled by this great trea- sure; somebody's heart must forthwith be made wretched at the thought of its belonging to another.

This, and the fact of my having listened politely to him, the other morning, while expatiating at length upon some Greek coins, were the reasons of the infernal old coxcomb's intrusion. And in this shabby way, have I been flung out of the perusal of that glorious speech of Kossuth, and been compelled to listen to the twaddle of this stupid Antiquity-monger-!

It is really nauseating to hear a fellow go on as he does! to hear a man deliberately priding himself upon his utter ignorance of all cotemporaneous mat- ters, while eternally poking and fiddling amongst the rubbish of antiquity. This very-individual, I have no doubt, could rattle over Homer's Catalogue of Ships, without a blunder; and yet, not a solitary question could he answer relative to the Navy, or Merchant Service of his own country. He could tell you the names and residences of the ten Sybils; but where the Mayor of his own city lives, or even his own family Physician, is a puzzler to him! He could give you the pronomens and cognomens of the whole fifty daughters of Danaus, and of the hus- bands whom they married, and murdered; (all in an evening, charming women that they were ;) but of the glorious men and women of our own Revolution, he is most profoundly, disgracefully ignorant. He can tell you all about Caesar's crossing the Rubicon, but Washington's crossing the Delaware, that criti- cal, that sublime event in our own history, his mouth is shut upon it. He would, no doubt, affect to prefer the shabbiest bit of fresco from Pompeii, to Leutze's magnificent picture in commemoration of it. Yes, this very man, who can be as flippant as you    TIE PEDANT.        49 please about Demosthenes and Cicero, had the im- pudence to tell me, without a blush, that he had never read a line of Websteris reply to Hayne. When one sees such folly as this, one is almost tempted to wish that Time had eaten up every morsel   i Df antiquity. "But no, not he. The old fellow is quite too much of an epicure for that. Catch him nibbling   i iway at such trash as Priscian's Catalogue of Stars, i- ror instance, (in two hundred dismal hexameters,) When he could fasten his tooth in one of Plutarch's Lives, or in a tragedy of Sophocles! No, indeed! Keep your Chrysippus, and the rest of your musty books, and coins, and relics, to yourself, then. Give me good old English, undefiled, for my reading; the current coin of the realm, for my money. To be     i sure, if you could show'me one of the identical pieces of silver with which Judas sealed his iniquity, I should feel differently-nay, I would freely give it my tears and reverence. Nor would I grudge a kind of veneration, even, to an oar, which blind tradition had assigned to the good craft Argo. No true chris- tian could gaze without emotion upon the one; no true merchant could look without enthusiasm upon the other. But when you try to pass off that molar upon me, as having once figured in the jaws of Api- cius, or when you undertake to tell me that that in- aisor once occupied a conspicuous position in the  &#xD;<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC8088-00000024"/> 50'       THE PEDANT S mouth of St. Jerome, then, I am simply disgusted. ; Nay, what signifies it, if that toe-bone did once be- long to St. Thomas, or if that bunnion was extracted from St. Bartholomew? What is there precious about such a relic, even if genuine? But I know that you are telling me a most unmitigated falsehood. Have I not myself, seen more teeth attributed to St. Peter, than would have been required for his accom- modation, if he had had as many heads as Hydra . And how much knowledge is there, of like worth- lessnes's! Who would care the toss of a copper to now, for instance, whether the Apple of Discord was more like a pippin or a greening; or what was the number of the glove that Helen of Troy wore; or which fist it was wherewith Achilles knocked the vile breath out of Thersites? And yet, how much time, breath, ink, temper have been expended by learned owls, upon points of no more value or signi- ficance. I repeat it then, that when one witnesses such perversions as these, one is almost disposed to wish that all classical learning had gone by the board. But no, no. Such a sentiment will never do, in the world. 'Tis alike ungrateful, and irreverent. What, deprive us, at one fell swoop, of all those golden maxims, those choice thonghts, those glorious sentiments of the great Masters of Old? That   \ THE PEDANT.        51 would be madness, indeed.

No, it would still have been keeping company with the Choctaw.-A fit exponent of the wants of savages. Unworthy of being committed to writing, it would have kept up a precarious existence, in the shape of monosyllabic gruntings, and hideous squealings. Nay, would not the world itself, but for this same classic lore, have been, at this moment, in all that makes life worth having, ver vevery little ahead of the standard of Madagascar? Let no man, then, have the presumption to sneer at, or cry down, things so precious. All I mean to say, is, that there are a great many pebbles mixed up with the pearls-a great many noisome weeds, as well as fragrant flowers; and that a simpleton like Tompkins, who can't tell them apart, is not fit to be trusted with such a collection. To a man of heart and sense, classical learning is, indeed, the great crowning ornament of education; the superb capital, aptly surmounting the massive column.

WIGGINS was showing me, this morning, a com- munication which he received last slummer, and which he ran against yesterday, while looking over some old papers. It speaks for itself:-  "Patchogue Phalanr, July 182 1851. DEAR SIR :. "Having heard, through my esteemed friend and brother-phalansterian, Dobbins, that your mind has become deeply interested, of late, in the great subject of Association, I beg leave to tender you my unfeigned congratulations thereon, and also to send you a Prospectus, with explanatory plates, of our Grand Social Experiment. at Patchogue. It is, indeed, refreshing to see-the leading intellects of our land, fairly awaking, at last, to the importance of this vast and vital topic. Candid reflection, we are sure, must result in a universal conviction of the necessity of a new order of things. A letter, Sir, is no place to go into arguments or details, upon aX theme so complex and multiform. I shall therefore &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC8088-00000026"/> 54    LETTER FROM PATCHOGUE. leave the accompanying documents to tell their own story. The appeal which they make to your own best interests, as a man, a citizen, and a stockholder, I consider irresistible. So much so, indeed, that I already look upon you, as one of us. No longer a deluded and defrauded Civilizee, but a happy, harmonious inmate of our Social Edifice. Allow me again, then, in the great names of Industrial Attrac- tion, and Passional Equilibrium, to congratulate you upon this delightful result. "Should you, however, be disposed to hang back awhile; should some latent particles of doubt still linger-in your mind, we stand ever ready, Sir, to shed light upon your reflections% We have it, Sir, in every variety; viva voce communications, jour- nals, pamphlets, serials, octavos, quartos, folios. Any statement that I can make personally, or any book or document that I can send you, is entirely at your service. You have only to address a line (post-paid, of course,) to ' THOMAS JONES, Ascend- ing Wing of Second Group of Tomato-Growers, Third Serie, Patchogue Phalanx,' and it will meet with prompt attention. , Welcome, welcome to Patchogue!" To this document, the following reply was sent. It is Wiggins all over.   "ETTER FROM PATCHOG'UE.      55 "SIR: "Your favor is received.

She wants to see what we have got for dinner, to-day. Hang her impertinent cu- riosity! It's always so. Not an omnibus, or doc- tor's gig, or baker's cart, can stop a second, before the door, without these eternal telescopic observations of hers! What a thirst for knowledge! I have a great mind to send her Phillips's "Mil- lion of Facts." I wonder whether she would take the hint. If she had the right sort of curiosity, she would be grateful for such a present. She'd find enough there, to stay her stomach, and to keep her away from that old look-out of her's, for the next twelvemonth.  But no, no, no-those are not the kind of facts she's after. Scientific researches, valu- able truths, relating either to the stars above her, or the flowers at her feet, are not in her line. But, whether Mrs. Smithers presented her lord with twins, or thrins, last week ; whether it was the Cruick- shankses, or the Sheepshankses, with whom the Jones- es intermarried; whether it was the third, or fourth foundling, that was left, last night, at Bachelor  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC8088-00000028"/> 68     IMPERTINENT CURIOSITY.

Couldn't some of the neighbors, now, be getting up a funeral, by way of accommodating her, and gratify- ing this liberal curiosity of her's? or a wedding? Any thing, for a change. And if it should so hap- pen, that the carriage containing the bridal party, should be capsized, and the happy pair well bespat- tered, or even a little bruised, why all the better. Such an occurrence would be a perfect bonne-bouche to the old hag. It would keep her tongue wagging for a fortnight to come. Yes, for all her affectations of sympathy, on the occasion, and her hypocritical smirks, the transaction would tickle her to the very soul.   IMPERTINENT CURIOSITY.      59 And yet, this hussy affects to be a highly religious character. She is one of the prominent lambs of Doctor   's flock. She, doubtless, considers her calling and election sure. She has a perfect-horror of heretics, and would no more be seen entering the fold, where   pours forth his fervent, heart-stir- ring eloquence, than she would be caught going into a policy-office. The old humbug! Precious religion, her's, that can thus co-exist with a life of utter frivolity, and backbiting, and fib-mongering! Why, if I were to send her over, that blessed old Bible yonder, this moment, the only article she'd read in it, with real interest, would be the Family Register. Oh, yes, she'd get by heart, the name and age of every mo- ther's son and daughter of us-the jade! She, an heir of the promises, indeed! What is there about such a shabby, worthless nature as her's, worth per- petuating? What good use can such a creature be put to, in any world?                 X But stop, stop, man. This is a very unsound, a very acid view of the subject. Y6u are, besides, illustrating the very failings that you are scolding about. What says Charity?

It is, /  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC8088-00000029"/> 60    IMPERTINENT CURIOSITY, as you say, pretty much given over to frivolities and fibs. But may there not be some specks of white, scattered about, even here? May not some casual words of kindness fall, even from that tongue? Were you yourself sick, in her house, this very day, might she not turn out a far better friend and nurse,  than you deserve? Besides, why rashy pronounce upon any man, woman, or thing, from mere present phenomena?  Is it wise, is it just? Who, that saw little Isaac Newton whimpering, and shrinking away into his mother's bosom, would have had the audacity to predict, that in that imbecile babe, lay hid the germ of the greatest of philosophers? Who, that saw Master William Howard, bawling and kicking in his cradle, and making a perfect little nuisance of himself, would have had the monstrous presumption to assert, that that bad child would be- come the very prince of benefactors? And, by the same rule, is it altogether absurd to suppose, that even the unpromising career of this old hag, as you so politely style her, may yet result in something glorious hereafter?" True, true. I stand corrected, rebuked. At the same time, I can't help having a kind of feeling, that the female in question will persist, to the close, in being an emphatic bore and nuisance to her neigh- bors. At her time of, life, decided changes of charac-   IMPERTINENT CURIOSITY.      61 ter are, indeed, rarissimae aves. And so, in spite of her own loud professions ; in spite of the counter- acting influences of good books, and good preaching, (to which last discipline, by the way, she hath cheter fully submitted, at the rate of three solid sermons per Sabbath, for the last half century ;) I believe, that she will persevere, unto the end, in poking that peaked nose of her's into the affairs of her brethren and sisters ; will play the part of meddler, backbiter, and circulator of small falsehoods, till the curtain falls. And yet, oh charity, I confess I ought to try to take your view oithis matter. There certainly is a sort of amiable plausibility in your statements.-- There is a possibility, (humanly speaking, perhaps, a very faint and naked possibility,) that this identical old scarecrow and bughear of Earth, may yet, at some very, very, very distant period of her career, become one of the most amiable and exemplary, and altogether delightful of the angels of Heaven. But the subject is an embarrassing, bewildering one. I had better drop it.

No, not a single gun have I heard, so far--not a solitary peal of bells. Not a bit of bunting have I seen waving to the breeze. Is it possible? There must be some mistake about this. You're a day too fast, certainly. To-morrow. Ah, no, no-the only mistake here, is in the peo- ple. See them, hurrying down to their business, just, the same as usual. The same bustling gait, the same earnest countenances. Yes, but then, they are saving up their enthusiasm for the evening. There will be a magnificent turn out then, surely; a glorious display, in the way of bells, bonfires, fireworks, illuminations. A superb torch-light procession, I dare say, with music, and banners, and garlands, and hymns of thanksgiving. Not a bit of it, not a bit of it, my dear friend. Barring the ordinary excitement of the town, we shall be as quiet as lambs, as mute as mice, upon this great occasion. It may possibly be otherwise. There may ,-- .

There doubtless will be a shabby transparency or two, hung out in front of some of the minor the- atres. A national play, perhaps, will be presented, in one or more of them; an affair, full of sound and fury, shockingly got up, infamously acted, before a peanut-munching audience; the Pater Patriae of the evening, three sheets in the wind, most likely. As to any other, or further recognition of the day, in this magnificent metropolis of ours, or in the-other cities of the land, I doubt it. A few old-fashioned country gentlemen, no doubt, will have the Farewell Address read in their families, and will render appropriate honors to his memory, at their tables. But as to any cordial, fervent, general Jubilee' throughout the Union, nothing, nothing of the sort. The more shame for the Republic! Would Greece or Rome have served her heroes in this shabby ma'n- ner? Had our great Patriot been a Venetian, or a Florentine, think you, his natal day would have passed by, thus unnoted and unhonored? No, in- deed! It would have been high Festa, with them. They would have crowned his statue with laurels.- They would have borne his picture, decked with gar- lands, in triumph, round their walls.

Why is it thus inaccessible, silent, crumbling to decay? And for more than half a century, has the hero been slumbering in this neg- lected spot! Shame) shame, shame upon us! Where are the monuments to Washington? One alone has ever reached its apex. Two others are struggling up, slowly and painfully, towards the heavens. There is a faint hope, that the designs of  the artists -will yet be realized in marble. All the rest are slumbering, ingloriously, at their very cor- ner-stones. There was a general hurrah at the time, it is true. There were meetings, speeches, commit- tees, subscription-lists. There were imposing cere- monies, and there was a great dinner eaten on the occasion; and there it ended. One fine morning funds, treasurers, enthusiasm, all walked off together, and have hot been heard of since.   WASHNGTONrS BIRTH-DAY.     65 Where are the statues of Washington? In all this broad, prosperous land, there are but three that are worthy of the name. And of these, only one, that is abroad, where it may be seen of men. A grand, a noble one, certainly; but where are the others? To think, that in this flourishing city of ours, rolling in wealth and luxury, where individuals have been known tQ give their thousand dollars for the ornaments of a supper-table, there should yet not be found a single statue, civil or military, in honor of the man, to whom all this prosperity is due; but for whose labors, New-York would have been, to-day, an obscure colonial town! Is it not outrageous? The Life of Washington. Is it ever read? Does it sell well? Are there not a- hundred inquiries for Jack Shepard, where there is one for it? Our youth can sit up all night, following in the footsteps of the Wandering Jew, or listening to the poisonous elo- quence of Eugene Aram; but they have no time to learn the events of our own Revolution. So with the Lives of the other Founders of the Republic, Jefferson, Hamilton, Jay, Wolcott; are they not all, notoriously bad speculations for their publishers?

There is, there is, in the midst of much apparent coldness, a deep-seated veneration for the great Father of our Liberties. Every hour is adding to its depth, and its intensity. Time will not fail to bring his appropriate tributes. This great day will yet be celebrated as it ought. Its advent will be greeted with the shouts of mil- lions; will send a thrill of joy through this mighty multitude, from ocean to ocean. New England, eldest in time, as nearest to the dawn, will begin the glad paean, whose inspiring strains will be borne- along, from town to town, from State to State, scal- ing the mountains, pervading the magnificent valleys of the West, till the last; joyous notes fade and melt away, as the last beams of evening fade and melt away in the Pacific.

AND SO poor Smith has left us, at last! His de-  [ parture was a quiet one. He will probably not be much missed-neither his person from our thronged  i streets, nor his name, if name it may be called, from the crowded pages of Doggett. There are still enough of them left, to bewilder bailiffs, and to puzzle-penny-  posts. The tailor, to be sure, of whom he purchased his quarterly suit, will be sorry to lose him; and i the hatter, from whom he got his semi-annual hat. A few other friends and admirers, of the same sort, dealers for cash, will perhaps, also give way to mo- mentary feelings of vexation. (Who can blame them therefor? It is a trying thing, to be flung out, even by death, of a regular customer.) But society at  A large, God bless it, will let him go, confirmed bache- lor-that he was, without a murmur.         ': By the way, Quizzico interrupted me, just now, with one of-his absurd questions. "If," said he,  ! "the soul of this same Smith be worth (as Dr. Chan- ning insists that it is,) more than the whole material universe, what is the proper expression of the value of Shakspeare's?"An inquiry quite as puzzling, -.   SMTHANA.         69 certainly, as it was unbecoming. I did not venture on a reply. Poor Smith! already, even in'his own block, for- gotten! There will be no mention made of him, this day next week, in any walk of life; no sugges- tions about a biography, certainly; no scuffle for his autograph. That pretty piece of penmanship can only interest his executors. There will be no anxiety to secure that florid portrait of his. Neither it, nor its original, nor its artist, will ever be the subject of angry discussion, in any college of antiquarians. 'To be sure, one of the aforesaid executors intimated to me, this day, an intention to palm off, if possible, said portrait, upon the keeper of a neighboring grog- gery, as a likeness of the illustrious O'Connell, and so secure a handsome offer for it. It is certainly not- the first time that the features of patriots have served as decoys to dram-drinkers. The idea is an ingenious one. It may succeed. There is a decided resemblance. But then, the mala fides of the trans- action. I should feel it my duty to expose it. Far, far better would it be for the community, that truth should triumph, than that the Smith estate should be fifty dollars richer, through any such piece of iniquity. Well, is it not all right, that Smith should be thus speedily overtaken by oblivion? Was he not essen-  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC8088-00000034"/> 70 S-MTHANA. tially, a common-place individual? one of the crowd? one of the least significant of the tax-payers of the metropolis? We might wish that it had been other- wise, indeed. But such are the decrees of Provi-    J dence. It is written in Fate's book, that one man should be a founder of empires, another, an opener of oysters; this, a high-churchman, the other, a low- comedian; one Scipio, a dealer in thrones, and ano- ther Scipio, a retailer of sand. Slumber sweetly, r then, O Smith, in thy hiding-place, undisturbed by  I Fame's impertinent trumpet. No gaudy mass of     ! marble shall lie heavy on thee, no abominable fibs shall be engraved over thee. No seven cities shall disgrace themselves, by squabbling for the honor of   having given thee birth. Thou iwilt neither have, like Homer, thy Smyrna, Rhodos, Colophon, Salamis, Chios, Argos, Athenae; nor, like the razor-strop man, thy Albany, Rye, Coxsackie, New-York, Troy, Lansinghurgh, Sawpitts.  More fortunate, perhaps, after all, art thou, in thy i obscurity, than-they in their renown! Inconsistent as it may appear, I yet cannot for-   : bear adding a few statements concerning the defunct. They are mostly of a negative character. In the first place, then, Mr. Smith was no scholar.   SMTHANA.        71 Of the "orbis veteribus notus," he hardly knew more than a Chickasaw. He was a wretched Geo- grapher, a miserable Historian. The backgammon- board he was so fond of playing on, it is true, was labelled, "History of England ;" and that was pretty much the sum and substance of his researches -in that direction. He was no man of Science. Of Physics, -he knew little or nothing; of Metaphysics, nothing; of Mathe- matics, less than nothing; of the value of property in the ward he lived in, considerable. His Astrono- my was of the meanest and most meagre character. Nothing but a blow between the eyes, could ever have made him a discoverer of new planets. The same, in Art. -Mr. Smith was more pleased with, and edified by, a wooden Indian, standing sen- tinel before a tobacconist's shop, altogether more so, than by the Apollo, or the Moses. Ditto, in Archi- tecture. Noah's Ark, with the animals going aboard, would have tickled him far more than St. Peter's itself. And as to pictures, he would deliberately walk by the "Voyage of Life," to gaze upon a fruit- piece. The portrait of a lobster impressed him far more than that of a lawgiver. Mr. Smith's taste in Music was not sound. The eccentric vocalization of a patent sweep, suited his ear far better than Benedetti's death-song in Lucia.  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC8088-00000035"/> 72        SMTHANA. I am- confident that he would have gone far more ntiles to have heard "Old Zip Coon," or "Jim along) Josey,9" than he would rods, to have listened to "Ah, non giunge," or "Qui la voce." Feeble, indeed, were the deceased's Literary per- ceptions and acquirements. Once in a while, he   a seemed to relish a savory passage in "Roderick . Random," or "Humphrey Clinker ;" but his daily mental food was advertisements. "Hamlet," and - "Lear," were as much Hebrew to Smith, as the original Pentateuch itself. The sight- of a current bank-note would have been far more of a cordial to his' orbs, than the MS. of the "Orlando Furioso,' or the "a Paradise Lost."  Of Mr. Smith's Theology, the less said the better. He was most abominably ignorant, both of Natural Religion and Revealed. He was almost an entire stranger to the evidences of his faith. He had little, indeed, either of the doctor, in his head, or the mar- tyr, in his heart. Alas, }e decidedly preferred pud- 1 ding to Polycarp, turtle to Tertullian, claret to either Clement! Of Mr. S.'s diversions generally, it may be said, briefly, and without disparagement, they were not those of Purley. Mr. Smith's heart did noot, like Wordsworth's,   SM1LTHANA.        73 -!" leap up, when he beheld The rainbow in the sky;" nor did he ever, with Coleridge, "refine the sense of beauty to an agony." Calipash and Calipee, as before stated, took a far stronger hold upon his feel- inos. Mr. S. made the usual European tour. I remember meeting him at the Vatican. It was his first visit, he said. He had been six weeks in town, and was to leave the next day. He did inot look interested. He did not go much beyond the Gallery . of Inscriptions, having an engagemnent, he said, to witness a grand slaughtering of hogs, that was to come off that afternoon, outside the Porta. del Popo- lo! Mr. S. spent three or four days on the Tiber, on a fishing excursion, but had no time for the trea- sures of the capitol. In this way, did he go through the Old World, racing through the galleries and antiquities, while lingering fondly over his dinners. I afterwards met him at Niagara. Hle spent part of a day there. That was quite enough for him. He did not say, in so many words, that he considered the affair (so he called the cataract,) a take in, but owned to great disappointment. So much for having too lofty an ideal i! Perhaps the most mysterious circumstance in Mr. Smith's career, was his taking the Baccalau- reate, as he did, at a neighboring college. How he  &#xD;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC8088-00000036"/> -74,       SMTHANA. ever got through, was, indeed, a wonder. He could no more have rendered into wholesome English, the liploma he received, than a young Caffrarian could. But he got it, and he paid a round fee for it, too. Possibly, this last fact may shed some light upon the transaction. The institution was said to be in a sinking way, financially, at the time. Ungenerous as the insinuation seems, there may be something in it. Colleges, as well as men, have their failings. ! Terrible are the temptations of poverty!  Decidedly the most marked personal peculiarity  ! of the deceased, was the sonorous, emphatic way, in which he blew :that handsome nose of his. Often,  i often has it been mistaken by strangers, for the horn of a passing melon-wagon; and, on one occasion, I have reason to know, that a poor, sick, nervous, wretched sinner, shudderingly took it for the last trump itself! It is but fair to add, that Mr. Smith had a respect- able seat in the saddle, and dissected a reasonably tender fowl, with a fair share of skill and coolness. When I add,'moreover, that he was an exemplary    ; member of-the 128th Regiment of the Un-uniformed Militia -of the State of New-York, my little tale is told.   AN ABSURD SCENE. WHAT a queer young genius, Quizzico's son, Epa- minondas, is! What other father, by the way, would have given a son such a name? Even at his tender years, he gives decided indications of the same quaint fancy, the same eccentric style of expressing himself, that so distinguish his gifted progenitor. The little scamp asked me, the very last time I saw him, with a roguish twinkle of the eye, if I supposed that Para- dise really went much ahead of Niblo's Garden? During the same visit, I had occasion to quote to his father, that passage from Scripture, "Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth;" the youngster instantly spoke up,-"That text don't apply to Sanders Nellis, for he does every thing with his toes!"He was -walking out with his mo- ther, the other day. They met a deformed man. The boy immediately asked,-"Mother, did God make that man I? "Certainly, my son; why do you ask?" "Why, if he did, I want to know why he don't find him, and fix him?"And to-day, he asked his father, if he supposed there were ever anyjokes cracked in Heaven? The reply was quite as absurd  &#xD;<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC8088-00000037"/> 76       AN ABSURD SCENE. as the question.: I shall never forget it, nor the ludicrous incident that interrupted it. Taking the lad upon his knee, at the same time that he gave me a most curious look out of the left eye, Quizzico forthwith assumed -a solemn cast of countenance, and said,-"-Your inquiry, Epaminondas, does credit alike to your young head, and heart: but, my boy, it is a terrible poser; for, in the first place, what ia Heayen? The good book goes so little into particu- lars upon this point, as thereby to leave a most ca- pacious play-ground for the imagination. With most of us, I fear, it is a mere addition and multiplication of the joys of earth; varying with the ever-varying ages, complexions, tempers, experiences, and charac- ters, of each and every mother's son of us. To your little brother Pelopidas, for instance, that entertain- ing young suckling, what can Heaven be to him, but the bosom of his mother? To the great majority of small boys, it is, doubtless, an endless round of top and marbles, an eternal hanging up of stockings, a perpetual firing off of crackers. And to most small girls, it seemeth to be, the sucking of indefinitely protracted sticks of molasses candy, the investigation of papers of peppermints, that know no end.  The -lover knoweth no other Heaven than the eyes of his mistress; and vice-versa. Nay, doth not Juliet ex- pressly call her Romeo, "a sweet Paradise of mortal   AN ABSURD SCENE.       " flesh?" (Here I thought Epaminondas looked a trifle mystified.) "The scholar's Heaven, what is it, but the thought of mastering all the provinces of the kingdom of knowledge; a triumphal progress through the vast encyclopaedia of learning? Alas, that death should seldom fail to overtake him, ere he hath de- scribed poor two or three degrees of the mighty circle! Bills, bonds, bullion, plate, jewels, coin, certificates, title-deeds, these things, as you well know, my boy, constitute the Heaven of the miser. Turtle, turbot, venison, tokay, foiegras, heidsick, are they not the Paradise of the epicure? Vatel, Vefour, Vry, Soyer, Delmonico, Downing, are they not the ministering angels therein? Keep quiet, my son, while I pro- ceed to open to you the respective heavens of the merchant and the soldier, the statesman and- the phi- losopher; and, above all, the seventh heaven of in- vention, of the poet." How long he would have rat- tled on, in this most absurd and inappropriate style, I know not. It was very evident, that the youthful Theban was fast becoming very fidgety; when sud- denly, loud, angry sounds "were heard, that forthwith took all our ears captive. There could be no mis- taking their character, or the- source from whence they came. They consisted of those inconceivably rapid and furious eombinations, that are the invari- able precursors of a desperate encounter of Tom-cats.  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC8088-00000038"/> 78      AN ABSURD- SfCENE. Epaminondas,- waiving all etiquette, rushed instantly to the window. We both followed. There, sure enough, in full view, upon a neighboring shed, stood the belligerents, their eyes like coals of fire, their backs aloft, ' their souls in arms, and eager for the fray.' They were soon at i. Long and loud was the combat. We were all greatly excited, and ex- hilarated by it. Indeed, I never saw a small boy enjoy any thing more thoroughly, than our young Boeotian did this melee. For myself, I confess that I wished, at the time, that I had had one-hundredth part of the genius of the author of "Hudibras." I should certainly have consigned the transaction to heroic verse, for the edification of posterity. In the very hey-day of the fight, a pail of water, suddenly, and most felicitously administered by a Quaker gen- tleman, from a window overhead, effectually amazed, and separated the combatants, who scampered post- haste, in opposite directions. I remained no longer, but snatching my hat, took a hasty leave of my friend, and rushed forthwith into the street, with a mind tossed by tumultuous and conflicting emotions.   THE   WHMSICULI. THE usual gathering of the Whimsiculi, last evening. The subject of discussion was, "Which is the greater blessing, Freedom of the Will, or Freedom of the Bowels?" Strange to say, though the theme was one, which came so directly-home to the business and bosoms of us all, the debate was decidedly languid and tedious. Scroggins opened it; as I thought, in a very literal, humdrum kind of a way, very different from his usual sprightliness. He wondered how sensible men could have two opinions about the'matter; he especially wondered at the se- lection of such a topic; saw neither propriety, nor profit, in discussing it; and went on, in this sopori- fic strain, for fifteen minutes; concluding, by declar- ing himself, most emphatically, for the libertas vo- luntatis. Wiggins, in reply, was by no means as felicitous as usual. He had no faith whatever, he said, in the first-named freedom, without the second. To him, the sana mens, unaccompanied by the sanum cor- pus, seemed the profoundest of humbugs; and how that corpus could be considered sanum, which was  &#xD;<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC8088-00000039"/> 80       THE WHMSICUL1. the victim of obstinate costiveness, was indeed a puzzler; and how that mens could long remain sana, which was compelled to keep company with such a contemptible corpus, was still more of a puz- zler. But he went even farther. He did'nt believe there was any such thing as Freedom of the Will. The idea was the mere offspring of vanity and igno- rance.  The more familiar we grew with the phe- nomena of life, the more thorough and abject would man's slavery to circumstances appear. He be- lieved that all the events of the Universe were ar- ranged from  the beginning; from the mightiest, to the meanest; from the crash of comets, down to the loves and feuds of summer-flies. In a word, he took, as it seemed to me, a very low and ultra-fatalistic view of the subject. He concluded, apologetically, by stating that he' had been so long deprived of the second-named Freedom, now under discussion, that he did not, candidly, consider himself competent, rightly to investigate or appreciate the first. Muggins, in the course of his remarks, wandered far and wide from the subject. In fact, his whole speech was nothing more than a vigorous onslaught on the Free-Soil movement. -He was pretty broad  as usual. Quizzico was  more calm  and clear-headed, I thought, than any  of his predecessors. His con-   i   THE WHMSICULI.        81 clusion. was with his usual mock solemnity of man- ner. "In a word, Mr. President," said he, " when I consider what a vale of tears life is ; what a web of mingled yarn, the experience of the happiest is; what a rough-and-tumble pilgrimage is the portion, even of the luckiest of us; I cannot, I think, over- estimate the importance of having right views upon the momentous subject before us. With these con- victions, Sir, when I turn my eyes upon myself; when I see the complete dependence of this proud spirit of mine upon the good will and pleasure of my brain; when I see what an abject vassal, that same brain is of my stomach; when I see, too, the utter inefficiency and worthlessness of that same stomach, without the auxiliary labor of the bowels ; I am con- strained, Sir, as an honest man, to admit that their freedom is the great, paramount Freedom of free- doms ; far, far, before tatof Speech, or of the Press, or of the City, or of the Seas, yea, or of the Will it- self. Without it, Patriotism and Philanthropy would be but idle words; all the Magna Chartas, and Bills of Rights, and Constitutions, and Declarations of Independence, that were ever framed, but so much worthless parchment.

Whereupon, the Chairman re- marked, that gratitude quite deprived him of his freedom upon this occasion. He had long been a sufferer, he said, in the way so feelingly-described by' his esteemed brother Wiggins; till one day, his lucky stars brought him in contact with that great and good man, Benjamin Brandreth. (Here follow- ed a glowing tribute to that benefactor, which was so full of fine feeling, and genuine eloquence, as to bring out three hearty cheers from all present.) "Convinced," said he, " by the Doctor's reasoning, and determined faithfully to carry out his plan of attack, I at last succeeded in conquering as unrea- sonable and obstinate a set of bowels, as were ever packed away in a human frame. I have been an- other man, ever since.  New hopes, new plans of action, new powers, new pleasures have dawned upon me.  Gratitude forbid then, that I should hesitate a moment, about giving my vote, as I now do most un- equivocally, for Bowel-freedom." In the absence of reports, and other documents, Mystifico read us a translation of another of those   THE WIIIMSiCUL.        83 curious Greek MSS., recently discovered by him. The following is a true copy thereof: "Protagoras of Athens, to Philippus of Chvero- nea, Greeting. MY DEARt FRIEND- The object of this epistle is to inform you that our Art-Union Drawing came off yesterday, in fine style, and that you, lucky dog, that you are, have carried off the Penelope. Yes, my dear fellow, the gem of the collection is yours; -a picture that Zeuxis himself might have been proud of. For the first time in my life, I have drawn a prize, also; a poor affair, though, being one of Protagoras's gaudy flow- er-pieces. I shall see to it, that your treasure is carefully packed, and properly directed. Should I ever chance to be present at the sacking of Chseronea, as an enemy, that would be the item of spoils which I should first pounce upon. But how can I jest about that, which, after all, is so far from being an impossibility? Ought I not rather to shudder at the thought, that we, who have been the dearest of friends, hitherto, may perhaps, within a little twelvemonth, be called into the field as open foes? Never, never, was the political world more full of tumult and uncertainty. I could almost curso the insanre ambition of Pericles, which, even  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC8088-00000041"/> 84      THE WHBISICULI. now, threatens to involve us, and all Greece, in a frightful civil war. Why can he not rest contented with his splendid reputation as a statesman, and an orator; the friend of peace and of letters; the' pa- tron of Art ; the companion of Philosophers? Why will he meddle in the quarrels of other states, and wilfully fan the flames of discord? At his time of life, too; when he ought to be making his peace with Heaven! I confess my mind is full of mis- givings. I see nothing but trouble ahead; and in the end, perhaps, the demolition of our glorious Com- monwealth! Hang the Corcyreans, say H! What is it to us, their family quarrel with Corinth? Why can't they settle their family jars among themselves, without lugging in all Peloponnesus, and all Greece, into the contest? In case of any such general melee, I can't help thinking, that you Beeotians will take up arms against us; and then-but I will not dwell upon contingencies so frightful. Jove spare us from any such issue! I saw Pericles to-day, walking on the Poecile. He looked haggard and careworn. Poor man, to add to his troubles, he has just lost three of his children, by that terrible pestilence, which has of late swept away so .many of our best and bravest citizens. One would suppose that this bereavement itself, would teach him lessons of peace and wisdom. But when   THE WHMSICULI.       85 would ambition ever listen to such teachings? What is there which your hardened statesman will not do, or sacrifice, in order to secure and extend his power? But a truce to these melancholy common-places. Prominent among the town-talk-topics of the day, are the mad pranks of that young scape-grace, Alci- biades. He is enough to ruin our Athenian youth. It was only last night, that he kicked up a most dis- graceful row at the Odeum; and that, too, while the chorus was chanting, in most superb style, one of Pindar's finest hymns! There is no excuse for such conduct. The only man in town for whom he seems to have the slightest respect, is Socrates ; and even he will soon give him up, I reckon, as a hopeless case. And yet he is such a handsome, spirited, fascinating young dog, that one can't; help liking him. We had a grand Regatta the other day, in which his clipper galley, Sappho, beat her competitors out of sight. What a frolic they had afterwards! How the Chian circulated! And how do you suppose the entertain- ments terminated? Why, sir, by actually painting out nearly all the faces of our Illustrissimi, in the Portico, and by knocking off the noses of half the nymphs and garden-gods in town! There's a pret- ty example for the Upper Ten to set! The scamp came out to-day, on the Ceramicus, with a magnifi- cent turn-out!

Finer steeds never kicked up their heels upon the plains of Thes- saly! And how beautifully he managed them! He was evidently, in all his glory. I confess, I don't wonder, that all the girls are in love with him. He did look like a young day god! Yes, he absolutely reminded me of that charming fresco of Parrhasius, which you admire so much, where Apollo is urging on his coursers, as they Beat up the light with their bright silver hoofs, And chase it through the sky. What a pity, though, that a young man, so full of wit and talent, should be' contented to be a mere horse-jockey, and quail-fighter!

Everything about him, looks, dress, gestures, gait, all proclaim the man of method, and propriety. No deck of man-of-war could be more trim, and orderly, than that same stately person of his, from his mirror-like boots, to his thoroughly brushed beaver; no figure-head in front of it, could wear a more grave and composed look, than that same countenance. His very legs seem to move with all the regularity of pendulums. How accu- rately he getteth over the gutters! How admirably he avoideth the puddles! Doth he meet an acquain- tance? What promptness, and precision, in his bow! Doth he accost a lady? With what unfailing felicity doth his hat describe its voyage through the air! It is indeed, a privilege to see him, preparing to taste that same air, on horseback. Such an in- spection of girths, and adjusting of stirrups, and ar-. ranging of bridles, and disposing of skirts! The preliminaries of a treaty of peace could not be more thoroughly investigated, and carefully settled.

The mere mixing of a Seidlitz Powder, with him., hath a certain dignity and formality about it. tIis very laugh seems to have all the regularity of a trill. The very bleeding of his nose seems methodical. The very tears that fall from him, seem to spatter less, and to resolve themselves into more uniform globules, than those of his brethren!

But why illustrate the point further? Wherever this man may be, whatever he may ,be doing, be it the carving of a duck, or the compiling of a code, he is the same unbending formalist, the same unmiti- gated precisian. I verily believe, that were it his fortune to-morrow, to be blown into the air from the deck of an explosive steamer, in company with a score or ,two of fellow-passengers, while tempting Providence on the great Father of Waters, he would both ascend and descend with a dignity and perpen- dicularity, peculiar to himself. Such a person hardly seems to be in his right place, in this young, rampant Democracy f ours. The solemnities and ceremonies of some stiff Spa- nish court, would suit him much better, than to be tossed and tumbled about, as I once saw him, at a tumultuous meeting of the masses, at the Old Tam- many Wigwam. He hath, ever since, most wisely avoided these latter gatherings. Perhaps it would be better for us if there were more of these old- fashioned fellows about. We youthful Republicans certainly are becoming a most disrespectful, irreve- rent set of dogs. Our mighty minds are marching altogether too fast for such encumbrances as ele- gance and etiquette.

And even as it is, is there not a frightful neglect, 'among us, of the little amenities of life; a furious disregard, alike of corns and compliments, in'this turbulent, dash-ahead generation? But is this man always so placid, and proper, and well-bred? Doth he never unbend? When alone, in the seclusion of his closet, or in the privacy of his bed, doth he not, occasionally, give way to a little hearty, genuine emotion? Doth not Nature assert her supremacy? Doth not the old Adam cry aloud within him, as within his brethren? Doth he never indulge in fretting, or scolding, or grunting, or bark- ing, or biting, like the rest of us poor sinners? Who shall say? I have certainly seen him, un- der very trying circumstances. I have seen him at seasons, when the eyes of critics have but a feeble restraining influence upon human conduct. I have noticed his behavior, when caught out in smart show- ers. I have seen him struggling with fearful gales, when his legs have been sadly put to it, to sustain him, and when his umbrella hath behaved most per- versely. I have seen him chasing his hat, square tafter square, with animation, with eagerness, it is true, but never without a certain decorum. I have seen him shamefully spattered by omnibuses, but never, never has he indulged in any of those volleys   THE PRECISIAN.       91 of oaths, or floods of Billingsgate, to which some of our best and ablest citizens have resorted, quite too freely, under similar provocations and annoyances. The receipt of pewter coins, even, and of counterfeit  notes, hath not been able to fright him from his pro- priety. Is it not fair to infer from these facts, that he is -ever the same? That, whether alone with Nature, or with history, or in the mere presence of relatives and domestics, he is the same tranquil, self-watching, balance-preserving individual, that he is to the great world without-. I think so. As to explaining these phenomena, far be it from a poor, erring brother, to undertake the task. Whe- ther it be that Nature hath denied him those tumul- tous passions, which keep the majority of mortals in perpetual hot water, or whether, beginning early in life, he hath, through constant drill and discipline, brought them to this complete subjection, is a ques- tion, which can only be satisfactorily determined by an inspection of the Heavenly records. Meanwhile, such are the phenomena which he invariably presenteth to his brethren. Nor can I conceive of any combination of circumstances which could make him appear otherwise. I am confident that had he lived in old Jewish times, and had it been his portion to have gone through the fiery fur- nace, with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, he  &#xD;<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC8088-00000045"/> 92       TH E PRECISIANo would have entered the said furnace, with the same quiet, well-bred air, the same scrupulous observance of propriety, with which he now enters, -and adjusts his person in, his opera-box. Or, had he figured, in a still earlier period of the world's history; had he been a poor, overtaken antediluvian, still, I do not believe, that his politeness would have forsaken him, amidst all the terrors of the scene. Yes, me- thinks I see him now, standing upon the last unsub- merged peak; left alone with one poor, forlorn female. Surrounded as he is, by tempests and whirlwinds, yet is he placid and courteous. He essayeth to speak words of comfort to the frantic creature beside him. He manfully struggleth to hold the poor remains of his umbrella, over her desolate head. With the wa- ter already above his knees, he still forgetteth not his social duties. Nay, so completely alive is he, to the requirements of good breeding, that, in the very depths of his despair, he faileth not to touch his hat deferentially, as he beholdeth the venerable form of the patriarch, at the window of the fast-re- i ceding Ark! Far be it from me, to cite these imaginary cases, in any spirit of mockery, or irreverence. They ,are merely intended, as extreme illustrations of the in- bred, ingrained courtesy and formality which ani- mate the conduct, and pervade- the conversation, of this paragon of politeness.

Toleration, truth, principle, the rights of man,i these are his darling themes. He will rattle away about them, by the hour. He will- pour forth his interminable common- places about them, with a fire and fury, that are marvellous to behold. How completely doth he stifle the voices of those about him, while vindicating the freedom of speech! In what a bigoted, persecuting spirit, doth he inveigh against bigots and persecu- tors! As you see those eyes flash, and fingers fly, and hear those syllables knocking against each other in his throat, you cannot avoid inly congratulating yourself, that Providence hath denied him any por- tion of that despotic sway, which he so vehemently denounceth! You feel as if it would hardly be safe to be a subject of his realm. You feel as if it would take but a slight provocation to make him a large dealer in chains, and racks, and faggots.

Could he have his way, every mo- ther's son of us, that wasn't bed-ridden, would be off, to-day, for the great battle-field, sword in hand, mus- ket on shoulder, to fight the glorious fight of free- dom. He is for keeping at it, tooth and nail, from dawn to dusk, till, as he expresses it, every hill-side of Europe shall echo back the shouts of redeemed, regenerated freemen. Did I not leave him, even now, blazing away upon the subject, in a style that would have put the most inveterate orator of a Cana- joharie, or Coxsackie Town-Meeting, to the blush ? Stop, stop, stop, man. Before committing your- self, too thoroughly, to this magnificent crusade, had'nt you better pause, and look about you ? Are there no great battles to be fought, no great victories to be won, that more nearly and dearly concern you ? Suppose you begin with that own heart of yours.- Are there no despots there, to be put down, or exter- minated ? Is there no pride, or vanity, or arrogance, or intolerance there, that is lording it over your peace? no iron will to be softened, no obstinate self- love to be subdued ?

There's a campaign, worth embarking in! There's a revolution, which it far more interests you, to have consummated, than that of Hungary!  And when, after patient, faithful struggling, you have carried the day, and all is peace and order within, then look at your own home. Are there no battles -to be fought .there? Is it not the great battle-field, where life's most precious victories are to be gained, or its most disastrous, saddest de- feats are to be suffered? Are there no infirmities there to be dealt with, no fatal appetites to be over- come, no angry passions to be appeased, no bleeding hearts to be comforted, no pillows to be smoothed by timely-words of kindness? Here is, indeed, an ample field before you, worthy of all your best thoughts and exertions. Here are glorious triumphs to be secured, precious reforms to be brought about. What right have we to make this sacred place, an arena for angry strife, or to degrade it into a mere office, or to bring it down to the level of a debating club? This is not the place to be perpetually dis- cussing principles in,; and reiterating trite truisms, and riding hobbies to death!

Soft words, and loving looks, and gentle motions, and cheering smiles, and genial tears, are not these things a hundred-fold more precious, than all the principles that were ever investigated by philosophers, all the maxims that were ever ham- mered into shape byr moralists? Dreary, barren things, indeed, are principles, unless animated by the affections! Leave them in the lecture-room, then; don't chill the fireside with them. Don't keep ringing the changes upon them, so vehemently and unseasonably. Dismiss a score or two of those hob- bies, also, on which you take the air, so furiously; or, if you must keep a-straddle of them, all day, dash- ing along, without any regard to your own life or limbs, or to the comfort or safety of others, do, at least, lock up the animals, at night. The drawing- room is not the plate for such beasts. When, by dint of your own assiduous efforts, aid- ed by the faithful co-operation of your kindred, you have, at last, metamorphosed your own household into a scene of love, and-peace, and sunshine, then go forth gallantly, and explore the-evils of your own- neighborhood.

When these conquests are effected, andyou have gathered in your laurels, and the blessings of your neighbors, suppose you then begin a magnificent as- sault on the Five Points. Rest not, till you have given this loathsome spot, a thorough ventilation and purification, physical and moral. Let your own town reap the benefit of your heroic exertions. And, oh, forget not the prior claims upon your heart, of your own dear native land. Merge not an ardent, efficient patriotism, in a vague and visionary philanthropy. e Do good at home, instead of wasting the day in de- claiming against evil, at the,other end of the earth. Put your strong shoulder to the great political wheel. Do all you can, to'. make your country that model nation,' which her flatterers are so ready to call her; in which appellation, her Vanity so readily ac- quiesces. When you have, at last, achieved all these splen- did victories in your owin heart, and household, and neighborhood, and city, and native land, then it will be high time to go forth, with your ardent brother- crusaders, and have a glorious encounter with that fiend, Nicholas, (as you pleasantly style him,) and all his imps; to crush beneath your righteous indig- nation, 'that young Nero of Austria, and all his bloody-minded satellites!   / ENTHUSIASM FOR HUNGARY.      99 Is it so strange, though, after all, that this man should be carried away with the great Magyar?

He wields them all, with consummate skill and power. He appeals, with the same irresistible effect, alike to our fears and our vanity, as to our nobler and loftier impulses. Earnest, fervent, bril- liant as he is, taking such strong hold, as he, does, even of the most sober-minded, is it at all wonderful, that your giddy enthusiasts are taken off their feet, in this wild, frantic dance, that they are leading? Will they not continue on in this turbulent, volcanic state, so long as the illustrious champion .keeps on this side of the water?

Yes, there will be peace and quiet, in those whirling brains of theirs, till the next sanguinary revolution is announced, by the next steamer. It may be in Paris, or it may be in Zan- zibar; all the same to them. Or, perhaps, their generous sympathies may be aroused, by the unwar- rantable, abominable interference of the Tahitians, with the time-honored, social institutions of the Tongatabouans!

But as to rushing forth, en masse, tumultuously, to the great battle-field, as some of these visionaries would have us, we are not going to make any such monstrous, and unexampled fools of ourselves.

We mean to strengthen the foundations, and to commence a worthy superstruc- ture, for our great/political system.

IN turning over some old- papers, just now, I stum- bled on' the following letter from my dear deceased friend,   . It is certainly very characteristic of him. - Naples, Jan. 19, 1849. MY DEAR BOY- Here I am, in this noisy, filthy, rascally town. Of all places in the. world, it is the very last, for such a nervous, irritable dog, as H am. What with the g:ttling of carriages, and the braying of donkeys, 'jie he bawling of fishmongers, and the screeching - 'of orange-venders, hang me, if I can find a moment's ,peace. To add to the confusion, Vesuvius has, all of a sudden, been taken very sick at the stomach, and threatens to- throw up, every minute. Such clouds of smoke, such frightful rumblings, must mean something. I wish I was out of the scrape. If there were any accommodations there, I'd be off for Poes- tum, instanter. '  I went to Pompeii yesterday, in the hope of secu "ring one quiet, meditative day, to myself, if possible. I was sadly disappointed. The place seemed to be'   "ETTER FROM NAPLES.      103 overrun with chattering Cockneys, to say nothing of a score or two of self-conscious fellow-countrymen. One of the last, actually had the impertinence to come- up and ask me, while quietly seated in the corridor of the glorious old amphitheatre, 'if the bay before us, did not forcibly recall to mind, that of Boston?' I replied, very tartly, 'No; but it is amazingly like that of Biscay, O.' The man'stared, whistled, and departed. To complete the nuisances of the trip, I was dogged all through the town, by a couple of dirty custodi, who eyed me as if I had been the veriest thief; and when Hlingered, for a moment, in one of the rooms, to make a little memo- randum of a fresco, that happened to catch my fancy, one of these same varlets growled at me most savage- ly, intimating, at the same time, in- very beastly French, that all such transactions were positively forbidden. The idea, that a man'can't be allowed to make a small sketch, or even memorandum, for his own gratification or convenience: There is an illiberality, a paltriness about it, perfectly in keeping with this meanest and most despicable of govern- ments! Of course, I went home to, my dinner, in a rascally frame of mind. Of all the ill-governed nations of the earth, this of the Two Sicilies, confessedly, caps the climax.

Why, an honest man is almost ashamed to venture abroad,'here. The lery moment you leave the door of your hotel, you are forthwith assailed by a gang of mingled .beggars, pimps, pick-pockets, print-venders, antiquity-mongers, and hack-drivers. This latter class are a sufficiently turbulent, unprin- cipled set, all over the globe; but those of Naples are pre-eminently infamous. The Father of Lies, himself, could hardly keep up with them. The same may be said of the pickpockets. Though invariably youths of the tenderest years, they yet manifest an assiduity, a devotion to their calling, that oaght to reap its appropriate reward, at the gallows, or the guillotine, at a very early period of their career. I was eased, this very morning, of one of my best cambric handkerchiefs, by a young operator of this description; and came very near losing the second, but fortunately pounced upon- the delinquent, flag- rante delicto. In the first tempest and whirlwind of my emotion, I was for giving the varlet a hearty dose of my cane; but he immediately entered upon a series of such indescribably sorrowful faces, and poured out such a flood of 'Perdoni, eccellelnzas,' that I was fain to let him go, with a benediction and a solitary kick. Ah dear, if that same bright-eyed,   "EITER FROM NAPLESP      105 young scamp, had been an American, now! His parents, I am sure, never would -have allowed him to go about the streets, in this half-naked, disgraceful style. Oh, no! he'd have been over his books, this blessed minute, at the Public School, picking up les- sons of thrift, and. wisdom, and virtue, that would have almost ensured a useful citizen to the commu- munity; possibly, a President. What future awaits this poor lad, now? Rags, scoundrelism; and, pro- bably, a violent death I Oh, Lord! it makes one shudder, to think of these things!

Gracious Majesty! Why, a coarser, more vulgar- looking wretch, never'figured in a prize-fight. He makes good butter, though; capital butter! As to his segars, tough customers though they be, they are yet far more respectable than their manufacturer! These two branches of business, doth this mighty monarch monopolize. He likewise bags more than half a million of ducats, per annum, by catering to the gambling propensities of his victims; subjects, I should say. Precious qualifications and employments, these, for a king! The infernal brute!

But the day of retribution will come. I shouldn't be surprised, any fine morning, to see this low-lived tyrant kicked from his throne, by an infuriated j populace; and if he should escape with his worth- less life, he will be lucky. Even these degraded creatures can't stand every thing. It maylmy nervous irritability, that is to blame, but it seems to me, that the manners of this people , are about as bad as their morals. I went into a shop in the- Toledo, yesterday, to make a few pur- chases; anrid upon venturing to air my wishes, in I'lijan, the insolent whelp of a shop-keeper laughed in my face! To be sure, Jones,- who was with me, also regaled himself with a hearty guffaw. Hang the fellow! my Italian is perfectly charming, along- side of his French! Ah! the more I think of it, the more' convinced am I, that this same gift of tongues, is the rarest amongst mortals.

The once gay and prosperous Milan, has degenerated into a cheer- less barrack. Venice; it makes your heart bleed to behold her, as she is crumbling, inch by inch, into the ocean.- Florence, that used to be so sprightly, is gloomy as the grave. Her sovereign, once so beloved by his people, is now received with cold looks, and sullen silence.

This town, it is true, is full of bustle; but, as I said before, it is the bustle of beggars and blackguards. And so of the other cities. Bologna, once so famous as the Alma- Mater of sages, and the nurse of arts, will soon have .nothing left, to brag of, but her sausages. Padua, that other time-honored seat of learning, now, just manages to keep her head above water, by doing a small silk and ribbon business. The energies of Ferrara seem entirely expended, in roast- ing chestnuts, and boiling cabbages. Cabbage, cabbage, cabbage. Go where you will, in Italy, there is no dodging the odor thereof. This, and thins sour wine, constitute the'main nutriment of this unhappy people. A good, hearty, generous dinner of meat, is, indeed, a stomach-astonisher, among them! Precious materials to make heroes out of! What can you expect front such a nation? Their very virtues have nothing manly or robust about them. They are only fit to minister in hos- pitals,-or to lie perdu in convents. They dare not come forth into the air, and play their part in the business of life.

Yes, the identical lineal descendant of the illustrious fish- erman. To say truth, the interview was inot pro- ductive of great results. He was, to be sure, a fine, handsome fellow, of some five and forty, with a noble set of teeth, a brilliant, black eye in his head, and a finely developed pair of legs, the feet whereof had evidently, from their first start in life, been entire strangers to shoes and stockings. But then, he was /n   "ETTER FROM'NAPLES. so frightfully ignorant of our constitution, and laws, and history! When I spoke to him of Patrick Henrv, and John Hancock; and Elbridge Gerry, and Daniel Webster, and Henry Clay, he had a painfully emba- rassed anld bewildered look. Not even the name of Washington seemed to convey any idea to his benight- ed mind. But when I alluded to the oysters of Fu- saro, and to the soles, flounders, and other occupants of the sparkling bay before us, ah, then how his eyes lighted up, and those of Mrs. M., and of all the lit- tle M.'s, some dozen of whom had come romping into the room, to see the stranger. Most of these same urchins, by the way, were frightfully near a state of nature. On the whole, the affair was a decided hum- bug; all, save the closing scene, when I tendered him a half-ducat, on condition that he would favor me. with a real, old-fashioned Barcarole.

How wrathy the old fellow did get! At the same time, I thought there was a queer expression about his mouth, while perusing it. There was, manifestly, a mighty effort to keep his countenance, as he handed it to'me. Can there, can there be any justification of con-  luct so abominable?

Or, perhaps, he was merely relieving that young brain of his of a crowd of whimsical images, which was oppressing it; a sort of gaol delivery of jokes. It is more charitable to think so. He is, indeed, the son of his father. Wiggins himself is one of the most eccentric, and fanciful of mortals. His expres- sions are invariably quaint and peculiar; and too often, (at least, according to a strict Presbyterian view of things,) highly, highly reprehensible.

"In this connexion, gentlemen, I am proud to al- lude to an event, which has recently occurred among us, and which has produced a profound impression in our community, and, indeed, throughout our Repub- lic.

Whether we contemplate this superb scene, as artists, or men of science, as moralists, or as christians, we are proud to render it our profoundest homage; we are proud to belong to the age, and the land, of which it is the crowning honor! And, gentlemen, was not just such an event need- ed amongst us T Was not the public mind, at the period of its occurrence, in great danger of becoming altogether too spiritual? of turning too deaf an ear to the--legitimate calls of flesh and blood; of quite neglecting material, in the mad chase after moral in- terests? Were not the insidious precepts and doc- trines of Chalmers, and Channing, and Cheverus, and   ,   CALLITHUMPIAN ADDRESS.     119 Fenelon, and Oberlin, and Swedenborg, and such like visionaries, leading us frightfully astray from the more legitimate duties and pleasures of life? I can- not help thinking so. I cannot but feel, that this tendency to super-spirituality, which has ever been the besetting sin of humanity, was painfully conspi- cuous about the time when this great incident in our annals transpired. An incident, which I must hail as full of good omens; an incident which cannot fail of bringing about a most wholesome, re-acting influ- ence in favor of the realities, and substantialities of every-day life. And now, gentlemen, allow me to ask, how is it, that the noble science of pugilism has been so shame- fully neglected among us? Why are- we, as a city, so far behind the neighboring city-of-brotherly-love, in this regard-? Why are we not encouraging a taste for it among -the rising generation? Why does it not form a part of our otherwise admirable Common School System . Why is it so neglected in our pri- vate Seminaries, and Colleges? Why does it not en- ter, more frequently, into the exercises of our Com- mencements? Why do not the Faculty set a good example in this matter, and by giving occasional exhibitions among themselves, thus promote a gene- rous emulation among the students? But, above all, why is not this beautiful science  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC8088-00000059"/> t2Q    CALLITHUMPIAN ADDRESS. called in, more freely and frequently, to relieve and embellish the labors of our Legislators? Why, gen- tlemen, there were actually, only three or four of thiese. interviews between the members, during the last long session, in the House of Representatives! and only one, of the- same sort, was got up for the amusement and, edification of the Senate. And in the Supreme Court of the Republic, there has not been a solitary entertainment of this nature, from its first organization. This should not be. We all know how the venerable Ch. J. Marshall felt upon this matter. Here are his own words, as cited in Micawher vs. Copperfield, 4 Peters, 287. 'I have ever thought, that the dry arguments, alike of law- yers and lawgivers, ought occasionally to be relieved by athletic exercises, and muscular demonstrations,. of the character described by the counsel for the plaintiff. In this way alone, can we hope to render palpable, and attractive to the junior members of the profession, its more abstruse and technical portions.' One more question, gentlemen, and I will take leave of this subject. How is it that Art has been so criminally negligent in illustrating and immor- taliing the labors of pugilists? It was not so in olden times. The Gods themselves, often conde- scended to figure as champions of the ring; and the proudest sculptors in the land, were delighted to put   CALLITHUMPIAN ADDRESS.     121 their labors into marble. Have not Phidias and Praxetiles themselves, thus eternized the feats of Castor and Pollux? And even in our own times, has not the mighty genius of Canova been employed in consecrating similar exploits? Why, not follow examples so glorious? Why not render appropriate honors, with pen, and pencil, and chisel, even now, to the distinguished champions, whose praises are in all mouths; whose yet swollen heads are shaded with well-earned laurels; who have reflected so much honor, themselves, alike upon their country, and humanity! It is in vain, alas, that we could appeal to Con- gress, upon any subject of this nature. Otherwise, it might be suggested, that the- statues of these illustrious combatants would be, at the same time, most becoming ornaments to the eastern wing of the capitol, and most appropriate vis-a-vis to the majestic figure of Washington. But why will not the good people of Baltimore take up the matter, in good earnest; especially, as their city was the nearest to the ever-memorable scene of action? Why not subscribe forthwith, and send commissions to Powers and Greenough, for two colossal portraits of the heroes; to be placed, when finished, upon each side of that stately shaft, which is prowned by the great Pater Patrice?  &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC8088-00000060"/> 122    CALLITHUMPIAN ADDRESS. that more touching tribute to worth, could be de- vised; what- more apt and felicitous position- be selected? Here would be a noble example to set i the nation, as well as an invaluable addition to the manifold external attractions of the superb City of Monuments." The same tone of solemn irony pervades the whole discourse; painfully so, indeed. One cannot help feeling, that the author was more under the influence of a mocking, Mephistophelian spirit, than of a sincere and hearty hatred of vice and brutality. Mystifico is quite too fond of the satirical and sar- castic style. -It has often earned him the appella- tions of cynic, and misanthrope; whereas, a warm- er, better heart, ne'er beat in'human bosom. The discourse was exceedingly well received, however, by the distinguished Society, before whom it was pronounced; and they unanimously insisted on its publication. m    FRENZY OF THE ELDER WIGGINS. I CALLED on Wiggins to-day. I found him in a frightfully inflammatory state. He didn't con- descend to reply to my salutation, but kept storm- ing and fuming about his library, in the most sa- vage and absurd manner imaginable. So I quietly slipped into a chair, and watched the progress of the gale. "The scoundrel-the blackguard-the vagabond! To think, that I should have been forestalled by such a low-lived wretch! Such an infernal looking villain, too! If he isn't one of the biggest scamps afloat, then is Satan no penman. What wouldn't such a rascal do? Why, Fieschi himself was a handsome, pleasant-looking fellow, alongside of him; and his infernal machine, a mere joke, to the enormities this man is capable of. He'd dissect his own father, the scoundrel! subject his own mother's tears to chemical analysis; play poker in a pulpit; throw  red-hot pennies to beggars; strew broken glass before school-houses, and then grin, to see the poor little children's feet bleeding; pull the last rose  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC8088-00000061"/> -124  FRENZY OF THE ELDER WIGGINS. of summer itself, to pieces, just because it was the last rose of summer. The vitriol-thrower-the fish- pond poisoner-the church-firer-the robin red-breast murderer! The idea of having to live with such a villain! It's bad enough to be in the same universe with him. The idea of circumnavigating the planet, in such company! Why, I couldn't even go to Brooklyn, in the same boat, without a collision. I couldn't sit in the same omnibus, without its end- ing in a most sanguinary scuffle! Talk about the sun's not going down upon one's wrath! Poh  I'd see a whole heaven full of suns rise} and set, and rise again, before I'd keep the peace, with such an atrocious blackguard. Ugh- I could shake my fist at his very corpse. I could bequeath a quarrel with him, to my children, and children's, children. It would be a comfort to me, now, to know that, ages hence, my lineal descend- ants will be waging war with his lineal descendants, about this very business! Curse him! --I could knock ten. sets of teeth down his throat, with a relish., I could throw things at him, through his very prison-bars. I could give nine cheers, at his execution. I could  " But here Wiggins's breath forsook him, I took. advantage of the lull, to inquire into the origin and   FRENZY OF THE ELDER WIGGINS.   125 meaning of this most extraordinary, most abomi- nable outhurst. Whlat was the matter, then? Had some scoun- drel been forging his name, to a large amount? No. Had some blackguard been insulting his wife, or daughters? No. Had some brute of a school- master been abusing his boys?   Nothing of the sort. Had he been served as the unprincipled Tomp- kins had served his bail? Was that the occasion of this frightfully strong language? No. Of course, it was no successful rival in some love affair, that he was thus bespattering. No, indeed. W. is a man of altogether too much principle, to indulge in any such forbidden luxuryy, as bigamy. He is an exemplary husband, a respectable house- holder; and his home is (barring  an occasional volcanic manifestation, like the above,) a tranquil, happy one. What was it, then? Had his corns been trod on? Had his newspaper been stolen? Had his tailor, for the ten thousandth timne, lied unto him? Or had he been the recipient of suspicious, or erro- neous change? Surely, such comparative trifles as these, could no more explain, than they could justify, such filrious behavior. Alas, the true cause was not much more signifi- cant. It was simply this. It seems that Wiggins  &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC8088-00000062"/> 126  FRENZY OF THE ELDER WIGGINS. had set his heart on- going, with his daughters, to Jenny Lind's Grand Valedictory Concert. Enthu- siastic admirer that he is, he was anxious to catch the, last notes of the glorious warbler, before her final flight to her native groves. Full of this feel- ing, he had, hurried down his breakfast, hastened to the box-office, and on examining the plan, he discovered, to his great joy, that there were half-a- dozen most choice seats, yet unsecured. 'Twas the very number he wanted. His mind was made up, instanter. He was on the very point of taking them, when his ever-present evil genius prompted him to turn aside, to indulge ihis nose with a most unseasonable sneeze. This movement sealed his doom. The individual next him, (thatis to say, the identical individual, whom W. was so anathe-- matizing, when I entered his room,) quietly slipped in, and secured the places in question. And now, there were none left, save a very few, distant, and secluded ones, in the gallery. It was rather hard, to be flung out of one's chance, in such a provoking, and withal, most absurd style. How the box- keeper must have enjoyed it! Not so, Wiggins. He confesses, that he behaved abusive, and came very near getting into a disgraceful scuffle. He went down to his office, but could not attend to his business. So he returned home, some three hours   FRENZY OF THE ELDER WIGGINS.   127 earlier than usual; somewhat relieved by fresh air, and rapid walking; still, in a decidedly tumultuous frame of mind, when 'he entered his library. It took all the genius of Irving, to tranquillize him. Fortunately, a volume of the 1"Tales of a Traveler" was lying upon the table. He took it up, and had soon .forgotten his troubles, in its delicious pages, when that same evil genius of his, again prompted him to step to the window, for a moment. Who should be going by, at that very juncture, but the identical intruder, who had so shamefully supplant- ed him at the box-office; lounging along, in the most cool, nonchalant style conceivable, behind a segar! This was too much.  Certainly, too much for a creature, constituted like Wiggins. It threw 'him, forthwith, into that " fine frenzy," the latter portion of which, with all its wealth of language, and its redundancy of gesture, it was my lot to witness. Such is an unvarnished statement of the whole affair. Comment seems superfluous.  The trans- action speaks volumes, nay, libraries, for itself. Poor Wiggins!   But I will not dwell upon a theme so painful.  &#xD;<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC8088-00000063"/> TRUISMS ABOU T     TRUTH. I have been favored, this morning, with another of ---'s long-winded harangues.  His theme was, the value and importance of Truth. Yes, a good half-hour's dose was I compelled to take of it, and be hanged to him! Had the man really said any thing new, or pro- found, or even striking, it wouldn't have been so bad. Or had he arranged his thoughts, with any thing like logical method, or used language with becoming accuracy, I could have forgiven him this invasion of my time. But to wander all over crea- tion, in the way he did, to repeat over and over again the same interminable truisms, to enforce his point by the same old hackneyed, vulgar illustra- tions, and to do all this, in the gagisterial, oracular tone of a great teacher, it is really too outrageous. It all but justifies the throwing of boot-jacks. As if we didn't all know, that we ought to prefer truth to pleasure, or indolence, or wealth, or vanity! As if the trouble did not consist, a hundred fold less, in these heads, than in these wayward, wicked hearts of ours!   TRUISMS ABOUT TRUTH,     129 But even our understandings may not always be e-  so amazingly well posted up, on this same subject i   of Truth, as this Sir Oracle, evidently, considers his. What is this same Truth? Who hath it?- How are we to know, that we have got hold of the genuine article? Are we to take for granted, this same proser's whims and notions, and swallow them down, without word or wink; or are we pa- tiently, faithfully, honestly, to explore matters for ourselves? Truth, indeed! Why, it was only yesterday, that I met half-a-dozen friends, coming from as many .different churches. Did not each one of them stop me, to express his enthusiastic --admiration of the sermon he had just heard, and his profound regret, that I had not been one of the favored listen- ers?"No such discourse," (so said every mother's son of them,) , has been heard in town, this day." Pray, where was the truth, on this occasion? Was any one of these warm admirers, altogether right in the matter, and the rest, altogether wrong? Or was there some foundation for all their eulogies? Is it so easy a thing, then, to lay our fingers on this so much vaunted Truth? Is it to be picked up, for the mere stooping? Is it a thing, that every shallow, conceited, domineering creature, that comes i  along, may lay claim to, and lecture about. as if it  &#xD;<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC8088-00000064"/> 130    TRUISMS ABOUT TRUTH. were some mineralogical specimen, forsooth, which he was holding up to his audience; or is it a hard matter, indeed, which is to cost us a world of pon- dering, and studying, and struggling, and digging, and diving, and exploring, to get at  And how many men are there, who are fit to go on any such grand exploring expeditio ; who have muscle and nerve enough, heart and soul enough; who can combine patience, and good temper, and judgment, with an ardent. intrepid, self-sacrificing nature? Once in a century, perhaps, some such glorious fellow heaves in sight, laden with his pre- cious spoils. He has worked and fought hard enough for them, Heaven knows; and here the treasures are. Rare things,-indeed! Invaluable secrets, in art and in science, in faith and in morals! But what sort of a reception do they meet with? Those that chime in with our fancies, or minister unto our appetites, are, of course, sure of a holiday greeting. But those others, which, priceless though they be, are yet, unpalatable to our interests or prejudices, at the tables of how many men, are they welcome guests? This same individual, who was singing the praises of Truth, so lustily, to me, this morning, is he at all pleased with doctrines, that rnn counter to his own? Or- is he downright anlgry;, if every friend   TRUISMS ABOUT TRUTH.     131 he meets with, does not promptly echo his own opinions; does not, forthwith, jump ulp behind him, on his kicking, spattering hobby, and dash on head- long, to victory or death! Social and moral truths, generally, how are they received by the world? What sort of a greeting doth the indolent, and selfish, and sensual crowd, accord to them? Even in this enlightened com- munity, doth not a vast majority; both of young and old, prefer gazing at the legs of a dancer, or gaping over the tricks of a juggler, to listening to the calm, wise words of a Webster, even, or a Dewey? The one may read his profound political lessons, and the other unfold his comprehensive views of life, in small chapels, to select but slender audiences, while there is not even standing-room, at the nightly reunions of Negro Minstrels, and the soirees of Magicians are thronged with starers! Truth in Art, too; are we prompt to recognize and appreciate, to applaud and reward it? What painter ever told more glorious truths, with his pen- il, than Cole? Was not the beautiful ever minis- I   tering unto the good, in his inestimable pictures? And yet, could all his genius keep poverty from his door? No. At the same time, every absurd carn- cature, every filthy lithograph, that figured in the I   shop-windows, was sure of its thousands of puy- i.

The painter of titled harlots was loaded with orders, and ribbons, and favors, while his poor brother artist, with an hundred fold his genius and character, could only dream of. glory, in his garret, and wake, to starva- tion, in a prison. Truth-tellers, generally, be they Inventors or Dis- coverers, Philosophers or Philanthropists, how hath it fared with them, on the whole, since the year one, at the hands of their brethren? Have plaudits and laurels, or sneers and stripes been their reward?- Have they been more familiar with the painted ceilings of palaces, or the damp walls of dungeons? Have showers of dollars, or of brickbats, been their almost invariable portion? There is a quaint passage, on this subject, in a queer little book, which my lamented friend Nubbins ventured to consign to print, a few years since. I may well say, ventured, for, somehow or other, only two copies of the work ever found buyers. "Is it not marvellous, how, in our dealings with Truth, we completely reverse all the beautiful max- ims, the observance of which maketh society the Paradise it is! Ordinarily, we sing people's praises to their faces; and when their backs are turned, proceed straightway to indemnify ourselves therefor, by copious and vigorous slanders: whereas, in the   case of her Divine Ladyship, we all, with one ac- cord, chant peans about- her, in her absence, and yet have nought but cold words, cold looks, cold shoulders, to greet her withal! Is it not so? In what profession, in what walk of life, is her's a wel- come presence? Will even the controversialist, her professed champion, allow her a place in his pages, or her dearest friend, the Divine, give her a com- fortable lodgment, in his sermons? The Lawyer will not suffer her to look over his brief; the Doctor dare not show her. either his bills or his prescrip- tions. The Epicure forsaketh her straightway, for his dainties, the Voluptuary for his guilty pleasures. The Editor banisheth her from his leaders, and his subscribers, from their advertisements. The Poet will have nought to do with her; and if, in spite of him, she will sometimes appear in his verses, he most effectually expels her from his prefaces and dedications. The Beauty cannot abide her, either in ball-room, or in boudoir, and the Philosopher him- self, shame on him, is ready to abandon her, at any moment, for pudding, or for praise. The Menial slammeth his master's door in her face; the Fop cuttkth her, in the streets, and the Debtor turneth sharp corners to avoid her. The very Beggars will have no dealings with her.

TRUISMS ABOUT TRUTH. is it any wonder, that she is so anxious to return to the Heaven from whence she came, since wicked lnortals are, and ever have been, doing their utmost to make Earth uncomfortable and repulsive to her!" I can't help thinking, by the way, that this same little work of Nubbins, deserved a somewhat better fate, than that profound oblivion which so effectu- ally overtook it; for, though decidedly stilted in style, and abounding in a certain affectation of originality, there are good thoughts in it. But to return to my oracular friend. Among other things, he remarked, with a peremptory wave of the hand, that. no circumstances under Heaven, could ever justify a lie. Such a bit of ultraism might have been expected, perhaps, from such a quarter. It surely will not bear a moment's inspec- tion. Rare, indeed, are the cases, when we are thus cornered; thus compelled to part company with truth. But when they do occur; when, for instance, there is no other way of saving the life, or honor of a wife, or child, or dear friend, from evil-minded violence, or from a scandal-mongering world, what heart can he- sitate a moment in the matter? What tongue with- hold its falsehood in such a case? Out with it, man. Heaven will forgive it, nay, smile upon it, for the very motive's sake. Nay more; may there not be circumstances, where-   TRUISMS ABOUT TRUTH.      135 in a lie would be a perfect feather in its teller's cap? If no such case, as the following, for instance, ever has occurred, how easily, might it. Suppose then, you had been an officer, serving un- der Washington. Suppose your duty had called you to act in his immediate neighborhood, in some hard- fought-battle. The fight is a fierce, and desperate one. Fortune is frowning upon your side. In his zeal and anxiety, the general has quite lost sight of his own safety, and has involved himself in the very thickest of the fight. In the height of the tumult, you find yourself surrounded, and taken prisoner. It is evident, from the exultation of your captors, that they have mistaken you for the commander-in-chief. You at once see their error, and forthwith, do all that in you lies, positively and negatively, by look, word, and action, to favor the deception. - You thereby cre- ate a diversion, for the moment, which enables him to disentangle himself from the enemy. He makes good his retreat to another part of the field. The very timeliness of his escape inspires him with new ardor, his soldiers with new courage. They rally again, at his bidding. His words and presence are a cordial to them. And now they fight like devils, un- der,him; the tide begins to turn; the foe gives way, and, finally, a glorious victory is gained. And your  &#xD;<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC8088-00000067"/> 186     TRUISMS ABOUT TRUTH prompt, and prudent conduct, at a critical moment, was the cause thereof. But, my friend, you were guilty of deception, gross deception. If you did not originate, you at least aided and abetted in a lie. Now, I must take the liberty of calling a false- hood, told under such circumstances, a glorious, a magnificent falsehood. Suppose you had acted other- wise, and the day had, thereby, been lost, what sort of a vindication would it have been of your conduct, had you said, that such was your profound, and ha- bitual reverence for truth, that even in such an emer- gency as this, you could not suffer the mind of an enemy, even, to be thus criminally abused? An indignant pish, and a look of utter scorn, would, of course, have been the only appropriate reply to such an- explanation. As it is, the transaction will stand to your eternal credit, on the page of the his- torian, and your descendants will be proud to bear ,your name. The following passage, which I ran against the other day, in that storehouse of grand and beautiful thoughts, Lamb's Dramatic Poets, seems to me, to contain in its eight little lines, far more that is both striking, and appropriate, on this subject, than could be extracted from an eight hours' talk thereon, by   TRUISMS ABOUT TRUTH.         137 any such prosy individual as       .

Poor fellow, he bruised his shins badly, besides breaking any number of bottles, and having his eyes most satis- factorily damned by the driver. But the lesson will be completely thrown away upon him. He'll be do- ing something just as absurd, to-morrow. It was no longer ago -than last Sunday, that he testified his ap- probation of the discourse, by vehement applause. I don't wonder at it. The sermon was a glorious one. One of Dr. B.'s best; full of earnest, glowing passages. The effect of such a demonstration may be readily imagined. The scene which it caused, ended in a pressing invitation, on the part'of the sexton, to retire; with which, greatly mystified and ermbaras- sed,   finally complied, to the great relief of all present. This same man came very near going to a funeral, the other day, at which he had been invited   THE ABSENT-MNDED MAN.     139 to act as pall-bearer, in a white drilling roundabout. Luckily he was stopped in good season, and another shameful contre-temps was avoided. The most lu- dicrous manifestation of this infirmity of his, though, that I ever witnessed, was his addressing an assem- blage of slaughtered hogs, in the Bowery. Poor things, there they were, prettily arranged, on a par- cel of old barrels, in front of a grocery, most scien- tifically cloven and embowelled, their heads all point- ing to the east, their innocent jaws duly distended with corn-cobs; forming, altogether, a most gracious and pathetic spectacle. --- , however, evidently mistook them for a jury of his country, and immedi- ately commenced an argument before them. I have no doubt it would have turned out to have been a most able and interesting one, too, had I not, fortu- nately, been by, and nipped it in the bud; not, how- ever, before a considerable collection of admirers had come together. Really, his family ought not to allow him to go out alone. It is perfectly amazing that he has not, long ere this, been killed, or drowned, or, at least, seri- ously injured.

One of the very first, of these same daubs, that I ran against, was Kensett's Mount Washington, as seen from the Valley of Conway. Yes, there was the glorious old fellow, in propria persona, with his gallant compeers about him; his brows crowned with eternal snow; lifting his venerable head into the soft, summer sky; June sitting at his feet, in all her freshness and verdure. What a daub! Close by it, is another perpetration, by the same pretender, called the Indian Rendezvous. Infa- mous! why, this man knows no more about land- scapes, than Bryant does about poetry, or Crawford about sculpture, or Haviland about architecture!  &#xD;<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC8088-00000071"/> "4     ART-UNION GLANCES. Hard by, is another abomination, by one Church, denominated New England Scenery. Such a mis- erable coming together of wood and water, would have disgraced even that, tinkerer of landscapes, Dominiching himself! How could I have been such an ass, as to linger over it? nay, to feel the tears stealing into my eyes, as I gazed upon the old mill, and the waterfall, and the wagon crossing the bridge. and- that little promontory struggling out into the sunshine, and the groups of hills, and the spires peeping out of the woods, and at that great pile of white clouds, in the distance! Horrible, horrible performance! What a bit of swindling, on canvass, too, is'that alongside of it! that Cavalier, I mean, by Elliott. Spiritless, inexpressive thing! How any man could paint, or any Art-Union could purchase, such a thing, is indeed, a mystery. Why, it is unworthy, even of Rubens himself, or the dauber, Vandyck! That atrocious affair, likewise, by Woodville, the Game of Chess! I should as soon think of throw- ing away my money on Van Ostade, or 'Gerard Dow! And the Gallery is full of just such humbugs. See that-rascally daub,'by Huntington, for instance. Yes, that same wild, grand, poetical daub of a land- scape. Who dare say, that- there is any romanceoi   ART-UNION GLANCES.      145 ol sentiment, in that picture? any evidences, in- deed, either of' thought, or of labor? Somehow or other, as I gaze upon that shattered trunk, and that mysteriously black and tranquil lake, with its brawling outlet of a brook, and the frowning rocks above it, and the trees still struggling with the gale, and the tumultuous sky overhead, and the dreary cavern, and the solitary figure in armor, and, above all, the beautiffil vista beyond, Hcan't help sighing - after the good old days of chivalry, can't help re- gretting, that I belong to this bustling, democratic, nineteenth century! See. that abominable daub, too, by Durand, nearly opposite. A man, who is all the time doing horrible things of the kind, but this, :mast horrible! Oh, who would not give. all his-lands and goods, to be able to daub, in this fashion? Who, that is imprisoned in town, all his days, condemned to drag his heels over these eternal pavements, does not feel refreshed by, and profoundly grateful for, such a bit of Nature?- That placid, winding stream, and the spreading trees upoti its banks, and those comfortable cattle and sheep, and the long shadows of evening, stealing across that cozy road, are they not a perfect cordial to the eyes,? Doth not the whole scene speak unto us,. of plenty, and peace, and good will?

Here are kindred atrocities, too, by Gifford; transcripts of the all-glorious Cattskills; and a por- trait of Echo0Lake, that little charmer, hid away among the White Hills. That terrible humbug, opposite, is Church!s Beacon. Don't be caught looking at it. There is neither sense of beauty, nor knowledge of perspective, in the man, who painted those gorgeous clouds, or that purple sea beneath them! But why dwell on the innumerable monstrosities of this rascally collection? Such deliberate'insults, alike to the eyes and understanding, as Leutze's Amazon,- for instance, and Boutelle's Trout Brook, and Cropsey's Autumnal Scenery, and Rossiter's Beauties, and Heyne's -Niagara, and a host of others! That charming, sunshiny little thing, in marble, too, under the glass case; the Infant Ceres, by Palmer, with its pretty border of wheaten stalks, and the poppies braided in the hair.; .that, I -suppose, - wouldn't take, as a present; wouldn't pay the porterage on it, I dare say. Out upon such a puppy! The idea, that a pert, flippant, jackanapes, like-him, who is of no more weight,: or significance in the community, than the   ART-UNION GLANCES.      147 very cane that he twirls about his fingers, should have the audacity to speak thufs, of such a Gallery as this! Pah! But keep cool, man, keep cool. Perhaps you are not appearing to much more advantage, yourself. Your indiscriminate raptures, are they not as offen- sive to true critics, as the sweeping censures of this same ignoramus . True. I ought to speak with becoming quietness and modesty, upon this subject. I am neither draughtsman nor colorist, and have but a very limit- ed and vague notion of the rules of art. Still I do profess to have some sensibility in my composition; and when I find my cheeks glowing, and my eyes moistening, as I stand; looking at a picture, I cannot be condemned to barren silence. I must and will air my feelings about it. But are there no real failures, no veritable hum- bugs, in this large assortment? In my humble judgment, hardly one. There are all degrees of merit, certainly, and stages of progress. Buds, blossoms, golden fruit. There are many paint- ings, perhaps, that might be called promises, rather than performances. But isn't this the very place for them? There are others, that don't accord ex- actly, with my poor notions. The German land- scapes, for instance, seem to me, to have too much  &#xD;<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC8088-00000073"/> t8     ART-UNION GLANCES. finery about them.   The rocks, and flowers, and weeds,' are painfully elaborated; and in their histori-. cal pieces, I think they spend too much time and paint, upon unimportant details. Does not even Leutze himself, sometimes expend too much of his giant strength, upon draperies and accessories, and not leave enough for the expressions of his faces ? There are some, too, that appear rather gay, for truth; that look more'like re-unions of rainbows, than faithful copies of the phenomena of nature. There -are some stray portraits of dogs, too, and speaking likenesses-of lobsters and water-melons, that I cannot get interested in. There are one or two groups of children, that are altogether too stiff, and well-behaved, to chime in with my views. I would have preferred to have seen the little darlings far more dirtry, and hearty, and natural; engaged in investigating puddles, manufacturing mud pies, or some such employment, so congenial to childhood; and not to have had them locked up, as they are, in silks, and satins, and self-consciousness. There are some few others, too, that, though they catch the -eye at first, one would not care to have for parlor companions, or be compelled to look at, the first thing in the morning, from one's pillow. But that, as a whole, there is far, far more to please, and to-instruct, in the Gallery, than- there is    ART-UNION -GLANCES.      149 to find fault with, every intelligent, candid man must admit. For myself, at least, modesty, decency, com- mon gratitude forbid, that I should say otherwise. Ah, if the people who come here, were one quarter part as interesting as the pictures! But how few, how very few of those, who enter this, or any other Gallery of Art, seem to be worthy recipients of the repast spread out before them!  Some, like the puppy I met at the door, come, merely to air their own importance. It is evident, from the behavior of these empty-headed, would-be patrons, that they consider their presence, alike condescending in them- selves, and complimentary to the collection. And yet, they can hardly tell a Cruickshanks from a Murillo! Others, in their hopeless ignorance, and profound bewilderment, present an appearance, alike ludicrous and lamentable. They seem to be about as much at home here, as a drove of hogs would be in a drawing-room. Others hurry, and fuss along, catalogue in hand, without the slightest regard to the comfort, or corns, of their neighbors. They have got a job to go through, and the sooner it is over, the better. One individual I actually heard apolo- gizing to his friend, for being present. He was driven in, he said, by a shower. The wretch ! Oth- ers go about, entertaining their female friends, with their loud and flippant criticisms, pointing out the  &#xD;<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC8088-00000074"/> ; 150     ART-UNION GLANCES. beauties, with their sticks, or poking the canvass with their umbrellas. Occasionally, a gang of Van- dals bursts in, strangers alike to art and manners, who crack their filthy jokes, and throw their vile tobacco-juice about, without the slightest decency or remorse. Oh, what a mere handful, of all who come hither, are well-bred; courteous, refined! How few bring with them, tranquil minds, intelligent perceptions, a serene brow, an unclouded temper, a teachable spirit! -How: few, who are not tainted with conceit, or affectation, or prejudice; who can see merit, in what comes into collision with their own theories; can retract gracefully, their hasty opinions, or in- genuously acknowledge their ignorance. How few, who seem at all alive to the true claims of artists, or to the value and dignity of their calling. Is it extravagant to say, that, of all places on earth, a Picture Gallery is that, where the minor infirmities of poor human nature, are most conspicu- ously and painfully visible?    THE FASTIDIOUS MAN. AH! there goes my. friend   , down to his business. He certainly don't look as if he was taking a willing spirit along with him. No, indeed. Nor is it to be wondered at. Nature never intended him for a lawyer. That fastidious taste, that sensitive organization, those delicate perceptions of his, con- firmed and directed as they have been by a corres- ponding education, how utterly they unfit him for such employments, and controversies, as lawyers have to deal with. Those hands of his, are they not far better fitted for the pen of the critic, or the pen- cil of the artist, than for inditing declarations, or sawing the air, in courts? Are they not almost as much out of place in these latter employments, as they would be, wielding the butcher's knife, or the whip of the cattle-driver? And what has he been about, probably, this morn- ing, by way of preparation for the labors of the day? Reading an act of As You Like It, most likely, or a scene or two out of Comus; or lingering over Hun- tington's Mercy's Dream, or an engraving after Ra- phael, or something of a kindred nature. Perhaps,  &#xD;<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC8088-00000075"/> 152     THE FASTIDIOUS MAN. a grand, stirring passage from Webster, or Everett.

Very probably, he Will stop in, on his way down, to hear his friend   , discourse eloquent music on his piano. Something grand and gloomy, from Bee- thoven, or sparkling and effervescing, from Rossini: something, at any rate, that will be a most appropri- ate introduction -to replications, and subpoenas, and fascinating answers in Chancery! If, as the prince of critics hath expressed it, a so- lemn strain upon the organ, ought ever to go before the reading of the sublime verse of Milton, pray, what manner of music would most fitly usher in the perusal of those'documents which constitute the sum and substance of nine-tenths of the legal controver- sies afloat? In my poor judgment, the only proper prelude to such investigations, would be found in those sounds that emanate from a pen of crowded, hungry hogs. ,  Such a pen, itself, too, doth it not, too well, typify the greater part of our Courts of Justice, and em- phatically, the Marine Court? What business, indeed; hatli so refined, and poeti- cally inclined a man as   , in such a scene; the arena of threepenny wrangles, and ceaseless slang- whanging; where the air is even fouler than the   THE FASTIDIOUS MAN,      153 language; where the fleas are even thicker than the falsehoods; where Justice herself is compelled to hold her nose, while pronouncing her decrees! And the people whom he will meet, or overtake, upon his way down, how many of them will come up to his ideal, will harmonize at all with his fastidious notions? How many Orlandos, and Rosalinds, and Mercutios will he find? How many Bayards, and Sydneys, and Hampdens, and Miltons? How many, who vill be either picturesque in costume, graceful in bearing, or courteous in deportment? ,That throng of anxious, restless mortals, hurrying along, under those cylindrical head-pieces, in those most unpoeti- cal of pantaloons, with their hands buried in those many-pocketed overcoats, as they go to their respec- tive places of business, with all the directness and rapidity of locomotives, do they, do they make an agreeable appeal to the artistic eye? Do they be- long to the same planet with that group of philoso- phers, which is even now, perhaps, present to this man's fancy, as they are disposed gracefully about , the steps of that classic temple, in the immortal school of Athens? And the faces under those bon- nets, and the figures under those wadded plaids, what have they in common with the glorious creatures that dance about the car of Phoebus, in Guido's delicious Aurora.?  &#xD;<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC8088-00000076"/> 154     THE FASTIDIOUS MAN. True: but then, what right has this man to ex- pect to meet any such apparitions in these bustling streets, this hard-working generation of ours? Is he not altogether unreasonable in this matter? What business hath he to be eternally making these com- parisons; to be eternally confronting his ideal with the actual; to be forever extolling and hugging his own dreams and fancies, and disparaging, and turn- ing his back upon the stern, wholesome realities around him-  How much wiser it would be in him, instead of feeding and stimulating this propensity of his, in- stead of thus cultivating to excess, his sense of the beautiful, and the intellectual, and thus more and more unfitting himself continually, for the station which God has assigned to him, and the duties that belong to it, instead of all this, to take a directly op- posite course; to bid farewell at once to Dream- Land, with all its fascinating inhabitants, and gor- geous scenery, and come forth manfully, and grapple a with the realities of life. No matter how repulsive they may be, to plunge right in, and make the best of them; to abandon, forthwith, the Muses, and the Graces, and to take right hold of the dirty facts, and complicated rascalities, that always have formed, and ever will form, so large a part of each day's busi- ness. Such are the arrangements of Providence.   THE FASTIDIOUS MAN.      155 Why waste one's breath in sighing over them, or grumbling about them? It is your portion to live in an age and land, where Poetry and Art are seconda- ry matters, and where hard, solid, dirty work, is the order of the day. Why not submit, then, and act accordingly? Why not play your part faithfully, as set down' for you in the Programme of the Great Disposer? Look things, and men, fairly in the face. Try to mend them, but don't run away from them; don't be forever taking refuge from them, in your own dainty visions. The life that this man so greatly affects, which he would so gladly exchange for his present, unpalatable one, what is it, after all, but one of literary epicur- ism? There is nothing gross, or brutal about it; nay, much that is engaging and fascinating, and that makes its votary so. But is it not, neverthe- less, an unmanly backing-out of the wholesome re- sponsibilities, the needful discipline of existence? The Lord never meant that we should spend our days lingering-over pictures, or extracting the sweets stored away in the verses of poets, or hanging upon the accents of orators, or listening to dainty music, or neglecting the solid structures of earth for our own dreamy air-castles. No, not even the fair face of Nature, or the bewildering beauty of woman, must be gazed at too long or'fondly; must take us from  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC8088-00000077"/> "156     THE FASTIDIOUS MAN. our wholesome tasks. These things are life's com- forts, consolations, not its duties. Flowers are beau- tiful, but oh, the homely, precious grain must first be secured, with toil and sweat, before we are at liberty to dwell upon their beauties, and see God's goodness shining through them. To hold them eternally under our noses, or to make our beds of them, is to be Sy- barites, not men. Sunsets are beautiful, but we- must not lose ourselves in them. Nay, hath not the Lord, in his wisdom, deferred their beauties till the day's work is done? Such phenomena, at noontide, would only be diverting us from our appropriate tasks. Work, work, work. Such, indeed is, and has been- the order of the day, since the first day dawned on earth. Let no man seek to dodge it, or to shirk out of it. No, you may not stop to prattle, even with Rosalind herself, or to philosophize with Hamlet, or to gaze at Madonnas, or to moralize in gardens of roses, when there is such a world of needful labor to be done; such an incessant warfare to be waged with filth, and want, and wickedness. Somebody has got to do all these things, which, if left undone, would make our planet utterly abominable, and untenant- able, before another moon hove in sight. So, fall in, my dear fellow, fall into the ranks cheer- fully, Remove thaS unbecoming cloud from that   THE FASTIDIOUS M 4N.     157 handsome face of yours, and take your proper place in the great army of doers. Try to be reconciled to your legal tasks. Try to discover hidden treasures in those documents with which you are daily called to deal. It is true, that the hog-latin in which they abound, differeth largely from the language of Ci- cero's Discourses, or Horace's Odes. It is true, that the Marine Court, and the Court of Common Pleas, do not vividly recall the Areopagus, or the stately Roman Senate. But if far homelier, and fil- thier, may they not be also, far honester places? May not more real justice be rendered, more en- lightened principles be enforced in them, than were ever dreamed of in those showy, picturesque tribu- nals of old? Try to take comfort in that thought. But seriously, is there not, after all, a great deal more of Poetry, and Romance, in this working-day age and nation of ours, than they have credit for? Has not the workshop its poetical side? Is there no latent poetry in Steam? Think of the infinitely varied, the incredible labors, which it is incessantly performing in the service of man; and. above all, 9f the flood of intellectual light which it is continually shedding upon the world. Did I not, through its agency, get, this very morning, for one poor penny, a most generous meal of wholesome, mental food? There was a speech by Kossuth, another by Web-  &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC8088-00000078"/> 158     THE FASTIDIOUS MAN. ster, telegraphic despatches from all the corners of the land, editorials, criticism, poetry, advertisements, information on all sorts of subjects, thinking-mate- rials for a whole twelvemonth? And all this, for one solitary cent. Pray, what sort of an intellec- tual repast could a contemporary of Socrates have got, for his obolus, or a fellow-citizen of Cicero, for his Sestertius? Is there not something grand, and inspiring, in the contemplation of the results, that must grow out of all these resources and facilities'! Is there noth- ing poetical in these wonder-working telegraphs of ours? If the doings of that glorious knight-errant, Hercules, and the exploits of more recent Paladins, have won such honors, at .the Muses' hands, shall not the miracles of Lightning have their poet? Is not Fame far better worth having, now, that Steam and Lightning are her ministers?  Now, she can send the winged-words of her orators, half across the planet, before they have even reached their pero- rations ; and, in a little week, almost, all the nations of the earth, have become, as it were, their audience. How was it, in the Uays of Demosthenes? What sort of a hearing had he, in comparison? Isn't it the merest luck in the world, too, that any fragments of his wonderful talk, have escaped the jaws of Time? Even Homer's verse, had it not a hard struggle, to   THE FASTIDIOUS MAN.       159 keep out of the clutches of Oblivion?. But now, what conceivable combination of circumstances, short of the great final conflagration, could deprive us of Shakspeare or Milton? Who will not sing the praises, then, of Steam and Lightning, that, in addi- tion to their world of more humble labors, are thus the great distributors and perpetuators of the goodly fruits of genius? Again, I would ask, have the labors of Hercules received their epics, and will the Muses begrudge a poor sonnet, even, to the hundred- fold mightier labors of these great high-priests of 'their temple? Is there nothing poetical in all these great enter- prises, these associated energies, about us? this grand battle, with Time and Space, that we are fighting; this invasion of the wilderness; this gal- lant crusade against ignorance and superstition; this going forth to grapple with the elements, in their own dens? Surely, the planet is more interesting and entertaining, now, than ever, when we know so much more of its resources and attributes, of its own history, as written by itself, and of its true bearingq in the skies. More romantic and poetical, too, than ever. Science is the ally, not the enemy, of Poetry, Her throne is founded, not on ignorance and degra- dation, like- the Papal, but on knowledge. Every new truth is a new weapon, in the poet's hands.  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC8088-00000079"/> 160     THE FASTIDIOUS MAN. Yes, the world is far better worth living in, in every way, than ever it was. There is far more in it, to excite the imagination, arouse the zeal, expand the soul of man, than ever. This town of ours, is an altogether more desirable residence, to-day, for a man of thought, or action, than Rome and Athens were, in the height of their splendor. We are a stronger, wiser, more intelligent, and, by all odds, Inore respectable set of fellows. We look through most powerful telescopes, at these same worthies of old. Why, the whole Peloponnesus might have been stowed away in New-Jersey, and all Attica was not so large as Long-Island. A couple of our steam- frigates -could have annihilated, in a few hours, the combined Persian and Grecian fleets, at Salamis. Leonidas fought handsomely, at Thermopylae; but suppose old Zack had been in possession, there, and Capt.

Whether the mem- bers were too amiable, or too indolent, to discuss the subject announced, it might be dangerous to say, in this world of mixed motives, and extraordinary men- tal phenomena. Mystifico then read the following document, being, as he remarked, a translation made' by him, while at Padua, of a part of St. Anthony's celebrated Sermon to the Fishes. The original is, preserved, though in a sadly mutilated state, in the library of the University there, the venerable keeper of which, kindly gave M. access to it. The translation, it will be seen, only covers that part of the Saint's remarks, that were addressed to the oyster portion of his au- dience. How wonderfully have his prophecies been fulfilled!

That principle of compensation, which is so conspicuous in all the other dealings of Provi- dence, is it not equally to be seen, in your case? What baneful thing, indeed, have we from Heaven, without its corresponding antidote? Doth not the same Power, that visits us with rats and mice, for instance, also send us efficient terriers, and able mousers? And is it not your especial privilege, in return for your many deprivations, that you have a far wider place, than all your co-tenants of the wa- ter, in the affections of Man-creation's omnivorous lord?

At the close of this Pindaric outhurst, Scroggins, rather ill-naturedly, as I thought, remarked that the pleasure which the lines had afforded him, was a good deal marred by the feeling that they were a palpable imitation, (almost amounting to plagiarism,) of the Ancient Mariner.

POOR Wiggins! I found him at it again, this morning, worse than ever. He was actually kick- ing his hat around the room, when I entered. I ac- costed him. "Don't say a word to me. Sit down. Sit-down. I must, and will have the frolic out." A queer frolic, I thought. I obeyed, however, in silence. He continued his labors, and rode circuit, in this furious style, some half dozen times, before finally sitting down in his easy chair. "Ah," said he, "I feel relieved, tranquillized." "I'm glad to hear it; but really, I should think you might find some more dignified, and rational mode of recovering your equilibrium. Look at that hat.- What would the servants say? What would a stranger think, who should witness such an abomi- nable manifestation?" "Oh, said he, ' ifd you only knew what comfort that operation yielded me, you wouldn't talk so.

I know I shall be called a slanderer, and a vilifier, for presuming to speak thus of this magnificent 19th century of ours. But with all its big words, and lofty pretensions, will its conduct really bear any more searching inspection than that of its predeces- sors? Gloriouts are its watchwords; Order, Peace, Progress; but those, in whose mouths they figure most, do they fight gloriously for them? or rather, do they not mainly apply them to the outward, mate- rial interests of society, and not to the life within? In the same spirit, we call this the Great Age of In- ternal Improvements. But those far more essential internal improvements, that appertain unto the cha- racter, that have to deal with the temper, and the conscience, are they going ahead so very fast? Are we multiplying -our communications with Heaven? Are we sending more prayers thither, and getting more supplies of grace and goodness in return? Are we transacting one whit more business with the an- gels, than our forefathers did? I doubt it. I, may be very unfortunate in my acquaintances.

Well; is it not all right? Poor things, they had their day; their little day of beauty, and of fra- grance, and they are off. They fulfilled their desti- ny. They delighted the eye. They regaled the nose. They told their story prettily. They con- veyed their sentiment charmingly. They had their moral uses, too, for they helped strengthen that bond of love which, should ever bind kindred together. Ah, if we all played our parts as faithfully in this world, what a happy one it would be! But to think that the fair eyes that gazed upon them, the fair hands that gathered them, have got to take the same dreary road.

No man. Long before his time came, he would be eager, anxious, crazy to be off. Why shouldn't he? What should keep him? The only decent excuse for stay- ing, would be a wish to continue his labors of love to his brethren. And when has the man appeared on the planet, so righteous tL at he could honestly urge such a plea, or the hypocrite, so unblushing, that he would have the face to allege it? And as to the other inducements, the pleasures, pomps, and vani- ties of life, one century is quite enough to sift them in, and to feel their unsatisfactory hollowness.

Who will deny this? Surely, a hundred years' faithful study would bring all earth's sciences at our feet. As with the languages, so with them; the thorough knowledge of some three or four, would make the subjugation of all the rest, comparative child's play. And thus, our very acquisitions would, long ere our lease had expired, have made us all the more restless, and impatient for our flight. This is all very well, you say; and a delightful thing it would be, if we could take that same flight, bodily, to some other planet.

No, no. Depend upon it, the pre- sent arrangements are altogether the wisest, and the kindest for us, and the sooner we are reconciled to them the better. It is this very perishableness, indeed, that gives half their zest to the joys of earth. The wife of one's bosom, the children that frolic about one's fire- side, could we love them as we do, but for the fear and dread that are forever mingling with that love; the ever-present sense of the frail nature of the tie that holds us together, that any moment, any paltry casualty may snap asunder? Were it otherwise, where would all these happy couples, these fond pa- rents, these good children be, at the end of a little twelvemonth? Alas, for poor human nature, ewho does not feel that love would be a sad loser, by any change of dispensation?

Unwise and wicked as such conduct would be, yet dare any candid man or woman deny that we should have a hundred-fold greater amount of heart-burnings, jarrings, bicker- ings, wranglings, than will probably come off under the present arrangements? Those same flowers, too, that I was so disposed to bewail, and grow sentimental over; suppose they had been of wax, or of feathers; gifts that they were, would they not soon- have degenerated into downright impertinences? Would I not have been compelled, in mere self-defense, to have stowed them away in some dark corner or other? To be sure, there might have been other reasons for such a course. There is an intrinsic atrocity about all wax-work. There is no living with- it, either in the shape of flow- er, fruit, or hero.

Was it not the very feeling that the first warm glance of the sun would melt it into air, that gave it half its lustre? And so with all other things under that sun, be they passions, or the objects of them. Eternal love, unfading joy, unalterable constancy!

With those ardent Italian temperaments of theirs; with that liquid language, too, which affords such amazing facilities for scolding and objurgation, as well as for love-prattle; with those unpleasant reminiscences of hereditary feuds, that willy nilly would come up oc- casionally to annoy them; catn there be any doubt, that, had they lived, they would have had their full proportion of family jars .

The more one dwells upon it, the more anomalous, the more monstrous does this idea of running away from death appear. Who, indeed, would give up the glorious privilege of dying? Who would consent to remain here, a perpetual prisoner in this insignifi- cant corner of the universe? What would you think of a man who should wilfully persist in lock- ing himself up all his days in Berghen or Commu- nipaw, without paying a solitary visit, nay, without casting a single glance across the Bay at this great metropolis of ours?

Let my flesh be- come a banquet for worms, anid my bones subside into the dust from which they sprang. Let me play out the play, epilogue and all, to the very letter. Let me not be cheated out of any of the genuine, legiti- mate experiences of life. How ungenerous, too, how contemptible in me, who make a hearty, well-varied meal each day, to begrudge the worms their portion at the appointed season! Or if death come somewhat out of season; if he anticipate his mission by a few years; if he surprise me in the noontide of life, in the midst of all its busy plans, and high hopes, and warm affections, still let me not wilfully misinterpret and pervert the spirit of that mission.

Nine-tenths of his discourse, I confess, was little better than so much Chaldee, to me; and of the other tenth, pre- cious little was in harmony with my humble, old- fashioned notions. I could not, for the life of me, see, for instance, how any man could, by the mere exercise of his will, aided by a few picturesque manipulations, magically convert a sick young woman, most penuriously en- dowed, when in the normal state, with either facts or ideas, into a perfect, (pro-tempore,) she-Milton; how he could make her see, out of the back of her head, a hundred-fold more and greater sights, than Solomon, or Shakspeare, could ever see, out of the front of his; or how he could make her hold friendly and familiar chats, with individuals, not merely in other planets of our own system, but residents of other systems.  &#xD;<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC8088-00000091"/> 184   FLIGHTS OF HOBBY-STRIDERS.

There was a Peace Congress in Europe, at the time.   What an event! Oh, what an era in human affairs, was to begin from that day! Wars, and rumors of wars, were to be no more. The reign of good will had fairly commenced, at last. All the belligerent propensities of human nature, were straightway to be eradicated, Babies were no longer to kick, or squall, in nurseries.

Instead of encouraging, and egging on, as heretofore, pug- nacious cats and dogs, to sanguinary encounters, they were to do all that in them  lay, to separate them. Youngsters were no longer to cry aloud for drums, or trumpets, for miniature muskets, or field- pieces; nay, if they should encounter any stray tin soldiers in their toy-boxes, they were to bring them, with an air of dignified rebuke, to their respective mothers.

Who, indeed, would venture to oppose the progress of a scheme, so glorious, and so practi- cable; so in harmony with all God's dealings with his creatures, with all the dearest instincts of our hearts! Where is the miserable sophist to be found, who would dare proclaim the plan, a visionary one? would dare insinuate, that if carried out, it would turn men into flippant smatterers,I and inefficient bunglers? would dare assert, that all past triumphs in art or science, have been the result of untiring, night-and-day devotion to one calling, and not to the cotemporaneous pursuit of a score'? would dare throw out the absurd idea, that God designed one man for a statesman or a poet, and another for a huckster or a knife-grinder?' What, have you the face to say, that under socialistic sway, the world would have been defrauded of the mighty works-of a Mi- chael Angelo, of the plays of a Shakspeare, of the dictionary of a Bayle; of the commentaries of a Kent, and, probably, of the steam-engine itself? Is that any reason for continuing the existing abominable arrangements of society? You might as well allege in their behalf, that under them alone, has the world witnessed the self-devotion of a Wilberforce, the be- nevolence of a Howard, or the patriotism of a Wash- ington.

How . dare a man selfishy pursue any one vocation in life, no matter how strong the impulse may be from within, or the inducements from without, and meanly refuse a hearty, earnest participation in them all .. How dare a Webster hesitate for a moment, when the time arrives, about breakingoff his speech before the Senate, or his argument before the Su- preme Court, and going forth, and skinning his hogs, according ;to the programme of the day? How dare a Channing. refuse, straightway to suspend his sub- lime meditations, and cheerfully take his turn, with his peck-measure, and his sand-cart? Out upon such pitiful, such contracted notions! They belong to an effete, and barbarous age; and the individual, who persists in cherishing and expressing them, de- serves to be, and will be, most liberally bespattered with the epithets of Granny, Ninny, Fogie! Another, and a kindred doctrine, upon which my friend   insists, with equal zeal and emphasis, is, that all men really prefer Right-doing to Wrong- doing, Duty to Self-indulgence. Their intentions, he thinks, are uniformly good, their impulses, uniformly noble. All they want, is light.

The precepts of Christianity, he thinks, are too vague and loosely scattered, to secure this great result; though they might form the basis for some magni- ficent scheme of duty, which, like the other, needs but be fairly seen by men, to secure forthwith, the allegiance of all minds and hearts. Then, indeed, will human happiness be- lastingly, and universally, attained! Oh, into how many violent fits of wrath, has this man been thrown, in the vain attempt to convince me, of the intrinsic amiability of human nature; how many weary hours has he wasted, in equally vain attempts to persuade me, of its indomitable love of labor! But why argue, at all, with a man who proclaims such doctrines? who thus wilfully flies in the face of all reason and experience, thus mis-reads the pages of history, the phenomena of daily life, the workings of his own heart? The evils that afflict society, then, are not to be attributed to these wicked, way- ward natures of ours, but solely to the want of some grand patent medicine, (soon to be provided,) which is straightway to 'cure this universal heart-sickness.  &#xD;<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC8088-00000096"/> 3^;4   FLIGHTS OF HOBBY-STRIDERS. The mission of Christ was a failure, or, at least, a mere paving of the way for some greater teacher, who will soon be here, and the "good time" with him; his irresistible wisdom and eloquence will, at once, convince and compel all human souls into the right path, and Paradise and Earth will become synonyms, thence forward, and forever! This, I confess, sounds to me, amazingly like folly and blasphemy. Had the man been contented with saying, in a plain way, that the augmented diffusion of Education in our day, aided as it is, by the Penny Press and the Electric Telegraph, and the consequent increased circulation of wholesome Christian doctrine through the world, bid fair to be of signal, nay,: speedy benefit to the race, I could- have readily com- prehended, and acquiesced in, such a proposition; but, to plunge headlong into such ultraisms and ex- travagances, as the above, makes one quite out of patience.

Well, I dare say, he'll be quite as glad to be but at the end of his term, and return to private lodgings, as I am sure Ishall.

Well, I must try and make the best of it; find out, if I can, the bright side of my condi- tion, and endeavor to keep my eyes steadily upoin it. One thing I shall certainly learn here; the art of holding my tongue, which I never could do when an outsider. Even here I might find it difficult; but when the alternative is once fairly presented, of si- lence, or the contents of a double-barrelled musket, a man's choice is pretty promptly determined.

To be sure, our edifice has not altogether that cheerful look, that Versailles-like combination of grandeur and elegance, which a Pha- lanstery sought to present; and our discipline is a trifle too rigid to keep up the illusion. Still I try to think so. At other times, and especially on Sunday mornings; as we sit ranged in solemn rows, before the service begins, what with the silence, and the  bare walls, and the uniformity of costume that pre- vails; I am beguiled for a moment into the belief that I am assisting at a Friends' Meeting. The dream is soon over, though.

They are part of the penalty. Let me pay it cheerfully. I shouldn't wonder, O paternal relative, if you should affect to be greatly shocked at the tone of this epistle, as manifesting an incorrigible levity of cha- racter, to say the least.

And yet, after a fair inspection, I must claim some, little credit for myself, on this oc- casion. Had we been alone together, I really be- lieve I should have pursued the same peaceful course. But who are you, that cross-question me thus, and pray, what right have you to expect any such pure and lofty goodness from frail, erring mortals ? Wait till we get to heaven, if you please. There you may hope to find unalloyed wisdom, and virtue, and spirituality; not on this dull, gross earth of ours. Our fleshly tabernacles are utterly unworthy to be the receptacles of things so precious. You might as well expect children, in an infant school, to com- prehend the higher mathematics, as us poor sinners of a day, to fathom the dimensions of true goodness. Pure truth, pure virtue, would be altogether too much for us. Our souls would be. crushed beneath them, just as our frail constitutions would be snap- ped asunder, and shattered, beneath the force of con- centrated poisons.

Magnanimity! Oh, what a world, both of doings, and refrainings, is implied in that one word. To be magnanimous, i. e. to forgive injuries; to submit pa- tiontly to unmerited abuse; to -hold the tongue; to bridle the appetites; to withhold unjust criticisms; to retract hasty opinions; to see good things in an enemy; to live down slanders; to trust to truth, un- der all circumstances; to be tranquil when your good deeds are forgotten, your good things stolen; to sur- render' the floor cheerfully, to one, every way your inferior; to await results patiently, not crying out for fruits in the season of blossoms; to stick to your friend, no matter what may be the circumstances of his birth, or the cut of his coat, or the color of his skin; 'to prefer duty to glory, integrity to populari- ty; to meet misfortune, bereavement, death itself, with a, placid smile; to be all this, to do, or to keep from doing, all these things; where, where is -the man, or woman, who' dare lay claim to virtue so glo- rious, so divine?

Or sit quietly by, when stupid actors are murdering their plays, or when their music is misinterpreted, and mutilated, by in- competent orchestras, and drunken singers? Or can look sweetly when their fine sentences are knocked into nonsense by unfeeling compositors? Or who can even take a touch of the tooth-ache,-or a twinge of (a most righteously earned) gout, without being furious, and blasphemous?      -- Magnanimity, indeed!1 And yet, we certainly do run against a noble specimen of it, now -and then, alike in the pages of history, and the walks of daily life, Fabius Maximus, for example; how gloriously he behaved towards that insolent general of his, Minucius; who, when the latter had insulted him, sneered at him, disobeyed his orders, ind had there- by, at last, involved himself and forces, in imminent peril, came, nevertheless, promptly to the rescue, drove off the enemy, carried the day, and thus saved his unworthy officer from the disgrace and death that he had fairly earned; and, when all was over, sent for him to his tent, received him without word of an- ger, or look of rebuke, applauded his valor, restored him to his command, lay, shared his power with him.

HEARD     'S lecture last night. It was a rare treat. It is pleasant, indeed, in this age of ultraists, to hear such calm, wise doctrines. It is refreshing, to hear a man of such paramount claims, moral and intellectual, upon our esteem, express himself so independently, yet modestly, so mildly, yet most forcibly withal, upon all the exciting topics of the day. He began by avowing himself of neither faction. He was neither Radical nor Conservative. He saw a good deal to admire, and a good deal to condemn, on both sides, and he did not hesitate to speak his mind freely, yet with all due courtesy, to both. Perhaps he bore a little harder upon the former class, than the latter. He certainly did administer some -very effective volleys, to. the more intemperate portion of them; the vanguards, as he styled them, of the various invading armies of inno- vators; especially, did he throw in a smart shower of telling grape, among the Women's Rights' men, and the Socialists. He was emphatically opposed to turning females into masters of vessels, or mem- bers of Congress. He could not bear the idea of  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC8088-00000104"/> 210     LECTURE ON PROGRESS. making marriage a mere partnership; and while, on the one\ hand, he 'was for dropping the word obey, from the matrimonial vow, he could not, on the other, at all relish the notion of being continually remind- ed, by the wife of his bosom, that'she was an inde- penden t property-holder. 'Still less was he for merging his individualism in a phalanstery. He had too great a regard, both for his moral and physical health, to venture upon any such social arrangements. He insisted, most earnestly, upon the value and importance of individual exertion, individual responsibility as being at the bottom   of all true development, all great achieve- ments. Most appropriate advice, surely, in this community and age, of ours, when the man is more and more in danger, every hour, of being swallowed up in the mass; the natural person, in the artificial; the hus- band and the father, in the trustee and the stock- holder; when society itself seems fast degenerating into a mere committee. `Outrageous, indeed, is it, that these same    corporations, mere creatures, ser- vants, instruments, should be thus perverted from their true nature and office; thus be turned into mas- ters, nay, monsters, over-riding, crushing their very contrivers, beneath their wheels! By what right, do they thus monopolize all our energies and pas-   sions, run away with our best thoughts and moments, drain alike our veins and our purses, sacrifice, in a word, our whole individual being, to their merciless exactions ? To think, too, that men, calling them- selves Republicans, should become so perverted, as even to glory in this vile bondage!   Monstrous, indeed, to see a man more attached to a board of directors, than to his own family; to see him setting more store by a string of heartless resolutions, or a newspaper puff, or a paltry pitcher, than by all the joys and endearments of his own fire-side ! But how can I, in this,.blessed era of illumination and progress, indulge in sentiments so childish? What are they, after all, but miserable prejudices, only fit for the fogies of the dark ages ! Oh, thank Godfor such prejudices f What would life be worth, without them ? Horrible notion, that public spirit is to claim precedence in a man's heart, over family ties and duties ! Such public spirit as that, I have'no faiths in. There is far more vanityo and ambition about it, than true regard for the wel- fare of others. I have no faith in that man's philan- thropy, who, while professing to take the whole race into his bosom, is yet a stranger and an alien to his own household! Prejudices, forsooth! It is easy, indeed, for your cold-blooded reformers,  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC8088-00000105"/> 212     LECTURE ON PROGRESS. to preach against prejudices, and to cry up princi- ples; but, while hearts throb in human bosoms, the former?will carry the day. Reason may talk herself hoarse; may keep remonstrating, scolding, from now till Doomsday, without shaking their sov- ereignty. You may call it a very childish prejudice, for in- stance, to prefer' a coin to a bank-note; but what heart has ever yet allowed itself to be argued out of that preference, by any reasoning, however power- ful? Who can help being more fascinated by, and more warmly attached to, the glittering original, than its plausible representative? I care not, how promptly redeemable it may be, or how exquisitely executed, its vignettes. Convertibility into specie, is not specie. As the best description of Niagara, falls far behind the all-glorious reality, so the most insinuating of paper substitutes, comes short of the sparkling, beautiful child of the mint. The heart will not be thus defrauded; " the old Instinct wtill bring back the old forms." But I am  wandering away, most unseasonably and whimsically, as usual, from the lecture in ques- tion.

Had their counsels prevailed, New-York, to-day, would have been, with all its natural endowments, but a small, dull, ill- paved, poorly lighted, Manhattan-water-drinking town. The great charm of the discourse, after all, was the tone of suppressed power, and controlled sensi- bility, that pervaded it. The lecturer might easily have been a hundred-fold more brilliant, witty, and sarcastic, had he chosen might have tickled our ears with fine imagery, or have humored our pas- sions and prejudices; but he preferred to speak the words of truth and soberness.

Yes, he has sung his last song, fought his last fight, delivered his last message, and the curtain will rise upon him no more, for ever! The first time I saw this worthy man, he nearly frightened me out of my wits. I was a small boy, in the pit of the Park Theatre', he, a ferocious Tar- tar, in 'the pay of the sanguinary Timour. What would I have not given, to have got handsomely out of the building! I can hardly help shuddering, even now, when I think of him. How little did I dream, at the time, that I should ever take by the hand, in broad daylight, and exchange pleasant words and smiles, with that infernal-looking ruffian! My- second peep at him, was in "The Miller and his Men." It was in the same spot. I was a few moons older, and a trifle more composed; still, most profoundly impressed. If I remember rightly, was decidedly the most prominent, and bustling, of those same Men.

My third introduction to him, was in Faustus.- He was making himself decidedly useful, as a devil; frisking about the gates of hell, with tail and pitch. fork; full of fun, and brimstone, and all manner of diabolical capers, and head-shakes. Ugh, what a spectacle! I shuddered, while I grinned.  We waited for the farce, I remember. In the course of it, an individual entered with a tray, whereon a cold fowl, bread, and pickles, were 'clearly visible; and when the dear old kinsman, who took me to the play, informed me, that the pleasant, active-looking-man before us, was the identical limb of Satan who had helped poke the Doctor into the flames, I could not, and would not, be persuaded.' It has occurred to me, more than once, since, that the disclosure was an injudicious one. It did no good, and only served to bewilder my tender understanding, to disturb my boyish faith. -But it would take folios, to recapitulate the innu^. merable, the infinitely yaried parts, in which I have seen this most indefatigable of performers; parts celestial, - terrestrial, diabolical; genii of all. sorts   AN OLD FRIEND GONE.-     21T and sizes; fire-kings and water-kings; dragons and sea-serpents; mummies and spectres; not to speak of human beings, of all times, climes, and conditions. I have positively seen him, on the same night, (a gala night,) storming the heights of Monterey, lay- ing siege to the Castle of Dunsinane, dancing atten- dance on the amorous old judge in the Bayadere, and slaughtering pale-faces, with a most effective whoop, in Metamora. More than this; I have seen him both a Montague and a Capulet, within the same half hour. I have seen him brutally murdered in the first act, and yet, going through a quadrille, with unusual spirit, in the fifth. On one occasion, I ab- solutely, beheld him, attending as- mourner, at his own funeral! What must his feelings have been! And, oh, what a treasure to his manager! Doubtless, it was a grateful sense of his general utility, and most praise-worthy assiduity, that in- duced that same manager to tender him a benefit not long since.   , in an evil hour, accepted it. Fatal error! I was present, I remember, with Wig- gins. The house was of the most meagre, discoura- ging character. The orchestra actually outnumber- ed us.

It, was cruel in Wiggins, I thought, to insist upon calling him out, as he did. He responded at last, however, in the following brief speech. "Lady (there was but one present,) and gentlemen, financially considered, this experiment, it must be confessed, is a signal failure. It is painfully evident, that there are hard- ly as many cents in the house, as I did fondly hope, at one, time, that there might have been dollars. It is some consolation, however, to feel that the baker's dozen who have honored me with their presence, have been, in the main, pleased with, and edified by, the entertainments that have been presented. It is better, no doubt, to secure the applause of the judici- ous few, than the dollars of the unthinking multi- tude.- At the same time, neither the management, nor myself, will be caught in such a scrape as this, very soon again.

Wiggins was quite tickled with this. effort; so much so, that he sent    an anonymous X. the next morning. I had no idea myself, that my old friend was so much of a wag or philosopher. To, say truth, our intercourse, though always -of an agreeable character, was not without a certain re- serve. Perhaps my solemn phiz was a restraint upon him; or he may have been saving up his ani- mal spirits for the labors of the evening; or there may have been a latent feeling that his profession was not sufficiently appreciated or esteemed by the public. It certainly is not. Why, I do not'see. The few of that calling that I am acquainted with, seem to be very pleasant, amiable fellows. They are not, as a class, perhaps, quite so methodical as the rest of -their fellow-citizens. They are betterfriends than book-keepers. They are not, generally speak- ing, pew-holders; but though deficient in faith, they surely are not deficient in good works. I have not found them uniformly solvent, I must say; or alto- gether bibbers of Croton; still, good friends, warm, generous hearts.

There were actually four of the villains, at one time, sing- ing, and biting, all together, on the end of my nose. Cunning old stagers; had they lighted on my fore- head, there might have been some chance of annihi- lating them. But their intelligence, confound them, is even greater than their malignity.

Why not   There have been such things, as Parliaments of bees; and their labors of legislation have been sung in some of the sweetest of English poetry. There have been "Convocations of politic worms," too; and wherefore, not, then, a Caucus of mosquitoes? It must have been so; and my poor nose was the scene of their vile intrigues!

This is too bad, said he, to be cheated out of one's rest, and blood, in this scandalous style! I am will- ing to be made a meal of by worms, when my time comes; but as to being tormented, and disfigured, every season, in this way, I don't relish it. And then, to be told, as I was yesterday, by a fool of a Grahamite, that I had no business to indulge in ani- mal food; when I was myseltf a mere supper for mosquitoes, the whole livelong night.

Could it be pos- sible, that I was trifling thus, with one of the gran- dest, noblest, poems in the language! - As to Quizzico's attempt, I must say, I don't think much of it. It may be a slight improvement upon his Tomato-stanzas, but the truth is, the Gods have not made him poetical. He will never soar very high in the first heaven of invention, let alone the seventh. Neither effort will ever see the year of grace, 2,000. Their author must be contented to gather simples and whortleberries, around the base of Parnassus; it is not for him to recline, in laurel- crowned glory, on its summit. His verses are good enough to put round sugar-plums, but not fit to enter into a Book of Gems. Let his Muse confine herself to singing the praises of Cherry Pectorals, Nervous Antidotes, and such like boons to humanity!

THAT was a glorioun passage in e  's lecture, last night, wherein he rebuked the utilitarian notions of the day; that fell spirit of utility, which would trample all sentiment under its feet; those contract- ed ideas of labor; too, which would recognize no man as a worker, who does not rely on his muscles for a living; or whose mental exertions; at any rate, are not enlisted, exclusively, in the service of mate- rial interests. He certainly did bestow upon these doctrines and their champions, the handsome, hearty dressing, that they so richly deserve. High times, indeed, when the hard-fisted sons of labor are to shake their fists in anger, and wag their saucy tongues, against the very philosophers '. whose deep, patient, soul-trying, closet meditations, have been the very means of fur- nishing them with the employments whereby they live! Yes, what would these same men, most of them, have been about, this day, in the way of earn- ing a living, but for the sublime studies 'of a Bacon, and Locke, and Newton, and Milton? And yet, there are not a few in this community, who can hardly   ULTRAISMS OF UTILITARIANS.    227 be brought to recognize any evidences of labor in the Paradise Lost, itself. They can see, to be sure, the labor of the paper-maker, and printer, and-binder, but as for the glorious text itself, that, forsooth, is mere poetry! It is true, that the circulation of that text, helps support that great army of rag-gatherers, paper-makers, compositors, printers, binders, pub- lishers, agents, book-sellers, auctioneers, packers, porters, carriers by sea and land, and others, that form so large a portion of the children of men. That circumstance alone, one would suppose, ought to stop. the mouths of such ungracious, narrow-minded rea- soners. Surely, that which, while it fills so many souls with lofty thoughts, contributes also so much material aid and comfort to so many of our brethren, though the unthinking may sneer at and decry it, will ever command the veneration of all enlightened minds. Out upon such shallow, insolent criticisms! Why, according to such notions, every noisy, horn- blowing fishmonger, that passes his door, would have been justified in pointing the finger of scorn at the idler-poet, as he sate in his porch, lost in those sub- lime visions, the glory and beauty of which, as em- bodied in his immortal verse, will fill the student's mind with wonder and delight, ages and ages hence.

But suppose now, that-a Wordsworth were to enter, and, taking up this same pencil, were to commit to paper, one of the choicest, most elaborate of his son- nets; wherein some profound and subtle thought is most artistically expressed, and clad, withal, in the splendid robes of fancy; something that must and will live, and tell on thoughtful minds, centuries hence; have you, nevertheless, the face to tell me, that the mere tool which the mighty bard made use of, on the occasion, is, indeed, a most praiseworthy product of labor, but that the all-glorious sonnet itself, is mere poetry, mere play, mere fun, forsooth! Pah! Why waste one's breath, why trifle with one's own sense, by arguing with such persons? Why, every flower of the forest gives the lie to such contracted notions. If mere naked utility is to be the measure of value,say so, at once, and act accordingly. Pluck up by the roots, every blessed bud and blossom, that you meet in your path. Choke every warbler of the grove; for his song is a satire on your doctrine. Blot out every sunset from the skies. Take away its blush from the peach, its deli- cate fragrance from the rose.

That series of exquisite little engravings upon my window-panes, which the frost hath wrought in the silent, solemn night; those miniature Alps and forests there, away with them! what signify they, of what manner of use are they, but to minister unto a sickly sentiment or idle fancy! Oh, see you not, to what monstrous, what blas- phemous results, such ultraisms lead us? The Great Architect and Decorator of the universe hath proceeded upon far different principles. He hath scattered abroad, every where, ten thousand thousand appeals to our sentiments' and affections. Had he meant the world for a mere workshop, we should have had corresponding arrangements. The tools of our trade would have been far more accessible. The iron and the stone would have been disposed with far more uniformity, and with far more direct refer- ence to our daily tasks. The trees would have been mere straight, naked trunks ; the rivers as straight, and uniformly placid and well-behaved; the moun- tains would have tapered down into the most accom- modating of hills; every thing would have been as snug, and quiet, and orderly, and busy, and monoto- nous, as a Shaker settlement; and just about as entertaining and attractive.

Why, were the-world to become a plain, to-morrow, and all these melodious voices be thereby, at once and forever, hushed, who can estimate aright the loss of all this precious music to man? Far bet-, ter could we spare all-the scores of all the composers that have ever written. Nay, their value, as moral teachers, how incalculable! I speak it not disre- spectfully, but I verily believe, that it were. far- better for us, if all the sermons of earth were to go to the flames together, sooner than that the lessons which these monitors are continually pouring in our ears, should thus perish in silence forever!

The brook, that prattles, loiters, dances in his path, what is it to him? It is bad enough to see in it, a mere lurking-place for trout; but that is an amiable weak- ness, and may easily be forgiven; but who can par- don this man's perverted vision, who can only behold in it, an infant water-privilege!

One man has the bodily vigor which is best employed in fighting the wilderness, in laying low the forest, in paving the way for the more delicate generations who are to come after him; another has the mental vigor, which fits him for    j invading the wilderness of the law, clearing up its  briars and brambles, brushing away its cobwebs, filling up its pitfalls, and opening a glorious highway to Justice, for the benefit of his feebler-witted breth- ren. All honor to both, in their respective voca- tions. They are doing good service, where they are. What folly, to change places! They would be the sufferers, society the losers, by any such visionary experiment.     - And so with our plays.

Still, why snarl at each other's amusements or labors? Why for- ever make odious distinctions, where nature intend- ed none? Work, and Play, why can't they live together,   ULTRAISMS OF UTILITARIANS.    283 as friends and brethren? Why should either seek to have the planet all to himself? How much more, after all, have they in common, than they are willing to allow! The work that suits a man, that is in any kind of accordance with his abilities and position, how much of the exhilaration of play there is about it! And what play is there, worthy of the name, that can attract or detain us a moment,. that doth not demand much of that discipline, and exertion of faculties, which are essential to all work? This certainly seems to be the most sound, fair, and amiable view of the subject; alike removed from the ultraism of the mere utilitarian, or of the dainty day-dreamer.  s  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC8088-00000116"/> A PASSING CRITICISM. I HAVE been refreshing my inner man, to-day, with a large draught from Hudibras. A pleasant beverage, indeed; as acceptable to the mind, as good old ale is to the body; so clear, and sparkling, and pungent, and nutricious! Delightful, delightful reading! And; yet, upon second thoughts, there is a little spice of bitterness, nay, of sadness, at the bottom of the cup. For, with all this brilliancy, and wit, and profound knowledge, and amazing mastery of language, there is, nevertheless, a cruel spirit per- vading it, that is utterly inexcusable. There is a persevering, unrelenting pursuit of his victim, that it is painful to think of. There is no let-up, no pause, in his satire. Every line is a blow, and a blow between the eyes. He is not contented with stripping off his garments from the hypocrite, but he must tear them into the smallest tatters. He is not satisfied with knocking his man down, but must grind him to powder under his heel; must heap on him every conceivable circumstance of scandal, re- proach, and infamy; pin him against the wall, as it   A PASSING CRITICISM.-     235 were, of the Temple of Fame, and leave him there, an object of derision and contempt,- through all time! And who was this victim? A man under whose roof he had lived, of whose bread he had eaten; a man of no little importance in his day, and, no doubt, with a fair share of good qualities mixed up with his bad ones. Yet, what a frightful figure he cuts, and will cut, till Doomsday'! A disgusting mass of flesh, a most contemptible pedant,- an arrant cow- ard, a liar, thief, hypocrite, an obscene, gluttonous, miserly, shabby, pitiful old scoundrel! Ah, 'twas an ungracious, ungrateful thing; a pretty poor investment of the author's genius, after all. Far better, had he been singing the praises of some good man, or cheering on some noble, enterprise, with his mighty verse. He might, at least, have mixed up some glowing strains, some beautiful descriptions, with all this gall, and not have given us such an unmitigated, merciless mass of satire. The poet, no doubt, lived to regret it; he may be regretting it, even now, in bitterness of heart. He would be right glad, perhaps, this very moment, could he only return to earth, and promptly consign every copy of his work to destruction. But, alas, the opprobrium hath gone forth, never to be recalled. No human power could extinguish it.

It must exist, in all its vivid deformity, till the last syllable of recorded time. Was it not a most righteous retribution, that its author should be overtaken, as he was, by neglect and poverty; almost face to face with starvation; and that no monument should rise over him, till he had lain, near a century, in earth? ' And yet, had he written the purest, and loftiest of poems, he might have had the same unhappy fate. True, but then he would have had conscience oh his side. He would not have been annoyed, tor- mented with the reflection, that he had misused his mighty powers, had expended his giant energies, almost entirely, in throwing stones, and heaping up opprobrious epithets; had, in a word, turned his muse, that might have been a glorious Clio, into an arrant Trulla. Oh, yes, there is a world of bitterness in this same satire, vigorous and brilliant as it is; and there is bitterness in the laugh with which we greet it. Not so, with the gentle raillery of Addison, or of Elia; not so, with the glorious jokes of Hood. There is no malice in their mirth; but here, the hiss of tho serpent is heard continually.   A PASSING CRITICISM.     237 Is the world benefitted by such strains as these? They are no peace-makers, surely, but can only serve to widen breaches, and breed bad blood. Better far be silent. Yes, it would have been better, perhaps, had even this amazing performance never seen day- light. Who knows how many feuds it may have engendered, how many family quarrels it may have kept alive?  Better keep a double lock upon one's lips, than deal out such stinging jokes as these. A magnanimous abstinence from speech, is it not worth far more than the most brilliant volley of sarcasms, that was ever let off?          i Even righteous indignation must hold its peace, at times. How beautifully Cordelia's silence vindi- cates itself, in the end! How much more effective and touching is it, than the most eloquent expose of her sister's perfidy, would have been! And oh that most illustrious example of all: had Christ poured out upon the faithless disciple, a torrent of holy anger, would such an outhurst, even from such lips, have had an hundredth part of the power of that one little look, that look of mingled majesty, and reproach, and sorrow!  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC8088-00000118"/> TRI^ALS AND TRIUMPHS OF LABOR. "There is no difficulty, to him that wills." So saith the illustrious exile, now amongst us. The sentiment, to, be sure, is. not altogether new; but then, there was a pretty, and withal, hearty manner, about his saying it, which, aided by his foreign ac- cent, made it quite irresistible. Unquestionably, the remark is, substantially, true. Meanwhile, however, (to apply it to my humble self) I-am making most frightfully slow progress, in my attempt to get an insight into the German language and literature. I begin to feel quite desperate about it. My movement towards the desired result, is any thing but an allegro movement; oh, no, most deci- dedly adagio, though not altogether, I fear, reli- gioso. Shall I ever read Schiller, or Goethe, in the original, with downright relish? Not on this orb. Possibly, in Sirius, or Arcturus. But would they relish,-if I could get at'them, without an effort? Would Shakspeare himself, or Milton, fill our souls with the divine pleasure that he does, if we did not have to fight our way, dic- tionary in hand, to his lofty meanings; did not have   TRIALS AND TRIUMPHS OF LABOR.-   239 to explore, painfully and patiently, the labyrinths, wherein his subtle thoughts are so fond of taking refuge? Would any mountain-prospect delight us, if we had only to put on our wings, and fly to it, without exertion or fatigue? No; nothing worth having in this world, is to be got without paying roundly for it. Who ever got a girl, worth mentioning, for a wife, without earning his prize; without infinite negotiation and special pleading, -copious bleeding both of heart and purse, voluminous correspondence, lofty flights of eloquence and poetry, and an incredible amount of pantomime? Who ever- got a bargain, worth talking about, without a corresponding outlay of talk, and fuss, and pulling, and hauling, -and teazing, and a near approach untojfibbing? Is there any transaction in life, from the christen- ing 'of a child, up to the framing of a Constitution, that is not surrounded by an atmosphere of jaw, and intrigue, and clashing interests, and indispen-- sable compromises? Is any good thing ever said, or done, or got at, without a world of toiling, and fighting, and pound-.- ing,: and crushing, and squeezing, and bruising?

Any able-bodied pauper can get up a bouquet of mayweeds, or dandelions, or fill his stomach with blackberries and wild grapes; but those massive, magnificent clusters of Black Hamburtgh,- or- that charming re-tnion of Japonicas, are they to be had without -toil, and skill, and ingenious contrivances, and a shower of guineas?

Not in time, merely, though that was no trifle; -not in scudi, merely, though their name is a good deal more than legion, and their origin too often a sad and guilty one ; but the expenditure of thoughts, and consultations, and discussions, and heart-burn- ings, and strifes, and groans, and sighs, and o'er- strained sinews, and o'er-taxed muscles, alike of man and beast; the analysis would, indeed, be an unpala- table one to human pride and vanity. Only think of the angry disputes that must have occurred, when the clashing plans of so many different archi- tects were submitted, and canvassed; the jealousies, and bitter feuds of the artists themselves; the in- triguing, gerrymandering, squabbling, there must have been, for jobs and contracts, of all kinds.; the delays, annoyances, casualties, that must have been incident to the erection of such a pile. If the Temple of Solomon, not one-tenth as large, nor ope whit more splendid, yet had its three score and ten thou- sand, that bare burdens, and its four score thousand hewers in the mountains, how shall we begin to esti- mate the amount of labor that hath brought this mighty mass together?

It would certainly take an able negotiator, to bring about any thing like a respectable compromise between the two advertise- ments. One can't help thinking, too, that while. the Press is very properly called " the vehicle of truth," some large lies will, notwithstanding, jump up be- hind, to say the least.

Imprison- ment at hard labor; such was the sentence pro- nounced against us, from the beginning. Does not every hour's experience vindicate, alike its wisdom and its justice?

But had it carried everything before it, had it found its way into every library between the two seas, had it been translated into every language un- der heaven, his absurd self-love would not have been satisfied.

When one thinks of our true proportions, our real position, in this goodly frame of things, how over- whelmingly small, nay, pitiful, seem all the pomps and vanities of life.

Alas, if these things-be so, indeed! But then again, can this be the true view of life? Are not these, after all, mere idle, unprofitable fancies, as far removed from the truth, as the absurd exaggerations of self-love? If we should cherish them, would it not be fatal'to all progress? Are they not at war with all true faith, all active virtue? Yes, yes; true humanity, true religion, repudiate both extremes alike; reject alike this frightful belit- tling of man, and human destiny, which would pa- ralyze all honest effort, and turn the world into a mere nest of sensualists and misanthropes, and the monstrous self-glorifications and ridiculous preten- sions of empty-headed vanity.  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC8088-00000124"/> 'TRANSACTIONS OF OUR SOCIETY.

He went for Sen- timent. He had no patience, he said, with this same ,rigid, repulsive, uncompromising Principle.

If mere Principle could have had its way from the beginning, a precious world we would -have had of it, to be sure. It would have begun with cut- ting down all the trees of Paradise, uprooting all its 'lovely flowers, silencing all the music of its :brooks. It would have turned that blessed spot into a, mere wheat-field and kitchen-garden, and have lined all its rivers with flour-mills.

In a word, Mr. President, Principle, if left to itself, would never stop short il its wild career, its Quixotic warfare with the inequalities and miseries of life, till it had robbed that life of all its lustre, fragrance, relish, value. ' Scroggins was just about as violent and ultra on the side of Principle. He too, he said, was sick of that silly, whining, maudlin Sentiment, that was so prevalent in the community. He had no patience with it, any more than with that timid, creeping Conservatism, which, is the enemy of all true pro- gress, all proper development. Yes, Mr. President, he continued, what is this same Sentiment, which the gentleman seeks thus to elevate at the expense of Principle; which he would enthrone in our hearts thus, and regulate our lives by? How much of it can bear inspection? How much of it is resolvable into a mere tickling of the fancy, a mere excitement of the nerves! Spurious trash, fed by silly novels, and worthless pictures, and paltry ballads, and vile plays; co-existing with all manner of folly and vice; keeping company with sickly girls, and feeble witted topers; at best, a mere chasing after butterflies, or devotion unto lap-dogs. How much there is of this sad stuff in the world! How much good feeling, that   TRANSACTIONS OF OUR SOCIETY.    253 only lasts so long as the bottle holds out; how much martial ardor, that expires with the music of the band; how much prayer and praise, even, that is only skin-deep; having no deep and abiding root in the heart, it dies with the last cadence of the speak- er, goes out with the last note of the organ; leading to no heroic exertion, bearing no valuable fruit what- ever. The Sentiment, forsooth, of the epicure, and the voluptuary; of the men, who pervert and de- grade the whole meaning and purpose of life; who as utterly misinterpret the great volume of Nature, as the utilitarian himself does; whom the sparkling brook only reminds of the beaker they so love to drain; who can see nought in the sweet flowers, but the bright eyes, and rosy cheeks of their mistresses. How much of this same Sentiment is there, both in life, and in art, that is a- mere minister unto sensu- ality. How many large dealers in it are there, who never paid a debt, or gave a dollar to charitable uses, in the whole course of their lives. How many sen- timental husbands are there, who, after abusing and humbugging their wives most scandalously, year after year, will sit down and write most tender epi- taphs upon them, when they are gone.

He -could not agree with brother Wiggins, that Principle real- ly sought to turn the world into a mere work-shop, on week days, and a mere Quaker meeting on Sun- 'days; but 'still less could -he agree with brother S-croggtns, in confounding the eternal distinction -that existfs between Sentiment and Sensuality. Oh, -no; true sentiment was a precious, a holy thing; the source of all noble effort; at the foundation of all the great achievements of humanity.  It played a higher part, he thought, than Principle; dealt with the finer, and more delicate tissues of our -moral organization; it had to do with the petals of ,the flower, -while Principle Was busy with "the roots.   TtRANSACTIONS OF OUR SOCIETY.   2"5 What principle was there on earth, so powerful, so valuable to man, as the sentiment of parental, -or filial love? The latter did its glorious work in the heart at once, and thoroughly, while the former picks its way along, carefully -and painfully, and arrives at the same goal at last. But what truer vindication of the superiority of Sentiment could there be, than the simple fact, that the better half of creation are guided almost entirely by it, in their earthly pllgri- -mage? While men are eternally 'discussing, and scolding about Principles, woman listens to nature's -voice within her heart, and while rendering it 'a prompt, cheerful obedience, is at once, far more ser- viceable to her brethren here below, and also travel- ing far more swiftly and surely to the gates of hea- ven, than her imperious lord, with-- all his pride of understanding. Christianity itself; does itnot deal far more with Sentiments than Principles? Does it not appeal far more to our affections than to our un- derstandings'? Love one another, is the glorious sentiment inscribed upon its banners. What are all its doctrines, and mysteries, put together, worth, as guides, compared with this blessed little precept? But, of course, men as usual, perversely prefer, puz- zling their wits with its abstractions, to taking home its commandments to their hearts; prefer squabbling, all day long, about Trinity and Unity, or Cbrisuth-  &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC8088-00000127"/> 256   TRANSACTIONS OF OUR SOCIETY. stantiation and Transubstantiation, and such like subleties, to taking up arms against their own rebel appetites and passions. Ah, if they would only strive to embody the sentiments of the Gospel in their lives, instead of madly seeking to get to the bottom of its principles, the world would be a far more comfortable and delightful one, than was ever devised by reformer, or dreamt of by poet. Muggins differed toto coelo, from the plausible gentleman who had last spoken. It was news, in- deed, to him, that Sentiment had been at the bottom of all the great achievements of men; that the con- duct, which was dictated by the passing emotions of the moment, could be compared at all, as a benefici- ent agent, to that which had been inspired by consci- entious conviction. If Sentiment helped a noble cause along occasionally, it was quite as apt to lend its aid to a doubtful one; nay, it could plead almost as prettily and persusively in behalf of tyranny and priestcraft, as of political and religious liberty. No, no.  All the real hard work, all the true yeoman service to society, had been rendered by Principle. Sentiment alone would hardly have got mankind out of the Nomadic state; Principle has made them what-they are. While Sentiment wastes its breath in vain sighs, and idle aspirations, Principle buckles down to its task, in right earnest; builds and plants,   TRANSACTIONS OF OUR SOCIETY.    257 explores and reforms the world. All the costly sa- crifices that have led to great issues, have been made by Principle; whether Sentiment has sought to cheer it on, or groan it down, has mattered not; unshaken, unseduced, unterrified, it hath still kept on its way, faithfully, unto the glorious end. It was equally new to him, that Christianity dealt far more with sentiments than principles. He had always sup- posed that its greatest appeal was to the consciences of men; that it paid little regard to transient, fugi- tive feelings, but looked to deep-laid, abiding convic- tions, for its triumph over evil; nay, that it insisted upon our surrendering our affections, and our preju- dices, however dear, for the very sake of unpalatable truths, and uninviting paths of duty. Principles, principles, principles ; they were the great and glori- ous things; the foundation-stones of all faith, go- vernment, art, science. And the great men of the world, the representative-men, as they were called, what was it they-represented?  The Washingtons, and Hamiltons, and Marshalls, and Websters, and Channings, wherein consisted their greatness, but in their unflinching, indomitable championship of prin- ciples?

Why strive -to render antagonistic, those things which God had intended to work har-  moniously, gloriously together, for the good of his children?

Let them  labor together in love, then.  Let Principle lay broad and deep, the massive foundations, and let Sentiment carve the   I exquisite capitals and the rich 'entablature of the porticos.

I confess, too, that I thought brother Mug- gins rather over-stated the .point, when he credited Principle with all the great performances on the stage of life; but even allowing it to be so, is-it not reserved for Sentiment to sing the praises -f those mighty deeds? What is the hero, after all, without his poet '! But the Chair would not tax the patience of the members with further illustrations, and would be glad if, under the circumstances, it might beeex- cused from putting the question. Muggiins insist- ing, however, the votaries of Sentiment carried the day, by a decided majority. EULOGY ON WAGGLES. 'Wiggins then read a long, feeling, and, withal, somewhat queer eulogy, on our lamented friend and brother, Waggles. "It must be confessed, that our excellent friend was one of the most eccentric of mortals. H-is:ap- pearance, dress, movements, were all peculiar, .and most emphatically so was his language.

Let me give a few examples thereof. On one occasion, speaking of a certain person, I said, 'Poor fellow, he has gone quite crazy about it.' 'Poor fellow!' he replied, 'oh, no;- the crazy part of life, is the cream of it. At another time, while speaking of an indolent, pleasure-seeking man, he remarked, that Truth might soak in her well for ever, before he'd even throw her a rope. On being asked, once, what was the great motive of his getting married, he replied, with great solemnity, ' By long and assiduous crock- ery-practice, to improve the accuracy of my aim.' Onr being rallied, at another time, about not attend- ing church more regularly, he rejoined, 'Ah, it is indeed a luxury, now ; would you have it degenerate into a mere habit?' Talking with him once, about his portrait, (not an altogether flattering one) and expressing a wish to have it, in case of survivorship, he replied, promptly, ' No, no; the garret is the only place for that daub ;' he added, with a sigh, ' what a comfort it will be to me, to know, that the rats will be nibbling away at the copy, while the worms are lunching upon the original.' I met him, not long ago, coming out of the theatre, with his little son.- I saw by the bills, that they had been playing a flashy melo-drama. I asked him how he was pleased. ' Moderately,' said he; 'a lively piece;   EULOGY ON WAGGLES.      261 a good deal more shooting in it, than talking; and what little talk they gave us, was not what I have, hitherto, been accustomed to consider English. Tom, here, was tickled, though, and so I do not regret the investment.' He once read me part of a letter, which he had just been writing to his wife. It began thus: 'Dear darner of my stockings, re- newer of my buttons, suckler of my babes, and signer of my deeds.' Who, under heaven, but Waggles, would have commenced an epistle in that extraordi- nary style? But I need not farther illustrate the invariable eccentricity of his expressions. The following little incident will show, at once, the oddity and amiability of his character. We were going down Broadway together, one evening. The weather was decidedly cold. Christ- mas was not far off. As we were passing by  , the famous confectioner's, there were three little, ragged beggar-boys, rubbing their frost-bitten noses wistfully against the panes, while gazing, with looks of mingled delight and despair, at the dainty world of sugar-things, within. W. paused, and forthwith assuming a solemn and severe look, marched- up to them, and said, ' You young scamps, how dare you stand here, grinning at the good things? -You'd like to steal the whole concern' I dare say; but I'll serve'you out.'

He. had an unconquerable 'aversion for glossy hats, and brilliant boots.  Patent leather he abhorred. He actually employed, a venerable negro friend, to, wear, every new hat that he purchased, (rarma avesy those purchases!) some three or four weeks, before: he. ventured to show it to the community, in his-own proper person. Old slippers, and greasy night-caps, he delighted in; nor could all his love for Mrs. W. ever induce him to incarcerate himself in straps. HeAi abominated new coats. as much as Ch. Justice ever did; but the mellow lustre which: age gives; to the -sleeve of an, old one, or to the seat, of a veteran pair of. pantaloons, he! greatly affected,; not: from a parsimonious spirit, however, but from a pure. relish for the antique.

Twice a year, he thought, was quite often enough for that tumultuous, that terrible operation. The unthinking have accused him, therein, of downright nastiness. Not so; it was, he said, a love of dignified repose, merely, blended with a proper fellow-feeling for his kindred dust! The financial remains of our esteemed brother, I grieve to say, were the merest trifles. It is to be doubted, indeed, whether he ever knew the blessings of solvency. Too much, alas, of his persuasive elo- quence, that might have been'delighting and instruct- ing us, in Lyceums, was expended upon unfeeling creditors. He evidently had a very slender know- ledge of accounts. His books were not kept in ac- cordance with the rules prescribed in Bennett; nay, were often disfigured with caricatures, broad grins, flying fish, and all manner of monstrosities. It was in- allusion to these un-business-like habits of his, and the constant hot water in which they kept him, that he once playfully requested me, in case I should survive him, to see to it, that the following epitaph was engraven on his tombstone. It is certainly a peculiar one. Of Nature's duly settled debt, This stone doth stand, as the receipt, The only debt that e'er was paid By the sad dog who here is laid.   EULOGY ON WAGGLES.      265 The literary remains of our brother are numerous. Nine-tenths of them, it must be confessed, are simply absurd. The other tenth, I can't help thinking, has something in it. I am confident, that the members of this Society will agree with me, and will do all that in them lies, towards sending it handsomely down, even to the remotest posterity! Our dear friend, -as is well known, attributed his last illness to his over-exertions in endeavoring to discover the jokes in ---'s new comedy. It was, indeed, an arduous task; quite too arduous for a man of the delicate constitution of Waggles. But for that unhappy affair, he might, perhaps, have been with us this very evening, cracking his own jokes; and I have been spared the melancholy satisfaction of pronouncing his eulogy! Peace to his ashes!" The Society then adjourned to its customary creatuitre-comfortsV  &#xD;<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC8088-00000132"/> TRAVELERS' FANCIES. I STUMBLED on my old friend    , this morn- ing.' He has just returned from California. While away, he thought he would also drop in, he said, and take a friendly peep at some of the most interesting islands of the Pacific. He came near paying dearly for his curiosity, at one of the Fee-jee Group. In spite' of the "remonstrances of the captain, he wan- dered off alone, some miles from the steamer, when he was suddenly confronted with quite a pleasant little party of the natives. Nothing, he says, but the timely exhibition of a revolver, saved him from being served up, that very day, in soups, steaks, and sand- wiches. On his retreat to the vessel,l he picked up a document, which, to him, was altogether unintelli- gible, but which a French gentleman on board, was savant enough to translate into his own language. It turned out to be a Carte d Manger of the IslanId The following were some of the items in it: Deux petits missionaires, au naturel. Mayonnaise de Methodiste. Un Jean Bull. saute dans sa glace.

He was fond enough of a fib, before he turned traveler. And to think, that he has been less than three months, making this extensive tour, including a fort- night's stop at San Francisco, on his return!

But suppose'that there might be Disunion, with- out all these attendant perils, disasters, and disgra- ces, and merely looking at the matter, as travelers; what monstrous inconveniences, and discomforts, would such a state of things give rise to? Suppose we had thirty-one independent powers here, each with its own Custom-House Regulations, and Pass- port System; what an intolerable nuisance would a trip from Boston to Baltimore, for instance, be turn- ed into. We might start off, to be sure, very plea- santly from that commodious, and well ordered depot in Boston; we might rattle on for an hour, even, with considerable self-satisfaction, till the Rhode-Island frontier aroused us from our meditations, or friendly chat. Here the first grand turn-out would come off, for the inspection of luggage, and the vidimizazione of passports. The functionaries of that mighty State would not fail to be on the ground, in full force. There  &#xD;<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC8088-00000135"/> 272     TRAVELERS' FANCIES. would, of course, be considerable delay, some grum- bling, some attempts at bribery and corruption, and a fair share of profanity; In due time, we should all, including the usual proportion of women, chil- dren, aged, and infirm, be fairly re-established in the cars, and rattle cozily on, for another hour or so, till tle -romantic frontier'of Connecticut hove in sight. Falling here into the clutches of another score or two of officials, the same solemnities, with a corres- ponding outlay of cash, breath, and temper, would be repeated; most probably at Stonington. In conse- quence of the delays thus occasioned, the boats, in- stead of leaving at 8 P. M., would leave at 2 A. M. The business-passenger would not be spending the -next day in Wall street, as now, but highly relishing the sublime scenery of the Sound. And when we arrived at the great Metropolis, instead of merely having to fight our way through an army of hack- drivers to our respective hotels and- lodgings, (itself, ,no great joke to the nervous, or invalid traveler,) we should have the added enjoyments, that the vis-4ing of passports, and the examination of bag- gage, never fail to bring. Similar entertainments would, of course, come off at Jersey City, West Trenton, Philadelphia, Frenchtown, Elkton, and Baltimore; the whole resulting, in the addition of, heaven knows how many- hours, dollars, cares, and   TRAVELERS' FANCIES.      273 vexations, to a trip, which is even noun, by no means paradisaical in its character. How long, pray, would people submit to these things? Mere regard to comfort and convenience, then, were there no higher considerations involved, would surely prevail to keep us together. Thank heaven, and the glorious workmen, who fabricated our political system, the idea of pulling it to pieces is about as visionary as it is monstrous. Every hour seems to be diminishing the force of sec- tional influences, and more and more consolidating the mighty mass.

Are we not all Americans, living under the same, Constitution, and fighting under the same Flag, talk- ing the same blessed- language, having the same glo- rious Past to inspire us, the same majestic Future to cheer us on?

What the alterative properties of the waters, alongside of the attractive properties of the place itself? This grand coming together from North, South, East, and West; this pleasant encounter of wits, and interchange of civilities and sentiments, who can estimate its value aright, as a bond ofiunion, and as a means of speeding along the 'All hail hereafter,' which Providence hath in store or us? Magnificent future, indeed, if we will only cling together, like brethren; -if we will only act in a calm, wise, conciliatory spirit t Andc yet, I must take leave to doubt, whether all the sketches, which a too lively fancy has above por- trayed, will be turned into realities, under the most auspicious circumstances. I do not believe, for in- \stance, that any descendant of mine will ever write on to the landlord of the Great Bear Lake Hotel, to secure- apartments for himself and bride; or that he will ever overtake a fugitive trunk at the Bherings Straits Depot.     -EXPLIGATIO    APOLO GETICA. I was thinking, just now, while looking over some of the above pages, whether, in case my. soul were to be suddenly, and unceremoniously, turned out of its present lodgings, it would be altogether the thing to leave such a record behind me., It is barely possi- ble, that some indiscreet friend or kinsman, survey- ing it through the magnitying-glass of friendship. or affection, might, in an unguarded moment, be injudi- ciqus enough to lay it before an already sufficiently tried community. These whims of mine, poor things, how hardly it would fare with them, if it were so, in- deed! The cruel critics would show them no quar- ter. Yes, I fancy I hear already, the hisses of their sneers, and feel the pangs of their merciless sar- casms. Loudest and sharpest of the sibilant crew, would he that terrible Annihilator. "The volume in question, is an outrageous attempt, alike upon the purse, time, and temper of the reader. It was bad enough to have thought such things; would have been sufficiently inexcusable to have given them breath; but, as to deliberately commit- ting them to paper, and then insulting the public  &#xD;<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC8088-00000137"/> 276    EXPLICATIO APOLOGETICA. with them, it is alike inconceivable, and monstrous. How any self-respecting publisher could have had a hand in the affair; how any compositors, not at star vation's door, could have consented to be participes criminis in any such transaction, is a puzzler, in- deed! But we will waste no more time on such trash. It will find its own way, rapidly enough, to an ignoble oblivion, without auxiliary kick of ours." Pleasant, that! And that cruel Crusher. We have no patience with such a book as this; a mere bundle of whims, conceits, and affectations. It is-neither reverent, nor respectful, in its style, is utterly without method in its arrangement, and, to crown all,.it neither announces a single important fact, nor gives a solitary valuable truth to the com- munity. On the contrary, it is stuffed with far-fetch- ed fibs, impertinent jokes, and abominably outlandish expressions. What business has a writer thus to dress his thoughts in harlequin attire?. If they have any real merit or dignity in them, why not let them go modestly clad? If not, why call our attention to their emptiness and folly, by such mountebank de- vices?, Out upon such absurd productions, say we." And then the Literary Law- Giver. "We can never consent to set the seal of our ap- probation upon such a performance; a mere incon-   EXPLICATIO APOLOGETICA.     2;? gruous medley of crudties, and extravagancies. So unreliable, too. The author is eternally contradict- ing himself, alike- in his opinions, and his humors. Ifhe begins with a song, he is sure to conclude-with, a sermon, and vice versa. Society, we think, would have been no: loser, had the time employed in putting this farrago together, been dedicated to the shaking of carpets, or to agricultural exercises." That quiet, malicious Satirist, too: "1 We see nothing substantial, or valuable here; nothing that will live. The-author may succeed in raising a laugh now and then; but neither his jokes, nor his lame attempts at the pathetic, will ever reach the hearts of his readers. Itf is, indeed, a superficial piece of work. If the author ever gets hold of a good thought, he never follows it out, to any useful pur- pose, but is straightway seduced away from it, by the very first grotesque image that flits across his fancy, the very first flower of -rhetoric, that he stumbles over in his wanderings." Ah, there is too much truth, I fear, in this last criticism, however ungracious--may be its spirit. Now, is it worth while to expose one's self, either wilfully, or negligently, to such cruel assaults? Why forsake a quiet fireside, and a snug obscurity, and deliberately invite the peltings and piercings of stony-hearted critics?

Alas, even church-yards have their cynics, and their snarlers; men, who come not to offer tears, or prayers, or tri- butary flowers, but to desecrate the holy place, with their jibes, and mean-spirited sarcasms; nay, to find materials for their gall-dipped pens! Let me take no such risks, then, but commit forth- with to the flames, these And yet, on second thoughts, hadn't I better get that fascinating little kinswoman of mine to make them up into Allumettes? I love to see her pretty young fingers plying their tasks so cunningly. She manufactures them  with such an air, too, and with such marvellous velocity! It shall be so. In that shape, these poor fancies of mine, will at least, minister unto needful illumina- tion; whereas, in their present whimsical one, they may only lead to idle mirth, or unprofitable MYS- TIFICATION!! , .,   EXPLANATORY STATE-MENT. THE inditer of the above Fancies seems to have had a prophetic foreboding of the sad,- strange fate, that was so speedily to overtake him. That whim- sical soul of his, was, indeed, most " suddenly and unceremoniously " sent for; and what is truly extra- ordinary, its queer tenement, along with it. But the following brief narrative will explain all. Six little weeks ago, and before carrying out his fell purpose of converting his precious MS. into segar-and-candle-lighters, the learned author started for Albany, embarking in one of the opposition boats. When last seen, he was in the act of tendering to the clerk thereof, the amount of his passage-money, be- ing the round sum of six and a quarter cents. The prominent, and avowed motive, indeed, of his- making the voyage, was to try a psychological experiment upon himself. He was anxious, he said, to see whe- ther the scenery of the river could possibly retain its mingled beauty and grandeur, in the eyes of a  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC8088-00000139"/> 280    EXPLANATORY STATEMENT. traveler, whose mind was oppressed by the ever- present conviction that he was paying such a price for the privilege! Would not the ludicrous little- ness of the consideration-money, necessarily impart a corresponding littleness and meanness to the ever- shifting landscape? Aed -to such an absurd whim as this was his invaluable life sacrificed! When abreast of Coxsackie, the boat which was conveying him, and some nine hundred others, lovers of the picturesque, and haters of monopoly, to their destination, saw fit to indulge itself in the luxury, (an unusual one, certainly, in our waters,) of an ex- plosion; both starboard and larboard boilers parti- cipating therein. Instantly, some three hundred tourists, (the ill-fated writer of the preceding pages, among them,) were blown into the air, and have never since: descended, or been heard from. The adjacent counties. have been faithfully searched, but no traces of them have been discovered. Whether they have alighted in some of the great lakes, or in -the broad Paific, or among the astonished antipodes, or whether their bodies are even now, whirling uni comfortably through ether, are questions too "horri- bly painful, and mysterious to dwell upon! In this sad state! of things, the editor, being alike friend, and kinsman, and executor of the dear depart- ed  i hath ventured, notwithstanding the deprecatory   281    EXPLANATORY STATEMENT. tone assumed by him on the last page of his immor- tal manuscript, to lay it before the world. He will simply add, that in so doing, he feels that he is con- ferring an unbounded favor, not only on his own con- temporaries, but on a long, long series of delighted and edified ages to come!
