INTRODUCTI2&#xD;
The year 181constitited an important ris s in the io r&#xD;
of Ohio. The war of this period, opened to ems tio s.nd&#xD;
enterprise, the  great area west'   6the Alle  es. The&#xD;
ai-mies st out to battle with Indians ad other"  ofs,fo e&#xD;
banksa of the Wabash, theIllinois, the Detrotth  e4 t&#xD;
Miami of the Lakes, and other rivers, opened forobsevatiod,&#xD;
attractive scenes for settlement.&#xD;
Ohio particularly, at this period, was looked 'upon as the&#xD;
garden of the West, Prior tos the war but few setttments.&#xD;
had been made in the North-Western region: but as soon as&#xD;
peace was made, a coxitinual tide of emigration was seen&#xD;
moving westward.&#xD;
At the period of the opening of on narrative, the territory&#xD;
now comprised in Richla~nd Ahland, and Morarw counties,&#xD;
was almost an unbroken wilderness. Th  present .h}i-rng&#xD;
City of Mansfield then contained only two or three }cabins and&#xD;
a couple of block houses, which were erected in the tonth&#xD;
of September of this year. There was also a cabin on the&#xD;
Barkdoll farm, and a block house at Beams now C  bell')&#xD;
mill., There *ere  few farms opened along the' B a k  irk,&#xD;
and a few at Lexington, and along the Clear Fok' Supplies&#xD;
of provisions &amp;amp;c., were',lpacked fromi Mt.  Veron Knox&#xD;
county, on horseback, a feat attended  ith no' rte : nger&#xD;
as the wilderness then was tenanted 'by Ili ns and wil&#xD;
beasts.&#xD;
The Indian tribes holding possession of Ohio at this t'wer&#xD;
were the Shawnees, Wyandots, Miamis, Pinkashaws,      1S a+&#xD;
wares, Eries, Winnebagoes, and some portions of the, '&#xD;
Nations. The Shawnees are said to be the oldest inhabitants&#xD;
this State.&#xD;

INTRODUCTION.&#xD;
Among the tribes which inhabited this region of Ohio,&#xD;
were the Delawares and Wyandots. A settlement of Dela-&#xD;
wares existed at Greentown, on the Black Fork, and one at&#xD;
Jeromerille, now in Ashland county. These Indians professed&#xD;
friendship for thewhites, andi up t01 18'2they had lived&#xD;
amicably with 14hni.&#xD;
Among the Indian chiefs friendly to the American cause,&#xD;
was Captain'Pipe of Jeromeville, who previous to the treaty&#xD;
of Greenville in -79,was the most inveterte enemy ofrthe&#xD;
whites.        .&#xD;
Tecumerih his b    her the Prohet were the leadingi&#xD;
s'p's arrae          against the ew 4e settlement ,a&#xD;
tlroe their influence many a cheerful cabin hearth was&#xD;
made desolate&#xD;

sters flitted from branch to branch, pouring&#xD;
forth their morning _songs, and the wild bee&#xD;
basked in the sunlight, now sipping the nectar&#xD;
from the flowers, and now alighting upon some&#xD;
pendant leaf to pick a dainty morsel. Every ob-&#xD;
ject around the young hunter was filled with beau-&#xD;
ty, and inspired his -soul with the most pleasing&#xD;
emotions, and every sound that fellrupon his ear&#xD;
was filled with diFinest, sweetestinelody.&#xD;
Philip was one of the most powerful and athlet-&#xD;
ic men of his day. None ventured to cope with&#xD;
him in wrestling, or in other feats of strength.-&#xD;
His countenance wasradiant with the genial smiles&#xD;
of a warm and generous heart, while his bright&#xD;
eye flashed with the impulse of a noble and manly&#xD;
courage. He was the only son, the joy and pride&#xD;
of his parents, who bestowed every care their means&#xD;
afforded upon his moral and intellectual culture.&#xD;
His parents were old and infirm, and the duty of&#xD;
supporting them in their declining yearsageyoling&#xD;

dearly did he love this:wild and exciting life. H'is&#xD;

instantly with the discharge of Philip's rice,rang&#xD;
the sharp crack of another through the forest, the&#xD;
bail of which struck the tree a few 'inches below&#xD;
where Philip's rifle rested. At this sudden ated&#xD;
unlooked for report, Philip started to his feet,aid&#xD;
looking in the direction from which the sou d pro..&#xD;
ceeded, discovered a savage, about one, htindred&#xD;
yards from him in an opposite dir section acio'wthe&#xD;
swamp, on a small elevation, which' for soire dis-&#xD;
tance overlooks the swamp.&#xD;
Philip on seeing the savage sprang behind a&#xD;
tree, and re-loaded with the utmost speed. The&#xD;
Indian on seeing him thus preparing for ntaien&#xD;
counter with. him, threw down his rifle and tona-&#xD;
hawk, and holding up his hands, ran towardshimt&#xD;
with as niuch haste as possible, exclaiming; appa-&#xD;
rently much frightened--" Me no shoot you! me&#xD;

Philip lowered his rifle,.and the Indiary coming&#xD;

sistance in' securing Philip's prize. Philip, pre-&#xD;
terilng that his suspicions were removed, accepted&#xD;
it; and' such portions of the bear %as were of' value&#xD;
were conveyed to Philip's cabin.  A good supper&#xD;
s prepared for Kanotche by Kate, Philip's sister,&#xD;
and the 'Indian departed.&#xD;
IKate Seymour was an only daughter,-a rosy&#xD;
cheeked, bright eyed lass, just =eighteen, of a gay,&#xD;
laughing',disposition, whose glances were incendiai&#xD;
vies,:dangerous to the peace of the gallant swains&#xD;
who came within their range.&#xD;
yfer tha departure of the Indian, Philip narra-&#xD;
ted the adventures-of the day. " I tell you, Kate,"&#xD;
said he, in a lively tone, "Old Kanotche was 'a good&#xD;
medicine for bad blood about that time, he started&#xD;
:h circulation a little more -lively than I ever felt&#xD;
lyfo e."&#xD;
:Ah, but Phil, I'm afraid he meant you no good.&#xD;
Ilon't 'believe it was a mistake."&#xD;
:Teith  do I," said Mrs. Seymour: I do wish,&#xD;
Mr.Saymour, you'would take us all up to Mansfield&#xD;
till the war is over. Those Indians are so treach-&#xD;
e,L don't feel safe.&#xD;
hh! pooh! mother," said Mr. Seymour, "don't&#xD;

&#xD;
fully, "if you had been shot? How thankful I am&#xD;
you are safe."&#xD;
" Oh-Harry would take my place, you know.-&#xD;
you would not miss me."  And Philip looked at&#xD;
Kate roguishly, and she blushing, jumped up and&#xD;
playfully boxed his ears. Philip dodged, and they&#xD;
were just getting into one of their pleasant frolics&#xD;
when the door opened, and before the astonished&#xD;
family stood a young emigrant to Ohio,&#xD;

Henry Monroe was a young Pennsylvanian Ffrom&#xD;
the same neighborhood whence the Seymours had'&#xD;
come   Many a day he had swung Kate upon the&#xD;
gr  ie swing, near the school house, and many&#xD;
an  a prudent lad he had punished for presuming&#xD;
to claim any of Kate's attentions. Thus they grew&#xD;
u    ' together;- of her he dreamed day and night,&#xD;
a id when Kate's parents noved to Ohio, he of all&#xD;
others suffered most at parting. Nor was this re-&#xD;
gaid unrepaid, for Kate actually thought, him the&#xD;
 bravest and handsomest boy in school, except&#xD;
hilip  Since the removal of the Seymours to&#xD;
hio, Henry had suinoned courage sufficient&#xD;
to write a letter to Philip, but somehow or oth-&#xD;
er itvas al to or about Kate, so that Philip threw&#xD;
&#xD;
itito her slap and saidThere Kate, I did not&#xD;
mean to open your letter, but 2ank misdir ptedit!"&#xD;
Andof .course, as Philip would not answer it, com-&#xD;
on -politeness required Kate to write d say&#xD;
something in reply, and so *ery thought hemyst&#xD;
avsyer; Kate's kind lette', and thsu letters  d&#xD;
pased fersorne months,until Henry thought it49pk&#xD;
too much writing to say so little, and so one day&#xD;
he packed his knapsack, strapped it .on li back&#xD;
and battedd for Ohio, witl enough' mony to eer&#xD;

peering over the bank. Presently one- of theirs&#xD;
cautiouly drew himself up and examined Henry's&#xD;
caup. Satisfied that there had been but one per-&#xD;
0x1 in the camp and that he was quietly sleeping,&#xD;
both took deliberate 'aim at the supposed sleeper&#xD;
and fired. Up to this instant Henry was quite&#xD;
nervous, but now his nerves were as firm as steel,&#xD;
and as the Indians sprang-forward with wild whoops&#xD;
andraised tomahawks hey shot the first through the&#xD;
head' and before 'the second could recover from his&#xD;
ast nistre't 'he dealt him'ia blow oveir the scaip&#xD;

fell but sprang ipand staggered to the bank where&#xD;
arsecond blow from Henry knocked himinto the&#xD;
rapid current. This first experience of life in the&#xD;
wilderness,'nst effectually drove' sleep from&#xD;
Heny. He strapped his knapsack and following&#xD;

travd1ld steadily by the tail, as 'he supposed,&#xD;
until daylight, when to his alarm he found,?that he&#xD;
lost. -He had wandered away from the iver,&#xD;

he now found to Abe oly1 i his imagination. Most&#xD;
anxiously he sought the river but found no sign.-&#xD;
At the rising of the: spin. he set his face directly&#xD;

"He eat alone,&#xD;
And silent, on a fallen tree,&#xD;
And, gazed upon&#xD;
The waters gliding by."&#xD;
lOQR several days subsequent to the&#xD;
JLevents narrated in the previous&#xD;
chapter, Phil p7' Seymour made it his&#xD;
business to traerseathe country for&#xD;
og around for the purpose of ascer-&#xD;
taing thedposition of the Indians and&#xD;
the probabiKties of their making an at-,&#xD;
ktasck Un the settlements; but so far&#xD;
as he could learn" all 'danger' had disap-&#xD;
peared, and Philip began to flatter him-&#xD;
self that his fears had been groundless,&#xD;
and that he had in fact' entirely misin-&#xD;
terpreted the occurrences which had&#xD;
previously excited his suspicions.&#xD;
Henry Monroe in 'the 'meantime had made a for-&#xD;
m aTproffer of his heart and hand'to the gentle&#xD;
Kate, and was now  n accepted lover. The. time&#xD;
for the wedding was appointed, and Henry having&#xD;
made a purchase of a quarter of land, on the ,Black&#xD;
Fork, a short distance below the Seymours', where-&#xD;
upn tor settle with hisbride, returned to his friends&#xD;

2T&#xD;
&#xD;
for a final emigration to his new home in the wil-&#xD;
derness.&#xD;
On the day. following the- departure of Henry,&#xD;
Philip, anxious for another adventure in the woods,&#xD;
and  feeling lonesome in the absence of his friend,&#xD;
took up his rifle, and bidding the family good morn-&#xD;
iug, sallied out into the wilderness justas the un&#xD;
was appearing in all its golden glory.&#xD;
F or hours Philip wandered through the forest&#xD;
without finding any object worthy of his attention:&#xD;
There was anabundance of inferior game in-the&#xD;
woods but this did .not come within the purview of&#xD;
this dlay's adventure. He wished to have another&#xD;
encounter with a'bear, wolf, or wild cat, but oild&#xD;
not get a glimpse of any of these.&#xD;
-   gSomewhat fatigued and weary,Philip at length&#xD;
sat himself down upon the green banks of the mur-&#xD;
muring stream that flowed through the forest,,ind&#xD;
for ,a while sat gazing in a dreamy listk  less&#xD;

THE MURDER OF GIBBS AN] BUEL.&#xD;
"'Twas death to tarry, and 'twd*ath to fly&#xD;
Death bared his weapon, with 'terrific alight&#xD;
And all was desolation."-ANNYiious.&#xD;
Before following up 'the adventures of" Ruffner,&#xD;
on the evening he left the cabin .of Seymour, we&#xD;
propose to lay before the reader a condensed his-&#xD;
tory of the murder referred to in the preceding&#xD;
chapt '&#xD;
Tw :buners -named Gibbs: and  hel Itad built&#xD;
then        small log cabin, bout one mile from&#xD;
Sand     bay,ft bout;one mil-3.S ]: I ofte present&#xD;

West ,        1 l prairieaPnaid.was srrounded&#xD;

esreaine         so    tie t'happy in their wild&#xD;
pursuits.&#xD;
TWo Indians named Omic and Semo, belonging&#xD;
to th'e Ottawa tribe, frequently passed by this cab-&#xD;
i, 'on their way to'the mouth of the Huron river,&#xD;
where they exchanged their venison and furs for&#xD;
powder, lead, tobacco, whiskey &amp;amp;c. -Forming an&#xD;
actaintance with Gibbs and Bue!, they made this&#xD;
asbin their stopping place over night-. One night&#xD;
lbout, two o'clock, these savages came to this cabin&#xD;
highly intoxicated, zkaaking a tremendous. uproar,&#xD;
&#xD;
PIONEER UrE&#xD;
and demanding admittance, but fearing thtthey&#xD;
would kee up their noise all night;,theyere a4&#xD;
mitted. As soon as they had got insigethey conr&#xD;
menced a general "pow wow."     Gibbs orde d&#xD;
them to keep quiet or quit the cabi  Th     i-&#xD;
sed to do either. Whereupon theyjwere knoie,&#xD;
down and dragged out.&#xD;
The Indians 'then withdrew from the 'house, and&#xD;
nothing was heard of them for one or t7o: days}&#xD;
when they returned perfectly sober, and in a friend-&#xD;
ly manner, making no allusion to their former&#xD;
treatment; this was done to remove all suspsiown a&#xD;
to their intentions. They returned again in thp&#xD;
night of the same day, and requested  permission&#xD;
to stay all night, which was 'immed el granted&#xD;
as before.  Gibbs and Iuel went to bed, ra  e&#xD;

of blood about it. He entered the cabin, and the&#xD;
firstobjeut which met his astonished gaze was the&#xD;
body of Bue which had been thrown head fore-&#xD;
nost,,downa kind of cellar in the riddle of the&#xD;
loor, his feet projecting abov . He immediately&#xD;
returned to the settlement, and communicated his&#xD;
discovery to the settlers, whereupon a party of&#xD;
eight oiten set out in pursuit of the murderers,&#xD;
first stopping at the ill-fated cabin.&#xD;
An examination of the body of Buel, revealed&#xD;
the f-act of his head being split open-his legs bro-&#xD;
ken, and the point of a spear still remaining in his&#xD;
head. The company who knew the Indians 'recol-&#xD;
lected that 'Omic usually carried a spear with him&#xD;
while on his trading expeditions to 'Huron. They&#xD;
extracted the spear from the head 'of Buel, preser-&#xD;
vig it for future reference. A .search for the&#xD;
body oftGibbs now commences. They soon discov-&#xD;
ered his trail acting him by his blood' and foot&#xD;
prints.] From the incredible distance of his leaps,&#xD;
he= ab eyidntly much frightened. his body was&#xD;
found aceorssthe prairie, about sixty 'rods'in front&#xD;
of thee  i on the edge of the underbrush. A&#xD;
ball ha4 e ttredhis' bak and lodged in his left&#xD;
beast.  lihiarms were nearly cut off, and he&#xD;
was otherwise dreadfully mangled. The ball was&#xD;
takenfro his body and also preserved&#xD;
The next adventure was to obtain a clue to the~&#xD;
4iyrderers. It was knownthat these Indians had&#xD;
ofn -ldgeddwith Gibbs and Buel, and : the point&#xD;
o theperi3found in the head of Buel, resembled&#xD;
the one carriedbyrQmic. :These considerations&#xD;
ue   the company to fasten their susicions.&#xD;
upon Seno and Omic.&#xD;
".      .iey Were consequently pursued to the mouth&#xD;

W     hites ezept on, secr-eted themselves,&#xD;
hiethis 'one w11iwas well acquainted with the&#xD;
rins,"wnt up the'eiiver to where Semo and Omic&#xD;
&#xD;
resided.  He found Omic a short distanceup the&#xD;
river, having in his possession the remaining part&#xD;
of the spear, with which he had killed Buel. He&#xD;
succeeded in persuading him down the river, under&#xD;

tion; 'and at .the, moment he reached the, spot&#xD;
where the' boat-lay, the secreted'party sprung up,&#xD;
on him, and secured him with ropes. He was taken&#xD;
to Cleveland, tried, found guilty, and executed.&#xD;
Semo was next demanded of his tribe. At first&#xD;
they refused to give hin up, but on being satisfied&#xD;
of his guilt they.consented to do so. 'A delegation&#xD;
was sent to receive him. The savage on finding&#xD;
that he was to be delivered into the hands of his&#xD;
enemies, asked permission to say a few words to&#xD;
the company. It was granted him; and he arose.&#xD;
He was a tall, well built man,-and somewhat grace-&#xD;
ful in his movements. Every eye was fixed upon&#xD;
him, and every ear was open to heArwhat 'he 'had&#xD;
to say.&#xD;
"My brothers," said the savage  me    Gibbs&#xD;
with my pistol-me kill many pale face n.ekill&#xD;
more if me could. You say Sem     u    with&#xD;
white man. Semo no gohe no want        g-he&#xD;

Then casting his dark ,iercing ee4     Qpon&#xD;
the whites who sat sole Aistance ;froniIire he&#xD;
stood, he paused for a moment. The'glance of hip&#xD;
eye was fearfully wild, and his grave and sullen&#xD;
countenance, gave indications of his cchamitting&#xD;
some act of desperation. He drew from his bes~m&#xD;
his pistol. A death like silence pervaded ti~e as-&#xD;
sembly. Fearing that his vengeance wasp aboutto .&#xD;
fall upon some one present, the Indians around'him&#xD;
were about to rush upon him to, disarm biu&#xD;
seeing the movement, Semo discharged hi'wIapon&#xD;
a frightful yell, and a sudden bound into 4ba 4&#xD;

RUFFNER ADVENTURES, WITH WOLVES.&#xD;

It was late inrthe afternoon when Ruffner1 started&#xD;
s"4  "for home. He proceededslowly through the w&#xD;

Tall thick 'grass and weeds grew around its maggin&#xD;
and various kinds of serpents and wild beasts were&#xD;

As ourhero was 'nearing this, horrible looking&#xD;
place, his. attention was aroused by a singular con-&#xD;
fusion of sounds. He paused, andlistened a teg-&#xD;

&#xD;
over the forest. Advancing cautiously a short dis-&#xD;
tance further, the sounds became more audible.&#xD;
"Py tam," mentally ejaculated the Dutchman, as&#xD;
a loud yell broke upon his ears, "vbolvs py shupi-&#xD;
ter." In an instant another frightfully mingled&#xD;
howl rent the air, some distance in the. forest be-&#xD;
hind him, which was answered by those in the&#xD;
swamp with no less unmusical vehemence. Ruffner&#xD;
was alone- darkness was around him, and a fearful&#xD;
foe under cover of. that dyakness had, surrounded&#xD;
him.&#xD;
Nearer and still nearer came the advancing band&#xD;
of midnight marauders, and at every bound their&#xD;
horrible yells broke in upon the forest. It was&#xD;
evident that the pursuing gang had scented his&#xD;
tracks. As the yellsof this gang were borne to&#xD;
those in, te swamp, the latter answered with no&#xD;
les appalling sour d  Ruffner's indecision at this&#xD;
critical period' was but momentary, he sprang into&#xD;
the branches:of a tree standing a few steps from&#xD;
him, but''scarcely had he secured this position,&#xD;
when the whole gang surrounded the tree, and in a&#xD;
inoment were joined by thosein'te swamp. Then'&#xD;
commenced- scene of howling grd yelling which&#xD;
bdfiles all description. Not lessthan tW  score of&#xD;
these loathsome and nsightly creaturesimingled&#xD;
theirwild yells in '"horrid'harmony."   it ap-&#xD;
peared to R4ner, that every onmoment their yelling&#xD;
grew louderfndmore horrio"    occasionally they&#xD;
would make theiost desperateleaps towards the&#xD;
branches of the tree as if determined to spring&#xD;
upon their intended victim, and' devour' him 'soul&#xD;
and body. But finding that they could not succeed'&#xD;
in their attempts,' they became'more furious; and&#xD;
their yells more "horrible at every failure. But&#xD;
tfitl they would not leave the spot.&#xD;
'Riie h sataitiong the"branches of the tree&#xD;
looking down upon the heart-chilling scene around&#xD;
him. The glaring eyeballs~ of the infuriated band&#xD;
&#xD;
of wild beasts, shone like :coals of fire,.as they&#xD;
prowled around the tree,naking night hideous With&#xD;
their wild orgies. Thus, l.e sat for some Morgents;&#xD;
he was beyond their reaeh but not ou of their&#xD;
sight and hearing. At first.our hero was somewhat&#xD;
agitated, but finding himself beyond the power of&#xD;
their devouring jaws he became enraged.&#xD;
"Vot," said he, half. aloud, "Vill, these  evilish&#xD;
puggars schase me on ter dree,un den keep up ter&#xD;
voolish parking it a noise more as like vild tevils?&#xD;
Py schings I vill shtop some of ter troats."&#xD;
Examining his "bouch," he found it well supplied&#xD;
with bullets. He then commenced to open his&#xD;
battery from the tree, firing upon them at every&#xD;
opportunity with much success. On the first fire&#xD;
a death yell from one of their number told that the&#xD;
ball had taken effect. In this way he kept up his&#xD;
fire till near midnight. After he had. killed aid&#xD;
wounded several of them,- they retreated to a&#xD;
greater distance from the tree, still keeping up a&#xD;
continuous howling, It was near the hour of mid-&#xD;
night, and the moon was just pushing up her&#xD;
modest face, before the wolves showed any signs&#xD;
of retreating. But at length their howling died&#xD;
away in the distance.&#xD;
The moon had now begun to cast her light upon&#xD;
the forest. Ruffner descended, and on examina-&#xD;
tion found he had actually shot ten of the*number,&#xD;
some of which were not dead; these he instantly&#xD;
dispatched, and taking theit acalps proceeded on&#xD;
his way to his cabin, where. he arrived in a short&#xD;
time. Next morning he visitedthe spot where he&#xD;
encountered the wolves, and found by the traces of&#xD;
blood and other marks that he had wounded prob-&#xD;
ably as many as he had killed. Returning to his&#xD;
cabin, he remained there a few days making.. pre-&#xD;
parations for the proposed 'hunting gxcursioncl&#xD;

This region, at the time ,of which we write, was&#xD;
beautifully wild and romantic, containing an abun-&#xD;
dance of wild game. Bears, wolves, wild cats deer&#xD;
and raccoons, were more numerous here than in&#xD;
any other region of the country; this was owing&#xD;
to the greater abundance of rocky dens and deep&#xD;
ravines, affording them  a more secure retreat.&#xD;
Philip was much pleased at the location,, and ex-&#xD;
pressed his determination to make this a camping&#xD;

answer this question. It is enough for us to know&#xD;
that just such occurences as we have related are by&#xD;
no means rare in the experiences of pioneer life.--&#xD;
Many such instances are left upon record in the&#xD;
lives of western hunters. We could mention sev-&#xD;
eral, but will not presume upon the intelligence of&#xD;
the reader.&#xD;
After our heroes had despatched the two ser-&#xD;
pents as already mentioned, they proceeded to the&#xD;
shanty, which they had forsaken in the evening.&#xD;
Here they were no little astonished at finding that&#xD;
they had actually taken shelter upon a den of rat-&#xD;
tlesnakes; for on removing the shanty and clearing&#xD;
away the rubbish, their ears were greeted with the&#xD;
music of this species of the snake family. The bat-&#xD;
tie soon commenced in earnest, and for two long&#xD;
hours were our heroes engaged in killing enormous&#xD;
reptiles.  Philip showed himself a master hand&#xD;
at the business, and Ruffner fairly roared with&#xD;
laughter, at witnessing the dexterity of the snake.&#xD;
hating Philip, and every now and then amusing&#xD;
him with some Dutch drollery.&#xD;
Assoon as the work of snake extermination had&#xD;
b een completed, the two hunters continued th eir&#xD;
journey down the banks of the Clear. Fork, until&#xD;
they arrived at the spot where Newville now stands.&#xD;

HUNTING EXCURSION -INDIAN CABIN-AN ADVENTURE.&#xD;
 "Oh let me climb those gay clad hills,&#xD;
Rough,.ruygged though they be,&#xD;
And nestle by the shady rills,&#xD;
Or'neath the shady tree.&#xD;
Ascending the high cliff which overlooks thiM&#xD;
village, the romantic Philip set himself down ug'n&#xD;
a moss covered rock.&#xD;
The morning was beautiful and all nature looked&#xD;
gay and smiling. The mingled melodies of a hpmu&#xD;
sand songsters, rang upon' the morning air, To&#xD;
Philip, the scene appeared the: more delightiu as&#xD;
he contrasted it with the dreamy horrors of4the&#xD;
past night. Philip's anticipations of the grand and&#xD;
beautifull were fully realized. Below him was spread,&#xD;
ouf the interminable forest-the variegated land-&#xD;
scape. He had left Ruffner in the valley below, and&#xD;
he was now by himself on the'highest point of the&#xD;
bluff, free ,to revel in his own imaginations..&#xD;
"The forest, the mighty forest ! howit inspires&#xD;
the mind with emotions too big for utterance  ,&#xD;
Thousands and thousands of acres, covered with&#xD;
the most luxuriant Negetation through which brigh-&#xD;
sparkling waters roll; and on whose banlds are saa&#xD;
the blending colors of the 'vast family of flowedi&#xD;
shrubs, and blooming wild flowers. Man may bf}&#xD;

mere nothing, scarcely discernible on the grand&#xD;

rior pinacle, then talk to him of power, greatness&#xD;
and glory-tell him to command and he shall be&#xD;
obeyed, and he will feel that your words are mere&#xD;
mockery." The sharp crack of a rifle broke in upon&#xD;
the young man's reveries, and casting his eyes be-&#xD;
low him, he discovered a full grown buck, making&#xD;
lis way up the hill with 4the 'utmost speed, in a'&#xD;
direct line to where he sat. Philip grasped, his&#xD;
rifle and sprang behind a tree. As the animal&#xD;
nea i'the spot where the young man stood, having&#xD;
somewhat slackened his speed, he discharged his&#xD;
rifle and the beast gave otie desperate leap into the&#xD;
air, fell backwards, and expired. The ball had&#xD;

"Vot doh till dish mean!" inquired Ruffner. "Py&#xD;

"Ah!" said Philip, smiling; "why may it 'not be a&#xD;

"But there isa no, time to lose, here, Ruffinr,"&#xD;

upon the forest; and yet oir heroes knew      not&#xD;
wherx.tog'est for the night. In a few moments,&#xD;
howeve, they caught the sight of  a,,ledge of rocks,&#xD;
at the head of a deep ravine, and proceeding to&#xD;
te~sthey discovered a spacious opening, which&#xD;
running some distance under afforded an; ample&#xD;
shelter. Having examined the cavern,if such it&#xD;
may be named, and finding no visible signs of wild&#xD;
beasts or reptiles, they determined to shelter here&#xD;
till morning; necessary preparations were accor-&#xD;
dingly made, and the.- hunters laid down,. But&#xD;
their slumbers were, frequently disturbed during&#xD;
the night by the hideous yells of piao6ling wolvgs,&#xD;
which were enjoying a rich repast on the bodies&#xD;
of the slain animals.&#xD;
Morning once more dawned upon the forest;&#xD;
and with the " early tints of opening day" our&#xD;
hunters- were astir.   Leaving the cavern, they&#xD;
proceeded in a north-easterly direction for sever-&#xD;
aL miles untithey came in sight of a considerable&#xD;
edge of rocky bluffst. This ledge of rocks is sit-&#xD;
uated on the road leading now from Washington to&#xD;
Newville, and near . the residence of Mr. John !T.&#xD;
Douglas. All things considered they form a most&#xD;
magnificent and remarkable rocky structure,&#xD;
Our hunters were soon upon these heights, en-&#xD;
joying  the hury of a cool and salubious morning&#xD;
air. To Philip the prospect was one of no little&#xD;
interest-; and although this humble locality could&#xD;
not be brought ,in comparison with the garden&#xD;
vales of Neosha, or the alluvial prairies of Kansas,'&#xD;
yet t6 his view the prospect was no 'less beautiful.&#xD;

of the forest had stood, inspired with the spirit of&#xD;
unobstructed freedom.&#xD;
"How beautiful is nture," exclaimed tl e roman-&#xD;
tic young hunter, while Ruffner sat smoking his&#xD;
pipe, u conscious of the beauties around hin-&#xD;
"How   beautiful is nature," repeated he, "the&#xD;
green  earth, the blue heavens, and the wide&#xD;
spreading forest.  Whether we gaze upon the&#xD;
mountain's summit, the spray washed shore of old&#xD;
ocean,:or the flower decked plains, all, all are beau-&#xD;
tiful and inspiring.  Cast our eyes oyer nature&#xD;
where we may and a thousand interesting objects&#xD;
meet our vision. Whether we iten to the low&#xD;
breathings of the gentle zephyrs, or the frightful&#xD;
detonations of the bellowing tempest-the glaring&#xD;
lightning's flash, or the soft and transient lightof&#xD;
the passing meteor-the iniitable radience of the&#xD;
many eglored rainbow, orthe evanescent corrusca-&#xD;
tions of the ever changing aurora-yet in all tlese&#xD;
we cannot help feeling the highest degree of holy&#xD;
veneration. Whether we gaze, spon the limpid&#xD;
waters eof the clear runnin  brooks which trickle&#xD;
over grass and pebbles alQng their flower strewn&#xD;
banks,or upon the feaif'ul precipitations of the&#xD;

sowice of infinite gratification  and he whose&#xD;

treated some distance in the rear of. the oliff, c61-&#xD;
cealing themselves in a thick'climp }f'underbrush,&#xD;
which completely hid them, from the sight ofi'the&#xD;
Indiais; bit from which the'top of the cliff became&#xD;
distinctly visible, by slightly moving to one side&#xD;
of the thick foliage.-&#xD;
It was but a few moments till our heroes discoV-'&#xD;
ered the two Indians, a man and a woman,. ascei-&#xD;
ding the rock on which they had just been seated.&#xD;
As soon as they had gained the submit, the old&#xD;
Indian, (for such they discovered him to he,) be-&#xD;
came somewhat agitated, and pointing his finge&#xD;
to his feet,, exclaimed, in a tone suffiiently loud to&#xD;
be heard by our hunters, "white man here !-"---&#xD;
Then casting his eyes around in every direction&#xD;
he seemed to scrutinize every object, gazing in the .&#xD;
direction of 'our hunters much more intensely than&#xD;
in any other. For a moment Philip imagined that&#xD;
he was discovered. After'the old man had 'satis-&#xD;
fled himself that no human eyes, apyarentlywere&#xD;
upon him, he seated himself by the side of the&#xD;
woman, and, in a low tone of voice, entered into a&#xD;
long conversation, relating some story or legend,&#xD;
connected, as our heroes supposed with the history&#xD;
of this romantic cliff. The 'young woman, (for such&#xD;
they discovered her to be,)listened very atten-&#xD;
tively and apparently, at times, seemed much af-&#xD;
fected, now and then wiping the tears from' her&#xD;
eyes.&#xD;
As the old man 'concluded his story,, he bowed&#xD;
himself upon the rock (the young woman imitating&#xD;
his movements) 'and remained ,in a kneeling pos-&#xD;
ture 'for some moments.' Presently 'a 'cloud of'&#xD;
smoke ascended from the- alter, and the orisons&#xD;
were over. Descending the rockthe two Indians&#xD;
again set forward on their journey.&#xD;
As soon as they were out of' sight and 'hearing,&#xD;
Philip and Ruffner returned to the rook. Philip's&#xD;
curiosity was excited' to know by what means the&#xD;

to Ruffner to proceed cautiously, and in no case to&#xD;
discharge his rifle unless attacked.&#xD;
Proceeding on the trail of the Indians for some&#xD;
distance without coming in sight of them, they&#xD;
halted on the banks of a small stream,* which at&#xD;
that time was very low. Here all signs of the trail&#xD;
ended, and the hunters had almost concluded that&#xD;
the old man had discovered them, and had taken&#xD;
the greater caution to leave no signs of the trail&#xD;
behind him. But Philip, who had wandered a short&#xD;
distance down the banks of the creek, observed a&#xD;
broken twig on the. opposite side.  Coming to a&#xD;
halt,}he sat down awaiting the approach of Rhffner,&#xD;
who, shortly after made his~ appearance on the op-&#xD;
posite side of the run. Philip joined him by cros-&#xD;

of the wild war of the elements-the wind driven&#xD;
rains,hail riven air, flickerig, burning and brighte-&#xD;
ing, with the astounding thunder crashes and noise&#xD;
of falling trees, mingled in horrible confusion, echo-&#xD;
ing with deep repeatings and muffled reverberations,&#xD;
from hill to hill, suggested to the romantic young&#xD;
hunter the idea that ten thousand devil drummers&#xD;
were summoning, with dismal roll, millionn of 'fire&#xD;
spirits to the world's conflagration.&#xD;
Such was a night tempest on the bans' of the&#xD;
Clearfork in 1812,* as witnessed and.;endured. by&#xD;
those two lonely pioneers.&#xD;
Philip sat gazing with emotions of' mingled awe&#xD;
and reverence upon this "elemental war."  He had&#xD;
never before been'called to witness such a mag-&#xD;
nificent -and terrific atmospheric' phenomenon, yet&#xD;
notwithstanding the danger to which he was- ex-&#xD;
posed, no   considerations would   have  induc-&#xD;
ed him to have foregone this magnificent 'exhibition&#xD;
of nature. He had often viewed nature in her mo-&#xD;
ments f calm repose, had drank dee    from  the&#xD;
fountains of the hills, and imbibed t pe seijit of the&#xD;
sequestered"forest, and now" he' had,"for the first&#xD;
time, seen nature in one ofl'her wildest poxfs3$is.&#xD;
The winds had now sunk to agetle .gale" the&#xD;
fury of the storm had passed over their 'heads, and&#xD;
the silvery stars were begining to shine out upon&#xD;
the high arch of heaven. Our hunters' arose from&#xD;
their seats in their humble shelter''which together&#xD;
with the skins of the animals, had p served themr&#xD;
against the rfury  the rai and hail,'and advancing&#xD;
towads the'margin of the bluff, gazed in'mdte as-&#xD;
tnishment into the fearful abyss below, which&#xD;
through the'darkness of'the night appeared the&#xD;
more horrible.&#xD;
"ot for noish' is dat?' exclaimed Ruffner, as his&#xD;
ears caught the sound of a continuous. roaring in a&#xD;
outherly direction from theel.,'  "'&#xD;
*  his  d is  fresh in the memories of the earlyettlers'who are stilL.&#xD;
living. in many places over which 'it passed its effects are yet visible.'&#xD;

"It is the noise of falling water," replied Philip,&#xD;
who had also caught the sound as Ruffner spoke.&#xD;
1itis a cascade in all probability,  repeated he,&#xD;
and I propose that we direct.our course thither."&#xD;
"Und, vot you mean py ter gascat?" interrogated&#xD;
the. Dutchman.&#xD;
" Why," replied Philip, "a, little cataract, over&#xD;
which the water'is precipitated."&#xD;
"Vell, veil, poot I dosh not shtan under vot you&#xD;
mean 'py ter catrack mit vauter precepty," said&#xD;
the Dutchman. "Can't you shbeak blain vot I&#xD;
knows mit out your pig vords ? "&#xD;
"Yes, yes," replied Philip, much tickled at. the&#xD;
Dutchman's language. "A cascade or' cataract is&#xD;
, a water-fall, or a place where the water rolls over&#xD;
rocks and falls to the ground."&#xD;
"Veil, den," replied Ruffner, "ve vill go und see&#xD;
dish, vot you calls him ?"&#xD;
"ascadeanswered Philip.&#xD;
.  Yaw, dish gascate.&#xD;
Accordingly the two hunters directed their steps&#xD;
in the direction ofthe qnticip4ted waterfall. They&#xD;
had descended the clif and entered,;the valley,&#xD;
leading in a southerly direction. The nearer they&#xD;
approached, the more audible ,became the sound.&#xD;
A deep and gloomy ravine lay before them, which&#xD;
they entered, following it up .for some distance,&#xD;
The.roaring of the water, echoing in the ravine&#xD;
i' the darkness of night, was quite deafening.&#xD;
Alarge quantity of rain had fallen, and this was&#xD;
now.pouringin tor ents over the   broken rocks.&#xD;
After our heroes had proceeded some distande.up&#xD;
the ravine towards the 'falls, dtheydiscovere  t&#xD;
their no small- astonislnent,:the faint glimmerings&#xD;

" lut I am anxious to learn its character, and I&#xD;
think we can succeed much better now-than if we,&#xD;
wait till morning.  As to this place being inhab-&#xD;
ited by robbers I have no fearsof that. But there&#xD;
may be a body of Indians encamping here. If so&#xD;
they will not attack us now. LpV us proceed cau-&#xD;
tiously til, we discover the nature of this light.&#xD;
The adventure may be dangerously but the ad-&#xD;
vantage is on our side, we will be under cover of&#xD;
darkness, and if we discover the company to be too&#xD;
numerous, we-. can retreat unnoticed. If they are&#xD;
Tnadins, it is evident they do not anticipate the&#xD;
approach of an enemy to night, as they have their&#xD;
fires burning."&#xD;
"Vell," replied Ruffner,u I ish ageet to any&#xD;
ting tot you ish," so saying the Dutchman reprim-&#xD;
ed his rifle, making all things secure in case of any&#xD;
emergency.&#xD;
Our heroes now approached; under cover of un-&#xD;
derbrush, theplace from which the light proceed-&#xD;
ed. The -noise of the failing water gave'then .an&#xD;
opportunity of advaning without being heard.&#xD;
The nearer they ap}p:oaohed the falls, the more.&#xD;
parent thelight appeared. After coming within&#xD;
several yards of the falls, they discovered the&#xD;
light to proceed ffrm  behind them, which' made&#xD;
the, jrecipitatig'flood appear more  rand and&#xD;
picturesque. As they halted 'hoe frder  few mo-&#xD;
ient in .oer to cisely scrutinize the place,&#xD;
Euffher discovered t1e huge ,form of an inidig ,&#xD;
standiig some ,ew feet in advance of hi~bg&#xD;

Indian glided behind a rock and was lost to'sight,&#xD;
At first Philip thought that the Indian 'had heard&#xD;
the voice of Ruffner, but then again hb knew that&#xD;
the roar of the falls would not, permit the sound of&#xD;
ten such voices to become audible from the distance&#xD;
where he stood, and as to their being discovered,&#xD;
where they were, under cover of such deep dark-&#xD;
ness, it was out of the question. Under these con-&#xD;
siderations, his fears were dismissed, and they still&#xD;
continued to advance towards the. light, until they&#xD;
came within ten steps of the'rock upon which they&#xD;
had seen the Indian. Here they paused, and a&#xD;
consultation was held, in which it *as.'agreed that&#xD;
one of them should advance upon the rock referred&#xD;
to, and with the utmost caution examine the place&#xD;
and discover if possible the position of the Indian.&#xD;
This adventure was so ie ' bold, and perilous,&#xD;
and was undertaken byh iip, while Ruffner was&#xD;
to cover his retreat in  of an attack.&#xD;
Philip gained the sockiunobserved, and unmo-&#xD;
lested, when to his no small astonishment, he dis-&#xD;
covered the objects of: hidday's pursuit. There&#xD;
behind the cascade in a,   acious cavern,* which&#xD;
. ran some distance under the. rock; sat the old In-&#xD;
dian and Wha 'Philip now supposed his daughter.&#xD;
Returning to uffner he communicated his discov-&#xD;
ery to him; when it was"'agreed upon that both&#xD;
should enter the cavern at the same time, with&#xD;
the butts of their rifles foremost, so as to create as&#xD;
little alarm as possible among the Indians. Ac-&#xD;
cordingly they proceeded   boldly, to the rock,&#xD;
when a piercing scream from the young maiden&#xD;
aroused the old man who sat smoking his pipe&#xD;
with his face turned in an opposite direction, and&#xD;
springing to his feet, confronted the two hunters&#xD;
with uplifted tomahawk.&#xD;
*This romanti ldoality has since been denominated "Mempilock Falls," and&#xD;
is often visited by the young people.  "Pio nio parties," often meet here, and&#xD;
on some Qoeaaions, political meetings are said to have been held here. These&#xD;

" I am the Indians friend," exclaimed Philip, ad,&#xD;
vancing towards the old man with extended hand.&#xD;
This was enough.      The old man     dropped his&#xD;
hatchet, grasped his hand, and bidthim a hearty&#xD;
welcome. A similar reception awaited the Dutch-&#xD;
marg.&#xD;

-descriptions of the fairy lands, where spirits and&#xD;
elves assemble to hold their nightly festivals in&#xD;
the still moonlight, which falling upon, and through&#xD;
the checkered curtain of green, gives, enchantment&#xD;
to 'the view. Such is but a faint description of this&#xD;
natural curiosity, as it appeared to Philip at the,&#xD;
period of this adventure.&#xD;
As our hunters entered this cavern a bright bla-&#xD;
zing fire, the light of which falling with an en-&#xD;
chanting softness on every object around them,&#xD;
gave the place an aspect of thg most fascinating&#xD;
and dreamy beauty. Overhanging, this arching&#xD;
entrance, and creeping out of the crevices of the&#xD;
rock. above, came down .a thick curtain of wild&#xD;
vines, interlaced and commingled with luxuriant&#xD;
honey suckles with their bright colored blossoms,&#xD;
fringing the front, of the cave on either side of&#xD;
the falls.&#xD;
But the' most beautiful sight which met theVision&#xD;
of.the young man, was the young Indian maiden.&#xD;
Her eyes: .met hisEas he :entered the cavern,&#xD;
revealing to him as he imagined, a hidden world of&#xD;
brightness and sunshine.&#xD;
"Old       said Philip, after the party had  ur-&#xD;
rounded the fire.   '1 hope we have not given you&#xD;
any offence by our intrusion here."'&#xD;
"None whatever," replied he in broken English,&#xD;

old man, , many years ago,&#xD;
inhabited the Valley of the Schuyl-&#xD;
kil, away towards the rising sun.&#xD;
It was a lovely region. The bright&#xD;
waters of this beautiful stream&#xD;
rolled between banks studded with&#xD;
the most charming flowers. Here&#xD;
our forefathers -lived for many&#xD;
years, undisturbed and unmolested,.&#xD;
until the white man came among&#xD;
them.   Then arose quarrels, and&#xD;
many.were murdered on both sides.&#xD;
At length our fathers were overpowered, and for-&#xD;
ced to leave their hunting grounds, their wigwams,&#xD;
and the graves of their fathers. They then emigra-&#xD;
ted to the Valley of the Susquehanna, and from&#xD;
thence across the Alleghenies to Ohio, settling&#xD;
down in the Valley of the Muskingum. I was but'&#xD;
a small boy at. the time.  Soon after we came to&#xD;
this region, Christian Missionaries came among us.&#xD;
They'established three stations on the Tuscarawas&#xD;
River,   The names of these stations or villages&#xD;

the way for the civilization' of our race. .While at&#xD;
this station my father and mother both died""in the&#xD;
Christian faith. Shortly afterthis sad4eveit a war&#xD;
broke out between the American white people and&#xD;
the nglish. When my parents iedI swad about&#xD;
18'years of age, 'and with' a-sister younger' than&#xD;
myself were the only members of the family living.&#xD;
Immediately after the death of our parents, my sis-&#xD;
ter' and myself, in company with 'several others,&#xD;
left Gnadenhutten for the village of Wappat~mioa,*&#xD;
on the Muskingum. Here we'lived for some tine,&#xD;

CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
CAPT, PIPE--BURNING OF CRAWFORD---LILY PIPE.&#xD;
"Now ampic mead ; and fields of waving grain,&#xD;
In golden color shine,.where-once&#xD;
The Chieftain's a'e6in stood."  [Anonymous.&#xD;
As Capt. Pipe has been introduced in a preced-&#xD;
ing chapter, it is necessary here to break the chain&#xD;
of our storrin order toagi re th leader some ad-&#xD;
ditionl 'rtieul rsd his&#xD;
Cato Fpe  w    - ", resident of Rhian4gCounty.&#xD;
He had 'ot be= #iful daughter, hoWas the on-&#xD;
ly eon:; :4    of  is cabin. 4s aeady remarked,&#xD;
he w      i }   ouh a ui  wn  ,, having distin-&#xD;
guishd       l f as such i severalufous battles.&#xD;
The Caneeup to the year 1812,&#xD;
was one mile  Ogfgi o n roeville, near the trail&#xD;
leading to 1,ansfild  A  t  time   was a Chief&#xD;
of a tribe of Defawares,"whose village stood near.&#xD;
the present village of Jeromeville in Ashland&#xD;
County.&#xD;
The personal appearance of this distinguished&#xD;
Chieftain, has already been given, as well as a&#xD;
brief history of his early life, as revealed to our&#xD;
hunters, by himself, which has never before been&#xD;
published.,&#xD;
It may not be uninteresting to state in connec-&#xD;
tion with the above that this Chieftain, in company&#xD;
with a British officer named Elliott, and an Indian&#xD;
Uhief %amed Pimpcan, visited the Tus awes Ix,&#xD;
&#xD;
r&#xD;
&#xD;
dians in the fall previous to their murder by CoL&#xD;
Williamson, and induced them to leave their ;villa-&#xD;
ges, and throw themselves under the protection of&#xD;
the British Government. Some of them     how&#xD;
ever returning in thy. early part of the follow,&#xD;
ing spring to gather in their corn, were surprised&#xD;
and cruelly butchered by that inhuman monster&#xD;
This bloody affair enraged the already highly ex-&#xD;
asperated Chieftain, and he vowed vengeance. In&#xD;
a few months afterwards an opportunity offered it-&#xD;
self.  An expedition under the command of Col.&#xD;
Crawford, wgas fitted out to destroy the Moravian&#xD;
Villages along the Sandusky.  The object, of the&#xD;
expedition was one of. extermination. No quarter&#xD;
was to be given ; but a general massacre of men,&#xD;
women and children were the'standing orders of&#xD;
the army. The expedition was unsuccessful. The&#xD;
Indians were aroused tothe highest pitch of in-&#xD;
dignation, and they flocked around their Chiefs in&#xD;
vast numbers. Capt. Pipe and another Chief named&#xD;
Wingenund were the-two leading:spirits in this&#xD;
enterprise. Col .Crawford was taken prisoner, and&#xD;
suffered a most 'horrible death at the stake. Craw-&#xD;
ford's trail to the Sandusky led through Richland&#xD;
County. Theyspot were Col. Crawford suffered;&#xD;
according to Col. John Johnson, was a fw miles&#xD;
from Upper Sandusky, .on the old 'trail leading to&#xD;
the fig :Spriag, Wyandot-Town.   It was on the&#xD;
right bank of the" trail, going west, on a bottom  on&#xD;
the east bank of the Tymoctee Creek. The noto-&#xD;
riotis.Simon Girty was present during .the burning&#xD;
of Col. Crawford, and witnessed hishorrible suffers-&#xD;
ings with a savage delight. It is statedhowever,&#xD;
that Girty offered to purchase the prisoner from&#xD;
the Idians for three hundred and fifty dollars.-&#xD;
But Pipe considered th proposition a high insult,&#xD;
and replied, with a scowl of indignation on his&#xD;
countenance, "Sir, do you think I ain a squaw?&#xD;
if you say on word more og~ this subject, I will&#xD;

of  noble birth. and   commanding talents rhad&#xD;
paid her a visit, on purpose to solicit her hand;&#xD;

"may she not possess some Indian blood at least."&#xD;
"Nay, nay, " replied Philip, somewhat confused,,&#xD;
"I cannot bring my mind to believe that there is&#xD;
one drop in her veins.. There is something within&#xD;
my bosom which prompts me to say she is- purely&#xD;
Anglo Saxon. .She is so'unlike all that constitutes&#xD;
a savage nature, that it , is impossible for her to&#xD;
be of Indian origin.  One glance at her love&#xD;
speaking eyes, would be sufficient to convince you&#xD;
that the girl is no';8avage, at least."&#xD;
"Well," replied Kate, "you have aroused within&#xD;
me a spirit ofcuriosity, 'and 'a strong desire to see&#xD;
this mysterious being."&#xD;

bandage of sparkling gems of contrasted colors,&#xD;
surrounded her head, while her jet black hair fell&#xD;
in glossy ringlets around her shoulders. Another,&#xD;
set with brilliants, surrounded her neck. Her feet&#xD;
were encased in richly colored moccasins, iigh-&#xD;

of beads. Pendant from her ears were two mas-&#xD;

told:him  coneernin  the murder. But all to ano&#xD;
purpose. The old geitleinans persisted, in staying&#xD;
in his cabin-&#xD;
Ox this occasion Johnny Appleseed distinguished&#xD;
himself-as a."swift messenger," travelling day and&#xD;
night, bare-headed and bare-footed, warning the&#xD;
inhabitants of the approaching danger. He visited&#xD;
every cabin within his route, from the Black Fork&#xD;
to Mts Vernon, exclaiming, "the Spirit of the Lord&#xD;
is upon me, and. he hath . anointed me to blow&#xD;
the trumpet in the ,wilderness, and sound an alarm&#xD;
in the forest, for behold the tribes of the heathen&#xD;
are round about your doors, and a devouring flame&#xD;
foiloweth after them.))&#xD;
It- was ascertained however in a few days after-&#xD;
wards, that the alaarwas unfounded, and that the&#xD;
British and the Indians had enough of work to do&#xD;
in i$heregion of the Lakes, for this surrender was&#xD;
immediately followed kby'a series of splendid naval&#xD;
vietorie.&#xD;
Bi th    hearing news that followed the siarm&#xD;
did    ' =relax the energy of the settlers in con-&#xD;
structing hbuses-f safety. 1hey occupied a dan-&#xD;

Immediately after the surrender of Hull,' the&#xD;
Jeromeville Indians, left the country forCtleveland,&#xD;
where they threw themselves under the protection&#xD;
of the United States Governinent.&#xD;
Wewould here reraarkthat at this period there&#xD;

tly the Dutchman called to mind the Chieftain's&#xD;
warning, andtaking his rifle in hand, set out im-&#xD;

I do not think it prudent to remain Here all night.&#xD;
Daylight will discover our hiding place to them,&#xD;
and we shall be made prisoners, and probably meet&#xD;
a cruel fate."&#xD;
" I think not," replied Philip; "these fellows do&#xD;
not suspicion our being here, and by retiring some&#xD;
distance in the thicket, we can elude their obsenr&#xD;
ovation, as they will leave the cabin at the first&#xD;
dawn of the day."&#xD;
To this proposition Alfred readily conser ted;&#xD;
and our heroes retired some distance into the thic -&#xD;
et where they remained till morning.&#xD;
Daylight was just opening in 'the'east, when our&#xD;
heroes were awakened by the noise and bustle of&#xD;
the Indians in the cabin, preparing' to start 'on&#xD;
their work of destruction.&#xD;
"What infernal throats;" "exclaimed Alfred,' 'as&#xD;
a horrible yell broke in upon the -,morning air, as.&#xD;
the savages left the cabin to pursue their journey&#xD;
through the(.wilderness.&#xD;
Philip and his companion remained ir" their&#xD;
hiding place until they were certain the savages&#xD;
were out of hearing, when they retraced their steps&#xD;
to th-'cabin, which they once more.entered.&#xD;
"See here," said Alfred. as he 'picked p f&#xD;

"Let them   come !" .cried Philip, "they shall'&#xD;

Onward came the two stalwart savages, little&#xD;
dreaming that they were rushing into the jawa of&#xD;
death. Nearer and still :nearer came the unsus-&#xD;
pecting Indian.. OCrak.! crack!. went two rifles&#xD;
at ,the sameinstant; and the two savages fell to&#xD;

the, spot where the fallen savages lay, but not un-&#xD;

was jst breathing his last, while the other made&#xD;
several unsuccessful attempts to gain his feet..,&#xD;

Our heroes were now. doubly armed, as they&#xD;
seized the rifles of the fallen Indians, and tarried&#xD;
them along. C ontinuing their journey they came&#xD;
to a singular spring of transparent water whieh&#xD;
formed a most'interesting natural pheIomenon. It&#xD;
was now mid day, and the sun was pouring its flood&#xD;
of light upon the surface of the water, which being&#xD;

were s-en rolling turbulently across the heavens,&#xD;
the murkystorm clouds. Weary' and fatigued he&#xD;
lay dowhn to rest, after seeking a shelter from the&#xD;

interest to the old man's legend, -and after pausing&#xD;
a moment, Philip replied&#xD;
"Venerable sir," your' tradition contains some&#xD;
features, peculiar applicable to the condition of&#xD;
my mind -at this time. Like that young warrior, I&#xD;
shall start in search of your missing daughter, and&#xD;
should I fail in finding her in some earthly wigwam,&#xD;
I hope to- 'find her nestled among the unfading&#xD;
beauties of the spirit land."&#xD;
"May the blessings of the 'Great Spirit rest, up-&#xD;
on your adventure," said the Captain, with much&#xD;
feeling.&#xD;
"And now .young men continuedhe, I conjure&#xD;

settlers of all the property they came across, and then returned to Detroi in&#xD;
their canoes. There' were, however, three of this party who remained with, the&#xD;
intention of plundering the few scattered families in the wilderness. One of&#xD;
these was a young Delaware Chief, named Sac-a~manc. This was !the same&#xD;
notorious Chief whose name was a terror to many a pooh pioneer family. Like&#xD;
a stealthy tiger, he sought his prey in smbuscade. The dame ofSac-a-mane&#xD;

But since the murder of the Seymour family noth-&#xD;

from' the Black Fork was a matterpf cojecLge&#xD;

it dreary and desolate... He had made.gqiry&#xD;

Philip was no little astonished in  eetinzg him&#xD;

After the Indians had committed the murder&#xD;
they determined to dispatch Billy also. With this&#xD;
intention they proceeded immediately to the cabin&#xD;
of Ruffner, hoping to find him there, but had not&#xD;
proceeded more than a mile when they met him&#xD;
in the woods with his rifle, on his way ,to the Sey-&#xD;
mour cabin., The Indians had recognized him first,&#xD;
and secreting themselves'waited the boy's approach.&#xD;
Coming up td them they sprang out of their&#xD;
hiding place and ordered him to halt. The sudden&#xD;
appearance of the savages alarmed him, and hasti-&#xD;
ly raising his rifle -to a level, fired upon thre one&#xD;
nearest him, but the ball" whistled harmlessly by&#xD;
the savage, who rushing upon him was about to&#xD;
smite him to' the ' earth. with. his tomahawk, when&#xD;
the strongg arm of another savage behind 'him,&#xD;
eauights  rm and held it fast at the same 'time&#xD;

found themselves on the banks of 'the Clear Fork.&#xD;
Thay had halted, xear where the thriving little&#xD;

thence they proceeded to the banks of the Vernon&#xD;
river, or, as it is often called, "Owl Creek." 'Here&#xD;
Billy was transferred into the hands ofan old Chief&#xD;
who with some' of his tribe, were on their way' to&#xD;
the seat of war on the 1Maumee. The next morn-&#xD;
ing after their arrival on the waters of Owl Creek,&#xD;
Billy arid his new master took up their line of iharch.&#xD;
The old Chief was much pleased with'the boy,&#xD;
and gave special instructions to treat him kindly.&#xD;
Billy recognized his kindness and sought ever&#xD;
opportunity to gratify his new master.&#xD;
Towards evening they came to the bank of the&#xD;
Olentangy or Whetstone River, where they struck&#xD;
their tents, and encamped for tt  g  N-ext&#xD;
morning they again took up their  a eand con-&#xD;
tinued their journey until they arrived at the banks&#xD;
of the Sandusky, now in CrawfordC ounty    and&#xD;

made himself their superiors, which, on. several on-&#xD;
casions, he fered would prove dangerous to 'his&#xD;

to, become master of the sport.' Risheroism was&#xD;
always approved by his master, who would often&#xD;
pat him on the head, anad call him in broker}Eng-&#xD;
lish: "Fine boy-brate boy-good boy &amp;amp;c."&#xD;
Bily remained ;in tis region for several days,&#xD;
during which time he affected entire contentment.&#xD;
Oneday the Indians held 'a council, in which it was'&#xD;
proposed to form avscouting party, for thepurpose&#xD;
of pInler. Accordingly the time was appointed&#xD;
o which to..set out on their .,expedition. Billy,&#xD;
though contrary to-his solicitations, was left be-&#xD;
hind with the women and children and old mien.-&#xD;
It was on this occasion that he meditated his es-&#xD;
cape. The Indians 'left the village early one&#xD;
morning, and Billy ,the night following. The&#xD;
Scouting;party 'left for the Huron river, and Billy&#xD;
for Fortindlyof which he had heard the direc-&#xD;
tion, and had' been 'assured that it stood upon&#xD;
Blanchard's'fork of the Auglaize.,&#xD;
.e evening Billy started upon his lonely and&#xD;
perilfrsjourney, was dark and rainy. The wilder"f&#xD;
ness was shrouded in gloom. Wild beasts and wild&#xD;
men surro'und4ed him; but thesewere no barrier in&#xD;
hitwayd He had been raised injthe 'woods, aiidt&#xD;
the yells and" owls of savages and wild' bets-&#xD;
His trusty rifle was upon his shoulder, his salping&#xD;
kife hung ahis side and.in 'his 'bosom he barredd&#xD;
a heart ii gnagious- -above fear and eowadi+e-&#xD;

During this night he was attacked by a gang 'of&#xD;
&#xD;
"OWNSRJAPss ltr6&#xD;
wolves, but, he managed to keep them at bay. In&#xD;
the' bourse of an hour or two after Ihe had' started&#xD;
fromhis shelter his  eyes caught the, glimpse oft a&#xD;
light some distance ahead of him in the Woods.&#xD;
Moving cautiously towards it he discovered'it to&#xD;
be the caip fire of a small band of Indians" Ex&#xD;
amining the camp carefully he preceived that; the&#xD;
party consisted of three savages, either of Whom&#xD;
'he could have laid dead in his seat,'-bat fighting&#xD;
them Was out of the~ question." Watching them&#xD;
for some moments he discovered' that they were&#xD;
in great glee, 'making merry over their super,&#xD;
after which they lay down to rest. Billy kept&#xD;
quiet for some time after the savages elay 'down,&#xD;
until he imagined they where asleep; when he&#xD;
again commenced his journey. After traveling&#xD;
as far up the river as he deemed necessary, he cros-&#xD;
sed the, stream and proceeded westward hoping&#xD;
to strike the banks of Blanchard's Fork, and then&#xD;
the Fort. Continuing his course till morning, he&#xD;
again sought shelter, and 'laid by till evening, when&#xD;
he again continued his course, as he supposed to-&#xD;
wards the Fort. But Billy had missed his course&#xD;
and instead of making Fort Fiddly, his place of des-&#xD;
tination, he arrived at the gorge or ravine *here&#xD;
he met 'his friend Philip Seymour.&#xD;
Billy's adventure since leaving "the Sandusky&#xD;
was attended with no danger other than that aris-&#xD;
ing from the attack of wolves. But with these he&#xD;
was familiar, and knew well their disposition and&#xD;
Smode of attack.  The report of- the- ifle which&#xD;
Philip 'aid 'his companion had heard, wad produced&#xD;
by Billy, who had dischaiged it at on' of these&#xD;
creatures.  The' animal had followed him, but&#xD;
Billy delayed his progress by giving hith the coin-&#xD;
teite of his rifle.&#xD;

retired to 4fhe shelter under the bank, who&#xD;
entered into a conversation, in which each party&#xD;
revealedto the other his adventures.:&#xD;
Billy, said Philp after the former had given&#xD;
Vhe latter a history of: his adventure, "I am  very&#xD;
glad to see you once more. I have oftenwon-&#xD;
dered what. had become of you since the murder, of&#xD;
our friends= on the Black Fork. Ihad come to the&#xD;
conaluion that the red devils had taken your scalp&#xD;
too."'&#xD;
"Thee here, Mr. Themour, thee here," said Bil-&#xD;
ly holding out his rifle, "do you think thir, that&#xD;
this shooting iron will 'perit any of theth  cur-.&#xD;

 "tOth:their piAthurth," responded Billy, " they&#xD;
can't thcalp me 'fore I give them one dothe of&#xD;

"Some backbone in this fellow Alf," said Philip,&#xD;
addressing himself to his companion: "Billy's the&#xD;
real g4tand no mistake."&#xD;
"There's none," replied Alfred, "that I have&#xD;
seen. in.my travels, in whom cprbine such heroism&#xD;
and sagacity, considering his age. I am  truly.&#xD;
proud ,f his courage; and shall hope to have ,hhim&#xD;

"That is just what will please him," said Philip.&#xD;
"Whaty sayouBilly."&#xD;

"But, BiUy, you must be subject to our admnou&#xD;

us incautiously."&#xD;
"I understand yer, thir," said Billy, "but muth&#xD;
thay yer admonithion ith of no uth in cath of an&#xD;
attack from ihnakth."&#xD;
At the mention of the word snakes, Philip's grav-&#xD;
ity was disturbed-he was, forced to give vent to&#xD;
a fit of laughter, as his mind wandered back to the&#xD;
battle of snakes on Clea Fork, and at the recol-&#xD;
lections of his horrible dream on that eventful&#xD;
night, he once more muttered a bitter curse on&#xD;
the snake family, after which he related to Alfred&#xD;
all the particulars concerning that adventure.&#xD;
Alfred was much amused. on hearing Phiiip's ac-&#xD;
count of this affair, and Billy would, every now&#xD;
and then, as an opportunity presented itself, look&#xD;
at Philip with one of his rougish smiles, and, ex-&#xD;
claim: "Cuth the tuna/lct."&#xD;
Several hours had thus passed away and the lit-&#xD;
tle party had enjoyed themselves with the most&#xD;
heartfelt happiness. Weary with conversation&#xD;
they lay down to rest with their rifles under their&#xD;
heads. Their sl ahnber was unbroken, and they did&#xD;
not awake till morning twilight was visible.&#xD;
As soon as our heroes had partaken of some re-&#xD;
freshments, they left their shelter and once more&#xD;
plunged into the forest and continued their course&#xD;
in a'southernly direction until they came in sight&#xD;
of an Indian village,* on the banks of a beautiful&#xD;
streamt of water.  Near the village was a&#xD;
orchard of fruit trees! of about ten or fifteen years&#xD;
standing. These trees were  laden  with   fruit.&#xD;
Upon inspection they found the principle inhabi-&#xD;
tants to be old men, women and children.&#xD;
&#xD;
*This village was called Wap-agh-ko-notta and was' the residence of the&#xD;
Shawnees afte- they were driven from. Piqua, by Gen. Clark.&#xD;
tiog river, so called by the Indians, from the circumstance of Mr. MeKee;&#xD;

"Whst next," said Alfred, as they care, to a halt&#xD;
a few hundred yards from the Villa ge,: "shall we'&#xD;
enter this village and rely uppn the mercy of the&#xD;
savages, or shall we retreat before we are discov-&#xD;
ered."&#xD;
"Thee; here Misther AIf," interrupted Billy,&#xD;
"Thee here, ther'th no going back with thith thild,&#xD;

"Come, come Billy," said Philip, you mus'nt be'&#xD;
go venturesome you'l get us into a bad fix by being.&#xD;
too heroic. It won't do, you must be obedient or&#xD;
we'll never live to see Tilly's face again. You'&#xD;
know, Billy if you were to get into a snap, I am.&#xD;
bound to help you out, therefore, you must  not&#xD;
put our lives in danger by being so desperately&#xD;
reckless."&#xD;
"Hist," said Alfred, '"I hear the sound of foot-&#xD;
steps among the brush, I'm  afraid we're caught&#xD;
this time."&#xD;
The young hunters, each sheltered himself be-&#xD;
hind a tree and' held' himself in readiness foi&#xD;
defence, but scarcely had they found shelter when&#xD;
the voice of a lone eanine sentinel,broke the stillness&#xD;
of'the night, with a good English accentuation of&#xD;
Bow, wow, wow,."&#xD;
"Thod blatht the dog," said Billy, and raising&#xD;
his rife to his shoulder, was about to give the an-&#xD;
ima a quietus, but Philip prevented him.&#xD;
"Get ouV-go home you infernal whelp," said&#xD;
Philip, 'as the animal' continued his howling. But&#xD;
the dog had never been trained in Noah Webster's&#xD;
school'of language, aid as the'Dutchman would' say&#xD;
he could "nix fort1ag," and therefore he howled&#xD;
'With more vehemence.&#xD;
"What the deuce shall we do," asked Alfred, if&#xD;
we retreat the dog will pursue us, 'and bring out&#xD;
allthe warriors of the village on our track, and if&#xD;
wd 'stay here we shall be. surrounded and taken&#xD;
&#xD;
1&#xD;
&#xD;
" Well our dilemma is none of the pleasantest,&#xD;
and I am lost to know how to decide," said Philip.&#xD;
" But it is my opinion-"&#xD;
At this moment a combination of yells greeted&#xD;
their ears. The savages had heard the barking,&#xD;
which they knew to be an indication of danger.&#xD;
Instantly, they hastened to the, place, where they&#xD;
found our heroes. Upon discovery, Philip stepped&#xD;
from behind a tree, and advancing toward an old&#xD;
Chief, proffered him his han1, which the old man&#xD;
readily accepted. Alfred and Billy came next,&#xD;
each in 'turn shaking hands with the old man and&#xD;
his warriors. The old Chief invited them to the&#xD;
village, where they spent the evening and the&#xD;
next day in the most agreeable manner. Some of&#xD;
the inhabitants could speak the English language&#xD;
quite fluently.&#xD;
It was during their stay in this village that Phil-&#xD;
ip formed the acquaintance of several friendly&#xD;
Chiefs, one of whom will form the' subject of an&#xD;
interesting chapter in this narrative.&#xD;
After spending a day or two with these friendly&#xD;
Indians, our young heroes again commenced their&#xD;
adventure, shaping their course in the direct4pi&#xD;
of the Muskingui. They had learned from  the&#xD;
old .Chief that a-party of Indians had passed near&#xD;
their village in that direction, and Philip and Al-&#xD;
fred determined'to follow them, We shall leave&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF BLACK HOOF THE DISTINGUISFHED&#xD;
SHA-WA-NOES CHIEF.&#xD;
"And thus while seated on his couch of green,&#xD;
T1'he, old man talked of manya scene&#xD;
Of days gone by. Of many a legend old,&#xD;
And magic tale."&#xD;
Black Hoof, the old Indian Chief mentioned in&#xD;
the last chapter, belonged to the Sha-wan-oes tribe.&#xD;
He was a warrior of high rank and notoriety; and&#xD;
was born in Florida, a few years after which, with&#xD;
a portion of the tribe he removed' to Ohio and&#xD;
Pennsylvania.   Black Hoof, with others of his&#xD;
tribe, .were present at Braddock's defeat, near&#xD;
Pittsburgh, in 1755. He was engaged in all the&#xD;
wars from that time until the treaty of Greenville&#xD;
in 1795. He was noted for his cunning, sagacity&#xD;
and experience; and united with these, was his&#xD;
fierce and desperate bravery. He was bold and&#xD;
daring almost to recklessness. Being the invete-&#xD;
rate' foe' to the white man, his vengence knew&#xD;
scarcely any limits; and' under his tomahawk and&#xD;
scalping knife, many a white man had met his eter-&#xD;
nal fate. Black Hoof maintained that no peace&#xD;
should be made, nor any negotiations entered into&#xD;
with the whites, except on condition ;that the lat-&#xD;
.ter should repass the mountains, and leave the M-&#xD;
sissippi valley to the sole occupancy of the'fnaf'&#xD;
tribes. These were his sentimnts, and he ewer&#xD;
&#xD;
,&#xD;
&#xD;
all the energies of his mind and body in carrying&#xD;
then out.&#xD;
Black Hoof was the orator of his tribe, and was&#xD;
well versed in the traditions of his people. But&#xD;
although he was a stern and uncompromising en-&#xD;
emy of the whites, and although, 'through a long&#xD;
series of forty years he had nerved his arm in a&#xD;
hundred bloody battles, yet he became at length&#xD;
convinced,,that the struggles of his race against&#xD;
the encroachment of the whites were in vain. A&#xD;
deep conviction of this truth rested upon his mind&#xD;
and he communicated his apprehensions to his tribe.&#xD;
The campaign of General Wayne completely over-&#xD;
threw all hopes of their success, and he abandon-&#xD;
ed the project forever. He signed the treaty of&#xD;
peace at Greenville,and continued a faithful friend&#xD;
to the whites ever afterward. He died at the ad-&#xD;
vanced age of 110 years, a short .time previous&#xD;
to the treaty of 1831.*&#xD;
In the war of 1812, Tecumseh     and his brother,&#xD;
the prophet, paid him a visit for the purpose of&#xD;
enlisting him in their cause,but he per-emptorily&#xD;
refused them; and although he did not personally&#xD;
take an active part in the war, yet he exerted a&#xD;
salutary, influence in favor of the Americans.&#xD;
Such was Black Hoof, the distinguished Sha-wa-&#xD;
noes Chief. Philip and his companions were high-&#xD;
ly entertained and pleased with him; and although&#xD;
an untutored:savage, they found,;him nevertheless&#xD;
to be a most graceful and pleasing manet&#xD;
They had conversed with him, vith freeness and&#xD;
interest, and' he had revealed to them' a most thril-&#xD;
ling account of his adventures for forty years past.&#xD;
*This treaty was made with the senceas of Lewiston,-ald the,Sha-wa-noes&#xD;
ofWai-ko etotsby' James Gaianer;ad Col. n'Ilvaia.  inriisioners&#xD;
appoin ted by the, Government. The terms offered to these Indians wer'e lib-&#xD;
eral, and theyconsentedto be removed beyond the Mississippi. aThen were&#xD;
removed to te Indian Territory on Kansas river in 133. 'Por Black Hoof,&#xD;
his remains are on our soil, while his tribA roam over the lands of the far West.&#xD;
tOol. Johnson describes this man as the most gracefuluIndian he had *vet&#xD;
"nian.as.,ossessing the most natural and happy faculty of communicating&#xD;

18ZONBR LXIYE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Black Hoof was the particular friend of Captain&#xD;
Pipe, they had fought side by side against the&#xD;
whites up to the treaty of 1795. He had learned&#xD;
of the burningof Greentown, and the masacre of&#xD;
the whites on the Black Fork, and expressed a deep&#xD;
abhorance against the whole proceeding, but laid&#xD;
the blame of the whole affair upon Col. Greer and&#xD;
Kratzes.- He had been informed of hi. friend's&#xD;
(Capt. Pipe) removal to Cleveland, but knew noth-&#xD;
ing of the circumstance of his daughter's myste-&#xD;
rious disappearance.&#xD;
On being told of this affair, he seemed somewhat&#xD;
perplexed, and deeply affected. He applauded&#xD;
the galantr-y of Philip and his companions, and.&#xD;
promised them the protection of his tribe while in&#xD;
his dominions.&#xD;
Before dismissing the history of Black Hoof, we&#xD;
must notice one or two other traits in his character&#xD;
which in Indian life seem quite remarkable., It is&#xD;
well known that Indians practice Poligamy; and&#xD;
are generally in favor of sacrificing the lives of&#xD;
prisoners at the stake. These two enormities&#xD;
Black Hoof condemned. He hved 40 years with.&#xD;
one wife, and never put to death a single prisoner&#xD;
by fire. ie was not- present at the burning of&#xD;
Crawford, or perhaps that unfortunate man might&#xD;
have been spared the pains of such a horrible&#xD;
death.&#xD;
With these' considerations concerning the life&#xD;
and character of this remarkable man, we -are pre-&#xD;
paz'ed to fully appreciate hissterling integrity.&#xD;
Philip, and his companions left the old Chief&#xD;
much entertained, delighted;and refreshed, with&#xD;
the understanding that'they would return to the&#xD;
village on their way back from the Muskingum.&#xD;

Philip and his companions, after leaving the&#xD;
village of Wap-a-konet-ta, shaped their course to-&#xD;
wards the head waters of the Sciota, and proceed-&#xD;
ing down, its banks came to a white settlement, in&#xD;
which they found a commodious. Block House,*&#xD;
where they were hospitably entertained. They&#xD;
communicated to the settlers the object of their&#xD;
adventure in this region, and made enquiry as to&#xD;
the condition of the country through which they&#xD;
had to pass on' their way to Zanesville,&#xD;
It was a cold and wintry morning when our he-&#xD;
roes left the Block- House, and once .more plunged&#xD;
into the wild woods. Winter:was now set.in-&#xD;
dark clouds and dark days.--deep snows, chilling&#xD;
winds and biting frosts were now to be encounter-&#xD;
ed.. The prospectbefore them was, to use a mod-&#xD;
ern' phrase, "a little mixed."  But the bold  .,d&#xD;
fearless hearts of Philip 'and his-companions, cow-&#xD;
ered not before the approach of cold or danger.&#xD;
Their object Was one of humanity, andupon the&#xD;
success of their adventure depended thehappness&#xD;

of the fearless and generous hearted leader of that&#xD;
little band. They were enured to hardships, pri-&#xD;
vations and dangers. Each one was homeless and&#xD;
friendless, and dependent upon his own exertions&#xD;
for support and protection. Reader, place your-&#xD;
self, by imagination, in their condition--in the&#xD;
heart of a drery wilderness, exposed to the in-&#xD;
clemency of the weather-rain sleet, snow and&#xD;
cold; while wild beasts and savage foes roamed&#xD;
the woods in all directions.&#xD;
"Billy," said Philip, "['m afraid that camping out&#xD;
these cold nights will be. hurtful to your health.,&#xD;
I am almost sorry I did not prevail upon you to&#xD;
remain in the block house till spring."&#xD;
"Thirtainly Mr. Themour, you'rmithtaken in yer&#xD;

"True, true, Billy, I didnt think of that. "Bear's&#xD;

The apparent earnestness with which Billy ask-&#xD;
ed the question, completed with the comic ex-&#xD;
pression of his countenance, constrained Philip and"&#xD;
his' companion to indulge in a hearty laugh.&#xD;
Aware that Philip and Alfred were indulging a laugh&#xD;
at his expense, Billy 'collected his wits and cooly&#xD;
replied:.&#xD;
"Yeth, yeth, now I underthand yer--thod blatht&#xD;

tha i&#xD;
"ly'rpied hilip, "I am proud of our cour-&#xD;
ag  bnn  raveryg, but I must protest against their&#xD;
ehtioi on this occasion.      think it rather&#xD;
donbtful case to igterruyt these red devils before&#xD;
night. Were infor a contest with them cer-&#xD;
taii, but our attack must he under cover of dark-&#xD;
ness.".&#xD;
Ourleroes thus lay secreted for some time con-&#xD;
versing infr=low tone of voice, during which the&#xD;
savages seemed to enjoy themselves inthe highest&#xD;
degree. After finishing their meal they proceeded&#xD;
ontheir journey, followed by our heroes until they&#xD;
came to a romantic gorge, known to the early hun-&#xD;
ters by rt  nameiof the "Black  ind Marrows.,&#xD;
e te Idias made. their camp for the night.&#xD;
Thesun had gone down behind a heavy bank of&#xD;
dar  ouds, as our hunters arrived at these "Nar-&#xD;
s  They.had traced the Indians into the de-&#xD;
nt ering to enter until they had reconnoi-&#xD;
tered, they did not pursue them.&#xD;
,The Na rows were dark and gloomy, and the&#xD;
wilderness around them cheerless and forbidding.&#xD;
,,e yougmen were in the midst of dangers, but&#xD;
these dangers had no terrors to disarm  them of&#xD;
their courage.&#xD;
"Alfred," said chili  "you and Billy remain&#xD;
here, whle 'make a small circuit to the top of the&#xD;
liffs. The reddevils are in this gorge, and will&#xD;
knimke their camp in the most secure position. In&#xD;
c.~sd4am attackedyou can cometomy distance.&#xD;
nt u tildiscovered you must remain quiet."&#xD;
I hi  then proceeded ioiselessly and aitious-&#xD;
 to le:p of the cliff, and haltingon lthe very&#xD;
&#xD;
verge, discovered a light beneath him, but- could&#xD;
discover no signs of the savages themselves.&#xD;
It was evident to Philip that the, camp fire vas&#xD;
under his feet, and. reflected the, light on the op-&#xD;
posite side. The side of the narrows on which&#xD;
he stood seemed considerably more elevated than&#xD;
the opposite side. Returning to his companions&#xD;
he bade them follow him to the opposite bank,&#xD;
where they discovered the three savages seated&#xD;
under the shelving of the rocks immediately under&#xD;
the cliff where Philiphadstood. A bright fire lighted&#xD;
up the gloomy gorge, and the unsuspecting sava-&#xD;
ges were making merry over their evening meal,&#xD;
little dreaming that the eyes of their white foes&#xD;
were upon them. Their camp was, as Philip .had&#xD;
expected, in the most inaccessible part of ,the&#xD;
gorge. They could not approach them at either&#xD;
end of the narrows without detection, but from&#xD;
their position on there lower, bank of the narrows,&#xD;
they had an uninterrupted view of the savages.&#xD;
"Now's our chance," said Philip. "Billy, single&#xD;
out your man, and make your aim sure."&#xD;
"Well, third " whisper'ed Billy, "I will thettle&#xD;
my account with that devilish ugly looking thavage.&#xD;
He juth lookth like the thame thap who took me&#xD;
prithoner on the Black Fork, and I want to thoot&#xD;
him becauth he juth lookth like him."&#xD;
"A very good reason Billy,"-said Philip, 4he&#xD;
shall be your man." Then turning to Alfred- he&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"Alf, you single out of that fellow on the left,&#xD;
and I will take' the other. One, two, three' said&#xD;
Philip in a whisper and' the report of three rifles&#xD;
rang out upon the night air of that deep and&#xD;
gloomy gorge, bringing almost instantaneous death&#xD;
to three unsuspecting savages within.' But in a&#xD;
few minutes after the sound of their rifles had died&#xD;
away in the distant forest, the sound of advancing&#xD;
footsteps were hear d sonme distaticedin heirherar.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVIII.&#xD;
&#xD;
A BRIEF KSKETCO OF THE MURDERED INDIANS-HEROIC&#xD;
ALEXANDER( M CONNEL.&#xD;
&#xD;
ACT OF&#xD;
&#xD;
The party of Indians mentioned in our last chap-&#xD;
ter, had been taken prisoners near New Philadl-&#xD;
phia in Tuscarawas' County; and conveyed to Sen-&#xD;
eca through 'Zanesville, which was, at this time, a&#xD;
thrivingblittle village. 'Here the Indians ,were&#xD;
lodged in prison over night; during 'Which time&#xD;
some of the settlers paid them a visit. The In-&#xD;
diansould, to some extent, understand and speak&#xD;
he glish language.&#xD;
At first when they were taken, they appeared&#xD;
alen andrefused 10 enter into conversation; but&#xD;
raduallythey became more cheerful and communi-&#xD;
cative.  diIg assures that they would be treated&#xD;
kindly, and that no one should harm them, they&#xD;
gave a fall statement of their lives.&#xD;
It appeas' from this statement that they belong-&#xD;
ed to'he Delaware tribe, and that one of them&#xD;
was oneof the five that attacked 'the Seymour cab-&#xD;
in 'This one called himself John Buckskin,&#xD;
and stated that after the whites had burned their&#xD;
villageon the Black Fork, he vowed vengence on&#xD;
every white man who came into his power; that&#xD;
hbhad formedthe plot to murder the Seymour&#xD;
familynd plunder them of their money;; that he&#xD;
was also in thwbattle at the Copus cabin, where he&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
Was WQ nded in jthe arm with a bullet.,:e also&#xD;
stated'that his own arm had slain the ', ack Fork&#xD;
Dutchman,' (meaning.Ruffner,)whiom. he, rep reseu tr&#xD;
ed as, one of the most powerful men he had eyer&#xD;
con tended with. This with .some other facts, cozw&#xD;
netted with the depredations on the Black Fork&#xD;
settlement, already known to the. reader, weie&#xD;
made known to the settlers of Zanesville, by this&#xD;
Indian.&#xD;
On being asked whether he did not think, he&#xD;
did wrong in murdering   the  innocent, people&#xD;
the'ife, he .replied in the negative. He further sta-&#xD;
ted that under similar circumstances he, would do&#xD;
so again,' He -then askedd for some tobacco:whichz&#xD;
being given him, he divided it with his'companions,&#xD;
and lighting their pipes they sat down, and engag-&#xD;
ed in smoking and conversing in his own language.&#xD;
The next morning after their imprisonniet in&#xD;
Zanesville, a crowd of spectators gathered around&#xD;
the window on the outside. One.of these asked&#xD;
them if they, could :sing. They replied'in theaf-&#xD;
firmative, pnd being requested, to do so, one of the&#xD;
Indians commenced an Indian songto which he&#xD;
put a chrisian- air. On being asked where he&#xD;
learned that tune, he replied from Jesus Christ at&#xD;
Gnadenhutten. He was asked to sing again, but' he red&#xD;
fused,stating that white people did not like Indians.&#xD;
" Yes," replied one of the bystanders" we do&#xD;
" You lie,'"replied the Indian.&#xD;
"No I don't," said, st,4 pectator.&#xD;
"Well, then," said 'the Indian "if you like mie&#xD;
give me one-fappennyhit."  r"&#xD;
The spectator refused   ,&#xD;
'" I knew you lied," responded ItheIndian,&#xD;

The village was situated in a beautiful location&#xD;
and the country around was truly delightful. They&#xD;
were soon upon the lawn, and separated into tw~o&#xD;
parties, one consisting of the women, and the men.&#xD;
Our heroes were requested to perticipate in the&#xD;
sport, but they politely declined, with the exceP'&#xD;
tion. of Billy, who was anxious to engage in the&#xD;
game, which was to be a game of 'foot ball."&#xD;
The Indian boys were much rejoiced in, having&#xD;
Billy for their companion in the game, and. Billy&#xD;
was determined on distinguishing himself as a mas-&#xD;
ter 1andat the:sport.&#xD;
At thismga e the men were to play against the-&#xD;
women,and the'rules by which they were to be&#xD;
governed;were as follows: The men were not to&#xD;
touch the bal withstheirshands, on pen alty of loos-&#xD;
ing the game; but the women were allowed to pick&#xD;
it up, run withit, and throw it as far as they could;&#xD;
but in so doing the men were permitted to catch&#xD;
the-women shakethem, and, even throw them&#xD;
downh order'to extricate the ball 'from them;&#xD;
but  tI to touch it only with their feet.&#xD;
At t     oost et remityof'the play ground,&#xD;
Staes were driven in the earth, and when the ball&#xD;

game wa   oed     hen all were ready the Chief&#xD;

lasted for more than an hour, which swed that&#xD;
the parties were well matched. At one period of&#xD;
the game, the ball was caught bya young .Indian&#xD;
squaw; Billy was close behind her side; she at-&#xD;
tempted to run, he followed and immediately she&#xD;
was in his arms. A scuffle ensuedwhich lasted for&#xD;
a few moments. The young squaw. vas hiseqital&#xD;
in strength, and Billy found his-match. At length&#xD;
she succeeded in prostrating her antagonist. T1ie&#xD;
women sent up a shout of triumph. Quick as&#xD;
lightning Billy was again up 9n his feet, and, bing&#xD;
.chagrined at -hearing his female antagonistso&#xD;
highly applauded, and knowing that Philp aud&#xD;
Alfred would.never cease tormentinghirm over his&#xD;
defeat, he again commenced the strugglesummon-&#xD;

a party of males and females advanced upon them.&#xD;
In falling she dropped the ball, and the next instant&#xD;
a kick from Billy's foot sent it whirling with the&#xD;
rapidity of a bullet past the stake.&#xD;
The victory was won, and the infant backwoods-&#xD;
man, Bunty-Billy was the victor. A shout of ex-&#xD;
ultation rent the air, and old and young crowded&#xD;
around the young man. Every one was anxious to&#xD;
take him by the hand. The eyes of the Indians&#xD;

whom he had the severest struggle, had slyly crept&#xD;
by hiside, and extending her handsome Indian&#xD;
countenance, thus addressed him:&#xD;
"You brave boy-make good warrior-great&#xD;

who tipon receiving it, bowed as. gracefully as he&#xD;
'knew how, at the same time thanking the Chief&#xD;

men left the village and continued their journey&#xD;
towards the cave of Captain Pipe, where they arri-&#xD;
ved in safety in a few days.&#xD;
The old Chief was the sole occupant of the Cav-&#xD;

upon some skins of wild animals, absorbed in deep&#xD;
meditation.&#xD;
"Good evening Captain Pipe," exclaimed each of&#xD;
the two young men, who advancing towards himin&#xD;
turn, renewed their friendship by a hearty shake&#xD;
of the hand.&#xD;
"And who is that you . bring along with you ?"&#xD;
asked the Captain.&#xD;
"This sir," said Philip, "is an orphan boy named&#xD;
William Buntly, but whom we call "Buaty .glly."&#xD;
His residence was on the BlackForkwhere he&#xD;
lived with martin Ruffner, to    hewas bound.&#xD;

"Ah, indeed," replied the Captain, "and is this'&#xD;

"Yes sir," said Philip, "and a more manly heart&#xD;

'2Vne, nove,' replied the old man pensively, nor&#xD;

Philip sighed heavily, repeating the Chieftain's&#xD;
answer: "None, none." Then pausing, while tears&#xD;
started in his eyes, a deep and solemn silence, for&#xD;
a few moments reigied in that subterranean recess.&#xD;
" gone, none," repeated the young man, after a&#xD;
fe ,,nment's pause. Then turning to Alfred, who&#xD;

on the bank of the river.-The party had proceed-&#xD;
ed as far as Middle'Bass Island, but found -they&#xD;
could proceed no further, in consequence of the&#xD;
breaking up of the ice. They, therefore abandon-&#xD;
ed the enterprise, and returned to Fort Meigs:&#xD;
During their retreat, three young men deserted&#xD;
them,. retraced their"steps towards Maiden, and&#xD;
while encamped in the woods a few miles, from this&#xD;
post, they were. surprised by a party of Indians and&#xD;
taken as prisoners -to Malden. It is' needless to&#xD;
say that these prisoners were none others than&#xD;
Philip Seymour; Alfred Bradley and Bunty-Billy.*&#xD;
Fort Maiden, the place to which our heroes were&#xD;
taken, was situated on the east bank of P etroit&#xD;
River, on the Canada side, and was oMiginally&#xD;
under the command o    General Brock, to whom&#xD;
Gen. Hull surrendered his army. Shortly after-&#xD;
wards Brook was killed at the seige of Queenstown,&#xD;
after which the command fell into. the hands of&#xD;
Col. Proctor, who at this time held possession of&#xD;
Fort Maiden.&#xD;
On their arrival here, our young heroes found&#xD;
themselves in: the midst .of Indians and their, no&#xD;
less .savage foes, the British. They were immedia-&#xD;
tely -phaed under guard with quite a-number of&#xD;
other'prisoners.&#xD;
We must not forget to mention ;that the inten-&#xD;
tions of the party to which our heroes joined thern-&#xD;
selves, was anticipated by two supposed Freich-&#xD;
men wholeft Sandusky (the day before the coin-&#xD;
pany hd started on this pbrilou expedition) and&#xD;
crossed 'the ice to Malden, and gave Proctor the&#xD;
alarm. The British General immediately sent out&#xD;
his India scouts to watch their 'movements, and&#xD;
coning upon our heroes, as they lay in camp under&#xD;
the outh of Huron River, took them prisoners'&#xD;

-Proctor paid them a visit in person, and interroga-&#xD;
ted them  as to their business in this region.&#xD;
Philip told them  they were hunters, and their&#xD;
business was that of hunting-that they were from&#xD;
the Black Fork in Ohio, and that-they had missed&#xD;
their way, being in an uninhabited wilderness.&#xD;
Proctor' had them searched in hope of finding some&#xD;
papers about them which might prove them to be&#xD;
spies. But in this, he failed, and he gave orders&#xD;
to keep. them under guard until he ordered other-&#xD;
wise. He then left for the purpose of holding a&#xD;
conference with Tecumseh. The next morning&#xD;
Proctor, accompanied by Tecumseh, paid them&#xD;
another visit.&#xD;
On his first appearance Philip and Alfred were&#xD;
deeply impressed with the person of Tecumseh--&#xD;
it was the first time they had seen him. There&#xD;
was something about his whole person which wad&#xD;
truly commanding. Philip gazd upon this noble&#xD;
looking Chief with feelings bordering upon awe ;&#xD;
and no wonder, for Tecumseh was the most extra-&#xD;
ordinary Chief that ever appeared in history.. He&#xD;
was by birth a Shawanoes, and under other circum-&#xD;
stances would had been .an honor to the.world.&#xD;
He was, epadowed by nature with the attributes of&#xD;
mind necessary for great political combinations.. It&#xD;
was he who formed the grand scheme of uniting all&#xD;
he, tribes east of the Mississippiinto hostility&#xD;
against the U:. States.. This. enterprise' he com-&#xD;
nieneed as early as 1809, andup till the ,war, he&#xD;
had insiguanted himself by his adroitness, eloquence&#xD;
and courage, into every tribe from Michilinackin-&#xD;
nok to Georgia. By his eloquence and cunning-&#xD;
ness, he played upon the feelings and superstitions&#xD;
of his race ; and carried with him 'a red stick, which&#xD;
he, represented as possessing mgical properties,&#xD;
the acqeptaneg f. whichwas. considered .as joining&#xD;
his party. From this circumstance the name. "Red&#xD;
BSlicks" was .appliedtt.all Indians, hodtile to the&#xD;
United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
I*&#xD;
&#xD;
Tecumseh on approaching our heroescast upon&#xD;
them a; deep and searching glance. His fiery eye&#xD;
serit a thrill of horror into the hearts of all but&#xD;
Billy, who sat unmoved by this powerful chief.&#xD;
Col. Proctor made strict interrogations of Philip&#xD;
concerning the forces and intentions of General&#xD;
Harrison. Philip told him that as to his intentions&#xD;
he knew nothing ; as he. supposed that none but&#xD;
his .staff officers knew:them; but as to his forces&#xD;
they were daily increasing-as he passed near the&#xD;
mouth of the Maumee river a~few days ago; he ac-&#xD;
eidently came upon his forces, at a vacated camp&#xD;
fire, on the north 'bank of the river, where he&#xD;
(Harrison) was joined by a large body of troops-&#xD;
that after being examined by' Harrison's officers he&#xD;
was permitted to proceed on his hunting expedi-&#xD;
tion&#xD;
This statement Proctor knew was true,.and he&#xD;
gave orders to treat the prisoners kindly. He&#xD;
offered them the hospitalities of his fort, but com-&#xD;
manded that a vigilant watch be kept upon them.&#xD;
The party was then conducted to the quarters of&#xD;
Tecumseh. Here Philip and his companions held&#xD;
a council, in which it was agreed that they would&#xD;
remain on the peninsula till the breaking up of&#xD;
winter, and then effect their escape.&#xD;
Philip sought every opportunity to enquire after&#xD;
Lilly, without giving any cause of. suspicion. His&#xD;
anxious eyes closely scrutinized every group of&#xD;
women ; which caused many enquiring glances to&#xD;
be cast upon him by those dark eyed forest daugh,&#xD;
ters.&#xD;
Time rolled on;- and' nothing was heard of the&#xD;
young maiden. It is not necessary to tax the&#xD;
readers patience 'with a recital of the feelings and&#xD;
anxieties of Philip, during that gloomy winter, at&#xD;
Fort Malden. The reader's imagination must sup-&#xD;
ply the place of description.&#xD;

April, Philip and his companions were seated upon&#xD;
the banks of the river in sight of the Fort. The&#xD;
severity of the weather had moderated, and balmy&#xD;
spring'was hastening on.&#xD;
"Alfred," said Philip, "I'm afraid these Indians&#xD;
and British will; yet overpower the Americans&#xD;
Proctor and Tecumseh are now making the most&#xD;
extensive preparations. for the seige of Ft. Meigs,&#xD;
and they seem sanguine of success."&#xD;
"I have no fears of that," replied Alfred, "Gen,&#xD;
Harrison, is not going to let them drive him from&#xD;
his post---mark that."&#xD;
"Not if I were there," replied Billy, half in jest&#xD;
and the'other half in earnest, I'll bet my life againth&#xD;
thuppenth hapenny that I can make every red&#xD;
devil of themrun."&#xD;
"No doubt of it Billy-none in the least," said&#xD;
Philip, "but you would have to run first."&#xD;
"Thod blatht yor," said Billy, "I'll "&#xD;
"Hold, hold Billy," said Philip in a whisper, "see&#xD;
there are some Indian wonen coming towards us."&#xD;
"You Tecumseh's prisoners ?" asked one of them.&#xD;
"Yes,. maglam," replied Philip, bowing gracefully to&#xD;
theryoung squaw.&#xD;

stant putting a slip of paper intohis hands, and&#xD;
then passed on,&#xD;

Then pausing, Philip gazed for a moment into&#xD;
the face of his companions, while a profusion of&#xD;
tears rolled down his cheeks.&#xD;
The scene was deeply affecting, and Billy and&#xD;
Alfred mingled their tears with his.&#xD;
At the appointed hour Philip was inside the&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIII.&#xD;
INTERVIEW WITH LILLY PIPE-PLANS FOR ESCAPE.&#xD;
'Twas such a night as might have flung,&#xD;
It's robe o'er primal nature's bower&#xD;
On that blest night, the hunter found&#xD;
His long lost love, the forest flower.&#xD;
The joy and happiness produced in the minds of&#xD;
Philip and 'Lilly, at their meeting in the garrison&#xD;
at Maiden, we ,hall not attempt to 'describe. Lan-&#xD;
guage is too meagre to express the emotions, which&#xD;
naturally arise in the minds:of kindred spirits, on&#xD;
meeting,' under such circumstances.&#xD;
.As Philp entered the apartment, the beautiful&#xD;
Lilly met his astonished gaze.&#xD;
There she sat alone--beautiful as when he had&#xD;
first seen her 'under Hemlook Fall, in Richland&#xD;
county.&#xD;
"Dearest Lilly," exclaimed the aatonished and&#xD;
somewhat bewildered Philip, as he ,oened the&#xD;
door of her hub le'apatien--" dearest Lilly"&#xD;
repeated he,,7and springing to her, clasped her in&#xD;
his armhs; wile tears of joy rn' down 'his manly&#xD;
cheeks-   ',1&#xD;
The happiness which the younghunter this mo-&#xD;
ment experienced we shall lea e the' reader to im-&#xD;
agine. For a moment neither of the ,lovers could'&#xD;
speak: but . that silence was ,big with feeliug-a&#xD;
feeling, too,.which was inexpressiblydeep. Months&#xD;
&#xD;
of painful anxiety had tortured their minds, they&#xD;
both had drank deeply from afflictions bitter cup:&#xD;
but for all their past woes, the present interview&#xD;
was an ample attonement, and forgetting. the past,&#xD;
they rejoiced over the present. As soon as the&#xD;
young man could command his feelings he thus ad-&#xD;
dressed 'his "fair one."&#xD;
"Dearest Lilly, "I am indeed happy- too happy;&#xD;
I havenot deserved of Heaven so great, a joy as&#xD;
this. The highest -hope, which ever pictured the&#xD;
future earth to me, never toldme of bliss like this.&#xD;
Lily; didst thou ever pray for me? 'I have' for&#xD;
thee  and I' have felt that my prayers, which I&#xD;
have tremblingly whispered in the ear. of Heaven,&#xD;
would be wafted to thy ears by some; bright angelic&#xD;
minister, the guardian spirit of thy footsteps on&#xD;
earth. Often times, dark gloomy shadows came&#xD;
across my mind ; but then I was consoled to know&#xD;
that the eye which never sleeps would witch and&#xD;
protect thy pure and innocent spirit, though. lost&#xD;
to human sight in the untraversed worlds through-&#xD;
out the depths of unmeasuranble space. Nay, more&#xD;
I haye felt 'that should I not have found that here&#xD;
on earth, my oWn soul would have caught a spark&#xD;
of God's own essence, whose' whole being is love,&#xD;
which would have lighted me on, follwing, thy&#xD;
flight through the cycles of eternity ; thi would&#xD;
have lit up the dark wilderness o f worlds and i-&#xD;
luminated the voids of space,&#xD;
"iWhere gravitation wenia to turn the other way.&#xD;
'Yea, dearest Lillyy thi&amp;amp;would have lent bright-&#xD;
ness to the'eyes of my soul, so that Iiwould have&#xD;
recognized thy 'angel face i   a land of darkest&#xD;
shadows, though around thy form hovered the in-&#xD;
habitantis'of'cogegated worlds, multitudenous'as&#xD;
the countess millions of :notes; which float in the&#xD;

the same devoted feeling, and she replied&#xD;
"Phf'lip Seymour-fyour kindness toone so un-&#xD;

"All is 'well- captain Pipe is well. Give your-&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIIII.&#xD;
ESCAPE FROM MALDEN-BATTLE WITH INDIANS.&#xD;
&#xD;
In the course of an hour, Philip and his com-&#xD;
panions were seated on the. banks of the' river.&#xD;
The night was dark, &amp;amp;nd the heavens were pouring&#xD;
down their watery treasures. Here they remained&#xD;
'nearly an hour before Lilly made her appearance.&#xD;
At last their eyes fell upon 'the outline 'of a human&#xD;
form, moving towards them through the darkness&#xD;
of the night. That forn' was Lilly's. She had&#xD;
passed the guards in safety, attired in male cos-&#xD;
tume. Noiselessly the little party entered one of&#xD;
the boats, and under the darkness of the night,&#xD;
with Bpuch- difficulty and no little danger, they&#xD;
moored Their vessel on the.opposite side of the&#xD;
rivers Stepping' on -shore,. 'they commenced their&#xD;
journey through 'what is now called Monroe Co.,&#xD;
Michigan, bordering on the Lake - shore. ' The&#xD;
weather being 'wet and considerable rain having&#xD;
fallen, their -march was anything but: agreeable.&#xD;
Besides they were; in the heart of an enemy's&#xD;
country, and exposed to the incursions of their&#xD;
savage foes. Towardsmorning they encamped in&#xD;
a dense thicket, almost surrdunded by a swamp.&#xD;

No, no, said Philip, "you need have no fears&#xD;
of that; -these Indians are not hostile 'to- the&#xD;
American cause- otherwise they would not have&#xD;
made such an onslaught on their red brethren."&#xD;
"Ah, but," replied Lilly, "you can not- be&#xD;
certain which of the two parties, if 'any, are our&#xD;
friends."&#xD;
The evidence of the dying savage will determine&#xD;

SATTLE A' FORT MEIGS&#xD;

r* '"4&#xD;
&#xD;
One dark and windy .night, in the month 'of&#xD;
April, 1813. one 'Capt. Wm. Oliver in 'company&#xD;
with-a young Kentuckian, left Fort Meigs for, Ft.&#xD;
Findly, a distance of about thirty-three miles. ' It&#xD;
was about nine o'clock when they started on their&#xD;
journey, which at this period, was cenuidered ex-&#xD;
trenely perilous,-They had not' proceeded: far&#xD;
when they came suddenly in sight of an Indian&#xD;
camp, around the fires of which the savages were&#xD;
busy preparing their suppers. They had approach-&#xD;
ed within disturbing distance of' the savages, ho,&#xD;
on hearing the noise of their horses hoofs, sprang&#xD;
to their feet and with savage yells atackedthen.&#xD;
On hearing their yells,.they reined;their ?horses&#xD;
into the branches of a fallen tree. 'The: horses, as&#xD;
if conscious of the danger,,stood perfectly'still.&#xD;
The Indians supposing them 'to have retreated&#xD;
towards the Fort pursued, them, passing around&#xD;
the tree without making any discovery of them in&#xD;

&#xD;
the thick darkness. As soon as the Indians had&#xD;
gone some distance, they put spurs to their horses&#xD;
and dashed forward through the woods through&#xD;
which they passed all the way to their destination,&#xD;
where they arrived safely with the exceptionof.&#xD;
their, clothes, which were torn into rags by, bushes&#xD;
and brambles. In this rapid flight they received&#xD;
quite a number of contusions against the trees,&#xD;
leaving several marks upon their bodies. They&#xD;
had scarcely made secure their flight into the Fort&#xD;
when the Indians also made their appearance ; but&#xD;
they were too late for their prey, and consequently&#xD;
commenced a retreat.&#xD;
The next day a party of soldiers accompanied&#xD;
the Captain and his companion' back to Fort Meigs,&#xD;
when theCaptain made known to the officers .his&#xD;
night journey through the wilderness.&#xD;
"The. damn 'red sticks," exclaimeda tall, young.&#xD;
Indian Chief, "me hunt 'em up-me give 'em what&#xD;
white man call "'ticklar h--l."  And so saying, he&#xD;
called around him his, young and fiery warriors,&#xD;
axed. acter addressing them for a few moments in his&#xD;
owndl'nguage, they left the Fort amid the cheers.&#xD;
of the;4ericana.&#xD;

&#xD;
the brow of one of the banks of the, ravine,they&#xD;
lay down fatupon the ground, awaiting therresait&#xD;
of their observation.&#xD;
. As the Indians lay in this position, Beaver and&#xD;
his party, who had been, closelypursuing them, ad-&#xD;
vaned upon them, arranging his men in the most&#xD;
favorable position, commanded them to make sure&#xD;
of. heir prey.&#xD;
At thesignal of their commander, the deep&#xD;
silence of that'wilderness was broken by. the sharp&#xD;
reports of the death-dealing rifles, ringing thiiough&#xD;
that dark forest ; and the mingled yelled of nearly&#xD;
three score of savages rose above the din of battle.&#xD;
The prostrate Indians were perfectly panig strick-&#xD;
en ; and those who survived the onset sprang to&#xD;
their feet and bounding down the bank of the ra-&#xD;
vine, endeavored to make their escape as best they&#xD;
could throughthe deep darkness of the night.&#xD;
Beaver and his warriors pursued them down the&#xD;
ravine for some distance; but loosing sight of them&#xD;
after they had followed them several miles, return-&#xD;
ed to the place where. theyhad attacked then.&#xD;
On theirreturn Philip recognized the noble hearted&#xD;
Oief, to whom he made himself and party known,&#xD;
and under whose protection ,he placed himself aid&#xD;

had not enjoyed much rest for some nights previous,,&#xD;
and 4hey signalized;their wish to enjoy a few hours.&#xD;
sleep ; accordingly, thqv lay down upon their blank-&#xD;
ets, under cover of a tent, before a blazing fire and&#xD;
slept soundly till inorning.&#xD;
As the light of day broke in upon the forest, the&#xD;
Indians were astir, and after plundering the dead&#xD;
of their arms and clothing, they started for the cave&#xD;
of Captain 'Pipe, in company with Philip and his&#xD;
companions.&#xD;
Before leaving the camp, Philip informed Beaver&#xD;
of the conversation which Alfred had held- with a&#xD;
dying  Indian, after the battle.   Whereupon&#xD;
Beaver had his body brought into the camp for&#xD;
burial.&#xD;
Lily and Philip on beholding him were. no little&#xD;
astonished to find him to be no other than the re-&#xD;
pulsive and bloody Kanotchy, the murderer of Kate&#xD;
Seymour.&#xD;
"Great God !" exclaimed Lilly, "this is the same&#xD;
Indian who tore me away from my devoted father-&#xD;
this is the merciless and unfeeling Kanotchy. My&#xD;
prayer is answered-the curse of' Heaven has fallen&#xD;
upon him, and he has met his fate in a moment&#xD;
last 'expected. Poor fellow !" said she, "after all&#xD;
I cannot help pitying him."&#xD;
"Pity the devil !" said. Billy, "ith a pity he had'nt&#xD;
thucked'himthelf to death thortly' after he came to&#xD;
life on the 'thage of action."&#xD;
For a fewmoments Philip and Lilly stood gazing&#xD;
upon the lifeless remains of this bloody savage,&#xD;
while thoughts of other days rose fresh in their&#xD;
memories. Before them lay the murderer of Kate,&#xD;
and the abducted of Lilly, but the arm which had&#xD;
struck the fatal blow was now paralyzed by the&#xD;
ha d of death.&#xD;
Philip on first beholding the wretch, had his&#xD;
feelings wrought up to a high pitch 'of excitement,&#xD;
and could scarcely refrain from hewing his body to&#xD;
&#xD;
pieces; but a sober reflection taught him that such&#xD;
an act would not satisfy the demands of vengeance.&#xD;
After hastily despositing him with his dead eom-&#xD;
panions, the party left the camp and proceeded to&#xD;
the cave of Captain Pipe, where they. arrived a&#xD;
little after night fall. Beaver and his warriors&#xD;
had accompanied them within a few miles of their&#xD;
destination, and then retraced their steps to Harri-&#xD;
son's Head Quarters.&#xD;

CAPT. PIPE MEETING S WITH HIS DAUGHTE--EXPECTED ATTACK&#xD;
OF THE BRITISH.&#xD;
"Kind Heaven, whose power no being can control&#xD;
Hath sent her back to cheer the Chieftain's soul."&#xD;
The pleasure and happiness which Capt. Pipe&#xD;
experienced at the meeting of his daughter cannot&#xD;
be pictured.&#xD;
We admire the sentiment expressed by the poetic&#xD;
Dryden, in one of his celebrated odes, when. he&#xD;
says&#xD;
"Sweet is pleasure after pain."&#xD;
This sentiment .the reader has, no doubt, often&#xD;
experienced. In most instances, the, pleasure we&#xD;
receive, after undergoing days, months or years of&#xD;
painful anxieties, is heightened with the contrast&#xD;
of 'the past. We look back on the past, and re-&#xD;
member .its struggles--the difficulties, privations&#xD;
and sorrows with which we had to contend ; and&#xD;
contrasting them with our emancipation from them&#xD;
all, we seem to realize an extent of pleasurable&#xD;
sensations beyond our most sanguine expectations.&#xD;

During .this affecting colloquy, Philip and his&#xD;
companions had remained silent; but their feelings&#xD;
were in harmony with the old man and his affee-&#xD;
tion ate daughter. The interview was of the most&#xD;
affe acting nature: and the young men, though silent,&#xD;
we p't like children.&#xD;
Th e Captain then turned to the young hunters,&#xD;
and thus addressed them:&#xD;
"Gentlemen, to you I am indebted for the heart-&#xD;
felt happiness I this moment experience. You&#xD;
have brought to my soul a world of joy in returning&#xD;
to me this dear creature. It is not in my power to&#xD;
reward you pecuniarily for this great service which&#xD;
you have tendered me. Gold and' silver possess&#xD;
no merits to requite this act of kindness.  The&#xD;
wealth of the world is but a 'poor remuneration;&#xD;
and' I cannot estimate this act of humanity, only by&#xD;
the standard of eternal happiness, which I pray&#xD;
the Great Spirit to confer upon you all. You have&#xD;
encountered and triumphed over the thousand dif-&#xD;
ficulties and perils which beset 'the lives of pio-&#xD;
neers-others would have grown weary and dis-&#xD;
couraged, and abandoned the enterprise as hope-&#xD;
less and reckless. But in you, I find all the ele-&#xD;
ments necessary for carrying out any undertaking,&#xD;
however seemingly impracticable. And here permit&#xD;
me tosay to you, that this act of kindness shall be&#xD;
remunerated."&#xD;
"Captain," exclaimed Philip, I thank you most&#xD;
affectionately for the distingiished consideration&#xD;
with which jyou so generously regard myompan-&#xD;
ions and myselff. You speak of remuneration, Sir,&#xD;
I aux alre aly 'remunerated  LIhave been fully&#xD;
comperis ted for all the difficulties and. rangers&#xD;
through, wideh I have passed in performing. this&#xD;
duly. The gratification arising from the knoWl-&#xD;
edge of one's having rendered his fellow 'man a&#xD;
service when he nmst s tas in need' of it, is a bet-&#xD;
ter remuneration than all the riches of the world,&#xD;
&#xD;
With you sir, I too can rejoice, and with you too,&#xD;
I can weep."&#xD;
"Venerable sir," said Alfred, "I am happy to ex-&#xD;
press my thanks to you for your favorable opinion&#xD;
of myself'. This distinguished consideration isdully&#xD;
appreciated; and here. permit me toatsure.:you&#xD;
that in addition to what little I have alreadgedone&#xD;
to secure the'happiness of you and your daughter,&#xD;
I am willing to go upon any errand of mercy or&#xD;
humanity you may bepleased to.send ie."&#xD;
"Thee here, Mr. Alf, by the mother of Motheth,&#xD;
and that haintha thaying anything bad about.the&#xD;
gall-th,-I'll go with you--even tho far ath to the-&#xD;
thouth gate of the bottomleth pit, on thuch an er-&#xD;

During the conversation Lilly had been seated&#xD;
by the-side of her father, now and then wiping&#xD;
the tears from her eyes,,as she listened to expres-&#xD;
sionsrof the high ;r ga rd :for her happiness mani-&#xD;

father; and for your valuable services. he will&#xD;
richly reward you, by driving the white rebels off&#xD;
your land restoring them to you. It is now our.&#xD;
intention to storm Fort Meigs, the Head Quarters&#xD;
of General Harrison, and in this undertaking your&#xD;
services are indispensably necessary. Youchave&#xD;
about one thousand warriors under your camihand,&#xD;
which you will please place in such positions, as are&#xD;
best adapted to their mode of fighting; and bid&#xD;
to remember that the standing orders of the seige&#xD;
are 'no quarters to the d -n rebels.'&#xD;
"Sir," replied the noble Chief, "I lift up my'&#xD;
hatchet only to save the lives of my people and&#xD;
protect my country ; and under this consideration&#xD;
I am ready to follow you to battle."&#xD;
"well said Proctor, "it is for you alone that&#xD;
the-King has sent his'subjects here. They come to&#xD;
help you regain your lands from these plundering&#xD;
white rebels,"&#xD;
In the course of ten or twelve days after this&#xD;
conversation one afternoon as the forces of Gen.&#xD;
lJarrison were gathered together on parade before&#xD;
the: camp,: 'Bunty, Billy came running up to one' of&#xD;
the officers, exclaiming:&#xD;
"Thee. here, Mither officer," pointing his, finger&#xD;
towards two strangers on the opposite side of the&#xD;
river, "thee there's two thuthpithious looking fel-&#xD;
lowth thanding on the other aside of the river, ean't&#xD;
you give em as thuitable invitation to pay you a&#xD;
nearer vithet.".&#xD;
"Certainly my little, man,". said the officer ; ,and&#xD;
turning this  n, bade them clear the battery,&#xD;
and lt'rthwith the engine was pointed towards thern,&#xD;
and the next moment the earth was seen flying&#xD;
about them in all directions.&#xD;
By the beard of ,Mahomet," exclaimed .the&#xD;
icer, "that was an admirable shot. See !.the&#xD;
devils are off like a hurricane-straight for an-&#xD;
~ada."&#xD;
&#xD;
Happy it would have been for many a*.gallant&#xD;
hero, had that missile brought death to those two&#xD;
Chieftains, who were none others than Proctor, and&#xD;
Tecumseh:&#xD;
Some time after dark of the same night, three&#xD;
young Cnen entered Fort Meigs  ith :te startling&#xD;
intelligence that a large body of British and&#xD;
Indians had landed their forces on the hill on the&#xD;
north side of the river, and were busily engaged in&#xD;
erecting their batteries preparatory to an attack&#xD;
the next morning.&#xD;
Morning came, revealing to. the General, the&#xD;
army of Proctor and Tecumseh on a commanding&#xD;
eminence on the opposite of the river ;the main&#xD;
part being stationed at the old English Fort, some&#xD;
distance below.&#xD;
On one bank of that turbid stream were.stationed&#xD;
the haughty legions. of Proctor, and his bloody&#xD;
allies, the merciless Indians; on the other was.the&#xD;
gallant Harrison and his hardy pioneers.&#xD;
'Twas morning-a lovely May morning.. The&#xD;
golden sun was wheeling up his chariot..cf light&#xD;
above the tinted horizon. The mingled melodies&#xD;
of the woodland minstrels were floating upon ;the&#xD;
soft and balmy morning air, filling the forest with&#xD;
the most enchanting strain; little dreaming of. the&#xD;
horrible storm  of war then gathering ,in deadly&#xD;
g1o6m over that garden vale of the Maumee.&#xD;
Hark 'tis the trump of war-=-the cannon's mighty&#xD;
roar. The siege has now commenced : and can-&#xD;
non answers to -threcaboming cannon's roar, wbjle&#xD;
the firm, solid earth seems to tremble under the&#xD;
mighty shock, for three successive days.&#xD;
"See! General," exlam ed one of .the. offers,&#xD;
"the Indians have crossed the river and are as-&#xD;

infinite delight of his companions. On examination&#xD;
the shell was found to be filled with inflammable&#xD;
matter, which once ignited would have wrapped&#xD;
the whole building in one sheet of luri4 flame.&#xD;
This circumstance, it is said, lent wings to their&#xD;
shovels, and with the loss of some of their compan-&#xD;
ions the work was soon completed.&#xD;
On the night of the 4th of May, about 12 o'clock,&#xD;
a messenger arrived at Fort Meigs, bringing the&#xD;
welcome intelligence of the near arrival of General&#xD;
Clay,'with his brave Kentuckians-that he was&#xD;
within two hour's march of' the Fort.-Harrison&#xD;
had been daily expecting him, and on receiving&#xD;
this intelligence sent orders for him to land eight&#xD;
hundred of his men on the right bank, take, posses-&#xD;
sion of and spike their cannon, and then immedia-&#xD;
tely return to their boats and cross the river and&#xD;
seek protection in the Fort.. The remainder of his&#xD;
forces were to land on the left bank and fight their way&#xD;
to the Fort, while sorties were to be made from the&#xD;
garrison in aid of this operation. Col. Dudley being&#xD;
eldest in command, led the van. He effected the&#xD;
landing of his men without difficulty, and executed&#xD;
the orders of his General, after which he called&#xD;
upon his men to fly to the boats ; but they dis-&#xD;
obeyed his orders, and sent up a shout of triumph;&#xD;
and permitted themselves to be drawn in ambush&#xD;
by the Indians.&#xD;
General Harrison and some of his officers were&#xD;
standing upon the grand battery, and, seeing the&#xD;
danger into which the infatuated soldiers of Col.&#xD;
Dudley were plunging themselves, beckoned them&#xD;
to return ; but the soldiers supposing them  to be&#xD;
returning the cheers, they reiterated their shouts&#xD;
of triumph.-Harrison seeing 'their reckless infatua,&#xD;
tion, cried out in tones of deepest anguish-&#xD;

This was attempted, but before the gallant young&#xD;
men had reached the middle of the river, the Brif&#xD;
ish and Indians had cut off their retreat, and now&#xD;
the work cf death had commenced. They now saw&#xD;
their hopeless condition. The red hounds of hell&#xD;
came pouring round the terror stricken soldiers&#xD;
in overwhelming numbers, while their shouts and&#xD;
yells rent the forest with the most appalling din.&#xD;
The battle now commence ir  -earnest, and hand&#xD;
to hand and face to face they fought and fell. The&#xD;
Americans were defeated and surrendered themselves&#xD;
prisoners of war. As their arms were taken from&#xD;
them, the mingled yells of that wood full of savages&#xD;
rose high above the cannon's roar, echoing through&#xD;
that wilderness, like the dismal shout of ten thous-.&#xD;
and devils in the gloomy caverns of perdition.&#xD;
They were lost !&#xD;
The prisoners were given up to the tender mer-&#xD;
cies of the savages who after contlucting them  to&#xD;
the old garrison, commenced the work of butchery,&#xD;
under the eyes, of the loathsome and detestable&#xD;
Procter.' The work of death had commenced, and&#xD;
the red current of life was soon flowing from the&#xD;
bodies of the mangled wretches.&#xD;
While this was going on, a raging thundering&#xD;
voice was heard in a distance, and the next mo-&#xD;
ment a bold and graceful chief reined his fiery steed&#xD;
in their midst, and dismounted near 'where two of&#xD;
his brethren were in the act of murdering a prison-&#xD;
er. He seized one by the throat, and the other by&#xD;
the breast, and with one powerful effort threw them&#xD;
to the ground. Then drawing his tomahawk and&#xD;
scalping knife, he ran between the prisoners and&#xD;
the Indians with the fury of a madman-. and dared&#xD;
any of the hundreds which surrounded him to at-&#xD;
tempt to murder 'another white prisoner. Then&#xD;
turning round he exclaimed :&#xD;
"Where is Gen'I Proctor ?"&#xD;

I&#xD;

Proctor, who was standing at a short distance off&#xD;
conversing with an Indian Chief, exclaimed in a&#xD;
cowardly tone ;&#xD;
"Here I am."&#xD;
'Then sir," replied the distinguished Chief,.&#xD;
" why don't you stop this inhuman butchery ?"&#xD;
"/Sir," replied this cowardly human brute, "your&#xD;
Indians cannot be controlled,"&#xD;
* Begone then from my sight," retorted the noble&#xD;
hearted savage ; "You are not fit to command-go&#xD;
and put on petticoats."&#xD;
This cutting reproof stung Proctor to the heart,&#xD;
he bit his lips with rage, but had not the manhood&#xD;
to reply, and returning to his savage companion&#xD;
renewed the conversation ;&#xD;
"Captain Montour," said Proctor, "I shall look&#xD;
for you at your post at the- appointed time. The&#xD;
Indian bowed his assent, and the next moment put-&#xD;
ting spurs to his horse, he dashed off rapidly to-&#xD;

CHAPTER     XXXVII.&#xD;
CAPTAIN MONTOUR SURPRISED AT LILLY)S ESCAPE--ANOTHER&#xD;
ATTACK ON FORT MEIGS..&#xD;
He sought in vain the maiden fair-&#xD;
His prize had gone-he knew not whore.&#xD;
Captain Montour, mentioned in the last chapter,&#xD;
was originally from Black Fork in Richland county..&#xD;
He belonged to the Delawares at Greentown. This&#xD;
Indian was highly intellectual, and had graduated&#xD;
at Cannonsburgh college. He was a sharp, shrewd&#xD;
villian. On being made acquainted with' the his-&#xD;
tory of his race, he found that they had been great.&#xD;
ly imposed upon by the whites. This knowledge&#xD;
embittered.him  against the whites, and he only&#xD;
waited an opportunity to direct his influence against&#xD;
them. The opportunity was offered in the last war&#xD;
with England. Some time during the year of 1811,&#xD;
Tecumseh paid him a visit at Greentown, and with&#xD;
the promise of being promoted to office he secured&#xD;
his services. Montour sought an interview with&#xD;
Captain Pipe, in hopes of securing his influence on&#xD;
the side of Tecumseh ; but the Captain treated his&#xD;
proposal with contempt, alleging as his reason for&#xD;
so doing the consideration of the fact that helhad&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
PIONEER LIFE.&#xD;
&#xD;
247&#xD;
&#xD;
signed the treaty at Greenville in 1795, at which&#xD;
time he had pledged his honor that he would,for-&#xD;
ever afterwards maintain his integrity.&#xD;
This enraged the haughty Chief, and he vowed&#xD;
vengeance. Hitherto Montour had been on term's&#xD;
of friendship with Captain Pipe, and had endeavor-&#xD;
ed to insinuate himself into the favor and esteem&#xD;
of his daughter Onishishsha.&#xD;
Mont our was a handsome and 'intelligent Indiat,&#xD;
and' Lilly had sbown him some respect, (but enter-&#xD;
tained no sentiments of love for him,) but on his&#xD;
attempt to dissuade the mind of her parent from in-&#xD;
tegrity, she became highly incensed against him,&#xD;
end abruptly left his company. Shortly afterwards&#xD;
Montour left Black Fork,, and threw himself under&#xD;
the protection of the British government in Canada,&#xD;
where he received the commission of captain.&#xD;
As soon as the war broke out, this perfidious vil-&#xD;
lian sought every opportunity to wreak his venge-&#xD;
ance on Captain Pipe, who had as he conceived,&#xD;
offered him a base insult. To attempt to take the&#xD;
life of the Captain he knew would not do, as it&#xD;
would call down upon him the vengeance of many&#xD;
who, though opposed to the American cause, Were&#xD;
nevertheless his firm friends,&#xD;
He had sought the hand of Lilly, but she had&#xD;
indignantly refused him; and he determined to&#xD;
wrest her from her father. by force. .For this pur-&#xD;
pose he engaged the service of the bloody Kanot-&#xD;
chy, and some others. Kapotchy was instructed to&#xD;
watch the movements of Captain Pipe, and com-&#xD;
municate the same to Montour. Accordingly, as&#xD;
soon as Kanotchy learned that Captain Pipe had&#xD;
determined, to remove to Cleveland, he sent Mon-&#xD;
tour the, intelligence, requesting him to meet him&#xD;
on the bank of the Lake near Cleveland.&#xD;
Kanotchy and his accomplices followed the Capt.&#xD;
,and, his daughter to Cleveland, and on'tly following&#xD;
evening found Lilly alone as she was seated upon&#xD;

the bank of the Lake, and approaching her, seized&#xD;
her in his arms and bore her off to Montour, who&#xD;
having all things in readiness, hastened away with&#xD;
her to Malden, where she was found by Philip and&#xD;
his companions. Kanotchy with his companions im-&#xD;
mediately returned to Black Fork'in order to elude&#xD;
suspicion, where we have found him engaged after-&#xD;
wards in the outrages committed in that region.&#xD;
On arrival .at Fort Malden, after the first siege&#xD;
of Fort Meigs, Montour was no little surprised on&#xD;
finding that his intended victim had escaped. She&#xD;
was missing. Th made strict inquiry as to her dis-&#xD;
appearance, but could gain no information respect-&#xD;
ing her elopement, and he almost came to the con-&#xD;
clusion that some invisible agent had aided her in&#xD;
escaping, as she had repeatedly told him that un-&#xD;
seen guardians were daily attending her footsteps,&#xD;
and that the Great Spirit to whom  she had com-&#xD;
mitted her entire being would some day visit him&#xD;
and all the others concerned in her abduction with&#xD;
condign punishment.&#xD;
Montour spent the greater part of the day in&#xD;
searching for information respecting Lilly, but all&#xD;
to no purpose. At length he thought of the three&#xD;
prisoners, who a few weeks previous had been&#xD;
taken, into the garrison, and on enquiry, he found&#xD;
that they too, were among the missing. He further&#xD;
ascertained that two female Indians had passed by&#xD;
these prisoners, as they were seated on the shore&#xD;
of the stream, but could not ascertain their names.&#xD;
Taking these things into, consideration, the dis-&#xD;
appointed and outwitted Chief rightly inferred&#xD;
that they had been sent in search of the girl, and&#xD;
had carried their scheme into successful operation.&#xD;
Montour finding that he had been outwitted by-&#xD;
the whites became more deeply exasperated, and&#xD;
swearing vengeance upon every white man, he&#xD;
again crossed the river, and at the appointed time&#xD;
called uiyow Gen'l Proctor, and informed him of what&#xD;

&#xD;
had transpired in the Fort since they had left, and&#xD;
sgnified his willingness to hazard his life in any&#xD;
enterprise which promised th'e destruction of every.&#xD;
American rebel.&#xD;
"Well," said Proctor, "I have concluded to re&#xD;
new the siege of Fort Meigs.. Calm and deliberate&#xD;
consideration has induced me to believe that a sec-&#xD;
ond attempt will be successful. But on calling a&#xD;
council of war it was agreed not to commence the&#xD;
attack again until they had collected a sufficient&#xD;
force to take the Fort by storm. But before re-&#xD;
treating to Malden, Proctor made another demand&#xD;
on General Harrison to surrender. But Harrison&#xD;
admonished the cowardly butcherer not to repeat&#xD;
it, upon which Proctor withdrew his forces to&#xD;
Maiden, and after remaining there a.few days e-&#xD;
turned; and on the 22d day of May made another&#xD;
attack, but met with no better success than before,&#xD;
and again retreated in confusion, covered with dis-&#xD;
grace, to his Head Quarters, where he meditated&#xD;
an attack upon Fort Stephenson, on the Sandusky.&#xD;
"In a few days after the second seige .of 'Fort&#xD;
Meigs, Philip and his companions 'paid another&#xD;
visit to the cave of Captain Pipe, for, the purpose&#xD;
of persuading him to leave the cavern and 'take&#xD;
refuge in Fort Meigs. But the Captain declined,&#xD;
and gave as his reason the uncertainty of war, and&#xD;
in case of surrender or'capture, his daughter would&#xD;
meet with no mercy from the hands of her savage&#xD;
foes. He felt entire safety where he was,' as the&#xD;
cavern was unknown.&#xD;
"But go," said he, ".fight for and .defend your&#xD;
brethren, and should you fall in defending them,&#xD;
your death will be the more gloriou.&#xD;
"Oh father !", exclaimed his daughter with 'ears&#xD;
in her eyes, "he must not die."&#xD;
" My God, Mitheth Lilly," said Billy, ;" dont&#xD;

Philip, no how. If he wath to be thot, he wouldn't&#xD;
thtay that long enough to thay from you ten min-&#xD;
uth.~Darn his picturth, if he would."&#xD;
"Pshaw Billy," replied Alfred, "you're jesting:&#xD;
Philip's visits here are on business relating exclusi-&#xD;
vely to the father."&#xD;
"Mebby tho," said Billy;.."well, if thath the&#xD;
cathe,,I do athure you, it muth be moth thunderen&#xD;
urgent, for when he tharth to come, he putteth&#xD;
ahead like a thunder gutht."&#xD;
At this juncture Alfred could no longer restrain&#xD;
his " risibilities," and giving vent to his f ellings in-&#xD;
dulgecd in a paroxysm of hearty laughter.&#xD;
Come, come Billy," said Philip, "none of your&#xD;
nonsense ; your getting overly romantic since you&#xD;
made your last will and testament to your fair&#xD;
victress on the arena at the village of Wapakon-&#xD;
neta."&#xD;
As soon as Philip had finished his reply to Billy,&#xD;
he proceeded to give the old man and his daughter&#xD;
an account of the siege and affairs at Fort Meigs,&#xD;
and after remaining a day or, two with the Chief-&#xD;
tan, he and his companions again set out for the&#xD;
Fort;'for' the purpose of securing position in the&#xD;
army in which they might be the most servicable&#xD;
to their country.&#xD;
Some few days previous to the attack upon&#xD;
Fort Stephenson, Philip and his companions set&#xD;
out on a reconnoitering expedition with the in-&#xD;
tention of visiting Major Croghan at Fort Stepen-&#xD;
son.  The young men directed their steps to-&#xD;
wards the Lake shore, about twenty' miles from&#xD;
the Fort. But owing, to the numerous swamps&#xD;
and the darkness of the night they missed their&#xD;
way, and wandering in the woods, suddenly c;ame&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVIII.&#xD;
G&amp;amp;EN. HARRISON INVADING CANADA-DEATH OF TEOUMSEH.&#xD;
While clouds of sulphur compass then around&#xD;
The dead and dying strew the goryground,&#xD;
The day is lost, some in confusion fly,&#xD;
Some stand their ground and resolutely die.&#xD;
September the tenth, 1813, is a day ever memo-&#xD;
rable in the annals of American history. Two hos-&#xD;
tile armies were stationed on the opposite shores of&#xD;
the Lake, awaiting the result of the battle in dread-&#xD;
fu'l suspense. The battle was fought midway be&#xD;
tween those two armies, on Lake Erie, a few miles&#xD;
distant from the Ottawa line, between Commodore&#xD;
Perry, commander of the American fleet and. Com-&#xD;
modore 3arclay of the British fleet. At fifteen&#xD;
minutes past eleven o'clock the sound of the war&#xD;
bugle was heard stealing over the waters of that&#xD;
tranquil lake from the Detroit, the enemies head-&#xD;
most ship, ad the next moment loud and deafning&#xD;
cheers from 11 the crews rose in mid air, followed&#xD;
by the more appalling cannon's roar. The battle&#xD;
had commenced, and for three dreadful hours were&#xD;
the waters of that beautiful lake shaken, by the&#xD;
storm of battle. 'Tis over. The Americans are&#xD;
victorious, and the thunders of the battle are hush-&#xD;
&#xD;
PIONEER LIFE.            253&#xD;
&#xD;
ed in silence, save the dying moans of the mangled&#xD;
warriors strewn upon the decks.&#xD;
'T was four o'clock, when the gallant Perry, fold-&#xD;
ing up a piece of paper placed it into the hands,of&#xD;
a messenger, who leaving the scene of bloodshed,&#xD;
sped his way to Gen. Harrison and placed in his&#xD;
hands the message from Perry. Hastily tearing it&#xD;
open the General read aloud, while a breathless&#xD;
anxiety rested on the minds of his officers and&#xD;
soldiers:&#xD;
GENERAL HARR1SN-Sia: We have met the enemy&#xD;
and they are ours.&#xD;
0. H. PRaRY.&#xD;
On, hearing this welcome intelligence, one long&#xD;
and loud shout of "long live the gallant Perry,"&#xD;
rose high above   the forest trees around Fort&#xD;
Meigs.&#xD;
This brilliant victory inspired the American&#xD;
General with the most sanguine expectations of&#xD;
the full completion of all the contempleted objects&#xD;
of the expedition, and he accordingly-made, prepa-&#xD;
rations to strike the decisive blow, by invading&#xD;
Canada.&#xD;
- Accordingly the most energetic preparations&#xD;
were put in- operation, and on the morning of Sep-&#xD;
tember the 27th, the whole army, artillry, ih-&#xD;
tary stores, provisions, and troops Were ready for&#xD;
embarkation. Before starting General Harrison&#xD;
addressed his army.&#xD;
"Fellow soldiers, said he, "there is a future in&#xD;

revenge of a soldier cannot be gratified on a fallen&#xD;
enemy."         .      -&#xD;
." Towards sundown of the same day, on the site&#xD;
of Maiden, which they found in ruins, the army had&#xD;
landed in high spirits; but the enemy had aband-&#xD;
oned their strong hold, and retreated to Sandwich,&#xD;
after dismantling Malden, burning the barracks and&#xD;
navy yard, and stripping the adjacent country of&#xD;
hordes and cattle.&#xD;
As Philip once more stood upon the site.of Mal-&#xD;
den, the recollection of Lilly came fresh into his&#xD;
mind. How different the appearance now. When.&#xD;
here before, it presented a busy scene of active&#xD;
life, where groups of British and Indians were seen&#xD;
engaged in making mirthfulness and sport. Here,&#xD;
too, his eyes first rested upon Lilly after a long and&#xD;
painful absence-here on this field of ruins--even&#xD;
where he now stands he had experienced emotions&#xD;
of happiness, inexpressibly exquisite.&#xD;
But now Lilly was secure in the care of her&#xD;
father, while her captors and enemies were flying&#xD;
fugitives. Proctor and Tecumsels and their pretty&#xD;
minion, Montour, with his cowardly fellows were&#xD;
retreating up the Thames before their pursuers.&#xD;
,The troops of Harrison had advanced within&#xD;
three miles of the Moravian town, within one mile&#xD;
of the enemy.&#xD;
On he 5th: they were discovered in a skillfully&#xD;
chosen position. A narrow strip of dry land flank..&#xD;
ed by the river Thames lay on their left, and a.&#xD;
swamp on their right. This position was occupied&#xD;
by the regular :infantry arid artillery, while on the&#xD;
right    k lay Teeumseh and.his followers, on the'&#xD;
east    margin of the swamp. The position  of&#xD;
the enemy was the most judicious and advantageous;&#xD;
bt, Proctor, through eror, had formed- isy ipfan-&#xD;
try in pen order.-earrison immediately discover-&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
that the troops disposed in such order as Proptor&#xD;
had made, could not resist the charge of mounted&#xD;
men.&#xD;
At the coniiand of their gallant leader, the&#xD;
mounted men comufrienced the charge.&#xD;
Behold with what impetuosity hey rush upon&#xD;
the charging squadrons-even up to the, conne -i&#xD;
mouth, and the flashing musketry, blazing 'forth&#xD;
their fires of death-the melee of". horses- and&#xD;
riders mingled with the roar of artillery, and the&#xD;
shouts of infuria ted combattants, rushing upon&#xD;
each other, changed that hitherto , silent forest&#xD;
into a scene of excitement and daring and horror&#xD;
that made many a heart turn cold. Next came the&#xD;
piles of 'dead and dying, whose pitiful groans, re-&#xD;
vealed a world of woe in their dying agonies.&#xD;
The hiovement was .successful,--.and that firm,&#xD;
solid earth rooted line was broken, and piles of&#xD;
mangled .human flesh lay strewn: over the earth.&#xD;
Upon the left the contest raged with, most despe-&#xD;
rate and appalling severity.&#xD;
There stood the exasperated savages unwilling&#xD;
to yield the ground, while the cowardly Procter&#xD;
had fled the field leaving. Tecumseh, and his, war-&#xD;

" To, the: woods-to, the woods," shouted the ir&#xD;

one more desperate effort. A considerable body&#xD;
of Indians had collected here, and the struggle be-&#xD;

seemed doubtful.&#xD;
Heie'again were seen flaunting .banners and&#xD;

Philip and his companions had been in the heat&#xD;

of Csar and Pompey-the heart-rending scenes of&#xD;
human suffering produced throughout Asia and&#xD;
Africa by Mahomet, and the ferocious and hellish&#xD;
butchers of the Christian nations by the devilish&#xD;
Turks- I say when we call to mind all these, with&#xD;
the many horrible and bloody butcheries of modern&#xD;
times, in which innumerable cities, towns and vile&#xD;
lageshave been laid waste-provinces and empires&#xD;
overturned, and niisery and suffering entailed upon&#xD;
countless thousands of the human race-we must&#xD;
unequivocally pronounce war the most appaling&#xD;
scourge which can befall any people or nation."&#xD;
"Alfred," repliedPhilip," I am fully pursuaded&#xD;
of the fruth of your remarks. But wars and rumors&#xD;
of wars pvill exist, be they right or wrong, as long&#xD;
as the principle of wrong remains in the human&#xD;
heart. With you I have often deplored with all&#xD;

"I underthand yer," replied Billy, and wduld&#xD;

The young men, who had been seated upon -the&#xD;
trunk of a tree, arose, and passing some distance&#xD;
along the woods suddenly came upon the body of&#xD;
a wounded Indian. He had fell wounded in the ac-&#xD;
tion, aid dragging himself short 'distance, rolled&#xD;
himself into a depression of earth made by the up-&#xD;
heaval of a tree. Here lay the poor fellow, suffer-&#xD;
ing under several flesh wounds.-On seeing our&#xD;
heroes he cast upon them a pitiful look, and thus&#xD;
addressed them in good plain english:&#xD;
"Gentlemen, I am dying. My -span of life is at&#xD;
its close. This beautiful world will sqoi be hid&#xD;
from me forever. 1'Yhave fallen in lightning for the&#xD;
plundered and despoil rights of the red man. I am&#xD;
an Indian by birth, and an Indian in feeling.&#xD;
In the early settlement of this country by the&#xD;
whites the red man saw not what was to befall his&#xD;
race, and he permitted him to settle among us. We&#xD;
called him brother. But our fathers have been de-&#xD;
ceived'; and we have been treated worse than the&#xD;
brute creation. The earth was our mother and&#xD;
upon her lap we reposed ; rude wigwams sheltered&#xD;
us, and' satisfying our hunger and thirst we lay&#xD;

whence t came. One word with you before 1&#xD;
leave.&#xD;
.On the Black Fork of Mohican lied the noted&#xD;
Captain Pipe,tonce my particular friend. He has&#xD;
a beautiful daughter-I loved her ; she refused my&#xD;
hand-I managed to steal her from her father-&#xD;
again I proffered her my hand---but she scornfully&#xD;
refused it-I threatened her with violence, but she,&#xD;
defied all my threats and called upsen the curses of&#xD;
heaven to rest upon me--that prayer was like a'&#xD;
poisonous shalt sunken into my heart, and for a&#xD;
moment I trembled under her solemn denunciation&#xD;
and indignant frown,-Finding I could not gain her&#xD;
consent to wed me,'I left her presence, hoping to&#xD;
conquer her' at another period. On returning 1&#xD;
found her gone ; this enraged me, and reckless off&#xD;
of consequence I threw myself into'battle, determin-&#xD;
ed to glut my vengeance on the white -race, from&#xD;
whom her father and herself had sought protege'&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
It, may be, you may chance to see her or her&#xD;
father-nay, I would say, you would confer upon&#xD;
your dying enemy one favor, (though undeserving&#xD;
of it,) by' sending to hinm who is now in Cleveland,&#xD;
if yet living, my dying request for him and his' in-&#xD;
sulted daughter to pardon me. This act alone is&#xD;
all that niow troubles me. In fighting you'and your&#xD;
race I have done my duty, but in tearing the young.&#xD;
lady from  the protection of" her aged father to&#xD;
whom she is bound by the closest ties of affection, I&#xD;
have outraged the principles of a gentleman."&#xD;
Philip was much moved at', this confession of'&#xD;
Montour, for 'twas he who spoke, and taking him"&#xD;
by his hand, besmeared wit  blood, he raised hun&#xD;
off the ;ground, in order that he might gather some.&#xD;
leaves under his body and- head.-Then addressing&#xD;
him in the language of tenderness he said- -&#xD;
4" Siry u shalt"die with knowledge of being&#xD;
pardoned, I am acquainted with Caytain Pipe&#xD;
&#xD;
i&#xD;
t&#xD;
&#xD;
'A&#xD;
&#xD;
and his daughter.-- My name is Seymour, and my&#xD;
residence formerly was on the Black Fork, near&#xD;
Greentown, where my father's family were    all&#xD;
murdered, save myself by your brethren--like yog&#xD;
I vowed revenge--have sought and obtained it, antL&#xD;
have the satisfaction of knowing that their murder-&#xD;
ers met their just reward.-Like you sir, I have&#xD;
thrown inyself into the midst of danger and excite-&#xD;
ment, almost regardless of consequences.&#xD;
I sir, am one of the deliverers of that young&#xD;
woman of whom you speak, and these are my.com-&#xD;
panions m the iunder-taking. We have traversed&#xD;
the forests of Ohio in all directions in search of&#xD;
her; we found her in the garrison of Malden, and&#xD;
she is now happy under the protection of her&#xD;
fther ; and now sir, I want you to understand that&#xD;
you are forgiven. I speak what I kiiow-and if&#xD;
Onishishsha were here she would lay her hand&#xD;
upon your dying head, and say to you as her Divine&#xD;
Master said'to his murderers, "Father forgive him,"&#xD;
for Onishishsha is a christian.&#xD;
4iTis enough," said the dying Indian, "my breath&#xD;
grows short-it comes heavily on-darkness is&#xD;
gathering around mie--my eyes are growing dim-.&#xD;
the'objects of earth are receding from my sight-I!&#xD;
am going-farew    "            T&#xD;
"Its all over with -him,' said Philip, whose eyes&#xD;
wore.dimmed with tears,; "poor fellow! he's gone&#xD;
to join the company of his gallant comrades, and his&#xD;
noble hearted commander, who this day have bid,.&#xD;
their forest homes adieu forever."&#xD;
"Poor, fellow !' said Alfred, whose heart during&#xD;
this melancholy interview, was deeply touched by&#xD;
the Indian's melting pathos. '"Poor fellow !' re-&#xD;
peated he, "after all I cannot help mourning his&#xD;
untimely fate-what a noble looking young war'&#xD;
nrior--so much unlike his brethren-his language,&#xD;
how beautiful, and his enunciation, even under the&#xD;
pangs of death, how soft and clear. But his days&#xD;

Beyond the cloud capped hcavcns&#xD;
In verdant groves, or winding vales,&#xD;
or grassy plain-the red man's&#xD;

Well, well, said Billy, who during this sorrow-&#xD;
ful scene, had sat a sa silent spectator, and in whose&#xD;
bosom also, the fires of compassion had been kind-&#xD;
led-" I cannot but feel thorry too; after all I&#xD;
think you  did right in thpeaking kindly to th is&#xD;

"Yes Billy," said Alfred, "we must always re-&#xD;

rison, "that the revenge of a soldier cannot be grati-&#xD;
fled on a: fallen enemy. Acts of kindness' under&#xD;
such circumstances is the noblest revenge, as they&#xD;
leave no unpleasant feelings behind them."&#xD;
Thus ended the conversation, and the young&#xD;
heroes again joined the soldiers in the camp where&#xD;
the officers were making preparations to bury the&#xD;
dead.&#xD;
The day after the battle the American troops&#xD;
took possession of the Moravian towns where they&#xD;
found large quantities of such provisions'as they&#xD;
stood in need of.&#xD;
Among-the trophies of this battle were six brass&#xD;
field pieces, surrendered by Hull, on two of which&#xD;
was the uotto-" surrendered by Burgoyne at Sara-&#xD;

The villages were found entirely desolated,. and&#xD;
so panic struck were some of the squaws that they&#xD;
threw their children into the river, to prevent them.&#xD;
froi being butchered by the Amerians. For the&#xD;
reason that the inhabitants of these towns had&#xD;
beerloet active, in conmitting depredations igon&#xD;
the frontier settlements, the soldiers reduced them&#xD;
to ashes before leaving them.&#xD;

A few days after this battle, Philip and his com-&#xD;
panions proceeded down the river Raisin, on their&#xD;
way to the cavern of Captain Pipe, where he&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXX.&#xD;
MEETTING WITH JOHNNY APPLESEED.&#xD;
"Thoy met again where Tolls the flood&#xD;
01 waters down Sandusky's shore."&#xD;
Immediately after the bloody battle of the Thames,&#xD;
our heroes returned to the cave of Captain Pipe,&#xD;
where they were joyfully received.by the old Indian&#xD;
and his daughter.&#xD;
The old man manifested much joy on hearing of&#xD;
the brilliant victories of the American army, and&#xD;
expressed it as his opinion that in the fall of the&#xD;
notorious Tecumseh, fell the hopes and expectations&#xD;
of the British arms in the west. And such was&#xD;
really the fact;&#xD;
On his return from the battle of the Thames,&#xD;
General Harrison was met at Detroit by a delega-&#xD;
tion of Indians, consisting of Ottawas, Chippewas.&#xD;
Pottawatamies, Miamies and Kickapoos, begging&#xD;
for a suspension of hostilities. They agreed to&#xD;
take up the same tomahawk with the Americans&#xD;
anid strike all who were or might be enemies of&#xD;
the United States, and in order to prove their sin-&#xD;

&#xD;
cerity they offered their women and' children as&#xD;
hostages.&#xD;
From this period till the final close of the *war,&#xD;
those Indians faithfully supported the American&#xD;
cause, with as much ardor and zeal as they. ad&#xD;
previously opposed it.&#xD;
The consternation which had spread over te&#xD;
west at the. commencement of the war, was now&#xD;
gradually subsiding.  Indian depradations    re&#xD;
less frequent, and the terror stricken-inhabitaints&#xD;
were seen leaving .the Forts. and Block  oue , in&#xD;
order to re-commence their farming operations.&#xD;
But while a partial peace was smiling=oivr }the&#xD;
North-West, the demon of :war,,was rollihg hi&#xD;
chariot of death ovgr other partsof the eoutntry,&#xD;
particularly along the Lake;and Sea coast.&#xD;
Our heroes, after -their return from the Thames,&#xD;
had made arrangements, for , joiningthe forces ut&#xD;
der Gen, Scott,,b  finding that, the arny had in-&#xD;
creased and that there w's -fo- lack, of soldiers,&#xD;
they changed their opinion, and; concluded to 'spend&#xD;
the winter with the Captain and 'his daughter.&#xD;
The cave of Captain Pipe, as already noticed was&#xD;
situated in a most delightful hunting country. It&#xD;
was krown to but few, and those hardly evrtisit.&#xD;
ed it, and .consequently, it was well calculated as a&#xD;
safe retreat from marauding bruds of tIdialts It&#xD;
was therefore agreed upon thatthis cave shouId be&#xD;
their' head quarters during  the winter, should&#xD;
they spend -i in the exciting pleasures of the&#xD;
chase.                  r  t    .,  a"&#xD;
Accordingly, in. a ferdays after 'their turn&#xD;
from  the war, they had made every arrangement&#xD;
necessary for the winter's hunting excursiom.&#xD;

whereupon he introduced Johnny to his friend,&#xD;
who had stood gazing in mute astonishment upon&#xD;
this odd specimen of human nature.&#xD;
After the joy and excitement produced by the&#xD;
appearance of Johnny had subsided, 'the friends&#xD;
gathered around the camp fire, when Johnny rela-&#xD;
.ted the history of his adventures since he had left&#xD;
his friends on the Black Fork.&#xD;
"Gentlemen," said Johnny, in commencing the&#xD;
narration of history, "1I am thankful to the Great&#xD;
Giver of ever good and perfect gift, that we have&#xD;
been spared to see each other's faces once more.&#xD;
But since we last met together, our lives have&#xD;
been crowded with sorrow and disappointment. We&#xD;
have been made to drink of the bitter cup of affig-&#xD;
tiori. You Mr. Seymour, have undergone oneof&#xD;

The news of this transaction produced a' high&#xD;
state of excitement among the whites. Spies were&#xD;
sent out in all directions to watch, the movements&#xD;
of the savages.&#xD;
On reaching the settlement, I found every cabin&#xD;
tenantless, and on calling at the Block House at&#xD;
Beam's Mill, I found that most of the families had&#xD;
taken refuge there  I made inquiry concerning&#xD;

the winter. On the return of Spring I visited my&#xD;
n series wpich lay scattered along the different'tri-&#xD;
butries of the Mohicain. Having bestowed upon&#xD;
thern the requisite attention, -[resolved to open up,&#xD;
or extend my sphere of usefulness. Accordingly&#xD;
I found my way to this region of Ohio, where I&#xD;
have hkeenfor several months past planting nurse'&#xD;
ries. As U lay in camp a few hundred yards up&#xD;
thi stream I saw the light of your camp-fire ; and&#xD;
wishiungto know who you were L came down the&#xD;
stream, under cover of darkness, and recognizing&#xD;
your voice, :entered your camp, taking you by&#xD;
surprise.',&#xD;
"Yes, aund by hokey," said Philip, " the surprise&#xD;
was'. ost complete."&#xD;
'Well,"mpid Johnny, "have you ever heard any-&#xD;
thing of our friend Captaig Pipe ?"&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
S&#xD;
j&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
"Heard from him ?" ejaculated Philip. "Cer-&#xD;
tainly-l left his residence but a few days ago!"&#xD;
"Ah ! indeed," said Johnny," "then he is in&#xD;
Cleveland yet."&#xD;
'"No, Mr. Chapman, not there. Let me think--1&#xD;
believe you have not heard of the deep affliition&#xD;
through which the old man was called to pass after&#xD;
his arrival in Cleveland."&#xD;
" No, sir," replied Johnny  "has any misfortune&#xD;
befallen him ?"&#xD;
"Yes, Mr. Chapman, replied Philip, and then re-&#xD;
lated to him the particulars of' Lilly's abduction,&#xD;
and her rescue from the garrison at Ft. "Malden.,&#xD;
"Poor child !" said Johnny, "I will see her 'im-&#xD;
mediately. I will visit her once more, and . ask&#xD;
the protection of the Great Spirit to be thrown&#xD;
around her."&#xD;
" Such a visit," replied Philip "would indeed, be&#xD;
most cheering to both the - Captain and Lilly.&#xD;
They often speak of you, and wonder where you&#xD;
are, and what' you are doing. They had almost&#xD;
come to the conclusion that you had been murder-&#xD;
ed by some of the sav:res."&#xD;
" Well," .said JoLnny, "we will lay down and&#xD;
take our rest, and in the morning we will return&#xD;
to the cave ; and thus ended the conversation for&#xD;
the present, and the little company lay down to&#xD;
seep.&#xD;
Morning came, but before the golden sun had lit&#xD;
up the dark forest, the company were on their way&#xD;
to the cavern, which they safely reached the next&#xD;
day about nightfall.&#xD;
On entering' it, the first object that met his gaze&#xD;
was his young disciple Lilly. Philip and his com-&#xD;
panions- had remained outside, until Johnny had&#xD;
surprised the Captain and his daughter, after which,&#xD;
and just in time to witness the manifestations of&#xD;
joy, they also entered.&#xD;
"Mr. Chapman !" exclaimed the young maiden,&#xD;

"God bless the dear child," replied Johnny, at&#xD;
the same time grasping her delicate hand in his.&#xD;
"God bless the dear child." repeated he, with tears&#xD;
in his eyes; and for a moment he stood gazing re-&#xD;
verently upon the lovely young creature.&#xD;
,Capt. Pipe, who was reclining upon his pallet of&#xD;
skins in another department, on hearing Lilly men-&#xD;
tion the name of Mr. Chapman, sprang to his feet&#xD;
and the next moment stood before his friend.&#xD;
"Mr. Chapman," exclaimed the Chieftain, "you&#xD;
are welcome here."&#xD;
"Captain," replied Johnny, "we meet at this&#xD;
time under singular circumstances. But the ways&#xD;
of Providence are truly wonderful, and in many&#xD;
instances, incomprehensible to us short sighted&#xD;
creatures. Since we last met, you indeed have met&#xD;
with much sorrow ; but I am rejoiced to know that&#xD;
you are now comforted.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXXI.&#xD;
CAPT. PIPES INTERVIEW WITH JOHNNY APPLESEED--DISCLOs&#xD;
URES RESPECTING LILLY'S ORIGIN-ITS EFFECTS UPON THE&#xD;
MIND OF ALFRED.&#xD;
But it is not necessary to tax the reader's patien-&#xD;
ce with a recital of the conversation which passed&#xD;
between the members of that happy circle on.that&#xD;
interesting occasion. Suffice it to say, that their&#xD;
conversation  related principally  to the happy&#xD;
scenes of other days.&#xD;
On the next morning Cap. Pipe and Johnny re-&#xD;
tired some distance from   the cave, and seating&#xD;
themselves upon the ,trunk of i fallen Iree, com-&#xD;
menced a low yet earnest conversation, "Mr. Chap.&#xD;
man," said the Captian," you are aware, I suppose,&#xD;
that Lilly and, Mr. Seyxnour, have formed an at-&#xD;
tachmnent for each other :-and I suppose from what&#xD;
Lilly has said.to me, will be married in a few days.&#xD;
Well I have taken this occasion to hold ' :private&#xD;
interview with you" respecting the origin of her,.&#xD;
whom most people suppose to be my real daughter&#xD;
Youtand Mr. Seymour have long since been aware&#xD;

&#xD;
that she is not my real daughter. Sir," continued&#xD;
the Chieftain, Lilly is, the real sister of the com-&#xD;
panion of Mr. Seymour, young Bradley?&#xD;
"Impossible !" exclaimed Johnny in much as-&#xD;
tonishment, "Impossible" continue he, looking full&#xD;
into. the Captains face, unable to give credence to&#xD;
his words-" By no means," replied the Captain,&#xD;
"it is even so, Lilly Pipe is none other than Anne&#xD;
Bradley, the sister of Alfred Bradley now in the&#xD;
cavern."&#xD;
"Captain," replied Johnny," I beg your pardon,&#xD;
for the insult offered you in discrediting your&#xD;
word, but you really astonish me: yet, in this I&#xD;
learn another lesson of God's goodness to his dear&#xD;
creatures-How strange are the ways of Providen-&#xD;
ce-At this moment Alfred is talking to her, whom&#xD;
he supposes to be now in the Spirit world. God in&#xD;
his goodness has brought them together, yet they&#xD;
know it not, and so saying Johnny relapsed into&#xD;
silence, overwhelmed by his feelings; and had the&#xD;
reader been standing by on this occasion, he would&#xD;
have seen tears of joy rolling down the sunburnt,&#xD;
and weather beaten cheeks of that tender hearted&#xD;
child of nature.&#xD;
1Mr. chapman," replied. the Chieftain-you&#xD;
weep--but your tears are those of joy. Listen and&#xD;
I will tell you now-"&#xD;
The next year after the treaty at Greenville&#xD;
(17,) a, party of whites landed at the mouth of&#xD;
Conneaut Creek about the middle of Summer,a&#xD;
lovelier place was nowhere to be. found. After re-&#xD;
maiing here for a while they left. A few families&#xD;
however; remained over minter there, did not be-&#xD;
long to the party which first landed,-but emigrated&#xD;
here in the fall. One of these was the family of&#xD;
Mr.1Bradley.&#xD;

appeared cheerful and happy, though in distitute&#xD;
circumstances. We remained with them oer night.&#xD;
The next morning we started home. On entering&#xD;
the woods about a half' mile from the cabins we&#xD;
came upon two white children who had, as usual&#xD;
wandered some distance up the stream to play.&#xD;
They had on this occasion, however, wandered far-&#xD;
ther way from their cabins than was usual-and&#xD;
had become bewildered. We rode up to them, and&#xD;
found that they were lost, we asked them if they&#xD;
wanted to go home; the elder replied, yes, I then.&#xD;
took up the smaller one on my horse while Black&#xD;
Hoof took the elder. Poor creatures, they sobbed&#xD;
and cried fit to break their little hearts, we pitied&#xD;
them, and were about turning back to take them&#xD;
to their homes, when Black Hoof' urged that we&#xD;
should carry them home with us and'adopt them in&#xD;
our families. The suggestion was agreed to, and&#xD;
we departed with our prisoners : and in due time&#xD;
arrived. at our villages-Black Hoof adopted his&#xD;
into his family, and I named mine Onishishska and&#xD;
adopted her into my family. She was afterwards&#xD;
called Lilly as you have heard, Lilly at the time of&#xD;
her capture was just beginning to talk, from which&#xD;
circumstances I judged she was About three Sum-&#xD;
mers old-her companion was some older, as was&#xD;
apparent from her size and speech.'&#xD;
After a few weeks Lilly became reconciled to&#xD;
her lot,, and grew cheerful and merry. She was&#xD;
handsome, and I loved' her because she was so&#xD;
playful and kind. As she grew older she became&#xD;
more attractive, and learned to love me with the&#xD;
fondness of a child. Igave heriall the iiistfuction&#xD;
in my power, as you have been informed&#xD;
And now, I deem it my 'duty to give her' up into&#xD;
the care of her lover end' brother, and attone in&#xD;
some measure for the wrong which I have done her&#xD;

and remained silent for a moinent. It was evident&#xD;
his feelims had overcome him, Johiny had sat&#xD;
silent and pensive, tears had coursed their way&#xD;
down his cheeks ; but commanding his feelings, he&#xD;
thus addressed the old Indian.-.&#xD;
"eCaptain Pipe, you seen deeply affected in re-&#xD;
conthin the past; but these scenes are over, and&#xD;
we live in the present. You did wrong in taking&#xD;
the child from'its home, but you have done right&#xD;
in bringing it up under good ,and wholesome . in-&#xD;

" But," ..enquired Johnny," had you not better&#xD;
see them all before you leave !"&#xD;
As you think best replied the Captain," and the&#xD;
two companions started for the cave, which after&#xD;
bidding the company a "good bye,' he left never&#xD;
to return again. The Captain's departure had&#xD;
been expected by Philip and Lilly: as =he had pre-&#xD;
viously spoken to them on this point; and, although&#xD;
they could not comprehend his reasons. for thus&#xD;
leaving them, yet they had no. idea that his depart-&#xD;
ure was a final one. On leaving them ,Philignoti&#xD;

she could not help smiling, though tears were stand-&#xD;

After Billy had spoken, the whole company as-&#xD;

"No, no," replied Lilly, much amused at Billy's&#xD;
expression-It is. not all mine-see here, there&#xD;
(handing him several gold coins and a couple of&#xD;
ornaments,) are yours."&#xD;
"Thank you-thank you," said Billy, and for&#xD;
your dithtinguithed kindneth, permit me to with&#xD;
you and Philip much happineth when the time&#xD;
cometh round to do tho."&#xD;
Ah ! Billy replied Philip, your dreaming again.&#xD;
"What! about thaketh," replied Billy.&#xD;
" Confound you and the snakes," cried Philip, I&#xD;
expect you'l haunt me through all eternity with&#xD;
the remembrance of those days of snake memory.&#xD;
On returning to the cave, Lilly divided the valu-&#xD;
ables equally among her companions, but Johnny&#xD;
refused taking any. Arrangements were next&#xD;
discused for paying one more visit to the home-&#xD;
steads upon the Black Fork. Accordingly. horses&#xD;
were procured and in a few days every thing was&#xD;
got in readiness for starting.&#xD;
It was towards the middle of October, one beau-&#xD;
tiful morning, when our heroes left the cave for&#xD;
the Black Fork. All were mounted upon horses,&#xD;
fiery and full of animation. Philip was appointed&#xD;
the leader or Captain. Before leaving the cave,&#xD;
the party bowed respectfully, to that subteranean&#xD;
refuge, and left in silence. It had been the home&#xD;
of one of the noblest spirits that roamed this for-&#xD;
' est, and it had been the refuge of one of the rarest&#xD;
flowers of the wilderness.&#xD;
It is needless to describe the incidents of their&#xD;
journey to the Black Fork. Of course it was attend'&#xD;
ded with that joy and' hilarity peculiar to all such&#xD;
excursions.&#xD;

Towards the close of the second day after leave-&#xD;
ing the cave, the company found themselves at the&#xD;
door of what once was the domicil of Capt. Pipe, and&#xD;
the home of the affectionate and tender hearted&#xD;
Lilly. There had she spent the days of her child-&#xD;
hood and the sight of her old homestead brought&#xD;
up in her mind the 'early associations of life. As&#xD;
the shades of night were setting in upon the forest&#xD;
it was agreed that the company should spend the&#xD;
evening in the cabin : accordingly the horses were&#xD;
made fast within an enclosure, and supplied with&#xD;
grass, of which there was an abundance around the&#xD;
house, and after preparing themselves with some&#xD;
refreshments, the little company seated themselves&#xD;
around the bflizing fire and entered into a conver-&#xD;
sation upon the scenes of the past. Each member&#xD;
of that interesting group had his own story to tell,&#xD;
but none was so touching as Lilly's.&#xD;
'She was now once more under the roof of her once&#xD;
happy cottage home, on the banks of her loved and&#xD;
romantic Black Fork.&#xD;
The poet when seeking a theme for his loftiest&#xD;
verse, will-turn with affection and pride to his early&#xD;
home, where first he felt the divine inspirations of&#xD;
poetic fire, where first he roamed the wild wood, or&#xD;
listened to the warbler's note, gleaning something&#xD;
around which he might weave with God-given pow-&#xD;
er, his glowing fancies.&#xD;
It matters not if the home be lowly, love and-&#xD;
poetry will find sweet music in the babbling rivu-&#xD;
let--affections within the cottage wall-every&#xD;
breeze that trembles, every flower that lifts its, cha-&#xD;
lice to the sun, and every bird that warbles its&#xD;
gladsome lay, brings to us reminescences of early&#xD;
home. The memories of home will find a cahn de-&#xD;
light in the hour of sun set, when the King of day&#xD;
is slowly sinking behind the western hills, and&#xD;
pouring his unclouded blaze of light on all surroun-&#xD;
ding objects-AAh, yes, and when the weary exile&#xD;

is riding far over the world of waters, along some&#xD;
distant shore, the beams of the sinking sun, rest-&#xD;
ing upon the hushed deep, or gilding the green&#xD;
billows and sending back to the eye, an increased&#xD;
radiance, will bring to mind the brightness and&#xD;
cherished glories of the home of his youth.&#xD;
Thoughts of our early home will crowd upon the&#xD;
mind wherever we may roam, and when after a&#xD;
lapse of years we revisit the sacred spot, what deep&#xD;
emotions fill our minds. Who that has visited the&#xD;
home of his youth has not felt that time, and dis-&#xD;
tance has lent enchantment to the spot.&#xD;
Such, were the reflections that passed through&#xD;
the mind of Lilly, as she sat gazing upon the va-&#xD;
cant wall of that forest cot, once the home of her&#xD;
youth.&#xD;
There, and within this rude enclosure had she&#xD;
often sat upon the knee, and by the side of him,&#xD;
whom she called father, and listened to his simple&#xD;
tales of Indian life-here too, she had often ming-&#xD;
led in the company of her dark eyed forest com-&#xD;
panions, had rambled.- thl them along the grassy&#xD;
and flower decked banks of the rippling stream-&#xD;
here, and under the cool shade of the forest, she&#xD;
had often and often listened to the music of the&#xD;
feathered songsters ; here, and upon this grassy&#xD;
lawn, she had time, and time again, gazed upon&#xD;
the sinking sun, until his last, golden rays rese&#xD;
high along the distant hills, and left the shades of&#xD;
night to follow in their wake--There too had she&#xD;
sat in other days, looking up in the dark dome&#xD;
of heaven, and watching as she supposed the&#xD;
Great Spirit lighting up the heavens, with his cel-&#xD;
estial fires, manifested in the appearance, one&#xD;
after another of the brilliant stars.&#xD;
Lilly was a child of nature, which in all its depths&#xD;
was replete with music to her soul-She saw a&#xD;
beauty and heard a music in the stillness of the&#xD;
twilight hour, and in the voice -of the balmy&#xD;

breeze, as it sighs amid the stirring leaves of the&#xD;
starlit grove, or reposing upon the unruffled bosom&#xD;
of the placid waters-She had heard and realized&#xD;
that there was music in the glad songsters of the&#xD;
grove ; and felt that there was the voice of the&#xD;
Great Spirit in the mutterings of the pealing thun-&#xD;
ders above -or on earth-in the out spread skies&#xD;
and in the invisible air-in the solitary dell, or&#xD;
upon the gentle hilltop-in the ever changing glo-&#xD;
ries of the footstool of the Almighty, or among the&#xD;
ever burning celesteai lights, which gem the high&#xD;
firmament, and light the angels to their evening&#xD;
orisins, in all, through all, and over all, as though&#xD;
from ten thousand times ten thousand harps, she&#xD;
heard the sweetest melody, pouring from earth, air&#xD;
and the heavens; all conspiring to make her forest&#xD;
home the abode of happiness. in short, may we&#xD;
not add that in those palmy days this music was&#xD;
the atmosphere of heaven to her innocent spirit,&#xD;
and that she looked upon the green crested earth&#xD;
and the star spangled heavens, as the lyre of the&#xD;
Great Spirit, whose strings were touched by him&#xD;
alone; sending out strains of Divinest melody.&#xD;
Thus sat Lilly for some moments, in a kind of&#xD;
dreamy listlessness, while thoughts of other days&#xD;
were passing through her mind. She looked a-&#xD;
round. for her father, but he was not there, his&#xD;
voice was not heard among the voices there. How&#xD;
changed, even the old cabin seemed to mourn his&#xD;
absence. Months and years had passed since her&#xD;
first recollections of this sacred cot, and now for&#xD;
aught she knew, she had taken refuge in it for the&#xD;
last time. Tears filled her eyes, and rising from&#xD;
her seat she made her way to the grove, a few&#xD;
steps in the rear of the cabin, where in other days&#xD;
she had often sat musing upon the beauties of the&#xD;
glowing landscape around. The sun was just hiding&#xD;
his golden face behind the tree tops, and his glow-&#xD;

&#xD;
ing beams came streaming through the forest trees,&#xD;
in long lines of golden light -&#xD;
The sight of a setting sun is glorious at all times,&#xD;
but to Lilly, on this occasion, it was a melancholy&#xD;
sight. How often in other days had she beheld that&#xD;
same sun setting, in cloudless glory behind the&#xD;
same forest trees, had heard the same hum of noct-&#xD;
urnal insect choristers, chiming their evening lays&#xD;
to Luna, the bright queen of the stilly night, and&#xD;
with what joyous emotions, and kind good feelings,&#xD;
had she sat in this same shady bower conversing&#xD;
with her red faced companions, of coming life and&#xD;
future prospects.&#xD;
There flowed the same beautiful stream, here&#xD;
stood the-same forest, now clothed in garments of&#xD;
mourning, as the chilling frosts of autumn, cold win-&#xD;
ters precursor, were beating heavily upon it, here&#xD;
stood the same cottage, around which were grow-&#xD;
ing the same plants and wild flowers, which, in&#xD;
other days she had woven into boquets for some&#xD;
loved one.&#xD;
Musing upon the past, she thus sat, for some time,&#xD;
until aroused by the voice of Alfred calling her to&#xD;
the cabin.&#xD;
Returning to the cabin she found the company&#xD;
preparing to retire to rest.&#xD;
Lilly lay down upon her pallet of skins, but could&#xD;
not close her eyes in sleep. Visions of the past&#xD;
haunted her mind-Long, long days had passed&#xD;
away since last she had closed her eyes in sleep in&#xD;
this lone cottage; here she was once more, under&#xD;
the same roof, which had sheltered her in her in-&#xD;
fancy from many a rude tempestuous wintry storm,&#xD;
but the heart in whose affections she had lived for&#xD;
years, was not with her, it was the first night she&#xD;
had ever spent in that cabin without him; and this&#xD;
though seemed to rend her young heart assunder.&#xD;
She wept bitterly, and in weeping found relief-.&#xD;
Hours thus passed until overcome, she fell asleep,&#xD;
&#xD;
from which she did not awaken until aroused by&#xD;
the voice of her brother calling her to their morn-&#xD;
ing meal.&#xD;
Lilly arose, more cheerful than when she lay&#xD;
down on the preceeding evening, and after saluting&#xD;
her companions, begged them to excuse her drowsi-&#xD;
ness. She expressed herself much refreshed, and&#xD;
commenced preparations for the day's journey.&#xD;
Towards the middle of the day, the party (which&#xD;
had left the cabin about 9 o'clock that morning,)&#xD;
arrived in front of the door of the Seymour cabin.&#xD;
Philip's mind was deeply affected on once more&#xD;
gazing upon his former home, and the scenes of&#xD;
the past were called afresh into his memory.&#xD;
Having secured their horses in the stable, the&#xD;
whole company entered the cabin. Like the form-&#xD;
er its walls were vacant, and silent-Once the&#xD;
abode ofjoy and happiness, now silent and tenant-&#xD;
less. A deep solemnity rested upon the minds of'&#xD;
that little company, and for some moments not a&#xD;
word was spoken. At length, Philip, who had been&#xD;
gazing upon the naked walls for some moments, in&#xD;
deep and solemn reflection broke the silence.&#xD;
" Friends," said he. and his bos m heaved with&#xD;
deep emotion-" I sand once more upon this blood&#xD;
stained floor. I look around me, but I see not&#xD;
those with whom  I associated in early life--This&#xD;
rude domicil once contained two as cheerful and&#xD;
happy hearts as ever sent the red current of life&#xD;
through the veins of living mortals ; but, alas one&#xD;
of these is no more. Under. yonders shady tree,&#xD;
on the banks of that murmuring stream, repose&#xD;
her last remains-the other now mourns her sad&#xD;
and untimely fate."&#xD;
"Ah !" replied Johnny, such is. human life.--Like&#xD;
the flower, it fades and dies.-All thats mortal&#xD;
must decay-nothing is real here, all is fitfull, fleet-&#xD;
ing changing, and passing away. Dangers stand&#xD;
Vhick around us, and sometimes when least expect-&#xD;

ed, mortals are cut down in a moment. But here,&#xD;
(taking a Testament from his bosom) here is the&#xD;
hope of our Salvation and immortality-In this&#xD;
blessed volume we are told the righteous shall&#xD;
live forever-then, Mr. Seymour, why mourn her&#xD;
exit from earth-She lives in a holier and happier&#xD;
clime. I have seen the righteous die ; but I have&#xD;
never seen an end to the mercy of the Redeemer-&#xD;
it fades not, neither does it die. Tis true we are&#xD;
under the influence of natural affection, and this&#xD;
often times leads us to mourn when we should re-&#xD;
joice."&#xD;
"Tis all true, Mr. Chapman," replied Philip, I&#xD;
am aware that we must all soon pass into another&#xD;
state of existence ; yet fond recollection lingers&#xD;
arround the sacred Spot where love reposes. To&#xD;
those who never knew a sister's love, and have&#xD;
never wept over a sister's grave, such feelings as I&#xD;
now possess, they have never realized. True the&#xD;
Poet has said.&#xD;
When memory fondly lingers near&#xD;
The silent grave where love reposes&#xD;
And sheds with burning eye the tear,&#xD;
On the pale wreath of withered roses&#xD;
Some Seraph formin brightness clad,&#xD;
Comes to dispell the gloom of sorrow&#xD;
Bids the lone mourners heart be glad,&#xD;
And whispers "She will wake tomorrow."&#xD;
"Yes," replied Johnny, although I am not much&#xD;
inclined to favor poetical quotations in religious&#xD;
affairs, yet I must acknowledge this a true speci..&#xD;
men of poetic truth-" She will wake tomorrow-&#xD;
cheering thought."&#xD;
There the conversation ended, and the whole&#xD;
company bent their steps to the graves of their pa-&#xD;
rent and sister of Philip, and also that of the gal-&#xD;
lent Ruffner.&#xD;
There said Philip, pointing to the graves of his&#xD;
sires, lay the remains of my unfortunate parents.&#xD;
"Peace to their ashes, and rest to their Souls,"&#xD;
responded Johnny,&#xD;
" And here," said Philip, lie the remains of poor&#xD;
&#xD;
Kate"-and bending over her grave tears fell fast&#xD;
from his eyes upon the cold sod, that covered her&#xD;
from his sight. By his side stood the beautiful&#xD;
Lilly, hanging upon the arm of her brother, ming-&#xD;
ling their tears with those of Philip.&#xD;
And- there said Philip, pointing to the remaining&#xD;
grave, lies the mangled body of the heroic Ruffner,&#xD;
who fell cut to pieces defending the bodies of those&#xD;
alongside of whom he now sleeps."&#xD;
Billy on seeing the grave of his master, threw&#xD;
his body down upon it, and for a moment wept in&#xD;
silence-he loved him, for Ruffner, had been more&#xD;
like a father to him, than a master.&#xD;
"Ah," said Billy, while tears fell fast from his&#xD;
eyes, thith ith my mathterth latht rethting place.&#xD;
I almotht with I wath lying by hith thide--and so&#xD;
saving he sobbed alcud-Biliy, had passed through&#xD;
dangers by night and by day, and by land and by&#xD;
water-he had seen death strew the earth around&#xD;
him, but never before was he so deeply moved.&#xD;
Come, come, Billy said Alfred dry up those tears,&#xD;
your master sleeps in peace---he has fought his last&#xD;
battle, in defence of the helpless and innocent, and&#xD;
future generations will mark the sacred spot where&#xD;
the gallant dutchman fell-a monument will yet be&#xD;
erected to his memory, and future generations will&#xD;
visit his grave, and read the history of his untimely&#xD;
fate."&#xD;
After remaining some time at the graves of his&#xD;
friends, Philip and his companions, returned to the&#xD;
cabin, where they spent the night. It was the last&#xD;
night that ever that company spent together on&#xD;
the Black Fork.&#xD;
During the remainder of the day, arrangements&#xD;
had been made for visiting their friends in Penn-&#xD;
sylvania. A pressing invitations was extented to&#xD;
Johnny and Billy to accompany them. But they&#xD;
refused, Johnny alleged that it was his duty to re-&#xD;
main in the wilderness, until his mission was ended,&#xD;

&#xD;
and Billy expressed a deep anxiety to accompany&#xD;
Johnny, out west, at least as far as to Wappukonoetta&#xD;
viliage.  It was therefore settled that the next&#xD;
morning Philip and Alfred and his sister, would&#xD;
start for Pennsylvaina, and Johnny and Billy would&#xD;
return to the west--Night passed away and morn-&#xD;
ing dawned.&#xD;
As soon as the light of day, had broke over the&#xD;
forest, the company were astir making prepara-&#xD;
tions for the journey. The hour of separation&#xD;
come ; and the scene which followed, we cannot&#xD;
describe-old and tried friends were now to part-&#xD;
part,,in all probability, to meet no more.&#xD;
"Billy," said Philip, as he grasped him by the&#xD;
hand, "it is hard to part with you--gou, who to&#xD;
Mr. Bradley and myself, have been the master of&#xD;
our sports and pleasant hours. In parting with&#xD;
you Icannot but express a wish that your true and&#xD;
generous heart never fall a prey to the tempter's&#xD;
snare."&#xD;
"Amen," replied Johnny who stood listening to&#xD;
Philip's admontion with eyes sparkling with kind&#xD;
go od feeling -" Amen," repeated he, Mr. Seymour&#xD;
I feel that you speak the words of truth and So-&#xD;
berness." Having shaken hands with all, Billy&#xD;
advanced to where Lilly was standing, and taking&#xD;
her by her soft atid delicate hand, said in a most&#xD;
manly and dignified tone of voice-&#xD;
"MithuttLilly I motht heartly congratulate you&#xD;
on the accession of 'a new brother, and with two&#xD;
thuch brave hearth ath hith and Philip'th, you are&#xD;
thave even in a den of all the thnakes in the uni-&#xD;
verth, and with thith knowledge I can then more&#xD;
readily withdraw my protective arms from yer"&#xD;
"Bravo, bravo," shouted Philip and Alfred with&#xD;
one voice, while tears fell from their eyes.&#xD;
Long live Bunty Billy, the-" Hero of Wappa-&#xD;
konetta," cried Lilly, her full heart overflowing&#xD;
with gratitude to the young backwoodsman. But&#xD;
&#xD;
ere the echo of these voices had died away, the&#xD;
parties had separated, one on their way to the east,&#xD;
the other to mingle among the wild scenes of the&#xD;
wilderness.&#xD;
-CONCLUSION.&#xD;
Years had passed away since the party above&#xD;
described ,had parted on the banks of the Black&#xD;
Fork. Each having looked upon the other for the&#xD;
last time.&#xD;
Towards the close of a beautiful Summer evening&#xD;
in the year 1847, a stranger, stricken with years,&#xD;
and in tattered garments, made his appearance at&#xD;
the door of a beautiful little cottage which stood on&#xD;
the banks of a small stream which runs through&#xD;
one of the many romantic vallies of the west.&#xD;
On knocking at the door the stranger was bid to&#xD;
enter, and being shown a chair sat down, placing&#xD;
his little budget by his side.&#xD;
"A very beautiful evening sir," said the.stran-&#xD;
ger to the proprietor of the house, a rather goode&#xD;
looking middle-aged gentleman.&#xD;
Yes, replied the host, nature is always beautiful-&#xD;
but you seem weary, have you travelled far to&#xD;
day?&#xD;
About twenty miles, as near as I can judge, re-&#xD;
plied the stranger.&#xD;
A very remarkable walk sir, for one of your age,&#xD;
replied the man of the house-but I suppose you&#xD;
are used to this exercise.&#xD;
"Friend," replied the stranger, I am as you per-&#xD;
ceive well stricken in'years,I have seen full seventy&#xD;
winters, and will see no more-my mission on earth&#xD;
is completed, and I shall soon be gathered to the&#xD;
habitation of my fathers. As you have supposed&#xD;
I have been upon. my feet all my life, and have&#xD;
been a sojourner in the wilderness, since called&#xD;
upon my mission."&#xD;

"I presume then, replied the host you are a mis-&#xD;
sionary or Minister of the Gospel."&#xD;
Yes sir, meekly replied the old man, while his&#xD;
dim and sunken eyes, were filled with tears-I have&#xD;
taught what I conceived to be the true doctrines&#xD;
of the Bible, and expect shortly to eat the fruits&#xD;
of my doings in a better land.&#xD;
The manner in which the old man had spoken&#xD;
these words, was deeply affecting, bringing tears to&#xD;
the eyes of his hearer, who wishing to know more&#xD;
of the singular stranger with whom he was conver-&#xD;
sing, thus addressed him.&#xD;
Sir it would give me much pleasure, and I have&#xD;
no doubt much interest to know your history, which&#xD;
I am satisfied is a most interesting one.&#xD;
"Then," said the stranger, I will comply with&#xD;
your request. I was born far away towards the&#xD;
rising sun, upon the banks of oie of the most ro-&#xD;
mantic streams which washes the shores of New&#xD;
England. In early life I imbibed a fondness for&#xD;
rural scenery, and often wandered from my home'&#xD;
along the banks of the stream in quest of natural&#xD;
curiosities, flowers and plants, Nothing gave me&#xD;
more pleasure than listening to the music of birds,&#xD;
and the hum of insects. I had thus grown up to&#xD;
boyhood, conversing withlthe various objects of na-&#xD;
ture around me ; I had received a limited educa-&#xD;
tion, I had been taught the common branches of&#xD;
education. One day while in the deep forest med-&#xD;
itating upon the goodness of God, as exemplified&#xD;
in creation (for I had received a pious education) I&#xD;
heard, as I supposed a voice immediately behind&#xD;
me, saying,-&#xD;
"Arise run ye to and fro through the wilderness.&#xD;
and bear the words of life to the heathen thereof''&#xD;
I cast my eyes to where the sound proceeded,&#xD;
but saw no living being. At first I was somewhat&#xD;
astonished and no little alarmed. But then I re-&#xD;
collected that a similar voice had spoken to the&#xD;
&#xD;
291&#xD;
&#xD;
prophet Samuel, and I concluded that it was the&#xD;
voice of an angel, commissioning me to proclaim&#xD;
the glad tidings of peace. Returning 'to my home,&#xD;
I sought an interview with my parents and com-&#xD;
municated to them my call to the ministry, as a&#xD;
missionary, and expressed my , determination to&#xD;
obey the summons.&#xD;
I was about 18 years of age when I left the home&#xD;
of my youth, for the perils of the wilderness. I&#xD;
bent my steps to western Pennsylvania, where I&#xD;
remained for some years, until it became settled&#xD;
with white inhabitants ; from thence 'I made my&#xD;
way into the Ohio forests, where I remained for some&#xD;
years after the war 6f 1812, preaching and teach-&#xD;
ing, and otherwise trying to benefit my fellows ;&#xD;
Finding that my sphere of usefulness was diminish-&#xD;
ing in Ohio, I left it a few years ago, and have&#xD;
made my way into this region, where j shall lay&#xD;
my wearied limbs forever at rest."&#xD;
Your's indeed is a singular history, replied the&#xD;
settler, but have you never been at home since&#xD;
you left ?"&#xD;
"Home," replied the old man while tears rolled&#xD;
down his furrowed cheeks-" home," repeated he,&#xD;
and his eyes shone with a lustre of divinity-I&#xD;
have no home on earth. My home is over yonder,&#xD;
and he raised his trembling hand, and pointed to-&#xD;
wards the skies. But, continued he, there were&#xD;
sunny spots in childhood's palmy days--and well do&#xD;
I 'remember, the endearing affections of the home&#xD;
of my youth-the fond smiles of a tenderhearted&#xD;
mother, and the sweet kisses of an affectionate sis-&#xD;
ter--all these endearing associations, I relinquish-&#xD;
ed forever, and made the wild. wide forest, my&#xD;
earthly habitation, and its wild beasts and wild&#xD;
men my companions-the flower strewn earth, for&#xD;
the past 40 years has been my only bed, and the&#xD;
leafy grove or star spangled heavens my only shel-&#xD;

and of privations-yet I have been happy-.-&#xD;
You may.imagine that there is no happiness out&#xD;
side of the home circle-but [can assure you sir,&#xD;
that in holding converse with -Nature's God&#xD;
through the medium of his works, one realizes a&#xD;
happiness never dreamed of in the home circle.&#xD;
Go sir," as I have gone, alone, all alone amid the&#xD;

murmuring stream, or the placid lake, and there&#xD;
let the heart meditate-and you will feel and ex-&#xD;
perience the highest sense of enjoyment. In -ro&#xD;

can gaze upon the deep blue sky, boundless in ex-&#xD;

home of the blest-and in all of this you will feel a&#xD;
joy and happiness which are not found in the halls&#xD;
of fashionable life.&#xD;
Strange and mysterious being, who art thou?&#xD;
asked the deeply interested settler, who had lis-&#xD;
tened''to the deeply touching pathos of the old&#xD;
man, as he spoke of his wanderings through the&#xD;
forest.&#xD;
I am a lone pilgrim, replied the old man, my&#xD;
name is written in the Lamb's book of life, and read&#xD;
there by all the hosts of heaven- I am journeying&#xD;
to a country unseen by mortal eyes, where I shall&#xD;
live and live forevermore.&#xD;
But, I would know thy name, that I'might remem-&#xD;
her thee, in after days, replied the settler.&#xD;
My name responded the old man is Jonathan&#xD;
Chapman; I am more familiarly known among the&#xD;
people of western Pennsylvania, and northwestern&#xD;
Ohio, as Johnny Appleseed.&#xD;
"What !" exclaimed the settler ia much aston-&#xD;
&#xD;
ishment, " Johnny Appleseed of Richland County,&#xD;
notoriety ?"&#xD;
The same replied Johnny, and casting his search-&#xD;
ing eyes full into the face of the settler, asked him&#xD;
if ever he had resided. there.&#xD;
That replied the settler was my my home in 1811.&#xD;
I was then a small boy, I recollect of seeing you&#xD;
but I suppose you do not recollect me, On the&#xD;
breaking out of the war, my father removed to&#xD;
Cleveland, where we remained till the close of the&#xD;
war, when we moved to this region.&#xD;
"Well,"replied the old man, since you have seen&#xD;
me in the prime of life, and as you now find me on&#xD;
the verge of death, let me ask but one favor -of&#xD;
you, in the name of him, in whose cause I have&#xD;
lived and will shortly die.&#xD;
Name it replied the generous settler-, name it&#xD;
and your request shall be gratified.&#xD;
I would ask the privilege of your house in which&#xD;
to end my days, which you.may rest assured are but&#xD;
few, for I feel that death is even now destroying&#xD;
this earthly tabernacle of mine.&#xD;
The cabin of my father, in other days, replied&#xD;
the kind hearted settler, was always open to sup-&#xD;
ply the wants of the destitute stranger; .and his&#xD;
generous example shall be followed by his. son-&#xD;
therefore, venerable old man, consider my house&#xD;
your home."&#xD;
Thank you, thank you, replied the old. pilgrim,&#xD;
while tears fell fast and thick from his fine black&#xD;
eyes.&#xD;
The sun had already gone down, and: the shades&#xD;
of night were setting in-the old man had walked&#xD;
several miles during the day and was much fatigu-&#xD;
ed-He begged =his host for a bowl of milk and a&#xD;
piece of bread, at this moment the settler's wife, a&#xD;
fine portly good looking lady opened the door and&#xD;
announced supper waiting.&#xD;
You'l please step out to supper said the settler,&#xD;

&#xD;
but the old man begged to eat by himself. His re-&#xD;
quest was granted, after which they retired to bed,&#xD;
the old man persistingin sleeping upon the floor. Be-&#xD;
fore retiring he asked permission to hold a spirit-&#xD;
ual communion with the family, and taking from&#xD;
his little budget, the work of life he opened and&#xD;
read.&#xD;
Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the&#xD;
kingdom of Heaven-Blessed are they that mourn&#xD;
for they shall be comforted--Blessed are the meek&#xD;
for they shall inherit the earth-Blessed are they&#xD;
which do hunger and thirst after righteouness; .for&#xD;
they shall be filled-Blessed are the merciful, for&#xD;
they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in&#xD;
heart for they shall see God,-then closing the&#xD;
book he invoked the blessings of heaven upon the&#xD;
family, and lay down to rest.&#xD;
Morning came. A bright and glorious sun rose&#xD;
unclouded. A holy calm was spread over the land-&#xD;
scape, while the forest echoed with the music of&#xD;
the many feathered songsters which filled the&#xD;
grove. But there was one within the walls of that&#xD;
humble little cottage that saw not that rising sun&#xD;
nor heard that soul in-spiring music, for on enter-&#xD;
in g the room where the lonely stranger lay, it was&#xD;
discovered that he had indeed gone to rest. He&#xD;
was dead, he had died without a struggle, and up-&#xD;
on his pale and bloodless lips rested the smile of&#xD;
joy with which he died-Perhaps he had been con-&#xD;
versing with his loved ones, who soothed and com-&#xD;
forted his weary spirit in his dying moments.&#xD;
Thus died Johnny Appleseed, who had lived a&#xD;
moral blameless life, and had wandered like a de-&#xD;
serted pilgrim through the dreary wilderness, a&#xD;
stranger among strangers.&#xD;
His remains are now lying near Fort Wayne,&#xD;
Allen Co. Indiana.&#xD;
The balance of our story is soon told. Philip&#xD;
Seymour was united, in marriage with Anne Bradi-&#xD;
&#xD;
r&#xD;
&#xD;
ley, the supposed daughter of Captain Pipe of&#xD;
Richland Co. and after paying his friends a visit in&#xD;
Pennsylvania, settled down on a beautiful location&#xD;
in one of the southwestern States. Alfred Bradley&#xD;
accompanied Philip and his sister to their new&#xD;
home in Texan, and was killed in the battle of San&#xD;
Jacinto, while fighting for the liberties of Texas,&#xD;
in 1836.&#xD;
.Bunty Billy, a few y1Aars after leaving Richland&#xD;
Co., married the young Squaw, with whom. he had&#xD;
the rough and tumbl4(scuffle on the villagegreen ;&#xD;
and shortly afterwarIs emigrated farther westward.&#xD;
Captain Pipe died af a good old agegarpopg, his red&#xD;
brethern in the far vest, in the Indian Reservation.&#xD;
And thus ends /our. truthful narration. :Long&#xD;
years have passed/way since the scenes described&#xD;
herein have been enacted. Yet there are 'ti'll mna-&#xD;
ny living witnesses n this country who willibear tee-&#xD;
timony to the mo     important facts conined&#xD;
herein. But after all, an  for want okygIeldge&#xD;
will feel disposed to call the whole  (niiquestion,&#xD;
and treat the whole as a work of flvionrtat. pro-&#xD;
duction of inagination&#xD;
Others again will find no objections to thetryth&#xD;
of the matter, but to the manierof      ion.&#xD;
In many instances words of rather doubtfu-&#xD;
ty are used.. To this we answer.-A faithful hi o r-&#xD;
ian must use such language as wiconvey ha nest&#xD;

many instances, however, wehavetandthis&#xD;

The work is not free fromiimperfections ; but as&#xD;
is we throw it before the public for their accept-&#xD;
auce or refusal. If it has merits it will be appre-&#xD;
ciated, if it be destitute of them, it should be con-&#xD;
signed with all worthless trash to everlasting con-&#xD;
