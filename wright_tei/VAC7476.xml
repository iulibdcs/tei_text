GLEASON'S PICTORIAL&#xD;
&amp;amp; WiIUG-100M COMPAIOfl,&#xD;
A RECORD OF THE BEAUTIFUL AND USEFUL IM ART.&#xD;
The object of this paper is to present, in the most elegant and available form, a weekly lite&#xD;
melange of notable events of the day. Its columns are devoted to original tales, sketches&#xD;
poems, by the&#xD;
BEST AMERICAN AUTHORS,&#xD;
and the cream of the domestic and foreign news; the whole well spiced with wit and humor.&#xD;
Each paper is&#xD;
BBAUTIFULLYt ILLUSTRATE&#xD;
with numerous accurate engravings, by eminent artists, of notable objects, current events in all&#xD;
parts Of the world, and of men and manners, altogether making a paper entirely original in its&#xD;
design in this country. Its pages contain views of every populous city in the known world, of&#xD;
all buildings of note in the eastern or western hemisphere, of all the principal ships and steamers&#xD;
of the navy and merchant service, with fine portraits of every noted character in the world, male&#xD;
and female.  Sketches of beautiful scenery, taken from life, are also given, with numerous&#xD;
specimens from the animal kingdom, the birds of the air, and the fish of the sea. The Compan-&#xD;
ion is now printed on the finest of satin-surface paper, from a font of new and beautiful type,&#xD;
manufactured expressly for it,-presenting in its mechanical execution an elegant specimen of art.&#xD;
It contains fifteen hundred and sixty-four square inches, giving a great amount of reading matter&#xD;
and illustrations-a mammoth weekly paper of sixteen octave pages. It forms&#xD;
inasmuch as its aim is constantly, in connection with the fund of amusement it affords, and the&#xD;
rich array of original miscellany it presents, to inculcate the strictest and highest tone of morality,&#xD;
and to encourage virtue by holding up to view all that is good and pure, and avoiding all that is&#xD;
evil in its tendency. In short, the object is to make the paper loved, respected, and sought after&#xD;
for its. combined excellences.&#xD;

castle and at her gangways, while her ensign,&#xD;
blowing sluggishly out from the end of her gaff,&#xD;
displayed the double-headed eagle of Russia.&#xD;
A long and tortuous course had that frigate's&#xD;
sailing-master marked upon the chart, day b6y&#xD;
day, since she had left the imperial dockyard at&#xD;
Cronstadt, bound for Smyrna. After ploughing&#xD;
the stormy Gulf of Finland, and threading the&#xD;
mazes of the Cattegat Straits, her crew had first&#xD;
caught a passing glimpse of the chalky cliffs of&#xD;
England, and had then seen the verdant head-&#xD;
lands of France. Tempest-tossed in the Bay of&#xD;
Biscay, the gallant frigate next exchanged a&#xD;
gladsome salute with the embattled rock of Gib-&#xD;
raltar, and then traversed the sapphire waves of&#xD;
the     '               " sea oc m   ories.".&#xD;

were conversing in groups, and pointing with,&#xD;
eager gestures towards the shore; and those on&#xD;
the quarter-deck, clothed in authority, were&#xD;
scarcely less exhilarated by the glowing;s.ee&#xD;
One, in particular, who wore an undre.isarmy&#xD;

Of the early life of Alexis we can say but lit-&#xD;
tle, for even his own recollections were vague&#xD;
and confused. He had an indistinct remembrance&#xD;
of a lady who used to .kiss him ere he went to.&#xD;
sleep at night, and to greet him with a kiss in&#xD;
the morning; but where it was, or who she was,&#xD;
he could not say. The positive horizon of his&#xD;
memory was bounded by his residence with his&#xD;
grandfather,-the Russian Consul at Smyrna,-&#xD;
where he was humored by Katina, the house-&#xD;
keeper, and taught, to ride by Demetri, her hus-&#xD;
band, who was the factotum of the 'consulate.&#xD;
From Smyrna, he was taken to the Polytechnic&#xD;
School, at St. Petersburg, where he soon became&#xD;
a favorite with instructors and pupils. Excel-&#xD;
.leint   were sent to his randfather, who&#xD;
V4iterest it         ss, and&#xD;
*s .vq 'to                    final ex--&#xD;
niination.    exs tok the   g     onor, and&#xD;
consequently received a commission in the Im-&#xD;
perial Guard. What a distinctionI The consul&#xD;
remained to witness the young comet's first ap-&#xD;
pearance on parade with his regiment, in the&#xD;
"agser Platz," and his eyes sparkled with joy&#xD;
A§ the- emperor complimented the young recruit.&#xD;
Ere the old gentleman returned to Smyrna,.he&#xD;
edged a large sum of money with the army&#xD;
bankersto'thegordet of Conet Orloff; and noth-&#xD;
Iti balanced intellect could have kept&#xD;

with unsteady ses, to thelarge projecting win-&#xD;

Now a carayan of heavily-laden camels would&#xD;
&#xD;
pass, patieitly following, in regular file, peering&#xD;
with their long necks into second story windows.&#xD;
Then, to the music of a discordant drum, wopld&#xD;
come a relief guard of 'urkish soldiers, miser-&#xD;
ably at ease' in their -uropean uniforms. ;Loud&#xD;
cries from a Nubian driver would clear the way&#xD;
for an " araba,"-a clumsy conveyance drawn&#xD;
by a yoke of sleek oxen,-containing the lady-&#xD;
birds of some "harem," let out for an airing ; or&#xD;
more vigorous shouts would part the tide of bu-&#xD;
manity to let pass a gang of sturdy porters,&#xD;
staggering under poles to which was hung their&#xD;
burthens. Among these prominent objects; lil e&#xD;
the fine tracery in a gorgeous Persian Shawl,,&#xD;
were individuals equally"remarkable in their ap-&#xD;
pearance. Sone w~ro the gay garb of Albania;&#xD;

not, unusual to, see smooth-aved Parisipos in tho&#xD;

with European fashions.&#xD;

THE RUSSIAN GUARDSMAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
19&#xD;
&#xD;
bay-its silver tide studded with vessels quietly&#xD;
riding at their anchors; their masts, and spars,&#xD;
and tracery of rigging clearly defined against&#xD;
the clear sunlit sky, while the flags of various&#xD;
nations fluttered from their mast-heads. Thread-&#xD;
ing their way among the anchored fleet were the&#xD;
market-boats, with large wing-likesails and gilded&#xD;
sterns; while, towering above all, was the dark&#xD;
hull of the " Nicolai."  On either side of the&#xD;
harbor were beautiful "kiosks,"-or country-&#xD;
houses,-surrounded by gardens over which na-&#xD;
ture had thrown a rich garland of flowers.. And&#xD;
far in the background, dotting the bleeding of&#xD;
sky and water, rose craggy islands, shadowed&#xD;
with thick wood.&#xD;
The consul passed a great portion of his time&#xD;
with the convalescent, pointing out the various&#xD;
objects of interest visible from the windows, and&#xD;
questioning him about his campaigns. It  d,&#xD;
it seemed that the old gentleman would never&#xD;
weary of hearing about THr battle, or of the&#xD;
memorable passage of the river which so inter-&#xD;
ested the Grand Duke Nicholas. Singularly,&#xD;
though,-at least, Alexis thoughtsoA-he eevq&#xD;
alluded to the more distant past. In vain did&#xD;
the young man occasionally endeavor to lead&#xD;
thi convrsaiori bac it  the ' ayb of his ebid-&#xD;
hogdiewith a hope of elicmting suoie information,&#xD;
abo'ia his arentss. "hie consul had, evidently,&#xD;
a lirrjr of die subj6-so much so that one day&#xD;
wgen Aleis inqiired:&#xD;
Grandfdier, was m  fatheriat afl mii tary in&#xD;

-The old gentleman arose and replied in astern&#xD;
tone of voice:&#xD;
"You should have sense endth, Major Or-&#xD;

but, ere the sentence was fairly begun the consul&#xD;

As Alexis recovered, he became acquainted&#xD;
with the various subordinates in his grandfather's&#xD;
employ; all of whom, with one exception, ap-&#xD;
peared to take great -interest in explaining the&#xD;
various departments under their especial charge.&#xD;
But Monsieur Lavalette, head book-keeper and&#xD;
cashier, evidently regarded the major as an in-&#xD;
truder at his desk, exhibiting a surliness that&#xD;
well became his appearance. This, it may be&#xD;
well here to remark, was anything but prepos-&#xD;
sessing. He was a short, wiry-built man, with-&#xD;
that disagreeable- expression upbn his austere&#xD;
countenance which is the ineffaceable stamp of&#xD;
bad passions, coined by that mint-master of&#xD;
humanity, the heart. His piercing gray eyes&#xD;
glowered from beneath gray overhanging brows;&#xD;
pegishtsre played around his compressed&#xD;
lips; and,altfiough the top of his narrow head&#xD;
was bald, there was a band of thin, dark hair,&#xD;
grizzled with gray, that came from behind, turn-&#xD;

CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
"A form more active, light and strong,&#xD;
Ne'er shot the ranks of war along;&#xD;
The modest, yet the manly mien,&#xD;
Might grace the court of maiden queen."&#xD;
&#xD;
" Tiu CAMP !" said Alexis to himself, as he&#xD;
sat at the breakfast table with his grandfather,&#xD;
and looked up from a note just handed him by&#xD;
Demetri. Then, after perusing the missive a&#xD;
second time, he asked:&#xD;
"Are there any troops quartered in this vi-&#xD;
cinity ?"&#xD;
"Yes," replied the consul. "Some appre-&#xD;
hend that the revolution just broken out in&#xD;
Greece will extend this way, and a considerable&#xD;
force has been raised by the Turkish authorities.&#xD;
But, why do you ask ?"&#xD;
"I have just received an invitation to visit the&#xD;
camp, this morning, signed by Osmar Bey."&#xD;
" Accept it, by all means. I have never seen&#xD;
him, but learn that he is Christian by birth, and&#xD;
the most daring officer in the Sultan's forces.&#xD;
The ride to the camp is short-just long enough&#xD;
for an invalid, andDemetri shall attend you.&#xD;
Of course you will go in uniform; and I wish to&#xD;
see how'you look in your major's epaulettes."&#xD;
Before Alexis could reply, there was a clatter&#xD;
of hoofs in the court-yard, and he went to the&#xD;
window to ascertain who was' there.. It was a&#xD;
mounted Mameluke, who held by the bridle a&#xD;
spirited Arabian charger, superbly caparisoned,&#xD;
who chawed his bit andproudly tossed his head&#xD;
as if to invite a rider. Now if there was any-&#xD;
&#xD;
thing for which the young officer had a passion,&#xD;
it was a fine horse; so that when Demetri came&#xD;
in with an announcement that the Mameluke had&#xD;
come to offer him the use of the steed below-&#xD;
one of Osmar Bey's own steeds-there was no&#xD;
longer any hesitation. Hastening to his room,&#xD;
he soon arrayed himself in full uniform, and de-&#xD;
scended to the court-yard, where he sprang into&#xD;
the vacant saddle, managing the spirited animal&#xD;
with that graceful self-possession peculiar to mil-&#xD;
itary equestrians.&#xD;
The consul, with several friends and all his&#xD;
clerks, were in the court-yard; and the old gen-&#xD;
tleman's hcart beat high as he heard encomiums&#xD;
lavished upon his grandson. His graceful fig-&#xD;
ure, yielding to the motions of his steed, had&#xD;
that supple grace which leat an additional charm&#xD;
to each well-proportioned limb. The confine-&#xD;
ment of a sick room, too, had so blanched his&#xD;
soft skin that the ruddy blood-tide was visible&#xD;
beneath; while the delight he experienced at&#xD;
finding himself once more in the saddle, gave'&#xD;
life and animation to his frank, open counten-&#xD;
ance. Then his costume-the rich uniform of, a&#xD;
major in the Imperial Hussars-was strikingly&#xD;
beautiful, even in that land of Oriental luxuri-&#xD;
ousness of personal, attire. A tightly-fitting suit&#xD;
of blue cloth was nearly covered with heavy&#xD;

THE RUSSIAN GUARDSMAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
evidently thought that I had interfered solely&#xD;
with a desire to save him from the pacha's scim-&#xD;
etar; nor could I explain to him-unable as I&#xD;
was to converse with him-that I had but sought&#xD;
to quench, an ardent thirst for revenge. My&#xD;
comrades, however, who had witnessed the scene&#xD;
of the morning, knew what had prompted me;&#xD;
and when I entered Cairo with the French army,&#xD;
one of them, disguised as a peasant, denounced&#xD;
me as a renegade. Up to that moment I had&#xD;
never thought of enlisting under the tricolor&#xD;
flag; but I then saw it was my only alternative.&#xD;
The next day I was enrolled among the Maie-&#xD;
luke Guard, and Lieutenant Delmas-for such&#xD;
was the name of my friend-introduced me to&#xD;
General Bonaparte as 'his preserver.' .&#xD;
"Fortunately, I was enabled to preserve the&#xD;

Copts, a Christian race, that. had survived the&#xD;
conquest of the first Califfs, lhe -lst his, way&#xD;
among the ruins of Old Cairo, on foot and unat.&#xD;
tended. I was wandering about, thinking 'of,_&#xD;
Zara, when I encountered him; and, as. he did&#xD;
not recognize me at first, lie drew his small,&#xD;
sword-for Bonaparte was no coward; flints drid&#xD;
scabbards! no. You may imagine that lie did&#xD;
not regret an encouxiter with my scimetar; and&#xD;
lucky was it that I came when I did, for in a&#xD;
few moments we met a fanatic Moslem prophet,&#xD;
who recognized the general, and rushed'at him&#xD;
with his long knife, denouncing him in the name&#xD;
of Mahemet. Stepping in, I was fortunate&#xD;
enough tq arrange the assassin's matters in short&#xD;
order, and thein-just in time, for his cries were&#xD;
attracting a mob,-up came General Monge with&#xD;
an escort. That night I received a sergeant's'&#xD;
warrant, with a sword of honor, and from that&#xD;
day I was French at heart.&#xD;
The camp is over yonder hill, major; and I&#xD;
will clip the wings of my story., Suffice it to' say"&#xD;
that I followed the hero to France, and thefi half&#xD;
over Egrope. Flints and scabbards ! those were&#xD;
campaigns worth fighting in; often, as the gen-&#xD;
eral rode along the line, he would stop and ask,&#xD;
me if I remembered Cairo. Just as if I could&#xD;
forget it! Frenchmen were promoted, and made&#xD;
all sorts of queer-named things; but I wouldn't&#xD;
have taken all the noble titles in the wprld for&#xD;
one pf those kind remembrances, whed his clear,&#xD;
soft voice would make my'heart ring with its&#xD;
pleasing echoes.&#xD;
'"Then he married the Austrian wonian, and,&#xD;
things changed. Flints and scabbardsi how 1&#xD;
&#xD;
hated to see him rigged up as an emperor, with&#xD;
,a crowd of cowards around him; nor was I&#xD;
sorry when he had to put on his gray coat and&#xD;
little cocked-hat again. We went to Russia.&#xD;
Ah! you know, major, what we suffered there.&#xD;
Many dropped on the march and by the watch-&#xD;
fires, the blood gushing from  their eyes and&#xD;
mouth, till death relieved them; whilst others,&#xD;
where they could approach a fire, thrust their&#xD;
frozen and benumbed limbs among the ember%&#xD;
and were burnt without being conscious of suffer-&#xD;
ing, until they expired. We, Mamelukes, as you&#xD;
may imagine, major, suffered cruelly; but a&#xD;
remnant of us remained with the emperor until&#xD;
he reached Wilna. Upwards of forty went to&#xD;
Moscow, but when Napoleon sent for us, a few&#xD;
hours after the horrible journey was ended, only&#xD;
five presented themselves. And how we were&#xD;
changedI The gay Oriental dress, so conspic.&#xD;
uous upon occasions of ceremony, was gone-we&#xD;
paraded in cloaks 'of untanned horse-skin, scorch-&#xD;
ed with. the bivouac fires; our feet wrapped in&#xD;
strips of'carpet,.and our smoke dried faces nearly&#xD;
hid by long matted beards. But when, with a&#xD;
sad yet sweet voice Napoleon thanked, us--ay,&#xD;
and gave each of us the cross of honor -flints&#xD;
agd scabbards i we would'have started back ibr&#xD;
M!oscow if he bad but said the word.&#xD;

until Waterloo. AhI! but we are near e=]R,&#xD;
thank fortune, .and there is no need of talking&#xD;
abont that fatal day. Late at night, whenau1&#xD;
sought to escape, I overtook a general officer,&#xD;
who was wounded, and had sank by.the road-&#xD;

come. Flints and scabbards! it was General&#xD;
Delmas! ,We had begun our campaign in eom-&#xD;

Just- then they were Ascending a hill; an4&#xD;

of Xerxes. No guards were posted, and the&#xD;
Mameluke,-whose name it may be well to men-&#xD;

of the general, before which waved the Turkish&#xD;
flag-a; crescent and' a stair upon a broad green&#xD;
field. Here they dismounted, giving up their&#xD;
horses to a staiwort Nubian, who stood atthe&#xD;

&#xD;
THE RUSSIAN GUARDSMAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
Alexis thanked him for the compliment, and&#xD;
teok an offered'seat, where he had an opportu-&#xD;
nity to look at his host. He was a man of stal-&#xD;
wort frame, whose attitude was naturally haugh-&#xD;
ty, while his every gesture was marked by de-&#xD;
cision and command. His expansive forehead&#xD;
was deeply furrowed; and his pallid cheek was&#xD;
attenuated; yet from beneath his heavy dark&#xD;
eyebrows, bright gleaming eyes, somewhat con-&#xD;
tracted by habitual mistrust, testified that time&#xD;
alone was not chargeable with wrinkles or with&#xD;
emaciation. A short, heavy black beard con-&#xD;
cealed the resolute outline of the lower portion&#xD;
of his face, but left exposed a massive neck, left&#xD;
bare by his Albanian costume. The long, blue&#xD;
tassel of his red cap hung down over his shoul-&#xD;
der; his arms, covered only by a thin chemise,&#xD;
came through the slashed sleeves of a gold-em-&#xD;
broidered jacket, which thus hung as a pelisse,&#xD;
disclosing a tight vest; a flowing white hilt was&#xD;
tightly bound about the waist by a crimson sash;&#xD;
and embroidered gaiters covered yellow suppers.&#xD;
A more beautiful costume Was never worn by&#xD;
Christian or by Infidel..&#xD;
Pipes and coffee were brought by negro boys,&#xD;
and, after a few moments' pause, Osmar, laying&#xD;
down the amber mouth-piece of his snake-like&#xD;
water-pipe, remarked:&#xD;
"I suppose Achmet- has informed you, that&#xD;
we are both soldiers of Franre by education-&#xD;
indeed, your uniform is' the only one associated&#xD;
in my recollection with defeat. But now,*'I&#xD;
trust, the flags under which we fight wave in&#xD;
harmony."&#xD;
'So I trust, also," replied Alexis; "although&#xD;
General Ipsilanti has endeavored to embroil the&#xD;
two powers, in order to carry out some scheme&#xD;
for restoring'the Greek nation."&#xD;
"Foolish ideaI Neither will Capo distria,&#xD;
with his 'IPhilomusians,' do more. Mahmoud is&#xD;
well aware of their plots."&#xD;
"By what chance," inquired Alexis, "is this&#xD;
force congregated here ? Surely, no invasion is&#xD;
feared?"&#xD;
Osmar's brow darkened.&#xD;
"No 1" he replied. "And yet there are hawks&#xD;
whose wings require clipping, for they aspire to&#xD;
the eagle's flight. This is rather a camp of dis-&#xD;
cipline ; and I hope, in return for the pleasure of&#xD;
your visit, to show you tha old warriors of the&#xD;
crescent, ia, g-pany with the yet untried levies&#xD;
who are being trained in the modern school of&#xD;
warfare. I ordered a review at noon, and the&#xD;
triumpets aniouice that the hour is near at hand.'&#xD;
&#xD;
Excuse me until I can put on my regulation'uni-&#xD;
form; for example, as you probably know, goes&#xD;
a great way in introducing a reform."&#xD;
Thus saying, the bey left our yopng hero, and&#xD;
retired to make the contemplated change.&#xD;
In a short time the bey re-appeared, wearing a&#xD;
blue frock-coat and pantaloons of the Eurpean&#xD;
military cut, excepting that a diamond star upon&#xD;
his left breast was a substitute for epaules, as&#xD;
an insignia of' rank. His head-dress was up-&#xD;
changed, anda richly ornamented sabre hung by-&#xD;
a gold-lace belt. Offering his arm to Alekis,&#xD;
they went to the door of the tent, and the young&#xD;
officer's heart'throbbed' with military pride as he&#xD;
sa4 the area before him filled with troops, repos.&#xD;
ing on their arms. A trumpet blast, fio'kon of&#xD;
Osmar Bey's attendants, put all in motion, and'&#xD;
soon they began to defile past.&#xD;
A band of Bedouin cavalry led the van, mount-&#xD;
ed on Arab horses,' whose silky coats almost re-&#xD;
flected 'the brilliancy of their arms.  True dii-&#xD;
ples of the Prophet, Alexis fancied thathe could'&#xD;
trace on their -dark and bearded countenances the&#xD;
religious enthusiasm that made them reckless as&#xD;
to their fate. they passed without any regulari-&#xD;
ty of position; and, when, in front of the bey,&#xD;
began to fire their damascened guns,  which they&#xD;
rapidly reloaded, uttering hoarse, guttural cries.&#xD;
This is he favorite evolution of the Moslem&#xD;
horsemen; and they are the better able to per-&#xD;
form it by the high pommels of their sAddles,&#xD;
'from which one cannot be thrown, and the ex-&#xD;
treme breadth of their stirrup-irons. Their car-&#xD;
touch-pouches and horse equipments, of sHver-&#xD;
mounted scarlet morocco leather, whimsically&#xD;
beautiful in shape, added to the quaintness of&#xD;
their pageantry.&#xD;
Next came the foreign legion of artillery, most-&#xD;
ly composed of Poles, Italians and Frenchmen,&#xD;
who had committed crimes of a nature to neces-&#xD;
sitate their departure from home, and to deter&#xD;
their return. They wore a semi-Oriental uni-&#xD;
form, and looked like a band of desperadoes&#xD;
sans peur, perhaps, but certainly not sans repro.e,&#xD;
The infantry closed the column, of which they&#xD;
composed the greater portion, and were the most&#xD;
complete organization in the "new school" of&#xD;
the Turkish army. Their uniform was of coarse&#xD;
bue cloth, of the 'European pattern, with a red&#xD;
felt cap, and their equipments were from Eng-&#xD;
land'; but to the practised eye of Alexis they pre-&#xD;
sented a worry spectacle. Some carried their bay-&#xD;
onets in the scabbard, at the right side; some&#xD;
on the left; some on their muskets; nor were&#xD;

as the bey said this there was a peculiar expres-&#xD;
sion about his eyes that Alexis never forgot, al-&#xD;

" Well, I hope that the fortune of war will&#xD;
never lead' the son to combat the father."&#xD;

fountain, adieu. Promise to visit me again."&#xD;
'They shook hands cordially; and, having&#xD;
pledged himself that he would soon ride out&#xD;
again, they separated. In a few moments more,&#xD;
Alexis was in the court-yard of the consulate,&#xD;
and gave up his horse to an attendant, who had&#xD;
ridden with them from camp. His grandfather&#xD;
met him at the door and welcomed him 'iome;&#xD;
while old Katina who was in his chamber, when&#xD;
he went up, arranging the curtains, exclaimed:&#xD;
" Why, my young master, how the ride has&#xD;
improved your looks. You have as much color&#xD;
as your father had,.to-night."&#xD;
," My fatherI"&#xD;
"Bless me, I forgot;" and the old lady hob-&#xD;
bled. down stairs, apparently very much dis-&#xD;
gusted with herself for her indiscreet remark.&#xD;
"Why this mystery ?" said Alexis to himself,&#xD;
as lie took off his uniform. "But, never mind,&#xD;
I have a kind grandfather and a noble father-in-&#xD;
arms. Yet I should like to know, and-I will&#xD;
know."'&#xD;
Having arrh'ed at this philosophical axiom,&#xD;
lie concluded his toilette, and went down into'&#xD;
the dining-room, where his ride was made mani-&#xD;
fest by the enormity of his appetite. The old&#xD;
&#xD;
gentleman was very inquisitive; but appeared&#xD;
sorry when he learned how many troops Osniar&#xD;
Bey had collected.&#xD;
"Depend upon it," said he, "there is some&#xD;
trouble brewing, and I fear that our Greek&#xD;
friends will suffer for their desire to re-establish&#xD;
the old Hellenic empire. Every act of their lead-&#xD;
ers but ,serves to awake the fanaticism of the&#xD;
Turks, which, when once , aroused, can only be&#xD;
quenched in blood."&#xD;
The door opened, and in walked Monsieur&#xD;
Lavalette, obsequious as ever, carrying two large&#xD;
account books, which lie laid upon the table.&#xD;
"I cannot show these books to your grandson&#xD;
this evening, Mr. Consul," he said, with a fawn-&#xD;
ing smile, "for Manasseh is in the city, and has&#xD;
sent for us; but his superior knowledge of ae-&#xD;
counts will enable him to find what you seek."&#xD;
"Sent for us !" exclaimed the consul. "Once&#xD;
he used to come cringing here, and wish to loan&#xD;
me money; but now he has involved me some-&#xD;
what in his operations, I have to go to him."&#xD;
" Manasseh-Mnasseh,"   repeated  Alexis.&#xD;
"Where have I heard that name ?"'&#xD;
"You saved. his life, major," replied Laya-&#xD;
lette, "and now he wishes to save your grand-&#xD;
father's credit."&#xD;
"Save my credit ! Thank heaven, he cannot&#xD;
weaken or save it; and to-night I hope to break&#xD;
from his usurious clutches. As to his thanking&#xD;
you, Alexis, perhaps lie fears you will bring a&#xD;
charge against him-ha ! ha ! But if we must&#xD;
go, Monsieur Lavalette, let us star at once.&#xD;
After your ride, young man, you must be fa-&#xD;
tigued-so good night."&#xD;
In a few moments Alexis heard the court-yard&#xD;
gate close.&#xD;

yous, for he waA entirelyunarmed ;,hut, in.order&#xD;
to, satisfy himself as to their intentions, he walked&#xD;
slowly onward,, To his excessive annoyance a&#xD;
glance over his shoulder ocejtsionally ,showed&#xD;
that his atten'dapts maintained the sane, distance,&#xD;
s when he first noted theirpraence. This was&#xD;
unendurable, and he stoppedguddenly-so did&#xD;
they-and when, determined to ascertain wheth-&#xD;
er they were purposely dogging his steps, he&#xD;
turned around. and retraced lis path, the figures&#xD;
steadily retreatedIas he aclvanced-strong pre-&#xD;
sumptive evidence of an alixiety on their part to&#xD;
avoid him as pertinaciously as wAs he desirous&#xD;
of getting rid of, them.&#xD;
But the moment he emerged from the, hallow-,&#xD;
ed precincts of the burial-gropnd, the retreat was&#xD;
stopped; and while he was endeavoring to inake&#xD;
out what sort, of clhaacters were waiting for&#xD;
him, he. was seized by fequ others, who came&#xD;
from some hiding-place. Resistance was impos-&#xD;
sible, and cre he could recover frorn his amaze-&#xD;
ment, he found himself, hangtiffed and gagged,&#xD;
hurried rapidly 9ver the uneven pavement. In&#xD;
a short tinie the plash of water met his ear, and&#xD;
then he saw that they had reached the quay..&#xD;
Here he ivas unceremoniously lifted into a ship's&#xD;
boat, and made to sit inthe strn, where two men&#xD;
held him fast. It is needles ,to say that he was&#xD;
indignant at this brutal treatment, for which he&#xD;
could assign no reason at all sufficient po justify,&#xD;
his detention. He was not aware that he had&#xD;
uttered a word against the government; and had&#xD;
lhe been so ind hercet, they surely would not dare&#xD;
to otrage Rus-sia by thus kidnapping an inmate,&#xD;
of the consulate, who was iu the, emperor's ser-&#xD;
vice. .&#xD;
Who his captp*rs were ho could not well ascer-&#xD;
tain-for their forms were shrouded h large&#xD;
cloaks, while handkerchiefs muffled their faces.&#xD;
He waspositive, however, tht one 9f them was,&#xD;
a mulatto; and this but added to thei.;yst-y of&#xD;
his position-for he did no , remember have&#xD;
seen eneof tfe doomed, mco since his arrival.&#xD;
Four other nen were in h e' boat, nd  lexis&#xD;

boat. He inquired,.ii Ita ian,for the captain.&#xD;
"He went 9n bo4rd in.afisian's boat that&#xD;
started about tyo heurs ago," replied the mi&#xD;
latto. "Tracking game is. not his favorite pr-&#xD;
suit, and he said that he would go on board to&#xD;
get the anchor tripped and have the sails loosen-&#xD;
ed. But where's the consignee I"&#xD;
"The old gentleman sent m i h this letter,&#xD;
telling me to give it to the captain, and to sAy&#xD;
that he, wished him to set sail at once."&#xD;
"-Give me the lette-, then, and off we'll gp."&#xD;
Taking the package, and putting it in his bat,&#xD;
he gave orders to have the boat cast off. TheA,&#xD;
resuming his seat by the side of Alexis, hp tqok&#xD;
the tiller and the bet shot out into the broad&#xD;
bay. They passed so .near. the "Nicolai " that&#xD;
Alexis could hear the measured tread of the sen-&#xD;
tries on deck; but it was impossible for him to&#xD;
make the lesst movement. A few. moments&#xD;
more, it was evident that the boat was making&#xD;
towards a beautiful lugger, that. Bat upon the&#xD;
water like a sea-bird at rest, with her huge wing.&#xD;
like sails hangig lose, as if waiting to sweep.&#xD;
away in quest of prey. S§he had two tall mqsts,&#xD;
with long-pointed yar4s, upon which clouds of&#xD;
canvass could be spread ; while a small mizen-&#xD;
mast carried a small sail, used to keep her jam-&#xD;
med 'up to the wind whedclose-hauled. Every-&#xD;
thing about her appeared to, be in theqgest order;&#xD;
and 'as her outline, with its tracery of rigging&#xD;
was visible'in the mqonllght, Alexis thought her&#xD;
the most beautiful specirpen of marine architec-&#xD;
turq he had ever, seen.&#xD;
"Vho comes ?" hailed a gruff voice from the,&#xD;
forecastle.&#xD;
"The 'Dolphin,' cried the. mulatto. ," Call&#xD;

side of the luggpr. ,A (all form appeared at the,&#xD;

"You are a soldier, fIr"'sid he, "-and must ,&#xD;

'There was a frankness anid cordiality about&#xD;
these 'remarks that"pleased Alexis'although he&#xD;
felt indignant at the'ouirage committed in thus&#xD;
entrapping him-neither cald he comprehend&#xD;
the motivee for sending 'hii to Greece, or the au-&#xD;
thority'under which he was sent. Thd mulatto,&#xD;
however, taking him by'the arm, led himto the&#xD;
companion-way, and'there was no alternative but&#xD;
to descend with as god a grace as possible. He&#xD;
was shown into a beatitiful little cabin, furnished&#xD;
with great elegance, and brightly lighted by' a&#xD;
hanging lamp. 'Cato remained'ai the door; but&#xD;
his companion followed Alexis'in, and, when the&#xD;
door was closed, threw off his cloak and muffler.&#xD;
It was Achmet, the Mameluke!'&#xD;
"Fortune of war," said the old trooper. "The&#xD;
duty has not been a' pleasmint one; but, as the&#xD;
captain said just now, 'oders must be obeyed.'&#xD;
Now,imajor, I am bid to'elease you from those&#xD;
outrageous ropes if you will but promise me that&#xD;
you will not attempt to escape to-night."&#xD;
Really siffer-ing froi th6 tightness of" the cor-&#xD;
dage that bound Iis handi,-and from the gag&#xD;
that distended his mouth,! Alexis bowed assent.&#xD;
Indeed, curiosity was fast ustrping every other&#xD;
sentiment, and the mysteiy of Nis position ap-&#xD;
peare' to increase. The honest soldier 1ot no&#xD;
time in ieleitiighim'bhimtshook ls head at the&#xD;

&#xD;
"Whee ate we I Why am* hire ?2     n&#xD;

Ahmajor, ask me no questions tonight"&#xD;

But take iome refieshment."&#xD;
There wa4 a'haidsome, cold collation on6 the'&#xD;
table, elegantly served, with rich crystal and, ele-&#xD;
gant silver ware. For a moment Alexis hesi-&#xD;
tated ; but the cola air had give'i him a famous&#xD;
appetite, and he thought that he might make the&#xD;
best of his position. A small state-room, open-&#xD;
ing from the cabin, was pointed out by Achmet,&#xD;
who served him with great attention, and really&#xD;
appeared sad as he Wished him:&#xD;
91Good night, ana pleasant dreams."&#xD;
Alas!. the dreams were confusoid enough; and&#xD;
when, on waking, Alexis knew'by the rushing&#xD;
sound of waters on the side of the vessel, against&#xD;
whibhihis berth rested, that the 1-telucca was un-.&#xD;
derweigh. Loking around the' state-room, he&#xD;
was astonished to see his own trunks, that had&#xD;
been placed there during "his sleep, and, rising,'&#xD;
he dressed himself in his undress-unifoim, de-&#xD;
termined to ascertain by what authority he had'&#xD;
been thus carried off. The door, he observed,&#xD;
wa  lightly ajar, and when his toilette was"&#xD;
completed, he went out, and ascended 'the'com-&#xD;
panion-way.&#xD;
There was nothing in' sight but blue sky and&#xD;
blue water. The wind was fair, swelling the&#xD;
towering sails'of the felucca, that bounded on-&#xD;
vard, parting the wave before her, and scattering&#xD;
the spray around. Never had Alexis seen such,&#xD;
a beautiful craft, for everything was kept neatly,&#xD;
scrubbed or. painted; and the our brassguns&#xD;
on either side shone like mirrors. There was a&#xD;
'flag displayed from the gaff of' the small mizen-&#xD;
mAast; but the colors were inot those of any Eu-&#xD;
ropean power then in existence, although there&#xD;
was nothing piratical in the large blue 'cross,&#xD;
floating on a white field. While he waS thus'&#xD;
gazing around, a lady emerged from a stern com-'&#xD;
panion-way; nor had'she fairly stepped upon the&#xD;
deck before he recognized ElissalI Advancing to-:&#xD;
wards her he was rejoiced to see that she recog-&#xD;
nized him.&#xD;
"Thanks at last !" she said, in a low, sweet,&#xD;
tone, "for the service you rendered us ;"'and sh e&#xD;
held-out her hand.&#xD;
Alexis, encouraged -by this kind. receptionf,&#xD;
took the proffered hand, and in his conxilfsion&#xD;
stamniered oat something about'"uins eit d&#xD;
leasure..&#xD;
&#xD;
Sqme," she replied, "letus,sit dowp,.for it&#xD;
is not very easy tokeep.on  feet 's ."&#xD;
The young officer toOk a peat by her side,&#xD;
and eagerly gazed upon her, as if to ascertain&#xD;
whether lie had, pictured her rightly. Nor was&#xD;
he mappouted. Eissawas one of those beau.&#xD;
tiful creatures occasionally met with, who realize&#xD;
those creations of loveliness with which youth-&#xD;
ful imagination peoples fairy-land. Her classic&#xD;
face was worthy of a sculptor's study, while her&#xD;
clear hazel eyes, pure forehead and luxuriant&#xD;
hair, were combined in the effect produced by&#xD;
her loveliness. The expression of her counte-&#xD;
nance varied with every emotion, and her voice&#xD;
was soothing as the night-wind vibrating through&#xD;
a vineyard. She wore a Greek dress, 'alhodgh'&#xD;
the boddice was fitted to her graceful figure, in-&#xD;
stead of flowing loosely. Richly'embroidered&#xD;
slippers, covering only the front of the foot,&#xD;
showed to full advantage her delicately-turned&#xD;
ankles, visible through stockings of gosime,r-like&#xD;
netted silk; while the black silk Maltese veil&#xD;
shad4 but.qid not conceal, the delicate contgur&#xD;
of her head.&#xD;
The gallant exploit of Alexis, with his subse-&#xD;
quent illness, naturally formed the introductory&#xD;
topicof conversatio', and it was not long'before&#xD;
there was a cordial communication between them.&#xD;
There is no place like a deck for breaking down&#xD;
the, conventional barriers raised by society; nor&#xD;
hA   Alexis evqr been so cordially received.&#xD;
BEissa's voice trembled' with genine emotion&#xD;
as she thanked him again and again; while her&#xD;
compmion felt that he had not over-valued her&#xD;
in his thoughts and his dreams,&#xD;
A step was heard ascending the companion-way,,&#xD;
and the captain came on deck. Alexis, who had&#xD;
not forgotten his wrongs and his position' sprang&#xD;
to his feet, and glanced a look of haughty&#xD;
defiance.&#xD;
"ajor Orloff," said the captain, "I am hap-&#xD;
py to see you on deck, and tp find that you have&#xD;
introduced yourself ,to Madenoiselle Elissa.",&#xD;
"Nay, sir;" timidly interrupted the blusliing&#xD;
girl, "this is the gallant officer of whom I spoke,&#xD;
yesterday-he who risked his life to save&#xD;
uncle."        '-&#xD;
"Captain," asked Alexis, "you are undoubt-&#xD;
ely a gentldman. Why was I abducted from&#xD;
my grandfather's residence to .be thus carried&#xD;
off?-for if I was not.in the consulate, my bag-I&#xD;
gage was% taken fron there. I have a right,air,&#xD;
to demand an imnpediate explanation.".&#xD;
"Sofar 4I am coicornAmed, muAjor," replied the&#xD;
&#xD;
captain, "you received .st night ljhe expla-&#xD;
nation that I can give. like yourselfsir Ihold&#xD;
a conmmsion,-having the honor to be a lieuten&#xD;
ant in the British navy, although I now am ou&#xD;
furlough, commanding this felucca. I introduce&#xD;
myself toyou as Captaig Maxpell. Po no, I&#xD;
beg' of you      , make my duty unpleasant to my-&#xD;
self, or disagreeable to my involuntary passen-&#xD;
ger."&#xD;
"But what is this vessel ?"&#xD;
"The 'Dolphin,'-a yacht, belonging to an&#xD;
eecentric English peer (with whom I was at&#xD;
Harrow School), and now a volunteer in the&#xD;
Greek cause. The struggle is for independence;&#xD;
nor popmld any service be more congenial to my&#xD;
ledlings than was this command, until I was or-&#xD;
dered to arrest, clandestinely, an officer and a&#xD;
gentleman,."&#xD;
"Nay, nay," exclairpeil Alexis,,who saw that&#xD;
Elissawas anxiously 1eatching the conversation.&#xD;
"All is air in wa; and   suppose there is some&#xD;
reason for all this. At any rate, the company of&#xD;
this young lady, whom I have muc desired, to&#xD;
meet, compensates me for the absence from&#xD;
Smyrna, and I feel positive, sir, that you will&#xD;
not see me dealtgithwrongly."&#xD;
The tw9 young men thenshook hands cordial-&#xD;
ly, and Alexis resumed his seat by Elissa, while&#xD;
the captain' went forward, where he was soon en-&#xD;
gaged with Cato, the mulatto mate, in disciplin-&#xD;
ing a portion of the crew. No man-of-war's ipen&#xD;
could ha&amp;amp;ve handled the guns with more alacrity,&#xD;
or wielded their cutlasses with more deterity&#xD;
But the lovers cared little for what was pass-&#xD;
ing around them, as they sat together, chgry of&#xD;
wbrds but prodigal in glances. 'Alexishad not&#xD;
declared his passion, ytlissa felt conscious&#xD;

that o whih the -delegates met for the first ime.&#xD;
It was an important step, and each on' left his&#xD;
temporary abode, with the 'conscionieess 'that a'&#xD;
halter wAs aroundhis neck, for they had nothing&#xD;
to hope fr6m their desyotic taasters, who only tol-&#xD;
erated their very religion for the sake of exacting.&#xD;
money from its votaries., Bidding farewell' to&#xD;
their friends, they threadedtheir way to the'place&#xD;
of rendezvous, that was beyond the bazaars, in&#xD;
an unfre~uented portion of the city. Tottering&#xD;
buildings projected over the muddy paveidnts;&#xD;
dismantled chimney -'tops, nodding overhead,&#xD;
seemed hesitating when- to fall;,the lower win-&#xD;
dows wre guarded with rusty iron bars, that&#xD;
timehad longgnawed atwith hiacorroding tooth;&#xD;
nor was a single repulsive Ihteament of poverty'&#xD;
or filth wanting.&#xD;
Yet, to 'the conspirators, the pathway was as&#xD;
it strewn with'rokes, a each hitriied to the hp'-&#xD;
pointed' hoise. a    1 ell-known locliy -oi ''l&#xD;
who had been there before. Knocking, theyI&#xD;
were ushered into a "small room, alhnost desti-&#xD;
tute 'of furniture, -and dimly lighted by a 'burni-I&#xD;
ing rag, that floated on a cork in a pan filled&#xD;
with oil. Here, one of the ringleaders, disguised&#xD;
as an old crone, assured himself that the new I&#xD;
comer was one of the initiated, and then, tduch-&#xD;
ing a spring, swnng a large corner-cupboard -out&#xD;
from where it *as, apparently, a fixture. Steps&#xD;
were disclosed ; and, on descending thom, a new&#xD;
barrier presented itself in a heavily-ironed door, r&#xD;
opened upon a peculiar knock. On again, though&#xD;
a vaulted passage, another door was reached;&#xD;
and, on crossing its portal, a novel sight presented t&#xD;
itself.                                     a&#xD;
It was a subterranean hall; its roof supported t&#xD;
by scores'of w hite marble columns-one of those a&#xD;
Byzantine reservoirs that remain as monumtids A&#xD;
of their architectural skill, and of their desire to A&#xD;
store for use that pure clement, the source of all p&#xD;
life. But, in some of the old wars, the arches of b&#xD;
its suplying aqueduct had been destroyed, and&#xD;
its very existence forgotten, until a Greek, in c'&#xD;
digging a well, had discovered its arched ex- a&#xD;
pane. Jealottsly guarding his secret, except.to .1&#xD;
the principal men of his race; the old cistern was&#xD;
thenceforth used as a. hiding-place for oppressed' ti&#xD;
Greeks, and the entrance, that we have described, M&#xD;
built. It was the very place for the delegates to' si&#xD;
assemble in council-nor had pains been spared&#xD;
in fitting it up A long table, with benches on eli&#xD;
either side, was placed in the centre, while above or&#xD;
an arm-chair, at 'one end of it, hung the cross-&#xD;
banner of the Morea.                        fr&#xD;
&#xD;
'he delegates, as they entered, separatediiito&#xD;
little groups, earnestig disessinig the hop esof&#xD;

and then a loud, iear voice echoed along 'the&#xD;
vaulted wall&#xD;
"Sons 'of Gieece'!' assemble at the council-&#xD;
board 1"&#xD;
It was 'Mavrocordato.' He had ben earnestly&#xD;
invited t'o head the' movement, and now stood&#xD;
at the-e'd of the tjlcle, a type of his nation.&#xD;
His Albanian dress , w'ith its hanging sleeves, its&#xD;
flowing white kir'ts, ud rich embroidery, gave&#xD;
that winning dignity to, hi form With which' the&#xD;
classics clothe his' hone, His 'xpressi  Was&#xD;

cloak around him with a theatrical air, the indig-&#xD;
nant Frenchman turne- from the table as if to&#xD;
leave.&#xD;
"Stay !" said Botzaris, advancing towards&#xD;
tavalette, with a flushed 'countenance and an&#xD;
opposing gesture. "I regret that our first-meet-&#xD;
ing has hoen sullied by the presence of'a traitor;&#xD;
but, thank Heaven! the traitor is not a Greek !"&#xD;
" What means this ?" asked Mavrocordato.&#xD;
The whole assemblage listened with eager&#xD;
suspicio n, and Lavalette felt, a faint dizziness&#xD;
cross his brain. But, in a moment, desperation&#xD;
steeled his heart, and he sought to fortify his&#xD;
trembling limbs as he asked, with a look of in.&#xD;
jured pride:&#xD;
"What means this, I too ask ? Does the pali-&#xD;
'kar, from ihe Morea, accuse me of treachery I-&#xD;
me, a poor accountant, who learned when a child,&#xD;
to love liberty in France !"&#xD;
"Friends," said lotzaris, ".be not deceived&#xD;
with. his soft voice, or his blad smile-"&#xD;
"Yet," interrupted Odysseus, " we want to&#xD;
hear your accusation 1,&#xD;
"You shall hdar it! Tell me, Lavalette, you,&#xD;
who are, to use your own wo ids, 'a poor ac-&#xD;
countant,' whence came, the moneyfor your&#xD;
purchase of .the Zalanti estate, a$ Scio. You&#xD;
must have a large6 salai to be enabled to expend&#xD;
thirty thousand di-chms for a country-o"se."&#xD;
"It w.s saved-economically saved," dog-&#xD;
&#xD;
gey replied Lavalette, "-Besides, my niee&#xD;
recQived a legacy from.France."&#xD;
"And it is your niece who Pas hired the  o,.&#xD;
phin' lugger until Lord Byron returns, from&#xD;
England  . It is your niece who receives pack-&#xD;
ages fromthebey, who occupies the -ciot gar-&#xD;
rison?'"&#xD;
"Nay,-it is-it is-&#xD;
"Is who 1" interrupted the excited Greek.&#xD;
"Manassqh," replied Lavalette-who qnyeav-&#xD;
ored as he spoke to look his accuser full in the.&#xD;
face; but his eyes quailed before :the searching&#xD;
glance that met them.&#xD;
"And who is thi Manasseh?    No Israelite,&#xD;
I,am informed by the rabbi of the, synagogue&#xD;
here, for I have made inquiries."&#xD;
"If Acquaintance with Manasseh be a crime,"&#xD;
exclaimed Odysseus, "then I am a criminal,&#xD;
ao. Jew pr Qhristip lo may.b-l cae not;&#xD;
but I know that he has, pgyrphased five: hundred&#xD;
carbines at Marseilles, for the, Macedonian JVha-&#xD;
lanx, that I hope to lead to. victory. If this is&#xD;
treason to Greece, I wish that we had more&#xD;
traitors !"&#xD;
" Really," said Mavrocordato, "I do not see&#xD;
through this business."&#xD;
" It is light that I ask," cried Botzaris. "This&#xD;
Manasseh, be he friend or-foe, has ever been the&#xD;
guest of this pallid knave, while in Smyrna;&#xD;
and he has also been the host of one who thirsts&#xD;
for our blood. Nay, Lavalette, start not. I came&#xD;
here with a certitude that I might be betrayed,&#xD;
and took a farewell of my wife and daughters;&#xD;
but I came here prepared to die like a man, face&#xD;
to face with my foes. Nor have I been asleep.&#xD;
I have visited the camp where a force is now in&#xD;
training to destroy .our homes, and to quench&#xD;
our hearth-fires with blood. The leader of that&#xD;
force is a Christian renegade, who has eaten at&#xD;
Greek boards, and professed to love. Greek&#xD;
friends. But now he thirsts for our destruction.&#xD;
This, Lavalette, you know; and yet, deny it&#xD;
not, Osmar Bey is often your guest. Mysteri-&#xD;
ously, too, does he come by night, meeting with&#xD;
Manasseh, and going away no ote knows how.&#xD;
For this, gentlemen, soldiers, Greeks, I plesige&#xD;
my word; and, from the cnyictions of my&#xD;
heart, I arrest and denounce this -pale French-&#xD;
man as a spy-as a traitor to the cause he voluna&#xD;
teers to sesive."&#xD;
All eyes were directed to the  ceeused, upon&#xD;
whose pallid cheeks were small crilnson spots,&#xD;
glowing like two coals of. fit, while the 'blood&#xD;
upon his united lips showed, conclusively by&#xD;
&#xD;
THE RUSSIAN GUARDSMAN.'&#xD;
&#xD;
hew severe an efort he had suppressed a vindic-&#xD;
tiye reply.&#xD;
"Lavalette," said the presiding *Acer, " what&#xD;
explanation can you offer of this I"&#xD;
"None, alas !" was the reply, in a meek, quiet&#xD;
tone, utterly at valance with his malignant&#xD;
glance, "That Osmar Bey has been at my&#xD;
house, I will admit-nay, he is there now, or I&#xD;
am mistaken--"&#xD;
"1He is, or was half an hour ago," interrupted&#xD;
ABotzaris.I&#xD;
"And this, noble palikar," continued' Lava-&#xD;
lette, "was probably what gamesters term  a&#xD;
C trump-card,' which you have'held in reserve, in&#xD;
order to brand me with infamy before this as-&#xD;
semblage. Had you been more cautious in -our&#xD;
demeanor I would have told it mysellfor My&#xD;
intimacy with this man is one which might have&#xD;
'been turned to great accounit in the impending&#xD;
struggle. Nay, I now hold in .cio, a hostage for&#xD;
which he would liberate every man here, did the-&#xD;
fortunes of war thiow them in hisspower. That&#xD;
hostage is the magnet which has attracted the&#xD;
haughty bey to my home. It is to hear xews of&#xD;
her that he is there now.. It was to afford a shel-&#xD;
ter for her that h gave me'gold to buy a house&#xD;
at Scio. Ay,-aidit is through her that Iexpect"&#xD;
to carry out a long-nursed scheme of revenge&#xD;
upon him! There you all have it; and may you,&#xD;
Botzaris, make the most of it. I am here, a,&#xD;
feeble old man, unemed, without friends! Seek'&#xD;
ye to baptine ihis'asseiblage with blood? Strike&#xD;
---the Victin is readyl1"&#xD;
The earnest manner in which he spoke, not&#xD;
only carried conviction to 'the hearts of many&#xD;
present that Lavalette was innocent, but made&#xD;
Botzaris stagger in his belief. The palikar had&#xD;
stopped at Seo, on 'his way to Smyrna, for it was&#xD;
there that he uad wooed and won his wife, and&#xD;
he had accidentAlly learned that Lavalette-&#xD;
thought to be a poor clerk-had purchased a fie&#xD;
&#xD;
estate. Then, coming to Smyrna with a vener-&#xD;
able Jew, he heard Manasseh denounced as&#xD;
playing some foul game under the garb of that&#xD;
uch-abused race, and also heard that he could&#xD;
only be traced to the clerk's house. Further in-&#xD;
quiries but added to their mysterious connection:;&#xD;
and when he discovered that the Turkish general&#xD;
was somewise mingled in the intrigue, his suspi-&#xD;
cions had been aroused. But now that the object&#xD;
of his jealous watchfulness had avowed the most&#xD;
apparently criniina4 part 'of his conduct, and had&#xD;
given such good reason for it, the noble-hearted&#xD;
Greek feared that he might have had no founda-&#xD;
tion for his suspicion.&#xD;
"Palikars 1" exclaimed Odysseus, "what'think&#xD;
ye now? Could we have a more triumphant&#xD;
eridicatiol!"&#xD;
princece," said Miaulis, '"I have heard all,&#xD;
seen all-and we, sailors, have a prompt way of&#xD;
act*ig. 'm4y felucca is at anchor close by, and&#xD;
bylaylight I hope that her white sails will gleam&#xD;
tin'ough the bay for Syra, and thence to Scio.&#xD;
'o let this friend of Odysseus come with me,&#xD;
and I will bring him back with a report before&#xD;
the next new moon."&#xD;
"Wel said,"'exclaimed Bttaris ; and a mur-&#xD;
mur of assent showed that all approved of the&#xD;
pret.&#xD;
" Let mne go hotne," said Lavalette, "and&#xD;
*"Nay, -comrade," interrupted Miaulis, "if all&#xD;
is well ybu need no arrangements. Besides, your&#xD;
niece is -at Beio-and, by the saints, you must go&#xD;
there, also!",&#xD;
There was no alternativeand Lavalette was&#xD;
escorted directly to theIGreek lucca. His only&#xD;
hope was that the consul had become tired of&#xD;
waiting, and had left his honse without seeing&#xD;
any one. He forgot that, in his embarrassment,&#xD;
he had turned the key of the chamber, thus ren-&#xD;
dering this impossible.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7476-00000018"/>&#xD;
PECUiAlrr Durnicns06r. Lucky-was it for&#xD;
the "most patient of all men " that "bills pay,&#xD;
able" were unknown in Idumea, or he could&#xD;
have been easily entangled into tomplaint. Even&#xD;
Consul Orloff, who had passed through life with&#xD;
grave indifference, each disappointment case-har-&#xD;
dening his heart with stoicism,, now found him-&#xD;
self fiarassed by business affairs-and this at the&#xD;
very time when his nephew's recovery should&#xD;
have made hin happy, without a cloud of care.&#xD;
The truth was, that he had become a prey to the&#xD;
secret machinations of Lavalette, and of Manas-&#xD;
seh, who had gradually entangled himin their&#xD;
meshes until there was no possibility of his es-&#xD;
cape from bankruptcy. Yet the wily French-&#xD;
man had so falsified the entries in his ledgers,&#xD;
that everything appeared in a prosperous condi-&#xD;
tion; and the only ground for a suspicion of&#xD;
danger, which of late had begun to annoy his em-&#xD;
ployer, was a constant demand for fresh capital.&#xD;
When this was first wanted,-for previously the&#xD;
consul had been the architect of his own fortune,&#xD;
-Lavalette had introduced Manasseh, as having&#xD;
idle capital, which he wished to invest at a mod-&#xD;
erate interest, where it would be safe in case of a.&#xD;
revolution. The consul, nothing loth, had thus&#xD;
taken loan after loan, until he had more than&#xD;
borrowed the amount of his home property-&#xD;
although he fancied that he had large amounts&#xD;
to his credit in the hands of distant consignees.&#xD;
&#xD;
The necessity of calling on M aassch was tie&#xD;
first positive humiliation; and it was with feel-&#xD;
ings of angry montification that, the old gentle'&#xD;
man left the consulate early on :the evening&#xD;
which-in its later hours'-was marked by the&#xD;
events already nanated. , As they wlkd along&#xD;
he fancied that Lavalette's manner was changed,&#xD;
and that the replies to his questions were evasive,'&#xD;
and were given in rather an insolent tone, which&#xD;
appeared strange from one whohsd ever been so&#xD;
obsequious. What answers were given,. as tv&#xD;
the different balances to the consul's credit i&#xD;
foreign ports, were widely different from his&#xD;
mental account-current, and came as flashes,&#xD;
which only contributed to discover the darkness&#xD;
lowering over his affairs. At length they reached&#xD;
the Jews' quarter, where the, descendants of the&#xD;
"chosen people" were seated at the doors of&#xD;
coffee-houses, recounting the traditions of theii&#xD;
nation's glory.- A few steps beyond the limit,&#xD;
and they arrived at Lavalette's house.&#xD;
It was the first time that the consul had ever&#xD;
crossed the threshold, and he had no idea that fie&#xD;
'was in the dwelling of his book-keeper-although&#xD;
he was somewhat surprised to see Lavalette&#xD;
open the outside door by pushing a concealed&#xD;
spring, and hold it that he might enter,&#xD;
" This 'way, Mr. Consul," said he; and, as he&#xD;
went up stairs, followed by his enipo'yee, a sat-&#xD;

"-What newtOdyssetis1' I did not expect'to&#xD;

"Neither did I expect to come," replied the&#xD;
young mat, who Wore' the gay Suliote dress,&#xD;
with its flowing "ftstaielle,' rlehly ornatnented&#xD;
'rins, and tasselled scarlet cap. His counte-&#xD;
nance had that voluptuous, yet noble look which,&#xD;
the' ancient sculptors 'embodied in Pentellican&#xD;
marble ; anr lis shining black eyes gleamed. as&#xD;
tlouisgh they were destined to light his path at,&#xD;
inidnight. " To-night, howeve  a treasurer is&#xD;

"But, nmy' dear Odysseus-"&#xD;

Lavalette bit IAis nailswith vexa'tion-fbr he&#xD;
desired the office of treasurer to the revolutiohists&#xD;
in 'order to catry out his plots, yet he feriied td&#xD;
leave the'consul. Another ,day, and he could&#xD;
defy hime; but a thought came to his relief.&#xD;
"Tell ie,' taid he, "can Inot return here&#xD;
Soon, for I'have a visitor up stairs."&#xD;
"fIa! ha! some lady comes to enliven the&#xD;
evenings of the accountant ?l"&#xD;
Lavalette made a ghastly attempt to smile at&#xD;

"Well, Wait here h -ihatatit, while I go up&#xD;

He thenwent to the rooin in which he had left&#xD;
the consul,.and made some stammering excuses,&#xD;
promising to return in a few moment. Not&#xD;
waiting a .-eply, he descended to the lower floor,&#xD;
gave a message to his- servant, and then rejoined&#xD;
Odysseub.&#xD;
" Here you are, with the dew of her kissed on&#xD;
your lips. Now. let us be; off, for Mavrocordato&#xD;
is to preside, and the oldfellow has not much&#xD;
more patiene than I hveo"&#xD;
They left Ahe house.; and we have pr-yol&#xD;
recorded what befell Lavalette at the meeting of&#xD;
revolutionists. . He little dreamed, as he crossed&#xD;
the threshold, that lie would never again visit&#xD;
the harbor of so many plotp-the web, where he&#xD;
had lay concealed, year after year, as he spun&#xD;
his threads of guilt.&#xD;
We will now return to.Consul Orloff, who was&#xD;
thus left alone in an upper chamber, inastate&#xD;
of suspense, the most.insupportable of all phases&#xD;
of life; There had been something in his book-&#xD;

afierleaf, while, occasionally, a swile of triumph&#xD;
gleamed over his stern features. At times lie&#xD;
was tempted to knock on.tle-window, and tie-&#xD;
mand an explanation; but prudence counselled&#xD;
;him to, remain quiet, -and unravel, if possible,&#xD;
this strange proceeding.&#xD;
Again the ring at the enter door was rattled;&#xD;
but, before the consul could gain the window,&#xD;
the new-comer had entered., ItWas,'he thought,&#xD;
Lavalette-and now there would be some action,&#xD;
But the footsteps wer far heavier, as they. ap-&#xD;
proached, than was the cat-like tread of the wily,&#xD;
Frenchman, and they passed by, also, to the.next&#xD;
room. Again did the old man act a part which,.&#xD;
under any other circumstances, he would have&#xD;
scorned., Posting -himself at the window, lie not,&#xD;
_only saw what passed, but easily heard every&#xD;
word spoken.&#xD;
The new comer was a mulatto, dressed in the&#xD;
well-known garb ef an English sailor. A Wide&#xD;
shirt collar, carelessly tied with a blacksilk&#xD;
handkerchief, felt far on the shoulders of his&#xD;
blue jacket, on the front of which were thick&#xD;
rows of bright buttons. Extravagantly, large&#xD;
white trowaers came oyer -eatly-fitting pumps;&#xD;
and, in his hand, he twirle :a straw hat, With&#xD;
some word, in golden letters, upon its broad&#xD;
ribbon.&#xD;
0 Is all ready fortsea'i" inquired Manassehb&#xD;
"Ay, ay, your honor,-the 'Dolphin  i a-&#xD;

"Did Captain Maxwell send, mc anymep-,&#xD;

cessaryi It will be better not to arrest him iai&#xD;

"What !" thought the consul, "am I to be,&#xD;
'carried off by force - At any rate, they do not&#xD;
expect that I am here, and I will remain quiet.&#xD;
Where can Lavalette be V"&#xD;
"Get him out dbors," Manasseh continued,&#xD;
"and then pounce upon him. You shall have a&#xD;
iuuidred pillared dollars each, if you are obedi-&#xD;
ent and successful; but harm a hair of his head,&#xD;
and I will string you up like your own sails.&#xD;
Now start, and, when you leave the quay, tell&#xD;
Achmet to send me a report by the non-commis-&#xD;
sioned officer of the men you take to aid you."&#xD;
The mulatto bowed, put on his hat, and left&#xD;
the room. Manasseh continued his examination&#xD;
of the books, but soon closed them, consulted his&#xD;
watch, and then went down stairs. A few mo-&#xD;
ments more, and the street resounded with tle&#xD;
clatter of horses' hoofs,- and again the consul&#xD;
repaired to the window. It was a small party&#xD;
of Turkish cavalry ; and, at their head, a mount-&#xD;
ed Nubian held the rein of a led horse. Dis-&#xD;
mounting, the Nubian rattled the door-ring, and&#xD;
ere long the unknown stranger . came out. The&#xD;
consul, placed almost directly over the door-way&#xD;
in which he stood, could not distinguish his fea-&#xD;
tures; but,, as he vaulted into the saddle of the'&#xD;
led horse, a thick, black beard was distinctly vis-&#xD;
ible, exactly like that'which had so changed the&#xD;
features of Manasseh. His voice, too, sounded&#xD;
like that of the Jew, as he inquired:&#xD;
" Has the guard left the barracks with Ach-&#xD;
met ?"&#xD;
"CHalf an hour ago, your highness," replied&#xD;
the Nubian.&#xD;
"Then I will go and await their report ere I&#xD;
leave for the camp."&#xD;
Touching his fine Arabian with the spur, the&#xD;
spirited animal sprang forward at a gallop, and&#xD;
the others following, were soon out of sight.&#xD;
Never was a man more complete'y bewildered&#xD;
&#xD;
than was COnsul Orloff. In vain did he seek *&#xD;
unravel the tangled web, but could not gain any&#xD;
satisfactory clue.7Lavalette did not return.-4be&#xD;
heard iothing more oft Manasseh-aid -the*i&#xD;
was, evideitly, a plot for his forcible abdUction.&#xD;
.His heart sank withia..him, as he balanced his&#xD;
chances of escape, of solvency, and he sat at ,the&#xD;
win4ow4.u-until sleep cast her comfortirag miantle&#xD;
over him.&#xD;
Thm morning gun boomed ,rom the citadel,&#xD;

risiOngun greeted him as he looked from-the&#xD;
window-while the street below 'was filled by&#xD;
Turks, summoned to their morning devotions by&#xD;
the "muezzins," calling the faithful to prayer&#xD;
from the galleries of the mosque minarets. It&#xD;
was no dream, and, he looked about for some&#xD;
way to escape. The lock- of the door was put&#xD;
on the inner-side, and with the aid of a table-&#xD;
knife, which he found in the closet, he soon lib-&#xD;
erated himself. Descending the staircase with&#xD;
as little noise as possible, he reached the street&#xD;
door,.pushed back the bolts, and once more was&#xD;
at liberty. Nor was it long ere lie again entered&#xD;
the court-yard of the consulate.&#xD;
" The saints be praised !" exclaimed Katrina,&#xD;
who met him at the door. "My dear -master,&#xD;
where have you been ?"&#xD;
Making a vague reply, the consul hurried up&#xD;
ino the room of his nephew-but it was empty.&#xD;
The bed had evidently not been disturbed, and&#xD;
all of the young officer's trunks were gone.&#xD;
Here was another source-of wonder, and the al-&#xD;
most distressed old man rang the bell. Demetri&#xD;
.responded to the summons.&#xD;
" Where is the major ?" he asked, ere the do-&#xD;
mestic had fairly crossed the threshold.&#xD;
"Indeed, Mr. Consul, I do not know. Some&#xD;
of the man-of-war's men came here late last&#xD;
night, and said he had sent them forhis trunks,&#xD;
and I did not like to refuse them."&#xD;
"But the major ?"&#xD;
"I have not seen him, sir, since last evening.&#xD;
Captain Paskewitsch is'down stairs, and may tell&#xD;
you."&#xD;
The consul hurried down, his mind agitated&#xD;
by forebodings of ill.,&#xD;
" My dear captain," said he, "why have you&#xD;
abducted Alexis ?"&#xD;
Somewhat astonished, the captain could not&#xD;
explain himself at first; nor was his surprise&#xD;

&#xD;
was evidently somewhat bewildered ; nor did&#xD;
Lord Byron cease to tantalize him about being&#xD;
an aid to the enemies, instead of the friends of&#xD;
Greece. The repast over, they went on deck,&#xD;
where Lord Byron mingled with the erew, who&#xD;
almost appeared to worship him. Then, bidding&#xD;
Alexis farewell, he stepped into a boat, which&#xD;
had been sent from the other vessel, saying, as&#xD;
he shook Captain Maxwell's hand:&#xD;
"Make haste back to Athens, for I am deter-&#xD;
mined to aid the Greeks, if I die on their classic&#xD;
soil. And the 'Dolphin' should retrieve her&#xD;
character by rendering them assistance, after hav-&#xD;

&#xD;
A muttered oath was the perplexed seaman's&#xD;
only reply; but, ere the noble owner was on&#xD;
board the other vessel, the " Dolphin's" anchor&#xD;
was at her bow, and her canvass unfurled. A&#xD;
moment more, and with braced yards she left&#xD;
the channel, with a prosperous breeze and a&#xD;
cloudless sky. The marble-crested heights of&#xD;
Paros soon fhded into the distance, and the "JDol.&#xD;
phin" once more rode upon the broad, blue&#xD;
breast of the M~gean sea, beneath the azure glow&#xD;
of the' Oriental sky. Then Elissa came forth&#xD;
again, and Alexis narrated a portion of what had&#xD;
transpired, although he felt that he was ignorant&#xD;
of the real position of her uncle. Of one thing&#xD;
he felt certain---she was innocent gf all crime,&#xD;

"Why return to Scio?" asked Alexis. .And&#xD;
then a vague suspicion about her uncle, gather-,&#xD;
ing likea mysterious shadow night around&#xD;
his thoughts, he continued:&#xD;
"Supposing we get paptain Max  e1 to turn&#xD;

Misunderstanding the purport of this remark,&#xD;
upon which her pure womanly pride put a con-&#xD;
struction that stifled, all, affection, Elissa throw&#xD;
off the encircling arm, and sprang to her feet.&#xD;
Happy Images, but a moment before, revelling&#xD;
in her affections, were scattered.like fairies be-&#xD;
fore an arch-enchanter's wand; her cheeks glow-&#xD;

"But lear, me? 1'-&#xD;
"Not a word)" ahe replied, in an imperative,&#xD;
&#xD;
tone; and retired into her state-room. .The bolt&#xD;
clinched in the 49pr-lock, and Alexis was alone.&#xD;
His fondest hopes were crushed; his pure .inten-&#xD;
tions cast back, daggled in the mire, of .suspi-&#xD;
cion; and the bitter stikgs, of disappointment&#xD;
rankled in his wounded heart. With a bent brow&#xD;
and a quivering lip, he ascended the companion-&#xD;
Way, and slowly.paved the deck.&#xD;
The'wind had not risen since the morning;&#xD;
bqit the sky paa gloomy, wbiile" the heaving of&#xD;
the cross-seas presaged a stormy night. Thick&#xD;
mngsses of cloud scudded across the, sky,. and a&#xD;
dense mist caie from the mountains of Attica,&#xD;
while the setting sun glowed like a half extin-&#xD;
guished furnace, All the light .*ls 'had; been&#xD;
sent down, and the lugger lay-to under storm-&#xD;
reefed mau-sails,with enough of her, jib\set to&#xD;
make her answer her helm.&#xD;
To Alexisehis -contest of the elements  as&#xD;
welcome, for the scene harmonized with his trou-&#xD;
bled. spirit. . Sopn came the storm, howling an-&#xD;
grily through the shrouds, while groaning tim-&#xD;
bera aptd flapping sails added to the wild uproar.&#xD;
The darkness increased, and the lugger was put&#xD;
before the wind-it was with diflculty that the&#xD;
man at the helm could, keep her there, as she&#xD;
was tossed over, the mountain-waves '&#xD;
The captain and crew were vigilant in their&#xD;
battle wih the elements, and no one thought of&#xD;
danger u til the carpenter came to the quarter-&#xD;
deck.&#xD;
"Captain Maxwell," said he, in a low tone,&#xD;
"thereis twofeet of rater in the well I"&#xD;
"Uig the pumps-I" shouted the captain through&#xD;
his trumpet, In tonesthat could be heard above&#xD;
the storm. "This straining, lets ,in the water;&#xD;
but bend on two.good gange to spelleach other,&#xD;
and theqboxes will soon rattle."&#xD;
The order-was obeyed, and the men pumped&#xD;
as though their Ifes were at stake, encouraged&#xD;
by the mate, who urged them with exciting cries.&#xD;
Half an hour passed, and the storm seemed to in-&#xD;
crease in fury, while the rain came: down in tor-&#xD;
rents.&#xD;
"Try the well, carpenter," daid the captain,&#xD;
coiningforward from the gare-deck.&#xD;
" Two feet,. three inches I" was soon the re-&#xD;
port, in a low ani deppairingtone.&#xD;

It was Miaulis, who had been to Syra before a&#xD;

an honorable excuse to got away from his guar,&#xD;

Captain Maxwell through his -trumpet, as thp&#xD;

Lavalette's heart sank again-forhehads&#xD;
pledged himself thai the young-man should res&#xD;

of his 10s. As if to add to his-sorrow, le sawa9&#xD;

Miaulis at once consented--for sailors, of ev-&#xD;
ery grade, take great pleasure in relieving 6ach&#xD;

rounded- the headland into the harbor. To the&#xD;
surprise of all, excepting the Greek commander,&#xD;
the Turkish crescent-flag no longer floated from&#xD;

first victory. Greece will yet bi free I"&#xD;
His hardy crew took up the words, and their&#xD;
eyes'glistened with joy, as they shouted:&#xD;
"G reece will yet be free I"&#xD;
Captain Maxwell no sooner was (ofbrmed of&#xD;
this change of masters, than he fired 'a regular&#xD;
salute - and, when the vessels reached the quay,&#xD;
the whole population, flushed with joy, came to&#xD;
welcome Miaulis. The "Dolphin" was taken&#xD;
;o a spot where she could be examined at low&#xD;

but he had no idea that it would ripen so soon,&#xD;
nd he now found himself in the position of a&#xD;
miner, who sees the distant end of his train ig'&#xD;

?rossed hi intention of going with Elissa to his&#xD;

Refusal or opposition was out of the question,&#xD;

IMPERIAL   CONSTANTINOPLE!     Surrounded&#xD;
by what is uest enchanting in nature ; adorned&#xD;
with what is most interesting in art ; hallowed&#xD;
by traditions, of unequalled historical interest;&#xD;
she sits in peeress majesty upon-her eceat-laved&#xD;
throne.. - Queen of cities, she has -in turn upheld&#xD;
the Barbarian, the Christian, and the Moslem&#xD;
rule; and now, in' the fifteenth century of her&#xD;
glory, her seven hills support the very personi-&#xD;
fication of Oriental despotism. From the taper-&#xD;
ing minarets, where Constantine first unfurled&#xD;
the banner of: the cross,' is now hourly heard the&#xD;
impressive cry' of the iifidels "There is but&#xD;
one God, sad Mahomet is his prophet"  Where&#xD;
vestals-oace trimmed the ever-burning lamps on&#xD;
heathen- shrines, -gilded domes rise mysteriously-&#xD;
from thick groves,-fit nests for eureffally-guarded,&#xD;
Circassian birds of beautf. The blood-stained&#xD;
battlements of the Seven-Towers have resisted&#xD;
the gnawing tooth of time, and- the old vall yet&#xD;
girdles  the city like a crest of glory, its massive&#xD;
height reflected in the glassy mirror of the deep-,--&#xD;
that grave of mayriads who have dared to love.&#xD;
Far away stretches the Bosphorus, its blue tide&#xD;
dividing the shadowy mountain slopes of Europe&#xD;
and of Asia, clothed to the water-sides with for-&#xD;
ests, palaces, gardens and fortresses. Opposite&#xD;
is Scutari, rich in barracks and in burial-grounds,&#xD;
behind which the dim Blue Mountains extend in&#xD;
&#xD;
an undulating lie!; and, at times, the vision of&#xD;
Mounrt Olympus is unfolded,- its icy summit&#xD;
blending with the clear blue -sky. Neither must&#xD;
Pera be forgotten) eloquent with diplomatic resi-&#xD;
deuces; or' Galata, redolent of commeteil'&#xD;
,wealth; or the Golden Horn) 'dappled with  its&#xD;
ever-varying fleet. And over 'everythulig-'on&#xD;
land and on the water-there hangs a shadowy&#xD;
'veil of mysticism,.-wenbhanting,'yet awful,-.that&#xD;
can but make the scene one of intense interest,&#xD;
The expanding mind plunges deep into the   trl&#xD;
ditiens that invest every dome and miiaret, ev-&#xD;
ery palace and tower. Generation after genera-&#xD;
tion, creed after creed, sweep rapidly past upon&#xD;
the track of memory, but the back-groind is eVdr&#xD;
the same. Refined magnificence, rude power,&#xD;
And bigoted cruelty, fuirnish their rapid illustra-&#xD;
tions to each change that fancy pictures) in con,&#xD;
juring up past periodsof splendor, chivalry and&#xD;
barbarism, Ages, dark and bright, are before&#xD;
us. The thirsty imagination drinks in the broad&#xD;
stream of history, or pierces for some hidden&#xD;
spring of romance that bubbles forth on the&#xD;
shores of the Propontis.&#xD;
The seraglio occupies the very focus of' this&#xD;
enchanting scene, rising, like a dream, upon the&#xD;
extreme point of the peninsula, which stretches&#xD;
boldly oflt into the silvery tide. Ii is a confused&#xD;
mass of buildings, clustered together likea bunh&#xD;

THE RUSSIAN GUARDSMAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
uttered that an automaton might have uttered&#xD;
it; neither did she even raise her eyes.&#xD;
"Sultana," said the guardian, "here is a pe-&#xD;
tition from an infidel, in the slave-market, to&#xD;
our mighty lord, Mahmoud. He bade me hand&#xD;
it to you, and announce his visit."  ,&#xD;
Zalallah appeared neither to hearnor to heed&#xD;
the message, and the guardian stood, holding a&#xD;
folded paper. All at once, as if awakening from&#xD;
a trance, she took the petition, and the slave&#xD;
withdrew. It was directed in a coarse hind to&#xD;
the sultan; nor was it without a feeling of dis-&#xD;
gust that she opened the greasy folds. But no&#xD;
sooner did she peruse the first line than-with&#xD;
eager eyes she devoured the remainder. A rav-&#xD;
enous appetite for news of her lost daughter&#xD;
gave her a mental gluttony, as she repad&#xD;
read these few words:&#xD;
"Mzwr SULTAN :-Alexis Orloff, a major&#xD;

"Orloff," repeated the sultana, "Orofft It is&#xD;

ces give their daughters."-&#xD;
,"-Noblest, best of sovereigns-ay, of men I"&#xD;
-exclaimed the delighted sultana. "For me you&#xD;
have broken through ,all the trammels of cus-&#xD;
tom; all the prejudices of your creed; and now&#xD;
you seek to fill my cup of happiness to the brim."&#xD;
"Nay, the obligation.is mine. Not only have&#xD;

you have displayed an interest in my prosperity&#xD;
which has had the appearance of sincerity-a&#xD;

more of this now, though, for I know you are all&#xD;

than hedipped his hands thrice. A guardian&#xD;

tain their independence by erecting fortifications&#xD;
they abandoned themselves to pleasure. No oth-&#xD;
or modern nation possesses such volatility and&#xD;
buoyancy of spirits-traits of characters which,&#xD;
perhaps, alone kept -them from  self-destructjon&#xD;
during their long oppression. The same feeling&#xD;
--if we may believe those who know them best-&#xD;
never reigns long at a time -in the bosom of-a&#xD;
modern Greek. Sadness will vanish in a mo-&#xD;
ment, and the most melancholy events leave but&#xD;
a transitory impression-on the mercurial surface&#xD;
of their temperament, which is no sooner ruffled&#xD;
by some external movement than it smothers&#xD;
itself by its own elasticity. Tears with them are&#xD;
but the dewdrops that form the rainbow of hope&#xD;
when struck by the after sunshine of smiling&#xD;
gayety; and now that the veil of Moslem terror&#xD;
was momentarily drawn away, all 4 _d4ne&#xD;

their prey was'quietly slumbering within range&#xD;
of the squadron's heavy battery, little dreaming&#xD;
of the sad fate that frowned over them.. Elissa,&#xD;

T   n flight of Alel froin the pavilion hatu-&#xD;
raly roused a great. excitement in the seraglio.&#xD;
Never before had an Intruder escaped alive; and&#xD;
the whole community resembled a swarm of&#xD;
bees, whose sanctuary had been invaded by some&#xD;
mischievous boy. The guardians, with drawn&#xD;
yataghans, rushed franticallyabout, calling oiA&#xD;
the odalisques to retire into their-sleeping.rooms,&#xD;
a comman4 which the fair ones had no idea of&#xD;
obeying until they had learned all the particu-&#xD;
lars. Alarm gongs werevounded, and such Was&#xD;
the uproar that it reached the ears of Sultan&#xD;
Mahmoud, who was seated at his council-board,&#xD;
deliberating on the intentions of Rtussia.,&#xD;
Step by step the autocrat had advanced, adopt.&#xD;
ing,ar intervals, therivers Dnieper, Bege, Dneis'.&#xD;
tAr and ruth as a frontier line, and now he&#xD;
would fain advance his custom4iouses to the&#xD;
yery month ofthe-Danube. The Turks expect-&#xD;
ed tosee their capital spin surmounted'by the&#xD;
Greek eross; but theT wished to keep offi-4or&#xD;
another century, if fate would permit-the fatal&#xD;
day when the prophecies would be fulfilled, For,&#xD;
before the contests of the fiery Catherini, the&#xD;
Inhabitants of Constantinople pointed At the&#xD;
patieular gate by which the Muscovite troops&#xD;
wld eeeinnly enter the City of Promise; and&#xD;
they carried their 4ead across into Asiapa--f&#xD;
&#xD;
their prophets had proclaimed that the Moslem&#xD;
was bat encamped in Europe. Yet Sultan Mah-&#xD;
moud hoped that the evil day would not come&#xD;
within his reign, and had summoned his chiet&#xD;
officers around the divan of council to consider&#xD;
what course should be pursued if the Russians&#xD;
should aid the Greeks in their revolution. There&#xD;
was also some cause for apprehension in the&#xD;
visit of the "Nicolai," althongh he had not dared&#xD;
to refuse her a passage through the jealously-&#xD;
guarded straits of the Dardenelles.&#xD;
Thetumult in the adacent seraglio interrupted&#xD;
the deliberations, and the guardian, who had in.&#xD;
troduced -Alexis, appeared at the door with a&#xD;
troubled look,Imaking a sign tQ the sultan.&#xD;
Mahpnoud, requesting the Seraskier Pacha to&#xD;
preside, left the divan, and learning from the&#xD;
trembling guardian the cause of the uproar, he&#xD;
immediately hurried to the pavilion.&#xD;
Zulalah, almost paralyzed with astonishnt&#xD;
at the unexpected conduct of Alexis, remained&#xD;
where he had left her, gaaing earnestly at the&#xD;
vessel; but ere he was &amp;amp;rly on the deck she&#xD;
was surrounded by a score of guardians, with&#xD;
drawn yataghans. Then came one clad in ted,&#xD;

-"_Yes. Tell me-were you able to escape-?"&#xD;
"Alas! I know nothing of Elissa. I was&#xD;
brought here by force, imprisoned,-nd have been&#xD;
nearly-starved to death since my j4 'Ior perished.&#xD;
Why did you not send a guard to the country-&#xD;
house ?"&#xD;
"Why did I not ?" repeated the bey. "Was&#xD;
it not your duty to watch over her? Did I oot&#xD;
save you from a felon's death, in order to have&#xD;

my doomed enemyras a reward? And were-not&#xD;
you to watch over Elissa, the daughter of her&#xD;

ple-an advancement which has enabled me. to&#xD;
wipe out one long account? Truly have I a&#xD;
mind to add you to the list of victims, and thus&#xD;
end your caieer of crime "&#xD;
His majestic figure dilated as he thundered&#xD;
forth these questions, in tones that penetrated&#xD;
the very soul of the guilty partner in his schemes,&#xD;
and there was no reply. After a short pause,&#xD;
he continued :'&#xD;
4A You do not speak, cowardly slave! Mark,&#xD;

he wished that he had been left to starve in his&#xD;
prison-cell.  Then hope, that arch-comforter,&#xD;
whispered that Elissa might be among those&#xD;
who had gained hiding-places in the mountains.&#xD;
Inspired by the idea, he determined to con~mence&#xD;
a search, when a Turkish soldier approached&#xD;
him, saying:&#xD;
"Do you wish to purchase a ring ?"&#xD;
Lavalette, as he gazed on the jewel offered&#xD;
him, felt his limbs totter; and his breath became&#xD;
short and thick.&#xD;
It was a ring, which Zalallali had sent from&#xD;
Constantinople to be given to Elissa on her last&#xD;
birthday, and a portion of the golden circlet was&#xD;
encrusted with blood.&#xD;
"1Where," te at length nerved himself to ask,&#xD;
"did you obtain this ?"          -&#xD;
"From the finger of a dead girl, just out of&#xD;
town," replied the soldier, with a demoniac&#xD;
smile. "I had to use the knife to get it, for the&#xD;
finger was somewhat swollen; but it had to come.&#xD;
Do you wish it?"               .'&#xD;
Giving the soldier a few piastres, which amply&#xD;
satisfied him, Lavalette put the ring in his pock-&#xD;
et, and for some time paced the streets, lost in&#xD;
5&#xD;
&#xD;
thought. He felt that, unless he contrivedome&#xD;
blan of escape, his life would .be forfeited-that,&#xD;
poo, when he,had a fortune safely dpped in&#xD;
Yienna, the fruit f his long -service 9f villapy&#xD;
with Consul Orloff.&#xD;
Unconsciously he had approached .thequey,&#xD;
where a boat from one of the Turkijh; frigates&#xD;
was waiting. The coxswain - was -a   g&#xD;
I ~I ,epde&#xD;
Frenchman, who for some years had epta ail-&#xD;
boat at Smyrna, for the amusementf theFuro-&#xD;
pean residents, and Lavalette had seversltimes&#xD;
gone out with him. To his great joy; the=an&#xD;
recgnized him.&#xD;
" Ah 1" said he, "are you here? -knew that&#xD;
you had something to do with that lqqdthirsty&#xD;
Osmar Bey, but, I didn't -know you'd come here&#xD;
with him. But we shall-soon be away."&#xD;
"Do you sail soon ?" asked Lavalette, with as&#xD;
much unconcern as he could assume.&#xD;
"The ship's at single anchor, and we are wait-&#xD;
ing for an officer, who is to carry despatches to&#xD;
Constantinople. It is that reckless Parisian,&#xD;
Hilaire, who is a sort of aid-de-camp to this&#xD;
Osmar."&#xD;
"I know it," said Lavalette ; "and here he&#xD;
comes'." Then advancing towards a young man,&#xD;
in a Turkish uniform, whose countenance was&#xD;
strongly marked with traces of dissipation, he&#xD;
exclaimed :&#xD;
"dWell, my dear Hilaire, I was afraid I should&#xD;
have to go without you."&#xD;
"Go without me !" repeated the astonished&#xD;
young man.&#xD;
"'Yes. The bey gave me my orders last&#xD;
night, and I feared that I should have a blue&#xD;
time of it until he told ine you were to carry the&#xD;
official account of the battle. You will say when&#xD;
I take you to see some of my Armenian lady-&#xD;
friends, in Tophana, that I know Constantino-&#xD;
ple; but it is dull music alone."&#xD;
- Hilaire was completely deceived. He had&#xD;
been at Lavalette's house with his commander,&#xD;
and knew that they had intimate relations-nor&#xD;
had he any suspicions that all was not as the wily&#xD;
clerk stated. So he expressed great delight at&#xD;
having the pleasure of his company, and in a&#xD;
few moments the boat was on its way to the&#xD;
Turkish frigate, the well-feathered oars beating&#xD;
the blue water into glistening spray.&#xD;
Hilaire introduced Lavalette to the captain,-&#xD;
who was likewise a Frenchman,-and a fellow-&#xD;
passenger; and in a few moments the almost&#xD;
breathless fugitive heard the welcome notes of&#xD;
the boatswain's whistle, followed by the call:&#xD;

no reliance could b placed in contest or storm.&#xD;
Never had Lavalette, in his long career of&#xD;
crime, felt so relieved as when he saw the island&#xD;
of Scio fade into the distance. He joined his&#xD;
companion in revelry until late at night, recall-&#xD;
ing the conquests- and glories of France over&#xD;
ruby wine from'her sunny slopes, and quite in-&#xD;
gratiating himself with the officers.&#xD;
The next morning, when they were washing&#xD;
the decks overhead, Hilaire lay in a drunken&#xD;
sleep; but the wily partner of his state-room was&#xD;
up, and opening -the bag which ,contained his&#xD;
despatches, had abstracted a letter to Zalallah.&#xD;
Carefully putting it in one of his pockets, he&#xD;
then retired to rest, and it was difficult to arouse&#xD;
him for the late breakfast.&#xD;

stains of her rebellion! The arms of the sultan&#xD;
have triumphed,, and his army is invincible!&#xD;
Glory, to the  ost High for the success of the&#xD;

'To the Turks this announcement was, the sig-&#xD;
nal for 'illuminations and rejoicings-while their&#xD;
Greek neighbors, trembling for their own safety,&#xD;
felt bound to join in the festivities, ay, to rejoice&#xD;
over the massacre of their relatives. Their&#xD;
hopes of seeing the Greek cross replace the cres-&#xD;
cent over Saint Sophia vanished like a dream,&#xD;
and their hearts sank, surrounded like Marius,&#xD;
by the ruins of their projects. Now their eyes&#xD;
must be directed towards the barbarians of the&#xD;
North. Russia, having succeeded in other en-&#xD;
terprises of aggrandizement, -must pursue her&#xD;
career of ambition, and the Muscovites must&#xD;
drive back the Ottomans into Asia. That this&#xD;
mission might be accomplished has been the&#xD;
daily prayer of thousands since that sad night&#xD;
when Captain Hilaire brought news of the mas-&#xD;
sacre of Scio to Sultan Mahmoud. But one,&#xD;
deeply interested in the intelligence, knew not&#xD;
of its arrival. Fearing the worst, Zalallah sat in&#xD;
her prison palace, with her head resting on her&#xD;
hands, as one who had endured some torturing&#xD;
pain, that left its traces behind., The mournful&#xD;
expression that furrowed her pale face, and the&#xD;
melancholy languor floating in' crimson dashes&#xD;
over her large 'eyes, told that her thoughts were&#xD;
far -away in a world of her 'owri sad creation.&#xD;
She heard the salutes, but they made no impres-&#xD;
sion upon her mind, - pre-occupied as it was with&#xD;
other thoughts. In former days she had looked&#xD;
at life through the magnifying telescope of hope&#xD;
-but now despair, reversing the lenses;,even-&#xD;
diminished the feeble chances of seeingher daugh-&#xD;
ter again. Could she have brought herself t6&#xD;
think that Elissa was alive, it would have been&#xD;
different-but a sad presentiment that she, had&#xD;
bn slain at Scio saddened her every moment.&#xD;
The dark waters of eternity rolled between her&#xD;
and the loved one jwho was to be her companion&#xD;
in that ideal home to which she had looked for&#xD;
years The well-known footsteps of the sultan&#xD;
aroused her, and she rosd to greet him.. But so&#xD;
cold was the hand she extended, and such vivid&#xD;
anxiety was depicted upon her wan countenance,&#xD;
that he involuntarily shuddered.,&#xD;
' Ah" she exclaimed, mistaking the' cause&#xD;
of his emotion, "you haye evil tidings forme !"&#xD;
"No," he replied. 1'"On the contrary she is&#xD;
safe and well. Osmar Bey has conquered the&#xD;
Sciotes, and has washed out the stain of their&#xD;
&#xD;
insurrection with a tide of blood. But he has&#xD;
sent Lavalette here, to assure you that Elia is&#xD;
well, and he brings yon a ring, which he says&#xD;
you will recognize, as a token of her welfare "&#xD;
" Thank.God I" fervently ejaculated Zalallah.&#xD;
"I am truly undeserving such mercy."&#xD;
"Nay, nay," said the sultan, "you merit ev-&#xD;
erything. Listen, Zalallah, for I have an ag-&#xD;
nouncement to make that fills my heart with an-&#xD;
guish. For years you have been my favorite&#xD;
sultana, my friendly adviser. But, owing.to the&#xD;
unfortunate intervie* with that young Russian,&#xD;
the seraglio must be closed against-you. To have&#xD;
a sultana who had conversed with another man,&#xD;
would be virtually abdicating my throne, and&#xD;
never would be pardoned by the stern Moslems.&#xD;
Already the Ulemas of the mosque of Sultan&#xD;
Achmet have sent a deputation to agk if youi&#xD;
had suffered the penalty of your crime! What&#xD;
can I do ?"&#xD;
" Generous Mahmoud," interrupted Zalallah,&#xD;
"I will not cause you trouble, for my poor life&#xD;
is:- "&#xD;
"Your life is precious to me, and to your&#xD;
daughter. Listen, I would not send you hence&#xD;
did I not think that you could be made happier.&#xD;
But I well know that yoa have ever looked for-&#xD;
ward to a union with your daughter, and now-&#xD;
the opportunity offers. Tomorrow night you wil&#xD;
be conducted to a caique, which will convey you&#xD;
to a fast-sailing schooner. Lavalette will be on&#xD;
board, and I shall place wealth :enough in his&#xD;
hands to make your lot an easy one. Now, Zn-&#xD;
lallah, we must part !"&#xD;
Long after the sultan had left, Zalallah re-&#xD;
mained standing motionless, confused by the&#xD;
overflowing of joy from long-sealed fountains.&#xD;
Could it be possible that she was to clasp her&#xD;
'long-deserted child to her heart, craving pardon&#xD;
for her desertion, and telling her long, pent-up&#xD;
love. Then to think that she was .to live with&#xD;
her child-to see her in the morning, and to re-&#xD;
ceive her haste kiss at night! What happiness'!&#xD;
The walls of her prison no longer confined her&#xD;
winged spirit-it had taken its flight, and the&#xD;
soft magic of hope had not only brightened thb&#xD;
future, but seized upon the present, and bits&#xD;
all-powerful prism changed the aspect of every-&#xD;
thing around. Tranquil content again beamed&#xD;
'from her countenance, and, like the sparkling&#xD;
flow of afountain, proclaimed that all was bright'&#xD;
and clear within. It was late ere she retired to&#xD;
rest, and then, in dreams, she anticipated a joy-&#xD;
ful meeting with her daughter.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE RUSSIAN (&#xD;
&#xD;
The next day she was busy in preparing her&#xD;
effects, which had been sent to her from the se-&#xD;
raglio, and which were now conveyed by a trusty&#xD;
messenger on board the "Stamboul."  This was&#xD;
a schooner-yltcht-built in- England-of about&#xD;
two hundred and fifty tons burthen. She carried&#xD;
six guns, besides a long twenty-four pounder.&#xD;
amidships, and was commanded by an honest&#xD;
Scotchman, Captain Stewart, who had for years&#xD;
served as master-mate in the* English navy-&#xD;
which he left for better pay and promotion in the&#xD;
sultan's service. His crew consisted of twenty-&#xD;
four Englishmen, all told, with eight young,&#xD;
Turkish midshipmen, sent to learn the rudiments&#xD;
of ,eamanship. The present voyage (so his or-,&#xD;
ders stated) was for the purpose of carrying&#xD;
Monsieur Lavalette and a lady. to Scio, and&#xD;
thence to Malta, or any other port his passengers&#xD;
might select.&#xD;
Night at length came, and dreary it was.&#xD;
Black clouds obscured the moon, and it was sel-&#xD;
dom that a star could pee'p forth, while shrill,&#xD;
gusts of wind came sweeping down the Bospho-&#xD;
rus. At length Lavalette came, and, with all his&#xD;
talent at dissimulation, Zalallah could but regard'&#xD;
him with distrust, so guilty was the expression'&#xD;
of his downcast eyes. But when he gave her&#xD;
the well-known ring as a pledge that her daugh-.&#xD;
ter was safe, and recounted many anecdotes&#xD;
about her, the credulous mother was completely&#xD;
deceived. High did her heart beat with hope as&#xD;
she followed him from her unguarded prison,&#xD;
and thence through the narrow, unlighted streets&#xD;
to the fish-market landing. There a caique was&#xD;
in waiting; and soon the sultana, from the deck&#xD;
of the "Stamboul," gazed upon the seraglio,&#xD;
so long her home, for the last time.&#xD;
The anchor was soon at the cat-head, and sail&#xD;
after sail was set. No sooner did the clouds of&#xD;
canvass thus unfolded catch the wind, than the&#xD;
tall, raking masts bent before the pressure, and&#xD;
the "Stamboul " gleamed merrily over the spark-&#xD;
ling waves. Running freely before a steady ten-&#xD;
knot breeze, with the current in her favor, she&#xD;
sped on her way rather too rapidly for Lavalette,&#xD;
who had not yet matured his schemes of villany.&#xD;
Once he was tempted to throw Zalallah over-&#xD;
board; but a moment's reflection convinced him&#xD;
that Captain Stewart would deal out justice with&#xD;
an inflexible hand. No-he must hatch up some&#xD;
cunning plan by which to get rid of her, and&#xD;
then escape to the continent.&#xD;
Gallantly did the "Stamboul" speed on her&#xD;
course the first two days; but no sooner had she&#xD;
&#xD;
GUARDSMAN.                             75&#xD;
cleared the Dardanelles, than the wind forsook&#xD;
her canvass, which now hung idly flapping a.out,&#xD;
like sheets upon a clothes-line. Hour after hour&#xD;
did the "Stamboul " idly ride over the long--&#xD;
heaving waves, exposed to the full glare of the&#xD;
sun. To Zalallah, each hour passed drearily;&#xD;
but Lavalette was in high spirits, for he had at&#xD;
last matured his-plan. It was this Oi errting&#xD;
at Scio, he would land with Zalallah at a part of&#xD;
the town remote from the citadel-then, ea'ving&#xD;
her under some pretext, he would hastn on&#xD;
board the "Stamboul" again, and direct her&#xD;
course to Malta. Of course, Captain Sewart&#xD;
would not object to this; and from  al16, he&#xD;
could easily get to Italy. Then, hastening to&#xD;
Vienna, he could revel in his ill-gotten poil.&#xD;
At length the desired breeze came, playing&#xD;
aloft coquettishly ere it blew steadily, although&#xD;
not from the desired quarter; and again 41d the&#xD;
staunch "Stamboul'" lean over gracefullyas she&#xD;
sped through the waves. Then came th stoIrm.&#xD;
Light sails were taken in, and soon, with reefed&#xD;
caivass, she dashed the waters from her bows in&#xD;
sheets of foam. Heavy clouds hung like funeral-&#xD;
palls overhead, and, as the wind chanted its&#xD;
dirge-like melody through the rigging, the wild&#xD;
waves echoed back the sound with sullen echo.&#xD;
But- wild as was the storm without, there was&#xD;
calmness in the thoughts of Zalallah-for she&#xD;
thought that the tempestuous winds were hurry-&#xD;
ing her towards her child. Black as Wias the&#xD;
night, it was less dark than were the thoughts of&#xD;
Lavalette.&#xD;
Gradually the storm died away, And when the&#xD;
morning sun rose there was no trace of 'coimo-&#xD;
tion in the quiet heavens. A gentle breeze just&#xD;
swelled the sails, and the crew of the""'$tam-&#xD;
boul," fatigued with their night's toil, lay sleep-&#xD;
ing on her deck, with the exception of lhie"man&#xD;
at the helm and the lookout. The eaptai was&#xD;
in his state-room dreaming of the "banks and&#xD;
braes o' bonnie Doon," and the mate, lase&#xD;
watch it was, paced slowly to and fre'on the&#xD;
quarter-deck.&#xD;
The shadows were cast straight down"upon&#xD;
the snowy deck ere the captain came ip the&#xD;
companion-way. Walking to the main-rigging,&#xD;
he scanned the horizon, where some dark specks&#xD;
attracted his attention; and he roused a sleeping&#xD;
boy, with an order to bring his glass.&#xD;
" The Greek fleet 1" he exclaimed, after a long&#xD;
look; "and they have the weather-gage of us at&#xD;

Alexis could but think of Elissa; and he al-&#xD;
most hoped that she had perished in the "Dol-&#xD;
phin," rather than have landed to fall a victim&#xD;
to the Turks. Neither was Captain Paskewitsch&#xD;
less a prey to thought, as he went ashore with&#xD;
his two passengers -for he could but feel indig-&#xD;
nant at the sight of such wholesale devastation.&#xD;
Landing at the quay, they walked into the now&#xD;
desolate market-place; and there the consul was&#xD;
accosted by a wounded old man, clad in misera-&#xD;
ble rags:&#xD;
"Alas ! Orloff, you are the cause of all our&#xD;
desolation I"&#xD;
"II" exclaimed the ruined merchant.. Then,&#xD;
with a thrill of horror, he recognized in -the&#xD;
wretched object before him, Kalerdji, whom he&#xD;
had long known as one of the most prosperous&#xD;
Sciotes.&#xD;
"1Yes !-you are the cause of it all. Remem-&#xD;
ber you the young Frenchman who came here,&#xD;
years ago, and married your daughter, so niuch&#xD;
against your will? Little thought we, when at&#xD;
your request we refused to give him employment&#xD;
in our counting-houses, that we were sowing&#xD;
grains of vengeance to spring up in after years&#xD;
so powerful as to ruin us by their poisonous&#xD;
shade. We forgot it-he remembered itI And&#xD;
we know, alas! that all this misery is but a re-&#xD;
payal of the debt of revenge, contracted by us,&#xD;
Orloff, at your request !"&#xD;
"Wiat I" eagerly inquired the consul, hor-&#xD;
ror-strickeg at the presentiment, "is the com-&#xD;
mender-"&#xD;
He could not conclude the sentence, so pow-&#xD;
eril were his emotions; but Kalerdji finished it&#xD;
for him :&#xD;
"Osmar Bey, Orloff, is the husband of your&#xD;
daughter-the father of her child ! If you seek&#xD;
his work, look around I"&#xD;
"Heavens 1" said Alexis. "Osmar Bey, then,&#xD;
is my father ?"&#xD;
"Even so, young man, if you are Orloff's&#xD;
grandson; and let me advise you to be off. We&#xD;
have felt the claws of the lion, and have no love&#xD;
for the whelps)"&#xD;
Qbme," said Captain raskewitsAh, "let us&#xD;
athe 'Nicolai,'"&#xD;
A crowd o fdesperate-looking beings were be-&#xD;
ginning to collect,, and they regarded Alexis with&#xD;
ferocious looks, as if thirsting for his blood. No&#xD;
demonstration was made, however, and before&#xD;
an hour hadI elapsed, the "Nicolai'' was agaisp&#xD;
underweigh. .&#xD;
The consul,.on reaching the vessel, had retired&#xD;
&#xD;
GUARDSMAN.O&#xD;
&#xD;
to his state-room, as if anxious to escape the&#xD;
curious gaze of the officers. Alexis followed&#xD;
him, a deep flush of shame glowing on his cheek&#xD;
-for he felt that his father was not only a rene-&#xD;
gade, but that, instigated by a diabolical ven-&#xD;
geance, he had planned the ruin of his grand-&#xD;
father. A solution of the mystery of his parent-&#xD;
age had ever been one of his darling wishes;&#xD;
but he now found himself the son of a revenge-&#xD;
ful outlaw, whose bloody deeds made him hang-&#xD;
his head in very shame, while his bright eye-&#xD;
was fixed sightless on the floor. Then, before&#xD;
either broke silence, it occurred to him that there&#xD;
might be some mistake-some terrible error.&#xD;
Osmar Bey was a soldier, who would scorn to&#xD;
cherish a foul passion, but might have ravaged&#xD;
SCe in qbedience to inexorable orders. So chi-&#xD;
Vairous a Inan, educated (as Achmet had in-&#xD;
formed him, when on their way to the camp, near&#xD;
Smyrna) in the army of Napoleon, must be in-&#xD;
capable of treachery.&#xD;
" Grandfather,'' said he, "an awful veil has&#xD;
been removed from my eyes."&#xD;
"And from   my own," ,interrupted the old&#xD;
man. "Little did I imagine when I saw that&#xD;
renegade at Lavalette's, that he was the destroyer&#xD;
of your mother's happiness, linked with other&#xD;
villains to ruin me-to beggar you."&#xD;
"But may there not be some error?- At any&#xD;
rate, let me find him, and then, face to face, as-&#xD;
certain the truth. Surely, did he know that I&#xD;
am his son, he would love rather than hate you,&#xD;
for the love you have borne me. I must-r-I will&#xD;
see him I"&#xD;
Rising from hrs seat, Alexis paced the narrow&#xD;
state-room, a prey to violent emotion.&#xD;
"Nay, Alexis, do not couple your name with&#xD;
that of such a wretch, who has despoiled me of&#xD;
my fortune as he despoiled me of my daughter,&#xD;
and made my name a prey to the hissing tongues&#xD;
of merchants 'far and wide."&#xD;
"But I must know this ; for long, long years&#xD;
have I desired to see my father-to speak with&#xD;
him-and now, 0. how much have. I to say.&#xD;
Farewell, dear grandfather! I hope to meet you&#xD;
soon after your arrival at Malta, and perchance&#xD;
I may clear up this mystery.",&#xD;
Before the consul could reply, Alexis had left&#xD;
the cabin, and was in consultation with Captain&#xD;
Paskewitsch. His orders were to visit Greece,&#xD;
and now his inclinations led him there. No ar-&#xD;
guments would keep him; and he left in a&#xD;
small felucca, hired in the harbor, just as the&#xD;
frigate spread her clouds of canvass to the breeze.&#xD;

madness 'to attempt to gain an offing; and the&#xD;
captain, with compressed lips, fearlessly ranbe-'&#xD;
fore the wind to annihilation or to'safety.,&#xD;
On-on-on the felucca drove, tnitil thete rose&#xD;
before her a high precipice, fringed at its base&#xD;
by a foaming barrier of surf. Yet in this appar-&#xD;
ently continuous headland, there is-as the mas-&#xD;
ter of the felucca well knew-a narrow indenta-&#xD;
tion, forming a bay, at the extremity of which a&#xD;
brook emptied its waters, bringing down a san4y&#xD;
deposit that forms a fine beach. For this haven&#xD;
the Greek had shaped the course of his tight&#xD;
little craft, and there was an exclamation of&#xD;
thankfulness from each one on board, as she en-&#xD;
terpd the rocky portals in safety. A moment&#xD;
more, and her sharp keel ploughed the sand,&#xD;
while. the foam crested wave broke over her in&#xD;
an avalanche of snowy spray. Another came,&#xD;
towering and curling as it approached, and lift-&#xD;
ing her high up, deposited her far up the beach.&#xD;
They were on the Isthmus of Corinth, near a&#xD;
fortification just erected by the Greeks, where&#xD;
Alexis was warmly greeted, when he introduced&#xD;
himself in the morning. Changing his attire,&#xD;
he joined the officers at their breakfast, and found&#xD;
that as the Greeks depended upon the aid of the&#xD;
emperor, as head of their church, he was very&#xD;
welcome. But ere he could declare his wish to&#xD;
see the Turkish general, one of them spoke of&#xD;
their English allies, as then affording them great&#xD;
assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Yes," said another, "when I left Missolon-&#xD;
ghi, last week; English guns and English gold&#xD;
.were seen on all sides-although the Suliotes&#xD;
threw Away the' bayonets. Indeed, I think that&#xD;
Lord Byron would have captured Lepanto ere&#xD;
this, had'not his yacht arrived, bringing a young&#xD;
Smyrniote, just escaped from the massacre at&#xD;
Scio."&#xD;
Alexis started. Composing himself, 'he in-&#xD;
quired:&#xD;
"What is'the name of his lordship's yacht "&#xD;
"'The 'Dolphin.'- She has suffered some in a&#xD;
gale this winter, bat rode it out staunchly."&#xD;
"And this faith lidy's name ?"&#xD;
"I did not learn it., She is the hiece of some&#xD;
runaway merchant at Smyrna, and, is said to be&#xD;
very beautiful.. Next week I shall join him, with&#xD;
some of our mountaineers, and then for a fair&#xD;
fight with these turbaned doggy "&#xD;
- " You go back to Missolonghi, then ?" in-&#xD;
quired Alexis.              41'&#xD;
"I start this very day, with fifty Albanians.&#xD;
Will you not join us'? Rest assured that you&#xD;
can find materials for a fine report there-one&#xD;
which. may -induce your emperor to send us a&#xD;
squadron of Hungarian hussars, and a horde of&#xD;
Cossacks."&#xD;
"Thanks," replied Alexis, "I will go with&#xD;
you."&#xD;
Military men lose no time in coming to con-&#xD;
clusions, and before he had a moment for calm&#xD;
reflection, the bugle sounded, and his new com-&#xD;
rade called him. That night, fatigued with the&#xD;
march, coming as it did after the perilous voy-&#xD;
age, Alexis slept among the ruins of Platea,&#xD;
without even dreaming of his troubles.&#xD;
At early dawn they were again on.the march,&#xD;
and Alexis soon saw the secret of his compan-&#xD;
ion's ascendency-over his wild corps-so differ-&#xD;
ent from the Russian service. There, an officer&#xD;
was above his men, treating them like slaves;&#xD;
but the Greek captain was the very life of his&#xD;
band, winning their affections with kindness,, a&#xD;
fund of anecdote, and a ceaseless flow of spirits.&#xD;
It was his cheerful voice that roused them from&#xD;
their slumbers; it was he who ever led theway&#xD;
through dangerous passes ; his never-ceasing&#xD;
song cheered the weary march ; neither was his&#xD;
pleasant look and restless eye ever darkened by-&#xD;
fatigue.&#xD;
To Alexis, who had been taught to believe&#xD;
that troops must march in battle array, there was&#xD;
something as joyous as it was novel in this rapid,&#xD;
unceremonious passage among the wild scenery&#xD;

the equipment of the Greek, sQldiers. On they&#xD;
marched, between lofty . snow-clad cliffs, or&#xD;
across fertile plains, with no music but their o-,&#xD;
songs, no' baggage bt:t what eih man carried..&#xD;
The small white-cross banner flattered over&#xD;
their heads ; the soil of Greece was beneath their&#xD;
feet; and Alexis was so carried away by their&#xD;
enthusiasm that he forgot his own personal sor-&#xD;
rows. Greece, enslaved Greece, must again be&#xD;

irons were reglacedby plaited strips of sail-cloth,&#xD;
and he was -removed 'to an empty state room on'&#xD;
the gun-deck.&#xD;
He'was mad! 'At times, with an expression&#xD;
of hatred on his haggard countenance, he would&#xD;
shock even his sailor guardians by the blasphemy&#xD;
and freedom of his speech. Then, with a des-&#xD;
pairing voice, he would call for Elissa, and the,&#xD;
next moment, with an expression of deep can-&#xD;
ning, he would narrate his early deeds of einie.'&#xD;
But Manasseh Appeared to-be his greatest object&#xD;
of terror. 'He would kneel to him,' pray to him,&#xD;
entreat him in the workings of his phrenzy; andi&#xD;
his imploring voice echoed through the frigate&#xD;
long after night had set her sentinel stars in the&#xD;
firmament above.-&#xD;
The consul, when persuaded that the poor fel-&#xD;
low was' bereft of reason, felt that his re, ent&#xD;
hopes of a restoration of his property were blast-&#xD;
ed, although the officers endeavored to persuade-&#xD;
hin that it.was a temporary alienation,'caused&#xD;
by fright. The old man smiled' incredulously,&#xD;
and retired to his state-room, where at times he&#xD;
could hear the maniac-ravings of his' stricken&#xD;
enemy. At length he fell asleep, wearied by his&#xD;
emotion.&#xD;
When the steward called him in the morning,&#xD;
he found the old gentleman suffering all the ago-&#xD;
nies of a Levantine fever. His brow was burn-&#xD;
ing, his lips were parched, and he appeared&#xD;
somewhat delirious. -Luckily for his- repose,&#xD;
Lavalette, under the influence of powerful opi-&#xD;
ates and' utter exhaustion, was comparatively&#xD;
quiet.&#xD;
That morning, Captain Paskewitsch returned&#xD;
the visit of Admiral Miaulis, who invited him to&#xD;
visit the "Stamboul."  The admiral ad put a&#xD;
prize crew on board, but Zalallah was still in&#xD;
possession of the cabin, and related her story&#xD;
with a delicacy that touched the gallant sailors'&#xD;
hearts.&#xD;
Captain," said Miauls, "I gave you the&#xD;
criminal-will you take the innocent? This la-&#xD;
dy's property shall be restored to her, and will&#xD;
you not give her a passage to Malta?  he-can&#xD;
hear of her daughter' there, if she is in 'the Le-&#xD;
vant"&#xD;
"Can I not get'to Sio ?" anxiously inquired&#xD;
Zalallah. "I care not for the wealth if I can but&#xD;
obtain my daughter."&#xD;
A shade came over the countenances of her&#xD;
new-found friends,-for they had no hopes, fAn'&#xD;
her account even, that Elissa had- escaped  the&#xD;
&#xD;
massacre,--but with kind woids they persuaded&#xD;
her to go to Malta in the 'PNicolai.&#xD;
"We have 'a passenger who ist dangerously&#xD;
ill, I fear," said Captain Paskewitsch, as he&#xD;
escorted her to the state-room, designed for 'her&#xD;
accommodtion,-" Consul Orlff, of Smyrna."&#xD;
Zalallah started, and the crimson tide of shame&#xD;
suffused her countenance as she thought how&#xD;
she had been 'misunderstood by his grandson.&#xD;
Then, with true feminine kindness, she sought&#xD;
the sufferer's couch, and soothed his delirious&#xD;
ravings by her soft words and tender sympathies.&#xD;
Lavalette was transferred to the " Stamboul,"&#xD;
as an examination of his papers, found concealed&#xD;
on board that vessel, proved that his ill-gotten&#xD;
gains had been invested by Manasseh, so that&#xD;
there was but little hope of their recovery, unless&#xD;
that worthy could be found. A few days after-&#xD;
wards, and Miaulis went forth to meet theeiemy&#xD;
while the "Nicolai " was dashing to the 'south.&#xD;
ward, on her way to Malta. Time, life's great&#xD;
physician, soothed the consul's agitated pulse'&#xD;
ere they had rounded Cape Matapan, and Zalal-&#xD;
lah saw with joy that her patient was becoming&#xD;
less incoherent in his murmurings. One sunny&#xD;
afternoon, after a refreshing sleep, he awoke,&#xD;
perfectly conscious, but was surprised to find a&#xD;
lady sitting by the side of his berth. It was Za-&#xD;
lallah; and although time and trouble-those&#xD;
.inexorable co-spoilers-had marked her coun-&#xD;
tenance with their furrows, she might still have&#xD;
served as a model to those old Italian painters,&#xD;
who, with their palettes, spread with luscious&#xD;
tints, portrayed ripening beauty.&#xD;
"Not a word !" was her reply to his question-&#xD;
ing, and then vanished from the state-room; but&#xD;
soon Captain Paskewitsch entered, his bltiff&#xD;
heart overflowing with joy. He soon explained.&#xD;
what had passed, andZalallah was introduced.in&#xD;
due form. The-consul's recovery was rapid, and&#xD;
he found in his nurse one who could 'fully-sym-&#xD;
pathize with him in his misfortunes-indeed,&#xD;
they each suffered from Lavalettes basenesw--.&#xD;
from Osmar Bey's fickleness -of.heart.&#xD;
" One thing gives me happiness," said he, after&#xD;
each had unfolded their griefs, " Osmar Bey.-&#xD;
for so I suppose he islnow to be called-edid not&#xD;
rob me of my second: wife, as. I had feared.&#xD;
Where.could she have g ne            fl&#xD;
Zalallah shuddered-for she ,thought how dif-&#xD;
ferent would have been her own lot hadhe never,&#xD;
with insidious tongue, persuaded her to leave&#xD;
her husband and her child.&#xD;
That night, the "Nicolai" lay "off and on,"&#xD;

While :sitting ,thus, a thirdlady entered the&#xD;

'ther's side, "but a. few days have passed since&#xD;

'told me about my own parent. I now feel con-&#xD;

"Sister !" interrupted Zalallah, rising, and,&#xD;
with an energetic movement, seizing the countess&#xD;
by the arm, "there hangs the portray of our&#xD;
father. When he gave me away at the itar you-&#xD;

by shame, although subdued by sorrow. Pity&#xD;
'me, but do not upbraid me."&#xD;
This earnest appeal could not be resisted, and&#xD;
tears coursed down the weather-bronzed cheeks&#xD;
of Captain Paskewitsch, as he saw them ex-&#xD;
change the kiss of peace. Then 'Zala3lah intro-&#xD;
duced her daughter, and soon the group was en-&#xD;
larged by the coming of Consul Orloff. Many&#xD;
a question was asked and answered, and that&#xD;
night the sisters again occupied the room of their&#xD;
childhood, blessing, ere they slept, the daughter&#xD;

the herald of their happiness&#xD;

Consul Orloff found, by consulting with his&#xD;
correspondents at Malta, that the papers obtain-&#xD;

his property, could he but find Manasseh, and&#xD;
obtain his renunciation of the spoils invested in&#xD;
his name. This, he hoped, Alexis would suc-&#xD;
ceed in, after he had seen Osmar Bey, and pa-&#xD;
tiently did he await his arrival.&#xD;
Happy in the society of the re-united ones,&#xD;
whose web of life was so mysteriously interwo-&#xD;
ven with his own, a pensive calm came over the&#xD;
old man's thoughts, as the gentle breeze that&#xD;
lulls the ocean to rest after a tempest; and he&#xD;
looked upon his sorrows as coming from that&#xD;
Providence, whose severest hand wounds but to&#xD;
heal, and chastens to amend.&#xD;
Zalallah'never alluded to her strange interview&#xD;
with Alexis, at Consta tinople, but she felt as-&#xD;
sured that he possessed her daughter's affections.&#xD;
Not that Elissa ever mentioned his name, al-&#xD;
though he was the object of her frequent thought.&#xD;
Did he love her yet It was her heart-enigma,&#xD;
and every night she pondered over it, with her&#xD;
eyes filled with pleasant' tears, until sleep closed&#xD;

UNDTNG Lovn I Blessed and beautiful as&#xD;
the step of the messenger of glad 'tidings art&#xD;
thou, when, with magic influence, thbu lightest&#xD;
man's heart with the rays of gladness-yet sad&#xD;
is he to whom thou.bringest a burthen of disap-&#xD;
pointment. Alexis, on his first arrival at Misso-&#xD;
longhi, felt every doubt respecting Elissa's con-&#xD;
duet removed, and the tide of love swept ebbless&#xD;
through his mind, drawing into its sweeping&#xD;
current every hope and every thought. Had not&#xD;
a blockading squadron hovered off the harbor,&#xD;
he would have followed the object of his love to&#xD;
Malta without delay, nor did he even give the&#xD;
object of his errand a thought. But the Turkish&#xD;
cruisers sailed obstinately to and fro, cutting off&#xD;
all immediate prospect of leaving Missolonghi,&#xD;
now saddened by the death of the warrior-bard.&#xD;
Heavy rains postponed the funeral ceremonies;&#xD;
nor was it until the fourth day after Alexis ar-&#xD;
rived, that he followed Lord Byron's corpse to&#xD;
th6 church, where the desolation around, the&#xD;
disappointed hopes, the mourning soldiers, and&#xD;
the sad presentiments which clouded every coun-&#xD;
tenance, made -the scene more truly affecting&#xD;
than is usually witnessed when the great are laid&#xD;
in the tomb.&#xD;
A soldier's grief, however, is short-ived; and&#xD;
&#xD;
when Alexis was introduced to many of the offi-&#xD;
cers that evening, by young Cordato, his com-&#xD;
panion - on the march from Corinth, he found&#xD;
them gaily enjoying the pleasures of the table.&#xD;
Soon, to the heart-joy of the young man, the&#xD;
conversation turned to Elissa, and he felt a glow&#xD;
of pride as all united in speaking of he with&#xD;
respect..,  .&#xD;
"6 Who were her parents ?" carelesslyinquired&#xD;
a German officer.&#xD;
"Don't you know ?" replied Count Gamba.&#xD;
"Why, she is the daughter of Osmar 'Bey, the&#xD;
famous renegade, and one of Mahmbud'a sul-&#xD;
tanas. There's a deal of romance about that&#xD;
blood-thirsty-dog, after all."&#xD;
Alexis gazed with burning eye-balls at the&#xD;
count, and every word hissed through his heart&#xD;
like water dropped upon heated iron. The con-&#xD;
versation took a different turn, but making an&#xD;
excuse, he left the room, and paced the streets&#xD;
like a madman, in a pelting storm of rain. He&#xD;
felt it not; neither could it extinguish the flames&#xD;
within his heart. Many a confirmation flashed,&#xD;
like lightning, upon his clouded mind, and he&#xD;
wondered how he could so long have been blind-&#xD;
ed. The conduct of Zalallah, at Constantinople,&#xD;
was now explained-she wished to convey mo-&#xD;
&#xD;
THE RUSSIAN GUARDSMAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
ney to her child. This, too, was the secret of&#xD;
the mysterious.connection of Osmar Bey with&#xD;
Lavalette; and everything now appeared to un-&#xD;
roll itself before the mental gaze of the young&#xD;
man, whose only wonder was that he had not&#xD;
guessed the truth before. Hour after hour did&#xD;
he pace to and fro; and when, wet and weary,&#xD;
he sought his couch, he felt that the love of a&#xD;
sister-pure and holy, and guileless as it might&#xD;
be-was not the love he had yearned to receive&#xD;
from Elissa. At early ,dawn he was roused by&#xD;
young Cordato:&#xD;
" Up, laggard," said he, "you stole off early&#xD;
enough last night, and should have been dressed&#xD;
long ago to receive in state a proposition that I&#xD;
have come to make you.".&#xD;
"Which is ?" asked Alexis.&#xD;
"Don't look so sepulchral, gallant major. I&#xD;
ami to return at once to the Isthmus of Corinth,&#xD;
and as you can easily enough sail from thence-&#xD;
perhaps in the very felucca that carried you so&#xD;
bravely through the storm-I thought I would&#xD;
invite you to share the march."&#xD;
"I will goI!"&#xD;
Indeed, had any one proposed going to Jeru-&#xD;
salem, or running the blockade in a row-boat,&#xD;
Alexis would have volunteered with alacrity,&#xD;
merely to drown his thoughts.  I&#xD;
Ere the sun was up, the Suliotes were on the&#xD;
march, and soon, leaving the plain, they were&#xD;
among the glorious mountains of that glorious&#xD;
land. The very air, amid those classic shrines,&#xD;
has a balmy softness that relaxes both mind and&#xD;
body into pleasing lassitude, and althoughAlexis&#xD;
did not feel disposed to join Cordato inhis mer-&#xD;
riment, the pure 'breeze had an ethereal effect,&#xD;
and he journeyed on, alike careless of the pres-&#xD;
ent, the past, and the future.&#xD;
As they approached Athens, the Suliotes were&#xD;
unusually' *arf, for the few peasants they met&#xD;
agreed" in repdrting large scouting-parties of&#xD;
Turkish cavalry as hovering around the passes.&#xD;
Platma, however, was reached without any en-&#xD;
counter, and there they found the deserted Ivil-&#xD;
lage already occupied by two other bands of Si-&#xD;
liotes, with whom those of Cordato soon were&#xD;
enjoying their coffee and pipes. The young pal-&#xD;
ikar chief pressed Alexis to join their revelry;&#xD;
but he Aeclined, under plea of illness, and saun-&#xD;
tered forth.&#xD;
It was a beautiful night; the moon riding high&#xD;
in'the heavens, surrounded by her starry court,&#xD;
while the clouds-those curtains to her palace-&#xD;
were all so raised as to afford a full view of the&#xD;
&#xD;
arched dome. But little cared Alexis about the&#xD;
beauties of the scene without, for wild tumult&#xD;
reigned in his heart, where he could not welcome&#xD;
Elissa with a mere sisterly affection. All at&#xD;
once his practised ear caught the coming tread&#xD;
of horse, and before he 'could reach the house&#xD;
where the palikars were carousing, a sentry fired&#xD;
his musket, giving the dread alarm:&#xD;
" The Turks ! the Turks I"&#xD;
In an instant the sleeping Suliotes were bn&#xD;
their feet, busied, as by instinct, in preparations&#xD;
for defence, with the least possible- exposure.&#xD;
Barricades were hastily constructed,-for the&#xD;
enemy had halted on finding their - approach&#xD;
known,-and behind one of these fragile en-&#xD;
trenchments Alexis took his stand, beside Cor-&#xD;
dato. He -had mechanically taken an offered&#xD;
carbine, and rather rejoiced when he saw the en-&#xD;
emy approach, waving their yataghans, and ut-&#xD;
tering the war-cry of their faith:&#xD;
" Hut In! uAllahI hu1"&#xD;
The Suliotes awaited their charge in breath-&#xD;
less silence. Lips moved in prayer, but there&#xD;
was no sound; devout signs of the cross were&#xD;
made when the petitions were ended, but no eye&#xD;
ceased to glance along the death-charged barrel&#xD;
towards the approaching foe. On they came;&#xD;
nor were they more than ten feet distant from&#xD;
the barrier when it gleamed with flashes, and-a&#xD;
deadly volley was poured into the dense mass.&#xD;
Horses and riders were-overthrown in their oea-&#xD;
reer, for a time arresting the progress of those&#xD;
behind them, and the Suliotes had hopes of'jvie-&#xD;
tory. But at the very moment when their hopes&#xD;
were highest, there came a troop which had en-&#xD;
tered at some less defended part of'the town,&#xD;
and attacked them in the rear.&#xD;
There was no bulwark against this new'f6re,&#xD;
and the defenders of the barricade were now like&#xD;
a vessel in the vortex of a maelstrom, unable to&#xD;
escape, for around them waved a circle of death-&#xD;
dealing blades. Yet it was a struggle for life&#xD;
and death, nor was it until after an hour of car-&#xD;
nage that the Turks found themselves victorious.&#xD;
Among the wounded was Alexis, who was struck&#xD;
by a pistol-ball in the shoulder at the beginning&#xD;
of the contest, but luckily fell into .the ditch,&#xD;
where ho escaped being trampled on when the&#xD;
attack was made from the rear.&#xD;
When Alexis recovered his senses, he found&#xD;
himself in a comfortable bed, in a handsomely-&#xD;
furnished room. His wound had been carefully&#xD;
dressed, and, probably owing to loss of bleod&#xD;
and want of food, no fever had supervened,--&#xD;

But when, on entering the room, he saw the&#xD;
once brilliant looking officer stretched upon his&#xD;
couch, his fine features haggard with the ravages&#xD;
of feverish anxiety, his eyes dimmed with tears,&#xD;
and an expression of sorrow playing around his&#xD;
mouth, lie forgot all, save that his father was&#xD;
before him. A gush of filial love submerged all&#xD;
other feelings, and, grasping the extended hand,&#xD;
he dropped upon his knees at the sufferer's side,&#xD;
exclaiming:&#xD;
"My father! my dear father 1-have I found&#xD;
you at last?"&#xD;
A  bright flush lit up the invalid's hollow&#xD;
cheeks, and his listless eye flashed bright, as he&#xD;
replied :'&#xD;
Thanks, my dear son, for this kind greeting&#xD;
to one so unworthy of it. Sit down by me, now,&#xD;
and let me talk with you."&#xD;
Alexis seated himself by the bedside, and the&#xD;
bey, still holding his hand, continued:-&#xD;
"My son,-O, what joy it givds me so to ad-&#xD;
dress you,-your grandfather did ime grievous&#xD;
wrong. He blighted my heart hopes ; he offered&#xD;
me as a sacrifice upon the altar of his pride; he&#xD;
separated me from the loved bride of my choice;&#xD;
and I, miserable and desolate, vowed revenge.&#xD;
It was my god, to whom I devoted my every&#xD;
energy. In the stormy ranks of battle, on the&#xD;
raging seas, among strange companions and&#xD;
through political intrigues, have I nirsed my&#xD;
desire to retaliate with ten-fold force ray wrongs.&#xD;
To gratify the cravings of revenge I forswore&#xD;
my creed-cringed before, flattered, or command-&#xD;
ed others-and I succeeded.   I have glutted&#xD;
my vengeance. upon those who seconded your&#xD;
grandfather's stern resolve-and he is stripped&#xD;
of his wealth. But now I humble myself before&#xD;
you and before my God. Pardon me, AlexisI&#xD;
-Pardon your unhappy father 1" .    .&#xD;
"May God forgive you, as I do, my poor fa-&#xD;
ther I" replied the son, his eyes filled with tears&#xD;
-for it was evident that his father had known&#xD;
but little happiness.&#xD;
Ah! my son, I fear that there is no pardon&#xD;
for such a vile wretch-conscience, like the light-&#xD;
ning's flash, came from the bloody field of Pla-&#xD;
tea, and my impregnable citadel of revengeful&#xD;
pride is but a blackened ,heap of ashes."&#xD;
"Will you not see my grandfather ?" inquired&#xD;
Alexis. " He is as generous as he is good."&#xD;
A sullen air of gloomy defiance came over the&#xD;
bey's face at the idea of seeing for pardon before&#xD;
him to whose hardness of heart he attributed his&#xD;
whole career of crime. It was a bitter thought&#xD;

but he had chastened his heart, and a convulsive&#xD;
effort restored tranquillity to his features.&#xD;
"Alexis, I-"&#xD;
The struggle was too much for his feeble&#xD;
frame, and he sank back, a- small current of&#xD;
frothy blood trickling from his parted lips. His&#xD;
eyes glared with a fixed stare, and Alexis shouted&#xD;
loudly for help. Ere the surgeon came, the&#xD;
young man's wound had opened, and he fell in&#xD;
a swoon across his father's couch.&#xD;
The sun was set ere Alexis recovered his con-&#xD;
sciousness, and, after vainly endeavoring to re-&#xD;
call the interview- with his father, he fell into a&#xD;
slumber, from which he did not awake until near-&#xD;
ly noon the next day. To his great joy, he saw&#xD;
a well-known form sitting by the window, and&#xD;
.exclaimed:&#xD;
"Achmet !-does my father live ?"&#xD;
"He does," replied the faithful Mameluke,&#xD;
who had that morning arrived f'om Smyrna, and&#xD;
had been ordered to attend Alexis. "Nay, he was&#xD;
in'this room an hour ago, to kiss you ere he left.'&#xD;
" Left! Where has he gone ?"&#xD;
" That, major, I cannot tell you. No one but&#xD;
a man of his iron nerve, and unconquerable will,&#xD;
would have left his bed for a month after such&#xD;
an attack as he had last night. But lie is away&#xD;
this morning-look, he is in yonder felucca."&#xD;
"And I-am I a prisoner here ?"&#xD;
"Yes, major; with the surgeon for a jailor,&#xD;
and myself for a turnkey. The moment you&#xD;
have served out your sentence you will be lib-&#xD;
erated."&#xD;
" Sentence ! what sentence ?" eagerly inquired&#xD;
Alexis, who could not comprehend his position.&#xD;
* "Simply, major, that you were accused of ill-&#xD;
ness, sentenced to remain here until cured, and&#xD;
ordered to live on rations that will scarcely sup-&#xD;
port a cat. But when well again-flints and&#xD;
scabbards 1-but'there will be joy at Malta."&#xD;
"Has my grandfather arrived there, then I"&#xD;
"lHe has, major; and is now an occupant of&#xD;
the same house with Maden'oiselle Elissa?&#xD;
Alexis sighed.&#xD;
"It seems," said he, after a moment'&amp;amp; reflee&#xD;
tion, " that Elissa is my sister."&#xD;
"e Your sister, major ?" and the old veteran,&#xD;
rising, approached the bedside; "she is no more&#xD;
your sister than I am. Where did you get that&#xD;
idea?"&#xD;
Did, Alexis hear aright? Again his cup of&#xD;
joy was filled, and he felt that life had charms.&#xD;
"I think," said he, "that I shall be able to go&#xD;
out to-morrow."&#xD;

by Achmet in the seaport of Athens, was a dull,&#xD;
heavy sailer; the winds were adverse, and the&#xD;
young man had almost lost patience when th6y&#xD;
came in sight of the desired haven. At last he&#xD;
reached the quay, and Achmet was able to min-&#xD;
ister to his impatience by conducting him to the&#xD;
residence of his grandfather-and of Elissa.&#xD;
Consul Orloff had gone out, but the countess,,&#xD;
who immediately recognized Alexis, from the&#xD;
diescriytions she had had of him, invited him to&#xD;

"It is Major Orloff;" said she, "if I mistake&#xD;
not; and there is a lady in the drawing-room&#xD;
who -will entertain you until the old gentleman&#xD;

Thanking her, Alexis felt his blood course joy-&#xD;
ously through every vein as he followed her up&#xD;
the broad staircase, and into a spacious drawing-&#xD;
room. Entering' alone, he found-not the idol&#xD;

defaced by time. ' There was, too, a strong re-&#xD;
semblance to some one, he knew not who. The&#xD;
door opened, and in glided Elissa, a bright flush&#xD;
tinging her cleariclassical face, while her glad-&#xD;
ness of heart shone out from beneath her long&#xD;
eye-lashes, as she advanced towards Alexis, hold-&#xD;
ing out both hands.&#xD;
"Welcome to Malta, Major Orloff. We had&#xD;
begun to fear for your safety, and-and your&#xD;
grandf ther will be rejoiced to see you, looking&#xD;
so well, too." Then, recollecting herself, she&#xD;
turned:&#xD;
"My mother I Major Orloff."&#xD;

Annoying as it was at the time, major, your&#xD;

abruptly, I should not -have seen my daughter."&#xD;
As she spoke, Elissa stole gently to her side,&#xD;
and encircling her waist with one of her beauti-&#xD;
&amp;amp;ld arms, the mother and daughter presented a&#xD;
charming picture. Just then, in came Consul&#xD;
Orloff, and in a moment Alexis was clasped in&#xD;
the old gentleman's warm embrace.&#xD;
"Thank God for your return, my dear boy,"&#xD;
said he, tears of joy streaming down his wrinkled&#xD;
checks. "I feared some accident -might have&#xD;
happened to you, and that would have been&#xD;
harder to bear than the loss of fortune. Come,&#xD;

"But, my dear sir," interrupted the astonished&#xD;
young man.&#xD;
"Not a word-you have managed the matter&#xD;
capitally."&#xD;
Then, as if struck by a sudden idea, the old&#xD;
gentleman jumped up and asked Zalallah if she&#xD;
would walk down stairs with him, to consult&#xD;
with the countess about a room for the stranger.&#xD;

tone, "do not again repulse me. You might&#xD;

The description, given by Alexis, of his heart-&#xD;

him to visit Smyrna, if they all returned there.&#xD;

father to his Elissa.&#xD;
A  few weeks passed  almost ippereeptibly&#xD;
away while the necessary preparations for the&#xD;
wedding were in progress. Almost every post&#xD;
brought the consul advices of some investment&#xD;
in his favor, made by Manasseh, and they all&#xD;
concluded that the repentant Osmar Bey had&#xD;
forced the accomplice 'of his vengeance to dis-&#xD;

and when the consul and his grandson came to&#xD;

"What can it be !" said Alexis, slightly-&#xD;
changing coler-for Siberia, with all its horrors,&#xD;
is ever before the subjects of the autocrat.&#xD;
"I will soon tell you what mine is," replied&#xD;
the consul, breaking the seal, and reading the&#xD;
enclosed despatch. It was thus worded:&#xD;
"Whereas I' Nicholas, Autocrat of the Rus-&#xD;
sias, and Head of the Greek Church, have every&#xD;
reason to be satisfied with your conduct as our&#xD;
consul, at Smyrna, from which post you are&#xD;
hereby dismissed, I constitute you a count of our&#xD;
empire, with an annual pension suitable to your&#xD;
rknk."&#xD;
"His majesty is very kind," continued the&#xD;
consul, "but I should have preferred the simple,&#xD;
title of 'consul,' with my old residence. Who is&#xD;
its fortunate possessor now, I wonder? I envy&#xD;
him, for no other house in Smyrna will ever&#xD;

"And what is-your order, Alexis ?" asked the&#xD;
countess, while Elissa, with tearful eyes, gazed'&#xD;
at the paper with apprehension.&#xD;
Alexis broke the seal, read the enclosure, and&#xD;
then, as if-in doubt, re-read it. * Give me joy "&#xD;
he exclaimed, and he read:&#xD;
"Whereas I, Nicholas, Autocrat of all the&#xD;
Russias, and Head of the Greek Church, have&#xD;
learned the faithful services of your venerable&#xD;

"Long live the emperor!"said the elder Orloff.&#xD;
" Grandfather, you will not have to move from&#xD;

Overjoyed at this pleasing intelligence, the&#xD;
happf group sat chatting around the.ta19e, entil&#xD;
the arrival of Elissa's bridesmaids sent all to&#xD;
their toilets.&#xD;
"Don't hurry, major," growled Aehmet,&#xD;
through his moustache. "Flints and scabbards!&#xD;
there'll be no wedding until you go to the cathe-&#xD;
dral."&#xD;
Already had the bells, with joyous peal sun,&#xD;
&#xD;
moned the noble and the fair, the gallant and the.&#xD;
beautiful to the cathedral, where once the bold&#xD;
knights knelt in prayer. Nor was it many mo.&#xD;
ments after the appointed hour, ere the- bridal&#xD;
party made its way through the crowd,welcomed&#xD;
by the gladsome notes 4f the choir, and the deep,&#xD;
full notes of the organ.&#xD;
Elissa, the observed of all observers, was&#xD;
beautiful beyond the usual measure of bridal&#xD;
loveliness, as she moved through the cathedral,.&#xD;
like a wild swan floating on the waters. The.&#xD;
softness-of her full eye, the coral richness of her,&#xD;
rose-tinted lips, and the rapid succession of mod-&#xD;
est blushes that occupied her soft, full checks,&#xD;
were charms that, would require the peculiar&#xD;
power of Titian's pencil to portray. Her glossy&#xD;
hair seemed struggling, in ils profusion, to escape-&#xD;
from the wreath of orange-blossoms with which&#xD;
it was confined. Neither did theigauzy folds of&#xD;
a long veil conceal her radiant features, as it fell&#xD;
low over the plain white satin robe that fitted&#xD;
closely to the outlines of her matchless- form.&#xD;
As she stood before the altar, her figure in per-&#xD;
feet repose, with the roseate flush of love tinging&#xD;
the alabaster-like purity of her face end her arms,&#xD;
the most envious among her own sex admired&#xD;
her, while many a gallant officer envied her&#xD;
bridegroom.&#xD;
Alexis was no less an object of admiration, as&#xD;
he, stood flushed with moral intoxication, and&#xD;
pledged his troth to the trembling one at his.&#xD;
side. A playful smile upon his lips bespoke the&#xD;
joy of his heart, and yet he could but feel sol-&#xD;
emnly as vowed, at that holy altar, to love, to&#xD;
cherish, and to protect his wedded wife. Amid&#xD;
the deluge of his recent troubles, and perils, and&#xD;
anxieties, her love had been the ark which had&#xD;
borne him above the waters, and in his heart he&#xD;
prayed for divine aid in keeping his solemn&#xD;
vows.&#xD;
Little thotight the happy group around the&#xD;
altar, that among the spectators was one in whom,&#xD;
all took a deep interest. It was Osmar Bey, the&#xD;
renegade, who, for the first time since he had&#xD;
abjured Christianity, had entered a Christian&#xD;
church. Well disguised, he had obtained a seet&#xD;
where he could witness the ceremony,and he felt&#xD;
every nerve thrill as the solemn service proceed-&#xD;
ed. At last, all was over, and the organ poured&#xD;
out a perfect deluge of pyo"s notes, rolling in&#xD;
gladness along the vaulted roof, while the choir&#xD;
burst forth into that thanksgiving anthem: "0,&#xD;
come, let us sing unto the LordI Let us heartily&#xD;
rejoice in the strength of His, salvation"  Com-&#xD;
&#xD;
forted and strengthened, he joined the throng,&#xD;
congratulating the happy pair; and there, at the&#xD;
altar, the mystery was solved-Osmar Bey was&#xD;
Manasseh! Manasseh existed not, save in the&#xD;
disguise of Osmar Bey. Moved by an impulse,&#xD;
the bride and bridegroom knelt at his-feet, and&#xD;
felt his :scalding tears as he leaned over them.,&#xD;
When they arose he was gone!f -&#xD;
The elder Orloff, restored to his fortune, again&#xD;
took the - lead of the Levantine commerce, al-&#xD;
though he never entrusted his books to another's&#xD;
care, enjoying the society of his grandchildren.&#xD;
His temporary embarrassment, when the causes&#xD;
were guessed at, but strengthened his credit, and&#xD;
he enjoyed what he most coveted-the confidence&#xD;
&#xD;
and esteem which invariably attend on mercan-&#xD;
tile integrity. Osmar Bey was never seen after&#xD;
his appearance, disguised as Manasseh, at -the&#xD;
wedding of Alexis. It was ascertained that-&#xD;
probably a victim to remorse-he had carefully&#xD;
restored all the funds abstracted from the capital&#xD;
of Consul Orloff, and then, with an idiotic at-&#xD;
tendant, who was ever talking of book-keeping,&#xD;
h'e had gbne into Upper India. His after fate&#xD;
was unknown. Perhaps his repentant spirit fled&#xD;
amid some raging storm of fire and steel, with&#xD;
the proud cheer of victory as a requiem ; or else,&#xD;
without a fond hand to close his eyes, he sank&#xD;
peacefully to rest in his new home,&#xD;

CHAPTER 1*&#xD;
THE Rhine flowed along in its loveliness at and precipitous on every side but one, it was a&#xD;

&#xD;
HUGO VON El3NFE.&#xD;
&#xD;
times of revelling resounded far over the hills&#xD;
and valleys, and by night, the ever burning&#xD;
watchfires flashed and glowed in the smooth sur-&#xD;
face of the river. It was a glorious, a poeticaL&#xD;
scene, impressive at all times to the imagina-&#xD;
tion; a scene which in those days) and in our&#xD;
times, has drawni forth the genius of poet and&#xD;
painter.&#xD;
Among all the youths of the Rhenish castle,&#xD;
none was braver or more accomplished than the&#xD;
noble Hugo von Ehrenfels. Left fatherless at a&#xD;
tender age, his education devolved upon his&#xD;
mother and grandfather. The last of his race,&#xD;
they viewed with the most tender solicitude the&#xD;
early years of Hugo's life, and taught him all&#xD;
the manly arts and attainments of that warlike&#xD;
age. None could shoot the arrow more uner-&#xD;
ringly than he; none'could more ably manage a&#xD;
fiery steed, or use more, expertly the heavier&#xD;
arms. While lugo was almost perfect in all&#xD;
these bolder and rougher pursuits, he also pos-&#xD;
sessed qualities whichfew could boast of in that&#xD;
illiterate age. He had learnt the wonderful se-&#xD;
cret of reading and writing from the chaplain of&#xD;
the castle. From the wandering minstrels and&#xD;
the aged bards of his home, he had acquired the&#xD;
noble art of uttering his warm emotions in im-&#xD;
passioned verse, aid could vie with his teachers&#xD;
in the singing of songs of love, war or pleasure.&#xD;
Thus it was that Hugo's name was spoken with&#xD;
admiration everywhere, and that he was the&#xD;
pride of his family, the envy of his companions,&#xD;
and the love of many a beauteous maiden. Such&#xD;
mingled accomplishments however, did not&#xD;
cause him to become vain or boastful, but they&#xD;
showed in a strong relief the modesty and great-&#xD;
ness of his soul.&#xD;
There was one who had fixed unalterably his&#xD;
affections, and that one was worthy of his love.&#xD;
She was a beautiful, impassioned girl, earnest&#xD;
and affectionate as she was .lovely. They had&#xD;
been brought up in the same castle from early&#xD;
years, for the same blow which had renidered&#xD;
Hugo fatherless, had left Hulda an orphan.&#xD;
Her castle was kept by an ancient friend of her&#xD;
father's in trust for tlke child. "She was one of&#xD;
those lovely beings such as we see in marble, or&#xD;
on the canvass,'amohg the -most priceless treas-&#xD;
ures of art. . Her hair was dark, and fell down,&#xD;
in floods upon her shoulders Nqr eyes were in-&#xD;
tensely black, yet sft and melting as those of&#xD;
a gazelle; and her features were of that style&#xD;
called Grecian-as faultless as those of -the&#xD;
sculptor's ideal.&#xD;
&#xD;
They had long been happy in the knowledge&#xD;
of one another's affection, and one year more&#xD;
would usher in their bridal day; the day which&#xD;
would join the two lovers and the estates of Man-&#xD;
nafore and Ehrenfels. Thus would the fondl&#xD;
hopes of Hugo's noble mother be fulfilled, and&#xD;
her maternal love for Hulda be entirely satisfied.&#xD;
The Baron von   eitung sat in his chamber&#xD;
with his sister. He was a dark and gloomy&#xD;
man in his appearance. There was a sinister&#xD;
expression in his countenance, which was height-&#xD;
ened by a wound upon the forehead, received&#xD;
during some conflict. His sister possessed the&#xD;
same stern countenance, though the expression&#xD;
was somewhat softened by feminine nature. The&#xD;
Feitung family did not mingle much with the&#xD;
nobles around them. They were seldom present&#xD;
at any feast or general convocation. They were&#xD;
spoken of as base, and treacherous, and their&#xD;
aversion for society was returned by the objects&#xD;
of it. Yet there was one place which Von Fei-&#xD;
tung seemed to like, and that was Ehrenfels.&#xD;
His visits there were frequent. Hugo was often&#xD;
cautioned against him, but his honest nature re-&#xD;
pelled every thought that niight be injurious to&#xD;
his friend. Yet there were some who thought&#xD;
that in his visits to Ehrenstein, something be-&#xD;
sides courtesy was intended, and that something&#xD;
more than a respect for Hulda lurkcd,in his&#xD;
bosom.&#xD;
"I cannot," said he to his sister, after a long&#xD;
silence, "I cannot divest myself of this powerful&#xD;
feeling which has taken so strong a possession&#xD;
of my heart. I cannot overcome it. I must&#xD;
yielo to its power."&#xD;
" You cannot !" cried his sister in scorn. "Is&#xD;
this the strength of your manhood? Be a man.&#xD;
Call up the power of your will and overcome&#xD;
your desires."&#xD;
"Talk on, sister-talk on-but I must say&#xD;
that if my own energy cannot of itself overcome&#xD;
my passion, your words will be useless. Hulda,&#xD;
O if I could but obtain her-by Jove twill ob-&#xD;
tain her, even if I have to scale the rock of&#xD;
Ehrenstein alone."&#xD;
"Hulda I" said his sister. "Shame for one&#xD;
like you to be overcome by a love for so puny&#xD;
and weak a creature. . ShameI- Must a man go&#xD;
crazy about a baby, and talk of scaling the rock&#xD;
of Ehrenstein "&#xD;
"Do not speak so to me," cried Von Feitung,&#xD;
savagely. "I swear by Heaven that I will nev2^&#xD;

er cease from efforts to gain by fair means or&#xD;
flul, the beautiful girl. Can I control the fires&#xD;
that spring up and burn so furiously within me 1'&#xD;
Teil the winds to be cilm."&#xD;
"Bow do you hope to'do it?" said his siste-,&#xD;
with an effort to be calm.&#xD;
"I know not yet. I will continue and study,&#xD;
every way to gain my object. But it will be a&#xD;
hard task. If they were-not so intimate-if they'&#xD;
had not known one another so long, then jeal-&#xD;
ousy, or suspicion, or misrepresentation might&#xD;
divide them."&#xD;
"fGo on," she' said; with stronger efforts at&#xD;
calmness.,&#xD;
hBut this cannot be done. The fool of a boy&#xD;
has what they call an honest disposition.  He&#xD;
cannot think ill of others. I must try other&#xD;
means."&#xD;
"What other means?"&#xD;
A dark, a fearful gloom came over his coun-&#xD;
tenance.&#xD;
"Brother,"  cried she, starting up, unable&#xD;
longer to control herself, "brother, you shall&#xD;
not.' What, are you -fallen so low, and is all&#xD;
honor --so dead within you, that you would&#xD;
dard to think of foul injury to Ehrenstein0? 0,&#xD;
can the blood of our race become so vile-? You&#xD;
are not my brother. You' are some false preten-&#xD;
der, some changeling of a nurse. - Listen-if the&#xD;
slightest evil befall young Hugo, then you may&#xD;
dread the vengeance of your sister I"&#xD;
Feitung looked after her as she retired from&#xD;
the room, but said not a word.&#xD;
After her departure, he rose from his seat and&#xD;
walking up to the terrace, paced up and down&#xD;
for a long time, buried in thought. Sometimes-&#xD;
hii stood leAning over the battlement, and gazed&#xD;
silently at the river. Again he would turn&#xD;
away and walk on.&#xD;
Yes," he muttered slowly, clenching his,&#xD;
hand, and standing immoveably. "I will do-&#xD;
it, and the next year shall see Hlda the bride&#xD;
of Feitung, or -else I shall be the destroyer of&#xD;
my life, for I cannot endure the sufferings which&#xD;
I now feel."&#xD;
Music came stealing on the breeze down the&#xD;
river froin Ehrenstein, now risingloud and high,&#xD;
now falling and dying away in the distance. It&#xD;
was evening, and the river was tranquil, the&#xD;
moon shone from an unclouded sky, and all Na-&#xD;
ture was lying in calm repose. The watchfires&#xD;
gleamed like stars from the summits of baronial&#xD;
&#xD;
castle, and blazed most brightly from the tow-&#xD;
ers of Ehrenstein.' At the base of the keep&#xD;
Hugo stood, accompanying the notes of a guitar,&#xD;
with a voice which sounded melodiously all&#xD;
Around. He stood beneath the window of Hul-&#xD;
da's apartment, aid looked up to catch a glimpse&#xD;
of his love. While Feitung was so busily form-&#xD;
ing his dark designsagainst his happiness, Hugo,&#xD;
unconscious of danger, sang this little love song:&#xD;
"L TeMioon on hIgh Illumes the sky,&#xD;
And soft'the b~rze comes o'er the mountains;&#xD;
I hear the flow of waves below,&#xD;
Ihear'the sound of gushing fountains.&#xD;
A d far and wide, on every side,&#xD;
Harmonious music charms mine ear;&#xD;
All, all arountd,,the soothing sound&#xD;
Of Nature's melody I hear.&#xD;
"Look from above, my own true love,&#xD;
And from the turrt bending over,&#xD;
List to my lay, and 0 display&#xD;
Thy beauty to thy longing lover.&#xD;
For though I love to vidw above.&#xD;
The glories of the summer sky,,&#xD;
Yet lovelier far than every star,,&#xD;
h the bright-glance of Hulda's eye."&#xD;
" Hugo," said a gentle voice above him.&#xD;
Hulda," cried Hugo.&#xD;
"Sing on," said Hulda. "I would not dis-&#xD;
turb you, for I love to hear your voice."&#xD;
"How would my poor song sound with the'&#xD;
music of your voice,'my Hulda?" said Hugo.&#xD;
After a short conversation, Hugo entered the&#xD;
castlIand with Hulda walked about the terrace,&#xD;
talking -over a thousand plans which future time&#xD;
would give opportunity to execute.-&#xD;
"I like not that Feitung," said Hulda, after a&#xD;
pause. "I am afraid of him. I cannot endure&#xD;
the glances which he casts atme. I fear that his&#xD;
-thoughts bode no good."&#xD;
"If he has dared to-"&#xD;
"No, not'that. He is always respectful. But&#xD;
I want'you to be more watchful of him, and be&#xD;
on your guard. Do not get into his power."&#xD;
"His power?   What power has he?    But I&#xD;
fear him not, and I would not have suspicion of&#xD;
him. You are too timid, my Halda."&#xD;
"Perhaps'so--but 0 Hugo, I fear something&#xD;
unfortunate will come to ms through this man.&#xD;
His keen, searching, hurried glances at me, and&#xD;
the dark scowls which sometimes are cast at you,,&#xD;
are fearful; and cannot but betoken harm."&#xD;
" That is only in his disposition. He is a&#xD;
very gloomy man, you know, but do -not let us&#xD;
talk of this. I promise to take care of myself.&#xD;
Come, drive away your anxiety-clouds do not&#xD;

&#xD;
become you, and they prevent the sun of your&#xD;
favor from shining on me."&#xD;
Happy interview. Long was the weary time&#xD;
that passed away before they had another meet-&#xD;
ing, so happy--and bitter was the sorrow which&#xD;
both were doomed to feel before their loving eyes&#xD;
should meet. And Halda seemed to dread this,&#xD;
for the evening farewell was spoken in sad and,&#xD;
sorrowful tones, which caused a like emotion&#xD;
even in the joyous and cheerful heart of Hugo.&#xD;
Every morning at early dawn, Hugo was ac-&#xD;
customed to go out alone, and with his bow and&#xD;
arrows to bring down 'birds, or shoot the stag&#xD;
upon which he might come by stealth. Often he&#xD;
would go to the foot of the cliff, and swim in the&#xD;
river, or lie upon th6 bank engaged in pleasing&#xD;
reflections.&#xD;
On the morning after his departure froni&#xD;
Hulda, he came down to the river side at a dis-&#xD;
tance from the castle, about half way between it&#xD;
and that of Feitung. Here he reclined upon the&#xD;
bank, and soon was deeply engaged in thinking&#xD;
,ipon one favorite theme-the beautiful Hulda,&#xD;
He thought of her last words. "Yes, I will be&#xD;
more careful," he muttered to himself. "I do&#xD;
not like to hear of'his sinister glances at myself,&#xD;
and particularly at Hulda. If he is my. friend,&#xD;
why does he act so strangely?  Perhaps it is&#xD;
nothing, but at any rate I will watch him."&#xD;
A)crackling among the bushes arrested his&#xD;
attention. He turned quickly round, but seeing&#xD;
nothing, again busied himself in pleasing thought&#xD;
Another rustling and crackling he heard,-but h4&#xD;
did not notice it. At last there was the noise of&#xD;
,steel close beside him. .Quick as lightning h&#xD;
turned, and saw a number of men close to him,&#xD;
who, before he could move, or even utter an ex&#xD;
clamation of surprise, seized him, bound him,&#xD;
gagged him, and taking him in their arms, bore&#xD;
him down the river. All this was done in ad&#xD;
incredibly short space of time, so that thought&#xD;
and action were impossible. In the utmost as-&#xD;
tonishment and indignation, he endeavored&#xD;
to burst his bonds, but they were too strong.&#xD;
The men who were carrying him were masked&#xD;
and armed to the teeth. He did .not know what&#xD;
kind of men they were, or to whom they belong-&#xD;
ed, for there was'no badge upon them by ,which&#xD;
to judge. One who seemed to be their leader,&#xD;
walked apart, apparently anxious to avoid die.&#xD;
covery. While narrowly examining this man'a&#xD;
fggre, and walk, a thought &amp;amp;ashed across Hi&#xD;
g's mind, which chilled his blood. Yet this&#xD;
&#xD;
thought was instantly driven away, and would&#xD;
perhaps not againhave been entertained, haditnot&#xD;
been that this man's face was at times turned&#xD;
toward the prisoner.  He wore a mask which&#xD;
reached to the mouth, but that mouth with its&#xD;
savage expression, rendered fiercer by a scar&#xD;
over the chin, could be no other than that of&#xD;
Feitung.&#xD;
Then Hugo knew all-knew the villain who&#xD;
was carrying him off in this base manner. Then&#xD;
the words of Hulda returned*to his memoryo-&#xD;
her'suspicions, her description of Feitung's looks,&#xD;
'all came before him.' But he did' not know&#xD;
whither they were carrying him--whether to&#xD;
death or captivity. He feared the villany of&#xD;
this man, and with agonizing thoughts he vainly&#xD;
tried to banish his anxiety for Hulda. Ehren-&#xD;
stein was strong, and all its guards were faithful,&#xD;
but he knew that rocky-cliffs and massive walls&#xD;
were no protection against the insidious wiles of&#xD;
cunning.&#xD;
They carried him on,  nd he soon saw they&#xD;
were directing their course toward a creek where&#xD;
among the trees that shaded its branches, he siw&#xD;
the mast of a vessel.&#xD;
They came to-the creek and placed Hugo on-&#xD;
board, carrying him down below where none&#xD;
might see him. The leader conversed with them&#xD;
long and earnestly, apparently giving them Oi-&#xD;
.reetions, and after bidding them adieu, he left,&#xD;
and mounting upon a steed that was standing&#xD;
near, he rode swiftly towards the castle of&#xD;
Feitung.&#xD;
The-men prepared. to depart.  They pushed&#xD;
the vessel out, into the river, hoisted the sgl,&#xD;
bent to their oars, and so with wind and the&#xD;
swift current, they rapidly passed d&amp;amp;wn the river,&#xD;
Hugo struggled long to break his bonds-ie&#xD;
groaned at the gag which prevented him from&#xD;
speaking or shouting; he pulled and strained at&#xD;
the fastening of his hands, till his wrists bled&#xD;
with the violence. Many hours he lay there a&#xD;
helpless captive, amid -friendly and powerful ba-&#xD;
ronial castles, which rose upon either bank of&#xD;
the river. And he, the mighty lord oflh'renfels,&#xD;
who -could count six -hundred retainers within&#xD;
his, castle, even in peaceful times-he, who a few&#xD;
hours ago, could summon to his aid hosts. of&#xD;
noble friends-was now as helpless as his most&#xD;
miserable serf. Had a king. thus sent him into&#xD;
captivity, even then his mortification and ven-&#xD;
geance would -have been great,-but to be over-&#xD;
eome by the inferior lord of Feitung-it was too&#xD;
much !&#xD;

&#xD;
But the first bitter pangs passed away, and,&#xD;
calling up his fortitude, he eptdeavored to meet&#xD;
his fate with firm resolution. After several days&#xD;
they came out into the sea. During this time&#xD;
the gag had remained fastened on him, except&#xD;
rhen food was given him. - But now, when it&#xD;
sea, he was let loose from his chains, and allow-&#xD;
ed to walk about the deck. He attempted to&#xD;
converse with some of the men, but could not&#xD;
understand them. By what he could gain from&#xD;
them by signs, however, he found out that they&#xD;
were Northmen, who, sailing up the Rhine in,&#xD;
quest of adventures, hail been brought over by&#xD;
Feitung-for this purpose.&#xD;
He attempted to make them change their pur-&#xD;
pose, and carry him back, by offering them&#xD;
great treasure. But these men, jealous of their&#xD;
word of promise, even in a villanous undertak-&#xD;
ing, utterly refused all his offers.&#xD;
Many days they sailed over the sea, beaten&#xD;
about by wind and storm, and tossed-by the an-&#xD;
gry waves of the Northern sea, but at-last the&#xD;
rugged cliffs of Norway appeared in the distance,&#xD;
hailed with joy by these northern warriors, but&#xD;
with deep despair by Hugo.&#xD;
He was carried to Drontheim, where at that&#xD;
:inte King,-Olaf-ruled. Beingno ordinary pris-&#xD;
oner, the king took an interest in him, and in.&#xD;
stead of making him a slave, lodged himwithin&#xD;
the walls of-his own' castle.: Soon the story lof&#xD;
his wrongs was- told, and the indignant monarh&#xD;
swore by all that was holy in Scandinavia, td&#xD;
restore' Hugo to his home.- "As for-youri-e-&#xD;
venge," criEd Olaf, "I will not interfere there'"&#xD;
The-fame of Hugo; his wrongs, his beauty,&#xD;
and -rmanly accomplishments -were sbon known&#xD;
-f-and wide.-&#xD;
AHis - wonderful dexterity-with the -arrow, and&#xD;
'Javelifia with swordand shield, km horse and foot,&#xD;

'were-sung. And while the.skilds in Olaf's court&#xD;
sang tleir lofty-strainst of the - deeds of vikings'&#xD;
the harp of-Hugo was tuned- to songs of the&#xD;

Three years had passed since hisyatuire;and&#xD;

with the spoils of the South.&#xD;
CHAPTER II.&#xD;
After Hugo's seizure, the people at Ehrenstein&#xD;
were thrown into a fearful state of anxiety. Day&#xD;
after day they awaited, his return, but still he&#xD;
came not. . The news of this misfortune spread&#xD;
over the valley-of the Rhine, and many a friend-&#xD;
ly baron sat out to search for him. A week&#xD;
passed away, a month, two months, and all&#xD;
hope of his life departed. All thought that the&#xD;
noble baron of Ehrenstein would never again be&#xD;
found.&#xD;
Yet his mother hoped amidst her sorrow, and&#xD;
vainly tried to imagine - that some accident less&#xD;
terrible than death had befallen her beloved son.&#xD;
But she grew paler and paler, and her heart&#xD;
grew sick with the continuance of this suspense.&#xD;
But there was one whose grief would not be&#xD;
appeased; one whose heart was struck with a&#xD;
heavier and more overwhelming blow. Along&#xD;
the terrace, day after day, for many a long month,&#xD;
Hulda walked, and gazed far away down-the&#xD;
river, as if watching for his return.&#xD;
-Many friends of the afflicted' family came -to&#xD;
offer their condolence, and among them all note&#xD;
-came ftener, or appeared more sympathizing&#xD;
than the'Baron von Feitung. His countenaiee&#xD;
wore a gloomier - expression, as'though sorrow&#xD;
for Hugo's fate oppressed his sopl. - -&#xD;
Hulda received them, but shuddered when-&#xD;
ever'Feitung was'near, as though in him she re-&#xD;
cognized, the' destroyer of her lover.' Often,&#xD;
when' left alone with him in his nu merous visits,&#xD;
she retired *ith-the plea of weakness. Feitung&#xD;
endtired all her coldness with a constancy that&#xD;
was wonderful in him. Yet he could not do so&#xD;
always.&#xD;
Once-she was- about to retir, when Feiting&#xD;
implored her-to stay for one moment. Thinking&#xD;
-tht lierhaps he wouid say something about&#xD;
ingo, she remained.&#xD;
Feittdig spbke in a deep voice, that sho*6d&#xD;
his intense emotion. ~ . '&#xD;
- "Lady julda, 'tis vain to mourn the dead,&#xD;
always. - Count Hugo is dead, 'and peace be to&#xD;
hiis embry. Yet why do you all mour-nsfoi&#xD;
him without ceasing-  A- brave knight is better&#xD;
after death.- Listen: to me. This castle has no&#xD;
lord. Your castle has none but yourself-",&#xD;
"Stop," cried Hulda. -Baron, von Feitung,&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
HVGO VON I&#xD;
my castle and this have owners, who are as ca-&#xD;
pable of defending it as any baron,-when they&#xD;
are surrounded by faithful retainers. Now leave,&#xD;
me, for I must go."&#xD;
"One moment more-O grant me a moment!"&#xD;
cried Feitung, and kneeling before her, he en--&#xD;
deavored to retain her with passionate gestures.&#xD;
But she sprang to her feet, and darting at him&#xD;
a glance of intense hatred and scorn, rushed&#xD;
from the apartment. Feitung rose, and with a&#xD;
fearful expression of vengeance, slowly left the&#xD;
castle, and retired to his home.&#xD;
The beauty of Hulda became less day by day,&#xD;
her strength failed, andalways melancholy, she&#xD;
walked that memorable terrace, or remained&#xD;
within her chamber. Every room, every scene&#xD;
within the. castle was associated with the memory&#xD;
of her lover-and without, the bleautiful scenes&#xD;
on every side spoke only of him. At last, unable&#xD;
to endure such continual sorrow, she sought&#xD;
some release'by absence, and leaving the place&#xD;
where she and Hugo had been so happy, she&#xD;
departed to her own castle.&#xD;
It was situated about ten miles from Ehrep-&#xD;
stein, at a distance from the Rhine, and by situ-&#xD;
ation and fortifications was exceedingly strong.&#xD;
Here her aged seneschal dwelt, and kept it safe&#xD;
from all attacks of hostile bands. In this se-&#xD;
eluded place she hoped to overcome her bitter&#xD;
sorrow, and thought that the distance of those&#xD;
scenes which brought to her the memory of Hu-&#xD;
go would give peace to her mind.&#xD;
Ten monthshad passed away, and Hugo came&#xD;
not. Feitung had been busy with some dark&#xD;
scheme for a long time, and it was noticed that&#xD;
an unusual number of soldiers hovered about his&#xD;
eastle.4&#xD;
One morning, Hulda sat gazing from the bat-&#xD;
tlements of her castle, and looking at the scene&#xD;
which 'lay beneath.  Soon she was aware of&#xD;
a distant noise like the march of a numerous&#xD;
troop. Turning her eyes in that direction, she&#xD;
saw the cause.of the noise. From out a defile, a&#xD;
long and martial procession came winding into&#xD;
the plains below to the sound of the trumpet.&#xD;
The complete armor of the men, and the flags&#xD;
that waved, told of an attacking party. Scarcely&#xD;
had she seen it, when the bell of the castle sound-&#xD;
ed out its alarm. Her soldiers came rushing to&#xD;
the ramparts, arms were collected, and all was&#xD;
made ready for defence.&#xD;
- The- approaching troop halted at a short dis-&#xD;
tance, and a herald came forth bearing the de-&#xD;
vice of the Feitung family. -&#xD;
&#xD;
EHRENFELS.                            '  9&#xD;
"In the name of Waldo, Baron von Feitung,&#xD;
I demand the hearing of the Lady Hulda."&#xD;
" The Lady Hulda hears you," cried the&#xD;
seneschal.&#xD;
" The Baron von Feitung tenders his love and&#xD;
devotion to the Lady Hulda, and lays himself&#xD;
and his castle at her feet."&#xD;
" Tell him," said  Iulda, "that my posses-&#xD;
sions are already largely and-do not want the ad-&#xD;
dition of Feitung."&#xD;
"Then will the noble Lord Waldo, Baron&#xD;
von Feitung, add this castle and the Lady Hal-&#xD;
da to his own."&#xD;
" Let him come and try," cried the stout old&#xD;
seneschal.&#xD;
The soldiers came on to the attack, while those&#xD;
in the castle stood ready to receive them. Large&#xD;
bodies rushed on at every side, bearing scaling&#xD;
ladders, and endeavoring to climb up' the sides.&#xD;
They battered-at thewalls, they thundered at&#xD;
the gates, arrows and darts flew around, and the&#xD;
clash of sword against sword, the clang of spear&#xD;
and shield, resounded on every side, mingled&#xD;
with the shouts of the warring hosts. The strife&#xD;
was kept up through the day with incredible en-&#xD;
ergy. The brave defenders of the castle fell&#xD;
fighting' on every side, but far greater numbers&#xD;
of the enemy were slain.&#xD;
At night the attack ceased, and Feitung, with&#xD;
his men, encamped upon the plain not far&#xD;
away.&#xD;
All were watchful through) that night. The&#xD;
guard was large, and often relieved, for there&#xD;
was much fear of a night attack.&#xD;
/ All, however, was peaceable; button the fol-&#xD;
lowing morning the attack was renewed. Fei-&#xD;
tung came at the head of his men, encouraging&#xD;
them as they came furiously to the strife. On&#xD;
one side, a large body of men with ladders and&#xD;
ropes again endeavored to scale the walls. On&#xD;
another, the soldiers by hovering around, feigned&#xD;
an attack. In another part they undermined the&#xD;
foundation, and sought to make a breach in the&#xD;
massive walls. At the gate, Feitung himself&#xD;
fought, conspicuous by his tall stature and the&#xD;
black plume, of his helmet. The slaughter on&#xD;
both sides was severe opi this day. A large&#xD;
breach was made in the wall, many of the men&#xD;
of Hulda were killed or wounded. The enemy&#xD;
lost men, but on account of their greatly superior&#xD;
numbers,they were better able to bear the loss.&#xD;
Hulda's anxiety was great. In her extremity&#xD;
she could think of only one way of escape, and&#xD;
that was by sending some one to Ehrenstein. for&#xD;
