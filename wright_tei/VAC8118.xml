and usually terminates in war; a result frequently courted&#xD;
wit~r no other view than to school the young warriors, and&#xD;
ajlbrd the older ones opportunities to acquire distinction. These&#xD;
wars are sometimes of short duration; at others they only cease with&#xD;
the extermination, ~or removal 'of one of the parties.&#xD;
When a nation of Indians becomes too numerous conveniently to&#xD;
procure subsistence from its own hunting-grounds, it is no uncommon&#xD;
occurrence for it to send out a colony, or in other words, to separate&#xD;
into tribes, o~ farr~ilies. Thus with the Sioux there are the Brules,&#xD;
iuii~ husband's tribe), the Nordos, Washaukee, Wannie, etc. Prc-&#xD;
paratory to such a measure, runners or spies are sent in various&#xD;
directions to ascertain the most suitable location. A national&#xD;
council next hears the several reports, determines on the plan, and&#xD;
elects chiefs to carry it into operation. The pipe is then sent&#xD;
round, and all who smoke it are considered volunteers. When the&#xD;
number is properly proportioned the ceremony of separation takes&#xD;
place, is at once accomplished, and is truly affeqtiug. The ~ribe s~&#xD;
separated maintains all its relations, independent of the parent&#xD;
nation, though the most friendly intercourse is commonly maintained.&#xD;
and they are almost uniformly allies. Separations sometimes take&#xD;
place from party dissensions, growing generally out of the jealousies&#xD;
of the principal chiefs, and not unfrequently out of petty quarrels.&#xD;
These divisions seldom last long, reconciliation follows~ reflection,&#xD;

aspectrseiae hold of1 and brandish their weajons of war; in precisefr&#xD;
the same manner as ~hpy would do~ if th~y were in his presence, and&#xD;
alk~ut to engage in a~ deadly.eonfiiet. 'J~'he wampum and pipe' are&#xD;
handled in conversations on peacef~al subjects,. and everything con-&#xD;
nected with themes dfameVriealiy reversed.&#xD;
in speaking of men, tame, birds; trees, marching, hunting, swim-&#xD;
mhig, etc., etc., the Indian displays a wonderful power for acting&#xD;
and~ imitating, and the peculiarity of each, individually, is imitated&#xD;
so ha~py'aArnanne~', aS to be readily understood by those ac-&#xD;
quainted ~with'the qualities of the subject intended to be described,&#xD;
although they should be entire strangers to the language.&#xD;
In their writing and correspondence, the Indians make use alto-&#xD;
gether of hieroglyphics. it is doubtM if they had knowledge&#xD;
of methodical combination whether their language would admit of&#xD;
its use. They~ inscribe their correspondence, and such subjects as&#xD;
require to beirecorded; on the inner bark of the white birch; or on&#xD;
skinA prepared~'for the purpose. In~ the' reasoning, th0 judgment&#xD;
snd~ perceptions ,of an Indian are, generally speaking, clear and&#xD;
quick, and their arguments ingenious and c6gent~&#xD;

wire ~ltogecher 'ignorant. it is certain, however, that they acknowV&#xD;
edgej at least SQ far as my acquaintance extends, one supreme, all&#xD;
powerful,. and Intelligent Being; viz, the "Great Spirit," or the&#xD;
Oiver of Life, who created and governeall things.&#xD;
They~believein general, that after th~ htirtting grounds had been&#xD;
fbrmed~ and suppliedd with game, that he created the first red man&#xD;
and woman, who were very h~rge in their stature, and lived to an&#xD;

On the other hand, when in affliction, or suffering under any&#xD;
great calamity, in the belief tuat ii will appease his wrath or miti.&#xD;
~~ate his chastisements, they pray with equal fervency to the Evil&#xD;
Spirit, who, they conceives is a character directly the reverse of the&#xD;
Good Spirit, to whom he is inferior, but, nevertheless, has sufficient&#xD;
powel, and is constantly devising means to torment and punish them.&#xD;
By the term spirit, the Indians have an idea of a being that can, at&#xD;
pleasure, be present, and yet invisible; they nevertheless think the&#xD;
Great Spirit, like themselves, possessed of a corporeal form, though&#xD;
endowed with a nature infinitely more excellent than theirs, and&#xD;
which will endure forever without change. Although they believe&#xD;
in a future state of existence, they associate it with naturaP things.&#xD;
Their "hunting ground" or heaven, they believe, will be a place&#xD;
where game is abundant, and where there ~s perpetual spring and&#xD;
cloudless sky.&#xD;
They expect that their sensual pleasures will be in proportion to&#xD;
individual merit; the brave warrior, expert hunter, and those slain&#xD;
in battle in defence of their country, having the highest claims, will&#xD;
be the most distinguished; while those of subordinate pretensions,&#xD;
will occupy subordinate positions.&#xD;

"What is your name?" I asked.&#xD;
"Deitosie." (The meaning of which is "from the Great Spirit:')&#xD;
"That is a very pretty name, and you are a very pretty girl."&#xD;
"Does my sister think I know not that? Each stream of water&#xD;
i~ell~ me on~, and the SQund of the other is sufficient."&#xD;
"Will Dei~osie walk with me toward my chief's hut?"&#xD;
She consented, and arm in arm we walked toward the centre of&#xD;
the village, where, pointing out a hut, decorated with blankets and&#xD;
buffalo robes, many of which were gorgeou~q painted, she informed&#xD;
me that there I could rest. Accordingly,' after taking a general&#xD;
survey of the interior, I lay 'me down and s6on fell asleep. When&#xD;
I awoke Deitosie stood beside me, and my first glance met her eyes.&#xD;
She smiled sweetly, 'and I arose from my couch.&#xD;
She inquired if I slept well, and on my i~nawering in the affirma-&#xD;
tive, she proposed 'a walk, to which I freely consented. Just as we&#xD;
were about to leave the hut, there entered an old squaw and' a young&#xD;
one about fourteen years of age, I should judge. With merely a&#xD;
glance at them, taking it for granted that one was the' mother, and&#xD;
'the other the sister of Temulle, I followed Deitosie.' We had walked&#xD;
eome distance, when my companiQn turned and asked me to relate&#xD;
'her my history. I did so,' and gradually turned ~ur conversation&#xD;
upon religion. We 'conversed for some time, and I may as well&#xD;
here state that Deitosie bec~rne a devout convert, as did 'also one&#xD;
other Indian maiden, of whom I shall have occasion to hereafter&#xD;
speak. ' '&#xD;
We had walked~ a long way from tile village, when we came to a&#xD;
beautiful mountain patlr. tUp this we went until the summit was&#xD;
reached. Here We 'sat dbwn near the edge of a frightful abyss.&#xD;
Deito~ie related a legend cbnnected with this particular spot.&#xD;
Many ~eat~ ago' an Indian maid~rk Who had married a " Brave,"&#xD;
and by him gi~e~ ~biith to aehild, was in the h~bit of visiting the&#xD;
sp~ot to ~rneet t6~ return of her husband.' Iii the ~mme tribe there&#xD;
was atiother brave who had~ beeh, ~efote" her marriage, very 'per-&#xD;
sistent in his attentions toward her. She did not love Wannotee.&#xD;

which was the name of her re.jeeted lover, and so gave her heart t&#xD;
Surnsumot. - One evening she repaired to the meeting place as&#xD;
usual with her child in her arms. She had been there but a short&#xD;
time, when Wannotee was seen by her coming up the path. There&#xD;
was nothing strange in this, so she paid no attentionn to his approach.&#xD;
In an instant he was by her side, and pouring into her ears such&#xD;
proposals as no squaw who loves her brave would h8'ten to. With&#xD;
lashing eyes she sprang to her feet and demanded his instant do.&#xD;
parture. He merely laughed scornfully, and springing toward her&#xD;
he seized her in his arms. She struggled bravely, but to no pur.&#xD;
pose, as she was b~it ~ child in the iron hands of Wannotee. With&#xD;
a piercing scream, she cried for help. The voice of Sumsumot&#xD;
was heard in response, and crc long he dashed in sight, on the rock&#xD;
directly above them. ~umsumot, in a clear ringing voice, corn.&#xD;
handed his rival to unhand his wife under pain of instant death.&#xD;
For answer Wanuotee shouted, "Fire but one shot, and your squaw&#xD;
and papoose I shall hurl below me." (&#xD;
During this time the Indian wife was making fearKul struggles ~o&#xD;
release herself, and Wannotee was being backed, without knowing&#xD;
it, toward the brink of the frightful abyss. The despair of Suni.&#xD;
sumot who witnessed this scene was terrible. To leave his position&#xD;
on the rock and reach his wife in time to save her fror~i being&#xD;
thrown into the abyss was impossible. To fire was a great risk as&#xD;
he might sho6t his wife or child. He then opened a parley with&#xD;
his fiendish opponent. Wannotee would agree but to one thing-&#xD;
Sumsumot must swear by the Great Spirit to give him his squaw,&#xD;
and take his papoose where he chose. In the agony of despair, at&#xD;
hearing these words, Sumsumot firedupon Wannotee, the shot took&#xD;
effect, and for a moment he relinquished his hold upon the woman,&#xD;
who, terrified beyond description, stood perfectly 5til~, nor made n~&#xD;
effort. to, escape. Wannotee staggered and seemed about to drop&#xD;
dead, when with one last, almost superhuman effort, he sprang&#xD;
towards the Indian woman, seized her in his arms, and with a won.&#xD;
derful leap learned the edge of the abyss. The shoat of Wanx~otee,&#xD;

Afterward, in conversation with 'Deitosie, 'I learned, with feelings&#xD;

I may here remark, that my husband's ~nglish. was not so pure&#xD;
as that of Deitosie. The latter, by the way, was of the Cheyenne&#xD;

During my second I eon~e~sed religiously with all the&#xD;
Indians willing to listen,~o could understand English. My. first&#xD;
attempt was anything but encouraging, and II finally concluded to&#xD;
give it up until I could master the Sioux language. This I did, I&#xD;
may say, easily, and before long I was enabled to offer up prayers&#xD;
to Him who was, I taught them, the Great spirit of all men, women,'&#xD;
and children, no matter what their color might be. My attempts to&#xD;
teach, and reform the Indian children were treated with indifference&#xD;
and contempt, and I may perhaps be allowed some credt, when I&#xD;
assert that I continued under the discouraging auspices nearly one&#xD;
year, and during that time madetwo converts-Deitosie and Winno.&#xD;

braves returned from a hunting expedition, accompanied by a&#xD;
soldier of the U. ~. Army, en cQsturne, whom they bad captured.&#xD;
The br~ye~ reported that he had deserted from his company, and&#xD;
bad for some time past been amusing himself by lying in ambuscade&#xD;
and shooting Indians as they passed. In conversation with hir~i&#xD;
shortly after his arrival, heinforined me that he had received h ~&#xD;
diseharg~, (which he showed me,) and had started home in compare&#xD;
with a party of. hunter, from ~ho1n he became lost. He belonged~&#xD;
to the thirty.second U. S. Iufa~ry~; but I have forgotten his name.&#xD;
The Iadian~ had, without doubt,, confounded him with another&#xD;
man whom he had heard of, and Whe~e name was Fly Jones, but&#xD;
he had gained from the Indians the appellation of "Indiamo Apes"'&#xD;

&#xD;
My sympathies were, of ~ourse, e~teused in this poor man's behalf.&#xD;
But what could I do? A~id yet, perhaps, myhusband might exert&#xD;
his influence for~n~rsake: I includedd to ask him. Te'mulle'~ jeal.&#xD;
ousy was ~ready arousedwhen I appeared before him~and upon my&#xD;
knees besought him~ to plead for the soldier's life. He accused me&#xD;
of wishing the "pale face" to become my lo~'er; and this attempt&#xD;
at the 4'Pocahontas business" ended by my being! placed in the hut&#xD;
under guard of the old hag, and the little child.wife.&#xD;
During the day of the captllre the old hags and boys of the 4i1.&#xD;
lage wei'e permitted to torment the prisoner with taunts, shooting&#xD;
headless arrows at him, sticking him with Indian toy.knives; etc.&#xD;
At night the stake, at which~ he was to be burned, was driven in the&#xD;
ground; and soon after the soldier was brought forward, bound&#xD;
securely, and dry brush heaped around him. Temulle, ina jealous&#xD;
fit, desired tatl should witness the scene. I potested, but to no&#xD;
effect; and was forced to go to the spot. I endeaVored to close my&#xD;
eyes to this dreadful scene, but could not;&#xD;
Once tied to the stake the Indians amused themselves for about&#xD;
an hour, by throwing the tomahawk; the object being to see how&#xD;
near they could come to hitting 'his head-.without touching it.&#xD;
Kone but experts were alloWed to participate in~ this amusement,&#xD;
and their dexterity was truly astonishing. With closed eyes the&#xD;
prisoner stood, and awaited h~s death, for he evidently did not know&#xD;
but what they wex~e trying, in this manner, 'to split his h~dop~iI.&#xD;
T~'is amusement over, the brush was cai'efully ~placed around him.&#xD;
Then the Indians!di'ew lots, but for what, I could not at the trioment&#xD;
perceive. I was not left long in doubt, for the successful Indian&#xD;
stepped out from the circle, and in a ~oment~had completely s~aIped&#xD;
the soldier. At this horrible sight I fainted; and when I revuri~ed&#xD;
to consciousness, the prisoner's body was burned as far up as his&#xD;
chest, and the crisp flesh was rapidly falling into the fire beneath&#xD;
him. Life by this time was extinct; but there, wi$h the;eyes start~&#xD;
ing from their sockets, was his head~ with ghastly appearance, still&#xD;
agt~inst the~ post, his neclc having been securely fastened, This&#xD;
&#xD;
BeCOl)'d awful sight caused another fainting spell, and just before I&#xD;
lost consciousness this time, I cot~d. see the squaws around me, and&#xD;
hear their jeers at the weakness of the sickly pale face squaw.&#xD;
These horrible scenes so worked upon my nerves, that for two&#xD;
days I lay in a helpless condition. During that time I resolved to&#xD;
escape, if a possibility of siich~a feat presented itself. The second&#xD;
day of my illness brought with it a visit from Deitosie, wh&amp;amp; was&#xD;
accompanied by a tall fine looking India~i, whom she P~formed me,&#xD;
(aside,) was thought to be crazy by the Brule tribe; but who, she&#xD;
assured me, was far from being a lunatic. Trouble had brought&#xD;
upon him eccentric manners.&#xD;
After conversing awhile with Deitosie, I opened a correspondence&#xD;
with the young Indian chief, who eventually allowed himself to run&#xD;
into his old train of thoughts, and I finally persuaded him to give&#xD;
me his story of sufferings, adventure, and so3'rc~w, in full, of which&#xD;
I propose making a separate chapter.&#xD;

CHAPTER IV.&#xD;

IN WNIQH WAANATA4 FJLATEB HIS STORY OF STRA~4t ATh DAR-&#xD;
ING A~)YBNTUJ~, EXTREMELY THRILLING IN ITS IWI~URR.&#xD;
Y tribe is that whieb was once known only as the "Dako-&#xD;
tas" but the greater part of which is now termed the&#xD;
Sioux. My people have wronged me greatly, and I shall&#xD;
~ never return to them. My people are mostly what you&#xD;
term Mvages, and many of them are drunkards, the in-&#xD;
fluence of your civilization being forced upon them principally in&#xD;
the shape of~flre.water." To become a chief among the Sioux,&#xD;
one must, at leabt, have scalped a warrior of another tribe, and prove&#xD;
to have done so, by producing the scalp; I was not naturally di~&#xD;
posed to acquire either of these bloody trophies, and consequently&#xD;
.1 was despised as a coward by my j~ple; although I had never&#xD;
shown any fear in fighting or exposing my life, whenever we in-&#xD;
vaded the territory of the Pawnecs, with whom we were constantly&#xD;
in warfare.&#xD;
During one of these expeditions, I ventured myself rather near&#xD;
one of the Pawnee villages, many miles distant from our country,&#xD;
expecting to find an opportunity for some exploit of bravery or&#xD;
skill; which might prove that I was not such a coward as my peo-&#xD;
ple supposed me to be, for none of them had ever gone alone so&#xD;
near, or rather among the Pawnees, being thus exposed to their&#xD;
scalping knife, and full vent of their hatred.&#xD;
Seeing no warrior about the village, that the main body of its&#xD;
warriors Was absent on an excursion; so I laid myself down in an&#xD;
ambush among the bushes, where I waited for some adventure.&#xD;
The great light of the world had already sunk half its way down,&#xD;
when I saw a beautiful P.iwnee girl approaching me, as innocently&#xD;

as a lamb might appr~seh a hidden wolf. I did not etirlrnt let her&#xD;
pass by, while I scarcely breathed for fear I should frighte~i her.&#xD;
As she passed I withdrew a littl~ from my concealment, a~id turning&#xD;
she saw rue. At first she was startled. I arose to my feet; but&#xD;
instead of running away she stood still~ and waited until I had&#xD;
reached her, when she smiled arid said: "Although you are a Sioux,&#xD;
you will neither kill nor strike me; fbr your eyes look mild, and&#xD;
they speak a language which tells me you are good and brave and&#xD;
would not harm rue.'~&#xD;
This confiding address disarmed, rue, and throwing away my&#xD;
weapons to show my friendly int~entious, I said in reply, "Fair&#xD;
maiden, your words are sweet, and your features vie with the&#xD;
brilliance of the morning sun. If I were not aSioux, I would be&#xD;
a Pawnee and hunt for you alone. T&amp;amp;1l rue your name, fair maiden."&#xD;
She looked down and said: "Although you are a Sioux, I like&#xD;
to believe in y~rnr k~endliness, and shall. First tell me your name."&#xD;
"Waanataa I"&#xD;
Thea you are the grandson of the far-fanied chief? Well, my&#xD;
name is Diora, the daughter of Petalso, whom they call the bravest&#xD;
of the braves."&#xD;
"Then," said I, 'KDiora, the daughter of Petalso, is a fit companion&#xD;
for WaanaZaa. Will ~he accompany him as his squaw?"&#xD;
She made answer: "Diora is an oi~phan now. No Pawnee has&#xD;
yet moved her heart. She has seen W4ianataa and will follow, him?'&#xD;
When she concluded I caught her in. my arms, invoking the sanc-&#xD;
tion and iiid of the Great Spirit to our union, and iinswerecl in&#xD;
delight from my soul: "t~iora has p'y heart,. none other shall have&#xD;
my lodge, and for thee alone will 1 hunt the forest game."&#xD;
We then sat dowj and ate togethcr:our first cornzno~neitl, a por-&#xD;
tion of my provisions taken along with me, looking and smiling at&#xD;
each other. Some hours past until we thought of leaving, a diffi-&#xD;

sun became obscured by passing cloud*~ whieh were of a settled&#xD;

MISS I~ARBER'S NARRATIY~.&#xD;
&#xD;
We *Mkod along' swiftly, but iiP'siIence~ until the bright morning&#xD;
stsu' ascended from 'bey6nd the far mountains,' and joy lighted up its&#xD;
face; 4t a welcome to us gave. Suddenly '1 heard a 'distant 'DOISO,&#xD;
and 'before~ long the w&amp;amp;r whoop of the 'Pawn~e rang in our ears.&#xD;
~Diora tr~mbIcd~ and~ exilaim&amp;amp;l.: "Maekatana~Namake~'! (Black&#xD;
Thunder.) Hi~ band, they are 'going'to'invade' your countryy!" I&#xD;
tried4tki ~oothe my frightened dove, Who now ir~formed me, ~n a few&#xD;
'words, tha~ she had son~tinie ago refused to become the squaw of&#xD;
Black Thunder, the leader of the body of Pawnee now approaching.&#xD;
I had' ulinost' gi~'en up in dea6~ir, when, to my greav surprise and&#xD;
intense gr~tification, 1 beheld three horses, caparisoned with Pawnee&#xD;
saddlu~s, tied~ t~trees'4 directly in front of us. Without si~opping to&#xD;
inquire 'fok~ their owners, I hastily seated Diora on one, mounted&#xD;
myself upoxk another, and with a joyful heart urged them onward.&#xD;
The ~wiftness4 and strength of 'our noble~ horses 'couhi 'alone saVe us&#xD;
from destruction' at the hands of Black Thunder, whose vengeance&#xD;
would thus be doubly satisfactory, on account of rejected love and&#xD;
of national hatred.' But 1 was resolved that he should neither cap-&#xD;
ture1Dy~ bi'ide, nor dauce round my scalp'; and we dashed along at&#xD;
a wonderful speed, for of noble blood our suddenly acquire4 horses&#xD;
proved."       4         444' 4&#xD;
Thus we' flew o'er the 'ground, followed closely by Black Thunder,&#xD;
who had now obtained a sight of us. On, on, we went, the demon&#xD;
Pawnee~and his baud following like a gloomy ckftid chased by winds,&#xD;
whose howhingwas more than outdone'by the dreadful war whoop of&#xD;
our fierce pursuers. Two of my pursuers were greatly in advance of&#xD;
the others. When the foremost got near enough, he fired his rifle at&#xD;
but in vain. I then wielded~ and stepped my horse, aimed and&#xD;
fir~d~ whereupon. my would-be assassin fell 'from 'hie horse, dead;&#xD;
but in the meantime the other Fawne~ had reached to Within aiming&#xD;
distance,' when he too fired upon us, but luckily without"~ffect. He&#xD;
still ~ushed'forward however, and seeing that we were likely to end&#xD;
this scene by a4~hand.to4~nd encounter, '41' dismounted, giving' my&#xD;
hirse'a re1u/t~ Diore~'whom I 'bade hold' fast and remain near me.&#xD;

her o~ice lovel features brightened 'th&#xD;
wi a smile: which in it&amp;amp;very&#xD;
brought&#xD;
e9ming~ with it the old, handsome expression, and she&#xD;
whisered~ "Dear Waanataa~ you have come. at last, ~s come I knew&#xD;
you woi~4 but we must now part forever, the Great Spirit has&#xD;
called me~ but he has been very good to me, for he denied me not&#xD;
yo.lr presence in my last momentss." I tried to close her mouth&#xD;
with a kiss while thus she spoken and with that kiss a rivulet of&#xD;
tears, flowed, which ,seemed to bear upon the bosom of its waters&#xD;
~iiy very heart, it~ agonizing grief, thus floating on toward the bridge&#xD;
of' wrecked despair.&#xD;
"I~ar Diora," I managed to utter between my sobs of grief, "you&#xD;
are v9ry weak and irnist not talk1 let me first give you drink, and&#xD;
then prepare you nourishing food." I fetched some water in a&#xD;
leather cup from our little spring, poured it over a handful of meal,&#xD;
stirred it up with maple sugar, the two mixed with the leaves of&#xD;
some berries growing near by, and presented it to my poor Diora,&#xD;
who, with the natural, se1f-denyin~ love of a tender mother, gave her&#xD;
of&#xD;
starving baby first to drink, before she thought partaking herself;&#xD;
while I knelt and wept, unable to further speak.&#xD;
My efforts were all in vain; I could not save the lives of my&#xD;
dear ones! The Great Spirit claimed them as his own. At the set.&#xD;
ting sun the star of my life lost its light, became extinguished; and&#xD;
in no presence, save, that of the Great Spirit, I stood alone beside&#xD;
the dead!&#xD;
When my companions, after continuing their journey in the&#xD;
~noon'p light, reached d      now a vault of death, they found&#xD;
me sitting and weeping beside, the inanimate bodies of her whom I&#xD;

open air, I buried the bodies of my gear &amp;amp;hes in the cave, wbi~e1i&#xD;
thus became a real vault of death. After the burial I remember&#xD;
no subsequent events until two moons had passedwhen waking from&#xD;
my long fevered sleep, I found myself once more among the Fox&#xD;
and Sacs tribes. As soon as I regained sufficient strength I de.&#xD;
parted, refusing all proffers of friendship; and for many moons I&#xD;
roamed far and wide, until I at length arrived among the Brule-&#xD;
Sioux, with whom I have since remained. But sorrow sits deep&#xD;
upon my soul, life has no allurements for me, for I know not where&#xD;
o turn.&#xD;
"Perhaps, dear Wazora" (my Indian name), said Waauataa, as he&#xD;
included his narrative," perhaps my story has tired you?"&#xD;
"Oh, no," I, answered, "it has proved very interesting to me, and&#xD;
deeply syrnpa~hize, with you in your great sorrow."&#xD;
Waanataa thanked me and withdrewfrom thelodge. Deitosie&#xD;
md I remained in conversation for some time afterward, when she&#xD;
~oo left me. Shortly after her departure little Leeoj~oge (Tem'mll~s&#xD;
goring squaw) entered, and we were soon conversing in quite an&#xD;
animated and friendly manner; in fact Leeonoge and I had been&#xD;
good friends from our first acquaintance. What was my surprise&#xD;
~o learn from her lips that Temxille intejided, that very day, to take&#xD;
unto himself another squaw. Soon w~ heard the Indian drums beat,&#xD;
and sounds of "Kee.wan-ah "wer~' yelled, by hundreds of voices.&#xD;
With difficulty I almost dragged myself to the entrance of the lodge,&#xD;
~nd there' for the first time witnessed an Indian marriage.&#xD;
The young Indians are led, both by precept and e~arnple, to&#xD;
adopt the married life; and instances of celibacy very.ra~ely continue,&#xD;
more particularly ~on the part 9f males, much beyond the period of&#xD;
mature puberty, Old bachelors, settled i~thcir towns and villages,&#xD;

&amp;amp;, few who 19d a wandpPng life, sometimes att~c~4ng4hen~elves to&#xD;
~ne tribe, and sometimes ~to another.&#xD;
Early marriages are more frequent in tribes bordering on the white&#xD;
settlements than n those which are more remotely situated; and the.&#xD;

practice is encouraged by th~ old men, who however say that when&#xD;
they were voting they did n~t marry, nor even think of'being called&#xD;
tuen, unti1~tweuty winters had passed over their heads. The inter.&#xD;
course with whites, they maintain, has enervated the warriors,&#xD;
caused the Indians to be more indolent, quarrelsome, and wicked;&#xD;
and materially shortened the period of their existence.&#xD;
On the occasion of ~DenUmlle's marriage to his fourth wife, he walked&#xD;
~najestically 'towai~d ~hc north first, and then successively toward&#xD;
the Fla~t South, and West. During this time the horrible drums&#xD;
were fiercely beaten, yells were heard on all sides, and great excite-&#xD;
~ie1it appeared~ ~o prevail. Then came sileimce, a~~d with it the squaw&#xD;
to whom he was to be married, and who reali~ wss~ far from being an&#xD;

b~g he~ steps about haW ~thc Way, halted, and taking an ear of corn&#xD;
from beneath the folds of h~r dress; "deposited it upon the ground.&#xD;
Temulle~then Walked forward, picked up the ear of corn, and amid&#xD;
furious Jells, threw it far above him. This si~imified an acceptance.&#xD;
She we~it immediately up to him and seized his right wrist, and&#xD;
said: "Meemole is' proud, happy, humble, and will do all work for&#xD;
the great chief Temimile." He then, in a load voiOe, candidly pro-&#xD;
claimed th&amp;amp; warm attachment he entertalimed for Meemole, widow&#xD;
of Stameollo the warrior~ 'and at th4 same time presented her with&#xD;
the heart of an elk (as I afterward learfled), a buffalo ~obe, and, to&#xD;
my astonishmeiit, a g~Ad chain and locket, which I had worn&#xD;

A&#xD;
E1~[OIJE, widow of StameoUo, brought an addition into tho&#xD;
1     family besides herself. This addition was in the shape of&#xD;
a nine-year-old boy, who then and 'in after years proved&#xD;
one of my greatest v~rmtmtors. For instance, he would,&#xD;
instigated by l~is mnqth9r, plane himself in a favorable&#xD;
position, and, the~i with ~hjs toy' bc"w ~d arrows (a 'very uncivilized&#xD;
specie of toy II may here remark), he would aim at any portion of&#xD;
my limbs which might accidentally bec~m~e exposed while I attended&#xD;
to cooking and Qther domestic arrangements. I did not dare 'te&#xD;
retaliate, for such a proceeding would not have been tolerated bt&#xD;
either his mother or step-father.~ Temulle had, since his marriage&#xD;
with Meemole become a perfect tyrant, and I rcsolv~d to escape if&#xD;
possible. I gave tip in despair being ever able to accomplish good&#xD;
in a'missionary point Qf view, and therefore my 'religious views did&#xD;
not deter me fv~zna ~ed determination toitnmediately attempt the&#xD;
step.&#xD;
But, in the midst of thoughts of escape, a serious accident occurred t~&#xD;
me which bade fair to pi~t an end to my lease of life. Whilst stand~&#xD;

felt ~1co1&amp;amp;subst~nce ne~t the flesh of my leg, and~,jumpinjg from t1i~~&#xD;

At first I was thankful for my escape from the venomous bite of&#xD;
the reptile; but suddenly X f~lt'a stinging sensation; and upon exami&#xD;

forward he reached the rattlesnake, with one blow of tomahawk&#xD;
severed its head from its body, and quickly commented skinning&#xD;
and cutting it to pieces~&#xD;
Meanwhile, from fright, I Jay $?nseles~. The squaws in the village&#xD;
soon gained intelligence of the occurrence, ana were seen running&#xD;
~bo~t, ~nd swoopingng now and then; bat Deitosie had not. been idle,&#xD;
and was soon by n~y side, and with her a utensil, formed of buffalo&#xD;
bide, containing water and two or three handfuls of green leaves of&#xD;
a peculiar virtue. Meantime Waanataa had been busily ehgaged in&#xD;
placing upon the rattlesnake's bite the innet~ parts of the sliced&#xD;
pieces of its body. Each slice, upon being applied to the wound&#xD;
would 'almost immediately turn black; and just as Waanataa was&#xD;
about removing ~'thixkl piece L awoke. This sli'c~ was' only black&#xD;
to asmall extent, &amp;amp;~nd th~is proved that the pbisoti '~ra~ nearly all&#xD;
extracted. . ~&#xD;
~During the apPlication Deitosie had poured down my 'throat the&#xD;
potion she 'haU ~prepared, 'and afterwards she bathed my liriib with&#xD;
it.' I recovered; but my nerves undergoing another severe shock, II&#xD;
was again prostrated. Old Babasho, Temulle's eldest w ~fe, in con-&#xD;

There occurred, however, about this 'time, an event which turned&#xD;
my thoughts back ag~iin in their o34 direction. This event was the&#xD;
appearance among us of an old kfeth&amp;amp;dist' j~i'eacher, named Joba&#xD;
Mailer, a. native of New York State, and a reside~i't 'of New York&#xD;

$aer was a sort ~f indepen~lei~it trader, 'and remained with us&#xD;

leaves which- Deitosie had ue*d 'as a remedy. Maer. 'expressed a&#xD;
great desire to gather some, in' which' M~. MadI~r also joined.'&#xD;
Deito~ie,' who was 'present, volunteered'd toi ~how theifr a' spot, but&#xD;
a short distance from the village, where they 'grew in 'abundance.&#xD;
T~nulle had been absent some two or'three days, and' not fearing his&#xD;
-displeasure, I also volunteered to a~pompany the party. The moon'&#xD;
shone brightly that night, as we set forth' upon' our bota~i~al trip.&#xD;
We had preceded something over half a mile 'from 'the '4tillage,&#xD;
when, qui~ as thought; Maer with a funous blow~ struck Mr. Mad-&#xD;
lerto th&amp;amp; ground, and turning 'dealt Deitosie one equally as hard.&#xD;
Before I could gather' .mysenses he 'had eonipletely:'enveloped my&#xD;
head and shoulders in his eloak, thus stifling a11 ~cries for help;&#xD;
which I might have given vent to. Seizing me in his strong 'arms&#xD;
he ran quickly forward. I heard the neighing. of a horse near by, and&#xD;
soon 'feW myself lifted~ upon ~ita back, and knew that Maer wa~ there&#xD;
beside me. The villain had 'planned the whole affair, and soon the'&#xD;
horse Was galloping on at a pushed speed. '. My thoughts 'during&#xD;
this time were of an unenviable kind. 'What object' could he have&#xD;
in this' abduction ~? Madman, did he not' realize that we should&#xD;
soon be pursued- and overtaken. ' " ' " ' I&#xD;
'We had probably gone some~tenior fifteenmiles' before he reined&#xD;
i~p. fl&amp;amp; dismounted and', lifted me from the'horse~ back. Then a&#xD;
&#xD;
75&#xD;
&#xD;
long silence ensued, which was at length broken by shouts front&#xD;
Maer, and sounds of a switch descending upon the back of the' horse,&#xD;
a neigh of terror froui the animal, and then as' 'of some' heavy body&#xD;
rolling down a ravine,&#xD;
The cloak was then withdrawn from my head, and 'I in a half in-&#xD;
sensible manner regained my power of speech, and l'5oked around&#xD;
rue. There stood M'aer with the face of a demon, his eyes bloodshot,&#xD;
and a ghastly smile on his unprepossessing countenance~&#xD;
"You' are now the wife of Maer.' Do you not comprehend me?"&#xD;
he said:&#xD;
I could make no reply~         - ~.&#xD;
"You don't mind it, eh? Good 1' 'Well, I wilt tell you some-&#xD;
thing. In a short time those red-skin devils will be upon us. Ar.&#xD;
driving at this' 'spot they will~ notice soniethin~ unusual,' and will&#xD;
trace that something to the edge of this ravine, down which 'I caused&#xD;
my horse to leap.' They' will 'suppose' ua to have b~eu: on the horse&#xD;
when he went down. Nov, in order to reach the bottom, they will&#xD;
be obliged to i'etraOe their steps home eight milea. 'During that&#xD;
time, and that which we' 'haVe' 'gained in 'advance bf them, we can&#xD;
walk a little ways-~---ean't' we, my dear?' and after we do' walk a little&#xD;
ways I knoW a 'nice little hiding place. Now aint I a schemer?&#xD;
It's all for you, tool"&#xD;
The villain evidently considered' that I did not object 'to his plans,'&#xD;
aVid knowing my helplessness, I' concluded for the present not to&#xD;
un~leceive him. So on we went., until we arrived at the banks of a&#xD;
sm'~lt stream. Before emerging from the woOds, Maer removed his&#xD;
nioccasons and de.~ired me to do the same. 'He then procured four&#xD;
large pieces of wanton bark. ' TWo of thes6 pieces he tied to his&#xD;
feet;' one under each"foot. The other two pieces he tied to 'mine.&#xD;
We then' started for the stream; after reaching which we untied&#xD;
our "bark shoes,"' and walked dOwn th'e brook.&#xD;
Ho* far We walked I 'have ho ideM; but at last in an exhausted&#xD;
condition; 'my feet badly'sw6llen; we' re~he&amp;amp; a hut, or lodge, of&#xD;

mind, awaited my fate~ In. the mid8t of such. thoughts II was&#xD;
aroused by ,a great splaphing sound, and turning found myself in&#xD;
the avrns of' Maer. Ris face was covered with blood, and front a&#xD;
hole in his forehead the blood, was slowly, trickling down. His ,ex~&#xD;
pressing I shall never fQrget, as with an oath he seized me, and&#xD;
hissed into my ear these ,words&#xD;
"You thought to escape me, my beauty, did you? BQt I have&#xD;
you no~y~r, despite ~he endeavor~ of that chanting preacher to trick&#xD;
me of my prize. ,, Curs~ him! lie 'shall pay for every drop 01&#xD;

quickly followed.. As I gained my feet upon the floor of the cabin&#xD;
I beheld Deitosie, who was about to spring forward to meet me~&#xD;
when seeing the head and shoulders o~' Maer emerging from the&#xD;
cave, she darted toward him instead, and seizing him dragged him&#xD;
through, and administer a sound beating to his Qanadian. majesty.&#xD;
But once, firmly upon his feet he would have proved too much for&#xD;

were burned to death.&#xD;
Not loDg after this terrible affair, two white girls were brought to&#xD;
Qurvillage, and forced to take braves as husbands or die at the stake.&#xD;
From them I learned a sad history of Indian cruelties. Their name&#xD;
w'asHowso*~. Three yea~s pi~evious the father, John W. Howson,&#xD;
~nd his wi~' a~id thi~ children, from Kentucky, i~ad sought and&#xD;
eound a home in the far West. Everything had prospered, and in&#xD;
their happy home few thoughts of evibcaine. 1~ut the destroyer&#xD;
was .on theh tracl~. Ou~ ~day there came se~~en Indians who&#xD;
&#xD;
exhibited every sign of peaceable intentions. They asked for food&#xD;
and received it. After stuffing themselves to their hearts' content*&#xD;
they asked for fire~water. Mr. llowson and his wife, who were&#xD;
both in the house,~informed them that he had none, in fact never&#xD;
used it.&#xD;
"White man lie!'? said one of the Lndians, "and me kill him, he,&#xD;
no give us fire.water."&#xD;
Mr. Howson still persisting that there was nothing of that, kind&#xD;
in the house, the Indiansriished upon; and struck him to the ground,&#xD;
where they scalped him aflve before the ey~ of' his distracted family.&#xD;
Mrs. ll~wson, an iri~alid, utiable' to move from her~haiiVsat wring.&#xD;
ing h&amp;amp;i~ hands an~l balling for mercy. Th~ Thdians, now 'thoroughly&#xD;

toward a~bojr of a1~out t4Our years of age, and' one t~tll po~verfuI brute&#xD;
took him by the heels and dashed his brains out a~aifist the door-&#xD;

sight, and when they became consciotis their home was in ash~sand&#xD;
their m6~her' buried beneath. The Thdians who eomriiitted 'this&#xD;
dastardly deed were of the L6 tribe, but they brought their captives&#xD;

on, knowing not what w*~s before us. At any moment We rtiight be&#xD;
plunged down some~ deep abyss. Oh, it was terrible, but there was&#xD;
no help for it, so on; on we went.&#xD;
We had traversed the cavern a great while when we suddenly&#xD;

we went, and after walking'qnite a distance came to a hole scarcely&#xD;

out far, en~ugh~ to take;a view of its surroundings, when with feelitigs&#xD;

Z             rushing down the ~rocks, which I badbefore seen in' the other cavern.&#xD;

But joy! joy, to. the left of me I saw a ledge of rock upon which we,&#xD;
with care, c&amp;amp;uld~ crawl. I told Deitosie of my disco~'ery, and crawled&#xD;
out, followed snon after by my companion. .&#xD;
The rdek~upon~rbieh 4eatood was some on&amp;amp; hi~udred audI fifty&#xD;
or two hundred feet above the plain beneath us. Deitosie, after&#xD;
walking around sometime, came to me with the i~iews that to the&#xD;
left of us~*as a natural path b~ which we could descend.&#xD;

wera on their way, with supplies, to Fort Berthaid, and wished to&#xD;
stop ~t the Th'ule village. I did not like to own that I was then&#xD;
attempting to escape from my husband, and therefore, after ttgain&#xD;
repeating my warning, at which they onlylaughed, I left them to go&#xD;
their way, They had been gone about half an hour when who should&#xD;
suddenly appear before us but Temulle. The game was up! It&#xD;
had been fairly played, but our antagonist held the winning card.&#xD;
Without a word Temulle pointed toward the Brule village, and I.&#xD;
in company with my cotnpanioi~, led the way, followed closely by&#xD;
Ternulle.&#xD;
Arrived at the village, we were haii~d ~by the. Indians with all&#xD;
sorta of exclamations, and I was glad to get into the lodger to escape&#xD;
their~taunts. But my trouble was by no means at~an end. Temuile&#xD;
walkedin soon after and whipped me so severely that I expected&#xD;
nothing short of death to ensue. Not content with this be pounded&#xD;
me with his fists, until, overcome by suph treatment, I' fainted. Nor&#xD;
was thisall, for in the morning I awoke to learn that the council,&#xD;
ther~ more than half crazy with liquor, had condemned me to be&#xD;
burned at the stake.&#xD;
All my tChristian fortitude was required to bear up under the~~e&#xD;
trials.&#xD;
The time appointed for the sacrifice, as the Indians termed it,&#xD;
arrived, and with trembling limbs, but ~ strong faith in God, I&#xD;
walked forth to meet my doom. Tied to the ttake I waited the sig-&#xD;
nal that would stai~t the flames around ~me. The sky was dark&#xD;
with clouds, heavy winds were blowing,.when suddenly vivid flashes&#xD;
of lightning illumined the heavens above. Wadnataa now appeared&#xD;
upon the scene, and addressed the Indians. He bade them beware&#xD;
~ th~ Great SpiritYs wrath. They were about to burn a woman who&#xD;
hud nev4 harmed them, and the~ Great Spirit would talk to them.&#xD;
As he spoke a loud peal of thunder rent the air, and the Indians&#xD;
dropped as if struck by some unseen power. There I stood a wit.&#xD;
ness. to this sc0ne of so much import to myself.&#xD;
The ek'z*xents were ndw let loose hi all their fury1. The wind blew&#xD;
&#xD;
a p&amp;amp;ecthurrieane, p~al ~ftor peal. crashed as. if in contention with&#xD;
some~ great ~nt~gouist,..and the Vividness of the. lightning clea4~~&#xD;
exposed each okjeet to vieW, when suddenly the. earth trembled;&#xD;
then ,sho0k and abook again, till with one mighty heave it seemed&#xD;
to throw off all the weight upon it, and the next flash of lightning&#xD;
showed the laud not far off, to be 8plit as far as the eye could reach.&#xD;
During these events Waanataa could be seen standing erect, calm&#xD;
and collected.&#xD;
Presently the storm abated, and Waanataa walked up to the&#xD;
stake and severed the cords which bound me, and then, turning to&#xD;
the Indians, huddled together like sheephe said:&#xD;
"Sioux, the Great $pirit has spoken, and do you not know what&#xD;
the lightning was saying ?'"&#xD;
After the 8tOrJTk had passed over I went to my lodge, arid there&#xD;
offered up' a prayer of thanksgiving for my rescue from destth.&#xD;
Temulle, for some time subsequently, treated me with great res-&#xD;
~ect, as did also the rest af the tribe, but this soon wore off, and&#xD;
again did I submit to seemingly never-ending persecutions.&#xD;
The following day a white man approached the village on horse.&#xD;
back, and informed us that he was one of a party eti route for Fort&#xD;
Berthald. Ha it was with whom I .l{ad conversed and warned not&#xD;
to enter the~ Brule village.&#xD;
After great parley he was ordered to bring his companions before&#xD;
the chief, and accordingly did so,' when commenced a general massa-&#xD;
cre, only one of the party' escaping to tell the tale.&#xD;
Things in the neighborhood were getting too hot for a longer&#xD;
stay on, the part of the Sioux, and owing to' the late murders and&#xD;
depredations, they knew that the pale-faces would soon be on the trail&#xD;
as a~ angers, and consequently after a council had been held, it was&#xD;
agreed that the best policy would be to "pull up stakes" and&#xD;
leave.&#xD;
T'~e ladians generally act upon impulse, and in a short time our&#xD;
tribe was on the move, and the deserted village lay far behind. For&#xD;
days w~ travelled, and I, the "noble Indian's wife," was obliged to&#xD;

Several indians now stePped forward and separated us, and we were&#xD;
eoinrrianded to stand upon our feet; whieb w~did, and having learned&#xD;
a lesson from ~fcemole at the eomn~eneement of the encounter, t pro-&#xD;
ceeded immediately to put it to practical, use, and this time it was&#xD;
her turn to receive the cut upon the face.&#xD;
The quickness with which: I accomplished this served to call forth&#xD;
the applause of the drunken Indians, and Meemole in no mannerr&#xD;

cutting atid slashing at' each other in a manner which appeared to be&#xD;
terrible, but which was in reality of no great effect, except to start&#xD;
a considerable ~quantity of blood. Temulle at last, seeing that I was&#xD;
getting the best of the squaw, ordered us to be separated. Again&#xD;
we st6od face to face, and a sorry appearance we must have presented.&#xD;
Meeniole had decidedly the worst of it, but her courage was by no&#xD;

She lost no time in acting on the offensive,, and it wae with great&#xD;
'di1~culty that I avoided several savage thrusts, any o~ of which, I&#xD;
doubt not, would have proved fatal to my. existence; Many times&#xD;

I~band handed me over to Mackainoze, the old Brule chief, whi&#xD;
that very day set o~it for a neighboring tribe, a~c~mpanied by at'&#xD;
~' Anee" friend. I bade good bye to Deitosie, Waaiiataa and Little&#xD;
Leeonoge(thelatter wa~ theg inadyingc&amp;amp;ndition), and followed my new&#xD;
"proprietor." Daniel Leroy, the old hunter, did not even some for&#xD;
ward to bid me farewell, but kept decidedly aloof.&#xD;
We had been on our way two days, and had probably travelled&#xD;
some forty odd miles when we struck asmallstreani called the "Naog"&#xD;
(roaring) brook. MackanIo~6 expressed it as his intex~t~on to remain&#xD;
here soixte three or four day~. We had scarcely been npou the spot&#xD;
selected, an honk' when Daniel Leroy rode up, having the three ponies&#xD;
given Temulh~ by the old ehief, with him. He entered intO ~$ O*~:&#xD;
versation with Maekamo7~e, the substance of ~hieh was that he4esire4&#xD;
to buy me back. ]~e offered the three ponies and other parent~&#xD;
and promised the old chief" much money" if he would ~e~Iomp5fly&#xD;
us to one of the forts after the trade.&#xD;
Nothing h6wever would induce Mackamoza to trade for me, and he&#xD;
and the other Indian took possession of the three po~iies and badet~&#xD;
hunter leave them in~tan$ly under pain of death. They aseerted that&#xD;

Q~S~V4TI~f5 QI~ INDIAN PRACTiCE OF MEDICINE-MANNER OF&#xD;
TM~T~-'-INPIAN REUBS, ETC., WITH T~AN5LATIONS-RJCCEIPTS&#xD;
FOR VARIOUS DISEASE~-NEVER KNOWN TO FAIL.&#xD;
~ HAVE, since 'my return, been importuned by numerous friends&#xD;
aid acquaintances, to give to the public some of the receipts&#xD;
~ in use among the Indians, fvr the cure of diseases. The pub-&#xD;
lishers of this work, knowing the great value of these receipts,&#xD;
gladly publish, them, and will fully indorWe their efficacy. T&#xD;
aim confident that the reader will do well' to preserve the receipts,&#xD;
as, where they have been properly applied, I have never, in one&#xD;
Instance, known them to fail.&#xD;
In the spelling of the Indian names I use a system of my own,&#xD;
which is to spell words according to their sound in pronouncing-&#xD;
t~iem. My translations may be thoroughly relied upon as being&#xD;
accurate.&#xD;
FROSTED MEMBERS.-The Indians make a ,plaster of the re8i,~&#xD;
of 8ap-pzfle, which has a soothing effect, and removes all irrita-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
CHOLERA MORBUS.-Make a gruel of Waslo-nee (rice) and a tea&#xD;
~f' Han-to-la (liquorice). Then get a small quantity of Nec-char-jo&#xD;
(red raspberry leaves), and make a strong tea, which must be given&#xD;
to patient half a glassful every hour, or oftener, according to severity&#xD;
of the case.&#xD;
The red raspberry leaves are excellent in stopping looseness&#xD;
of the bowels, but care should be taken not to stop the ~looseness&#xD;
suddenly. -&#xD;

caustic with great sMecess. It is highly useful in the treatrnen,~W&#xD;
fistulas, also in indolent ulcers of every kind. It&#xD;
removes jUia.gous&#xD;
flesh without exciting any inflammation, and acts but little, except. on&#xD;
spongy or soft flesh. It is useful in cancers, and in every case WLUt&#xD;
a caustic is required.&#xD;

&#xD;
GAftGL~.-Take Sa-inoon (sage), 1 ounce; Rave-o-ee (hyssop),&#xD;
1 ounce ; pour on one quart of boiling water, and let it stand&#xD;
half an hour, then strain, and add 1 drachm~ of fine borax. Use.-&#xD;
This g&amp;amp;rgle is usefully employed by the Sioux~ tribe in aphth~,&#xD;
and in quinsy or sore throat, particularly 'where there is acute&#xD;
inflammation.&#xD;
GARGLE FOR PUTRID SORE TnROAT.~Gee.SUmach (bark of&#xD;
upland sumach); Lsee.lo.we.nee (high blackberry); Alp-as~ter (com-&#xD;
mon white elm bark); Alo.o-e~oh (white oak bark); Was-char-ee&#xD;
(small black snakeroott; Sum-me, ab-ab (nanny berry baW). Take&#xD;
of each a handful, except the snake.root, which mu~ be only half&#xD;
the quantity; make a strong decoctiou, add a piece of alum, and&#xD;
sweeten well with honey, then bottle for use. Apply often to&#xD;
the sores with a rag. It m~y at first irritate a little, but then cures.&#xD;
I have seen hundreds cured by this gargle where all other means&#xD;
were of no avail., In place of alum the Indians use a peculiar kind&#xD;
of grass, but the alum I know to be an excellent substitute from&#xD;
experience.&#xD;
INFU5IO~5..-Infu8ions, or, as they are usually called, teas, are ~&#xD;
very common and good method used by the Indians, of administer-&#xD;
ing the virtues of various medical agents. A two-fold benefit is&#xD;
derived from infusions: 1st, the medicinal properties of the article&#xD;
made use of; 2dly, the heat and diluent properties of the water.&#xD;
During the year of my return (1872), which will be long remem-&#xD;
bered as one of epidemics, and general sickness, my success among&#xD;
my friends and acquaintances, in the treatment of various diseases,&#xD;
was so great that I was frequently urged by them to practise&#xD;
medicine professionally; and by the use of herb teas this success was&#xD;
accomplished.&#xD;
An excellent method to make teas or infusions is to put the plant&#xD;
or root into a tea-pot, pour on boiling water, and let it stand a short&#xD;
time by the side of the fire. In this way the infusion is readily made&#xD;
very clear. For infusions generally, put a handful of the herb&#xD;
into a tea-pot, and add a quart of boiling water; when cool, drink&#xD;
freely.&#xD;
For kidney complaint an excellent tea can be made of Tat-ta-loo&#xD;
'(leabane)&#xD;

powder which 'they manufacture from laurel leaves,' but as I do not&#xD;
kIw)w th~ formula, and do know the bet~efieitd effect of cream of&#xD;
tartar, V advise the use of the latter.&#xD;
Dose.-A wine glassful every hour till it purges.&#xD;

I&#xD;
Co~9N ?oui~TIc~.-.~Take of slippery elm, bark (pulverized) a&#xD;
sufficient quantity; stir it in hot or warm milk and water, to the&#xD;
consistence of a poultice. This poultice exceeds every other in&#xD;
point of ef~acy~ It i~ of almost universal application, and removes&#xD;
inf~amn~at~on ~oo~pr than any other. Compared to this, every other&#xD;
poultice dwindles into insignificance.&#xD;
I will nere add a bit of useful information not of Indian origin,&#xD;
but o~e~'f great l~euefit to suffering humanity. In scarlet fever,&#xD;
measles, whooping cough, and small pox (and all kindred diseases),&#xD;
give freely of brewer's yeast. Its eftbct is wonderful, the disease&#xD;
is forced out, and all fe~rs of sore throat may be discarded where&#xD;
the yeast is given. In small pox, a regulation of the bowels, use&#xD;
of the yeast, and good, careful nursing (the room, in which the&#xD;
a&#xD;
patient is placed, to be kept of an even temperature), will do more&#xD;
thaA all the doctors to be had. The patient's diet in this disease&#xD;
should consist chiefly of gruels, and warm teas should be frequently&#xD;
given. Take of saffron and catnip equal parts, make a tea, and&#xD;
give it warm. Use the fever remedies when fever appears.&#xD;
Bost nourishment for the disease is barley w~~'r, Indian meat&#xD;
gruel, buttermilk and water, roas~d apple.% and &amp;amp;'~ ;'uit moderately.&#xD;
* Let there be a current of air in the roo ~ avoid the same&#xD;
coming in contact with tjie patient. Great attention must be paid&#xD;
to cleanliness.' Change linen and clothes often. If eruptions are&#xD;
large, full of water and irritating, puncture same, and sprinkle same&#xD;
with dry flour of slippery elm, and the pitting of the face will be&#xD;
greatly diminished.&#xD;
In conclusion allow me to assure the reader that all the fore.&#xD;
going receipts are of great value, and may be fully relied upon.&#xD;
When you ~o to the druggist be particular to write the exact&#xD;
qu~intity as given by me, and make use of the Engli8h name, only,&#xD;
as very 'few druggists have any knowledge of the Indian languages.&#xD;
