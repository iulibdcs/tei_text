            <div type="chapter">
               <head>I. THE DOCTOR.</head>
               <p>A MAN was sitting in a house on Gloucester Street, in Williamsburg, Virginia,
                  about a hundred years ago, busy at a very singular employment.</p>
               <p>In this lower world the inner character of men and things connects itself so
                  mysteriously with their outward appearance, that a pen-and-ink sketch is desirable
                  of the room in which the personage we have introduced was sitting, and of the
                  personage himself.</p>
               <p>It was the front apartment of a small house, standing somewhat back from the
                  street, in the midst of a small garden, given up chiefly to flowers; and, as the
                  season was autumn, the borders burned with prince's-feathers, asters, yellow
                  primroses, and late geraniums. You approached by a gravel-walk, mounted two stone
                  steps, entered by a heavy door, ornamented with an enormous brass lock, and,
                  passing through an inner door on the right, found yourself in the apartment
                  mentioned. It was half sitting-room, half laboratory. A thick carpet, with
                  lozenge-shaped figures of black and red alternately, covered the floor, and some
                  old, high-backed chairs rested against the dingy walls. In one corner was a
                  walnut-wood bookcase, containing an array of volumes, chiefly upon medical
                  subjects, and these had overflowed upon the chairs and the carpet. On the tall
                  mantel-piece were jars, phials, retorts, and bones. It was plain that physiology
                  was a favorite study of the owner of the mansion; and specimens of the
                  master-worm, man, in every stage of his physical development, from the embryo to
                  the skeleton, dangling its legs and arms, and grinning frightfully, met the eye on
                  every hand.</p>
               <p>In the centre of the room stood a long table, covered with machines and retorts.
                  Beside it, poring, with knit brows, over a large leather-bound volume, and
                  looking, from moment to moment, at a white rabbit under a glass cover, sat the
                  master of the establishment.</p>
               <p>He was an altogether singular personage—a sort of cut-off giant, scarcely five
                  feet in height, with an enormous chest, broad and powerful shoulders, and long
                  arms, ending in immense hands. Here, however, the Herculean character of the
                  strange figure terminated. An impotent conclusion ensued. The legs were actual
                  pipe-stems, so slender were they; and their tenuity was exaggerated by the
                  enormous size of the feet, reposing in mighty buckled shoes. The costume of this
                  personage consisted of heavy silk stockings, knee-breeches of drab cloth, a long
                  waistcoat reaching nearly to the knees, and buttoned up to the throat; and a<pb
                     n="6-7" xml:id="VAC6141-00000005"/> species of overcoat with a cape attached,
                  capacious flapped pockets, and skirts so long that they reached down to the
                  wearer's heels. Neck, this <foreign xml:lang="FRA">outré</foreign> figure had
                  none, apparently. The huge head, half covered by long, gray elf-locks, rose
                  abruptly from the shoulders, and the face was on a par with the <foreign
                     xml:lang="ITA">torso.</foreign> The eyes were dark, piercing, and seemed to
                  burn with cynical fire under the bushy, gray eyebrows. The nose was long and
                  prominent; the mouth wide, with thin, compressed lips, and a sardonic, almost
                  sneering expression. From time to time the personage uttered a sort of grunt,
                  agreeably alternating with a growl resembling that of a wolf disturbed while
                  tearing his food.</p>
               <p>He closed the book, and raised the glass cover, beneath which was stretched the
                  body of the rabbit—a white one of the English species.</p>
               <p>"Well," he said, in a vibrating and metallic voice, "he is dead, after all, I
                  think. The formula was wrong. To be certain, however."</p>
               <p>He took the white rabbit, and, opening the window, placed it upon the sill in the
                  fresh air. For ten minutes he remained looking attentively at it. No movement
                  indicated life.</p>
               <p>"Humph!" he said; "yes, this time he's dead. Decidedly the formula was wrong. And
                  yet—it is my dream, perchance, but no—this is not a chimera. And, if not—"</p>
               <p>He looked toward the skeleton, and, shaking his fist at it, exclaimed, in grim and
                  triumphant tones:</p>
               <p>"I cannot conquer you, King Death! My science is powerless in face of your
                  strength—you are master! But I do not yield; I can fight you, drive you back; and,
                  if not checkmate you, can sometimes tear your prey from your grasp! If I find what
                  I seek now, I triumph!—and I will find it!—Yes, the formula was wrong—there is a
                  better—yonder!"</p>
               <p>And, crossing the room with hasty strides, he took down a heavy volume from the
                  bookcase. As he did so, there fell from the shelf, where it had been concealed
                  behind the volume, a small white glove, with a bow of blue ribbon affixed to the
                  wrist—only the delicate fabric, once snow-white, was discolored by age, and the
                  ribbon-knot was faded.</p>
               <p>The eccentric personage picked up the glove and looked at it. An expression of
                  wonder had replaced the stern glance.</p>
               <p>"This here!" he muttered—"not crumbled and gone to dust like all else?"</p>
               <p>He remained perfectly motionless for a long time, looking at the glove, upon which
                  a ray of the autumn sunshine fell, through the window. An expression of sadness,
                  almost of tenderness, had come to the deep-set eyes now, and the thin lips.</p>
               <p>"I thought that was all done for—that business!" he muttered; "and yet here it
                  is!—a ghost out of the past.—What a fool I am!—The roses are as faded as the blue
                  of this ribbon; and the woman—she has forgotten!"</p>
               <p>The pathetic expression had already disappeared, and the sardonic smile came
                  back.</p>
               <p>"Here I am, dreaming over a woman's glove!" he muttered; "the old squat dwarf,
                  with his patients to look after! I'll cease this fooling!—go back to your
                  hiding-place, ghost!" he said, replacing the glove behind the books; "I'll never
                  summon you again or look at her, unless she calls me. 'Send to me if you are in
                  trouble,' I said to her, 'and I'll come, day or night.' I'll do that—but she shall
                  send for me first."</p>
               <p>Muttering to himself, he went back with his book to the table; at the moment, a
                  clock in the adjoining room struck the hour of noon.</p>
               <p>"Well, here's the morning wasted, and I must go to the governor," he said, closing
                  his book.—"Snuffers!"</p>
               <p>This cabalistic word died away, and was then repeated in a louder tone:</p>
               <p>"Snuffers!"</p>
               <p>"Very well, Dr. Vandyke!" a voice said from the next room; "there's no use bawling
                  at me—I'm coming."</p>
               <p>The door opened, and an old woman of short stature, rotund person, and ruddy face,
                  appeared, her white head-kerchief extending backward in the shape of a
                  sugar-loaf.</p>
               <p>"Most excellent Mrs. Snuffers," said Dr. Vandyke, with his satirical smile, "will
                  you be so obliging as to inform any person who calls to see me that I have gone to
                  the governor's?"</p>
               <p>"And when will you be back?"</p>
               <p>"I am unable to say, madam."</p>
               <p>Thereat the elderly lady looked peculiarly irate.</p>
               <p>"And how am I to know when you will want your dinner, Dr. Vandyke? How am I to
                  take care of you, and act as a Christian woman by you, when here, just as I am
                  getting ready to put the dinner on the table, you go flying off!"</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke glared at his enemy.</p>
               <p>"Dinner?" he said.</p>
               <p>"Dinner!" retorted the foe, in a loud voice—"dinner! and I'd like to know how
                  often I have said—"</p>
               <p>"That eating was the great object of existence? A thousand times, most respectable
                  Snuffers! True, life is after all but a struggle against starvation. All else but
                  what the human animal eats is vanity! And the fact here stated is susceptible of
                  demonstration. From the singular organization of the creature denominated
                  man—"</p>
               <p>Unfortunately for the doctor's learned discourse, an instant interruption thereof
                  occurred. Breathless, pop-eyed, with <emph>haste</emph> written all over his face,
                  rushed in a small black urchin, who nearly precipitated himself into the doctor's
                  arms. That gentleman received him with immovable elbow, sharp and bony, which sent
                  him flying back.</p>
               <p>"What's the meaning of this, you rascal?" quoth Dr. Vandyke.</p>
               <p>The boy cowered and fell back. But in a moment he regained breath and courage to
                  deliver his message. A gentleman, while riding along Gloucester Street, had been
                  thrown from his horse, badly injured, and borne into the Raleigh Tavern, where he
                  awaited Dr. Vandyke's professional services.</p>
               <p>"Say I am coming," grunted Dr. Vandyke.</p>
               <p>"And your dinner!" shrilled Mrs. Snuffers.</p>
               <p>The doctor wheeled and scowled at her.</p>
               <p>"Snuffers!—you are a pair of extinguishers instead of the implement bearing your
                  name. That is to say, you are—a woman!"</p>
               <p>Having discharged this thunder-bolt at the head of his enemy, Dr. Vandyke put on
                  his hat, grasped a large stick in his vigorous right hand, and, with his long
                  overcoat flapping against his shrunken legs, went out of the house, and toward the
                  Raleigh Tavern.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>II. A FALL FROM HORSEBACK.</head>
               <p>AT the moment when Dr. Vandyke had unburdened his mind by shaking his fist at the
                  skeleton, a man had passed along Gloucester Street, at full gallop, on a black
                  horse of great strength and speed.</p>
               <p>The man was apparently about thirty-five, erect, sinewy, though rather thin, and
                  clad in a dark riding-suit and elegant riding-boots. His face was handsome and
                  distinguished, but remarkable for its pallor, which his black hair rendered more
                  striking. His seat in the saddle was that of an excellent horseman, but he had
                  allowed the bridle to fall on the neck of his horse; and the<pb n="8-9"
                     xml:id="VAC6141-00000006"/> dreamy expression of his eyes indicated that he was
                  sunk in a profound reverie.</p>
               <p>The result of this was unfortunate. In passing the door of the <title>Virginia
                     Gazette</title> office, a young man, whose back was turned to him, suddenly
                  unfolded a number of the paper, just handed to him by a boy; and the black horse
                  shied violently, unseating and throwing his rider, whose head struck heavily
                  against the stones of the street.</p>
               <p>The young man, who had inadvertently caused the accident, hastened to the
                  assistance of the fallen horseman and raised him in his arms. He was quite
                  insensible, and the blood flowed from a deep gash in his temple.</p>
               <p>A crowd immediately collected.—While some endeavored unsuccessfully to stop the
                  black horse, which galloped off the rest gathered around the fallen man, shutting
                  of the fresh air. All at once, however, the throng divided, and was thrust back. A
                  tall, bony serving-man, with a face like bronze, hastened to throw his arms around
                  the victim of the accident. The new-comer paid no attention to the youth. Raising
                  the unconscious form in his arms, he bore it into the Raleigh Tavern, which was
                  only a few paces distant, and, ascending the narrow staircase, deposited it upon a
                  couch in one of the chambers.</p>
               <p>The crowd had remained on the porch of the tavern, but the young man who had
                  hastened to the rescue, followed. He had already dispatched a boy for Dr. Vandyke,
                  with orders that he should lose no time.</p>
               <p>The tall serving-man, meanwhile, busied himself in bathing the wounded forehead in
                  cold water. The youth looked on during this ceremony with an expression of much
                  concern.</p>
               <p>"What is the name of your master?" he said, at length, to the old servant.</p>
               <p>That personage replied in a brief, cold voice, without raising his head—</p>
               <p>"My Lord Ruthven."</p>
               <p>"Of his Excellency's suite?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>As the abrupt monosyllable was uttered, Lord Ruthven opened his eyes. As they fell
                  upon the young man, he started violently.</p>
               <p>"<emph>You</emph> here!" he gasped, with an appalled look. "Good
                     Heavens!—<emph>you?</emph>"</p>
               <p>He sank back, closing his eyes, and shuddering.</p>
               <p>The old serving-man rose erect, and his whole body seemed to stiffen—his eyes
                  expressed a vague astonishment, mingled with sternness. He had opened his lips to
                  speak, when another personage made his appearance—Dr. Vandyke.</p>
               <p>"Well," said Dr. Vandyke, approaching the couch, and striking the floor with his
                  stick at each step, "where is the hurt?"</p>
               <p>He stopped suddenly.</p>
               <p>"Humph!—Lord Ruthven!" he said. "An excellent horseman. How was he thrown?"</p>
               <p>"I was the unfortunate cause of the accident, doctor," said the young man.</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke wheeled round and gazed at the speaker.</p>
               <p>"You are Edmund Innis?" he said.</p>
               <p>"Then you know me?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I know you."</p>
               <p>"So much the better, doctor—then you will understand how much I regret this
                  unfortunate occurrence."</p>
               <p>In a few words he described the origin of the accident.</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke, who was now engaged in laving and bandaging the wound, replied only
                  in grunts. In a few moments, the patient uttered a deep sigh, and again opened his
                  eyes. Again he gave a violent start, and exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"<emph>You!</emph>—then I did not dream!—oh, no, no!"</p>
               <p>The words were almost a cry. The wounded man shook as he uttered them. Both the
                  youth and Dr. Vandyke listened with the utmost astonishment. Then the physician
                  looked keenly at the youth.</p>
               <p>"Your presence appears to agitate Lord Ruthven," he said.</p>
               <p>"Agitate him? my presence? I cannot conceive the reason!" exclaimed the youth in
                  utter bewilderment.</p>
               <p>"He evidently recognizes you!" growled Dr. Vandyke.</p>
               <p>"Recognizes me? I have never before seen him even!"</p>
               <p>"That is strange," was the reply, and Dr. Vandyke directed another keen glance at
                  the speaker.</p>
               <p>"It is true."</p>
               <p>"Doubtless—but listen, he is going to speak!"</p>
               <p>"That face!" murmured Lord Ruthven, without opening his eyes, "that
                  form!—again!—and here, when I thought I had fled from him forever?"</p>
               <p>"Listen!" said Dr. Vandyke, with a species of grunt.</p>
               <p>"The ocean is no barrier, then!" muttered Lord Ruthven. "Fate plays with me!"</p>
               <p>The young man gazed with great astonishment on the wounded nobleman, and then at
                  the physician.</p>
               <p>"This is the strangest of mysteries to me, doctor," he said. "What Lord Ruthven
                  can mean by thus speaking of me—as though we had met elsewhere—had relations with
                  each other—I know not. I am in utter darkness as to the meaning of the whole
                  affair. But one thing is plain—that my presence agitates him, as you say. I will
                  therefore go, and return later, to ascertain his condition. I had proposed leaving
                  Williamsburg this very day; but I shall now defer my departure. Before going I
                  must know that he is out of danger, as I was the unhappy occasion of his very
                  painful accident."</p>
               <p>"Right," said Dr. Vandyke; "go, and come back to-morrow. The hurt is serious—not
                  mortal at all."</p>
               <p>The youth bowed, looked with sympathy upon the pale face of the sick man, and left
                  the room.</p>
               <p>As the door closed, Lord Ruthven opened his eyes, and looked around him, evidently
                  seeking for some one. A deep sigh followed.</p>
               <p>"Where is he?" he said, in a low, trembling voice.</p>
               <p>"The young gentleman?" said Dr. Vandyke.</p>
               <p>"Yes—yes!"</p>
               <p>"He is gone."</p>
               <p>"His name?"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Edmund Innis."</p>
               <p>"I never heard the name before!"</p>
               <p>And, as he spoke, Lord Ruthven fell back, uttering a sigh, and closing his
                  eyes.</p>
               <p>"Humph!" grunted Dr. Vandyke; "the mystery is growing more mysterious than ever.
                  Well!"</p>
               <p>The words attracted the attention apparently of the sick man, who looked at the
                  speaker.</p>
               <p>"You are—a physician, I think, sir?" he said.</p>
               <p>"Yes—sent for, to come to see you."</p>
               <p>"Your name, doctor?"</p>
               <p>"Vandyke."</p>
               <p>The patient inclined his head faintly.</p>
               <p>"You are known to me, doctor, by repute at least. I am fortunate. Tell me how I
                  was hurt. My horse threw me, I think?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>A few words described the accident.</p>
               <p>"That was careless in me—very careless," he said; "and this young gentleman—will
                  he return?"</p>
               <p>"To-morrow, he informs me."</p>
               <p>Lord Ruthven made no reply for some moments. His face had grown whiter than
                  ever.</p>
               <p>"If I could only—leave this place tonight!" he murmured.</p>
               <p>He looked at the physician, and said:</p>
               <p>"My hurt is a mere trifle, I presume, doctor?"</p>
               <p>"Every thing in life is a trifle, and every thing important," was the reply. "You
                  may be ill for a month, or well in a week"</p>
               <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6141-00000007"/>
               <p>"Thanks, doctor, and now I think a little sleep will prove beneficial to me. May I
                  beg that you will call and see me again to-morrow?—Wait upon the doctor,
                  Fergus—and give orders that I shall not be disturbed. Then return."</p>
               <p>It was plain that Lord Ruthven wished to be alone, and Dr. Vandyke took his
                  departure, escorted ceremoniously by the body-servant Fergus.</p>
               <p>In five minutes Fergus reëntered the chamber, closing and locking the door behind
                  him. His master's face was even paler, if that were possible, than before. His
                  eyes burned in their deep sockets.</p>
               <p>"Fergus," he said in a low, awestruck whisper, "I have seen him!"</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>III. THE BODY-SERVANT.</head>
               <p>FERGUS greeted this abrupt exclamation with an air of perfect coolness.</p>
               <p>"The young man, my lord?" he said.</p>
               <p>"Yes!"</p>
               <p>"When?" was the laconic question of the old body-servant.</p>
               <p>"When I saw the other!"</p>
               <p>"The young woman, my lord?"</p>
               <p>"Yes!"</p>
               <p>This brief dialogue was followed by a long silence, interrupted once or twice by a
                  stifled groan from Lord Ruthven. Fergus knit his brows, but preserved his
                  coolness.</p>
               <p>"Well, my lord," he said, at length, "I say again what I have said time after time
                  in Scotland, England, France, and elsewhere, that the future must take care of
                  itself."</p>
               <p>Lord Ruthven frowned.</p>
               <p>"Meanwhile," continued the body-servant, coolly, "I would advise your lordship to
                  keep a stout heart, and hope for the best."</p>
               <p>Whereat his master broke out:</p>
               <p>"A stout heart!—then I am a baby!"</p>
               <p>Fergus saw the storm coming, but did not shrink in the least.</p>
               <p>"You mean that I am a mere nervous invalid!" continued Ruthven, angrily—"a
                  cowering slave, shrinking from shadows!"</p>
               <p>Fergus retained his calmness, and replied:</p>
               <p>"I beg to call your lordship's attention to the fact that, if you grow excited,
                  your wound will bleed afresh."</p>
               <p>"I care naught for it—let it bleed!"</p>
               <p>"The blood is even now oozing through the bandage, my lord."</p>
               <p>"Lord Ruthven replied by violently tearing the linen from his head. Immediately a
                  stream of blood ran down his white cheeks, rendering his appearance ghastly.</p>
               <p>The spectacle disarmed in an instant the stiff old Scotchman of his coolness. The
                  upright bar of iron suddenly melted. Fergus ran to his master, and placed his arm
                  around him.</p>
               <p>"My lord! my lord! you will kill yourself!—you will bleed to death!" he cried.</p>
               <p>"What care I, Fergus?"</p>
               <p>"My lord! my lord!"</p>
               <p>"What care I whether my wretched life ends here, and now or not?"</p>
               <p>The old man uttered a groan, and busied himself in washing away the blood. He then
                  replaced the bandage with the tenderness of a mother, and Lord Ruthven, who had
                  sunk back and closed his eyes, made no resistance.</p>
               <p>"Your lordship cuts your poor old Fergus to the very heart," said the servant.</p>
               <p>"I would not do so, Fergus," was the nobleman's low reply, "but you know well the
                  terrible effect upon me of the least expression of doubt upon <emph>that</emph>
                  subject. I am to '<emph>hope for the best!</emph>' Then I am not competent to
                     <emph>direct</emph> the event. You mean that, though you do not say it—!"</p>
               <p>"Your lordship grows excited."</p>
               <p>"You intimate that I <emph>may</emph> fail in the hour of trial!"</p>
               <p>"My lord!"</p>
               <p>"That I <emph>may</emph> be induced to yield to this accursed temptation!"</p>
               <p>"My lord, I think nothing, and say nothing."</p>
               <p>"Do you dream that I could?" said Lord Ruthven, in a despairing tone, and with
                  gloomy sarcasm he added:</p>
               <p>"You, no doubt, imagine that the part of the drama in which you appear is to be
                  enacted also in Virginia."</p>
               <p>Fergus replied with great coolness:</p>
               <p>"I think, my lord, that this world we live in is a very strange world, and that we
                  can't tell what will happen a day in advance."</p>
               <p>"True, true!" murmured Lord Ruthven, in a hopeless voice.</p>
               <p>"And as to myself, my lord—do you think I am afraid? Has your lordship the right
                  to think <emph>that,</emph> when I have remained with you—looking death in the
                  face?"</p>
               <p>The nobleman suddenly raised his head, and held out his hand to the old man.</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, Fergus!" he said, "pardon my injustice and ingratitude! You are truly
                  brave and faithful!"</p>
               <p>Fergus bent down and kissed the hand extended toward him, with an expression of
                  the deepest respect and affection. His face flushed, and a moisture came to the
                  old eyes.</p>
               <p>"There is naught to pardon, my lord. Am I not your servitor? Do with me as you
                  will."</p>
               <p>From under the bushy eyebrows darted a glance of absolute tenderness—that of the
                  feudal vassal for his beloved lord.</p>
               <p>"No!" Lord Ruthven said; "we are not master and servitor, Fergus. You are my
                  foster-brother—more than that, you are my friend. We must not quarrel. We are in a
                  strange land together. We must be fast and true—fast and true!"</p>
               <p>Fergus had retired a step, and now bowed respectfully.</p>
               <p>"I never doubted your devotion, Fergus; that you remain with me is sufficient
                  proof of that; nor did I ever dream that my brave Fergus was afraid."</p>
               <p>The old Scotchman, who had grown as cold as ever, shook his head.</p>
               <p>"As to the devotion, my lord, you do me no more than justice. I am devoted to you;
                  but, as to the fear, there you are wrong, I am afraid."</p>
               <p>"You have cause to be," groaned Lord Ruthven.</p>
               <p>"But I dare the danger, and don't let it frighten me, my lord. I have my duty to
                  do to the last of the great line of Ruthven; and that duty I will perform, though
                  the devil himself rise in my path!"</p>
               <p>"My faithful Fergus!"</p>
               <p>"Thanks, my lord, for the word. I hope I'm faithful. And, now as your lordship
                  calls me foster-brother—tell me—I wish to know—will your lordship remain here in
                  Virginia?"</p>
               <p>"I know not—no! no! How can I?"</p>
               <p>Fergus looked for some moments, intently, at his master. In this fixed glance
                  there was no little astonishment. Then, slowly shaking his head, he said:</p>
               <p>"It needs must be that something terrible is going to happen when the last of the
                  Ruthvens—the bravest, strongest of his race—talks thus! You shiver and turn white!
                  My lord, let us go."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes!—and yet—his excellency will think it strange! But—well, well! leave me
                  now. I will sleep, Fergus, and—to-morrow—"</p>
               <p>The voice died away, and the speaker, with his eyes fixed upon the floor, fell
                  into a profound and gloomy reverie.</p>
               <p>Fergus turned away. As he did so, he uttered some words in Gaelic. These words
                  signified—"It is fated!"</p>

               <head>IV. KNOWN AND UNKNOWN.</head>
               <p>ON the next evening Lord Ruthven, clad in a rich <foreign xml:lang="FRA">robe de
                     chambre,</foreign> was<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6141-00000008"/> stretched upon
                  the couch in his apartment at the Raleigh Tavern, when Fergus entered, and said in
                  his habitual tone of formal respect:</p>
               <p>"Mr. Edmund Innis has called to inquire after your lordship's health."</p>
               <p>"The young man?" said Lord Ruthven, his pale face suddenly filling with blood.</p>
               <p>"Yes, my lord."</p>
               <p>"I will see him."</p>
               <p>Fergus did not move.</p>
               <p>"You heard, Fergus—I will see this young gentleman," added his master.</p>
               <p>"Your lordship is very pale."</p>
               <p>"But I am better."</p>
               <p>"And still very weak."</p>
               <p>"The interview will do me no harm."</p>
               <p>"Your lordship insists?"</p>
               <p>"Admit him."</p>
               <p>Fergus bowed and went out—his steps were heard descending the stairs.</p>
               <p>As he disappeared, Lord Ruthven rose and went to a mirror.</p>
               <p>"I am indeed frightfully pale," he murmured, surveying his ghastly checks, "and my
                  appearance will probably shock my visitor. Still I must see him. It may be that
                  yesterday, while weak from loss of blood, stunned, with my brain reeling, I
                  fancied—simply <emph>fancied</emph>—but no! there can be no doubt! the face, the
                  hair, the lips, the eyes—all are the same!"</p>
               <p>The brows of the speaker contracted, and he drew a long, painful breath.</p>
               <p>"No! let me not attempt to cheat myself with any doubt!" he muttered; "'tis the
                  very man!—and I tempt the evil fate that is dogging me by even speaking to him—by
                  the very fact of receiving him! No, I will not see him! I will—Fergus!" And he
                  hastened toward the door.</p>
               <p>As he did so, steps were heard ascending the staircase without. The visitor was
                  plainly coming up, conducted by Fergus.</p>
               <p>"Too late!" groaned Lord Ruthven, "the die is cast. I must receive him. I shudder,
                  and yet advance toward him—would avoid him, and yet cannot resist the temptation
                  to gaze at him—to listen to him—"</p>
               <p>The hand of Fergus was heard upon the knob, and his voice uttered the words:</p>
               <p>"This, as you know, sir, is his lordship's apartment."</p>
               <p>And the door opened, Fergus standing ceremoniously aside, and ushering in the
                  visitor.</p>
               <p>Lord Ruthven had resumed his place upon the couch, from which he now rose as his
                  visitor entered. The two gentlemen exchanged courtly bows, and Lord Ruthven gazed
                  intently at the other, taking in every detail of his face and figure.</p>
               <p>Edmund Innis was a young man of twenty-two or three, with brown hair, powdered,
                  after the fashion of the period, and tied with a ribbon, eyes full of frankness, a
                  handsome mouth, indicating sincerity, and a carriage of the person at once proud
                  and courteous. His embroidered coat, long silken waistcoat, and ruffles, indicated
                  the class to which he belonged—for, at that time costume marked the social
                  position of its wearer; but these fine garments were quite shabby, and the general
                  appearance of the youth seemed to prove that his exchequer was in a very
                  dilapidated state indeed. His frill was irreproachably white, and upon his finger
                  sparkled a diamond ring; but the seams of his coat were threadbare, there was a
                  hole in one of his elbows, and the cocked-hat held in his hand had lost every
                  particle of the lace which once adorned it.</p>
               <p>In spite, however, of these unmistakable marks of the "poor gentleman," Lord
                  Ruthven had no difficulty in perceiving at a glance that his visitor was, what was
                  called at that time, a person of distinction. The head above the worn coat was
                  carried with proud courtesy, and the discolored hat descended in a bow which was
                  as graceful as that made by the nobleman.</p>
               <p>"I beg that you will be seated, sir," said Lord Ruthven, pointing to an
                  armchair.</p>
               <p>"Thanks, my lord," was the youth's reply, as he took his seat, "I am truly glad to
                  find your lordship so greatly improved since I last saw you."</p>
               <p>"A mere trifle, Mr. Innis."</p>
               <p>"I feared your case was much worse."</p>
               <p>"I am nearly recovered already."</p>
               <p>Innis bowed.</p>
               <p>"That relieves my mind of a load of self-reproach. I need scarce inform you that I
                  deeply regret my unfortunate agency in this accident, and feel that your lordship
                  has done me the simple justice to believe that I was entirely unaware of the
                  danger to which I enforced you. Your sudden fall was a very great shock to
                  me."</p>
               <p>"I did not doubt that for a moment, sir."</p>
               <p>"So you are not seriously injured?"</p>
               <p>"In twenty-four hours I shall be as well as ever."</p>
               <p>"God be thanked!" said the young man, cordially; "and now, having relieved my mind
                  of all anxiety as to your lordship's condition, I shall return to my home without
                  anxiety."</p>
               <p>During this exchange of commonplaces and expressions of politeness, Lord Ruthven
                  had continued to gaze intently at Innis, and, as trait after trait in the voice
                  and countenance of the youth came out more plainly, this fixed gaze became one of
                  much agitation. It was plain that Lord Ruthven was strongly moved. His dark eyes
                  were riveted to the visitor's face, a slight color tinged his pale cheeks, his
                  voice trembled perceptibly, and his breast labored in breathing.</p>
               <p>It was impossible that this agitation, if it were prolonged, should not attract
                  the attention of the visitor. Lord Ruthven seemed to feel this. He made a powerful
                  effort to suppress his emotion, in which he partially succeeded, and now said, in
                  a voice which had grown calm and ceremonious again:</p>
               <p>"You speak of returning to your home, sir—then you do not reside in
                  Williamsburg?"</p>
               <p>"No, my lord."</p>
               <p>"Your residence is—?"</p>
               <p>"In the mountains."</p>
               <p>"The Blue Ridge?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my lord. From the door of my little home you may look upon a ring wellnigh
                  of blue mountains, like waves on the horizon."</p>
               <p>"That must be indeed a most picturesque prospect, sir. The Blue Ridge, I have
                  indeed heard, is very beautiful."</p>
               <p>"Admirably beautiful and imposing."</p>
               <p>"As the Alps and Apennines, do you think, sir?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, doubtless not; but I have never seen either, and can form no opinion."</p>
               <p>"Then, you have never visited Europe, Mr. Innis?"</p>
               <p>"Never, my lord. I am a mere Buckskin, as the phrase is in our country, and scarce
                  travelled beyond my poor parish in the mountains."</p>
               <p>Lord Ruthven drew a long breath, and continued to gaze intently at the youth.</p>
               <p>"I thought—I had—seen you before," he said, in a low tone, and with an agitation
                  which he could not master.</p>
               <p>"I fancied so," Innis replied, looking with some astonishment at the speaker.</p>
               <p>"You fancied so?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my lord."</p>
               <p>"Pray, why?"</p>
               <p>"From some singular exclamations which you uttered yesterday."</p>
               <p>"Some exclamations!"</p>
               <p>"When you had not fully recovered from the stunning effect of your fall."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes!" returned Lord Ruthven, with a sickly smile, "so that I uttered, you
                  say—some—singular exclamations?"</p>
               <p>"Singular only as appearing to indicate upon your part an impression that<pb
                     n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6141-00000009"/> you had met with me in Europe, and were
                  surprised to find me in Virginia."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I said that? How very absurd these fancies of fever!"</p>
               <p>"I am assured that fever invariably produces these effects."</p>
               <p>"And you attached no importance, I presume, to these wanderings, sir?"</p>
               <p>"None whatever."</p>
               <p>"They are truly absurd, and at times, I fancy, rather laughable. Did I say more in
                  my delirium?—I am naturally curious to hear of my vagaries."</p>
               <p>The sickly smile was repeated, as Lord Ruthven uttered these words with assumed
                  carelessness; but his intent and burning eyes, fixed on the face of his visitor,
                  betrayed the deep importance which he attached to the reply.</p>
               <p>Again Innis could not avoid observing that singular agitation. He hesitated,
                  feeling a vague astonishment and uneasiness. Whither was the singular colloquy
                  drifting? What was the object of Lord Ruthven in these questions, and why was he
                  so deeply agitated?</p>
               <p>"You are silent, sir!" said Lord Ruthven, with feverish emotion; "I wish to
                  know—"</p>
               <p>His voice had grown brief and imperious; but he suddenly stopped.</p>
               <p>"Pardon my rudeness, Mr. Innis," he said, sorrowfully; "my nerves indeed must have
                  been shaken, that I address a gentleman of your quality with so little ceremony. I
                  beg you will overlook my rudeness."</p>
               <p>Innis smiled.</p>
               <p>"I am far from thinking any apology necessary, my lord; nor was there aught in
                  your tone even at which I could justly take offence."</p>
               <p>"Thanks for your courtesy, sir; and now may I beg to repeat my question in milder
                  terms?"</p>
               <p>"Your question?"</p>
               <p>"Whether I said aught more in my delirium yesterday than that I thought I had met
                  with you in Europe, and did not expect to see you here?"</p>
               <p>"Frankly, you did say more."</p>
               <p>"What more, may I ask?" said Lord Ruthven, turning a shade paler.</p>
               <p>Innis still hesitated. He remembered distinctly the words uttered by the noble-man
                  on the preceding day:</p>
               <p>"<emph>That face, that form again!—and here!—when I thought I had fled from him
                     forever!</emph>"</p>
               <p>He looked at Lord Ruthven and was silent a moment; then he said:</p>
               <p>"Your lordship attaches undue importance to these exclamations of fever—yours did
                  not differ, probably, from those uttered by others at such moments. I am happy to
                  find that this confusion of mind has now wholly disappeared—and that—"</p>
               <p>"Pardon the interruption, Mr. Innis!" said Lord Ruthven, feverishly, "but you have
                  not replied to the question I had the honor to address to you."</p>
               <p>"You would have me—?"</p>
               <p>"Essay to recall, if it please you, sir, the exact words which I uttered. I beg
                  that you will reply frankly."</p>
               <p>"I will do so, my lord. I do recall your expressions."</p>
               <p>"What were they, sir?"</p>
               <p>"Your lordship compels me to remember and repeat words which I had almost
                  forgotten. As you plainly wish to have them repeated, I reply that upon opening
                  your eyes, and seeing me standing before you, you addressed me as a person from
                  whom you <emph>thought you had fled forever!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Fled forever!</emph> I said that?"</p>
               <p>"Such were your words, and I pray you to observe that they are only repeated at
                  your urgent request. They will, of course, be buried in my bosom, as having no
                  importance or significance."</p>
               <p>"I beseech you to thus bury them!" exclaimed Lord Ruthven, with irrepressible
                  agitation, "and that from this moment ment, if possible, you will even cease to
                  remember them."</p>
               <p>"You can rely upon my word with implicit faith," said the youth, proudly.</p>
               <p>"I feel that I can do so, Mr. Innis. Human beings with eyes and lips like your own
                  never deceive, sir!"</p>
               <p>Innis inclined his head.</p>
               <p>"Thanks for your courtesy, my lord."</p>
               <p>"Do not even remember if that is possible, those foolish words, Mr. Innis! My life
                  has been strange and unfortunate, my words and actions are wild, inexplicable, and
                  yet could be explained! I said yesterday—but why recall that?—there is a woful
                  mystery, to be frank with you, sir, under what I uttered. I speak to a man of
                  honor—your face says 'Trust me!' and would to God that I could speak! I cannot. I
                  have even now said far more than in cooler moments I should have done. We shall
                  see each other, after this day, no more, I hope—<emph>suppose</emph> I should say,
                  sir!"</p>
               <p>Lord Ruthven wiped his forehead, upon which had burst forth an icy perspiration.
                  By an immense effort, he suppressed his emotion.</p>
               <p>"This seems strange to you, doubtless, sir, and you will think that my fever has
                  not left me," he added, more calmly. "I shall, therefore, cease to allude further
                  to this somewhat strange subject, only repeating my request that you will forget
                  all these absurdities—the ravings of my delirium, and the words just uttered in
                  confidence by one gentleman to another."</p>
               <p>"I shall carefully observe your request, my lord. Your fever and your confidence
                  are both sacred to me."</p>
               <p>"Thanks, sir," said Lord Ruthven. "I could not feel more perfectly assured of that
                  than I now do, in consequence of your promise."</p>
               <p>His head drooped, and an expression of weariness and sorrow came to his face.
                  Then, raising his eyes slowly, he said:</p>
               <p>"Do you know what thought passed through my mind at that instant, Mr. Innis? I
                  thought how glad I should be could I solicit your friendship."</p>
               <p>"My lord—"</p>
               <p>"But I cannot—I should be proud and glad to do so—but—but—I shall in two or three
                  weeks return to Europe, and it is wholly improbable that we shall ever meet again
                  in this world."</p>
               <p>Innis listened with astonishment, and could find no explanation for the tones and
                  glances of Lord Ruthven. His voice had grown mild, cordial, and full of kindness.
                  The glance fixed upon the young man's face was almost one of affection.</p>
               <p>"You do me great honor," said the youth, much moved, "and can you not remain? Do
                  so, if possible. I, too, should be proud to secure your lordship's regard and
                  friendship."</p>
               <p>"You!"</p>
               <p>"Assuredly."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no! "Tis impossible!" And yet—no! Pardon me—I mean only that I must
                  return."</p>
               <p>"You should remain with us longer. Virginia is the land of lands!"</p>
               <p>"'Tis doubtless beautiful, sir, but my voyage is unavoidable."</p>
               <p>"You cannot defer it?"</p>
               <p>"I regret that it is out of my power to do so, sir."</p>
               <p>Innis rose.</p>
               <p>"Well, at least, my lord," he said, "your hurt is healing, and I shall not have
                  the great grief of reflecting that your death lay at my door."</p>
               <p>He smiled, but Lord Ruthven's face had no smile upon it as he replied:</p>
               <p>"Certainly no blame could—or can—attach to you, sir."</p>
               <p>"And Virginia is spared the sadness, too, since you will not die on our soil."</p>
               <p>"I know not, sir," said Lord Ruthven, with a singular and gloomy look.</p>
               <p>Innis laughed.</p>
               <p>"Let us hope for the best," he said.<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6141-00000010"/> "I
                  shall now bid your lordship good-even."</p>
               <p>"Can you not sit longer, sir?"</p>
               <p>"No, with thanks. I must set out for the mountains at dawn, and I shall now have
                  the honor of taking a final leave of your lordship."</p>
               <p>As he spoke, Innis cordially extended his hand, his handsome face lit up by a
                  friendly smile.</p>
               <p>Lord Ruthven made no movement to accept the proffered hand.</p>
               <p>His eyes had suddenly closed, as if he were about to faint, and his face had grown
                  ghastly pale.</p>
               <p>"Your lordship is ill!" exclaimed Innis, hastening toward him.</p>
               <p>"No, no!" returned Lord Ruthven, in a low voice, and repulsing the youth with a
                  motion of his hand. "That is to say—a slight dizziness—a species of vertigo,
                  doubtless—but 'tis passed."</p>
               <p>He rose, and, without making any motion to offer his hand to his visitor, made a
                  low and courtly bow.</p>
               <p>"Farewell, sir," he said; "I owe you many thanks for this obliging visit. Should
                  we not meet again, I shall retain in my memory the recollection of a most
                  agreeable interview, Mr. Innis."</p>
               <p>A second bow followed the words. Innis, without offering his hand a second time,
                  replied by a similar inclination, and, putting on his hat, went out of the
                  apartment.</p>
               <p>As the door closed, Lord Ruthven tottered rather than walked to the couch, and
                  fell upon it, as though his strength were completely exhausted.</p>
               <p>"No, no, no!" he groaned, "<emph>I could not</emph> take his hand! I could not be
                  guilty of that infamy at least! Whatever devil drives me—whatever I do—I will not
                  be false—no! never! If he falls by my sword 'twill not be the friend whose hand
                  I've clasped—Knowing—"</p>
               <p>There the voice of the speaker died away in a species of gasp.</p>
               <p>"Cursed! cursed! cursed!"</p>
               <p>These words escaped in a stifled whisper from Lord Ruthven's lips, and he fell
                  back, closing his eyes.</p>
               <p>When, ten minutes afterward, Fergus entered the apartment, he found that his
                  master had fainted.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>V. IN THE DARKNESS.</head>
               <p>SINCE the scenes just described, three days had passed. Night had come, and a
                  violent storm was lashing the capital. The wind rolled with the hoarse moan of the
                  sea in a tempest, above the crouching houses; from moment to moment the black
                  clouds cracked from horizon to zenith, letting out the lightning; and these
                  dazzling flashes were followed by bursts of thunder, which seemed to utter aloud
                  the fury of inanimate Nature.</p>
               <p>In spite of the storm and the heavy drops preluding the coming rain, Lord Ruthven,
                  who had risen from his sick-couch on that evening, took his way toward the
                  governor's palace to call upon his excellency.</p>
               <p>He wore a suit of black velvet, and the small short-sword, then a portion of
                  full-dress costume. The lightning, from instant to instant, revealed his funereal
                  figure and pallid face. From the gloomy expression of eye and lip it was plain
                  that the agitating scenes of the day of his accident had profoundly impressed
                  him.</p>
               <p>"Well," he muttered, "I will sound his excellency to-night upon the subject of my
                  departure—that is the best course. <emph>He</emph> has left Williamsburg—for the
                  moment, the danger is past—but who knows? He may come back; fate is powerful; and
                  then—then—yes, I will go! That is best!"</p>
               <p>He went on, paying no attention to the storm.</p>
               <p>"Let me not palter with my destiny," he added, his voice low and mournful, his
                  lips assuming a melancholy smile. "This accident is a presage—reciprocity is the
                  law of Nature—his act on this very street struck <emph>me</emph> down—mine will
                  strike <emph>him!</emph>"</p>
               <p>A dazzling flash of lightning followed the words, and the roar of thunder
                  succeeded. A slight color had come to the pale face.</p>
               <p>"I believe I enjoy this hurly-burly of Nature," muttered Lord Ruthven; "'tis in
                  unison with my stormy life. Yes; the more I reflect, the more clearly I perceive
                  'tis best to go. And yet—am I panic-stricken, timid, nervous? <emph>He</emph> is
                  no longer here. He has gone to his home in the mountains—"</p>
               <p>The speaker struck suddenly against some object approaching him. It was a man
                  whose footsteps had been drowned by the uproar of the wind, and whose form had
                  been concealed by the black darkness of the night. Lord Ruthven drew his
                  dress-sword—for it appeared to him that something hostile was intended by this
                  unknown—and, retreating a step, directed the point of the sword toward the shadowy
                  figure.</p>
               <p>At the same instant a flash of lightning cut the air like a white-hot blade, and
                  Ruthven recognized Innis.</p>
               <p>"You!" he cried.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I, my lord!" returned the young man, with some sternness in his voice. "What
                  means this threat—this sword's point at my breast?"</p>
               <p>Lord Ruthven shuddered from head to foot, and dropped the point of his
                  dress-sword, which he violently thrust back into its scabbard.</p>
               <p>"You, sir!" he repeated. "Good Heavens! who could have dreamed of this encounter?
                  I thought you absent—my sword's point—'twas unwittingly that I drew my
                  weapon—pardon me, sir—the night is dark, and—you have not then left
                  Williamsburg?"</p>
               <p>The agitation of the speaker was so great that Innis understood instantly that
                  nothing hostile had been intended.</p>
               <p>"No, my lord," he said; "and we encounter each other again under singular
                  circumstances."</p>
               <p>"Fatal circumstances!"</p>
               <p>Innis uttered a light-hearted laugh in the darkness.</p>
               <p>"Not so very fatal, my lord, since no one is hurt. Your sword at my breast caused
                  me some astonishment, and a little irritation, it may be. But a word explains all.
                  You no doubt took me for a footpad, and in the dark 'tis well to be on one's
                  guard."</p>
               <p>"Yes—and in the light," was the reply of Ruthven, in a singular tone.</p>
               <p>"You were going—?"</p>
               <p>"To see his excellency. And you, sir?"</p>
               <p>"To the house of a gentleman living near the capitol."</p>
               <p>"You designed leaving Williamsburg, I think, when we parted, sir?"</p>
               <p>"I did so design, my lord, but the fates forbade."</p>
               <p>"The fates?"</p>
               <p>"Or chance, or Providence, as there is no chance, I think, in life."</p>
               <p>"You are right, sir. If you will not think me singular or intrusive, may I ask
                  what you call 'the fates,' or 'Providence?'"</p>
               <p>Lord Ruthven heard the smile, so to say, of Innis, as he replied in the
                  darkness:</p>
               <p>"Oh, my lord, the explanation is extremely simple. I came to Williamsburg,
                  designing to make arrangements with my father's friend, Mr. Wythe, to become a
                  law-student in his office—when about to leave the capital he begged me to stay and
                  copy for him some important papers."</p>
               <p>Lord Ruthven remained silent.</p>
               <p>"There is all the mystery," said Innis.</p>
               <p>"And—this work, sir—doubtless, 'tis onerous?"</p>
               <p>"Somewhat."</p>
               <p>"'Twill detain you longer?"</p>
               <pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6141-00000011"/>
               <p>"I fear so."</p>
               <p>"When you are anxious to return?"</p>
               <p>"I confess, I shall be pleased to do so."</p>
               <p>Lord Ruthven reflected for a few moments, and then said, in a melancholy tone:</p>
               <p>"I envy you, Mr. Innis, this return to your family. The hearthstone will brighten
                  for you; with me 'tis different. I have no family and no home—a residence
                  only."</p>
               <p>"I am no less unfortunate, my lord. My parents are dead, and I have no brothers or
                  sisters."</p>
               <p>"But relatives, friends—perchance, one nearer and dearer than any friend—"</p>
               <p>The expression of the speaker's voice was singular. The words were careless, but
                  he listened anxiously, it was plain, for Innis's reply.</p>
               <p>"Nearer—and—dearer?" said the youth, in a confused voice.</p>
               <p>"I mean that you are expected by some dear one yonder, Mr. Innis—some young
                  lady—who loves you—"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, my lord! I'm not so fortunate."</p>
               <p>"There is none such?"</p>
               <p>"None."</p>
               <p>Lord Ruthven drew a long breath.</p>
               <p>"Heaven be thanked!" he muttered.</p>
               <p>"Your lordship said—?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing, Mr. Innis."</p>
               <p>A sudden flash revealed Lord Ruthven's face. He was sunk in profound thought—his
                  eyes half closed. But this preoccupation rapidly disappeared.</p>
               <p>"I am detaining you, Mr. Innis," he said. "This interview, as you have said, is
                  singular. Commencing with my sword-point directed at your breast"—the speaker
                  shuddered as he uttered these words—"and ending with a somewhat ill-bred intrusion
                  upon your private affairs."</p>
               <p>"Oh, not at all, I beg you to believe," said Innis; "'twas perfectly natural."</p>
               <p>"There was certainly no intent to offend you with sword or tongue. Mr. Innis; and
                  now I bid you good-even. The storm is about to burst. We shall not meet again,
                  sir—I have resolved to return to Europe. Farewell, sir."</p>
               <p>He passed Innis, as he spoke, walking rapidly, and not offering his hand.</p>
               <p>"The die is cast—I go, and go at once!" he muttered; "to stay were madness
                  indeed!"</p>
               <p>The roar of the wind drowned the words. Unconsciously he turned his head. At the
                  same moment a vivid flash lit up the street, revealing the form of Innis.</p>
               <p>The youth was standing motionless, looking after him.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>VI. RUTHVEN'S RESOLUTION.</head>
               <p>TOWARD midnight Lord Ruthven returned from the governor's palace, through the
                  drenched streets, and, going to his apartment in the Raleigh, aroused Fergus, who
                  was stretched asleep upon a pallet in one corner of the chamber.</p>
               <p>"Fergus! Fergus!" he said, feverishly.</p>
               <p>"My lord," was the cool response; and Fergus, wide awake in a moment, rose to his
                  feet.</p>
               <p>"Pack my trunks, Fergus," said Lord Ruthven, in the same agitated voice; "we are
                  going."</p>
               <p>"Yes, my lord."</p>
               <p>And the old servant calmly began to collect the articles of his master's
                  ward-robe, carefully fold them, and deposit them in two or three large
                  travelling-trunks which stood in a sort of closet.</p>
               <p>"We are going," repeated Lord Ruthven, walking up and down the apartment.</p>
               <p>"To Europe, my lord?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>Fergus nodded.</p>
               <p>"I am glad to go," he said, "and at once."</p>
               <p>"I have seen him again!"</p>
               <p>"Him?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Him.</emph>"</p>
               <p>Fergus made the same movement with his head.</p>
               <p>"Then he has not left this town?"</p>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>"Your lordship met him?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—to-night."</p>
               <p>"In the storm, my lord?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; and wellnigh began the struggle—my sword at his breast."</p>
               <p>And Lord Ruthven described his nocturnal meeting with Innis.</p>
               <p>Fergus listened, busily packing the trunks meanwhile.</p>
               <p>"Well," he said, when Ruthven had finished his narrative, "I think your lordship
                  acts wisely. This is no place for you if he is here. I know not how it is, but I
                  grow more frightened day by day. Your lordship is changing, and for the worse; let
                  us go."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes! Mount your horse tomorrow, ride to the port on James River, and engage
                  our passage to England."</p>
               <p>"I will do so, my lord, at dawn."</p>
               <p>And Fergus continued steadily to pack the travelling-trunks.</p>
               <p>Lord Ruthven walked up and down the apartment for some time in gloomy thought,
                  then took his seat at a table, and wrote for an hour; then, laying down his pen,
                  rested his forehead upon his arms, crossed on the table, and either reflected or
                  slept.</p>
               <p>Fergus continued to pack the trunks.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>VII. FERGUS RIDES.</head>
               <p>WITH the first light of dawn Fergus was in the saddle, and riding in the direction
                  of James River, where, at the nearest wharf, he expected to find some bark bound
                  for England.</p>
               <p>He saw two vessels, and was soon making inquiries.</p>
               <p>"You are outward bound soon?" he said to the captain of one.</p>
               <p>"No," was the reply; "just arrived from Portsmouth."</p>
               <p>"And that other bark yonder?"</p>
               <p>"From the Bermudas—hugged me close all the way—came up the river together."</p>
               <p>"There is no outward-bound ship?"</p>
               <p>"None."</p>
               <p>Fergus rode back and reported the result to his master, who received the
                  information in gloomy silence.</p>
               <p>"Bring the last number of the <title>Gazette,</title>" he said, at length.</p>
               <p>Fergus descended, procured the Virginia <title>Gazette</title> from the landlord,
                  and returned.</p>
               <p>"This paper brought me ill-fortune but the other day," Lord Ruthven muttered, with
                  a painful smile; "perhaps 'twill bring good fortune to-day—let us see."</p>
               <p>He opened the paper, and his eyes fell upon the lines:</p>
               <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Port of York.—The Charming Sally, Captain Fellowes, intends for
                  England in six days from this date. Passage secured by applying to Captain
                  Fellowes."</p>
               <p>Lord Ruthven read this announcement to Fergus, and said:</p>
               <p>"This vessel sails to-morrow; I will go in her."</p>
               <p>Fergus nodded, went to the stable, mounted, and took his way toward York-town,
                  where he found Captain Fellowes standing on the wharf, and superintending the
                  efforts of his crew to drag the Charming Sally on shore by means of cables.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter?" said Fergus.</p>
               <p>Captain Fellowes turned round, surveyed Fergus attentively, and said:</p>
               <p>"The matter is, my friend, that the Charming Sally has scraped a hole in her<pb
                     n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6141-00000012"/> sheathing, and that the young lady is
                  going to be laid up, neither more nor less than happens on certain other occasions
                  with the interesting sex."</p>
               <p>And Captain Fellowes winked, rolled the quid of tobacco in his ruddy check under
                  his tongue, and uttered a jovial laugh.</p>
               <p>"Then the ship will not sail?" said Fergus, cool and unimpressed.</p>
               <p>"Can't, my friend," said the captain. "She'd spring a leak in the very middle of
                  the Atlantic, mayhap; then good-by to the Charming Sally."</p>
               <p>"Is any other vessel in port outward bound?"</p>
               <p>"There is no other."</p>
               <p>"And how long will it take to repair your vessel?"</p>
               <p>"Well, it may take three weeks, and it may take three months. To tell you the
                  truth, my friend, I begin to think we have made our last voyage this year."</p>
               <p>Fergus rode back to Williamsburg, and reported this second failure to Lord
                  Ruthven. A bitter smile this time greeted the return of the old servant.</p>
               <p>"Fate seems to have assumed the direction of affairs," said Lord Ruthven; "but I
                  shall make one more effort. Rest to-day, Fergus; to-morrow ride to St. Mary's on
                  the Potomac. If you fail to engage a passage there, proceed northward, if
                  necessary, to the port of New York. I have no choice; any species of vessel will
                  content me, seaworthy or unseaworthy. This may end as it will."</p>
               <p>And Lord Ruthven, leaning back in his chair, was silent. Fergus looked at him
                  fixedly, shook his head, but made no reply, and quietly left the apartment.</p>
               <p>On the next morning he ordered his horse to be saddled, put a change of clothes in
                  a small valise, and then, hat in hand, said to Lord Ruthven, who was gazing upon
                  the floor in a fit of gloomy abstraction:</p>
               <p>"I am about to set out; has your lordship any further orders?"</p>
               <p>"None."</p>
               <p>"I must engage passages for your lordship and myself, either at St. Mary's or at
                  New York?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>Fergus bowed, and went toward the door. As he did so, steps were heard ascending
                  the stairs, and a knock came at the door. The old body-servant opened it. A man,
                  wearing the livery of the governor, appeared, holding in his hand a letter.</p>
               <p>"For his lordship," he said.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>VIII. THE TWO LETTERS.</head>
               <p>RUTHVEN mechanically opened the letter, glancing at it with little interest. As he
                  read, however, his expression grew more gloomy. Having finished it, he placed it
                  upon the table, muttering—</p>
               <p>"Impossible!"</p>
               <p>Fergus glanced at his master, hesitated, then returned a step, and said:</p>
               <p>"Will your lordship send a reply by the servant?"</p>
               <p>Ruthven raised his head.</p>
               <p>"No—yes—let him wait a few moments."</p>
               <p>Fergus communicated this order to the governor's servant, who closed the door, and
                  descended the stairs.</p>
               <p>"Fergus!" said Ruthven, without raising his eyes.</p>
               <p>"My lord!"</p>
               <p>"That same fate we were talking of has taken a new form."</p>
               <p>"A new form my lord?"</p>
               <p>"The form of his excellency the governor."</p>
               <p>Fergus nodded; nothing ever seemed to astonish him.</p>
               <p>"Listen!" said his master, in a cold, careless voice.</p>
               <p>And, taking the letter from the table, he read:</p>

               <p>"You see," said Lord Ruthven, stopping suddenly, and throwing down the letter.</p>
               <p>"Yes, my lord. And what will be your reply? My own movements will depend
                  thereon."</p>
               <p>"I shall not change my decision."</p>
               <p>"Your lordship will go, all the same?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>Fergus went toward the door.</p>
               <p>"Wait an instant and take my reply," said Lord Ruthven. "These strange serving-men
                  sink their eyes before me, but look pryingly at my poor pale face, Fergus, when my
                  eyes are turned from them. I would be served by none but yourself."</p>
               <p>And, drawing his chair to the table, Lord Ruthven took up a pen, and began to
                  write.</p>
               <p>He had written but two or three lines, when steps again ascended the stairs
                  without, and a second knock was heard at the door.</p>
               <p>Fergus went and opened it. A servant belonging to the tavern stood before him, a
                  letter in his hand.</p>
               <p>"This was left for Lord Ruthven," said the man.</p>
               <p>"By whom?" said Fergus.</p>
               <p>"By young Mr. Innis."</p>
               <p>At that name Lord Ruthven quickly raised his head.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Innis!" he exclaimed.</p>
               <p>"Yess, my lord," said the man.</p>
               <p>"When was this note brought—give it me!"</p>
               <p>The man was about to approach, but Fergus intercepted him.</p>
               <p>"No one waits on his lordship but myself," he said.</p>
               <p>Placing the letter on the silver waiter, he handed it to Lord Ruthven, who took it
                  hurriedly, and tore it open with visible agitation. The letter contained these
                  lines:</p>

               <p>Lord Ruthven drew a long breath, and then turned to the servant who had brought
                  the letter.</p>
               <p>"Who left this?" he said.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Innis himself, my lord. He was riding by with young Mr. Cary."</p>
               <p>"On a journey?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my lord."</p>
               <p>Lord Ruthven looked at the letter—glanced then at the governor's—tore up what he
                  had written, and said to Fergus in a low tone:</p>

               <p>"As there is no further danger, you need not ride to-day."</p>
               <p>Fergus bowed.</p>
               <p>As he left the room, he muttered in Gaelic as before:</p>
               <p>"It is fated!"</p>
               <p>An hour afterward, his excellency the governor received a note from Lord Ruthven,
                  saying that, in order not to subject his excellency to inconvenience, he would
                  abandon for the present his intended voyage, which nevertheless might be rendered
                  necessary at any moment.</p>
               <p>Having dispatched this reply, Lord Ruthven shut himself up, locked his door, and,
                  drawing from a secret pocket in his breast a book, began to write in it.</p>
               <p>"Fatality—that is strong!" he said in a low tone, "but the <emph>will</emph> of a
                  man—is that nothing? I have <emph>willed</emph>—naught shall move me!"</p>

               <head>IX. IN WHICH THE HISTORY PASSES TO THE MOUNTAINS.</head>
               <p>THE current of the narrative bears us now from Williamsburg toward the
                  mountains.</p>
               <p>It was there that the singular drama we essay to unfold before the reader was to
                  find its stage, or at least to play its chief scenes; and, by accompanying him who
                  is the main personage, we shall witness what occurred.</p>
               <p>The note for Lord Ruthven had been delivered at the door of the Raleigh by Edmund
                  Innis, as he passed, on horseback, along Gloucester Street, directing his course
                  toward the Blue Ridge. Beside him rode a young gentleman, with pale-blue eyes,
                  chestnut curls, and laughing lips.</p>
               <p>Philip, or Phil Cary, as everybody called him, was about the age of Innis, that is
                  to say, twenty-two or three, graceful, vigorous, and active in every movement,
                  clad in a velvet hunting-suit, with innumerable pockets; and from his cocked hat
                  floated a handsome feather. It would be impossible to imagine any thing more
                  joyous, gallant, and redolent of youth, than his smile. Life brimmed for him, with
                  gayety, enjoyment, and the charming zest which accompanies the first years of
                  manhood—very plainly, the inexorable <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ennui</foreign> which
                  lies at the foundation of human life, as says Bossuet, had never touched him with
                  its chilling finger. Jest, laughter, merriment, overflowed in him; you would have
                  said that this young human being was glad that he was alive.</p>
               <p>Beside Innis, somewhat sad and thoughtful, Phil Cary resembled a sunbeam plunging
                  through foliage into some shadowy nook; he sang, laughed, rallied his companion,
                  looking on all sides with his roving glance, and turning all he saw into
                  comedy.</p>
               <p>"Come, old fellow!" he exclaimed, "what's the matter? Laugh, I say!"</p>
               <p>"At what, Phil?" said Innis, smiling.</p>
               <p>"At everything, or nothing. What's the use of sighing?"</p>
               <p>"I am not sighing."</p>
               <p>"Well, you are thinking—that's equally bad."</p>
               <p>"Don't you ever think?"</p>
               <p>"Never! I sing."</p>
               <p>And Phil Cary burst forth into a song which made the forest, through which they
                  were passing, echo again.</p>
               <p>"Very good!" he said when he had finished his song; "I know what you are thinking
                  of."</p>
               <p>"What?"</p>
               <p>"I mean what person."</p>
               <p>"Tell me."</p>
               <p>"Of Honoria."</p>
               <p>"Pshaw!" said Innis, coloring; "why should I waste my time in—in—what you mean?
                  And yet, Phil—I might retort and say that you were thinking of—her elder
                  sister?"</p>
               <p>"Wrong! I never indulge in that folly."</p>
               <p>"Then my fair cousin Lou and yourself have quarrelled."</p>
               <p>"Not in the least. All the quarrelling is done by the old lady—my venerable mamma
                  in the coach yonder."</p>
               <p>"Look; she is calling you."</p>
               <p>In fact, there was seen in front a large family chariot, drawn by four horses; and
                  from the window waved a white handkerchief. Mr. Phil Cary obeyed this summons,
                  and, putting spur to his horse, was soon beside the coach, which was occupied by
                  an elderly lady in black silk.</p>
               <p>"Philip, my dear," said the elderly lady, drawing down a large pair of glasses
                  until they rested upon her nose, and gazing over them.</p>
               <p>"Well, mamma."</p>
               <p>"Did you write in my name to Mrs. Byrd to say that we should stop at
                  Westover?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my respected mamma."</p>
               <p>"In time?"</p>
               <p>"Full time; you see there are some young ladies there on a visit; and as I am in
                  pursuit of a wife—"</p>
               <p>"Nonsense, Philip! why <emph>will</emph> you run on in that absurd manner?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Absurd,</emph> my dear madam? I think 'tis the most intelligent thing I
                  could do."</p>
               <p>The scapegrace turned his head as he spoke and winked at Innis, who had ridden
                  up.</p>
               <p>"Why think of marriage for a dozen years to come?"</p>
               <p>"Behold," cried Mr. Phil Cary, "the most unreasonable of her sex! May I request to
                  be informed of my age, my dear madam?"</p>
               <p>"You are twenty-three in November."</p>
               <p>"And the age of my papa when he married my mamma?"</p>
               <p>"There, there, Philip—let us not speak so lightly—I was wrong perhaps, but you are
                  my only stay now; you must remember that, my dear."</p>
               <p>The young man became for a moment serious, and said:</p>
               <p>"My dear mother, there is no danger of my leaving you. A wife!—what do I want with
                  a wife? Rest easy on that score."</p>
               <p>After which assurance, he rode on with Innis, in advance of the coach, which,
                  heavily laden with huge trunks went creaking on its way.</p>
               <p>I know nothing more delightful than a horseback journey through the variegated
                  forest, in the brilliant, breezy autumn, when youth and health give a zest to
                  existence, and the wind in the foliage whispers its mysterious secrets. Then the
                  fresh breeze laughs—in riper age it sighs. To be young is the secret!—to ride then
                  through the splendid, many-colored forest, the cream of earthly enjoyment.</p>
               <p>I should like to pause at "Westover," where the travellers were received with warm
                  hospitality. But these old interiors interest few persons to-day. "Westover," the
                  home once of Colonel William Byrd, the haunt of starry-eyed maidens, passes, as on
                  a moving canvas, and our party continue their way. They halted again at
                  "Belvidere," on the site of the present city of Richmond, where they were lulled
                  to sleep by the sweet murmur of the falls in the river—then they stopped at
                  "Dungeonness"—the home of Mr. Randolph in Goochland—then a long day's journey
                  brought them in sight of "Elmwood," the mansion of Mrs. Cary.</p>
               <p>On the horizon were seen "Blenheim," "Carysbrook," and other ancient mansions;
                  and, sparkling like a fallen star, with a last beam of the sun which fell upon its
                  windows, "Rivanna" crowning its lofty hill and dominating the whole region.</p>
               <p>This enchanting land of field and forest, through which ran sparkling like<pb
                     n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6141-00000014"/> threads of silver the Rivanna and its
                  affluents, was bounded in the west by the deep-blue mountain, extending from north
                  to south like a long surge of the ocean. Above it spread the purple flush of
                  sunset; against this exquisite background every azure crest stood out in clear
                  relief; and a flock of birds moving on slow wings amid the gray clouds, sunk down
                  toward the fairy-land of sunset.</p>
               <p>Innis gazed from the portico of "Elm-wood" at this beautiful scene—slowly turned
                  his eyes toward the lofty hill crowned by "Rivanna"—and murmured with a happy
                  smile: <q>
                     <l>"I shall see her soon!"</l>
                  </q>

               <head>X. HONORIA BRAND.</head>
               <p>INNIS yielded to the importunities of Phil Cary, and spent the night at Elm-wood;
                  but at sunrise was again in the saddle, and on his way to "Rivanna," where his
                  friend promised soon to join him.</p>
               <p>The variegated foliage was fresh, dewy, and sonorous with the "caw caw" of the
                  crows. That familiar sound struck on the ear of Innis with delight, and he went on
                  at a gallop, full of joy, reaching finally the summit of a hill within half a mile
                  of the old country-house. There he checked his horse, and looked for some moments
                  with admiration on the prospect. To the left were circling hills, abrupt, heavily
                  clothed with evergreens, and cut by the foaming current of a mountain-stream,
                  above which towered mighty masses of rock full of wild and picturesque beauty. In
                  front and to the right the ground trended off into charming slopes, dotted with
                  oaks and ash-trees, and a rustic bridge was thrown across the stream below. On a
                  commanding eminence beyond, standing proudly amid the great oaks of the extensive
                  grounds, was "Rivanna," with its white portico, broad wings, stacks of chimneys,
                  and long rows of quarters, the whole lit up by the gold of sunrise.</p>
               <p>Innis stopped for a few moments only. Something besides the landscape evidently
                  attracted him. He put spur to his horse, galloped down the hill, crossed the
                  bridge, and passed through a tall gate, with ornamental capitals on the posts,
                  into the grounds of the mansion. Suddenly he drew rein and uttered a joyous
                  exclamation.</p>
               <p>Within twenty paces of him stood a young lady, leaning against the trunk of one of
                  the great oaks, looking toward him, blushing a little, and smiling.</p>
               <p>Innis threw himself from the saddle rather than dismounted, and, hastening toward
                  the young lady, exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"Honoria!"</p>
               <p>She came toward him with her fresh cheeks just tinted with roses, pushing back
                  some brown curls from her forehead, and holding out a small hand.</p>
               <p>"I am very glad you have come back, Edmund," she said, simply.</p>
               <p>"And I am happy for the first time since I left you, Honoria."</p>
               <p>There was something ardent, earnest, and moving, in the voice of the speaker. His
                  companion did not blush, but a quick light filled the great soft eyes, and an
                  exquisite expression of happiness, at once trustful and timid, came to her
                  lips.</p>
               <p>The sunrise fell upon her as she stood thus, and seemed to caress her. She was not
                  more than eighteen, with a slender figure, which swayed naturally as she moved on
                  her little feet, and a complexion all lilies and roses. What was better than the
                  lilies and roses, the white neck bending like a swan's, and the whole physique of
                  this gracious creature, was the modesty of her glance and smile—a certain winning
                  sweetness—which said, "I am pure," as the snow says, "I am white."</p>
               <p>Her hand lay for a moment in that of Edmund Innis, and then was withdrawn, but
                  without affectation or mock prudery.</p>
               <p>As they walked up the hill, Innis leading his horse by the bridle, the feelings of
                  the youth were translated in his glances, which dwelt upon the fresh face beside
                  him with an expression which left nothing in doubt. Eager, tender, their light
                  veiled, as it were, by happiness, the eyes of the youth betrayed his secret.</p>
               <p>"When did you leave Williams-burg?"</p>
               <p>"Three days ago."</p>
               <p>"You came alone?"</p>
               <p>"With our friends of Elmwood."</p>
               <p>"That must have made the journey pleasant."</p>
               <p>"Very pleasant."</p>
               <p>Does the reader wish to have recorded any more of this thrilling conversation? I
                  spare him. Why should not youth and love play their parts unseen? Why repeat the
                  commonplaces under which the heart beats? The words uttered are nothing—the aim of
                  each is to hear the other's voice. So on this morning, full of sunshine, foliage,
                  freshness, and charm, the young man and the girl walked beside each other,
                  exchanging nothings, which were better than wit.</p>
               <p>A short walk beneath the great oaks, over a path gradually ascending, brought them
                  in front of the long porches of the great mansion.</p>
               <p>Innis entered, Honoria ran to announce his arrival to her mother, and the young
                  man went into the library.</p>
               <p>Before him sat, in a great arm-chair, Colonel Brand.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>XI. BIRTHS, DEATHS, AND MARRIAGES.</head>
               <p>OF "Rivanna" and its owner it is necessary to say a few words before proceeding
                  further in this narrative.</p>
               <p>The house had been built by Colonel Seaton, a prominent gentleman of the colony,
                  who, attracted by the beauty and fertility of the Piedmont country, had purchased
                  a great estate here, sent to England for workmen and materials, and erected this
                  fine mansion, at the then extremest limits of civilization.</p>
               <p>It is the hard fate of the rich to have some nail in the shoe. Colonel Seaton's
                  nail was the want of children. The great house was dreary without them; and when
                  one day he was informed that his brother and his sister had died, leaving each a
                  little girl without a home, he went and brought the children to Rivanna, adopted
                  them as his own, and, on the death of his wife some years afterward, gave his
                  whole attention to the task of rearing them as joint heiresses of his estate.</p>
               <p>The elder of the two cousins was his favorite in spite of her high-spirited and
                  somewhat restive character. But the moment came when this affection sustained a
                  heavy blow. The young girl married Mr. Edmund Innis, an amiable and honorable but
                  thriftless gentleman of the neighborhood; and Colonel Seaton, who had opposed the
                  alliance in every manner possible, made his niece a low bow, and informed her that
                  thenceforth they were to be strangers.</p>
               <p>The separation soon became more complete still. Colonel Seaton died. When his will
                  was opened it was found that he had left the great estate of Rivanna to his
                  younger niece, and to the eldest nothing.</p>
               <p>The younger was thus a great heiress, and suitors promptly appeared. None,
                  however, pleased the young lady, and, weary of the wilderness, she went to spend
                  the winter in Williamsburg.</p>
               <p>There her fate met her. Mr. Brand, of an ancient family and a great estate, paid
                  his addresses. He was handsome, he was courtly, he had made the grand tour, he
                  threw his money about in the grandest style; and, until his marriage<pb n="26-27"
                     xml:id="VAC6141-00000015"/> with the young lady, which in due time took place,
                  it was not discovered that the splendid suitor was bankrupt; his luxury and
                  seeming affluence a hollow shell, covering—hopeless debt. His wealthy marriage,
                  however, rescued him from ruin; his old associates lost sight of him; he had
                  become a staid and imposing personage—the worshipful Colonel Brand, of
                  Rivanna.</p>
               <p>Years passed, and two daughters were born to Colonel Brand; when this history
                  opens they were approaching womanhood. Meanwhile, the elder cousin, Mrs. Innis,
                  gradually saw poverty closing in upon her. Her husband was a gentleman of the
                  highest character, but belonged to that class of persons with whom every thing
                  fails. Some men have only to touch lead to turn it to gold. Mr. Innis had only to
                  touch gold to turn it into lead. He had possessed a considerable property—as he
                  advanced in life it dwindled. In ten years more, he would have been thrown
                  homeless on the world, when, fortunately or unfortunately, he died, leaving his
                  widow with an only son, and in possession of but a small remnant of the once ample
                  estate of the Innises.</p>
               <p>What is it that a mother does when her husband dies, leaving her with one darling
                  child only? She almost always spoils the child: and Mrs. Innis did all in her
                  power to spoil Edmund. She did not succeed. There was something in the boy too
                  proud, intelligent, and noble, to be warped; and, when his mother died, in his
                  eighteenth year, clasping him with her last remains of strength to her poor heart,
                  she left him simple, sweet-tempered, and unselfish.</p>
               <p>The hard hand of loneliness thus came to press upon the boy, as he touched the
                  threshold of manhood. Immured in his little house, resembling rather a
                  hunting-lodge than a dwelling, in a gash of the mountain, he saw far beneath him
                  in the plain, "Rivanna," "Carysbrook," "Castlehill," and the happy homes of happy
                  families, while one or two old servants, who would not desert him, were the only
                  human beings near him, and a few books were his only other company. Then a new
                  resource suddenly presented itself.</p>
               <p>The cousins—his mother and Lady Brand, as the wife of the lordly colonel was
                  colloquially called, in accordance with a usage not uncommon in colonial
                  Virginia—had had no intercourse. This, it must be said, was the fault of Mrs.
                  Innis, who, proud, sensitive, and high-spirited, would respond to no overtures,
                  and resolutely declined intercourse with those who had spoken ill, she believed,
                  of her husband. Death had come now to heal this breach. The sod had scarce closed
                  over the poor lady, when Lady Brand came in her coach up the mountain-road—entered
                  the little house—went up to Edmund, who was about to receive her with a bow, and,
                  clasping her arms around him, kissed him, and said, with tears in her eyes:</p>
               <p>"My poor child, you must not stay here in your solitary home. You are my blood,
                  and I love you very much, as I loved dear Anna. You must love me a little in
                  return."</p>
               <p>Thereat the boy melted, and sobbed in the good lady's arms.</p>
               <p>An hour afterward they were at "Rivanna," and Edmund saw two young ladies of
                  twelve and fourteen come toward him, offering their lips—in accordance with
                  instructions—to their cousin.</p>
               <p>Thenceforth the life of Innis changed. A large part of his time was spent at
                  Rivanna; and, in course of years, he found it wellnigh impossible to remain
                  absent. The girl of twelve became the maiden of fifteen, then the young lady of
                  eighteen; and Innis passionately loved her. Grave, calm, and serene in manner, the
                  youth possessed strong impulses and ardent aspirations. Solitude grew distasteful,
                  books wearied him—Honoria was ever before his eyes; and, mounting his
                  thorough-bred, one of the few luxuries left him, he would go to Rivanna, spend
                  whole days, and drink deeper and deeper draughts of that most intoxicating of
                  beverages—first love!</p>
               <p>Nothing hitherto had come to mar his happiness. Lady Brand, whom he called "aunt,"
                  received him always with the tenderest affection; Lou, the elder of the two girls,
                  was his warm friend, and even the stiff colonel made him stately bows, and
                  overwhelmed him with distinguished consideration—for the colonel was given to
                  "deportment."</p>
               <p>Of Honoria's feelings, the narrative will present a fuller view than is here
                  possible. A few words more will convey a correct conception of Innis's situation
                  and plans when our history commences.</p>
               <p>He was twenty-three—passionately in love with his cousin, the daughter of a
                  gentleman of large wealth—poor, and doing nothing. At that thought the very soul
                  of Innis revolted within him. He thought with bitterness of his probable future—of
                  visiting Rivanna thus, year after year, in the character of a "poor relation"—of
                  one day seeing Honoria give her hand to some glittering youth, forgetting him; and
                  of growing old, uncared for, and forgotten in his lonely lodge, buried in its
                  lugubrious pines. That thought had come day after day to cut Innis like a sharp
                  blade to the very heart. His once ruddy cheek grow pale with bitter meditation.
                  With the prejudice of race, at that time prevalent, he shrank from trade—he had no
                  means to enter the professions—what was left him but to mope and dream, growing
                  gray and sombre in his sombre dwelling—bending lower year by year beneath the
                  inexorable weight which bows the strongest shoulders toward the tomb?</p>
               <p>These thoughts preyed upon him, as the worm preys on the bud, and his cheeks grew
                  so pale that Lady Brand said one day:</p>
               <p>"You are pining, Edmund; what is the reason?"</p>
               <p>"I am twenty-three, and am doing nothing, aunt."</p>
               <p>"Well, why remain idle?"</p>
               <p>"What can I do?"</p>
               <p>"Make yourself the first counsellor in the colony—you have the intellect."</p>
               <p>Innis felt his pulse throb. Then his head sunk.</p>
               <p>"I cannot, aunt. I have no means to study."</p>
               <p>Lady Brand smiled.</p>
               <p>"Listen, Edmund: my connection, Mr. Wythe, at Williamsburg, wishes a young
                  gentleman in his office; he is growing old, and requires assistance in
                  transcribing his law-papers. He will receive you into his house as one of the
                  family gladly, in return for your services, and instruct you in law besides—"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Me,</emph> aunt?"</p>
               <p>"I say <emph>you,</emph> my child, because he offers to do so in this letter."</p>
               <p>She looked at him with her kind eyes and smile, holding toward him the letter.</p>
               <p>"Why should I not scheme to set my boy up in the world, like other people?"</p>
               <p>Innis had his arms around her, ere she had finished, and kissed her.</p>
               <p>"Dear aunt!—you are very good to me!"</p>
               <p>"Don't thank me for only doing my duty, Edmund. And now, I think it best that you
                  should go and see Mr. Wythe."</p>
               <p>"I will set out to-morrow, aunt. Oh, I assure you, I am not disposed to
                  delay."</p>
               <p>"I will give you an early breakfast, then, my son; and may God guide you!"</p>
               <p>On the very next day Innis was, accordingly, on his way to Williamsburg, which he
                  reached in due time. The venerable Mr. Wythe greeted him cordially. It was
                  arranged that he should come to<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6141-00000016"/> live in
                  his office on the first of the ensuing January, and Innis returned, as the reader
                  has seen.</p>
               <p>What befell him in Williamsburg has been recorded; what occurred on his return
                  will now be related.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>XII. AT RIVANNA.</head>
               <p>COLONEL BRAND was seated in his large arm-chair of carved oak, with
                  Spanish-leather covering—a tall and portly individual, ruddy of face from high
                  living, with gray side-whiskers, and formal air, and clad in imposing costume. His
                  face and bearing said: "I am the lord of the manor; you common people will be good
                  enough to bow down to me!" He even held the number of the <title>Virginia
                     Gazette</title> which he was reading with a stately air, as of a superior
                  mortal, who performed an act of condescension in perusing what common people had
                  written.</p>
               <p>Innis entered, and, approaching, bowed to the colonel, who rose slowly—for it was
                  a part of his social philosophy never to omit any form of courtesy—and grandly
                  held out two fingers. Innis took them; the colonel submitted to the ceremony
                  without responding in any manner to the pressure bestowed upon the two digits; and
                  then came, in stiff and formal tones:</p>
               <p>"You have just returned from the capital, I believe?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," replied Innis, taking the seat which the colonel indicated with a
                  stately wave of the hand.</p>
               <p>"Hum!"</p>
               <p>The colonel cleared his throat in a formal manner, and resumed his seat.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you bring some intelligence of interest," he said, raising his chin, and
                  slowly passing his jewelled hand beneath that portion of his person.</p>
               <p>"Scarcely any thing, sir," replied Innis; "my stay, as you know, was brief."</p>
               <p>Colonel Brand made an inclination with his head, as though to protest against
                  being supposed to remember, or be aware of, a fact so very unimportant as the
                  duration of the young man's absence.</p>
               <p>"His excellency is well, I trust?"</p>
               <p>"I believe so, sir."</p>
               <p>"You saw him?"</p>
               <p>"I did not, sir, except when he was passing to his coach one day."</p>
               <p>"I have the honor to enjoy his lordship's acquaintance. You saw none of the
                  council or his excellency's suite?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir—I chanced to make the acquaintance of Lord Ruthven, his secretary."</p>
               <p>"Lord Ruthven?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir; a nobleman from Scotland, I believe."</p>
               <p>The colonel seemed suddenly interested.</p>
               <p>"A gentleman of—let me see—hum I from sixty-five to seventy?"</p>
               <p>"Scarce as old as forty, I think, sir."</p>
               <p>"Then 'tis not my Lord Ruthven of Perthshire."</p>
               <p>"You knew his lordship, sir?"</p>
               <p>"Well—indeed—hum!—I may speak of his lordship as my personal friend, and I possess
                  and highly value a portrait of him which I have—his own gift."</p>
               <p>"The Lord Ruthven of his excellency's suite may be the elder nobleman's son."</p>
               <p>"True; what is his personal appearance?"</p>
               <p>"Very pale, with black hair and eyes, and of grave demeanor."</p>
               <p>"The same; no doubt 'tis the son of the elder lord, who may have died
                  recently."</p>
               <p>Innis looked around for the portrait of the elder Lord Ruthven; it was nowhere to
                  be seen.</p>
               <p>Colonel Brand seemed to have dismissed the subject. With imposing gravity he
                  began:</p>
               <p>"The intelligence from England, I perceive, sir—hum!—" when, unfortunately for his
                  stately discourse, the breakfast-bell rang; and, rising, the colonel approached
                  the door, and, moving slightly aside, waved his hand for Innis to precede him.</p>
               <p>"After you, sir," said the youth, courteously.</p>
               <p>"I beg you will proceed, sir," said the colonel, with stately condescension.</p>
               <p>Innis smiled and obeyed. They entered the breakfast-room, and a tall, elderly
                  lady, very graceful and attractive still, came from behind the urn, and, putting
                  her arms around the youth, kissed him affectionately.</p>
               <p>Then Miss Lou Brand, tall like her mother, with dancing, hazel eyes, a superb
                  complexion, dazzling teeth between rosy lips, and an air of gayety, mischief, and
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">abandon,</foreign> came and greeted him warmly. Honoria
                  entered and took her place, and breakfast proceeded.</p>
               <p>"Where is Meta, aunt?" said Innis to Lady Brand.</p>
               <p>"I have no idea, Edmund; not making her toilet, for she is an earlier riser than
                  any one in the household."</p>
               <p>"I fancied I saw her at one of the windows as I came up the hill."</p>
               <p>A species of inarticulate murmur was heard behind the youth; he turned quickly. On
                  the threshold of the apartment stood a singular figure.</p>
               <p>The new-comer was a girl, apparently about fifteen, of very extraordinary beauty,
                  but with something wild and elfish in her appearance. She wore a dress of the most
                  brilliant and variegated colors, and superb dark hair fell in huge masses of curls
                  upon both shoulders. Her eyes were dark, subtile, and penetrating, and were fixed
                  intently upon Innis.</p>
               <p>He rose quickly, and went and held out his hand, with a smile, saying:</p>
               <p>"How do you do, Meta?"</p>
               <p>The girl coldly refused the hand, and, without uttering a sound, went to her place
                  at the table.</p>
               <p>"Something has offended Meta," said Lady Brand, in a low tone.—"Do not take any
                  notice of her, Edmund; it is the best way."</p>
               <p>The youth resumed his seat; breakfast went upon its way; the stately lord of the
                  manor rose and returned to the library; and an hour afterward Innis was seated in
                  his aunt's chamber, informing her of the fortunate results of his journey. He had
                  made every arrangement to enter Mr. Wythe's office on the first of January.</p>
               <p>"Heaven be thanked that you have been so fortunate, my son!" said the worthy lady,
                  busily knitting in her great chair; for, like a good Virginia housewife, she would
                  never remain idle. "Now your career in life is open to you. By assiduous study you
                  may become, not only prosperous but distinguished; and your old aunt will be as
                  happy as yourself."</p>
               <p>"Dear aunt," said the youth, warmly, "how good you are to me! One would really
                  suppose that I was somebody."</p>
               <p>"You are of our blood, and that is very good blood, too, Edmund."</p>
               <p>"But I am very poor."</p>
               <p>"That is of all human things the least important to a young man—it is a spur to
                  exertion."</p>
               <p>"But, in case I were to—fall in love—aunt?"</p>
               <p>"Do not do so yet, Edmund. There is time enough for that, as my friend Mrs. Cary
                  is always telling Phil."</p>
               <p>Innis sighed.</p>
               <p>"I suppose you are right, aunt; but, in case I were to find my affections
                  engaged—to love some one—then poverty would be a serious bar, I fear."</p>
               <p>"Why should it, if you are energetic and make your way? Two sorts of wealth exist
                  in this world, Edmund—property and intellect. If your intellect brings you
                  revenue, is it not as valuable as landed estate, which can do no more?"</p>
               <p>"The land is much more certain,<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6141-00000017"/> aunt; but
                  we are wandering very far. You see I am quite fortunate now, and, thanks to you,
                  have something to look forward to. Let me tell you of my adventures."</p>
               <p>And Innis related the incidents connected with Lord Ruthven, suppressing, however,
                  as he had promised, all allusion to the singular words of the nobleman.</p>
               <p>"That was unfortunate, Edmund, but in this world we must not regret too strongly
                  what we cannot help. You had no intention to injure Lord Ruthven, and,
                  fortunately, he has recovered. These accidents are sometimes truly unhappy. Meta,
                  you know, owes her loss of reason to a similar fall."</p>
               <p>"Is it possible, aunt?"</p>
               <p>"Did you not know it?"</p>
               <p>"Strangely enough, I did not."</p>
               <p>"We rarely allude to it, and never in her presence, as it agitates her
                  frightfully. Meta, you know, is the only daughter of a cousin of my uncle, Colonel
                  Seaton. Her father and mother are both dead, and we have only done our duty in
                  taking the poor orphan to our arms. She came to us in her present condition—dumb
                  and bereft of sense. When about ten years of age, she one day mounted a spirited
                  young horse; the animal ran away and threw her to the ground, and in falling her
                  head struck a sharp stone, which, it is supposed, drove a portion of bone in upon
                  her brain. When she recovered from her fall the poor child had lost her reason.
                  Truly, the ways of Providence are past finding out. And now don't let me detain
                  you, Edmund. Old people must not monopolize young people; and yonder comes Philip
                  Cary, a great rattle-trap, but a young man for whom I have much regard. Come back
                  during the evening—I like to see as much of my boy as I can. You know we must soon
                  part."</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>XIII. THE PORTRAIT.</head>
               <p>REPLYING to this speech of the good lady by an affectionate glance, Innis rose,
                  left the chamber, and went toward the staircase leading to the lower floor.</p>
               <p>As he did so, he perceived that the door of a small apartment, the private
                  dressing-room of Colonel Brand, which few persons ever entered, was half open.
                  Glancing idly through the opening, he found his attention suddenly arrested by a
                  portrait on the opposite wall.</p>
               <p>This portrait was the most perfect, the most astonishing likeness of the Lord
                  Ruthven of Williamsburg: the pale face, with its black hair and eyes, seemed
                  starting from the canvas, and about to speak to him.</p>
               <p>Innis advanced a step, and looked long and intently at the picture.</p>
               <p>"The very face!" he said.</p>
               <p>And, returning to Lady Brand's chamber, he said:</p>
               <p>"Aunt, whose portrait hangs in the dressing-room?"</p>
               <p>"That with the white face and black locks, Edmund?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, aunt."</p>
               <p>"'Tis the picture of Lord Ruthven, of Scotland, a former friend of Colonel
                  Brand's."</p>
               <p>"Strange that I never before saw it."</p>
               <p>"And yet the explanation is simple, my son. The portrait originally hung in the
                  hall down-stairs, but the face gave me a chill."</p>
               <p>"A chill?"</p>
               <p>"It seemed to haunt me, with its deep, dark, melancholy eyes—its ghostly stare. So
                  I begged Colonel Brand to remove it; he complied with my request, and it hangs
                  now, you see, in his private apartment."</p>
               <p>Innis nodded.</p>
               <p>"It has had a strange effect upon me too, aunt. The resemblance is striking to the
                  Lord Ruthven I met with in Williamsburg."</p>
               <p>"Ah, indeed?"</p>
               <p>"Yes aunt—the same haunting expression in the eyes of the portrait is reproduced
                  in the eyes of the son."</p>
               <p>"The son?"</p>
               <p>"Doubtless, my Williamsburg acquaintance is a son of the elder lord."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes—that explains the likeness. These resemblances of father and son are
                  sometimes truly extraordinary. I remember, when young Mr. Harrison came to see us,
                  I was so much astonished by his likeness to his father—"</p>
               <p>And Lady Brand plunged into a story, all about young Mr. Harrison, his father, who
                  had once been a <emph>very</emph> intimate friend of hers, and other persons
                  connected with them.</p>
               <p>We shall not inflict the good lady's reminiscences upon the reader. When the
                  narrative was concluded, Innis rose, left the apartment, stopped again in front of
                  Colonel Brand's dressing-room, to look at the portrait, and then went down the
                  stairs, murmuring:</p>
               <p>"I could swear that this was <emph>my</emph> Lord Ruthven—or his ghost!"</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>XIV. META.</head>
               <p>INNIS found his friend Phil Cary upon the portico, engaged in a word-combat with
                  his intimate enemy, Miss Lou Brand, between whom and himself existed relations of
                  permanent hostility—or very great liking—it was difficult to say which.</p>
               <p>They certainly struck fire, like steel and flint, whenever they met; but then they
                  apparently could not remain away from each other; gravitated as it were together;
                  and were much too aggressive and provoking to be indifferent.</p>
               <p>That excellent class of persons who take charge of the affairs of their
                  neighborhoods, said that Miss Lou Brand was extremely fond of Mr. Phil Cary, but
                  had confidentially announced, in the secrecy of female friendship, that she
                  intended to "give him a lesson." Mr. Phil Cary, on the other hand, was said to be
                  aware of this dire resolve on the part of his enemy, and to shape his course with
                  great skill in accordance therewith—proceeding in his attentions just far enough
                  to provoke and tantalize Miss Brand, but carefully refraining, with covert
                  enjoyment of the joke, from an avowal. Such were the relations of the young
                  people—circumstances would doubtless determine the result; meanwhile, they laughed
                  at each other, held each other up to ridicule, and invariably sought out each
                  other in society.</p>
               <p>Innis smiled as he passed them, and, inviting his friend to come and see him,
                  mounted his horse.</p>
               <p>"Remember the party on Wednesday!" Miss Lou called out.</p>
               <p>"The party?" said Innis.</p>
               <p>"Haven't you heard of it? We expect to have half a dozen girls; they will stay for
                  a week, and we intend to turn night into day!—it will be delightful!"</p>
               <p>"Turning night into day?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir! why not? Day is so stupid."</p>
               <p>"And then the fairer portion of creation look so much better by lamplight," said
                  Mr. Cary, meekly.</p>
               <p>The young lady turned upon him instantly.</p>
               <p>"Why should not girls turn night into day, if they fancy?"</p>
               <p>"Why not?" echoed Mr. Phil Cary—"they do nothing."</p>
               <p>"They sew, sir!—and that is better than passing the time in idleness, or eternally
                  hunting, hunting, as is the practice of some people."</p>
               <p>"Do you really sew?" said Mr. Cary, with interest.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir; as your lordship is aware,<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6141-00000018"/> we
                  are the weaker species of vessels, and—"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, I had lost sight of that," interrupted Mr. Phil Cary; "You therefore
                  sew, and—am I wrong in supposing that you occasionally talk?"</p>
               <p>"Wearisome!"</p>
               <p>And, turning her back on Mr. Cary, Miss Brand returned Innis's bow, and said:</p>
               <p>"Be sure to come on Wednesday, and stay for a week at least, Edmund. We intend to
                  have a charming time, and to <emph>eat the dumb-cake.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"What is that, cousin?"</p>
               <p>"A secret."</p>
               <p>A smothered laugh behind the young lady excited her sudden indignation.</p>
               <p>"I don't believe there is any secret," said Phil Cary, with much frankness; "women
                  never keep secrets."</p>
               <p>What followed this renewal of the assault, Innis did not observe; he left the foes
                  in the midst of their altercation, and rode down the hill. As he went along
                  slowly, his lips wore a faint smile, and his face was a little flushed. He was
                  thinking of Honoria. In his absence, she had grown dearer far to him than before.
                  Now, he would see her again for a few weeks—then he would leave her; time, change,
                  vicissitude, would work their will on each. When should he see her again, if he
                  ever saw her?</p>
               <p>The young man was going along, buried in these thoughts, his eyes fixed upon the
                  ground, when suddenly his horse shied so violently that he was nearly
                  unseated.</p>
               <p>The origin of this fright on the part of the animal was the occurrence of a very
                  singular incident. From the great oak, beneath which he had been passing, had
                  suddenly fallen, within five paces, the figure of the girl Meta. A sort of rustic
                  bower in this great, wide-armed tree, was indeed a favorite haunt of the elf-like
                  maiden; her singular agility enabled her to mount without difficulty to her
                  hiding-place; and here, cradled in foliage, she would spend hour after hour,
                  gazing at the sky, the passing clouds, listening to the twitter of the birds amid
                  the leaves, or baring her brow to the cooling breeze. As Innis passed, she had
                  swung from a drooping bough, falling as lightly as a cat to the turf beneath, and
                  now stood looking at him with her singularly-piercing eyes framed in the masses of
                  black curls descending to and nearly covering her shoulders.</p>
               <p>The expression of the beautiful face was strange. Anger, regret, tenderness—all
                  passed in turn over the telltale countenance, which at certain moments reflected
                  what was passing in Meta's breast so plainly that words were unnecessary. Words,
                  indeed, the girl had none. Bereft alike of speech and reason, this poor girl was
                  nearly cut off by her misfortune from all the life around her. She had succeeded,
                  however, in making for herself a species of language of signs and gestures—Innis
                  understood in a measure these signs—and, as the girl now began to gesticulate with
                  singular energy, he understood that she was expressing regret for her cold
                  reception of him upon his arrival.</p>
               <p>Innis looked at the young face, filled with its conflicting emotions, and an
                  expression of pitying kindness came to his own.</p>
               <p>"It was nothing, Meta," he said; "I was a little surprised, 'tis true. I am not
                  hurt, however, and will not even ask you why you thus received me. I am sure of
                  your affection for me, and you know my affection for you."</p>
               <p>The head sank quickly, and tears came to the girl's eyes. She uttered some
                  inarticulate sounds, blushed, trembled, then with a quick movement seized the
                  young man's hand and kissed it.</p>
               <p>A few moments afterward she had disappeared, running with inconceivable rapidity
                  into the deepest shades of the park.</p>
               <p>Innis looked after her, shook his head with a pitying sigh, and rode on.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>XV. TWO PICTURES.</head>
               <p>A RIDE of a few miles brought Innis to his little hunting-lodge, perched on a
                  knoll in a gash, of the mountain, and overshadowed by haughty pines.</p>
               <p>An old man-servant, bowed down with age, came with a pleasant smile to greet him,
                  and take his horse. Some kind words, indicative of affection on the part of each
                  for the other, were exchanged; and Innis entered the little dwelling, where a
                  bright fire burned upon the hearth, sat down, opened a book, and appeared to be
                  reading. In a few moments the book sank on his knee, his eyes were fixed upon the
                  fire, and his thoughts flew far away from his little mountain-lodge to the lowland
                  and Honoria.</p>
               <p>He approached now a crisis in his life, when, perhaps, a few months would decide
                  his future. Could he make something of himself, or was he doomed to vegetate thus
                  forever in obscurity? No! He would not rust away thus, his fresh years fading to
                  the yellow leaf—alone, unknown, a mere atom, and even of less importance than an
                  atom in the universe.</p>
               <p>"No," he said, finally, gazing around him at the small apartment, with its plain,
                  almost rude appurtenances, which the firelight fell upon. "No, I cannot live here
                  forever, with no one to love me, a mere nobody in the world. I will study, work,
                  make something of myself. I may succeed as others have succeeded—rise in the
                  profession of the law—three or four years hence I may go to the House of
                  Burgesses—she will then be scarcely more than twenty—and—"</p>
               <p>With this "and" he stopped. A blush covered the youth's cheeks, and his head sank.
                  Falling into reverie again, he fixed his eyes upon the fire, and remained silent.
                  Was his imagination painting some brilliant future—the picture of himself,
                  prominent, wealthy, honored, and married to Honoria?</p>
               <p>"In three or four years," he murmured—"that is not so long—then—then—who
                  knows?"</p>
               <p>The old, old story!—the tale that is told of all the generations of humanity!</p>
               <p>And at that very moment, Honoria, leaning her forehead on her hand, and looking
                  out into the fine October night, was thinking of him. He was her young hero—the
                  beloved of her fresh young heart. To Edmund Innis all her thoughts flowed, and her
                  meditations were filled with bitter pleasure—a species of delicious pain.</p>
               <p>For Honoria, too, realized that the hour approached when her relations with Innis
                  must undergo a change. What is it that one day suddenly tells the maiden of
                  seventeen that the youth who has hitherto been to her but a cousin and favorite
                  playmate, has become a lover? Then the old world of cousinship is dead, the new
                  world of first love appears, all flowers, and sunshine, where the happy breezes
                  whisper their exquisite secrets. It was plain to Honoria, as she sat sunk in
                  reverie, with blushing cheeks, that Edmund was beginning to love her. His glance
                  had revealed all, and she must take care how she treated him henceforth.</p>
               <p>She did not love him! Oh! no, no!—and the fact seemed very sorrowful, for Honoria
                  uttered piteous sigh. She loved him, of course, as her cousin, dearly—yes,
                     <emph>very</emph> dearly—and why should she not? It was natural. He was so kind
                  and generous and noble! So free from any thing mean or little. This was the origin
                  of her liking. The fact that he was extremely handsome, the most graceful and
                  elegant of all the gentlemen<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6141-00000019"/> of her
                  acquaintance—this had no weight with her, not the least! She loved him—yes! she
                  did love him—as her cousin—for his goodness of heart; and she must be cold,
                  indeed, not to do so—but—that was all! He was simply a favorite cousin, and—he was
                  falling in love with her!</p>
               <p>What should she do? Permit him to deceive himself, perhaps, and grow unhappy? Oh,
                  no! If she loved him as her friend and cousin, she should show it now by
                  refraining from her former marks of affection, and discouraging him on the
                  threshold. Yes, that was her bounden duty—she would resolutely perform it; and,
                  having come to this resolution, Honoria sighed profoundly.</p>
               <p>All at once a quick blush rushed to her cheeks, and tears overflowed her eyes.</p>
               <p>"Edmund would never be so unjust," she murmured.</p>
               <p>The quick thought had come to her that the young man might attribute her sudden
                  coolness to the difference in point of wealth—to his poverty. His poverty! As if
                  that could make any difference with <emph>her!</emph> She loved him a thousand
                  times more for his poverty. The noblest men of history had been proud to be poor;
                  and had found in high thoughts, the affections of the heart, and honorable toil,
                  the noblest source of happiness. Edmund Innis might be poor in worldly goods, but
                  he was rich in all else—in truth, honor, grace, sweetness, whatever best became a
                  gentleman! His very worn and discolored coat became him better than the silks and
                  velvets of others. His hat might be frayed and old, but when he bowed before a
                  lady it was like a prince's coronet. And even his poverty was only a fancy. Why
                  was not his small house as desirable as "Blenheim" or "Rivanna?" Why think that
                  splendor and imposing luxury are desirable in this world? It was very pretty, this
                  little lodge, perched on its knoll beneath the great pines. The proudest girl in
                  all Virginia might be happy to live there—with Edmund!</p>
               <p>A quick, guilty blush came to the cheeks of the girl. Her reverie had led her to a
                  point where suddenly she recoiled.</p>
               <p>"No, no!" she murmured; "I did not mean that! I was dreaming day-dreams—fancies—I
                  am very foolish. Edmund is nothing to me; and my pride, perhaps, makes me think I
                  am aught to him. I hope I am not—"</p>
               <p>A piteous sigh whispered through the words.</p>
               <p>"I am mistaken, I suppose; and even if—poor fellow! how could I bear it—his
                  distress? But the young girls in Williamsburg are very beautiful, they say. If he
                  loves me, I hope he will soon find one who will make him forget me. That would
                  make me very, <emph>very happy!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>And leaning her forehead on the window-sill, Honoria uttered a low sob.</p>
               <p>The old, old story! The tale that is told of all the generations of humanity!</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>XVI. TWO HEARTS.</head>
               <p>FROM his lonely mountain-lodge, where no sound disturbed the silence but the low
                  murmur of the great pines, Innis passed to the stately halls of "Rivanna," where a
                  party of youths and maidens filled the days and nights with uproar, revelry, and
                  laughter.</p>
               <p>He was warmly welcomed by the young ladies and the gallants, assembled at the
                  hospitable mansion—then he looked for Honoria.</p>
               <p>The young lady was not visible. The result of that sorrowful reverie, which we
                  have partially described, had been that Honoria had resolved not to
                     <emph>encourage</emph> the youth; that is, to receive him, if she received him
                  at all, with some-thing loss than ordinary politeness; and, by way of inaugurating
                  this auspicious programme, she did not leave her apartment, although she saw him
                  plainly as he came up the hill.</p>
               <p>Innis acted with decision—or he was fortunate. Having spoken to his friends, he
                  went straight to Lady Brand's chamber, and there he found Honoria.</p>
               <p>As he entered, the girl's face flashed, and her lip quivered. Then she suppressed
                  these evidences of emotion; raised her head with stately politeness, and bowed to
                  him with common courtesy—nothing more.</p>
               <p>This reception struck Innis like a blow. He became crimson, bowed low, and then
                  stood in an attitude almost haughty before the girl, not uttering a word.</p>
               <p>Lady Brand looked at them in perfect bewilderment.</p>
               <p>"Why, what is the matter with you, Honoria; and with you, Edmund?" she
                  exclaimed.</p>
               <p>"Nothing, mamma," said Honoria, in a trembling voice.</p>
               <p>"Nothing, aunt," repeated Innis.</p>
               <p>"But something <emph>is</emph> the matter," continued Lady Brand. "I insist upon
                  an explanation. These misunderstandings are perfectly absurd; why do not people go
                  and have an explanation at once, when they fall out?—What is it, Honoria?"</p>
               <p>"Don't ask me, mamma!" exclaimed Honoria, suppressing with the utmost difficulty a
                  burst of tears. "I have no explanation to make; no fault to find with
                  anybody!"</p>
               <p>And, rising quickly, she hurried from the apartment.</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, Edmund?" asked Lady Brand, profoundly mystified.</p>
               <p>"I do not know, aunt," said Innis, calmly; "you know that young ladies are subject
                  to nervous fancies—Honoria will soon recover; I think I shall go down now, and pay
                  my respects, to the company."</p>
               <p>He turned away as he spoke, descended to the drawing-room, and, retiring to a
                  shaded recess, leaned upon the window-sill, and surrendered himself to bitter
                  meditation.</p>
               <p>He was thus engaged when he heard a step at the door of the apartment, and the ear
                  of the lover told him that it was Honoria's. A moment afterward, he heard her gay
                  voice as she addressed the gentlemen; there was no agitation whatever in its
                  tones: Innis had to deal with a woman perfect in all the lessons of her sex.</p>
               <p>He did not turn, until, as the party of youths and young ladies were going to
                  stroll on the lawn, Phil Cary cried out!</p>
               <p>"Wake up there, old fellow, and come and walk!"</p>
               <p>Innis shook his head.</p>
               <p>"That will never do, Mr. Innis!" exclaimed an impulsive young lady, the "romp" of
                  the party; "come this 'moment and walk with me, sir!"</p>
               <p>Refusal was no longer possible. With an internal opinion of the damsel which would
                  by no means have flattered her <foreign xml:lang="FRA">amour-propre</foreign> he
                  rose, offered his arm, and, a moment afterward, the "romp" had seized the arm of
                  Honoria, dragging both Innis and the latter forth beneath the great oaks.</p>
               <p>Much injustice is done the class of young ladies called "romps;" what they lack in
                  ceremony they make up often in warmth of heart. This one saw that Innis had no
                  eyes for any one but Honoria; she brought them together; then she heard some one
                  call her, or pretended to hear, and quickly retired, smiling sweetly upon the
                  young man, who was thus left with Honoria.</p>
               <p>For some moments it seemed that this good fortune would have no results. Innis
                  found himself walking beside a maiden who blushed a little, but exhibited no other
                  indication of emotion; one who was determined to converse upon<pb n="36-37"
                     xml:id="VAC6141-00000020"/> the subject of the weather, and explain
                  nothing.</p>
               <p>For nearly an hour be tried vainly to direct the conversation to this topic—the
                  alteration in the young lady's demeanor. She incessantly evaded the subject;
                  foiled him at every turn; and preserved her self-possession.</p>
               <p>Innis stopped, raised his eyes from the ground upon which they had been fixed, and
                  for a moment gazed with a long and searching look upon the girl.</p>
               <p>"So be it, Honoria," he said, with sorrowful composure, and an accent both of
                  grief and pride; "my pains, I see, are thrown away. You avoid uttering the few
                  simple words I wish to hear. You are changed to me."</p>
               <p>He could not suppress a species of groan. It was hard to feel hope leaving
                  him.</p>
               <p>"I thought you had some—affection—for me, once. Had you not? But we will not speak
                  of that. Do not reply. You had this affection, and are altered to me, refusing to
                  explain why; or you had none, and do not feign. So be it, once more. You shall not
                  be annoyed by my wretched importunity—by this love—yes, love!—which wellnigh
                  unmans me. Oh, it is hard! very hard to—Your gay company shall not be made gloomy
                  by my miserable face. I will go—in an hour I shall leave Rivanna—and forever!"</p>
               <p>She raised her head with a startled look, and gazed at him. Her cheeks were pale,
                  and her eyes swam in sudden tears.</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, no!" she exclaimed, impulsively, "you must not go!"</p>
               <p>A guilty blush instantly drove away the pallor of her cheeks.</p>
               <p>"That is to say—I mean—"</p>
               <p>There the low voice died away, and a sob issued from the trembling lips. A moment
                  had reversed every thing. It was Honoria who pleaded—Innis who was calm. His pride
                  had come to his assistance.</p>
               <p>"You are cold to me, or angry with me," he said, in a firm voice; "what course
                  therefore remains for me, but to—"</p>
               <p>"No, no—not cold—not angry!" She placed her handkerchief to her eyes, and
                  murmured: "But it is best that we should not—" The words ended in another sob.</p>
               <p>"Should not what?" exclaimed the youth, seizing her hand; "speak, Honoria! What
                  mystery is this? You can trust me, can you not? You loved me a little, once—did
                  you not—as your poor cousin, at least?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, yes! Heaven is my witness—faithfully—and I act now from—affection for
                  you!"</p>
               <p>The words were uttered in a broken and trembling voice. Honoria leaned against the
                  trunk of the oak, beneath which they stood apart from the gay groups, and her
                  whole frame was convulsed.</p>
               <p>Innis pressed the hand which he still held, with vehemence, and exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Speak, Honoria! what means this? You act thus from <emph>affection?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>That</emph> prompts you to treat me thus—coldly?"</p>
               <p>"Yes!"</p>
               <p>The youth was silent for a moment, lost in wonder; then his face grew suddenly
                  pale, and an expression of intense bitterness came to his lips. He dropped the
                  hand of the girl.</p>
               <p>"I now understand!" he said, raising his head with cold pride.</p>
               <p>"You understand?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," he said; "yes, there is no longer any mystery to solve, Honoria. You are a
                  woman—one of the best of them—but, after all, you are a woman."</p>
               <p>He looked at her coldly and mournfully.</p>
               <p>"You have reflected upon the difference ence of our conditions," he went on; "you
                  have realized how broad a gulf separates the poor young man, obscure, and alone in
                  the world, where he is nothing, from the beautiful young heiress whom all conspire
                  to flatter—"</p>
               <p>"Edmund!" she exclaimed, wildly, "oh, you must not, shall not—"</p>
               <p>"Alas!" he said, with the same proud sorrow in voice and countenance, "it is
                  true—too true! I can understand that good-breeding prompts you to deny the charge;
                  it is possible, even, that you are unwilling to wound your poor cousin—your friend
                  and playmate—who has loved you so long and faithfully!"</p>
               <p>"Edmund, Edmund!" she exclaimed, "this is ungenerous—cruel, terrible
                  injustice!"</p>
               <p>He shook his head slowly.</p>
               <p>"I would not be cruel—alas! I cannot. It is the woful truth, which I have the
                  courage to tell you, because I am about to leave you, and my heart is breaking!
                  You have found at last, my poor darling—let me call you so, it is the first time
                  and the last time—you have found that the present cannot be like the past, because
                  the world has its claims upon you. You were Honoria once—now you find that you are
                  Miss Brand of Rivanna, and must be governed by your station—and, what right have I
                  to blame you? I am so wretched that I could not have the heart to inflict upon my
                  worst enemy the agony I feel; but I have no anger now. I shall go back to my poor
                  house yonder, and endeavor to forget you—try to remember you only to pray Heaven
                  to bless you; but now, before we part, I will say what has been my feeling for
                  months, for years. I love you, Honoria! I love you, neither as friend nor cousin,
                  but with man's love for woman! I <emph>love</emph> you!—Oh! that does not express
                  my thought! The very ground your feet pressed has been dear to me. Your glove,
                  your handkerchief, the simplest object you have touched, has been precious to me.
                  I have loved you!—loved you day and night—waking and in dreams—in my joy and my
                  sorrow—you were my only solace! You took the place of father, mother, sister, and
                  brother; I was a poor, lonely orphan, but your love was enough. You were my
                  all—the light of my poor life, the pride and joy of a heart that centred all in
                  you! I lived for you—I would have died for you! That is my last
                  word—farewell!"</p>
               <p>He held out his hand, but suddenly the girl tottered; her head fell languidly
                  toward one shoulder; and, had not Innis supported her, she would have fallen.
                  Overcome by the long and passionate conflict, the poor heart taxed beyond its
                  strength, Honoria had fainted.</p>
               <p>Innis looked around—no one was near, to render assistance. Within twenty paces, a
                  little stream, gushing from a rock, ran between grassy banks. Innis bore the girl
                  to the stream, and a handful of the cool water speedily revived her.</p>
               <p>As she opened her eyes, he withdrew his arm, but suddenly she clung to him.</p>
               <p>"Oh no, no! do not leave me!" she exclaimed. "Oh, do not go, Edmund! I
                  too—have—loved <emph>you</emph>—loved you dearly!"</p>
               <p>And, as though the avowal had exhausted her strength, Honoria's head sank on his
                  breast; she hid her blushing cheeks, and shook with a vague, delicious tremor in
                  her true-love's arms.</p>
               <p>When she looked up at him, the young face was full of tears and blushes, but a
                  smile shone there, like April sunshine.</p>
               <p>The wind laughed above them, in the mighty oak; the little stream ran gleefully
                  between its grassy margins; the birds sang for them; the white clouds floated—they
                  were young, they loved, and were triumphant over fate; for, whatever the hard
                  hours bring, two hearts that love are the victors.</p>

               <head>XVII. MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.</head>
               <p>THE two fond hearts thus beat together; each pressed to each—but, alas! it was
                  more than probable that a stern hand, that of no less a personage than the
                  resolute Colonel Brand, would thrust them asunder.</p>
               <p>Innis felt a chill invade his heart. What possibility could there be of gaining
                  the colonel's consent to his union with Honoria? She was his favorite daughter,
                  his darling and pride; she would inherit from him princely possessions; would he
                  ever permit her to unite her fortunes to those of the poor youth, when she might
                  command the homage of the proudest and wealthiest in the land?</p>
               <p>These questions came to the youthful heart, still trembling and agitated from the
                  sudden weight of happiness, and Innis had an additional source of foreboding.
                  Would not his course be attributed to the basest motives—nay, would not Colonel
                  Brand meet him on the very threshold of Rivanna, with an insult—with the charge
                  that he had dishonorably taken advantage of the freedom accorded him by the
                  family, to win the affection of the young and beautiful heiress? The face of the
                  youth blushed at the very idea of such an accusation. What would be the result?
                  Insult—quarrel—bitterness beyond words; and, as he pondered thus, he looked at
                  Honoria.</p>
               <p>There was no doubt in her face; naught but unshrinking, unhesitating love. Where
                  the youth trembled, she, the "weaker vessel," was firm; love had wrought this
                  mystery.</p>
               <p>"My poor darling," said Innis, looking at the girl with inexpressible pride and
                  tenderness, "I fear this day is the beginning of much suffering for you, but I
                  love you so dearly!"</p>
               <p>She inclined her head sidewise until it touched his shoulder. Then she looked up
                  into his eyes, and said, smiling:</p>
               <p>"You ought to know that <emph>that</emph> is enough to console me for all,
                  Edmund!"</p>
               <p>An hour afterward, Honoria had told her mother all. The good lady shook her head
                  sadly.</p>
               <p>"My poor, poor child," she said, drawing her daughter to her heart, "I feared
                  this, and yet had not resolution enough to interfere between this affection on
                  your part and Edmund's. He is all that the noblest woman could wish, and, were I
                  able to control your fate, I should not hesitate; but I am powerless. You know
                  your father's pride, and, I must add, worldliness. He has resolved, I fear, that
                  you shall make a grand match; and Edmund is so poor—this terrible poverty!"</p>
               <p>"It is nothing, mamma!" said Honoria, with a blush and a smile. Her mother smiled
                  in reply, but it was rather a sad smile.</p>
               <p>"It is every thing with Colonel Brand—or much, at least—but let us hope for the
                  best. You say that Edmund would not permit you to bind yourself. That is like him,
                  and time may change all. He may make his mark in the colony, and that may
                  reconcile your father to the arrangement. I think, now, that Edmund had better
                  absent himself for a short time."</p>
               <p>"Yes, indeed, mamma; I have already given him his orders," replied Honoria,
                  laughing.</p>
               <p>Do not laugh at her laughter, reader. She was a mere child, and so happy.</p>
               <p>Innis left Rivanna on the same evening, and the place seemed dark to Honoria. For
                  the first time, she felt how dearly, how absorbingly she loved him.</p>
               <p>Such had been the events of a single day in the life of Honoria Brand. She was
                  happy beyond words; her young life was flooded all at once with sunshine; and the
                  future seemed to contain no cloud which could overshadow her existence.</p>

               <head>XVIII. HOW THEY DREW LOTS WHICH SHOULD EAT THE DUMB-CAKE.</head>
               <p>THE Virginians have been noted always for their devotion to the pleasures of
                  social intercourse—their love of company, festivities, of whatever lifts from the
                  heart the inexorable weight of care, or dissipates the wearying preoccupation of
                  affairs. To enjoy while life lasts, and catch the perfume of the blossom—such is
                  the philosophy of this race of English people living under brighter skies and
                  warmer sunshine than the skies and sunshine of that "nest of swans," as
                  Shakespeare calls Old England. To laugh, to dance, to drive dull care away—such
                  has always been the habit of the country society of Virginia; and at Rivanna, in
                  the old times of which I write, the days and nights were one round of gayety. The
                  flying hours were sent upon their way with joyous laughter—with music, games,
                  rides to the mountain, and that most popular of all divertisements,
                  love-making.</p>
               <p>All day the merry revel went on, and when night came the great mansion blazed with
                  lights—the negro violinists tuned their instruments, the halls resounded, and the
                  little beauties and their cavaliers bowed low in the stately minuet, or flew
                  through the mazes of the Virginia reel, until the hands of the great
                  shadowy-looking clock behind the hall-door pointed to midnight.</p>
               <p>The evening came at last preceding the day upon which it was determined that the
                  party should break up. The company seemed to have grown weary of dancing, of
                  games, of jest and laughter. As a new entertainment, they had recourse to
                  "ghost-stories;" and, the lights having been put out, they grouped themselves upon
                  chairs, settees, cushions, and the floor, listening in awe-struck silence to the
                  low whisper of the story-teller of the moment.</p>
               <p>The spectacle was striking. Through the tall windows the pallid moonlight streamed
                  into the large apartment, projecting fantastic shadows on the carpet; the silken
                  dresses of the young girls shimmered in the weird light, and the darker costumes
                  of their male companions assumed a lugubrious and funereal appearance, the figures
                  but half defined in the gloom.</p>
               <p>At last the ghost-story, related in a low, awe-struck whisper, was over, and the
                  group drew a long breath. A second and a third narration followed—the mournful
                  splendor of the moonlight seemed to deepen—the shadow of the great oak without,
                  through whose leaves a wind swept, waved upon the floor, making all turn their
                  heads quickly—and when suddenly the great clock struck, with its clangorous,
                  metallic sound, in the darkness, something like a shiver ran through every
                  frame.</p>
               <p>The last story ended, and a deep silence followed. It was broken by Lou Brand,
                  who, essaying to laugh, but failing lamentably, said:</p>
               <p>"Well, girls, there is but one thing more for us to do, and that is, to <emph>eat
                     the dumb-cake</emph> to-night."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes!" came from the rest.</p>
               <p>"Who will venture?" continued the young lady. "It is said to be a fearful ordeal,
                  and mamma tells of a young lady, a friend of hers once, who saw a sight so
                  dreadful that she went distracted."</p>
               <p>Exclamations of terror and curiosity greeted these words.</p>
               <p>"What was it?"</p>
               <p>The young lady shook her head.</p>
               <p>"You may laugh at me," she replied, "for saying so, but these ghost-stories have
                  made me nervous. I tried to make a jest just now, and failed. I cannot tell you
                  mamma's story—I could not sleep after it. And I think, upon the whole,<pb

                     the dumb-cake</emph> to-night."</p>
               <p>But this proposition was received with murmurs.</p>
               <p>"No harm can result from it," said one.</p>
               <p>"I will venture," said another.</p>
               <p>"And I."</p>
               <p>"And I," said a third and fourth.</p>
               <p>"Well," said the young lady, "if you are resolved, I will not dissuade you. But,
                  as there are so many candidates, you must draw lots."</p>
               <p>This was readily agreed to, and, procuring a wheat-straw, the young lady divided
                  it into a number of pieces of equal length, with the exception of one, which was
                  very short, and grasped them in her hand, the protruding ends exactly
                  coinciding.</p>
               <p>"Form a circle on the floor, now," she said, "and I will stand in the centre, and
                  each can draw."</p>
               <p>About half a dozen of the young girls promptly obeyed, and the protestations of
                  her companions induced Honoria, very much against her will, to become one of the
                  group.</p>
               <p>"Each draw one straw, now," said Lou Brand; "the girl who draws the shortest will
                  be the one."</p>
               <p>The ceremony was performed in solemn silence. Each in turn drew.</p>
               <p>"Now hold up your hands."</p>
               <p>This was done.</p>
               <p>"<emph>You</emph> have drawn the short straw, Honoria," said Lou Brand to her
                  sister, "and <emph>you</emph> must go through the ordeal."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I cannot!" exclaimed Honoria.</p>
               <p>But this was protested against by all; and Honoria found herself doomed to
                     <emph>eat the dumb-cake.</emph>

               <head>XIX. TERROR.</head>
               <p>THE singular rite styled <emph>eating the dumb-cake</emph> was one of those
                  superstitious ceremonies which, whether derived from half-civilized and credulous
                  African nurses, or having their origin far back beyond memory, had taken fast hold
                  upon the imaginations of the young at this period.</p>
               <p>The origin of the name is difficult to determine, especially as no cake of any
                  description was eaten. Was the name metaphorical, and did it signify that those
                  who performed the ceremony saw sights which sealed their lips, rendering them
                     <emph>dumb</emph> as to the mystery?</p>
               <p>It is certain, at least, that there was something sombre and mysterious about the
                  rite—a knowledge of which was carefully concealed from all but the female sex; and
                  the preparations for it were weird and fantastic.</p>
               <p>First, the maiden selected to perform the ceremony was to leave all her companions
                  and await the hour of eleven at night. Then she was to take a bucket, proceed
                  silently and alone to the mystic spot where three streams met, fill the bucket,
                  and then gain with it the chamber selected for the mysterious ceremony. All was to
                  be performed without assistance. No other human being must be near. Having reached
                  her chamber, she was to deposit the bucket on the floor, doff her garments, and,
                  when ready to retire, dip the sleeve of the garment which she had worn nearest her
                  person in the water, and place it upon a chair.</p>
               <p>These ceremonies, it was supposed, would consume nearly an hour, and midnight
                  would be near when they were finished. The neophyte was then to stand perfectly
                  motionless and silent, awaiting the stroke of midnight. The strokes were to be
                  counted in silence from "one" to "twelve." At the stroke of twelve the maiden was
                  to look over her shoulder into a mirror placed for the purpose—and the result
                  would be, that she would see her future husband!</p>
               <p>It will now be understood why Honoria was reluctant to join the group, and had
                  exclaimed, "Oh, I cannot!" when the lot fell to her; and why, in both cases, she
                  permitted herself to be over-ruled. She wished and she did not wish to see her
                  "future husband"—for these two words conjured up the form of Edmund Innis.
                  Superstitious, like all at that epoch, she had a lurking belief in the mysterious
                  ceremony, and shrunk from attempting thus to read that future which must bring her
                  joy or misery in connection with Innis.</p>
               <p>She had yielded, however, ashamed of herself, it may be, or saying, "It is
                  nothing." When the whole party soon afterward retired to their respective
                  apartments, Honoria went to her own, where on this night no companion was to share
                  her couch, and resolutely prepared for the mysterious ordeal.</p>
               <p>An unexpected obstacle suddenly presented itself. The night, which had been
                  hitherto fair, had gradually become over-clouded; in the distance was heard the
                  low muttering of thunder; and from moment to moment sullen flashes of far
                  lightning divided the night.</p>
               <p>"If I go, I must go now, and I have promised," murmured the girl.</p>
               <p>It was not far that she must go to procure the mystic water. In a dell,
                  overshadowed by great trees, a few hundred years from the house, three small
                  rivulets, tributaries of the Rivanna, mingled their waters within a few feet of
                  each other; and toward this spot, holding in her hand the bucket, Honoria now
                  hastened.</p>
               <p>The night had become darker and darker, the heavens more and more obscured by the
                  huge masses of inky clouds, which were divided at every instant by vivid
                  lightnings. These dazzling serpents, appearing and vanishing as suddenly, were
                  followed by the hoarse rear of thunder; and, terrified by this uproar of the
                  elements, Honoria hastened on as rapidly as possible, to reach the desired point.
                  As she did so, terror gradually took possession of her. Her pulse beat feverishly,
                  and her quick breathing indicated that she was nearly overcome by fright.</p>
               <p>But her word was given, and her character for resolution at stake. She must go on,
                  and she did so—pale, terrified, stumbling, as she ran. The shadowy boughs above
                  her seemed to reach down spectral hands to grasp her and bear her away. The bushes
                  took the shape of something weird and fearful lying in wait for her. When,
                  suddenly, an owl uttered his ghostly laughter near, she shrunk, and nearly fainted
                  from terror.</p>
               <p>How she had strength to proceed she could never explain, but she resolutely went
                  on, reached the spot, filled the bucket, and hurried back toward the hall,
                  panting, tottering, dizzy, and stumbling as she ran from the fiery lightning,
                  whose red finger seemed to be feeling for her in the darkness.</p>
               <p>Her will supported her, nevertheless, and at last her foot struck the sill of the
                  side-door by which she intended to gain her chamber. Here her strength gave way,
                  and she sank down, nearly overcome by nervous agitation.</p>
               <p>A few moments, however, sufficed for the recovery of her strength, and, raising
                  the bucket once more, she mounted painfully with the heavy weight to her
                  chamber.</p>
               <p>There all was still, and nothing was heard but the low sound of the fire, which,
                  in anticipation of the coolness of the autumn night, had been kindled some hours
                  before in the great fireplace. The wood had been nearly all consumed—a few brands
                  only were left, which had fallen from the andirons, and around these the flames,
                  about to expire, were licking with their snake-like tongues.</p>
               <p>Without, the storm raged with violence, and the ghastly glare of the moon, seen
                  from time to time, as the ebon clouds drifted away before the wind, only made the
                  night more lugubrious.</p>
               <pb n="42" xml:id="VAC6141-00000023"/>
               <p>"Oh, I cannot, I cannot!" exclaimed the girl, looking around her with a shudder.
                  "I am not well, I am nervous—sick—"</p>
               <p>She went toward the fire, as though that were something cheerful and friendly;
                  and, seating herself in a great armchair, endeavored to regain her calmness.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>XX. THE DUMB-OAKE.</head>
               <p>IN spite of every effort made by Honoria, she found it impossible to recover her
                  calmness. It is probable that the prolonged loss of rest, incident upon the
                  festivities of the many preceding nights, had predisposed her to nervous
                  agitation; but, whatever may have been the cause, she was now laboring under very
                  great excitement, and shrunk, trembling, at every sound.</p>
               <p>The strange rite she was about to perform came to add the finishing touch to her
                  agitation.</p>
               <p>There was the bucket, filled with the mysterious water from the weird locality
                  where the three streams met; she looked sidewise at it, with a sudden quaking, as
                  though it were some frightful and repellent monster, some hideous thing. This was
                  to aid her in—in what? <emph>In seeing the figure of her future husband!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>At that thought, a quick blush came to the beautiful young face, driving away for
                  an instant the expression of terror. It was the name Edmund that rose to her lips,
                  and brought the crimson to her cheeks. <emph>Could</emph> any other person than
                  Edmund ever sustain toward her that most sacred relation? Was it within the bounds
                  of possibility that any one but Edmund could be <emph>her</emph> husband? At the
                  very thought, the pale checks flushed, and she exclaimed in a low tone, "I would
                  rather die!"</p>
               <p>Her own voice made her start, and she looked round fearfully. Every object seemed
                  to have assumed a new character, becoming threatening or lugubrious. The shadows
                  of the curtains on the wall resembled dark hands raised to strike her; the great
                  oak without was a spectre peering in through her casement; the half-hideous,
                  half-grotesque heads on the tops of the tall andirons seemed grinning at her
                  terror and mocking her.</p>
               <p>The nervous agitation of the young lady had now attained almost its highest point.
                  The storm roared with a fury more appalling than before. The shadows assumed more
                  threatening shapes. At every sound, Honoria started, shuddering and gazing around
                  her with affrighted eyes. This excitement grew at last so powerful that she
                  scarcely dared to move. With a trembling frame and colorless cheeks she listened
                  in an agony of terror, and once she wellnigh uttered a scream, for a low, painful
                  breathing seemed to issue from the great white bed, which, with spectral curtains
                  drawn together like a shroud, alternately appeared and vanished as the dying
                  firelight leaped aloft or disappeared.</p>
               <p>The low breathing had scarcely ceased, when another source of agitation presented
                  itself. Above the fireplace hung that portrait of the elder Lord Ruthven, Colonel
                  Brand's friend, and the picture had changed its quarter from the colonel's
                  dressing-room by a singular chance, which will be explained in the progress of the
                  narrative. As Honoria gazed now at the dark, melancholy face, it seemed alive. The
                  shadowy eyes were fixed upon her with terrifying intensity. She looked away, but
                  they seemed to draw her, and there again was the dark, lugubrious gaze, full of
                  mysterious meaning. Then the brows seemed to contract with a frown—the lips to
                  assume an ominous and threatening expression—the portrait to move, and the figure
                  to be about to step from the canvas<figure/>
                  <pb n="(Illustration) -43" xml:id="VAC6141-00000024"/> vas and extend its shadowy
                  hand toward her.</p>
               <p>Honoria rose to her feet, trembling and shuddering. Her terror had reached its
                  climax. She felt that it was necessary to dissipate the fearful atmosphere around
                  her, or she would fall fainting upon the floor. The thought of calling for
                  assistance occurred to her, but the storm was too violent to admit of her being
                  heard. Then she would become the laughing-stock of all—was she not overcome simply
                  by foolish nervousness? No, she would not shrink.</p>
               <p>"I am no longer a child," she murmured; "I must prove myself a woman, for
                     <emph>his sake</emph> if not for my own!"</p>
               <p>She knelt and prayed, trembling, but firm in will.</p>
               <p>Then partly disrobing herself, the young lady dipped the sleeve of the snowy
                  garment, worn next her person, in the bucket, placed it with a tremulous hand upon
                  a chair, and went toward the mirror.</p>
               <p>At the same moment the great clock in the hall below began to strike midnight.</p>
               <p>Pale, trembling, with bare feet, hair falling upon her shoulders, and resembling
                  rather a ghost than a human being, the young lady counted the strokes one after
                  another, shuddering more and more as the number increased, and approached the
                  terrible "twelve," denoting midnight.</p>
               <p>Had she not been so completely mastered by terror, she might have seen two burning
                  eyes watching her from behind the shroud like curtains of the great bed.</p>
               <p>But she saw nothing; her eyes were half closed, and fixed upon the floor; one hand
                  was placed upon her heart, to still its terrible throbbing.</p>
               <p>Suddenly the clock struck twelve: a fearful shudder convulsed the frame of
                  Honoria; and turning quickly, she looked into the mirror.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>XXI. AT THREE IN THE MORNING.</head>
               <p>THE occurrences of this terrible night afterward became the topic of conversation
                  far and wide in the region around Rivanna; and the point of most interest seemed
                  to be the exact hour of the night at which the singular event—if there were
                  such—took place.</p>
               <p>It was remembered that the party in the drawing-room separated at about eleven—the
                  object having been to afford Honoria time to make her preparations, procure the
                  water from the stream, and be in readiness at midnight for the ordeal of the
                  dumb-cake. That she did make every preparation, and, in spite of the storm, reach
                  the point where the three streams met, and return with the bucket of water, was
                  soon ascertained—the bucket was there, and one of the maids had seen her pass
                  through the grounds. She had regained the house, it was ascertained, some time
                  before midnight; and certainly had time to arrange her night toilet, to perform
                  the ceremony of dipping the sleeve of her garment in the water, and was ready to
                  look into the mirror at the moment when the great clock in the hall below struck
                  twelve.</p>
               <p>And yet the horrible incidents of the night must have taken place a considerable
                  time <emph>after</emph> midnight—perhaps as late as one in the morning. There was
                  no means, it is true, of accurately ascertaining this fact—that is to say, of
                  fixing the precise hour; but the young ladies of the party were confident that
                  they had listened for sounds from Honoria's room <emph>at midnight;</emph> were
                  equally certain that they had <emph>heard nothing;</emph> and they had asserted
                  that it was a considerable time <emph>after</emph> midnight, and just as they were
                  retiring, when the piercing shriek which startled them was heard issuing from
                  Honoria's apartment!</p>
               <p>The shriek was followed by a heavy fall. The whole party of young ladies,<pb
                     n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6141-00000025"/> clad in their white night-dresses, ran,
                  in undisguised alarm, to the chamber, and there a piteous sight met their eyes.
                  Honoria was stretched upon the floor insensible, and, when they raised her, her
                  companions gave a quick shudder; she hung upon their arms so inert and lifeless,
                  that they thought her dead. Restoratives were quickly applied, and water dashed in
                  the young girl's face, to arouse her; but, for a long time, these remedies had no
                  effect. Meanwhile, Lady Brand had been sent for, and hurried to the chamber. As
                  she ran to her child, calling to her in agonized tones, a faint color came to
                  Honoria's checks; she opened her eyes, gazed vacantly around her, and then,
                  clutching rather than simply embracing her mother, cried in a trembling and broken
                  voice:</p>
               <p>"O mother!—protect me! do not leave me! protect me from that horror—on my
                  shoulder!"</p>
               <p>As she spoke, she closed her eyes, and with a frightful shudder clung to her
                  mother, as though for protection.</p>
               <p>She was borne to bed immediately, and Lady Brand requested the young ladies to
                  retire, and leave her to tend her daughter. This they did with reluctance; but the
                  apartment was soon vacated by all but Honoria, Lady Brand, and her eldest
                  daughter.</p>
               <p>"Honoria has had some terrible shock—Heaven knows what!" said Lady Brand,
                  supporting the trembling form of the half-inanimate girl in her arms on the bed.
                  "What it was can be ascertained afterward; what is necessary now is a
                  physician."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, yes, mamma!" exclaimed her daughter, pale, and in tears.</p>
               <p>"Do not disturb Colonel Brand; he will be of no service. Send Cato—he is trusty—on
                  the best horse in the stables, for Dr. Bond."</p>
               <p>The young lady hurried to arouse Cato, who was soon in the saddle.</p>
               <p>An hour afterward, Dr. Bond arrived—an elderly, solemn-looking gentleman, who
                  "hummed" between his phrases, looked profound, and rounded his periods with
                  sonorous scientific terms. He prescribed some trifle for Honoria, assuring Lady
                  Brand that the young girl was "simply laboring under a slight nervous disorder,
                  partaking of the character of, but not to be accurately designated, at least at
                  the present moment, as hysteria; something had doubtless disagreed with her, and
                  subsequent agitation on some subject, or, in fact, on no subject, would amply
                  account for a slight attack which need occasion no alarm—no alarm whatever, I
                  assure you, my dear madam."</p>
               <p>On the afternoon of the next day, Honoria, who had passed the forenoon in a
                  condition of half-consciousness only, began to grow animated, and had a
                  magnificent color.</p>
               <p>"Look, doctor," said Lady Brand to Dr. Bond. "I think my daughter's appearance
                  indicates an access of fever."</p>
               <p>"Hum!" said Dr. Bond, clearing his throat with extreme dignity, "it may be that
                  there is a <emph>slight</emph>—hum—inclination to—as you say, madam—fever."</p>
               <p>And, with a profound air, the doctor felt the young girl's pulse.</p>
               <p>"I <emph>know</emph> it is fever," said Lady Brand, brusquely, and turning to
                  Colonel Brand, who was seated, still and solemn, in the chamber, she exchanged a
                  few words with him in a low tone, after which she left the apartment.</p>
               <p>Descending the staircase rapidly, Lady Brand was just passing through the hall,
                  when suddenly she found herself face to face with a pale young man, whose white
                  lips said:</p>
               <p>"What is the matter with Honoria, aunt?"</p>
               <p>Lady Brand seized his hand, and exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"I will tell you, when you return, Edmund. I intended to send Cato,
                     but<emph>you</emph> will not return without him, if you have to drag him."</p>
               <p>"Drag him! drag whom?"</p>
               <p>"Dr. Vandyke."</p>
               <p>Innis gazed with started eyes at Lady Brand.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Dr. Vandyke!" she repeated; "he must come at once, and see my child; this
                  stupid Dr. Bond will let her die—"</p>
               <p>"Die!—good Heavens! of what?"</p>
               <p>"Of brain-fever."</p>
               <p>As she was speaking, Lady Brand had hastened toward a desk in a corner of the
                  hall, which contained pen, ink, and paper. Taking a sheet, she wrote upon it:</p>
               <p>"You said once that if I ever needed you, you would come, travelling night and
                  day, if necessary. I need you now."</p>
               <p>Signing and directing this note, she gave it to Innis.</p>
               <p>"Bring the doctor back with you, my son, and as soon as possible," she said; "I
                  have an instinct in diseases, and this of Honoria's is going to be critical."</p>
               <p>Innis scarcely waited to hear the sentence finished. His through-bred, fresh and
                  in fine condition, stood at the door; he was in the saddle in a minute, and
                  disappeared at full gallop in the direction of Williamsburg.</p>
               <p>It seemed to Lady Brand a century since the departure of Innis, and she counted
                  the hours, day and night, with feverish impatience—holding the hot face of Honoria
                  in her bosom—giving her cooling draughts—striving to combat the disease until the
                  arrival of the person for whom she had sent.</p>
               <p>Dr. Bond had taken up his residence at the hall, and still rounded his periods
                  with serene dignity, drank the colonel's wine, and declared the case of Miss Brand
                  one which would readily yield to treatment, unless another and more threatening
                  phase was superinduced upon the present, which his diagnosis told him was—</p>
               <p>The voice droned on, and Lady Brand did not even seem to hear it. It was three in
                  the morning, and she held the hot hand of the girl, listening.</p>
               <p>All at once she turned her head quickly.</p>
               <p>"He has come!" she said.</p>
               <p>"To whom, madam, may I ask, do you—hum—refer?" said Dr. Bond.</p>
               <p>Lady Brand was already at the door, a lamp in her hand; steps traversed the hall,
                  and then mounted.</p>
               <p>"Well," said a vibrating and metallic voice, "how is she?"</p>
               <p>And Dr. Vandyke came and grasped the hand of Lady Brand; his long, gray hair
                  streaming around his face, in which burned two piercing eyes; his long overcoat
                  covered with dust; his pipe-stem legs, lost in huge riding-boots, clattering as he
                  walked.</p>
               <p>"How is Honoria?"</p>
               <p>"She is ill."</p>
               <p>"Worse?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>This dialogue terminated with a nod from Dr. Vandyke, who went into the chamber,
                  and up to the bed.</p>
               <p>Dr. Bond was standing there in an attitude of much dignity. An expression of some
                  surprise, and even <foreign xml:lang="FRA">hauteur,</foreign> mingled with the
                  dignity.</p>
               <p>"Hum," he said, "I have the honor of seeing Dr.—"</p>
               <p>"Vandyke, at your service. How is Miss Brand?"</p>
               <p>This question was delivered with business-like brevity, and the tone of it
                  contrasted strongly with that of Dr. Bond.</p>
               <p>The latter cleared his throat, and commenced an imposing sentence; but Dr.
                  Vandyke, measuring his professional brother at one glance, proceeded
                  unceremoniously to form his own opinion of the sufferer's condition.</p>
               <p>Lady Brand was at his side. After some moment's silence:</p>
               <p>"Well, doctor?" she said, anxiously.</p>
               <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6141-00000026"/>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke said, briefly:</p>
               <p>"Well, madam?"</p>
               <p>That was all; he did not look at the lady.</p>
               <p>"What do you think of Honoria?"</p>
               <p>"She has brain-fever."</p>
               <p>"The attack is dangerous?"</p>
               <p>"Hum—will you permit me, madam—if I might venture to express an opinion," said Dr.
                  Bond, with some <foreign xml:lang="FRA">hauteur,</foreign> "Miss Brand has already
                  improved under my treatment, and I do not regard her case as critical in its
                  character."</p>
               <p>Lady Brand bowed hurriedly, but looked at Dr. Vandyke. This look was
                  unmistakable.</p>
               <p>"You desire my opinion of Miss Brand's condition, madam?" he said.</p>
               <p>"Yes, doctor."</p>
               <p>He looked at her with a singular, wistful glance, and muttered:</p>
               <p>"You were always strong; superior in brain and nerve to any woman I ever
                  knew—"</p>
               <p>"Doctor!"</p>
               <p>Lady Brand had begun to tremble from head to foot.</p>
               <p>"Speak, and speak plainly!" she said.</p>
               <p>"It is best. There is no more for me to learn of this case. The crisis will take
                  place in three days. Honoria will then be convalescent, or—do you think you can
                  stand the truth?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—yes! Speak."</p>
               <p>"She will be dead!"</p>
               <p>A low groan from the door-way came like an echo to the words.</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke looked round—his steady gaze passing from the white face of Lady Brand
                  to the face of him who had uttered the groan.</p>
               <p>It was Innis who, leaning upon the frame of the door, and gazing with eyes wet
                  with tears upon the sick girl, had summed up as it were in this expression of
                  anguish the despair under which it seemed to him his heart would break.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>XXII. THE CRISIS.</head>
               <p>THREE days nearly, hour for hour, passed. During this time, Dr. Vandyke scarcely
                  left for an instant the bedside of Honoria, scarcely tasted food, and concentrated
                  every faculty of his powerful brain upon the wellnigh hopeless task of snatching
                  the sick girl from the hand of Death stretched forth to clutch her. There was
                  something sublime in this gigantic struggle of the eccentric dwarf, in his
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">outré</foreign> costume, with the supreme enemy of
                  humanity. The conflict was breast to breast; science and the spirit of death
                  wrestled over the wasted body; and at last the decisive moment came.</p>
               <p>It was an hour or two past midnight. The three days fixed by Dr. Vandyke, as the
                  term of the struggle when the crisis would arrive, were about to expire.</p>
               <p>Honoria, wasted away to a phantom nearly, lay, or rather tossed to and fro, burnt
                  up by the fearful fever which was preying upon all the sources of her life.</p>
               <p>In the group near the fireplace stood Colonel Brand, still, and overawed by the
                  terrible spectacle; Lady Brand, pale, but with red rings around her eyes; her
                  elder daughter, faint and sobbing; and Dr. Bond, who had lingered with
                  unprofessional persistence, preserving still his air of offended dignity, but
                  sullenly bending before the imperious will of Dr. Vandyke, who, standing at the
                  head of the bed, watched the girl with an intensity which indicated the profound
                  anxiety concealed beneath his collected expression.</p>
               <p>All felt that this man, in the long overcoat, with the elfin gray locks, was the
                  master, and left all to him. The only sound which disturbed the silence from
                  moment to moment was the brief, vibrating voice, demanding "Ice!" "More ice!" The
                  burning temples seeming to melt it as soon as it was applied. The sick girl, with
                  head thrown back, eyes closed or wandering, lips full of physical agony, and
                  cruelly wasted already in face and form, was wrestling with the enemy of
                  Life—Death, the pitiless, the inexorable.</p>
               <p>All at once the mutterings of agony gave place to words:</p>
               <p>"The breathing! the breathing! there in the bed!" exclaimed Honoria.</p>
               <p>As she uttered the words, she threw herself violently to the opposite side of the
                  bed, and said in a scream almost:</p>
               <p>"The dagger!—the weight upon my shoulders!—that horror!—"</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke went quickly to Lady Brand, and uttered a few words.</p>
               <p>His communication must have been a request that all but the girl's mother and
                  himself should leave the apartment, as Lady Brand spoke in a low tone to her
                  husband, and all but herself and the physician went out of the chamber.</p>
               <p>"There is something terrible under all this," said Dr. Vandyke, in a low tone, to
                  the lady; "the case is mental—physical remedies are of little avail."</p>
               <p>"O doctor, can nothing be done?"</p>
               <p>"Something—physical æsthesia is practicable; but—"</p>
               <p>"Help! help!" cried the girl, raising her hands as though to repulse some fearful
                  object.</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke pressed the bandage containing ice to her forehead, and with the other
                  hand forced her to receive between her lips some drops of an anodyne.</p>
               <p>"In ten minutes all will be decided," he muttered.</p>
               <p>As he spoke, the girl fell back uttering a low moan, and then lay motionless. Her
                  labored breathing only indicated life.</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke stood holding her pulse, and watching her with the eyes of a hawk.
                  Some minutes passed thus; then the fiery flush on the patient's face faded almost
                  imperceptibly into a less crimson tint, the least observable moisture appeared
                  upon the forehead at the roots of the hair; and through the iron frame of the
                  physician a tremor passed.</p>
               <p>"The pulse is moderating!" he said, in a low voice; "wait!"</p>
               <p>And drawing from its fob a large watch he counted, fixing his eyes upon the
                  dial.</p>
               <p>A minute passed in dead silence.</p>
               <p>"Ninety!" rang out sonorous, from the lips of the physician; and, turning to Lady
                  Brand, he added:</p>
               <p>"Your daughter is saved!"</p>
               <p>An hour afterward there was no longer the least doubt of the patient's condition.
                  She was sleeping almost sweetly—her brow bathed in perspiration, which Lady Brand,
                  scarce able to suppress her sobs of joy, from time to time wiped away with a
                  handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke was down-stairs eating voraciously, and oblivious apparently of the
                  stately colonel and the dignified Dr. Bond, who were seated at the same table,
                  drinking wine.</p>
               <p>"May I—ahem—have the pleasure, sir—"</p>
               <p>And Dr. Bond, from whose oracular lips issued these words, filled his glass, and
                  pushed the bottle to Dr. Vandyke.</p>
               <p>"I never drink wine," came in a species of snap from that personage.</p>
               <p>Dr. Bond drew back with <foreign xml:lang="FRA">hauteur.</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>"Unfits a physician for his business," said Dr. Vandyke, "and I don't want it.
                  When I am hungry I cat."</p>
               <p>"Obviously, sir," was the remotely satirical reply of Dr. Bond.</p>
               <p>"Rode all day and all night to arrive," said Dr. Vandyke, with his mouth full.</p>
               <p>"And—ahem—you think that Miss Brand—"</p>
               <p>"I never think!"</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke uttered the words with extreme curtness, and went on eating.</p>
               <p>"At least, sir," responded Dr. Bond, with lofty politeness, "you have formed<pb
                     n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6141-00000027"/> some theory—ahem—of Miss Brand's
                  case?"</p>
               <p>"Theory?"</p>
               <p>"Theory I said, sir."</p>
               <p>"No, I have formed no theory. I can see with my eyes. Miss Brand has
                  brain-fever."</p>
               <p>"I was also aware of that fact, sir," said Dr. Bond, with immense politeness;
                  "brain-fever, attributable to loss of rest, dissipation, and exposure."</p>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>"Do I—ahem—understand you, sir, to say—"</p>
               <p>"I don't know what you understand. Miss Brand has brain-fever produced by other
                  causes."</p>
               <p>"What causes?"</p>
               <p>"I decline to discuss the subject."</p>
               <p>Dr. Bond rose with dignity.</p>
               <p>"If I am to be insulted in this house, Colonel Brand, I will no longer intrude. It
                  seems that I am not only not to be consulted, but my natural inquiries—questions
                  obviously drawn forth by the case, sir—are to be treated with indignity!"</p>
               <p>"I never answer questions, and I understand this case," said Dr. Vandyke, pushing
                  back his plate. "I am sent for by Lady Brand, and I treat the case."</p>
               <p>A servant came at this moment to summon Dr. Vandyke to the sick-room, and he went
                  thither at once, leaving Dr. Bond in such extreme wrath that he soon afterward
                  left Rivanna in disgust.</p>
               <p>Honoria was still sleeping, and the healthful moisture still bathed her brow.</p>
               <p>"I am so anxious, doctor," said the poor mother, in a whisper, "that I wish you to
                  remain with me. I disturbed you in—"</p>
               <p>"No, I had finished; was undergoing a stupid interrogation from my brother Bond,
                  who is an ass."</p>
               <p>He felt the pulse of the girl, and said:</p>
               <p>"All is going on well, and the force of the fever is spent. In three days the body
                  will begin to resume its normal functions; the mind remains."</p>
               <p>"The mind, doctor?"</p>
               <p>"The mind; that will be the real struggle. Listen to me a moment."</p>
               <p>And the physician drew Lady Brand toward the window.</p>
               <p>"I am perfectly familiar with this type," he said; "it is simple—the patient gets
                  well or dies quickly—all that is touch-and-go. What follows it is more terrible. I
                  will not bewilder you with scientific terms. In brief words, Honoria's attack will
                  be followed by permanent melancholy, hysteria, and worse, unless a peculiar course
                  is pursued in her case. I will write to-day, delegating my business in the capital
                  to an associate, and remain here—"</p>
               <p>"Oh, thanks—thanks!"</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke looked at Lady Brand with a peculiar expression. When he spoke his
                  voice was no longer cold and vibrating.</p>
               <p>"I want no thanks," he said. "People call me eccentric. Well, one of my
                  eccentricities is to regard the daughter of the woman I once loved as my own. You
                  were my only—well, what people call their romance! I should have been happy had
                  you married me, and you less happy—but enough of this. Let me finish. In five days
                  from this time Honoria will have recovered in a great degree from her fever, and
                  then we must combat the mental malady which will surely supervene. I will instruct
                  you when and how to make your inquiries. This will be of importance. That very
                  dignified dunderhead down-stairs thinks the attack produced by loss of rest, which
                  is pure nonsense. It is the result of terror—of a <emph>breathing</emph> heard in
                  that bed on the night of her seizure—of something which sprung or fell <emph>upon
                     her shoulders</emph>—of, I know not what, and yet I will know!"</p>
               <p>"Is it possible, doctor!"</p>
               <p>"Of that and that alone. Let us, for the present, however, combat the physical
                  malady—the mental must wait."</p>
               <p>The doctor went and sat down, as he spoke, in the great, high-backed arm-chair,
                  upon which Honoria had placed the garment dipped in the mystic water. As he did
                  so, he glanced quickly toward the mirror beyond, as though impressed by some
                  sudden idea connected with the relative positions of the two objects. His present
                  aim, however, seemed to be to snatch a little sleep.</p>
               <p>"I have not closed my eyes for forty-eight hours, and am a little fatigued," he
                  said. "This is an excellent bed—if you will permit, madam—I never snore!"</p>
               <p>And, closing his eyes, the doctor fell asleep almost instantly—his fantastic legs,
                  ending in huge feet and buckled shoes, stretched out straight before him; his arms
                  folded across his broad chest, and his face nearly concealed by the long, gray
                  locks of his hair.</p>

               <head>XXIII. DR. VANDYKE AND LADY BRAND.</head>
               <p>TEN days after the scenes just described, Lady Brand and Dr. Vandyke were seated
                  alone in the library at a late hour of the night, engaged in earnest
                  conversation.</p>
               <p>Colonel Brand had retired some time before, and no sound was heard throughout the
                  great mansion, save the ticking of the tall clock in its corner in the hall, and
                  the sighing of the autumn wind in the trees without.</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke was half-buried in a large arm-chair, whose yielding cushions made him
                  resemble more than ever a cutoff giant; and his pipe-stem legs were supported on a
                  velvet footstool, in the full light of the wax-candles in silver candelabra—the
                  light, soft but clear, bringing out in grand relief the enormous feet in their
                  huge buckled shoes. The gray hair was pushed back for once from his forehead; his
                  eyes were animated; he seemed to concentrate all the faculties of his mind upon
                  the communication being made to him by Lady Brand, who, seated opposite him, spoke
                  in a rapid and somewhat agitated voice, rising erect occasionally in her seat, and
                  then leaning back again.</p>
               <p>"I have obeyed your instructions," she said. "This evening Honoria was so composed
                  that I ventured to question her upon the occurrences of that unfortunate
                  night."</p>
               <p>"Ah!" came in a low voice from Dr. Vandyke.</p>
               <p>"I was most anxious to do so," continued Lady Brand, "for what you predicted has
                  duly come to pass. My child is nearly well of her mere physical disease, but the
                  terrible melancholy and nervous prostration, which you foretold, have come to
                  torture me and fill me with foreboding. She starts at the least noise; never
                  smiles, or seems at rest even; there is a constant tendency to shudder observable
                  in her; and once or twice at the least trifle—the movement of a shadow—my suddenly
                  rising from my chair—she has half screamed."</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke said, quickly:</p>
               <p>"A shadow?—rising from your chair?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, the shadow of any object thrown upon the curtains or wall by the
                  firelight—the lights are often put out, to avoid the glare."</p>
               <p>"Ah! shadows, then, affright her. Hum!—well. And rising from your chair? What
                  chair?"</p>
               <p>"The large one, in which I sit when not at the bedside."</p>
               <p>"The invalid-chair, with a high back?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"It remains in its former position?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; 'tis really too heavy to be moved easily, and stands, you know, facing the
                  fire, with the back to the bureau."</p>
               <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6141-00000028"/>
               <p>"Upon which is the mirror, is it not?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, doctor; but pray what importance can attach to—"</p>
               <p>"I will return to that point. Shadows!—rising from the chair!—hum!—Will you be
                  good enough to continue, madam? You this evening questioned Honoria: tell me in
                  detail what you have discovered."</p>
               <p>"I shall be able to do so in a few words. The subject seemed to agitate her
                  fearfully, and nothing but your express injunction could have induced me to press
                  my questions."</p>
               <p>"Right; but my injunctions were necessary. The mental disease has supervened. The
                  physical has yielded to treatment; the mental must be treated, too, unless you
                  wish a corpse in your house. What does the child say?"</p>
               <p>"I will tell you succinctly the result of the conversation; that is, all that I
                  discovered. You know what preceded the attack, and caused it. The young ladies on
                  a visit to us determined to perform the superstitious ceremony of eating the
                  dumb-cake, as it is called—of looking into a mirror to see their future
                  husbands—all absurd, but an old pastime—and Honoria was chosen to undergo the
                  ordeal. She acquiesced with great reluctance, but was persuaded to comply, and
                  courageously went through the ceremony of going in person for a bucket of water to
                  the spot where three streams met, and bearing it to her chamber. It is probable
                  that this agitated her, as the night was dark, and a fearful storm was in
                  progress. She went, however, to the point, a few hundred yards from the house,
                  returned hastily, and, at nearly midnight, gained her chamber."</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke listened with absorbed attention.</p>
               <p>"Well," he said, briefly.</p>
               <p>"Having reached her apartment, Honoria proceeded to perform the other ceremonies
                  dictated by this absurd superstition, of removing the under-garment next to her
                  body, and dipping one of its sleeves into the bucket."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Dr. Vandyke.</p>
               <p>"During the performance of all this—I mean during the process of undressing, and
                  preparing to retire—Honoria declares that her agitation was very great. It is
                  probable that loss of rest, arising from the late hours kept during the visit of
                  her young guests, may have predisposed her nerves to be thus affected; but it is
                  possible that the storm had been chiefly instrumental in exciting her. Whatever
                  the cause may have been, it is plain, from her statement, that her agitation was
                  excessive, and that every object around her assumed a threatening and terrifying
                  character. The curtains of the bed took the shape, she declares, of a shroud; the
                  shadows were terrifying, and a low breathing issued from the bed, behind which
                  something, she knew not what, seemed to be moving."</p>
               <p>"'<emph>Something,</emph>' you say—'something' is vague," said Dr. Vandyke; "did
                  Honoria describe in any manner this something?"</p>
               <p>"She could not. I laughed, of course—told her 'twas nothing—had she seen any
                  thing?—to which her agitated response was, that she had seen nothing at all, but
                  saw the curtains move, and heard the breathing."</p>
               <p>"The breathing? Ah! the breathing!" said Dr. Vandyke, in a low voice; "this is so
                  persistently alluded to, first in delirium, now in a lucid condition of mind—well,
                  decidedly, I begin to think—but continue, madam. Honoria heard this low breathing
                  from the bed whose curtains were shroud-like—started at the shadows—aught
                  more?"</p>
               <p>"But one circumstance, preceding the real terror of the night, which occurred an
                  hour later."</p>
               <p>"That is to say, at about one in the morning?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"And this circumstance, coming at twelve, to add its effect to the breathing and
                  the shadows?"</p>
               <p>"It was more singular than agitating. I should have enumerated, among the causes
                  of Honoria's agitation, the strange idea that a portrait hanging over the
                  fireplace followed her with its eyes, enjoyed her terror, and, at last, stretched
                  out its hand to seize her."</p>
               <p>"The poor child must indeed have labored under nervous excitement. What portrait
                  was it? I did not note it."</p>
               <p>"That of Lord Ruthven—father, I believe, of the young nobleman now in
                  Williamsburg."</p>
               <p>"Ah! How does it chance that this portrait is here?"</p>
               <p>"Lord Ruthven the elder was a friend of Colonel Brand's, and presented him, after
                  the European fashion, with his picture."</p>
               <p>"Well; but 'twas singular that it should adorn your daughter's chamber, was it
                  not?"</p>
               <p>"That is not the least strange incident. Another portrait hung there until within
                  a day or two of the time of this unhappy incident—a portrait of my grandfather,
                  the elder Colonel Seaton. By some means the cord attaching the picture to the hook
                  in the wall broke, from age and moths, perchance: the picture fell—the fall broke
                  the frame to pieces, and thus the portrait could not conveniently be rehung in its
                  former position."</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke nodded.</p>
               <p>"So you replaced it with another?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, the space on the wall covered by the picture was clearly defined from the
                  rest of the wall, and unsightly. I therefore removed from Colonel Brand's
                  dressing-room the portrait of Lord Ruthven, and hung it in the place of the
                  former."</p>
               <p>"Well; and this picture was one of the sources of Honoria's terror?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, it seemed to follow her with its eyes, and attempt to seize her; and, added
                  to her other causes of agitation, this nearly unstrung her nerves."</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"She rose to her feet, from the chair on which she sat, and, kneeling before
                  which, she had performed her devotions."</p>
               <p>"The great chair?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Continue, madam."</p>
               <p>"And then it was that, having performed the ceremony of dipping the sleeve of her
                  under-garment in the bucket, she turned to the mirror, just as the clock struck
                  midnight, to see her future husband."</p>
               <p>"Ah!—and she saw—?"</p>
               <p>"The portrait of Lord Ruthven."</p>
               <p>"The portrait!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, doctor. It hung above the fireplace; and the mirror, you know, stands
                  against the opposite wall, the bed being on the right as you go toward it, and the
                  large double window on the left."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes!"</p>
               <p>"Thus, in looking into the mirror, Honoria saw the reflection of the portrait
                  behind her."</p>
               <p>"Simple and absurd! So the dead Lord Ruthven was to be her future husband, since
                  'twas him she saw in the magic mirror?"</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke uttered a grunt.</p>
               <p>"We will talk of this at another time," he said. "It is unimportant now. This did
                  not cause Honoria to shriek and faint?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no! It simply made her more nervous, but the reflection of the object in the
                  mirror was obviously so natural that it impressed her instantly."</p>
               <p>"Her next proceeding?"</p>
               <p>"She retired quickly to the great bed, from which the breathing was no longer
                  heard; and it was about an hour afterward, when she had been asleep for a brief
                  space of time, that the horror of the night came."</p>
               <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6141-00000029"/>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke made a slight movement with his head, and said:</p>
               <p>"We come now to the point of most importance in the case. What was this horror?
                  Relate, as minutely as possible, what occurred."</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>XXIV. THE HORROR.</head>
               <p>LADY BRAND paused for some moments, and seemed to labor under very great
                  agitation.</p>
               <p>"My poor child!" she said, at length. "Doctor, you can scarcely conceive how
                  dangerously excited she grew while relating the last and most terrible events of
                  this horrible night. She became as white as a corpse, her voice was almost hollow
                  in its accent; and, O doctor, doctor! there was something in the expression of her
                  eyes which I did not like—I feared—"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and justly. Your daughter has narrowly escaped death from brain-fever: what
                  I aim at now is to prevent what is worse than death—insanity."</p>
               <p>Lady Brand sobbed for some moments, but recovered her self-command at length, and
                  said, firmly:</p>
               <p>"I shall give you the exact substance of Honoria's statement, doctor—a statement
                  made in broken words, as I held her in my arms. She shook with nervous excitement;
                  but there is something in being near a mother's heart which calms a child, I
                  think, and gives assurance of safety. Honoria seemed to feel this, and, spite of
                  her frightful agitation, went through with her narrative up to the moment when she
                  fainted and fell."</p>
               <p>"In front of the mirror?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, doctor."</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke knit his brows, and seemed to be concentrating all the faculties of
                  his mind upon one single idea.</p>
               <p>"Allow me to ask you one or two questions before you proceed," he said.</p>
               <p>The lady inclined her head and listened.</p>
               <p>"Has any change been made in the position of the furniture?"</p>
               <p>"In Honoria's chamber, you mean?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"None at all. Everything remains in the same position which it formerly
                  occupied."</p>
               <p>"Good! that simplifies matters. Now, madam, let us see. Entering the chamber by
                  the single door—for there is but one door, I believe?"</p>
               <p>"But one," said Lady Brand, indicating, by the expression of her countenance, the
                  surprise which she felt at this apparently irrelevant question. The doctor
                  perceived this expression, and said:</p>
               <p>"I will indicate later the object of these interrogatories. In entering your
                  daughter's apartment you have, immediately upon your right, the fireplace; in
                  front of it the large arm-chair, facing the fire; against the opposite wall the
                  toilet-table and mirror; on the left of the mirror a double window; on the right
                  the great bed. Is that all, madam?"</p>
               <p>"With the exception of the ordinary number of chairs, stools, the carpet, and an
                  old linen-chest."</p>
               <p>"A chest? In what part of the room is this chest?"</p>
               <p>"In the corner beyond the fireplace. But it is not used now; the key has been
                  lost, and the chest has not been opened, I think, for twenty years."</p>
               <p>"Hum! I care nothing, however, for the chest; and I have in my mind now a picture
                  of the theatre of this strange drama. A fireplace, with a portrait above it—a
                  great chair in front—a mirror against the opposite wall—a window, a bed, and in
                  this bed Honoria asleep at half an hour or an hour past midnight. What then
                  occurred, madam?—something frightful, I fear, and any scientific propensity to
                  sneer or jest dies in me at the thought of Honoria. This child has seen, or
                  believes she has seen, something terrible—some object such as the grave gives up
                  when the cerements of the dead are torn away—speak, now, and tell me what this
                  horror was!"</p>
               <p>"I shall proceed to do so," said Lady Brand, in a low and nervous voice. "I have
                  scarce recovered from the shock of the narrative, and recall every
                  particular."</p>
               <p>"Good," said Dr. Vandyke, fixing his penetrating eyes on the face of the lady; "it
                  is precisely these particular details which I wish to ascertain. I know that
                  Honoria saw something—was assailed by something, or that she fancied as much—and
                  that she shrieked and fainted. What I wish now to know is the hour of the night,
                  the position she occupied at the moment—all—and especially what seems trifling and
                  unimportant."</p>
               <p>"You shall know all, doctor, and in as brief terms as possible. Honoria declares
                  that she retired at a few minutes past midnight, and day awake for some time, the
                  victim of nervous agitation. The <emph>breathing</emph> which had so much alarmed
                  her was no longer heard, and the portrait was thrown into shadow now; but it was
                  some time before she could compose herself sufficiently to sleep. Finally,
                  however, exhaustion brought on slumber, or rather a species of half-consciousness,
                  and she either saw or dreamed that she saw a gigantic and shadowy arm—in the hand
                  a dagger—and this arm rose and fell three times, striking the weapon into the
                  white garment which Honoria had placed upon the chair."</p>
               <p>"Well," said Dr. Vandyke, coolly, "what next?"</p>
               <p>"The occurrence was so real—or the vision so vivid—that Honoria declares she must
                  have fainted. When she opened her eyes—in a few minutes, as she supposes—the
                  apartment was darker than before, and the storm which had raged up to this time
                  was dying away. All was still, except the far in utter of thunder and the low
                  hissing of the expiring fire. It must then have been nearly one in the morning,
                  and Honoria felt a new access of terror at the thought that she alone, in all
                  probability, was awake in the house. By degrees, however, this terror moderated;
                  she began to reason with herself upon the occurrences of the night. Might that all
                  have been the result of her fancy—the product of a diseased imagination starting
                  at the simplest noises? The breathing might have been the sighing of the wind in
                  the great oak without—the arm striking at the garment a mere effect of light and
                  shadow—the strange expression of the portrait undoubtedly a fantasy. Honoria,
                  doctor, is of a very delicate and sensitive organization, but then she is a girl
                  of excellent sense too; and this process of reasoning upon her fears gradually
                  restored her self-possession and in some degree quieted her nerves."</p>
               <p>The doctor nodded.</p>
               <p>"I know the class to which she belongs," he said, "the nervous-sanguine-lymphatic.
                  Proceed, madam."</p>
               <p>"Honoria reached at last, doctor, a degree of composure which induced her to
                  resolve upon discovering whether there were any grounds for what appeared to her
                  to be an absurd fancy, if not a dream—to ascertain, in a word, whether the garment
                  or the chair were not injured. If the weapon in the hand of the shadow had been a
                  real weapon and had pierced the garment, there must be some hole or rent to show
                  where the point had entered; if there were none, then it was a dream. This
                  resolution she proceeded to carry out. She rose from bed, stole in her bare feet
                  to the spot where the garment hung, raised it in the glimmering half-light from
                  the dying fire, and was about to examine it, when there suddenly fell to the
                  floor, with a ringing clash, an antique poniard—!"</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke shook his head.</p>
               <p>"The case is worse than I had supposed," he muttered.</p>
               <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6141-00000030"/>
               <p>Lady Brand continued, with white cheeks now, and a tremor in her voice:</p>
               <p>"The worst of all, the most terrifying event of all was yet to come!" she said,
                  almost in a whisper.</p>
               <p>The doctor bent forward—this time with a fixed and piercing look which indicated
                  that even his ever-firm nerves began to be affected by the strange recital.</p>
               <p>"That is not all, then—but I had forgotten!—the 'horror'—the 'weight upon the
                  shoulders'—!"</p>
               <p>"You recall the delirious raving of my child, I see!" said Lady Brand, trembling.
                  "A few words more will tell you all. When the weapon fell, or when Honoria thought
                  it fell, she recoiled from the chair, turning her head from it, and covering her
                  face, when suddenly, she declares, some horrible thing or being leaped or fell
                  upon her shoulders—clutched her, and, crouching like a cat, gibbered and tore at
                  her with its teeth!"</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke had grown a little pale, and shook his head ominously.</p>
               <p>"What next?" he said, in a low voice.</p>
               <p>"It was then that Honoria uttered the piercing shriek which attracted her
                  companions to her chamber, and fell fainting upon the floor. After this she
                  remembers nothing."</p>
               <p>"One word before you finish, madam," and Dr. Vandyke knit his brows. "You say that
                  Honoria recoiled from the chair, turning away her head?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Then her back was to the large chair?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Her face to the mirror?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Did she look into the mirror—if so, what did she see, or fancy she saw?"</p>
               <p>"I was about to tell you," said Lady Brand, in the same awe-struck whisper. "The
                  apartment was nearly in total darkness, but Honoria's quick glance toward the
                  mirror showed her a shadowy, crouching <emph>thing</emph> upon her back—a nameless
                  something of no defined shape—then, paralyzed by this final terror, she lost
                  consciousness and fell heavily to the floor."</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke remained for some moments buried in gloomy meditation. He then raised
                  his head, and uttered a deep sigh.</p>
               <p>"Nothing, of course, was found when the young ladies went to the chamber?" he
                  said.</p>
               <p>"Nothing."</p>
               <p>"The garment was on the chair still?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"There were no rents in it?"</p>
               <p>"None."</p>
               <p>"No dagger on the floor?"</p>
               <p>"None."</p>
               <p>"And Honoria was alone—the chamber had no other occupant?"</p>
               <p>"I know that there was no one else in the apartment; I reached it almost as soon
                  as the girls, and, thinking that a dog or something else beneath the bed—there is
                  no other place of concealment—had frightened Honoria, instituted an immediate
                  search."</p>
               <p>"And there was nothing?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing."</p>
               <p>"The room has no closet?"</p>
               <p>"None, doctor."</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke reflected again, preserving the same melancholy silence.</p>
               <p>"And this is all, madam?"</p>
               <p>"All, doctor."</p>
               <p>"You have omitted nothing?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing whatever that I can recall."</p>
               <p>The doctor uttered something like a groan.</p>
               <p>"God help us!" he muttered.</p>
               <p>"O doctor, what do you mean?"</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke looked at the lady with eyes full of pity.</p>
               <p>"I mean, madam," he said, solemnly, "that the inscrutable Power which rules this
                  world and all the worlds has seen fit to visit you with a great misfortune."</p>
               <p>"O doctor, doctor! speak!—tell me—!"</p>
               <p>"You are strong, and should know. Honoria has—dormant in her mental organization,
                  and in process of development at this moment—insanity."</p>
               <p>Lady Brand sobbed hopelessly, covering her pale face with her hands.</p>
               <p>"And is there no cure?" she said, in a broken voice.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps," said Dr. Vandyke. "The case is a strange one, madam—you see I waste no
                  time in commonplace consolation, in soothing expressions. Your lady friends will
                  furnish that—I am the physician, and this time the physician not only of the body
                  but the mind. I have cured the body nearly—the mind remains; and to cure that will
                  be more difficult. I shall nevertheless do all in my power, leaving the rest to
                  that all-wise and all-merciful Being disregarded or not believed in by fools and
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">savants,</foreign> but in whom I believe; to whom I
                  look, as the first great cause, the arbiter of all."</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke rose as he spoke.</p>
               <p>"To-morrow, madam," he said, "I shall make my diagnosis fully, and commence my
                  treatment."</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>XXV. TREATMENT.</head>
               <p>WHEN Dr. Vandyke came down-stairs on the next morning, he found Lady Brand in the
                  library, and requested her to walk upon the lawn and converse with him for a few
                  moments.</p>
               <p>The lady rose quickly, drying with her handkerchief some tears that were in her
                  eyes, and the two persons walked out beneath the great oaks and disappeared.</p>
               <p>They did not return for an hour. As they came back toward the house, it was
                  obvious, from the expression of Dr. Vandyke's countenance, that the result of the
                  colloquy had been such as to afford him extreme satisfaction. The melancholy air
                  which had characterized him on the preceding evening had disappeared; his demeanor
                  was animated, and he murmured:</p>
               <p>"I know, or think I know! Now, to find if my knowledge will prove of any
                  avail!"</p>
               <p>On the same evening, he went to Honoria's chamber with Lady Brand. The girl lay
                  still and quiet in her great white bed, her eyes dreamy and full of apathy.</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke uttered a cheerful laugh. "Well, my dear child," he said, as he
                  approached her, "the roses are coming back to their native soil—your checks."</p>
               <p>Honoria raised her great eyes, set like stars in the wasted face, and looked at
                  the speaker in a dreamy way. Then she tried to smile, but closed her eyes as
                  though the effort overcame her.</p>
               <p>"I have never seen anybody get well so quickly," said Dr. Vandyke, in a cheery
                  voice.</p>
               <p>Honoria made no reply.</p>
               <p>"You have been quite sick, my child," continued the doctor, in his hearty tone,
                  "and we have all felt much solicitude; but nothing in this world is unalloyed—not
                  even unhappiness. Sickness has its comforts; one of these is the sympathy of our
                  friends, and everybody has been to see you. Those who could not be admitted, have
                  left messages, and my young friend Edmund Innis commissioned me—"</p>
               <p>The pale face suddenly flushed, and the great eyes opened. At that name, some of
                  the apathy disappeared.</p>
               <p>"His message is, that you must soon get well, and—"</p>
               <p>The doctor bent down and added:</p>
               <p>"He says you are his sunshine, and that he cannot live in darkness."</p>
               <p>It is to be hoped that this flat falsehood was blotted from the book of the
                  recording angel. It caused Honoria to look up eagerly, and brought back to her
                  face something almost like animation.<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6141-00000031"/> Dr.
                  Vandyke saw his advantage, and pressed it.</p>
               <p>"Well, little Miss Sunshine," he said, laughing, "I hope you will begin to shine
                  down-stairs very soon now, and, when I return to visit this respectable family, I
                  expect to find you tripping over the lawn, or dancing gavottes and reels to the
                  music of the fiddle."</p>
               <p>Honoria shook her head.</p>
               <p>"You are not going away, doctor?" she said.</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"And leave me?"</p>
               <p>"Why not?"</p>
               <p>"I am not well," she said, wearily.</p>
               <p>"You will be in a week."</p>
               <p>"No, no!"</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke gazed at her with his subtile and penetrating glance, and from the
                  quiet change in his expression it was evident that he had made up his mind to act
                  promptly and with vigor.</p>
               <p>"Why do you indulge this melancholy mood, my dear child," he said, "you are
                  rapidly recovering. You sleep well, do you not?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," came in a hesitating voice.</p>
               <p>"No fancies, and imaginary sounds, I suppose—no <emph>low breathing</emph>—ha!
                  ha!—from behind your bed?"</p>
               <p>Honoria shuddered, closing her eyes.</p>
               <p>"That was the most absurd and laughable idea imaginable," said Dr. Vandyke; "or at
                  least to be frightened by it. A <emph>breathing!</emph>—why, there it is now!"</p>
               <p>Honoria half started up.</p>
               <p>"O doctor!" she exclaimed.</p>
               <p>"What is it? I'll find!"</p>
               <p>And, raising the counterpane, the astute Dr. Vandyke drew forth a small spaniel,
                  the pet of Lou Brand, who had placed the dog there while Honoria was asleep, in
                  compliance with the request of the physician.</p>
               <p>That personage burst into a hearty laugh.</p>
               <p>"Well, after all, you were right, my dear!" he said, "there was a frightful
                     <emph>low breathing</emph>—Carlo, to wit."</p>
               <p>It could be seen at a glance that this prosaic and commonplace explanation of one
                  source of her nocturnal terror had made a profound impression upon Honoria. She
                  did not speak, but her eyes spoke volumes.</p>
               <p>"This habit that dogs have of creeping under beds to sleep or protect themselves
                  from flies, is one of the greatest objections to making household pets of them,"
                  said the doctor.</p>
               <p>And, turning to Carlo, he added, laughing:</p>
               <p>"Come, my interesting young friend, will you be good enough to entertain us by
                  your peculiar wheeze, attributable doubtless to dog-asthma?"</p>
               <p>As though in response to these words, Carlo, who had stretched himself upon the
                  floor, uttered a low, asthmatic sound, as though he experienced a difficulty in
                  breathing.</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke looked sidewise at Honoria. She was silent, but he saw that her mind
                  had received the impression which he aimed to produce.</p>
               <p>"Go out now, if you please, Mr. Carlo," he said, "and play in the sunshine. There
                  is a superb amount of it to-day.—And, by-the-by, madam," he continued, addressing
                  Lady Brand, "is there not too much light in this chamber? It may be painful to
                  your daughter's eyes."</p>
               <p>Lady Brand went to close the blinds.</p>
               <p>"But no," said Dr. Vandyke, "'tis better, perhaps—more cheerful; and these shadows
                  moving to and fro on the wall are cool and refreshing. What singular shapes they
                  take!—the bough of the great oak yonder resembles an arm grasping a dagger, and,
                  if a good strong wind were to arise, I can fancy that the shadow, especially by
                  moonlight, would appear fearful—would become, in fancy, a gigantic arm and poniard
                  raised to strike."</p>
               <p>Honoria started again. She was gazing at Dr. Vandyke, with her whole soul in her
                  eyes.</p>
               <p>"What are you looking at, my dear child?" he said, cheerfully. "You really make me
                  afraid with your intense gaze! 'Tis as bad as the look of the old fellow up
                  yonder, who has been staring me out of countenance since my entrance. Look at
                  him!"</p>
               <p>And, taking a broomstick, Dr. Vandyke got up on a chair, thrust the stick into
                  Lord Ruthven's face, and assumed the persuasive attitude of a public lecturer upon
                  science, with accompanying diagrams.</p>
               <p>"Behold the queer conformation of the human eye, so well depicted here!" he said,
                  poking the portrait in the eye with a movement so awkward that it was wellnigh
                  impossible not to laugh. "It seems to follow you—speak to you—go to the right or
                  left, it still looks at you—stares at you: this absurd, painted, human
                  eye!—Really, madam," he said to Lady Brand, "I would take this grum and
                  disagreeable fellow out. Did you say the wall was disfigured behind it?"</p>
               <p>He suddenly thrust the picture to one side and showed the wall.</p>
               <p>"See, it is nothing; remove it, madam, or each time you enter this room you will
                  have this old Sir Blunderbuss following you with his eyes."</p>
               <p>"I will remove it to-day, doctor, as you suggest."</p>
               <p>"Oh, 'tis not so important. For myself, all the pictures in the world may stare at
                  me.—Shut your stupid eyes, my dear Sir Blunderbuss!"</p>
               <p>And administering a final poke with the broomstick into the face of the picture,
                  Dr. Vandyke descended, laughing, to the floor.</p>
               <p>As he did so, he glanced furtively at Honoria. She was smiling, either at the
                  absurd antics of the peculiar personage, or with a sense of relief from old fears
                  connected with the portrait, thus turned completely into ridicule.</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke prepared for the final scene of his acting. Suddenly he mounted into
                  the great high-backed chair standing in front of the fireplace, leaned his arms on
                  the huge back, rested his enormous head, with its long, elfin gray locks, upon the
                  folded arms, and grinned amiably. His expression was so ludicrous indeed that
                  Honoria uttered a slight laugh.</p>
               <p>A quick glance from Dr. Vandyke toward Lady Brand seemed to warn her that her aid
                  in the performance was now required. She moved to the space between the chair and
                  the mirror, and turned toward the latter, when, with the agility of a cat, Dr.
                  Vandyke bounded over the back of the great chair, and lit upon her shoulder.</p>
               <p>Honoria uttered a scream, and cried:</p>
               <p>"O doctor! The frightful <emph>thing!</emph>—the horror!"</p>
               <p>"The nonsense and tomfoolery, my dear child," said Dr. Vandyke, with a laugh, and
                  lighting on his feet; "call things by their right names, and let us have done with
                  absurdities."</p>
               <p>Honoria was looking at him with animated eyes. A sudden revulsion seemed to have
                  taken place in her feelings—a change in her mental condition. There was no longer
                  in her eyes that vacant and apathetic expression which had made the heart of the
                  experienced physician sink within him—a natural and healthful light began to
                  animate her glance; the medicine for the mind was having its effect, like the
                  medicine for the body.</p>
               <p>No sooner had Dr. Vandyke descried this longed-for alteration in Honoria, than he
                  said to Lady Brand:</p>
               <p>"I will go and write some letters now, madam, and I think Honoria had best sleep a
                  little. Place the bell beside her hand, and show me where I may write."</p>
               <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6141-00000032"/>
               <p>Lady Brand quietly obeyed, and went toward the door. Dr. Vandyke followed her, but
                  suddenly turned.</p>
               <p>"I had nearly forgotten you, my grum friend," he said to the portrait of Lord
                  Ruthven.</p>
               <p>And, mounting with agility upon a chair, he placed one foot upon an abutment of
                  the mantel-piece, and unceremoniously pulled down the fearful portrait, which he
                  tucked under his arm and bore from the apartment.</p>
               <p>As soon as the door was closed, Dr. Vandyke's face assumed its habitual expression
                  of coolness, and, taking a large handkerchief from his coat-pocket, he wiped his
                  forehead.</p>
               <p>"Acting fatigues!" he said; "but the end is reached—or nearly."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, doctor!"</p>
               <p>He deposited the picture in a corner, and gave it a kick.</p>
               <p>"I would put that rubbish in the garret, madam," he said, "and hang above
                  Honoria's fireplace a flower-piece or cheerful landscape. All depends now upon
                  trifles. Let her reflect, and allow my medicine to work. To-morrow I hope to
                  finish the cure."</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>XXVI. THE MYSTERY.</head>
               <p>WHEN Dr. Vandyke entered Honoria's chamber, on the next morning, his countenance
                  wore the same cheerful and animated expression.</p>
               <p>"Well, my dear," he said, "any more shadows—breathings, etc., etc.?"</p>
               <p>A last remnant of nervous agitation passed through the frame of the young lady,
                  but she replied in a sweet and serious tone:</p>
               <p>"Oh, no! I hope these fancies have left me—"</p>
               <p>"Ah, ah! you call them fancies, do you? That shows that you are cured."</p>
               <p>"They must have been fancies, doctor; and yet—that strange
                  <emph>thing</emph>—"</p>
               <p>The old shudder came back, and Honoria's eyes assumed an expression which induced
                  Dr. Vandyke to exclaim:</p>
               <p>"Come, come! every thing in order. I will come to that!"</p>
               <p>"Come to it, doctor?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my dear, I propose to deliver a brief lecture this morning upon natural
                  phenomena, with the effect produced by them upon the human mind. The term <hi
                     rend="i"/>lecture may fright you, but be tranquil. I am only to explain a
                  circumstance or two. It will be best that you should have this explanation."</p>
               <p>"Yes, doctor."</p>
               <p>"And you feel, I hope, that affection as well as professional duty prompts
                  it?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, indeed! Something in your face tells me that you have for me—that you
                  really—love me!"</p>
               <p>"My face interprets my heart, Honoria," said the eccentric physician, with a quick
                  flush; and, taking in his own the thin, white hand of the girl, he said,
                  earnestly:</p>
               <p>"I loved your mother once, Honoria—I mean, was her suitor; and what better means
                  could I adopt, to prove the sincerity of my love, than to cure her child?. I have
                  effected this cure, or nearly effected it—you see that I speak to you as a
                  rational being, which you were not yesterday morning."</p>
               <p>Honoria sobbed.</p>
               <p>"I fear I was not, doctor. Those terrible sights and sounds—"</p>
               <p>"Stop, Honoria! No more nervous tremors—no more shuddering. Listen to me, and the
                  last remains of your fright will disappear."</p>
               <p>The girl raised her head and gazed at him with deep earnestness.</p>
               <p>"Let us divide the phenomena, or supposed phenomena, into four parts," said Dr.
                  Vandyke, coolly. "You hear a low breathing from the bed in your chamber; the eyes
                  of a picture make you afraid; a shadowy dagger strikes at your night-dress; and
                  some nameless thing leaps on your shoulders. Is that all?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, doctor," was the reply, in a low and nervous voice.</p>
               <p>"Well, now, for elucidation of these terrible phenomena," said the physician.</p>
               <p>"You repaired to your chamber on the night of the performance of this absurd
                     <emph>dumb-cake</emph> ceremony, in a high state of nervous excitement,
                  consequent upon terror at the storm through which you had passed, and
                  superstitious fear. Well, the first thing you hear is a mysterious breathing from
                  your bed—then a picture stares at you—then an arm wields a poniard. Let us stop
                  there for the present, and let me ask you if you now doubt the real character of
                  those phenomena? The breathing from the bed was the wind, or a dog, or a cat,
                  or—nothing! The eyes of the portrait looked at you, as the eyes of all good
                  portraits look at all persons, whatever position is taken up, either to the right,
                  to the left, or in front. Lastly, the gigantic and frightful arm, grasping the
                  dagger, seen when you were half asleep, and half conscious, was simply the shadow
                  of that bough of the oak yonder through the window, which shadow was cast by the
                  moon, and waved, as the bough waved, in a manner so peculiarly terrifying that it
                  produced brain-fever. So far you understand, do you not, my child?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, doctor," came in a low tone from Honoria, "but—"</p>
               <p>"The horror! the frightful, nameless something—the nightmare, bugbear, call it
                  what you will!"</p>
               <p>The doctor burst out laughing, in spite of Honoria's quick shudder.</p>
               <p>"That was the only <emph>real</emph> part of the whole phenomena," said Dr.
                  Vandyke, coolly. "The thing, or individual, rather, who leaped from that chair, as
                  you saw <emph>me</emph> leap, was—Meta!"</p>
               <p>Honoria half rose, exclaiming:</p>
               <p>"Meta! doctor?"</p>
               <p>"Meta," was the calm response, "who had hidden herself in this apartment to
                  frighten you during the ordeal of the dumb-cake—who may or may not have uttered
                  the low breathing from the bed—who certainly did spring upon your shoulders."</p>
               <p>"O doctor! is it possible? It cannot be that Meta could have been so cruel—"</p>
               <p>"Meta is a lunatic, or nearly so," was the calm reply, "and lunatics are both
                  cunning and malevolent."</p>
               <p>"But what motive could she have?"</p>
               <p>"To frighten you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, doctor."</p>
               <p>"Hatred arising from—jealousy."</p>
               <p>"Jealousy!"</p>
               <p>Honoria gazed at Dr. Vandyke, as she uttered this word, with profound
                  astonishment.</p>
               <p>"Yes, my child," said the physician. "Listen. As soon as I entered this house, and
                  ascertained the causes of your condition, I concentrated my whole mind upon the
                     question—<emph>who</emph> was it that frightened you—not <emph>what?</emph> A
                  human being must have caused you to fall with that piercing shriek; and the
                  mystery was—what human being? No servant would have dared—no young lady friend
                  have been so cruel. Thus the irresistible conclusion was, that some idiot, or
                  other weak-minded person, must have been guilty of this act, and there was such a
                  person in the family. So far, the chain of reasoning was perfect; but what motive
                  could exist for the act of this girl, who was supposed to love you? Even with
                  idiots there is a motive, and I questioned Lady Brand, the servants, and all, so
                  closely that I discovered what I wished to know."</p>
               <p>"The motive—O doctor what could it have been? Jealousy? Jealousy of
                     <emph>me—!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Precisely," said Dr. Vandyke;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6141-00000033"/> "Meta
                  happens to have fallen in love with a young gentleman named Edmund Innis; she
                  knows that he loves you—there, the words are uttered!—she overheard, in the
                  drawing-room, the whole discussion in regard to the dumb-cake, and she hid in this
                  chamber behind the bed—watched you in your sleep—concealed herself in this
                  chair—saw you rise—leaped on your shoulders gibbering as insane persons do, and,
                  when you shrieked and fell, escaped from the apartment."</p>
               <p>Honoria drew a long breath, and for some moments remained silent; at last she
                  murmured:</p>
               <p>"How do you know this, doctor?"</p>
               <p>"From Edmund Innis, who is able to communicate by signs with the girl, and
                  extracted the confession from her."</p>
               <p>Honoria covered her face with her hands. She was quietly weeping.</p>
               <p>"It was cruel in Meta," she murmured. "I thought she loved me too much to—"</p>
               <p>"To love young Master Edmund more?" said the doctor, with a smile. "No, Honoria;
                  that passion exceeds in force all others—is as strong in Meta as in Edmund Innis,
                  only <emph>he</emph> loves <emph>you.</emph>"</p>
               <p>Honoria's face was covered with blushes, but a happy smile shone through her
                  tears.</p>
               <p>"At last!" said Dr. Vandyke, rising. "You are now well, my dear Honoria! let me
                  call you dear. I call few so! You are well in body and mind, in heart as in brain.
                  God watch over you, my child, and guard you from all danger, and give you this
                  honest gentleman, Edmund Innis, to be your faithful husband! That is my prayer,
                  Honoria, the prayer of the old dried-up physician who loved once a human
                  being—your mother. Farewell now, Honoria!"</p>
               <p>And, stooping, the eccentric personage touched the girl's brow with his lips, left
                  the apartment, and on the same evening set out on his return to the capital.</p>
               <p>His patient was cured.</p>

               <head>XXVII. BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY.</head>
               <p>SINCE the scenes which we have just described more than three months had passed.
                  It was the depth of winter, and the city of Williamsburg, the capital of Virginia,
                  residence of the viceroy, and centre of fashion for the time, was in all its
                  glory.</p>
               <p>Before a mirror, in an upper apartment of a house near the governor's "palace," as
                  it was called, Honoria was standing one evening, busily arranging, in
                  multitudinous braids and plaits, the dark locks of Meta, who half reclined, with a
                  delighted expression of countenance, in a velvet arm-chair, gazing at herself in
                  the low-swung mirror.</p>
               <p>Honoria, who stood behind the dark little beauty at her work, was clad in her
                  dressing-gown; her hair was in disordered curls upon her shoulders, and her toilet
                  was yet to be made. At a window near stood her sister Lou, in magnificent
                  ball-costume—all lace, satin, jewels, and powder—erect, superb, turning her head
                  from moment to moment to gaze at the pair in front of the mirror, and beating an
                  impatient tattoo upon the window-pane.</p>
               <p>The last words of Dr. Vandyke to Lady Brand, on leaving "Rivanna," after Honoria's
                  convalescence, had been:</p>
               <p>"Madam, if you wish your daughter to regain her roses and lose the mortal pallor
                  you see in her cheeks, take her away from Rivanna. Give her gayety, change of
                  scene, distraction of some kind: what she now requires is forgetfulness."</p>
               <p>Lady Brand had repeated these words to her husband, and that gentleman had
                  responded—chin elevated, hand passing slowly and with dignity between his collar
                  and his neck;</p>
               <p>"Hum!—ha!—gayety, distraction, change of scene? Well, madam, that comports with my
                  own views. I have affairs of some importance to transact at Williamsburg, and
                  design going thither. You and the young ladies may accompany me, and make a
                  protracted stay if you desire to do so."</p>
               <p>The affairs of importance were imaginary. Colonel Brand had long promised himself
                  the luxury of exhibiting the beauty of his daughters in the viceregal capital;
                  and, greatly alarmed by the now unmistakable attachment between Innis and Honoria,
                  he had already determined to remove the young lady to new scenes, and, if
                  possible, effect a match between her and some wealthy young scion of the seaboard.
                  Dr. Vandyke's advice, therefore, coincided with his own views. No time was lost in
                  making arrangements for spending the winter with his family in Williamsburg,
                  whither Lady Brand decided to go. A house was procured and furnished; every
                  article of comfort and luxury sent down; and, in due time, the old, lumbering
                  chariot, drawn by its four horses, landed the colonel and his family at their
                  "town mansion" in the capital.</p>
               <p>On the evening when we present the young ladies to the reader they were preparing
                  for their first formal ball or "assembly"—to take place at the palace of his
                  excellency. Or, rather, Miss Lou Brand had made her preparations, while Honoria,
                  busy with Meta, had not begun her own.</p>
               <p>"For Heaven's sake, Honoria, make haste and have done with Meta!" exclaimed Miss
                  Lou Brand, at last, out of all patience. "The chariot will be at the door in half
                  an hour, and you'll not be dressed."</p>
               <p>"That is time enough, sister," said Honoria, with her habitual smile, full of
                  sweetness, and a little sadness.</p>
               <p>"Time enough! Who ever heard of a young lady dressing for a ball in
                  thirty-minutes? Your hair alone will take an hour!"</p>
               <p>"If I choose to spend an hour arranging it, sister; but I shall not."</p>
               <p>"But, begin—begin!"</p>
               <p>"Meta's hair is nearly done."</p>
               <p>"Why in the world did you not leave it to one of the maids?"</p>
               <p>"Meta wished <emph>me</emph> to arrange it, sister, and you know how obstinate the
                  poor child is when she takes a fancy."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I do—hateful little creature!" said Miss Lou Brand, with emphasis.</p>
               <p>"We must make allowance for her infirmity, sister. She is very unfortunate, and
                  has few pleasures. Something—I know not what—has made her attach great importance
                  to this ball—to her appearance—"</p>
               <p>"Something!" exclaimed the elder beauty, with a satirical but not ill-natured
                  laugh; Lou Brand was incapable of <emph>ill-nature.</emph> "'Something!' you know
                  very well what that something is: Edmund Innis will be there, and Meta is—in love
                  with his lordship, Mr. Wythe's worshipful law-student!"</p>
               <p>Honoria blushed, and Meta, as though she knew when Innis's name was pronounced, by
                  the very movement of any one's lips in uttering his name, riveted her eyes with a
                  dark and angry expression upon the elder young lady, who thereupon burst into a
                  ringing laugh.</p>
               <p>"The world is full of <foreign xml:lang="FRA">finesse,</foreign> secret motives,
                  and things <foreign xml:lang="FRA">sans les cartes!</foreign>" she cried. "Women,
                  even girls like Meta, are eternally scheming! But, come, come, Honora!—I won't
                  tell you that you too are blushing—ha, ha!—but I do tell you that, unless you
                  commence your toilet, you'll not be at the ball."</p>
               <p>"There, there, sister, I've done," said Honoria, hurriedly. "At least, Meta, poor
                  thing, is pleased; and, it is so good to make people happy, sister! I'll get ready
                  in a moment."</p>
               <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6141-00000034"/>
               <p>And this remarkable young lady, who had forgotten her own hair, to fix a poor
                  girl's, began energetically dressing.</p>
               <p>"No!" exclaimed Lou Brand, resolutely, "you <emph>shan't</emph> throw, your things
                  on in that way, Honoria! If you don't know it, I'll tell you, that you are going
                  to be the belle of the assembly—the centre of all eyes; and I don't intend to have
                  those hateful old dowagers in turbans, ranged, like sunflowers and hollyhocks gone
                  to seed, along the wall, nodding and tittering behind their fans, and chattering
                  to each other, and whispering: 'Just see Miss Honoria Brand, the beauty! Did you
                  ever see so frightful a toilet?' No!"</p>
               <p>And, sweeping toward Honoria, the energetic beauty threw down her pearl fan, took
                  possession of her sister, and busily began dressing her hair, which, under the
                  plastic fingers, soon rose in an exquisite tower of curls, brilliant, powdered,
                  and interwoven with pearls.</p>
               <p>"Now your hair is something like! Where is your white satin?"</p>
               <p>To this abrupt question Honoria replied, rather timidly:</p>
               <p>"I thought of wearing my blue silk, sister."</p>
               <p>"Your blue silk?"</p>
               <p>"Why not?"</p>
               <p>"Did anybody ever hear of such an idea? You are utterly absurd, Honoria!—at the
                  governor's assembly!"</p>
               <p>"That does not impress me greatly; and you know I am not a bride, sister."</p>
               <p>"You never will be, either, at this rate, madam! Your blue silk! You positively
                  shall not!"</p>
               <p>"Well, have it your way, sister: the white satin let it be."</p>
               <p>A maid quickly laid out the gorgeous costume upon a bed; the young lady's toilet
                  was finished, and her sister, retreating a step, looked at her, with head
                  sidewise, admiringly. Then she rushed at her, rearranged a curl, retied a bow of
                  ribbon, slightly drew a fold of lace across one of the snowy shoulders, and
                  exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"You really are a beauty, Honoria; and will have everybody looking at you!"</p>
               <p>Honoria blushed and smiled. What woman could listen to such an observation coldly?
                  She <emph>gazed</emph> at herself in the glass, and then, as the thought came to
                  her "He will see me," her cheeks grew crimson. In a corner of the chamber, Meta,
                  with her strange, crouching attitude, was watching her. Miss Lou Brand, who seemed
                  to understand every thing and everybody, turned and looked at her, and quickly ran
                  to her, and seized her arm.</p>
               <p>"Go on, you little wretch, and get into the coach—I hear it at the door!" she
                  exclaimed.</p>
               <p>With which, Miss Lou Brand hustled Meta out of the room, and shut the door.</p>
               <p>"Now I feel more at my ease!" she exclaimed. "That hateful creature was standing
                  there, <emph>glowering</emph> at you, dear, and thinking that Edmund Innis would
                  see her, too! What a goose! He has no eyes for any one but you! And now stop
                  blushing, and come on. Your blue silk? Absurd! The white satin! And you shall
                  marry him, and be happy, and wear white as a bride yet, dear!—and I mean to dance
                  at your wedding—and let myself be kissed, too, by—my brother Edmund!"</p>

               <head>XXVIII. THE ASSEMBLY.</head>
               <p>ALL Williamsburg was in commotion. Through the frosty air of the clear winter
                  night flashed chariots drawn by four-in-hands; gallant young beaux mounted upon
                  prancing through-breds followed, and the capital was all joy, merriment, and
                  uproar.</p>
               <p>Colonel Brand had selected the most opportune season for his visit to the city,
                  and on this night the carnival culminated nated. Hitherto the days had been full
                  of pleasure and enjoyment; balls, races, tea-drinkings, riding-excursions, and
                  card-parties, had been the order of the day; but these were all thrown in the
                  shade by the coming "assembly."</p>
               <p>Colonel Brand's chariot stopped before the great gate of the governor's palace, in
                  front of which a crowd of motley character had assembled to look at the
                  richly-dressed beauties, as they descended from their vehicles; and up the broad
                  walk, edged with Scottish lindens, from which were suspended colored lanterns to
                  light the guests, the colonel and his family advanced, and entered the broad
                  door.</p>
               <p>In the large apartment, adorned with full-length portraits of the king and queen,
                  the crowd was already great, and it would be difficult to convey an idea of the
                  brilliance of the spectacle. Silk, velvet, lace, and jewels, caught and threw back
                  in dazzling splendor the light of the great chandeliers overhead, and the stately
                  gentlemen and smiling beauties of an epoch famed for such, were mingled in one
                  great crowd, rich-colored as the dream of some grand painter. Sonorous music rang;
                  the buzz of conversation mingled with it; and in the centre of the apartment his
                  smiling excellency the royal governor received and bowed low to his guests with
                  his well-known urbanity and elegance.</p>
               <p>He was leaning on the arm of his confidential secretary, Lord Ruthven, who, pale,
                  clad in a rich but sombre costume, and with his black hair only slightly powdered,
                  surveyed the company with courteous but stately attention. Despite obvious
                  efforts, however, Ruthven scarcely smiled; something plainly bore heavily on this
                  man's heart. In fact, the melancholy young nobleman had never ceased to be haunted
                  by his possessing thought, his mysterious dread. Remaining in Virginia only at the
                  express and repeated request of the governor, he had never lost the apprehension
                  which rendered his life miserable; and, on this evening, resembled, in his black
                  costume, with his dark eyes set in his pale face, a veritable "death's head at the
                  feast."</p>
               <p>Suddenly the governor felt a convulsive pressure upon his arm; and Lord Ruthven,
                  who had grown as pale as a corpse, whispered in a low voice in his ear:</p>
               <p>"Who is she, my lord?"</p>
               <p>The governor turned and looked at the speaker. His eyes were distended, and his
                  finger indicated a young lady who had just entered.</p>
               <p>"What ails you, Ruthven?" the governor said, in great astonishment.</p>
               <p>"Who is she?" repeated Ruthven, in the same tone.</p>
               <p>The governor followed the direction of the trembling finger, and said:</p>
               <p>"The young lady in white satin, with pearls in her hair?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my lord."</p>
               <p>"Miss Brand—the daughter of my friend Colonel Brand. Your solitary way of living
                  alone accounts for your ignorance, my dear Ruthven."</p>
               <p>"Brand! Brand!" murmured Ruthven, in a voice almost inaudible; "my father had a
                  friend—a Colonel Brand."</p>
               <p>"'Tis the same; and Miss Brand is a beauty, is she not? Nay, there are two
                  beauties in the family. See! that tall damsel is also a daughter of the colonel.
                  They are approaching. Here they are. Let me present you."</p>
               <p>"No! no!" exclaimed the young nobleman, almost fiercely, "not for the
                  universe—never!—that is—I mean—pardon me, my lord, I am not well
                  tonight—and—another time—"</p>
               <p>The governor had not time to think of these singular words, or even to look at the
                  speaker. Colonel Brand was within a few feet of him, accompanied by the ladies of
                  his family, and it was utterly impossible for Ruthven to retire<pb n="64-65"
                     xml:id="VAC6141-00000035"/> without obvious and gross discourtesy. With one
                  hand, the governor, in fact, detained him, the other hand grasped Colonel Brand's,
                  and the host cordially welcomed his guest, and was presented to the ladies.</p>
               <p>Ruthven was on the point of tearing himself away; his agitation was frightful, and
                  he seemed to have lost all self-control. In the midst, however, of the sort of
                  vertigo which had seized upon him, he heard the governor say:</p>
               <p>"Miss Brand, may I have the honor of presenting my friend Lord Ruthven?"</p>
               <p>The young nobleman bowed low, raised his hand to his breast, as though a sudden
                  pain assailed him, uttered some hurried words, and, in spite of every effort of
                  the governor to detain him, retired from the spot, and sought to leave the
                  apartment. This, however, was no easy task. The crowd had become so dense that to
                  make way through it was almost impossible. He found the way barred on every hand,
                  could only move to and fro, borne like a leaf on the waves of silk and velvet, and
                  a sudden movement of the mass almost made him lose his balance. In regaining it,
                  he placed his foot on a young lady's train; the young lady moved at the same
                  instant, and the consequence was that the satin train was rent nearly in
                  twain.</p>
               <p>The instincts of the gentleman triumphed over the cruel agony of the individual,
                  and Lord Ruthven, bowing low, exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"A thousand pardons, madam, for my awkwardness!"</p>
               <p>"It is nothing, sir!—do not annoy yourself—the crowd is so great—"</p>
               <p>And the beautiful eyes of Honoria were fixed upon Lord Ruthven's face—a smile upon
                  the bright lips. As she looked at him, his own sombre glance met the young lady's,
                  and he shuddered.</p>
               <p>Honoria had gathered up the torn skirt, thrown it over her snowy arm, and now
                  repeated, in her frank and simple voice:</p>
               <p>"It is impossible to avoid these accidents, I assure you, my lord, in such crowded
                  rooms, and this will not inconvenience me at all."</p>
               <p>"But—in dancing—there is a minuet—"</p>
               <p>"The words were forced from the lips by a tremendous effort. Honoria did not seem
                  to observe the fact; her little red-heeled slipper was beating time delightedly to
                  the stately music.</p>
               <p>"Oh, I shall dance, I assure you, in spite of it."</p>
               <p>The die was cast. It was a fatal necessity, in accordance with the etiquette of
                  the time, that Lord Ruthven should solicit the young lady's hand for the minuet.
                  He did so in a voice which those who knew him would have scarce recognized as his
                  own. Honoria made him a little courtesy of delighted assent, and in a moment they
                  were dancing together in the stately <foreign xml:lang="FRA">menuet de la
                     cour.</foreign> It was fortunate that nearly all eyes were fixed upon the
                  little "Brand beauty," as Honoria began to be called; upon her fair face full of
                  happy smiles bent toward her bosom in the low courtesy—the slender figure moving
                  with exquisite grace—the beautiful eyes, dancing with youthful joy beneath the
                  piled-up curls, the powder, and the interwoven pearls. The figure of the girl was
                     <emph>sunshine</emph> incarnate—the figure of Ruthven in his dark dress,
                     <emph>shadow.</emph> Innis, looking at them from a corner of the apartment—for
                  he had returned to Williamsburg even after Colonel Brand's arrival, and was one of
                  the guests on this night—Innis, gazing at them, not without some trouble in his
                  frank face, felt a sort of shudder, in presence of the funeral partner of his
                  idol.</p>
               <p>The stately minuet bowed itself through its splendid evolutions, and came to an
                  end. Lord Ruthven stopped suddenly; remained as motionless as a figure ure of
                  black marble for an instant, then, with a visible tremor of his nerves, offered
                  Honoria his arm, and was lost again in the crowd.</p>
               <p>"The music of his excellency is admirable—you are fond of dancing—Miss Brand?"</p>
               <p>His voice had the same forced tones—tones almost convulsive.</p>
               <p>"Very fond, my lord," said Honoria, wondering at the evident agitation of her
                  companion.</p>
               <p>"And the gavotte—the reel—the latter, I think, is our own Scottish reel?"</p>
               <p>"We call it the Virginia reel already, and it is even a greater favorite than the
                  minuet."</p>
               <p>"It is natural that the ladies of Virginia then should prefer their own dance,
                  Miss Brand. And you are a native of Virginia, I believe?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, indeed, my lord."</p>
               <p>"You have never visited England—Scotland—I mean the Old World?"</p>
               <p>He looked at her with singular intensity as he spoke, and seemed to await her
                  reply with very extraordinary agitation.</p>
               <p>"I have never been out of Virginia in my life, sir," said Honoria, and, laughing
                  with the frankness and simplicity which made her so charming, she added:</p>
               <p>"I should think you might know so, my lord, by my provincial air and
                  appearance."</p>
               <p>"By no means—Miss Brand is wholly mistaken. Your father, however, has visited the
                  Old World—was a friend, I think, of my own father, the late Lord Ruthven. Then we
                  two should be friends."</p>
               <p>Why he uttered the words he could never understand. He did not mean them, for
                  Ruthven had registered a solemn oath to leave the city of Williamsburg on the very
                  next day.</p>
               <p>The interview lasted but a few moments longer. Suddenly Honoria said, with a
                  little flutter in her voice, to some one:</p>
               <p>"I am <emph>very</emph> glad to see you!"</p>
               <p>And, raising his eyes, Ruthven saw within three paces of him, Edmund Innis.</p>
               <p>The young man, who had bowed low over the little hand which Honoria held out to
                  him, made a bow also to Lord Ruthven.</p>
               <p>"I am pleased to find that your lordship has recovered," he said.</p>
               <p>Innis held the hand of Honoria still, as he spoke; and Ruthven gazed with an
                  indescribable expression upon the graceful figures of the youth and maiden, as
                  they were grouped thus under the brilliant chandelier.</p>
               <p>"Yes—many thanks, sir—yes, I have, I believe, recovered, and—you have returned to
                  the capital, Mr. Innis?"</p>
               <p>"To prosecute my studies, my lord. I design becoming a counseller one of these
                  days."</p>
               <p>"May your lot be happy, sir," Ruthven said, "though I shall not have the
                  opportunity to witness your forensic triumphs. I shall return on the next vessel
                  to Europe."</p>
               <p>"Indeed, my lord!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I am under the necessity of so doing."</p>
               <p>Innis had offered Honoria his arm, Lord Ruthven having released the young
                  lady.</p>
               <p>"Your lordship will not set out for Europe, I hope," said Honoria, smiling,
                  "without calling to see us—my father will be happy, I am sure, to see the son of
                  his friend the late Lord Ruthven."</p>
               <p>The young nobleman bowed low. Before he was aware of the words which he was
                  uttering, he said:</p>
               <p>"I shall be very happy to pay my respects to Colonel Brand and yourself, Miss
                  Brand."</p>
               <p>With a second bow he was lost in the crowd, and ten minutes afterward he had left
                  the ballroom, and gained his lodgings.</p>

               <head>XXIX. LINKS OF THE CHAIN.</head>
               <p>FERGUS was in the chamber, silent, erect, and respectful. His master threw himself
                  into a chair, and said, in a hoarse voice:</p>
               <p>"Fergus, I have seen the woman!"</p>
               <p>"The woman, my lord?" was the cool reply, "and what is she like?"</p>
               <p>"Like?—Good Heavens!—beautiful, very beautiful, and like—like—the spectre!"</p>
               <p>For some moments a deep silence reigned in the apartment. Lord Ruthven then said,
                  in the same low, hoarse voice:</p>
               <p>"We go to-morrow!"</p>
               <p>"To Europe, my lord?"</p>
               <p>"Yes!"</p>
               <p>"Good, my lord."</p>
               <p>"There is a vessel?"</p>
               <p>"I think so."</p>
               <p>"Heaven grant it!"</p>
               <p>"And this time your lordship is determined really to go?"</p>
               <p>"Resolutely determined!"</p>
               <p>Fergus made a movement of his head, and began folding the articles of his master's
                  wardrobe and laying them carefully in a huge trunk, in one corner of the
                  apartment.</p>
               <p>For some moments Lord Ruthven remained perfectly silent, his breast heaving.</p>
               <p>"I tried to avoid her—to avoid making her acquaintance!" he muttered, "but Fate
                  forced it upon me!"</p>
               <p>"Eh?" grunted Fergus, dryly, continuing to pack the trunk.</p>
               <p>"It happened as before in the case of—the man."</p>
               <p>"Your lordship means young Mr. Innis?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. That was what is called an accident. This, too, was—an accident."</p>
               <p>"Do you believe in accidents, my lord?"</p>
               <p>"No!"</p>
               <p>"Nor I. There are none."</p>
               <p>"None, and yet to think that, despite every effort, I am thrown with—these people!
                  Does it not seem strange?"</p>
               <p>"Every thing is strange in this world, my lord. But I am glad we are going."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, we will go! Nothing shall withhold me. Cursed Fate that drives me! Oh,
                  why, Fergus, am I not a poor common mortal like the rest of my kind? Why am I the
                  exception, the anomaly, the one being denied all happiness?"</p>
               <p>"Your lordship speaks mysteriously. You would say—"</p>
               <p>Lord Ruthven was silent again, and slowly his pale face flushed.</p>
               <p>"I mean," he said, in a low tone, "that were I not Ruthven, and therefore
                  accursed, I might—possibly—who knows?—find some solace, some happiness, in—"</p>
               <p>He stopped, and knit his brows. His eyes were fixed upon the floor. His face
                  filled with blushes.</p>
               <p>"She is very beautiful!" he said, as though to himself.</p>
               <p>It is impossible to describe the expression of Fergus, as he listened to this
                  unmistakable avowal. The old face assumed an air of scorn, of pity, of
                  apprehension, of affection, wonderful to see. He stopped packing the trunk, and,
                  looking at his master intently, said:</p>
               <p>"Is your lordship really going tomorrow? If not, 'twill be useless to continue
                  these preparations."</p>
               <p>"Going? Certainly I am going!" exclaimed Lord Ruthven, almost angrily; "what made
                  you dream that I was not really going?"</p>
               <p>"I did not dream it, I thought it, and what made me think it was—experience!" said
                  Fergus, coolly.</p>
               <p>"Experience! what do you mean?"</p>
               <p>"I mean, my lord, that you said you were going before—when you first saw
                     the<emph>man</emph>—and you did not go!"</p>
               <p>"You know <emph>why</emph> I did not go—because cause I could not, and the
                     <emph>man</emph> went away! And I will add that it is disagreeable to me to be
                  thus catechised!"</p>
               <p>An angry scowl accompanied the words. Fergus stopped suddenly, and turned to his
                  master with a strange mixture of offence and mortification upon his old
                  weather-beaten face.</p>
               <p>Ruthven for a moment said nothing. His heavy breathing was audible in the silence.
                  Suddenly he rose, went to Fergus, and seized his hand in his own—</p>
               <p>"Forgive me, Fergus—my poor, good Fergus! poor, since you have so unhappy, so
                  wayward and unjust a master! Forgive me, old friend—I am mad, I think, to wound
                  thus the only heart on earth that beats true to me! But I have been unnerved
                  to-night—I scarce know what I say. That face! that smile!—the lips, the hair,
                  all—they were the same, the very same, Fergus! There was no room for doubt—I have
                  seen her, heard her—'tis she! And listen, Fergus! I was fool enough to promise to
                  call and pay her my respects. Do not sneer at your poor master! I was weak, but I
                  will be strong. That promise binds me—I will see her for ten minutes, but first my
                  passage will be taken to Europe—then I will go—I will go—I will leave this cursed
                  soil, and, with the blessing of Heaven, will set my foot upon it no more!"</p>
               <p>"Heaven grant that your lordship may keep your vow!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, be not uneasy; I will keep it." Fergus inclined his head.</p>
               <p>"Your lordship knows one thing—that, whether in Europe or Virginia, he possesses
                  the heart of Fergus, who will live or die with him!"</p>
               <p>On the next morning, Fergus had made all his arrangements: packed all the trunks,
                  paid all his master's accounts, and went to engage their passage in a vessel to
                  sail that very night for England.</p>
               <p>A few moments before, his master had gone to pay his first and last visit to
                  Colonel Brand and his family.</p>
               <p>In three or four hours Fergus came back. The vessel would not sail for four days.
                  His master had not returned; he only reentered his lodgings toward midnight,
                  having dined and spent the evening with Colonel Brand, who was greatly interested
                  in the news from Scotland.</p>
               <p>Fergus shrugged his shoulders, and said nothing. When he announced the delay in
                  the vessel's sailing, Ruthven said, simply, in an absent way:</p>
               <p>"'Tis well, Fergus."</p>
               <p>"I thought to hear ''Tis ill!'" muttered the old servant; "and now,''Tis
                  well!'"</p>
               <p>Colonel Brand had requested Ruthven to call, before his departure, and receive
                  some letters he designed writing to friends in Scotland. The young nobleman
                  accordingly did so—on the very next day—and, as before, remained until late in the
                  evening, conversing this time almost, exclusively with Honoria. When he returned
                  homeward, he might have been heard muttering:</p>
               <p>"And, if Fergus was right in his incredulity!—if I do not go!—'twould be
                  frightful!—fearful! Does Fate drag me? Oh, but I will go!—I will go!—I swear
                  it!"</p>
               <p>As Colonel Brand's letters were not written, it was necessary that Lord Ruthven
                  should repeat his visit. He went thither on the next day—on the next—and, to come
                  to the result, announced finally to Fergus, in a tone of voice impossible to
                  convey to the reader, that he bad changed his resolution: he would not said for
                  Europe.</p>
               <p>Fergus simply bowed his head, suppressing the groan which rose to his lips until
                  his master, left the room. Then he uttered a species of moan, and muttered:</p>
               <p>"Have mercy upon us, O Lord! but may I live and die with my poor master!"</p>
               <p>A month passed. Lord Ruthven and<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6141-00000037"/> Fergus
                  had never again alluded to the projected journey to Europe. The nobleman spent the
                  greater part of his time in his chamber, motionless, in a sort of trance; only,
                  from time to time, he looked, in a singular manner, over his shoulder, as though
                  some frightful object haunted him. His private talks with Fergus had abruptly
                  ceased. At times his eyes would meet those of the old servant, and a glance, full
                  of gloomy meaning, would be exchanged between them. But the pale lips did not
                  open. The old clansman only nodded, uttering deep sighs, intent upon one thing
                  only now—implicit obedience to his chief.</p>
               <p>When a month had passed in this manner, Lord Ruthven, who had grown, if possible,
                  paler and more haggard than before, said one morning to the old servant:</p>
               <p>"Fergus, order my coach."</p>
               <p>Fergus bowed, and went to obey.</p>
               <p>"It has come at last!" he muttered. "The bonny bridegroom is going to his
                  bridal!"</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>XXX. THE TWO RIVALS.</head>
               <p>A MONTH!—a moment, an age; an atom of time, an eternity! A month—in which the
                  idler dawdles through the dull and colorless days, each flying, eventless, in the
                  wake of each; in which, too, the good ship encircles one-half of the world! A
                  month—in which existences fill with sunshine, or are sunk in shadow; in which
                  hearts break, and griefs are assuaged; in which all things come to us, or all
                  things leave us, making us happy or miserable, as the kind Father of all decrees!
                  Fatal days and hours, in which the tide ebbs and flows! I know nothing more
                  remorseless, more paralyzing to the reason, than this certainty of the
                  uncertain—this ignorance of what a day may bring forth!</p>
               <p>This month, over which we have glided, brought Lord Ruthven as a suitor to the
                  feet of Honoria Brand. In spite of every effort which the young nobleman made to
                  tear himself away from her, he gravitated ever nearer, more and more surely; one
                  by one his fears were dissipated, his resolutions undermined and overthrown. He
                  had fallen passionately in love with the little "Brand beauty;" and on this
                  morning was bent upon formally asking her hand of her father.</p>
               <p>Honoria and Innis had witnessed this misfortune with inexpressible agony. So far
                  from becoming indifferent to Edmund, in consequence of the thousand gayeties and
                  distractions which surrounded her, Honoria had felt her affection for the youth
                  increase with every passing hour. With natures like that of this young girl, faith
                  and, constancy are instincts—trial only strengthens them; use brightens and
                  tempers the metal, as fire tests gold. To have Lord Ruthven, therefore, appear as
                  a suitor, was an inexpressible pain to her—to Innis it was almost paralysis. And,
                  worst of all, he could do nothing. What <emph>could</emph> he do? For the youth,
                  almost penniless, to aspire to the hand of the wealthy and beautiful young
                  heiress, was, of itself, sufficiently presumptuous; but, to go to Colonel Brand
                  and say: "I love Honoria, and, for that all-sufficient reason, ask you to refuse
                  the proposed alliance with Lord Ruthven, and give her to me!"—that was little less
                  than insanity. Pride was the master-passion of the colonel—the ambition of seeing
                  his daughter make a great match; and now, when this match was offered, when
                  Honoria could become my Lady Ruthven, the wife of a nobleman, Colonel Brand was to
                  be expected to say, "My daughter cannot wed your lordship. I reserve her for a
                  poor, obscure little cousin of ours!"</p>
               <p>The result was, that Innis was wretched, and Honoria was not happier. She, too,
                  saw the fate coming—could find no ray of hope. All that these young hearts could
                  do, in their unhappy situation, was to love each other more and more, comfort each
                  other with expressions of hope in which they did not believe, and await the
                  intervention of that good Providence which, watching over the sparrows, watches
                  much more over pure hearts, loving and faithful to each other.</p>
               <p>On this morning, when we have heard Lord Ruthven order his coach, Innis and
                  Honoria were conversing in the drawing-room; and the poor youth had spoken of the
                  probable fate to befall them, with mingled pride, suffering, and courage. In the
                  midst of their conversation, a chariot stopped before the door, a knock was heard,
                  and the voice of Lord Ruthven asked for Colonel Brand. The servant was then heard
                  replying that his master was not at home, whereupon Lord Ruthven asked for Miss
                  Honoria, was informed that she was in, and entered the drawing-room.</p>
               <p>As his eyes fell upon the young lady and Innis, Ruthven turned visibly paler, and
                  his agitation was obvious. He, nevertheless, advanced calmly into the apartment,
                  bowed with cordial courtesy, and, offering his hand to Innis, said:</p>
               <p>"I have not had the pleasure of seeing you for some weeks, Mr. Innis."</p>
               <p>Innis returned his salutation with calmness, and said:</p>
               <p>"My books have taken up my attention greatly, my lord; and then I fear you attach
                  little pleasure to our meeting—the first time was unfortunate, and you doubtless
                  owe me a grudge."</p>
               <p>"For my fall? By no means, sir; and I do not regret it, since it gave me the
                  pleasure of your acquaintance."</p>
               <p>There was something sincere and courteous in the voice of Ruthven. His melancholy
                  was ineradicable, but the new influence operating upon his character seemed to
                  have made his disposition more frank and kindly. Innis bowed, and said:</p>
               <p>"Your lordship alludes with great courtesy to what I shall always lament."</p>
               <p>And, having exchanged these polite commonplaces, the gentlemen sat down.</p>
               <p>Honoria's cheeks were burning, and she kept her eyes fixed upon the carpet, scarce
                  raising them as she replied to the commonplace phrases of Lord Ruthven. That
                  gentleman was much too well bred to appear to notice the evident constraint of the
                  young lady's manner; and thus half an hour passed, at the end of which time Lord
                  Ruthven rose, begged that Honoria would present his compliments to the family,
                  bowed, first to the young lady, and then to Innis, and left the house.</p>
               <p>Innis resumed his seat, and for some time gazed in silence upon the floor.</p>
               <p>"There is no longer any room for doubt," he said at length, with the calmness of
                  despair.</p>
               <p>"To doubt, Edmund?" murmured the young girl, faintly.</p>
               <p>"In what character Lord Ruthven comes hither," said Innis; "'tis as a suitor for
                  your hand, Honoria."</p>
               <p>Honoria covered her face with her hands and sobbed. The poor child had no words to
                  reply—she knew that denial was vain.</p>
               <p>"Am I mistaken in so thinking?" said Innis. "You know this, as I do, do you
                  not?"</p>
               <p>"Yes!"</p>
               <p>And a second sob followed the despairing monosyllable.</p>
               <p>"His suit will prosper. You will be—his wife, Honoria! Your father will never
                  permit you to reject a nobleman of his high position! He is worthy of you,
                  too—anger shall not make me unjust. But, worthy or unworthy, the die is cast!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no!. I will never, never consent!" sobbed the girl.</p>
               <p>"How can you resist?" said Innis, in<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6141-00000038"/>
                  despair. "Your father's will is strong enough to break down your own. He will
                  disregard your opposition and declare that you know not what is best for you. In
                  his eyes, you will be but a coy and romantic girl, unable to choose your destiny
                  aright."</p>
               <p>Honoria sobbed out, in a helpless voice:</p>
               <p>"O Edmund, Edmund, he cannot, will not, force me to so miserable a union. Lord
                  Ruthven is a gentleman worthy of esteem; but to marry him would make me wretched,
                  and I will tell papa so! He is not so hard, it may be, as you think him, Edmund.
                  He loves me, and when I tell him that—I love you only—am yours, in the sight of
                  Heaven—that I have no other heart—"</p>
               <p>The poor, faltering voice broke down. In a faint whisper she added:</p>
               <p>"Oh, he will not make me so wretched!"</p>
               <p>Innis shook his head.</p>
               <p>"You do not know what men are made of, my poor darling—they are very hard. The
                  heart is <emph>very</emph> hard when the hair is gray, and the blood cold. They
                  find excellent reasons, then, for separating young hearts—money, position,
                  prudence, is the text of their discourse; and I know not if I should blame
                  them—if, in Colonel Brand's situation, I should act otherwise."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no!—do not speak so! I will never, never become Lady Ruthven!"</p>
               <p>The words seemed to pierce Innis like a weapon, coming thus from Honoria's lips,
                  and his brows were suddenly knit.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Lady Ruthven!</emph> Are you so sure," he said, groaning, "that the
                  difference between plain Mrs. Edmund Innis and my Lady Ruthven will not have some
                  influence on <emph>you</emph> even?"</p>
               <p>"Edmund," she exclaimed, "this is cruel, very cruel in you! 'Tis unworthy of you
                  to so wound a poor girl who is unhappy enough already!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, doubtless 'tis cruel, unworthy; but I am so wretched! How can I see my
                  happiness, more than my life, at stake, and keep my senses? Maidens have lived who
                  have shrunk under this sore temptation—who, when called upon to choose between a
                  poor youth and a wealthy nobleman, have forgotten all but the splendor upon one
                  side and the poverty on the other. But, God keep me from classing <emph>you</emph>
                  with such, Honoria! I am as certain of your faith as I am of my own existence—I
                  know that, if your hand be tied to this gentleman's by a mockery, your heart would
                  not go with it—I know all that, Honoria; I trust you as I would trust an angel—but
                  what is the result for me?—what can I do? All is dark before me!—I can do
                  nothing—"</p>
               <p>Innis bowed his head, and, for a moment, no sound was heard but the sobs of
                  Honoria.</p>
               <p>Suddenly Innis rose erect, and a glance at his face indicated that, in this single
                  instant, he had come to a fixed resolution.</p>
               <p>"Listen, my poor, dear Honoria!—my only hope in life! A man can only fail. When he
                  has done his best, and is crushed, he can still fall with honor, and with some
                  solace in his misery! I will formally ask your father for his daughter's hand.
                  Should he refuse, then—"</p>
               <p>The door opened as Innis was speaking, and Colonel Brand entered the
                  apartment.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>XXXI. THE INTERVIEW.</head>
               <p>COLONEL BRAND was clad in full dress—embroidered coat, gold threaded waistcoat,
                  velvet short-clothes, silk stockings, ruffles, and powder. His air was even more
                  stately than when at Rivanna—his reception by the governor, and the successful
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">début</foreign> of his beautiful daughters, having, in
                  no small degree, heightened his consequence in his own eyes.</p>
               <p>He bestowed a bow, full of stately politeness, upon Innis, and, passing his
                  fingers, after his habitual fashion, between his neck and cravat, with a lofty
                  air, said a few words to Honoria. The young lady replied in a trembling voice;
                  and, finding that her self-possession was leaving her—that, if she remained
                  longer, she would probably burst into tears—abruptly left the apartment.</p>
               <p>Colonel Brand followed her with his eyes—their expression indicating unmistakable
                  astonishment. He turned suddenly to Innis with some <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >hauteur,</foreign> and found that the young man had resumed his seat, thus
                  manifesting a plain intention not to take his departure. The <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">hauteur</foreign> was succeeded by a glance of cold surprise.
                  The colonel sat down in a great arm-chair, and, settling his chin in his ample
                  white cravat, looked at Innis with the air of one who says, "Well, sir, what have
                  you to say to me?"</p>
               <p>The youth courageously returned the haughty glance of his companion—for
                  wretchedness had quite dulled his nerves—and said:</p>
               <p>"I beg a few words with you, sir, upon a matter of great importance to me."</p>
               <p>His voice was calm and measured—the tremor of the tones almost entirely
                  imperceptible.</p>
               <p>"A matter of importance, sir?" said the colonel, coldly inclining his head; "I am
                  at your service."</p>
               <p>"I wish to ask your consent to my marriage with Honoria."</p>
               <p>The words were quickly uttered, but they seemed to have upon Colonel Brand the
                  effect of a blow.</p>
               <p>"Your marriage!—with Honoria!" he gasped, thrown completely from his balance, and
                  losing all his self-possession.</p>
               <p>"With Honoria, sir."</p>
               <p>"Are you mad, sir!" came, in the same gasp of utter astonishment, from the
                  colonel. "What has put so crazy a thought into your mind, sir? It is an utter
                  absurdity—a piece of madness! Your proposal is astounding, sir!—it shocks me
                  beyond words!"</p>
               <p>Innis was silent. With a heightened color and a stern compression of the lips, he
                  braced his strength against the coming storm.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir! I use the proper word—your words shock me! <emph>Marriage</emph>—with
                  my daughter—Honoria! Good Heavens!"</p>
               <p>"I had supposed that you had seen, perhaps, reason to anticipate this request,
                  sir."</p>
               <p>The colonel grew purple—anger began to take the place of astonishment.</p>
               <p>"That I had <emph>seen—seen reason?</emph> Yes sir, I have <emph>seen,</emph> as
                  you have the goodness to word it, your very improper proceedings. But I had not
                  dreamed, sir, that it would come to this—that I should coolly, calmly, without
                  notice, be called upon to consent to the marriage of <emph>Miss Brand</emph> to a
                  person like yourself—to one who—"</p>
               <p>"Stop, sir!" cried Innis suddenly, in a voice as haughty as the colonel, "at least
                  spare me your insults; I am at least a gentleman, and you shall not be under the
                  necessity of asking me out of your house. I will leave it!"</p>
               <p>As Innis spoke, the burning cheeks, the flaming eyes, the lips trembling with
                  sudden ire at the tones of the colonel, showed that the blood of a haughty race in
                  the veins of the youth had taken fire.</p>
               <p>"I am poor—nothing it may be, in your eyes—but I am a gentleman, as you are aware,
                  sir, and, if I am to be insulted, this interview shall here terminate!"</p>
               <p>Innis rose, stern, cold, and erect—a statue of pride—and had made a step toward
                  the door, when the voice of the other arrested him.</p>
               <p>"Sit down, sir," said the colonel, in an agitated voice. "I have more to say to
                  you, and it is far from my design to offer you any insult."</p>
               <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6141-00000039"/>
               <p>The eyes of Innis met those of Colonel Brand, and he read in the latter no longer
                  the contemptuous expression which they had at first worn, rather a gloomy
                  satisfaction at finding opposed to him one as proud and strong as himself, who
                  would not consent to be crushed by a word and a look.</p>
               <p>"I repeat, sir," said the colonel, "that I have no earthly intention of offering
                  you offence—of <emph>insulting</emph> you. Insult you? No, sir. If, under the
                  excitement of the moment—in consequence of this very sudden and unexpected
                  proposition—I have forgotten the courtesies of good society, I beg that you will
                  forgive it, sir, receiving my apologies. I trust that I am too well acquainted
                  with the proprieties of life, and the respect due from one gentleman to another,
                  to offer outrage to one bearing your name; but I repeat also, sir, and I wish to
                  repeat it so plainly that there can be no misunderstanding, that the alliance
                  which you do me the honor to propose is <emph>entirely</emph> out of the
                  question."</p>
               <p>Innis bowed with gloomy courtesy in response to these calmer words, and said:</p>
               <p>"I do not wish to discuss the subject—to interrogate you, sir; but before I
                  terminate this interview, the last in all probability I shall ever have with you,
                  may I beg you to inform me <emph>why</emph> my proposal for Honoria's hand is
                  entirely out of the question?"</p>
               <p>The words as nearly confused Colonel Brand as it was possible for him to be
                  confused. He had no answer ready. It is very easy to exclaim, storm, declare a
                  thing absurd, but difficult sometimes to declare <emph>why</emph> it is absurd.
                  Colonel Brand remained, therefore, for a moment entirely silent, and Innis,
                  catching with the despair of a drowning man at this straw of hope, suddenly said,
                  in his earnest and pathetic voice:</p>
               <p>"Why—I pray you, sir, to tell me—why is my marriage with Honoria impossible? I am
                  a gentleman, her equal, poor, 'tis true, but I have talent, people say, and I love
                  her dearly—with the fondest, the truest devotion—and would make her happy! Why,
                  then is it so <emph>impossible?</emph> I do not ask you to have pity upon my
                  suffering—that is not the tone of a <emph>man</emph>—but I love Honoria so truly!
                  How shall I <emph>live</emph> without her!"</p>
               <p>This passionate cry of love and anguish, bursting through all the wrappings of
                  ceremony, visibly touched the proud but not narrow or sterile mind of the colonel.
                  He was silent, but slowly shook his head, uttering a sort of sigh.</p>
               <p>"My young friend," he said at length, "this painful interview is quite useless,
                  'tis only a suffering to us both. You touch my feelings, but you do not shake my
                  fixed resolve. I have said, and repeat, that your social <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >status</foreign> is not the question—a gentleman is a gentleman under all
                  circumstances, whatever his condition; but your union with Honoria is none the
                  less an impossibility. She is a mere child, and, although I do not say that her
                  age is an insuperable obstacle. 'tis still a serious one. I believe, sir, that you
                  are attached to your cousin. I will not for a single moment do you the gross
                  injustice of believing, much less of saying, that mercenary motives control you. A
                  vulgarian might offer you that insult, sir, and so be rid of your presence; but I,
                  a Virginia gentleman, am incapable of so degrading myself. No, my poor young
                  friend, I am perfectly well assured that you are far above so ignoble a
                  calculation; the question is different, but I am none the less immovable. I regret
                  that my words should cause you so much pain, but believe me, on an occasion like
                  this, plain words are best. I cannot give you my daughter, Mr. Innis. Enough that
                  I am compelled to refuse your request. For yourself personally, sir, I cherish
                  both respect and regard. It is possible that I have not appeared to you a very
                  cordial personage, but my manners ners are naturally reserved, and perhaps pride
                  is one of my defects. If you have thought me without regard, even affection for
                  you, you are mistaken. You will find this fancy dissipated in course of time,
                  perhaps, and do me justice. Now, let us cease to speak upon this very painful
                  subject. The present conversation need not make us strangers henceforth, but I
                  would counsel you as a friend to avoid as far as possible occasions that will
                  serve to nourish a hopeless attachment. I must leave you now, sir; let us part
                  friends. I do not venture, sir, under the circumstances, to make offers to a
                  gentleman of your rank, but, should the occasion present itself, I shall take the
                  liberty of proving myself your friend, begging you not to take offence thereat,
                  but to regard me as your very sincere well-wisher."</p>
               <p>With these words the stately colonel rose, held out his hand to Innis, or rather
                  took that of the youth in his own, pressed it cordially, and with a bow, left the
                  apartment.</p>
               <p>Innis had scarcely returned the grasp of the colonel's hand. His head seemed
                  turning. He slowly took his hat, and went, walking as it were in a dream, to the
                  door, which opened and, closed behind him.</p>
               <p>The clash sent a pang to the lonely heart up-stairs—the girl who, in her chamber,
                  lay sobbing as though her heart were breaking.</p>

               <head>XXXII. DR. VANDYKE'S DISCOVERY.</head>
               <p>INNIS was going along Duke-of-Gloucester Street, walking like a somnambulist,
                  wholly unconscious of the world around him, when suddenly he was arrested by a
                  material obstacle: he had stumbled all at once against another somnambulist, as
                  far away from the real world of Gloucester Street as himself.</p>
               <p>He raised his eyes, and saw that the obstacle was a human being, and this human
                  being Dr. Vandyke.</p>
               <p>The eccentric physician was as strange a spectacle as ever. His squat and powerful
                  form was arrayed as before in the long overcoat whose skirts beat his heels; his
                  feet were encased in enormous buckled shoes, into which descended his old shrunken
                  legs clad in splatter-dashes, and from under his wide hat flowed the long gray
                  elf-locks, framing the thin face, with its sardonic lips, and piercing eyes
                  burning like coals beneath the bushy gray eyebrows.</p>
               <p>"Well met, my young sir!" said Dr. Vandyke, whose countenance was full of joy;
                  "you walk over old friends, it seems, without deigning to notice their
                  existence."</p>
               <p>"Your pardon, doctor," said Innis in a low, hopeless voice; "I was thinking—did
                  not see you—"</p>
               <p>"Thinking?—a villanous habit!—What has youth to do with thinking? Act! enjoy! and
                  leave the rascally <emph>thinking</emph> to the graybeards!"</p>
               <p>There was a species of tonic in the rough, unceremonious voice—commonplace
                  consolation would have disgusted Innis; this man's talk was a stimulant, making
                  him lose sight of his woe. He nodded, therefore; unconsciously permitted the
                  cut-off giant to link an arm in his own, and drag him along with him, and
                  said:</p>
               <p>"So youth is the time of enjoyment, is it? And yet I am young, and I do not
                  enjoy."</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke looked sidewise at him.</p>
               <p>"You do not enjoy?"</p>
               <p>"I do not."</p>
               <p>"A love-disappointment?"</p>
               <p>Innis groaned.</p>
               <p>"Let us not speak of it."</p>
               <p>"So be it," said Dr. Vandyke, "but suffering brings strength. True, I'd<pb
                     n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6141-00000040"/> rather not have strength at that price,
                  and go, even at my age, for enjoyment—which I have at last secured."</p>
               <p>Innis looked at him, and simply nodded.</p>
               <p>"Ah! ah!" chuckled the physician, "you do not comprehend. You don't see how an old
                  mummy like myself can <emph>enjoy.</emph> But I have discovered the <foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">elixir vitaæ.</foreign>"</p>
               <p>And Dr. Vandyke's face grew radiant with joy and pride.</p>
               <p>"The <foreign xml:lang="LAT">elixir vitæ?</foreign>" said Innis.</p>
               <p>"I so style it, since it combats pain, suffering, perhaps death itself."</p>
               <p>The young man gazed at the speaker in astonishment.</p>
               <p>"Your meaning, doctor?"</p>
               <p>"Come with me to my laboratory, and I will show you."</p>
               <p>"To your laboratory?"</p>
               <p>"In the next street. You are disengaged?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Come, then!"</p>
               <p>And with huge strides, his long great-coat flapping against his thin legs, Dr.
                  Vandyke went onward, dragging Innis with him.</p>
               <p>"I have not seen you for some weeks now," he said—"scarcely since my visit to
                  Rivanna."</p>
               <p>"I have lived much retired, engaged in study."</p>
               <p>"One of the joys of life. And the Rivanna family are well? They have brought with
                  them, I see, that strange child Meta, who played so tragic a part in the
                  'dumb-cake' business. I saw her at his excellency's ball looking at you."</p>
               <p>"She is with the family."</p>
               <p>"And still insane?"</p>
               <p>"The word is strong, doctor. She is deaf, dumb, and weak in mind, from an
                  accident—a fall from horseback which drove, it is supposed, a portion of bone into
                  the brain."</p>
               <p>"Ah? But why was no operation ever performed? I mean no surgical operation."</p>
               <p>"The attempt was made, I believe, but the child struggled so violently that 'twas
                  impossible."</p>
               <p>An expression of extreme joy and triumph overspread the countenance of Dr.
                  Vandyke.</p>
               <p>"I was not mistaken, then," he muttered; "but for my grand discovery—"</p>
               <p>He stopped suddenly, and said:</p>
               <p>"When did you last see our friend Lord Ruthven?"</p>
               <p>"This morning."</p>
               <p>The words were forced from the lips, and a suppressed groan came out with them.
                  The marvellously acute ears of the physician caught the sound.</p>
               <p>"Enough—I know all now," he muttered; "they are rivals for the love of my little
                  patient, and it is Ruthven who will win."</p>
               <p>Innis turned his gloomy eyes upon his companion. He had caught the word
                  Ruthven.</p>
               <p>"You are speaking of his lordship?" he said.</p>
               <p>"Was I? Well, this soliloquizing is a bad habit. Ruthven, however, makes one
                  think. Mad—mad as a March hare!"</p>
               <p>"Lord Ruthven?"</p>
               <p>"Himself. Do you doubt it? What else explains his fits and starts—his visions—his
                  terrible look at times as he glances over his shoulder? He is mad—and yet as sane
                  a man too as I ever encountered." The doctor chuckled. "Science tells of such
                  cases," he said.</p>
               <p>"I had not thought thus of his lordship," said Innis. "He is calm, courteous, an
                  official of acknowledged efficiency, I am assured, and, if mad, mad on one subject
                  only."</p>
               <p>"You have hit it. There is one chamber in his brain full of cobwebs, but otherwise
                  vacant—or, if not vacant, inhabited by spectres called Edmund Innis and Honoria
                  Brand."</p>
               <p>Innis started.</p>
               <p>"Your meaning, doctor?"</p>
               <p>"I saw him at the assembly when she entered, and his face wore the same look as on
                  that day when he saw <emph>you</emph> first."</p>
               <p>"Doctor, your penetration is frightful, terrible."</p>
               <p>"Why not? 'Tis my trade—this diagnosis of body and mind. To dismiss Ruthven. He is
                  a mystery still to me, despite my theories—and a mystery from which I anticipate
                  something fearful. But here we are at my house. Come in. I will make
                     <emph>you,</emph> first of all the world, partaker of my triumph!"</p>
               <p>Innis suffered himself to be led by the singular personage up the steps of the
                  small house which we have described in the beginning of this history; a huge key
                  opened the door; and, throwing open another door on the right, the doctor ushered
                  his guest into his study, where a fire was burning—a yellow cat stretched on the
                  rug before it. Dr. Vandyke's first proceeding was to pause and listen.</p>
               <p>"Good!" he then said, with an air of relief. "Snuffers, that venerable female, is
                  reposing on her virtuous couch!—me-thinks I hear the noise of distant thunder,
                  long reverberating, and unmistakably proceeding from her ancient nose! Sweet
                  music!—dulcet harmony! Everybody, friend, is afraid of something or somebody—I am
                  afraid of Snuffers! Her tongue is caustic, her head-dress a nightmare!—but I
                  philosophize! Sit down, my guest; you are in <foreign xml:lang="LAT">domo
                     mea,</foreign>or rather <foreign xml:lang="LAT">tua.</foreign> See, even
                  Felina, my favorite, welcomes us—my cat—though her front-leg has sustained a
                  compound fracture, doubtless the result of night-prowling and the encounter of
                  dogs."</p>
               <p>Felina from her rug uttered a low cry of pain or response. Dr. Vandyke enthroned
                  himself in a great arm-chair; his thin legs spread out; his hands extended toward
                  the blaze; his face joyful.</p>
               <p>"The moment approaches," he said, "when the great arcanum is to be revealed to one
                  of the elect! But I jest in an unseemly manner over so serious a topic. Let me
                  speak gravely."</p>
               <p>The eccentric countenance suddenly lost its joyful and careless expression.</p>
               <p>"I am about to exhibit before you, my young friend," he said, "what will prove one
                  of the greatest and most blessed discoveries which God has ever permitted the
                  poor, narrow brain of humanity to reach. But first let me ask you what is the
                  greatest of human ills?"</p>
               <p>"Despair," said Innis, with an expression of immovable gloom.</p>
               <p>"Suffering, that is to say."</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Of the mind?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"You reply justly; and yet, my young friend, there is reason to question whether
                  the capacity of suffering possessed by the body is not greater than that possessed
                  by the mind. I say that there is a question—I assert positively nothing. But
                  remember the warnings of the Holy Book. The 'wrath to come,' is typified by
                  fire—the continuous burning of the flesh, and the gnawing of a worm upon the
                  vitals. Thus 'tis <emph>bodily</emph> pain that is held up as the chief woe—the
                  utmost penalty."</p>
               <p>"Yes, but—"</p>
               <p>"The soul, you would say, suffers remorse, despair, and these are worst of all. So
                  let it be—let us only say, then, that bodily pain is terrible; that there is
                  reason to doubt whether medicines affect the body as they affect the soul. You are
                  in despair—well, a year afterward you are joyful. You love your wife, your child,
                  your sweetheart, and—you forget them. Time, the great physician, has cured your
                  mental malady, and yet time has not cured yonder victim of consumption, as it did
                  not cure the leper."</p>
               <p>Innis nodded.</p>
               <p>"I understand. You would say<pb n="76 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6141-00000041"/>
                  that there are many anodynes for the soul—fewer for the body."</p>
               <p>"Yes! yes! yes!—Until yesterday."</p>
               <p>"Until yesterday?"</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke seized the cat lying upon the rug.</p>
               <p>"Look at this animal," he said. "She is in pain—is she not?"</p>
               <p>"Doubtless. Her leg is broken, and hanging down. When you only touch it, she
                  utters a cry of suffering."</p>
               <p>"Good!"</p>
               <p>And, filled again with his overflowing joy, Dr. Vandyke took a phial, uncorked it,
                  poured some of the contents of a liquid which it contained upon his handkerchief,
                  and applied it to the mouth of the animal.</p>
               <p>The liquid exhaled a penetrating odor, which seemed as repulsive to the cat as it
                  was to Innis. But Dr. Vandyke continued to press the handkerchief upon the mouth
                  of the animal; gradually its head drooped sidewise, and in a few minutes it
                  exhibited every indication of death.</p>
               <p>"What now!" said the physician, whose face was radiant; "what is the condition of
                  this animal?"</p>
               <p>"I should say that you had poisoned her, doctor—that she is dead."</p>
               <p>"You shall see."</p>
               <p>And, stretching the apparently inanimate form upon the table, Dr. Vandyke opened a
                  drawer and took out a long, sharp instrument, whose point he tried upon his
                  palm.</p>
               <p>"If she is dead," he said, "there can be no harm in probing the wound which she
                  had the misfortune to sustain during her late life—for the benefit of science! I
                  may be called in by some wealthy dowager to set or amputate the leg of her pet
                  Angola: then, my young friend, a knowledge of cat-anatomy may result in
                  guineas."</p>
               <p>The doctor raised the broken leg and felt it.</p>
               <p>"A bad compound fracture," he said, "and scarce such as to admit of setting. She
                  would die of it."</p>
               <p>"Then the cat is not dead?" said Innis, absorbed in spite of himself in the
                  singular proceeding of his companion.</p>
               <p>"Wait, and see."</p>
               <p>And Dr. Vandyke carefully probed the wound, extracting some fragments of bone. The
                  cat did not stir.</p>
               <p>"Useless," he said; "the limb must be amputated."</p>
               <p>And, returning the probe to its drawer, he took out an exceedingly sharp knife, a
                  minute saw, and some thread.</p>
               <p>"Now, for the surgical operation," he exclaimed.</p>
               <p>And, with a sure and rapid hand, he made a circular incision, dividing the flesh
                  to the bone; sawed the bone asunder; threw away the remnant, gathered up and
                  confined the bleeding arteries, and exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"The operation is over!"</p>
               <p>The cat had not moved a muscle, or uttered a sound indicating pain, or even
                  consciousness.</p>
               <p>"What say you now?" cried Dr. Vandyke.</p>
               <p>"I say that it was useless to perform so skilful an operation upon a dead
                  animal."</p>
               <p>"Look!"</p>
               <p>At the same instant the body of the cat was agitated with a species of tremor; the
                  eyes opened, and the animal looked at its master without indications of any pain.
                  Innis gazed at the spectacle with profound astonishment, and then his eyes passed
                  to the face of Dr. Vandyke.</p>
               <p>"I now understand your meaning," he said; "you have discovered the antidote to
                     <emph>pain.</emph> You are immortal!"</p>
               <p>"If some other human being does not secure the fame of my discovery. I have found

                     remembered that ether was known to the alchemists, and that the method of
                     making it was described by Valerius Cordus in 1540. It is also to be considered
                     that physicians long sought for some means of benumbing the nerves of sensation
                     during surgical operations, and that in the last century their attention was
                     particularly turned to ether. which Dr. Frobinius first brought into general
                     notice by a paper in the "Philosophical Transactions" of 1730. There is,
                     therefore, really no improbability in supposing that an able and inventive
                     student of chemistry and medicine like Dr. Vandyke may have anticipated in his
                     solitary researches the discovery of Morton, and that the memory of his success
                     may have been lost in the confusion of the Revolution, which was then close at

               <p>A species of furious triumph possessed the eccentric personage. He gesticulated,
                  strode about the room, and seemed wild with joy and triumph. Suddenly he
                  stopped.</p>
               <p>"You now know, do you not, friend, why I asked you the condition of the young girl
                  Meta?"</p>
               <p>"Of Meta, doctor?"</p>
               <p>"She has had a fall from horseback; it has paralyzed alike brain, and tongue, and
                  hearing, for a fragment of bone has impinged upon the brain, and this little
                  fragment has dethroned language, and reason and education, since education is
                  through the ear. This poor creature is thus a pagan and a lunatic. No operation
                  can be performed, from the wild struggling with which she resists it. Well, see
                  that small phial!—with one-fourth of its contents, I paralyze, in my turn, this
                  rebellious bundle of nerves—I cut with the knife and saw into the child's very
                  brain, and she feels no pain! I remove the obstacle to the action of her
                  reason—she hears, speaks, thinks, is taught—I have performed—I, the poor worm—what

               <p>An hour afterward Innis was returning to his lodging, full of an astonishment

               <head>XXXIII. THE RING.</head>
               <p>ANOTHER month had passed. It was one of those nights of winter when the world
                  seems to have bid farewell forever to warmth and sunshine; when the wind groans
                  drearily around the houses and through leafless trees, and the moon, drifting
                  through long surges of black cloud, only adds with its funereal and flitting beams
                  to the hopeless desolation of the face of the world.</p>
               <p>Innis traversed the deserted streets of Williamsburg, slowly advancing toward the
                  residence of Honoria. He had been summoned by her, after a long separation caused
                  by the serious illness of the young lady; he was ignorant of the object of this
                  long-deferred interview; but something whispered to him that it had some
                  connection with the continuous visits of Lord Ruthven, and the dreary expression
                  of the pale and haggard face indicated the nature of his anticipations.</p>
               <p>He entered the house, not noticing that the old family servant, who opened the
                  door, looked at him with deep commiseration<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6141-00000043"
                  /> miseration. Honoria was seated alone, before the fire in the drawing-room, and
                  a susceptible tremor agitated her frame as he entered. Innis started. The girl was
                  no longer any thing but the shadow of herself. She was fearfully thin and pale,
                  and the eyes, dim and sunken, were full of a strange apathy. With her long,
                  flowing robe fitting but loosely now to her slender figure, she resembled a ghost.
                  She was motionless, except that, from moment to moment, she turned backward and
                  forward with her thin fingers a ring upon the third finger of her left hand.</p>
               <p>As Innis approached, she slowly turned her head and looked at him. The appearance
                  of the haggard face, and the apathetic eyes surrounded by red rings, made him
                  shudder.</p>
               <p>"I—sent for you," she said, in a faint, low voice, with something dreary and
                  hopeless in its accent; "I wished to see you—once at least—before—"</p>
               <p>The voice faltered and died away.</p>
               <p>"Before—my marriage," she added, in a sort of whisper.</p>
               <p>Innis shook from head to foot, and drew a long breath through his set teeth.</p>
               <p>"Your marriage?" he said, convulsively.</p>
               <p>"My marriage."</p>
               <p>The apathy had extended to the voice now. Honoria looked at him, and added:</p>
               <p>"Then you did not know that I was to be married?"</p>
               <p>The young man suddenly lost all self-command, and cried:</p>
               <p>"O my God! Honoria! Do not say that! Do not look at me so! I shall go mad!"</p>
               <p>"And I too, Edmund, if I am not so already."</p>
               <p>The slow, measured accents had not changed; the young lady was evidently the
                  victim of utter despair, and her nerves were paralyzed.</p>
               <p>"Do you think," she went on, "that I too have had no reason to go mad? My father
                  has betrothed me to Lord Ruthven, despite my tears, and prayers for mercy—only
                  mercy! Nothing moves him. He acts for my good, he says. I will thank him some
                  day—girls do not know their minds—another opportunity for so great a match may
                  never again occur—I must abandon my school-girl fancies—I must marry this
                  nobleman!"</p>
               <p>"You cannot—shall not?" Innis suddenly cried; "it would be monstrous!"</p>
               <p>"It will be monstrous."</p>
               <p>"Will be!"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"You will marry this man?"</p>
               <p>"I must!"</p>
               <p>Innis fell into a chair, covering his face with his hands. All his manhood had
                  succumbed.</p>
               <p>"Oh, you cannot, you cannot!" he cried; "it will kill me!"</p>
               <p>"We shall then be together again," came in a low, solemn voice from the girl.</p>
               <p>Innis raised his head and looked at her with fiery eyes, full of blinding
                  tears.</p>
               <p>"Do you think," said Honoria, slowly and calmly, "that I am stronger than you—that
                  I can live through this degradation, this lie of promising love to
                     <emph>him</emph> when I love—<emph>you</emph>—you only in this world? I have
                  submitted to the will of my father, and have not sunk under my sufferings—I have
                  been very ill, but have grown well again, as you see. Soon I shall be ill a second
                  time, and then I shall not recover. Nor would I. Once I shrunk from death—now I
                  long for it, and pray God to send it me, as His dearest blessing."</p>
               <p>Innis fell upon his knees before her, seizing the poor, thin hands.</p>
               <p>"Oh, do not speak of death, my own Honoria!" he cried. "Live for <emph>me,</emph>
                  your poor, poor Edmund!—refuse to sell yourself thus, in this hateful, this
                  horrible union! Your father is cruel—leave him! Come with me, and be what you are
                  in the sight of Heaven, my dear wife!"</p>
               <p>Honoria slowly shook her head.</p>
               <p>"Such unions are not happy. Obedience to parents is commanded by a greater power
                  than any upon earth. Do not urge me, Edmund—there is no hope—no! Do not let us
                  even speak of that! Death alone can free me from this frightful fate. I have sent
                  for you, to tell you that I shall die soon—to say farewell—and—"</p>
               <p>With a convulsive movement, she drew the ring from her thin finger, held it out to
                  Innis, and, turning away her head, whispered:</p>
               <p>"And to return you this."</p>
               <p>The effort exhausted her strength, but unsealed the blessed fountain of tears. She
                  burst into passionate sobs, let her face fall hopelessly upon the wet face of the
                  youth at her feet, and exclaiming—"This is killing me, Edmund!" fainted in his
                  arms.</p>
               <p>A quarter of an hour afterward, Honoria was in her chamber, clasped, almost
                  lifeless, in the arms of her sister; and Innis was walking the street with wild
                  and uncertain steps—a hopeless man in the dreary winter-night.</p>

               <head>XXXIV. PHIL CARY FINDS THE MOMENT.</head>
               <p>IT was the morning succeeding this scene, full of passionate anguish. In the same
                  chair which had been occupied by Honoria in the drawing-room, sat her sister Lou,
                  bending down and weeping.</p>
               <p>"I cannot endure it! Oh, I cannot endure the thought!" she sobbed out. "It will
                  kill Honoria! What is to become of us? Oh, what is to become of us?"</p>
               <p>The hands which had covered her beautiful face fell, and her eyes were seen bathed
                  in tears which flowed silently down the flushed cheeks. She gazed for some moments
                  fixedly upon the floor; uttered a moan; and, rising to the full height of her
                  superb figure, leaned for support—for she felt weak and faint—against the carven
                  wood-work of the tall mantel-piece.</p>
               <p>Such was her preoccupation that she did not hear the door open, or see a personage
                  who stopped upon the threshold.</p>
               <p>"Oh, this place is hateful, hateful!" she exclaimed. "Why did we ever come hither,
                  and Honoria meet this person? If I could only fly from this town—never to return!
                  Oh, who will take me?"</p>
               <p>"I, Lou," said a voice behind her, and turning quickly she saw Phil Cary, smiling,
                  with a frank light in his blue eyes, standing in the door-way.</p>
               <p>"You!" she exclaimed; "I did not know that you were within a hundred miles,
                  sir!"</p>
               <p>Phil Cary's face had been full of happy smiles. Now he blushed suddenly, and a
                  gloomy expression replaced the sunshine.</p>
               <p>"So the capital has made you formal!" he said.</p>
               <p>"Formal!—me?"</p>
               <p>"You no longer call me <emph>Phil</emph> as at Rivanna—then you have forgotten me,
                  or grown cold to me?"</p>
               <p>Miss Lou Brand blushed unmistakably in her turn.</p>
               <p>"Cold?—no! you are so unjust!—why should you think—!" There she stopped.</p>
               <p>There seemed little reason for so much embarrassment, or for such careful
                  avoidance of her visitor's eye. What could be the matter with the witty and
                  satirical Miss Brand?</p>
               <p>The young man became more and more gloomy; but it was easy to see that with this
                  gloom mingled a passionate sentiment of some description.</p>
               <p>"I thought you would have met me with a little more cordiality, Lou," he said.
                  "But pardon me—doubtless 'tis<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6141-00000044"/>
                  disagreeable to you to have such liberties taken."</p>
               <p>"Liberties!" murmured the young lady, carefully not looking at him.</p>
               <p>"The liberty of calling you by your old name. I will not further offend."</p>
               <p>"Oh no! no!—do not call me otherwise; do not be formal with me, Philip."</p>
               <p>A roseate flush spread itself over the beautiful face.</p>
               <p>"I am so unhappy!" she added, with a suppressed sob.</p>
               <p>"Very unhappy?"</p>
               <p>The impetuous youth drew the hand which he held in his own toward him. The owner
                  did not seem to observe the circumstance, or the fact that her companion was
                  gazing into her averted face with passionate tenderness.</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, yes!" she murmured; "this town is hateful to me! Why should I conceal my
                  feelings, or hide our family trouble from <emph>you?</emph> Honoria is to marry my
                  Lord Ruthven!—think of it! He is odious to her—or, if not odious,
                     <emph>indifferent</emph>—and she, you know, she loves Edmund with her very
                  heart of hearts! Oh, 'tis frightful! Can Heaven smile upon a union so repulsive?
                  To give the hand to one when the heart is another's—to be <emph>driven</emph> to a
                  marriage from which you shrink with a shudder of disgust! And yet, 'tis fated to
                  be thus—our father is immovable. Last night Edmund bade farewell forever to
                  Honoria, and the poor, poor thing fainted in his arms—where she belongs—where she
                  belongs!"</p>
               <p>And the warm-hearted girl burst into passionate tears. Before she was aware of it,
                  she was sobbing upon her old playmate's shoulder; he was speaking to her in
                  hurried, passionate words of love and comfort; and, a, quarter of an hour
                  afterward, the young man, in a moment, as it were, and ignorant almost how it came
                  about, had avowed his own love, and was the girl's accepted lover.</p>
               <p>These things thus happen.—They had lived all their lives together, jested,
                  laughed, teased each other daily—not knowing that, amid all that mirth and
                  carelessness, they were gradually approaching the moment when they would
                     <emph>love</emph> each other! This instant of passionate anguish had decided
                  their destinies. The beautiful young girl was sobbing, suffering, looking around
                  her for some one to comfort her, and Fate brought her playmate—loved more than she
                  herself dreamed. He had spoken, and the throbbing hearts beat close, each pressed
                  to each, in a long, lingering embrace.</p>
               <p>An hour afterward, Miss Lou Brand, blushing in an angelic manner, and smiling
                  through her tears like an April morning, whispered, faintly:</p>
               <p>"But, your mother, Philip? She does not wish you to marry anybody, you know. Are
                  you sure—do you think she will—have <emph>me?</emph>"</p>
               <p>The reply of Mr. Phil Cary to this question was of a peculiar character; but
                  neither his words nor his actions will be here recorded. In due time he succeeded
                  in expressing himself intelligibly, and informing the young lady that his
                  excellent mother had been quite ill; that she longed for a daughter-in-law to
                  cheer her loneliness; and he further assured his companion that Mrs. Cary had
                  ended their last discussion by warmly urging her son to pay his addresses to Lou
                  Brand.</p>
               <p>"Then—"</p>
               <p>The young lady uttered that single word, blushing radiantly as she, did so, and
                  glancing side wise for the hundredth part of a second at her lover.</p>
               <p>"Don't, Philip!" came from her a moment afterward; and, as the description of this
                  scene has proceeded to sufficient length, we now close the door, and discreetly
                  retire.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>XXXV. A STRANGE COMFORTER.</head>
               <p>TO return, for a moment, to the preceding night. Innis had walked the street
                  wildly for an hour after his interview with Honoria. Then, without consciousness
                  of the fact, he bent his way toward his lodgings, entered, ascended the narrow
                  stairs, and found himself in his chamber, where the dying embers scarce revealed
                  the outlines of the furniture.</p>
               <p>He fell into a seat, uttered a groan, and covered his face with his hands.</p>
               <p>"I was sure of it!" muttered a voice on the opposite side of the fireplace. "Who
                  will say hereafter that penetration is not one of my qualities!"</p>
               <p>Innis started, and looked in the direction of the voice.</p>
               <p>"Oh, it's only your friend Vandyke," said the eccentric, who was sprawled as usual
                  in a capacious chair. "I have only been awaiting you an hour and a half. Your old
                  servant told me where you had gone, and I knew what the result of your visit would
                  be. So the bonny bird is going to flit from you at last?"</p>
               <p>"Spare me!" groaned Innis. "I am wellhigh heart-broken, and cannot speak of
                  this."</p>
               <p>"Let us speak of something else, then. Have you seen Meta?"</p>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>"She is cured."</p>
               <p>And the doctor kicked together the brands in the fireplace with his huge foot, and
                  produced a blaze.</p>
               <p>"Let us talk a little by firelight—'tis the best to talk by," he said, composedly.
                  "Yes, Meta is cured."</p>
               <p>"You have not performed—"</p>
               <p>"My operation? Yes. Three weeks since—without difficulty, without pain!—and the
                  child is convalescent—more, <emph>sane!</emph> SANE! SANE—I tell you!"</p>
               <p>As he uttered the words, "sane, sane, sane," Dr. Vandyke's voice rose steadily in
                  loud and sonorous accents, until the latter word was nearly shouted aloud.</p>
               <p>"Yes, my young friend," he added, "after our last interview I sought Colonel Brand
                  and Lady Brand immediately—proposed to perform the operation—conquered their
                  scruples—administered my <foreign xml:lang="LAT">elixir vitæ</foreign> to the
                  child—removed the fragment of bone thrust by her fall upon her brain; and now she
                  smiles, hears, understands, and babbles!—babbles, I say, for speech slowly
                  returns. But, it will return—nay, it has!—and you will find as much."</p>
               <p>The words were uttered with a strange, wistful, mysterious significance. One would
                  have said that this man was in possession of some secret which he longed to
                  reveal, but was prevented by circumstances from disclosing.</p>
               <p>In a moment, Innis lost sight of his own misfortunes, thinking of Meta.</p>
               <p>"Cured—sane!" he said; "is it possible, sir? I confess I had no faith in any such
                  miracle."</p>
               <p>"There are no miracles," said Dr. Vandyke, "save those of the Holy Scriptures. A
                  miracle is the violation by the Supreme Law-giver of His own law—as when Lazarus
                  rose at the command of the Son of God. Else the seasons, the course of the stars,
                  the growth of the acorn, were miracles. Nor is this cure of a poor human being,
                  under the scalpel, more of a miracle than these. The obstacle to the operation was
                  there, and was removed. Science moves and acts under the fiat of the Supreme
                  Power. The child is sane—she laughs and weeps, and I heard her praying!"—the words
                  were uttered proudly, triumphantly—"and without pain!" added the physician.</p>
               <p>"Absolutely?" said Innis.</p>
               <p>"She did not move! When the operation was over, she murmured, in a low voice,
                  'That is my oriole singing in the tree!'"</p>
               <p>Innis listened with astonishment.</p>
               <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6141-00000045"/>
               <p>"And she speaks distinctly?"</p>
               <p>"Not perfectly. Long disuse of the lingual muscles is the only obstacle. And now
                  that I have told you of Meta, tell me of yourself."</p>
               <p>"I have naught to tell you, doctor," said Innis, in a voice of utter despair.
                  "Your words, a few moments since, indicated a knowledge of my most private
                  affairs—of my very great distress—spare me, then, the grief of referring to
                  it."</p>
               <p>"So be it," said he; "but will you receive advice from a very old man, who has
                  suffered much?"</p>
               <p>"Advice?"</p>
               <p>"Counsel, based upon experience."</p>
               <p>"Most willingly."</p>
               <p>"Then I sum up my advice to you in a single word—wait."</p>
               <p>"Wait, for what?"</p>
               <p>"For that which the future will bring forth. I do not say that it will bring forth
                  happiness—it may produce misery. But—wait. Take no trouble on trust. The cloud is
                  dark often when the sun is about to shine. There are no miracles, but there are
                  strange events in the histories of human lives; and 'twas to say this that I came
                  to-night, through cold and storm—and I was going to wait, if necessary until
                  daylight, for your return."</p>
               <p>Having uttered these mysterious words, the physician seized Innis's hand, squeezed
                  it with the force of a giant, dashed his hat upon his head, and disappeared from
                  the apartment.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>XXXVI. THE FAMILY IN CONCLAVE.</head>
               <p>INNIS was seated before the fire in his chamber, on the second day after these
                  scenes, gazing with dull and stupefied eyes into the blaze, when a knock came at
                  his door, and the old butler of Colonel Brand entered, bowing respectfully.</p>
               <p>The young man returned his greeting, in a dreary way, and said:</p>
               <p>"Well, Robin?"</p>
               <p>"A note from master, Mas' Edmund."</p>
               <p>And the old gray-haired servant went to a table, took a small waiter therefrom,
                  deposited the note upon it, and respectfully presented it to Innis. He took it
                  with a strange expression of mingled repugnance and surprise, and, tearing it
                  open, read the following lines:</p>

                              the hour of noon and one o'clock to-day? An affair of a very
                              extraordinary character renders your presence desirable, and I beg
                              that you will not fail to be present at the hour named.</p>
                           <p>"I have the honor to be</p>

               <p>The young man read this note over twice, with indications of very great
                  astonishment, and muttered, "An affair of an extraordinary character."</p>
               <p>A slight movement made by old Robin recalled the fact of his presence. It was
                  necessary to reply to the colonel's note; and Innis wrote a line to him, informing
                  him that he would be present at the hour indicated. This note he handed to old
                  Robin. That old colored gentleman—for gentleman Robin was in his character and
                  feelings—carefully placed the missive in his pocket, fell back a step,
                  and—waited.</p>
               <p>Innis looked at him.</p>
               <p>"You have something to say to me, Robin?"</p>
               <p>"I thought, Mas' Edmund," said Robin, "you might have something to say to
                     <emph>me.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, I understand you, Robin! Thanks, thanks, my good friend. Your Miss
                  Honoria—"</p>
               <p>"She is better to-day, sir."</p>
               <p>Innis sighed deeply, and his head sank. His eyes were fixed upon the fire, his
                  expression absent and dreamy, and, taking this as an indication that his presence
                  was no longer desired, old Robin silently and respectfully left the apartment.</p>
               <p>The young man continued for some time lost in reverie.</p>
               <p>"What now!" he muttered at length. "Here is a mystery which at other times would
                  certainly interest me! 'An affair of an extraordinary character'—what may that be?
                  That my Lord Ruthven is an impostor—I a changeling, and the true representative of
                  the earldom? What means this most mysterious mystery? Ah! well—all speculation is
                  idle, doubtless. I shall very soon see."</p>
               <p>And, relapsing into reverie, the young man continued to gaze with his old
                  expression into the blaze.</p>
               <p>At noon precisely, Innis presented himself at Colonel Brand's door, and had no
                  necessity to ask for the master of the mansion, who stood upon the threshold of
                  the great drawing-room, waiting to receive him.</p>
               <p>It was obvious, from the appearance of the colonel's face, that some surprising
                  event had occurred. A sudden alteration had taken place in him. The countenance,
                  ordinarily so flushed and rubicund with high living and rich wines, was pale and
                  haggard; the air of proud, almost haughty politeness, not unmingled with
                  condescension, had given place to a bearing full of absent-mindedness and gloom;
                  the erect figure was bent; the shoulders stooped, and the unwonted negligence of
                  the colonel's toilet betrayed the absorbing character of the thoughts which
                  occupied him.</p>
               <p>Innis advanced with slow and measured steps, and made a low and ceremonious
                  bow.</p>
               <p>"I have come in response to your request, this morning, sir," he said, coldly.</p>
               <p>"I thank you, sir," said the colonel, in a much-altered, and singularly faltering
                  voice.</p>
               <p>He almost instantly recovered, however, his self-possession, and, with something
                  of his old stateliness, bowed low, and said:</p>
               <p>"I pray you to come into the drawing-room, Mr. Innis. I desire to communicate to
                  you a matter of very great importance."</p>
               <p>The last words were uttered with a quick tremor, of which the colonel tried vainly
                  to divest his voice. As he spoke, he stood ceremoniously aside, that Innis might
                  precede him; and the young man, inclining slightly in response to this courtesy,
                  entered the apartment.</p>
               <p>Near a table, on the right of the fireplace, sat Lady Brand, holding in her own
                  the thin hand of Honoria, who, pale, anxious, and with eyes which never wandered
                  from Innis, seemed occupied by some absorbing emotion. Within a few feet Lou Brand
                  stood erect, her superb figure drawn up to its full height, her jewelled hand
                  resting upon the carved back of an arm-chair, and in this chair reclined Meta,
                  looking very white and much reduced, but with an unwonted expression of calmness
                  and sweetness in her dark eyes, around which fell a few stray curls of her black
                  hair.</p>
               <p>We have heard Dr. Vandyke explain to Innis the daring attempt made to restore
                  Meta, and its perfectly successful result. It is unnecessary to dwell further upon
                  the scene. The all-powerful anæsthetic had done its work, and plunged the child
                  into coma—the rapid and unerring hand had removed the obstruction to
                  reason—painlessly removed it even; and the human being, but lately a subtle,
                  scheming, insane girl, tongue-tied, and deaf as dumb, was in possession of her
                  reason, in possession of the power of hearing and of speaking—smiled, as those
                  around her had not seen her smile for years, and thrilled with<pb n="84-85"
                     xml:id="VAC6141-00000046"/> happiness when informed of this miracle wellnigh,
                  which had restored to her the light of reason, and opened the blessed fountain of
                  tears.</p>
               <p>As he slowly advanced into the apartment, Innis surveyed with a fixed glance the
                  group near the fireplace, suppressing with difficulty his agitation at the sight
                  of Honoria. As he drew near, the countenance of the young girl flushed slowly; her
                  lips trembled, and her thin hand convulsively grasped the hand of Lady Brand,
                  whose eyes were swimming in tears.</p>
               <p>Before Innis could speak, Colonel Brand advanced, and said in a voice which he
                  vainly endeavored to control:</p>
               <p>"You will perceive, sir, that I have invited you to something which resembles a
                  family consultation. You see here assembled all the members of my family, as it is
                  my wish that all should be present and participate in this interview."</p>
               <p>Innis bowed, but said nothing. He felt that his voice would fail him.</p>
               <p>Colonel Brand cleared his throat, and drew himself up with a painful assumption of
                  dignity.</p>
               <p>"The object of this interview, sir, is to inform you of a very unexpected
                  discovery."</p>
               <p>A suppressed sigh from Lady Brand was heard as the colonel ended his sentence, and
                  the sound seemed to irritate him.</p>
               <p>"I pray you do not permit any evidence of emotion, madam, to mingle with this
                  strictly, business consultation. You will perceive that I, madam, am not agitated
                  in the least."</p>
               <p>And Colonel Brand's voice shook.</p>
               <p>Innis looked at Lady Brand, and saw that she was nearly ready to sob. The
                  spectacle broke down his haughty pride, and he exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"What is the occasion of this agitation, aunt? Speak! I am lost in wonder at this
                  scene. What is the occasion of your grief?"</p>
               <p>"It is not grief, sir!" said Colonel Brand, with <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >hauteur.</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>"What then?" said Innis.</p>
               <p>"Agitation—mere agitation, sir! Ladies do not understand business."</p>
               <p>"The cause of this agitation, then, if it be agitation alone?"</p>
               <p>Innis spoke with vehemence, a vague excitement mastering him.</p>
               <p>"The reply is simple, sir," said Colonel Brand. "Yesterday I and my family were
                  persons of wealth and consequence—to-day we are stripped of all, and are
                  penniless."</p>
               <p>Innis looked at the speaker with stupefaction.</p>
               <p>"You speak in riddles, sir. I pray you will explain yourself."</p>
               <p>"That is easy, sir. I am no longer the proprietor of Rivanna!"</p>
               <p>"Good Heavens!—and who—"</p>
               <p>"Is the owner of the estate? It is yourself, sir."</p>
               <p>"I!" exclaimed Innis. "I the owner of Rivanna!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir; and I beg to say that I shall in no manner contest your claim. The
                  entire estate will be surrendered to you, so soon as I shall have been able to
                  secure shelter for my family."</p>
               <p>Innis uttered no word of reply. His eyes were riveted upon the face of Colonel
                  Brand with an expression of incredulous astonishment.</p>
               <p>"I shall be compelled, for a brief space, to remain a trespasser upon your
                  property, sir," said the colonel, in an agitated voice. "I shall proceed at once
                  to collect my scattered resources, and shall be able, I trust, to secure a
                  moderate provision for my household—an honorable support for them—the rest I leave
                  to Providence."</p>
               <p>"In Heaven's name, end this preface, sir, and explain what you mean!" exclaimed
                  Innis.</p>
               <p>"It is easily explained," muttered Colonel Brand. But there he stopped.</p>
               <p>"The explanation!" said Innis, gloomily. "So many things have occurred recently,
                  sir, that I am proof against almost all emotion. You, nevertheless, excite my
                  curiosity."</p>
               <p>"Without further delay, then, you are, as I have said, the sole proprietor of the
                  Rivanna estate. Your indulgence, sir! I did not think to betray this agitation,
                  but the thought is bitter that Ellen—I mean Lady Brand—and my children—my dear
                  children—"</p>
               <p>The haughty spirit broke down. The voice stuck in the throat.</p>
               <p>At the same moment a chariot was heard to stop before the door; the knocker rose
                  and fell.</p>
               <p>"Lord Ruthven!" old Robin announced.</p>
               <p>"It is well!" muttered Colonel Brand; "the family party is now complete, and one
                  explanation will suffice for everybody."</p>
               <p>As he uttered these words, Lord Ruthven, who had paused for a moment in the hall
                  to divest himself of his furs, entered the apartment, and saluted the assembled
                  company with a profound and courtly inclination.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>XXXVII. THE EXPLANATION.</head>
               <p>RUTHVEN surveyed the gathering before him with unmistakable curiosity and
                  astonishment; but, suppressing immediately all indications of surprise, said to
                  Colonel Brand in his grave and courtly voice:</p>
               <p>"I received your note, sir, and trust that I have not compelled you to await
                  me."</p>
               <p>As he spoke he drew from his breast his watch, and added, after looking at it:</p>
               <p>"I am glad to find that I am punctual, having just the hour mentioned in your
                  note."</p>
               <p>Colonel Brand bowed.</p>
               <p>"Strict punctuality was immaterial, my lord," was his ceremonious reply; "and Mr.
                  Innis, a necessary personage in this family meeting, has just arrived."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Innis?" said Ruthven, turning his head. He spoke almost unconsciously, but
                  was quickly aware of the unceremonious character of his words, and added:</p>
               <p>"I beg that Mr. Innis will pardon the apparent discourtesy of my question. I had
                  forgotten that he is a close and valued member of your family, sir."</p>
               <p>Colonel Brand inclined his head, preserving his cold, almost stiff air of
                  ceremony.</p>
               <p>"It was absolutely necessary, as you will ere long become aware, that Mr. Innis
                  should attend at this very painful interview," he said, "and should have his part
                  in what is to take place."</p>
               <p>Ruthven again bowed, and said:</p>
               <p>"Certainly, sir; but may I venture to say that Lady Brand and Miss Brand appear
                  unwell and agitated? Is their presence necessary?"</p>
               <p>"Absolutely necessary."</p>
               <p>"Then this is a family consultation?"</p>
               <p>"A family meeting, at all events, my lord; and, though I shall speak for my wife
                  and daughters, it is their own desire to be present when I do so."</p>
               <p>"That terminates the discussion, sir; pray pardon the seeming intrusion of my
                  advice. I had feared that a business discussion would perhaps embarrass or annoy
                  the ladies. As it is not so, their presence is a satisfaction to me. I derive too
                  much pleasure from the society of those toward whom I hope even to sustain more
                  intimate relations."</p>
               <p>Colonel Brand was silent. It was easy to see that he was greatly agitated. His
                  face was pale, and his breathing labored. He looked around him, found<pb n="86-87"
                     xml:id="VAC6141-00000047"/> that every one was waiting, and at length said:</p>
               <p>"I see that you expect me to speak, gentlemen, and I can no longer delay my very
                  painful communication.—Lord Ruthven, yesterday I was a gentleman of large landed
                  estate, living in affluence and luxury: to-day I am wellnigh penniless—nearly a
                  beggar! A moment, my lord: your astonishment is natural, but I beg that you will
                  withhold it until I have terminated my necessary explanation. I shall proceed to
                  put yourself and Mr. Innis, who is equally ignorant, in possession of the facts,
                  and inform you of the unexpected manner in which I became aware of the real
                  situation of affairs."</p>
               <p>The ladies had not moved. Lady Brand continued to hold Honoria's hand—her sister
                  to lean composedly upon the back of Meta's chair. Innis and Ruthven alone
                  exhibited curiosity and astonishment.</p>
               <p>"I shall address myself to you, my lord," continued Colonel Brand, in an agitated
                  voice, "as Mr. Innis is more or less familiar with the subject of which I shall
                  speak. The estate of 'Rivanna,' upon which I live, and which is justly regarded as
                  one of the most princely in the colony, was formerly the property of Colonel
                  Seaton, a gentleman of many accomplishments and very high character. He was never
                  married, and, to dissipate his loneliness, he adopted two nieces, cousins, who
                  were greatly beloved by him, and stood to him in the relation of children. Of
                  these, it was supposed that the elder niece was the favorite; but, on the death of
                  Colonel Seaton, it was ascertained that he had devised his estate of Rivanna to
                  the younger, my wife, leaving an inconsiderable estate to the elder. The origin of
                  this disproportion was never accurately ascertained. It could only be conjectured
                  that the elder young lady, who was very impulsive and high-spirited, had had some
                  misunderstanding with her uncle, and that he had punished her by bestowing the
                  bulk of his property upon her cousin. Something was said of Colonel Seaton's
                  disapproval of a preferred suitor of the elder young lady. But these points are
                  not important. Colonel Seaton died, leaving Rivanna to his younger niece. The
                  elder married Mr. Innis, of 'Lodore,' and died, leaving an only child, Mr. Edmund
                  Innis, now present. My marriage had taken place some months before, and, in right
                  of my wife, I became the proprietor of the estate of Rivanna. This estate now
                  passes to the representative of the elder niece of Colonel Seaton, Mr. Edmund
                  Innis."</p>
               <p>Colonel Brand turned, and bowed with formal ceremony to the young man, who gazed
                  at him in silent astonishment, and seemed to regard the whole scene as a
                  dream.</p>
               <p>"The ground of Mr. Innis's claim to the estate," continued Colonel Brand, "or,
                  rather, the title by which he holds it from this moment, is derived from a later
                  will of Colonel Seaton's, only recently discovered by a member of my family. This
                  will entirely annuls the first—is indisputable, and perfectly regular and
                  formal—if it were not, the intent of the testator is so clearly expressed, in his
                  own writing, that I should not oppose for a moment the effect of the
                  instrument."</p>
               <p>Innis let his head fall, and uttered a deep sigh. Then, a flash of the eye
                  indicated that some sudden thought had passed through his mind. He said nothing,
                  however, and Colonel Brand continued:</p>
               <p>"The will of Colonel Seaton was discovered in an extraordinary manner. During the
                  last autumn, a party of young ladies, then on a visit to Rivanna, determined to
                  indulge in the very absurd and superstitious ceremony of 'eating the dumb-cake,'
                  as it is called—some highly-objectionable mummery, connected with procuring
                  buckets of water from a particular ticular locality, looking into a mirror at
                  midnight, and other folly. Not to dwell further upon this unfortunate incident
                  than is necessary, Honoria was selected to undergo the trial. And this poor
                  child"—he pointed, as he spoke, to Meta—"who had then the misfortune to labor
                  under mental infirmity, determined to frighten her cousin. She accordingly went to
                  Honoria's chamber, and—as she has revealed to us since her happy restoration to
                  health—sought for a place of concealment. There were no closets, but in one corner
                  stood an old linen-chest which had not been opened for years. The key had been
                  long lost; but Meta, in her solitary explorations of garrets and dark closets, had
                  discovered the key—a large and peculiar one—and succeeded in opening the chest,
                  which she designed using as a hiding-place. This she, however, found to be
                  impossible. The chest was filled with nondescript articles—old worn-out clothes,
                  papers, and other things. She accordingly abandoned the idea of hiding there—took
                  her place behind the curtains of the bed, and, on her cousin's entry, succeeded,
                  in a manner it is needless to dwell upon, in very seriously and almost fatally
                  frightening Honoria. Not further to dwell upon this very unpleasant incident—Meta,
                  after her cousin's recovery, returned to pry into the chest, and carried off many
                  articles to store away in private receptacles—among others, this paper"—Colonel
                  Brand drew from his breast a folded document, yellow with age—"which, in some
                  manner, became mixed up with the articles of her wardrobe when they were placed in
                  a trunk to be brought to Williamsburg. Of the character of the paper, the poor
                  child knew nothing, and it was only discovered by accident yesterday, when she at
                  once declared whence it had come. Of the authenticity of the paper there can be no
                  doubt. You may see for yourselves, gentlemen!"</p>
               <p>With marks of great agitation, the speaker unfolded the paper.</p>
               <p>"See—the last will and testament of Henry Seaton, of Rivanna, in the county of
                  Albemarle, Esq.—written, I am informed by Lady Brand, in his own handwriting,
                  signed, sealed, and attested by two witnesses, both dead, I am further informed, a
                  number of years since, but whose writing could doubtless be identified. That is,
                  however, of no importance, as the paper is in Colonel Seaton's handwriting. You
                  will perceive the date—several months later than that of the will under which Lady
                  Brand holds the estate. You will see, at a glance, that Colonel Seaton devises his
                  entire landed estate to the elder of his nieces—the mother of the gentleman here
                  present, Mr. Edmund Innis."</p>
               <p>Colonel Brand, with a trembling hand, laid the paper on the table.</p>
               <p>"You will now understand, my lord," he added, with an effort, "what I meant in
                  saying that I and my family are beggared."</p>

               <p>FOR some moments the silence of death reigned in the apartment. It was first
                  broken by Ruthven, who had listened with profound attention, and now, when the

               <p>"You have related a very singular history, sir," he said, "and I have listened

               <p>"No necessity, my lord!" replied Colonel Brand. "Your pardon, in my turn, but I
                  think it was absolutely incumbent upon me to request your presence."</p>
               <p>"For what reason, sir?"</p>
               <p>"Simply in view of the relation<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6141-00000048"/> which you
                  sustained toward my family, as the accepted suitor of my daughter."</p>
               <p>"The relation which I <emph>sustained,</emph> sir?" said Ruthven. "Did I hear
                  aright?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my lord," returned Colonel Brand, with an obvious struggle to summon all his
                  fortitude; "to-day that relation necessarily no longer exists."</p>
               <p>"No longer exists!"</p>
               <p>"Assuredly not."</p>
               <p>"May I beg you to explain this extraordinary observation, sir?" said Ruthven. "In
                  Heaven's name, why should I not be still Miss Brand's accepted suitor?"</p>
               <p>"Because the engagement of my Lord Ruthven was to Miss Honoria Brand, the daughter
                  of Colonel Brand, of Rivanna—therefore to the heiress of one of the amplest
                  fortunes in Virginia—"</p>
               <p>"Well, well, sir!"</p>
               <p>The exclamation was almost impatient.</p>
               <p>"That was yesterday. To-day things are different. Your engagement was to a young
                  lady of great possessions, not to a portionless girl. Therefore it
                  terminates."</p>
               <p>"Terminates? Do I hear aright, sir? Am I, then, a vulgar person without dignity or
                  sentiments of honor? Did you really suppose that, in paying my addresses to Miss
                  Brand, I was actuated by the desire of <emph>gain?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"No, my lord—but this is a painful subject; let us not further discuss it."</p>
               <p>"Willingly, sir! The discussion is very far from agreeable to me. I have listened
                  to the statement of your family affairs, sir, and appreciate the compliment paid
                  me in making me a participant. That subject is now dismissed, and I may be
                  permitted to pass to one more agreeable to myself. No change will take place, I
                  trust, in the time fixed upon for my union with Miss Brand."</p>
               <p>"No change!—the time! Impossible—this union is impossible, my lord! My daughter
                  yesterday would have brought you a princely dower: to-day, she scarce possesses
                  more than the clothing she wears!"</p>
               <p>Ruthven inclined his head. "'Tis sufficient dowry for Miss Brand," he said.</p>
               <p>"Impossible, my lord!"</p>
               <p>Ruthven became almost irritated.</p>
               <p>"In the name of Heaven, sir!" he said, "what difference is there in the fact you
                  state?"</p>
               <p>"I cannot—!"</p>
               <p>Ruthven grew cool and ceremonious suddenly.</p>
               <p>"Colonel Brand," he said, "you are incapable of acting otherwise than as a
                  gentleman, and observing your word. Well, I insist upon the performance of your
                  promise—that you keep your plighted word!"</p>
               <p>"How can I?" exclaimed the agitated father, "the thing is not possible! I repeat,
                  sir, that we are beggars—beggars!—and that my child is penniless! There are some
                  promises which a gentleman should not be called upon to observe!—it violates every
                  sentiment of my bosom to take advantage of your magnanimity, and yield. Once more,
                  sir, we have nothing—absolutely nothing! And it is not, permit me to say, in
                  accordance with my views of propriety—with my weakness of pride, if you choose—to
                  permit a daughter of my house to leave her father's roof-tree like the child of a
                  peasant; to go forth, naked and portionless, to the stranger."</p>
               <p>Honoria and Innis had listened to this colloquy with an alternate hope and terror
                  which cruelly agitated them. Hope, despair, every emotion, tore their hearts; and
                  now all hung upon the reply of Ruthven.</p>
               <p>It came, and was uttered firmly and deliberately.</p>
               <p>"I have but one response to make to all you have said, sir: <emph>I hold
                     you—rigidly—to the performance of your solemn</emph>
                  <emph>promise—to your plighted word of honor.</emph>" The words were slow,
                  measured, and fell one by one, as it were, from the compressed lips of the
                  speaker.</p>
               <p>"My word of honor!" murmured Colonel Brand.</p>
               <p>"I mean your contract, if you prefer the word, sir, but 'word of honor' is a
                  stronger charm to conjure by, with persons of your character. You accepted me as
                  your daughter's suitor; gave me your word that she should become Lady Ruthven.
                  There all discussion ends, for you are a gentleman, and <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >noblesse oblige.</foreign>"</p>
               <p>Colonel Brand's head sank.</p>
               <p>"Well, have it as you will, my lord," he said; "you have overcome me by this
                  appeal to my honor. You demand the performance of my plighted word. I yield, and
                  consent to your union with my daughter.—But, bear witness, all present, that I
                  resisted this proposal to the last."</p>
               <p>He turned toward Honoria, looking at her with deep melancholy.</p>
               <p>"Pride! pride!" he muttered, in an agitated voice; "how despotic is that
                  sentiment! Would to God I had a portion for you, my child! my joy, my life,
                  wellnigh! That <emph>you</emph> should go forth a penniless betrothed!—Bear with
                  me, my lord! I am growing old, and prouder each day, I think! This is hard—hard!
                  But all is over; Honoria is your own, my Lord Ruthven—her hand awaits you—but
                     <emph>where</emph> she will thus await you when you come to claim her, I know
                  not."</p>
               <p>"Miss Brand will await my Lord Ruthven at Rivanna!"</p>
               <p>The words rang out, cold and measured, in the sudden silence. They were uttered by
                  Innis, who advanced a step as he spoke; and now, taking the will of Colonel Seaton
                  from the table, tore it in pieces.</p>
               <p>"As the representative of my mother, I am the legal owner of the estate of
                  Rivanna," he added. "This paper is the evidence of my right and title, and I
                  choose to destroy it. My cousin will thus have a suitable portion on her marriage,
                  and will await my Lord Ruthven in the home of her family."</p>
               <p>The words were uttered in the same cold and deliberate tone, and Innis turned
                  toward Lady Brand and Honoria.</p>
               <p>"I thank you for your goodness to me, aunt, and thank Heaven too, that I am able
                  to make you this small and poor return for all your love and tenderness; for you
                  have been like my own dear mother. But do not overvalue my act. For myself, I ask
                  nothing; I care not for this property. I shall leave Virginia, and, as this is our
                  last meeting, farewell. May God bless and keep you—and Honoria!"</p>
               <p>He turned toward the girl as he spoke, and his pale lips moved as though he wished
                  to say something to her. But no words were heard. The agony of his soul had
                  rendered the young man speechless, and he turned away and left the apartment.</p>
               <p>The actors in this singular scene remained silent and motionless.</p>
               <p>Upon the floor at Colonel Brand's feet, lay the fragments of the will which had
                  fallen from the hands of Innis at the moment when he tore the document to
                  pieces.</p>

               <head>XXXIX. RUTHVEN'S OATH.</head>
               <p>ON the night succeeding these events, Lord Ruthven sat up until nearly day-light,
                  writing. He was plainly not engaged upon an ordinary letter; the thin and nervous
                  hand moved with painful deliberation over the paper; and the expression of
                  Ruthven's face was that of a man who has bid farewell to his last hope on
                  earth.</p>
               <p>This man was evidently the victim of some secret misery which blotted out all
                  sunshine from his existence; his face was as pale as death, his lips like
                     ashes;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6141-00000049"/> and from time to time he
                  glanced over his shoulder with wild and startled eyes, as though he feared the
                  presence of some terrible intruder.</p>
               <p>At last he threw down the pen. He had not written rapidly; rather slowly,
                  painfully, with obvious effort and repugnance; and the sheets which he had covered
                  with writing were not numerous. He reflected for an instant; raised and read over
                  the sheets one by one; then folded them securely, sealed them; impressing his
                  signet-ring deeply into the wax, and deposited the package in his breast.</p>
               <p>Ruthven then uttered a deep sigh, and, rising, looked around him. Fergus was
                  seated in a corner of the great fire-place, nodding over the dying embers; for
                  nothing could induce the old clansman, with his rigid views of respect and
                  propriety, to retire to his own pallet until he had assisted his master in his
                  toilet. Ruthven had quite forgotten his presence now; but, as he rose, Fergus
                  stood up, and, in respectful silence, prepared to wait upon his lord.</p>
               <p>Ruthven motioned him to resume his seat, and said in a low voice:</p>
               <p>"I have written it down, Fergus."</p>
               <p>"Written what, my lord?" was the calm reply.</p>
               <p>"The whole truth—"</p>
               <p>Fergus gazed intently at his master.</p>
               <p>"The truth?" he said.</p>
               <p>"Yes!"</p>
               <p>"The <emph>whole?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Yes!"</p>
               <p>Fergus inclined his head, but said nothing.</p>
               <p>"Things may take the course that the devil would have them take," said Ruthven,
                  gloomily, "I know not—Fate drags us. But I do not wish to be regarded as a monster
                  of blood. Hence all is here written—that all may be known."</p>
               <p>"It is well, my lord."</p>
               <p>"I had it again last night, as you know," said Ruthven, in a low tone.</p>
               <p>"I supposed as much."</p>
               <p>"You had the right."</p>
               <p>"Naturally, my lord; inasmuch as your lordship sprang from your bed at midnight,
                  caught up your sword, and when I grappled with you, and took steps that you should
                  not harm yourself, your lordship made an attempt to put an end to
                  <emph>me.</emph>"</p>
               <p>Ruthven groaned.</p>
               <p>"O Fergus! Fergus! how and when will this end?" he exclaimed. "Pardon your poor,
                  miserable master, my old friend! Better, far better that I were insane, a diseased
                  lunatic, than the wretched being that I am, same as I may be!"</p>
               <p>Fergus did not reply.</p>
               <p>"Some day I shall kill <emph>you,</emph> Fergus—you, the most faithful of my
                  blood, for you are of the very blood of Ruthven, Fergus!"</p>
               <p>The old man's face was lift up with pride and happiness, as he listened to these
                  words, and, when he spoke, his voice showed that he was greatly moved.</p>
               <p>"Your lordship is very good, and makes your old clansman happy! They do say that
                  my great-great-grandfather was fifth cousin on the mother's side, to your
                  lordship's ancestor. But, doubtless 'tis folly for the clansman to compare himself
                  with his lord—let us think of other matters."</p>
               <p>"I can scarce think, to-night, my head is in a whirl, Fergus. I go on a dark and
                  bloody path, whose and I know not."</p>
               <p>"Why not stop, then?"</p>
               <p>"I cannot—I cannot!"</p>
               <p>Fergus replied with the eternal movement of his head, that said: "I am the
                  clansman, you my chief—I obey."</p>
               <p>"You say to me 'Stop,' but to stop is impossible now, even had I the power over my
                  own will! The betrothal has taken place in regular form; the word of Ruthven is
                  pledged, and cannot be recalled—and more, more—if more binding ing reason could
                  exist—you know what I would say; I love this girl! love her with all the power of
                  my being, and—will dare the worst!"</p>
               <p>"So be it, my lord," said Fergus, coolly raking the brands together; "it is
                  unfortunate but fatal, you say."</p>
               <p>"Yes, fatal, awful!"</p>
               <p>A long silence followed these words. Ruthven broke it by a groan.</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, no!" he exclaimed. "I cannot, I will not believe it!. I will not be
                  ensnared so horribly, even though the devil set the trap!"</p>
               <p>"He is a good hand at snares and traps, this same devil, my lord."</p>
               <p>"Speak not of it—!"</p>
               <p>"I obey your lordship—'tis well your order came in time."</p>
               <p>"You were about to say—"</p>
               <p>"Your lordship bids me be silent."</p>
               <p>"Speak!"</p>
               <p>"I would say that you have been duly warned."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes!"</p>
               <p>"You have seen both <emph>the man</emph> and <emph>the woman;</emph> things are
                  advancing as they were doomed to advance; your lordship has told me all—"</p>
               <p>"No, not all! I have not told you what I saw last night!" said Ruthven, in a
                  horror-struck whisper, which thrilled through the old clansman.</p>
               <p>"Last night?" he said, fixing his eyes upon his master. "What was that?"</p>
               <p>"I saw the actual spot—<emph>the whole</emph>—nothing was left out!"</p>
               <p>Fergus became slightly pale, but said, in a cool voice:</p>
               <p>"And yet, after this, you do not give up the affair?"</p>
               <p>"I cannot; I am powerless."</p>
               <p>Fergus nodded only, and this indifference seemed almost to enrage his master.</p>
               <p>"Your coldness drives me mad nearly!" he cried through his set teeth; "you do not
                  understand, then, that I am on <emph>the brink of an awful precipice!</emph>"</p>
               <p>And, as though he had not intended to utter these particular words—as though they
                  had forced themselves from his lips without an act of the will, Lord Ruthven
                  started, shuddered convulsively, and turned so pale that he seemed about to
                  faint.</p>
               <p>"My lord," said Fergus, "I have but one reply, to make to all this; but, as I have
                  already frequently made that reply, I shall not trouble you with it again."</p>
               <p>"Speak! speak!"</p>
               <p>"Well, I say again, my lord, 'Give up this affair, and let us go back to
                  Scotland.'"</p>
               <p>"I cannot!"</p>
               <p>"An answer which your lordship has before made; so be it. I see no advantage in
                  further discussion at this hour of the night."</p>
               <p>"A last word, Fergus—listen."</p>
               <p>"I listen, my lord."</p>
               <p>Lord. Ruthven's feverish excitement all at once disappeared, and he now said, with
                  a strange pathos and earnestness:</p>
               <p>"Fergus, my faithful friend, and foster-brother, you at least must not
                  misapprehend me, and execrate my memory. Listen, then. Despite the Evil One and
                  all his spirits, I will steel myself against temptation, and rather plunge that
                  poniard yonder into my heart than become the tool of Satan! I cannot draw back now
                  and return to Europe; my honor and my love both draw me on; but I would here, upon
                  the threshold, without a tremor of the nerve, put an end to my own existence, if I
                  thought I should yield in this frightful drama. Death—a thousand deaths first! I
                  swear I will crush this fate!—I have resolved, Fergus, even to resort to
                  self-destruction first! Living or dying thus, my faithful Fergus must love, not
                  curse, my memory!"</p>
               <p>Ruthven held out his hand to Fergus, who bent over it and pressed it to his
                  trembling lips. As the lips touched it, the young nobleman felt a hot tear fall
                  upon his hand.</p>
               <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6141-00000050"/>
               <p>"In life and death I am your clansman—it is you who are the chief!"</p>
               <p>And, as he uttered these low words, the old man's heart melted, and he sobbed
                  aloud.</p>

               <p>THERE has survived the tempest of these events which we are recording, a little
                  MS. volume in which Meta, the orphan, wrote down her whole life. Many pages of

               <p>From this record the following leaf is taken, as necessary to the comprehension of
                  our history, which deals less with Meta than with others. It was written, as the
                  reader will perceive, immediately after her restoration to reason, and clearly
                  paints her life and feelings at the moment:</p>
               <p>"After a long sleep, I seem to have awakened, as it were—no longer a poor, insane
                  human creature, but, as mamma taught me to read in the Holy Book, 'Clothed, and in
                  my right mind.'</p>
               <p>"I have lived for years, I think, in a sort of dream-life, like twilight when the
                  sun has gone down; and the world around me now seems so strange, and so sad!
                  Naught surrounds me but unhappiness—and, O me, <emph>he</emph> is the unhappiest
                  of all! Shall I write of him—and of—myself? I scarce dare place this feeling upon
                  paper, but why should I not? It was, and is, only love—the fond, simple love of a
                  poor child that I felt for him—Edmund. I write the name, Edmund, with a throb of
                  the heart; but, 'tis written, and gives me strength to go on. I loved him very,
                  very much, and love him as dearly now: but, no longer to watch him, and scheme to
                  make him unhappy. Oh, no, no! I would give my life for him—my poor, worthless
                  life, which I think will not last long. I think I could die happy, telling him,
                  "Tis for your happiness I die!'</p>
               <p>"I must not write down these exclamations, but remember what has happened, rather
                  than what I have felt. At Rivanna, I was very, very vile—I was nearly the death of
                  my dearly-loved Honoria, by frightening her so; and I then acted from a base,
                  wretched jealousy of her. I was so vile that I could have killed her to separate
                  her and <emph>him!</emph> Now, all is changed. It may be even that I shall bring
                  him happiness. By my act, he is no longer a poor, penniless boy, but the lord of
                  Rivanna.</p>
               <p>"This came about so strangely! In the old chest, where I tried to hide that night,
                  I found many things which I hid away, and, among others, a paper which became
                  mixed with my clothes, and was so brought to the capital. Before I knew any thing
                  of this, came that strange change in my whole life—the removal, by Dr. Vandyke, my
                  dear, good friend, of the cause of my insanity. I remember nothing of that, save a
                  strange, dull feeling, a sinking, and an awakening, to find my reason, and my
                  power of hearing and speaking, all restored. Of my rapture I cannot speak. It was
                  like entering a new world, and I recalled but dimly what had taken place in all
                  those years, during which I was a poor, unreasoning, cunning, scheming lunatic.
                  And it was just at this moment that, looking in my travelling-trunk one day, I
                  chanced to discover the paper taken from the old chest, and remembered where I had
                  found it. I read it with wonder, and scarcely understanding it at first, but soon
                  its great importance was plain to me. I had heard vague rumors of another will of
                  Colonel Season's, and, now, here was this will, leaving all his property to
                  Edmund's mother!</p>
               <p>"I held the paper in my hand, gazing at it with a fixed look, and thinking.
                     <emph>To think</emph> was almost a pain to me, but gradually I linked one
                  thought to another, and said to myself: 'This paper, which makes Edmund wealthy,
                  gives him Honoria. Her father would never consent to Honoria's marriage with a
                  penniless youth; but, if the youth be a rich suitor, the master of Rivanna, he
                  will consent!' That thought dazzled me, and made me wretched. Then <emph>he</emph>
                  and Honoria would be happy—<emph>I</emph> should be wretched! In my hand I held
                  their future life—it would be <emph>I</emph> who would give <emph>her</emph> to
                     <emph>him!</emph> I shook, and felt the evil spirit tempting me. To burn the
                  paper would be as easy as to produce it. Why not burn it?</p>
               <p>"I looked at the paper for a little while, and then fell on my knees, and prayed
                  for strength to resist temptation; and got up, and ran to dear aunt, and cried:
                  'Here it is!—here it is! Take it—take it!' She looked at me in great surprise, and
                  wished me to tell her where I had gotten the paper; but I burst out crying, and
                  for a long time went on sobbing, as she clasped me in her dear arms. Then I told
                  her, and she hurriedly called Uncle Brand, who came quickly, and read the paper,
                  turning very pale as he did so. When he had read it in silence, and turned it
                  over, and examined it, he groaned, and said: 'This beggars us; but there is but
                  one thing to be done. Rivanna is not ours, but his; and must be surrendered to
                  him.' He then questioned me, and I told him of the discovery of the paper, when he
                  knit his brows, but said no more, and left the room, carrying the paper with him.
                  A painful scene followed this. I was led by aunt one morning into the
                  drawing-room, and Edmund and Lord Ruthven soon came, and Uncle Brand spoke of the
                  will. Edmund tore it in pieces, and left the room—Lord Ruthven having claimed, as
                  he said, Uncle Brand's 'plighted word of honor' that he should marry Cousin
                  Honoria.</p>
               <p>"Poor, poor, Honoria! There is no hope for her or for him—Edmund! Uncle Brand is
                  not to be moved, and Honoria and Lord Ruthven will surely be married. I do not
                  rejoice at it—oh, no—no! My heart bleeds to think of <emph>his</emph>
                  unhappiness—of how much he will suffer. Why, oh, why do such things happen in this
                  world? Why should his heart be broken when he loves Honoria so—and all that she
                  may marry a lord? What is a lord? Is he better than a gentleman? Compare Edmund
                  and Lord Ruthven, and who shall say that Edmund is not the better worth loving?
                  But there is no hope for him. Uncle Brand would rather die, and have his daughter
                  made miserable, than break his 'word' when he has once given it. I heard him say
                  as much, but I do not think that he understands or believes she will be unhappy.
                  He has said to aunt, more than once, in my hearing: 'Pshaw!—this fancy for her
                  cousin is nothing. <emph>Lady Ruthven</emph> will soon be consoled women are
                  fickle!' Are they? I know not how it may be with others: but one poor, weak girl—a
                  girl, not a woman—would <emph>die</emph> if she could buy thus the happiness of
                  one she has loved long, and dearly, and faithfully!</p>
               <p>"I am not well to-day. Exposure in a thin dress at the great assembly, at the
                  governor's palace, has given me what aunt calls 'a cold,' and a sharp pang strikes
                  through my breast at times. I feel so weak; but all is in God's hands. He knows
                  what is best for me. My life is not sunshine that I should cling to it, and I see
                  little happiness for me in the future. And, yet, I do not repine. <emph>He</emph>
                  can never love <emph>me;</emph> but I can love <emph>him,</emph> and pray for him,
                  and think night and day of him. Oh, may he be happier, and forget this misery, and
                  be a good man, and think sometimes, when I am gone, of his poor Meta!—"</p>

               <p>"We leave Williamsburg to-morrow. I have told no one, but I think I am going to be

            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>XLI. THE RETURN.</head>
               <p>WHEN it was announced that "the Brand beauty" and her almost equally lovely sister
                  were about to leave the capital in the height of the fashionable season, a great
                  sensation took place among the gallants of that gallant epoch.</p>
               <p>Honoria had partially enslaved more than one "fine gentleman" of the place and
                  time; and these now uttered piteous sighs at her intended departure; wrote verses
                  in her honor; and were incessant in their attempts to obtain speech of her, and
                  bid her farewell.</p>
               <p>The young lady, however, resolutely denied herself to all visitors; remained in
                  her chamber like an invalid, and even sent her excuses to Lord Ruthven when he
                  came, the accepted suitor being placed on the same footing as the rest.</p>
               <p>When at last the great chariot rolled up to the door one bright winter morning,
                  and Honoria made her appearance, clad in her travelling-dress, her admirers, who
                  had received notice of the intended "flitting," obtained a last view of her, and
                  followed her to the very door of the chariot. All wondered at her pale face, and
                  the apathetic eyes in which dwelt a settled sadness. They felt that a portion of
                  the beauty and splendor of the capital was leaving it; but this splendor was
                  evidently under a cloud—the sunshine was dimmed—and, above all, they no longer had
                  any hope, having ascertained Honoria's formal betrothal to Lord Ruthven, who
                  assisted her into the chariot. They therefore kissed their hands, uttered a few
                  gallant speeches, wished their lady-love a pleasant journey, and went to court
                  some other dulcinea, and celebrate her in love-verses in the poet's corner of the
                  Virginia <title>Gazette.</title>
               </p>
               <p>So Honoria rolled away from Williamsburg, and out of that splendid
                  society—forgotten. She did not regret it. Sinking back in a seat, beside her
                  sister, and opposite her father and mother, she covered her face with a scarf, and
                  was soon lost in the dangerous land of reverie.</p>
               <p>It is needless to say that she was thinking of one person only, Edmund Innis. He
                  had left Williamsburg some time before, without even giving his friend Phil Cary
                  an opportunity to see him. For the rest, it is doubtful if Mr. Philip Cary, riding
                  now beside the coach, Miss Lou Brand's accepted suitor, had thoughts for any human
                  being except the queenly girl with whom, as he gallantly caracoled at the window,
                  he exchanged those glances which are the joy of youth and love, and which we
                  elders laugh at and regret so.</p>
               <p>Beside her sister, who was all happiness, Honoria was the spirit of sadness. Her
                  life had suddenly changed on the day when her father had announced his will. From
                  that moment she had shrunk from the brilliant scenes in which she had shone with a
                  nervous terror and disgust. All that splendor had grown dull and dreary; she lived
                  in a sort of dream; and a strange apathy had seized upon her, paralyzing all her
                  faculties. She had but one sentiment now, besides her settled despair—it was a
                  longing to be away from noise and bustle and prying eyes; from the scenes where
                  she must speak, and reply to what was spoken; and, burying herself in her quiet
                  chamber in the silent old walls of Rivanna, collect, if possible, her weary
                  thoughts, and summon strength for the woful sacrifice which loomed up before her,
                  like a coming fate.</p>
               <p>The old family chariot rolled slowly on its way toward the mountains, stopping
                  each night at the house of some one of the gentry, Colonel Brand's friends—for, at
                  that time, entertainment of travellers at the old Virginia country houses was
                  regarded as a matter of course—and in due time the lumbering vehicle, drawn by its
                  stalwart bays, entered the great gate of Rivanna, and ascended the hill, upon
                  which stood the old mansion.</p>
               <p>As it passed beneath the great oak-trees, bare and spectral now, divested of their
                  leaves, Honoria looked toward that particular tree, beneath whose wide boughs she
                  and Innis had plighted their troth, and a pang, like an acute physical pain,
                  passed through her heart. There his lips had pressed her own, and she had leaned
                  her cheek upon his breast, her innocent heart throbbing as she felt his arm
                  encircle her in that long, pure, lingering embrace. There she had looked into his
                  frank eyes and read the treasure of his love; had avowed her own in a murmur as
                  low and soft as the whisper of the wind in the leaves—all that scene, gone now so
                  long into the past, rose up again before her, and made her wretched. He had left
                  her!—she was betrothed to another! The sunshine and music and singing-birds had
                  gone out of her life—the great oak was bare and forbidding, no longer musical with
                  song and laughter; and the change was a type of that which had taken place in her
                  own fate. She turned away her eyes, uttered a sob which she could not suppress,
                  and soon afterward was in her chamber, weeping as though her very heart were
                  breaking.</p>
               <p>She had promised herself comfort and calmness, when once back to her old home; and
                  now every object, like the weird oak, reminded her of her past happiness, and made
                  her wretched. There was the wide hall where she and Edmund had so often walked up
                  and down in happy talk; the drawing-room, where so many sunny hours had fled away
                  in his society; her mother's chamber, where it had been his habit to repair
                  regularly as soon as he entered the mansion, and where the great chair by the
                  fireplace seemed still to retain the impress of his form: these, and a hundred
                  other parts of the house, still spoke of him, recalling him to mind; and Honoria
                  was plunged into a despair greater than any which she had yet experienced. She
                  felt now the full extent of what she had lost; and when at last she threw herself
                  upon her bed at night, in a fit of passionate weeping, she felt that death would
                  be a relief from her agony.</p>
               <p>But the strong hours march, regardless of joy and woe. Honoria fell from despair
                  into a sombre apathy. She scarcely ever left her chamber, and seldom uttered more
                  than a few commonplace words in response to what was said to her.</p>
               <p>She seemed to be looking forward with a sort of terror to the day—but a few weeks
                  off now—when Lord Ruthven would appear at Rivanna, and claim her hand. When that
                  thought came to her, she shuddered, and felt faint.</p>

               <head>XLII. THE SEARCH FOR INNIS.</head>
               <p>RIVANNA, in the gloomy days of that winter, was a sad place; and the very servants
                  went about in silence, treading warily, as though fearful of arousing echoes in
                  the dreary mansion.</p>
               <p>Colonel Brand remained shut up almost constantly in his library, and had few words
                  for anybody. Lady Brand, subjugated by the imperious will of her husband—a person
                  whom she had rather feared than loved from the day of their marriage—said nothing,
                  uttered no remonstrance, but seemed to grow sadder<pb n="96-97"
                     xml:id="VAC6141-00000052"/> and older day by day; and Meta, who spent most of
                  her time upon a couch, breathing with difficulty, was often surprised shedding
                  tears.</p>
               <p>The only member of the family who preserved even the semblance of a sad
                  cheerfulness was Lou Brand, whose buoyant disposition enabled her to combat in
                  some slight degree the general tendency to gloom. Phil Cary was at Rivanna almost
                  daily—for he was the formally-acknowledged <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >affiancé</foreign> of the young lady; and they talked interminably of the sad
                  state of things.</p>
               <p>One day Lou Brand, after gazing for some moments into the fire, said:</p>
               <p>"Philip, you really must find where Edmund is, and why we never hear of or from
                  him."</p>
               <p>"You then wish me to try again?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, yes!"</p>
               <p>"You know how unsuccessful I have been. As soon as I got back from Williamsburg, I
                  lost no time in going to find him, knowing that he had ridden already away from
                  the capital. I rode up the mountain to his house, and found doors, windows,
                  shutters, all closed, and not even a servant. I tried a second
                  time—knocked—shouted—no one came. Shall I make a third attempt?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; I <emph>must</emph> know something about him! Yesterday my poor Honoria
                  asked me, in a low voice, what had become of him, and I could tell her
                  nothing."</p>
               <p>Phil Cary sighed deeply.</p>
               <p>"I will try once more, then," he said, "but would to Heaven this sad tragedy were
                  over!"</p>
               <p>"Would that it were! Rivanna, that was so cheerful once, is like a tomb. Meta is
                  hopelessly ill, I fear, and I shall not be astonished to find her take to her bed
                  at any instant. O me! what will become of us!"</p>
               <p>And the impulsive and warm-hearted girl burst into tears. She almost instantly
                  dried her eyes, however, and said:</p>
               <p>"Why not go to-day?"</p>
               <p>"To-day? I shall lose so much of your society. You know I am compelled to go to
                  Williamsburg on business to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"The more reason, Philip, to relieve poor Honoria's mind. Try, for the last time,
                  to see Edmund; it will make my poor sister happier to hear of him, and we can do
                  nothing better in this sad world than to make somebody happier."</p>
               <p>Phil Cary looked at the speaker with great tenderness, and exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"You are a dear, good girl, Lou! That anybody should regard you as careless and
                  unthinking! I will go at once, and return before evening, if possible."</p>
               <p>And, in ten minutes, the young man was on horseback, riding in the direction of
                  the western mountains.</p>
               <p>It was a dreary, chilling landscape through which he passed. On the day before, a
                  heavy snow had fallen, and the fields were one great shroud; the mountain
                  evergreens weighed down with the masses of snow which had clung to them. The
                  atmosphere, gray, hazy, and ominous, indicated another storm; and the wind, rising
                  and falling fitfully, died away, in the dense masses of pine, in a sorrowful
                  moan.</p>
               <p>Phil Cary pushed on through the deep snow, following the narrow road only by means
                  of the opening in the firs, for no track was visible; and thus slowly and with
                  difficulty ascended the mountain, amid whose gorges the wind, now grown keener,
                  howled and groaned. But one living thing had met his gaze—an immense eagle; which
                  rose, flapping his enormous wings, from a pine-tree, as the rider approached, to
                  wing his way deeper into the solitary fastnesses.</p>
               <p>An hour's ride brought the young man at last in sight of Innis's small house in a
                  gash of the mountain. No smoke rose from the chimney; no sign of habitation was
                  visible. He dismounted, knocked, received no reply, then he shouted; still no
                  reply came; and at the end of half an hour the young man remounted his horse, and
                  descended the mountain by the same path which he had pursued in ascending. He had
                  uttered but two words as he turned away from the deserted house—</p>
               <p>"Poor Edmund!"</p>
               <p>At Rivanna distressing intelligence greeted him. Meta had been taken suddenly ill,
                  and at one time Lady Brand, who had been hastily summoned, feared that she would
                  die. When the young man reached the house, she was better; but such was Lady
                  Brand's anxiety, that she requested Phil Cary, whose design of visiting the
                  capital was known to her, to beg Dr. Vandyke to come, if possible, and see the
                  child.</p>
               <p>"Nothing stops that very remarkable man, when he can relieve suffering," said Lady
                  Brand. "Beg him to come to me, Philip—I feel as though his presence would do good
                  to us all. We are a sad, a very sad family, Philip!"</p>
               <p>And the kind lady hastened to the side of Meta.</p>
               <p>On the next morning Phil Cary set out for Williamsburg.</p>
               <p>Five days afterward, hour for hour from that evening, Dr. Vandyke got out of his
                  carriage, and, entering the house, said:</p>
               <p>"Well, how is the child?"</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>XLIII. DR. VANDYKE'S DIAGNOSIS.</head>
               <p>DR. VANDYKE arrived toward nightfall, and was up with Meta until a late hour of
                  the night.</p>
               <p>On the next morning he requested that his carriage might be ordered, as it was
                  necessary that he should return to Williamsburg.</p>
               <p>Colonel Brand, of whom this request was made, protested with ceremonious courtesy
                  against this sudden return; but the eccentric physician responded:</p>
               <p>"I have my sick to see to. I must go, but desire first some conversation with
                  yourself, sir."</p>
               <p>"Some conversation, sir?" repeated Colonel Brand.</p>
               <p>"In private."</p>
               <p>"Willingly, sir."</p>
               <p>And the colonel led the way to the library, closing the door behind them.</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke came to the point with his habitual directness.</p>
               <p>"Do you know that two members of your household are as good as dying?" he
                  said.</p>
               <p>"Two members!—good Heavens, sir! You mean—"</p>
               <p>"Your daughter Honoria, and the child Meta."</p>
               <p>Colonel Brand looked inexpressibly shocked; but, before he could reply, the
                  physician continued in the same abrupt, matter-of-fact voice:</p>
               <p>"First, to speak of Meta. She 'caught cold,' as fools say, at the governor's ball,
                  where, after the mad fashion of young ladies in general, she went in a gossamer
                  dress, and shoes as thin as paper—that is to say, her lungs, never strong, became
                  diseased—the disease was not crushed in its infancy, as perhaps might have been
                  done; and the consequence is, that the projected wedding of your daughter Honoria
                  promises to be followed by a funeral."</p>
               <p>"Your intelligence deeply distresses me!" exclaimed Colonel Brand. "I had not
                  supposed—"</p>
               <p>"That things were so bad, you would say?"</p>
               <p>"I had not, sir."</p>
               <p>"Well, I put you in possession of the exact state of the case."</p>
               <p>Colonel Brand knit his brows. Suddenly he turned to the physician.</p>
               <p>"But—" he said.</p>
               <p>"You mean that Meta is not Miss Brand?"</p>
               <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6141-00000053"/>
               <p>"You spoke also of Miss Brand, sir—made, if I understood you aright, a very
                  surprising statement in regard to <emph>her.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"I did. I said that Honoria Brand was as good as dying—as bad, I should have said;
                  for death, whatever fanciful people say, is bad, very bad—and not good in any
                  sense."</p>
               <p>"You astound me, sir! Honoria ill? I was aware that the dissipations of the
                  capital, extremely late hours, and excitement, had—"</p>
               <p>"Colonel Brand," said Dr. Vandyke.</p>
               <p>"Sir!"</p>
               <p>"Do you consider me a fool?"</p>
               <p>"A fool? Really, sir, this conversation, you will permit me to say, is assuming an
                  unusual—a very unusual character!"</p>
               <p>"Because I speak to the point; and speaking to the point, I grant you, is unusual
                  in this world of froth and circumlocution! I say that you either regard me as a
                  ninny, or you wish to avoid hearing what I am going to tell you—since you know, as
                  well as I know, that Honoria's condition is due in no measure whatever to either
                  late hours, dissipation, or excitement in society."</p>
               <p>"Indeed, sir," said Colonel Brand, drawing himself up with some <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">hauteur,</foreign> "you are very good to take the trouble of
                  informing yourself so profoundly upon the private affairs of my family."</p>
               <p>"I have the right to do so."</p>
               <p>"What right, sir?"</p>
               <p>"The right of a man who was once in love with your wife, and who swore to her when
                  the last parting came—when she was about to marry—that if ever she were in
                  trouble, and I could help her, I would speak out, caring for nothing, and be a
                  friend to her!"</p>
               <p>The announcement seemed wellnigh to take away the stately colonel's breath. He
                  gazed at the now fiery Dr. Vandyke, who was glaring at him fixedly, with a mixture
                  of astonishment and <foreign xml:lang="FRA">hauteur</foreign> wonderful to
                  see.</p>
               <p>"You know now why I am meddling—in your family affairs," said the eccentric
                  physician. "You call it <emph>meddling</emph>—well, I reply that meddling
                  is—meddling: and I am simply affording you information—laying before you the
                  result of a medical diagnosis, made last night, of your daughter's condition. Act
                  as you please—it is no part of my business to try the pathetic. I tell you that
                  Honoria Brand is the victim of what is called, in the mummery of society, a
                     <emph>decline</emph>—that is to say, she is undermined by a slow fever which is
                  going to kill her; and the fever is due, neither to dissipation, late hours, nor
                  excitement, but to the prospect of marrying Lord Ruthven, when she loves her
                  cousin, Edmund Innis."</p>
               <p>The words were blurted out with little ceremony. Dr. Vandyke, was, evidently,
                  either too much in earnest to care for forms, or aimed, by the very rudeness of
                  his address, to strike more heavily, and produce the desired effect. His words,
                  indeed, seemed to impress Colonel Brand strangely. He turned red and then pale,
                  his lip trembled slightly, and he cleared his throat twice before replying.</p>
               <p>"Your very—ahem!—extraordinary communication," he at length said, with affected
                  coolness and ceremony, which his agitation belied, "leaves me at a loss, sir, how
                  to reply. I am, then, to regard this communication as due to—"</p>
               <p>"My affection for Lady Brand? Yes. Let that be stated plainly. I was her suitor—a
                  poor suitor. She married you. Well, I said nothing; did not make a fool of myself
                  by falling into a rage. I said, 'A woman chooses her own destiny—or has it chosen
                  for her—I will be this one's friend in spite of all;' and I prove myself her
                  friend by saying to you, 'If you persist in this design of forcing your daughter
                  into the arms of Ruthven, he will have a corpse for a bride!'"</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke rose as he spoke, and added:</p>
               <p>"I have said all that I intended to say, except to communicate a slight
                  circumstance of which you may be ignorant."</p>
               <p>"Your slight circumstance, if it please you, sir," said Colonel Brand, with sudden
                  ire, "your chivalric espousal of the interests of my family, leads me to
                  anticipate newer and more startling intelligence!"</p>
               <p>"Pride—pride!" growled Dr. Vandyke, <foreign xml:lang="ITA">sotto voce.</foreign>
                  "This figure in buckram, dubbed 'colonel,' is a <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >simulacrum</foreign> worked by that mainspring! Pull the string, he jumps to
                  it!"</p>
               <p>"You say, sir—"</p>
               <p>"That I am a fool to come here, and give you the result of my diagnosis of your
                  daughter's condition. I am an intruder—a meddler! Well, at least, you know all
                  now. I tell you that Honoria Brand is sinking day by day under this terror—that
                  her life is not worth twelve months' purchase; that she loves one man with
                  absolute passion, and you think to force her, without fatal results, into the
                  embrace of another! Do so, then—you are master! I am not here to beg you to do
                  this or to do that. I have no more to say—yes, one word more, to inform you of the
                  trifling circumstance to which allusion was made by me just now. Your proposed
                  son-in-law, my Lord Ruthven, is mad."</p>
               <p>"Mad!"</p>
               <p>"I use the colloquial term. <emph>Insane,</emph> if you prefer the word—I call him
                  mad."</p>
               <p>Colonel Brand seemed utterly, astounded.</p>
               <p>"And what proof have you to allege in support of this very astounding—this most
                  absurd statement, sir?"</p>
               <p>"None but the fact—I say he is mad; and, if you doubt it now, you will ascertain
                  the fact hereafter. Do not question me further! I have already said more than
                  becomes the physician who has attended a patient. The physician and the priest are
                  bound to silence. Act as seems best to you—for myself, I wish you good-day,
                  sir!"</p>
               <p>And Dr. Vandyke abruptly left the room—he had already taken leave of everybody—and
                  hastened to his coach, which he entered, slamming the door.</p>
               <p>The vehicle rolled down the hill rapidly, and passed through the great gate.</p>
               <p>"Toward Williamsburg, sir?" said the driver, drilled to ask those directions which
                  Dr. Vandyke never gave.</p>
               <p>"No!" exclaimed the physician, almost furiously—" to the mountain!"</p>
               <p>And he pointed westward.</p>
               <p>The obedient Jehu, without a word, turned his leaders to the right, and followed
                  the road which Phil Cary had pursued in his ride to Innis's dwelling. No snow had
                  fallen since the youth's ride, and, save where the wind had obliterated the
                  tracks, the footprints of his horse were still visible. But Dr. Vandyke seemed
                  perfectly familiar with the route.</p>
               <p>The coach ascended the mountain-road, drawn rapidly by four powerful horses, which
                  plunged through the deep snow, snorting and smoking.</p>
               <p>"A cheerful landscape!" muttered Dr. Vandyke, blowing his fingers to keep them
                  warm. "To live in this elevated wilderness, and have your sweetheart about to
                  marry another—ough!" And the physician knit his brows, and fell back, shouting to
                  his coachman: "Faster!—there is the house I am going to!"</p>
               <p>The small lodge of Innis was indeed visible beneath the great pines; and in
                  fifteen minutes more the coach had stopped before it.</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke got out, and waded through the snow, and knocked.</p>
               <p>"The door opened as he touched it. Innis was seen standing on the threshold.</p>
               <p>"Welcome, doctor!" he said; "I saw you coming up the mountain, and was awaiting
                  you."</p>
               <p>"It is well," returned Dr. Vandyke,<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6141-00000054"/>
                  looking at the young man from under his bushy brows. "I had sworn to break down
                  this door, if kicking would break it down!"</p>
               <p>And he entered.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>XLIV. THE LETTER.</head>
               <p>COLONEL BRAND had closed the door of the library behind Dr. Vandyke, reseated
                  himself with evident marks of agitation in his great arm-chair, and was sunk in
                  troubled thought, when a timid knock was heard. He said, harshly, "Come in!" and
                  Lady Brand entered.</p>
               <p>She was pale, and trembled slightly, for Colonel Brand had achieved that poor
                  triumph of making all around him afraid of him. His wife was no exception—she
                  stood in awe of the stiff personage; but now she had evidently made up her mind to
                  brave his ire.</p>
               <p>"Dr. Vandyke leaves us in displeasure, I fear," she said, approaching and seating
                  herself. "Is it not in consequence of a conversation in reference to Honoria?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, madam!" snapped Colonel Brand, losing all his <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >hauteur.</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>"Oh, tell me! Did he not urge you to break off our poor child's marriage with Lord
                  Ruthven?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, madam!"</p>
               <p>"Upon the ground that—that—she loved Edmund Innis, and shrunk from Lord
                  Ruthven?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, madam!"</p>
               <p>These three "Yes, madams!" were uttered with increasing vehemence.</p>
               <p>Colonel Brand had grown fiery, and looked dangerous.</p>
               <p>"Then—oh! then!—'tis your own poor child, remember—!"</p>
               <p>"Stop, madam!" exclaimed Colonel Brand; "this interview which you are good enough
                  to inflict upon me at a very inopportune moment—I say a very in opportune moment,
                  madam!—has proceeded sufficiently far! It is unnecessary to continue it, and, to
                  speak plainly, I desire you to be silent! I am the master in this house, for the
                  present at least, and I will not have my will disputed in consequence of the
                  underhand schemes—the meddling interference—of this Dr. Vandyke—this dwarf, who
                  had the insolence—yes, the insolence, madam!—to inform me that—that—he had been,
                  forsooth, once upon a time, your suitor—that is to say, <emph>my</emph>
                  rival!"</p>
               <p>The poor lady's head sank, and her frame trembled.</p>
               <p>"There was no wrong done," she murmured, a slight color appearing in the thin
                  cheek. "I was a girl, and Dr. Vandyke was a young gentleman highly respected."</p>
               <p>"We will cease to discuss your former affairs of the heart, if it please you,
                  madam!"</p>
               <p>"Willingly," said Lady Brand, sadly. "I designed no allusion whatever to them. But
                  it is my duty, and I must perform it, however it may excite your displeasure—it is
                  my duty as a mother, to say that I think Honoria is wasting away, will
                     <emph>die,</emph> if—"</p>
               <p>The faltering voice here quite broke down.</p>
               <p>"Oh, do not insist on this marriage!" she exclaimed.</p>
               <p>Colonel Brand was not as completely master of himself as he fancied. The trembling
                  voice shook his stern coldness. Wheeling round and facing the lady, he
                  exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"You would, then, have me break my plighted word!"</p>
               <p>"You did not know of this terrible result when you gave your word."</p>
               <p>"This is sophistry, madam!—the jugglery of reasoning, which smooths over a breach
                  of faith, because to keep it is not agreeable or desirable! No, madam! I have
                  sworn that Honoria shall marry Lord Ruthven, and I will keep my oath!"</p>
               <p>Lady Brand bowed her head, and fixed her eyes, red with weeping, upon the
                  carpet.</p>
               <p>"So be it," she said, in a low voice; "but if Honoria dies, I shall die too."</p>
               <p>Colonel Brand's features contracted, but he only replied:</p>
               <p>"I must keep faith."</p>
               <p>Lady Brand raised her head and looked at him.</p>
               <p>"Even if he—Lord Ruthven—exhibits a desire to retire from the affair?"</p>
               <p>"'Lord Ruthven retire!' Lord Ruthven exhibit a desire to—" Your meaning,
                  madam?"</p>
               <p>"I mean that Lord Ruthven treats our daughter and ourselves with scant
                  courtesy."</p>
               <p>"You would say—"</p>
               <p>"That a month, wellnigh, has passed since we have heard from him, and he has not
                  visited Rivanna at all.</p>
               <p>Colonel Brand turned pale. He had required no notice of the fact, but had avoided
                  all allusion to it.</p>
               <p>"Something has prevented him—the mails are irregular," he said, knitting his
                  brows.</p>
               <p>"Other letters from the capital arrive promptly."</p>
               <p>Colonel Brand was silent. He had not been prepared for this direct discussion of a
                  circumstance which had secretly stung him, and had no reply ready.</p>
               <p>"I thank Heaven," said Lady Brand, "that Lord Ruthven has not visited us, and am
                  even pleased at his not having written. O Colonel Brand! Honoria's apathy is
                  fearful—worse a thousand times than agitation—than despair!"</p>
               <p>The father groaned.</p>
               <p>"And all comes from this infatuation for a boy—a curly pate—this Edmund
                  Innis!"</p>
               <p>"'Twas natural!—he is a generous and noble boy."</p>
               <p>"You would say that he is generous to <emph>us!</emph> But you know well my
                  resolution, madam! I say this 'noble boy' has produced our household misery, and,
                  by Heaven! Honoria shall marry Ruthven if only to teach him a lesson!—Speak no
                  further of this, madam! I have sworn, and will keep my oath! Honoria is promised
                  to Lord Ruthven, and he shall have her, if I am alive to give her away! This
                  'apathy' you speak of is the folly of a child! Once Lady Ruthven—a countess,
                  madam!—she will forget all else. Now, no more of this. I am resolved!"</p>
               <p>Lady Brand rose and placed her handkerchief to her eyes.</p>
               <p>As she did so, a servant entered and handed respectfully to his master the bag
                  containing the mail. The first letter he drew forth was one from Lord Ruthven,
                  which he opened and hastily perused.</p>
               <p>"As I supposed, madam," he said, "Lord Ruthven has been ill—is so still. But he
                  expresses an earnest hope that his recovery will be sufficiently safe to enable
                  him to claim Honoria's hand upon the day appointed for the ceremony. See the
                  letter."</p>
               <p>But Lady Brand made a movement with her thin hand.</p>
               <p>"I do not desire to read it," she said, "and I must return to Honoria."</p>
               <p>She left the room as she spoke, uttering a low sob as she disappeared.</p>
               <p>The sob was echoed by a groan from the proud gentleman, who sank back in his
                  chair—bent, shrunken, and looking ten years older than an hour before.</p>

               <head>XLV. IN WHICH DR. VANDYKE PROPOSES TO MAKE A NIGHT OF IT.</head>
               <p>DR. VANDYKE walked into the small sitting-room of Innis's mountain lodge, with the
                  air of a gentleman who feels perfectly at home; and posting himself with his back
                  to the fire, his slender legs wide apart, and his voluminous skirts<pb n="102-103"
                     xml:id="VAC6141-00000055"/> gathered under his arms, looked around with
                  interest and some curiosity.</p>
               <p>The room was small and low-pitched, but with an ample fireplace, in which a fire
                  of heavy logs was quietly burning, the mass supported on old-fashioned brass
                  andirons, with grotesquely-carved heads, resembling the ancient masks. The carpet
                  had once been superb, with bouquets of flowers in their natural colors, but was
                  now quite faded, and, where the legs of the small square table in the centre of
                  the room rested upon it, was worn with holes which showed the floor beneath. The
                  furniture of the room was very old, but had evidently belonged to persons of taste
                  and elegance. It consisted of a large carved sofa of some dark wood covered with
                  rich cloth, and an old sideboard with worn silver, some chairs with
                  elaborately-ornamented backs and dark cushions, two large armchairs on each side
                  of the fireplace, a venerable harpsichord, and a tall clock in one corner,
                  reaching from the floor to the ceiling, with a great white face, black hands, and
                  colored representations of the sun, moon, and stars, above the face. On the walls,
                  yellow with age, were a number of engravings representing the battle of Blenheim,
                  and other scenes in the wars of Marlborough, wherein the roughly-engraved figures
                  of wooden-looking human beings lay about, and automata-like horses pranced in the
                  cavalry-charge; and on each side of the mantel-piece, which was very tall and
                  supported a few books, was a comic engraving by Hogarth, the one representing a
                  cock-fight, and the other the idle apprentice playing upon a tombstone. There were
                  but two portraits in the room—those of Innis's father and mother. These faced each
                  other on the eastern and western walls, and represented, the first a gentleman of
                  distinguished bearing, his smiling face half covered by a flowing peruke; the
                  other a lady of great beauty and very high-spirited appearance—the frames of dark
                  oak, the canvas dingy. In one corner, a fowling-piece leaned, supporting a
                  bird-bag of netted twine; and near this a small bookcase stood against the wall,
                  half filled with odd volumes in brown leather, of histories, poems, romances, and
                  treatises on English law.</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke took in these details of the apartment with a comprehensive glance;
                  drew a huge watch from his fob, and consulted it, glancing as he did so through
                  the window at the sun, which was already declining; and, abruptly turning to
                  Innis, said:</p>
               <p>"I have come to dine with you, and perhaps to spend the night."</p>
               <p>"Thanks, doctor," said Innis, who was pale, and spoke in a dull, apathetic voice.
                  "I am fortunate enough to be able to entertain you, and to provide for your horses
                  too. My old servant will see that the horses and driver want nothing."</p>
               <p>The young man went as he spoke into an adjoining room, through the door of which
                  Dr. Vandyke saw a neat bed; and, coming back in a few moments, said:</p>
               <p>"All will be attended to, doctor—there is old Ned showing the way to the stables;
                  and now, welcome again to my poor home. I had not expected to see you in so remote
                  a spot."</p>
               <p>"That's natural, and I am not quite sure of my own identity; but I believe the
                  individual who has the honor to address you is Dr. Julius Vandyke."</p>
               <p>"You were at Rivanna, no doubt, and took the fancy—"</p>
               <p>"Stop all that roundabout talk, my young friend," said the doctor, abruptly: "let
                  us throw ceremony to the dogs, and come to business. You are breaking your heart
                  about Honoria Brand—come, deny it, if you can!"</p>
               <p>An expression of great wretchedness came to the young man's face.</p>
               <p>"Who am I, to presume to look up to Miss Brand?" he said, bitterly.</p>
               <p>"You are a man—and a gentleman, too, if there is any difference! I say you are
                  making yourself unhappy about a girl, and I have come here to have a little talk
                  with you on that subject."</p>
               <p>Innis shook his head gloomily.</p>
               <p>"What good will come of it?" he said. "Let the ashes cover it—you know the warning
                  of the Latin poet: 'Do not disturb the ashes that conceal the hidden fire.'"</p>
               <p>"I know a little Latin, but I choose to think and resolve for myself. I mean to
                  talk about this affair—to talk to my heart's content! But I propose to dine first,
                  as I perceive the odor of that meal, and welcome it."</p>
               <p>The door opened as Dr. Vandyke spoke, and an old family servant with gray hair,
                  and a profoundly deferential bearing, made his appearance, and proceeded to set
                  the table. He then disappeared, but soon served dinner, which was plain but
                  appetizing. As the host and his guest sat down, a knock was heard at the outer
                  door; the doctor's driver appeared with a leather-covered case, and this case the
                  doctor at once opened, producing a brace of heavy, square bottles, through whose
                  transparent sides a ruby-colored liquid was seen to agitate itself, as the bottles
                  were deposited on the table.</p>
               <p>"Always travel with my liquor-case," said the doctor. "Rum—and superb!"</p>
               <p>He pushed the square bottle to Innis, who poured out some, but scarcely touched
                  the glass with his lips.</p>
               <p>"Come! drink—eat!" cried Dr. Vandyke, with his mouth full of ham.</p>
               <p>"I have no appetite to-day, doctor," was the reply.</p>
               <p>"And had none yesterday, I'd be willing to swear. Such is the effect of this
                  abominable love-business."</p>
               <p>The doctor continued to growl throughout the repast, in which Innis rather
                  affected to join than took any real part; and in due time the cloth was removed,
                  and host and guest drew their chairs to the fire.</p>
               <p>"This is comfortable," said Dr. Vandyke, leaning forward and rubbing his knees,
                  with a glance through the window at the sun, about to disappear behind the
                  mountain. "Snow a foot deep without, but a good fire within of hickory-logs that
                  warms one through and through! Hear the wind, how it howls! Faith! I'll brew a
                  bowl of punch to crown the victory over Boreas, and we'll make a night of it!"</p>
               <p>As he spoke, the doctor rose and pounced upon a great bowl of porcelain on the
                  sideboard; at the same moment the old major-domo appeared with a japanned waiter
                  containing a silver coffee-pot, and some small cups of exquisitely thin china,
                  richly colored.</p>
               <p>"Coffee!" cried the doctor; "how now, then Sybarite! But if coffee—then hot water!
                  Some hot water, my aged friend; I see before me the sugar!"</p>
               <p>With profound deference the old servant brought in hot water; the doctor proceeded
                  to brew the punch, which he subsequently dealt out with a silver ladle; and,
                  having informed his host that he preferred firelight to candles, the eccentric
                  guest resumed his arm-chair before the fire, rubbed his legs with an air of
                  enjoyment, and said:</p>
               <p>"I beg to offer a toast! To our common and highly-esteemed friend the most
                  excellent lady, who once came near espousing the amiable Julius Vandyke!"</p>
               <p>With these words, the amiable Julius Vandyke raised his ponderous feet, placed
                  them upon the cross-piece of his chair, elevated thus his knees very nearly to the
                  level of his eyes, and, leaning his head back, swallowed his glass of punch at one
                  gulp. Innis had never lost his apathetic expression. He now said:</p>
               <p>"The lady you were near espousing once, doctor?"</p>
               <p>"Lady Brand."</p>
               <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6141-00000056"/>
               <p>"Ah! You were once an admirer of my aunt?"</p>
               <p>"At least I asked her to marry me, in this very room."</p>
               <p>"In this room?"</p>
               <p>"Hold! She was sitting yonder. The sun was setting, and the shadow of the crooked
                  pine-tree there was thrown upon the face of the old clock. It was half-past six in
                  the evening, I remember."</p>
               <p>Innis looked at the eccentric being before him, who was now clasping his arms
                  around his drawn-up knees.</p>
               <p>"You surprise me, doctor," he said. "I did know—"</p>
               <p>"That this house was familiar to me? Perfectly; and, as we have plenty of time
                  to-night, suppose I tell you a little of what the poets would call the 'romance of
                  my existence?'"</p>
               <p>Innis inclined his head; and, refilling his glass with a bacchanalian air, Dr.
                  Vandyke said:</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>XLVI. THE ROMANCE OF DR. VANDYKE.</head>
               <p>"I AM, correctly speaking, not Dr. Vandyke, but the Baron Julius von Dyke, a
                  German by birth, and belonging to a family whose representatives held important
                  commands in the armies of the Emperor Charles V. As I am a person, however, of
                  democratical opinions, I do not value the <emph>von</emph> in my name a farthing,
                  and will sell you my patent of baron for sixpence. I will not enlarge upon the
                  former importance of my family, which, in time, grew poorer—then poorer—then
                  landless. Whereupon the baron, my father, went to London; was induced to emigrate
                  to Virginia; brought me, his only son, with him; and died, leaving me at
                  twenty-five possessed of a small, a very small, estate, but, what was better, an
                  education as a physician, the result of study at Göttingen.</p>
               <p>"Well, when my father died, I found myself quite alone, and did not much relish
                  the lonely life of a country physician in Charles City, where my small estate lay;
                  so I disposed of the land, removed to Williamsburg, and announced that I was ready
                  to administer pills and draughts to the inhabitants of that thriving capital.</p>
               <p>"My success was not encouraging. The children ran behind their mother's dresses
                  when I made my appearance; and once or twice it was intimated to me that, in
                  certain cases connected with one branch of the leech's art, my personal appearance
                  was calculated to produce unfortunate results. In fact, my young friend, I was
                  hideously ugly—as ugly as I am at this moment, or very nearly—and, in consequence
                  thereof, there was nothing in the world that I admired so much as personal beauty.
                  This became, at last, almost a mania with me, and I would place myself at the
                  window of my poor lodgings on Gloucester Street—a small room on the second floor
                  of a small house—that which you one day entered with me—and, from this elevated
                  perch, I would watch the passers-by on the street, riveting my eyes, with a
                  passionate, craving admiration on the beautiful forms moving to and fro before me.
                  Not a white, bending neck, seen beneath a blue scarf, not a slender foot with
                  arched instep in its high-heeled shoe, or graceful figure, undulating as it moved
                  on, but filled me with delight and admiration. And—not with that material
                  sentiment which you might imagine—all was etherealized for me; beauty was poetry,
                  and I enjoyed this beauty as a painter enjoys the beauty of a summer day, when
                  white clouds float against a blue sky, over emerald fields and forests!"</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke stopped, to utter a short, grating laugh.</p>
               <p>"Poetical, you see, my young friend. Try the punch! No? Well, to go on with my
                  romantic narrative: My greatest misfortune was to have inherited a mirror which
                  afforded me a full-length view of my own exquisite proportions. This mirror was
                  fixed against the wall between the windows of my lodging, and I had only to turn
                  my head to see my own image. I did turn my head often, and chiefly after following
                  with my eyes some handsome young cavalier on his prancing steed—some radiant young
                  Apollo, with gracefully-fashioned figure, slender, erect, and elegant, straight
                  limbs, rounded where they pressed against the saddle, attractive features,
                  chestnut curls—some young Adonis, in a word, compared with whom I was a satyr of
                  waste places—a monster. For, what did I behold in that fatal mirror? A being
                  scarcely human. <emph>A thing,</emph> let us say, about four feet and a half in
                  height, splay-footed, thin-legged, with enormous chest, the arms of a windmill, a
                  head like a pumpkin, sunken eyes, wide mouth, no neck—a fearful, frightful
                     <foreign xml:lang="LAT">lusus naturæ,</foreign> sent into the world to appall
                  children, and make the dogs bark—ha! ha!</p>
               <p>"Well, things went on thus for years, when one day I made the acquaintance of two
                  young ladies on a visit to the capital: one was afterward your mother, the other
                  your aunt. It was your aunt I fell in love with, and this came about in an
                  accidental manner—if there be any accidents in the world. Colonel Seaton, the
                  uncle of the young ladies, was addicted to high living, and, one day, on returning
                  from a grand dinner, he was taken with an indigestion, which was near putting an
                  end to him. The most prominent physician in the capital was sent for in great
                  haste, but was absent. The consequence was, that I was called in to attend Colonel
                  Seaton, and succeeded in relieving him so expeditiously that he conceived a high
                  opinion of my abilities and invited me to visit at his house as a friend. This
                  offer I gladly accepted; and, as Colonel Seaton had known my father, the baron, I
                  soon became a familiar friend of the family, and—fell in love with your aunt, Lady
                  Brand."</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke stopped suddenly, and plunging his hand into the capacious pocket of
                  his great-coat, which he persisted in keeping on, drew forth a huge pipe and a
                  handful of tobacco.</p>
               <p>"It is an extraordinary evidence of absent-mindedness in me to have forgotten my
                  pipe," he said. "Is the world coming to an end? Come, sweetest solace, come!"</p>
               <p>And, grinning amiably, the doctor filled the great bowl, picked up a coal with the
                  tongs, lit his pipe, and began to puff out clouds of snowy smoke.</p>
               <p>"You won't smoke? No? Well, to continue my interesting narrative: Where did I
                  stop? Oh, at the commencement of my charming little romance—what I call,
                  elegantly, 'the romance of Dr. Vandyke'—my love-affair with the young beauty from
                  the mountains—from Rivanna, in a word."</p>
               <p>And the doctor darted a keen glance at Innis, who remained cold and apathetic.</p>
               <p>"'Twas an absolute passion I conceived for the young lady," said the doctor,
                  smoking away in the most nonchalant manner, "and, after all, my young friend,
                  there is nothing so strong as what is called <emph>love.</emph> Nothing hurts, for
                  a short time, like disappointment therein! I will not enlarge upon the charming
                  details of my affair, but will state what may appear to you, since it so appears
                  to me, an astounding circumstance—the fact that the lady of my affections was not
                  wholly unkind nor cold to her admirer, the present narrator. Ellen—you call her
                  Aunt Ellen now, but she was then a blooming beauty, too youthful for auntship—was
                  touched, it seems, by the devotion of the poor physician who evidently adored her.
                  She blushed when<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6141-00000057"/> Splay-foot entered:
                  actually faltered in her address when she spoke to Blear-eyes: and, one day, the
                  presumptuous Wide-mouth said, 'I love you!'—at which she no more shrunk than she
                  would have shrunk from an Adonis! Can you believe that? I remember without
                  believing it! And at that moment I tasted the first moment of real happiness I had
                  tasted in the world! Then the poor, deformed dwarf was a human being after
                  all!—the monster was not so hideous and repulsive as he had dreamed!—after all, he
                  was a man, belonged to <emph>mankind,</emph> was not an ape, a wild-man of the
                  woods, an object of disgust or horror. When I took her hand in my own she did not
                  shudder or grow sick!—then she had seen that behind this mask was a heart and a
                  brain—felt that the brain thought, and the heart throbbed; and her own heart
                  melted—was nearly my own, I think!"</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke terminated this sentence with a grin, and, smoking with great <foreign
                     xml:lang="ITA">gusto,</foreign> said:</p>
               <p>"I am growing a little tired of this part of my subject, but nothing is so
                  seductive as this analytical exposition of human nature under peculiar phases. You
                  see, my dear friend, I am proceeding exactly as I proceed when a subject—a dead
                  body, that is—is lying on a table before me, and I have the scalped in my hand. I
                  dissect a heart as I dissect a body. Well, what is the lesson that is sought to be
                  demonstrated in the present lecture, my youthful friends—friend, that is? Why,
                  that a deformed dwarf has actually a heart, feelings, passions, and that a woman
                  can understand as much, and see <emph>the man</emph> through the hideous
                     <emph>mask!</emph> To proceed. The romance is nearly ended. An interruption
                  took place on that eventful morning, and the ladies left Williamsburg almost
                  immediately. I did not see them again for some years. Then your mother had married
                  your father—they came to this house to live—and, visiting Williamsburg once, Mrs.
                  Innis invited me to come and see them, as an old friend, in their mountain-home. I
                  did so, for my old romance remained untouched—and here I found your aunt. Shall I
                  continue? I offered her my hand in this apartment. She did not reply either 'Yes'
                  or 'No;' I was forced to return to the capital—and a year afterward she was Lady
                  Brand. All that came about in the most natural way. Colonel Seaton brought the
                  young lady to Williamsburg. She there met Colonel Brand. Her uncle, her friends,
                  everybody, said, 'Marry him,' and she finally did so, caring for him, as I happen
                  to know, not a fig! I <emph>saw</emph> that at a glance; and what did I do, my
                  friend? I said to her: 'If you should ever require the aid of a true friend, send
                  for me, and I will come to you, either by day or by night;' and then I went back
                  to my duties, and forgot all about my romance, and don't care a farthing now for
                  her beyond mere friendship, nor regret that she married my rival!</p>
               <p>"There's your pretty little romance, my boy!" said the doctor, laughing; "love,
                  nay, passion!—disappointment, anguish, indifference, oblivion! That's the course
                  of things in this curious world. You break your heart about a woman to-day, and in
                  half a year you have forgotten her! Every thing changes, my son—nothing remains
                  the same! Do you think that time, that wears away the very Pyramids, don't wear
                  away human grief? The grief is the easier of the two, I assure you! Eternal
                  despair!—nonsense! A year is not an eternity! Come! let us cease this philosophic
                  strain! Drink me this glass of punch—'tis imperial! <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Vive
                     la joie!</foreign> and let dull care begone!"</p>
               <p>The doctor imbibed a huge mouthful of punch; refilled his glass; mounted with
                  great agility into his chair, from which he stepped to the table, and, raising his
                  arm until it nearly touched the ceiling, cried:</p>
               <p>"A health to Oblivion—the last, best friend of humanity!"</p>
               <p>At an hour past midnight, Dr. Vandyke was shown to bed by his host; and anybody
                  who had looked at him would have seen upon his countenance an expression of
                  unmistakable disappointment.</p>
               <p>In reply to his narrative, Innis had only said, with the same dull, apathetic
                  look:</p>
               <p>"I said when you came, doctor, that I regarded you as one of my best friends—well,
                  your history has more than ever convinced me of the fact. You relate your own
                  disappointment, to impress upon <emph>me</emph> the moral that grief wears away,
                  and indifference comes. So be it. I trust 'twill come! But I shall none the less
                  leave this house and Virginia, in two days from this time, never to return. My
                  house is sold, my valise is already packed—it is my great good fortune, as I turn
                  my back forever on Virginia, to have heard your friendly voice, doctor.
                  Good-night!"</p>
               <p>On the next morning, Dr. Vandyke returned to Williamsburg.</p>

               <head>XLVII. HALLUCINATION.</head>
               <p>A WEEK after these events, Lord Ruthven was seated in an arm-chair, in his
                  lodgings at Williamsburg, wrapped in his dressing-gown of figured silk. In a chair
                  opposite sat Dr. Vandyke, whose eyes were fixed upon his patient.</p>
               <p>Ruthven was fearfully thin and pale. His frame seemed to have dwindled away; and
                  his eyes had that dreamy, wandering expression which indicates the want of
                  physical energy under the hand of disease.</p>
               <p>"So you think I shall recover now, doctor?" he said, in a low voice.</p>
               <p>"Unless you have a relapse, which, to be frank with you, is apt to prove fatal,"
                  was the reply.</p>
               <p>Ruthven inclined his head.</p>
               <p>"I like frankness, doctor. I have had a dangerous attack, have I not?"</p>
               <p>"Very dangerous."</p>
               <p>"You have not yet given me your opinion of my case—I should say, have not
                  explained its nature, and I should be glad to know now the character of the
                  disease which has just assailed me."</p>
               <p>"Do you wish the scientific or the familiar definition; that is to say, jargon or
                  intelligible statement?"</p>
               <p>"The familiar definition, doctor.—What has been the cause of my illness?"</p>
               <p>"Nervous prostration."</p>
               <p>Ruthven nodded.</p>
               <p>"Your view coincides with my own. And to what was this prostration of the nervous
                  system due; to physical or to mental causes?"</p>
               <p>"Do you wish a plain statement of your case? I hate beating round the bush," said
                  Dr. Vandyke, in his vibrating and metallic voice.</p>
               <p>"A plain statement, by all means, sir."</p>
               <p>"Listen, then, my Lord Ruthven. Men of your organization and habits never undergo
                  nervous prostration from physical causes. Drunkards, <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >roués,</foreign> and others, have attacks of that description. You are neither
                  a drunkard nor a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">roué;</foreign> thus the cause of disease
                  is to be sought elsewhere; and I may as well inform you that I have not had long
                  to seek. You have been ill, very ill, in consequence of mental excitement, which,
                  reacting, as every thing does, on the body, has brought the physical system in
                  sympathy with the mental condition—that is, made you ill. Beyond this; I see no
                  necessity to go."</p>
               <p>"And yet you have gone further?"</p>
               <p>The eyes of the two men met.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Dr. Vandyke, coolly.</p>
               <p>"You have discovered the source of my mental excitement."</p>
               <pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6141-00000058"/>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"What is it?"</p>
               <p>"You wish me to speak plainly?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—yes."</p>
               <p>"Well, I employ the scientific term now. You have been the victim of
                     <emph>hallucination.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"The plainer term for which is—?"</p>
               <p>Ruthven looked with sudden intensity at the physician.</p>
               <p>"Second sight," said Dr. Vandyke.</p>
               <p>Ruthven uttered a low groan, and closed his eyes as though he were about to
                  faint.</p>
               <p>"Your—meaning?" he murmured.</p>
               <p>"I mean nothing—a mere jest," said Dr. Vandyke; "here, a few drops of this
                  cordial?"</p>
               <p>"No, doctor," said Ruthven, sitting erect in his chair, and speaking in a firm
                  voice. "I do not need it, and am stronger, I think, than you suppose. You would
                  turn the conversation, I see, but do not fear—the topic does not agitate me."</p>
               <p>He remained lost in thought for some moments; then he said:</p>
               <p>"I was not aware that you had turned your attention to a subject which few
                  thinkers regard as worthy of their serious attention. Then you believe—in the
                  superstition, as the world calls it, of—second sight?"</p>
               <p>He uttered the last words only after a moment's hesitation, and with evident
                  repugnance.</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke looked fixedly at him, and said:</p>
               <p>"<emph>Believe in</emph> is a phrase which means much or little. If you tell me
                  that you have seen a ghost and felt the breath of the grave issue from the
                  phantom, I believe in the ghost—as far as it concerns yourself."</p>
               <p>"Well, well," was Ruthven's impatient exclamation, "but that is no reply. I ask if
                  you <emph>believe</emph> that—"</p>
               <p>"Human beings in the island of Skye and in parts of Scotland fall into trances,
                  and see the future? Yes—I believe that they believe it."</p>
               <p>"Then you do <emph>not</emph> believe it?" Lord Ruthven murmured.</p>
               <p>"I believe in science, and science defines hallucination as plainly as it defines
                  any other, the most rational operation of the human brain."</p>
               <p>"We drop logic and fence with words, sir," said Ruthven, impatiently. "You plainly
                  have no faith in this—second sight," again he paused before the words; "but
                  suppose I were to tell you that I know persons—in my own family—who possess the
                  fearful gift?"</p>
               <p>"Yourself, that is to say," said Dr. Vandyke. "I know very well that second sight
                  is hereditary, or people think so, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">ut
                  ante</foreign>—otherwise I should not have said, 'Your nervous prostration is due
                  to this cause.' Am I wrong?"</p>
               <p>"You have divined rightly."</p>
               <p>The words were uttered in an almost sepulchral whisper.</p>
               <p>"Yes," continued Lord Ruthven, gloomily, "my family has for two hundred years been
                  the victim of this frightful faculty. They have seen, in vision, the events that
                  are to come—the faces, the figures, the scenes, have all passed before them. And
                  the scenes of my future have passed before <emph>me!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"My lord!" said Dr. Vandyke.</p>
               <p>"Sir!"</p>
               <p>"You will have the goodness, if you please, to stop this sort of talk. I consented
                  to discuss with you this scientific question, but had no design to bring on a
                  second attack of nervous illness. In an evil moment I uttered the words,
                  'hallucination' and 'second sight.' I am sorry I did so, and it was a waste of
                  time, too, for I now inform you frankly that your 'second-sight' business is all
                  flummery—moonshine."</p>
               <p>"You think so?" came in a low voice from Ruthven's pale lips. "Well, so be it,
                  sir."</p>
               <p>"I know it! All froth and devil's deception! Let the thought alone! It will madden
                  you! Buy a fiddle, and drink rum, and go and dance a dozen reels—there's your
                  philosophic proceeding—and let these chimeras rest in congenial darkness."</p>
               <p>Lord Ruthven bowed with calm courtesy, and said, coolly:</p>
               <p>"I thank you for your advice, doctor, and acknowledge that it is sound. And, now
                  let us have done with this rather melancholy subject, which I had no design to
                  discuss, and was betrayed into, before becoming aware of the fact. What is my
                  condition—when shall I recover?"</p>
               <p>"Speedily, if you have no relapse."</p>
               <p>"I shall be able to—travel, say—in my coach—in a week?"</p>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>"In two weeks?"</p>
               <p>"Possibly."</p>
               <p>"Thanks, sir. That will serve my purpose."</p>
               <p>"If you take my advice," growled Dr. Vandyke, "you will put off this travelling
                  for a month."</p>
               <p>"That is impracticable, doctor, for reasons it is needless to detail."</p>
               <p>"Right—I know them. You are going to Rivanna to marry Honoria Brand."</p>
               <p>"Yes, doctor—I see that you are acquainted with my private affairs."</p>
               <p>"Perfectly; and, perhaps, I know some circumstances unknown to yourself."</p>
               <p>"Unknown?"</p>
               <p>"Do you know that Honoria Brand loves her cousin, Edmund Innis?"</p>
               <p>A cloud passed across Ruthven's brow, and his eyes grew cold and haughty.</p>
               <p>"I knew at least that Mr. Innis did the future Countess of Ruthven the honor to
                  bestow his affections upon <emph>her.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"And this mutual attachment—for it is mutual—is no obstacle in your eyes?"</p>
               <p>"An obstacle? No! A cause of displeasure? Yes!"</p>
               <p>"Why, then—"</p>
               <p>"Persist in the offer of my hand, sir? For the very simple reason that marriage is
                  not silly romance. This is better understood in Europe than in Virginia, sir! Do
                  you fancy that in Europe young ladies neglect to enjoy their private romance?
                  Everywhere they do so; but they form alliances, sir, upon solider
                  foundations!"</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke listened to these words in gloomy silence.</p>
               <p>"Well," he muttered, "'tis no affair of mine; I have done all I could, and this
                  one is like the other at Rivanna."</p>
               <p>Having solaced himself with this growl, Dr. Vandyke rose.</p>
               <p>"If she can't stand up, that will end it!" he added, in the same tone.</p>
               <p>He turned to Lord Ruthven.</p>
               <p>"You are doing well now, and need me no further," he said. "Good-day, sir."</p>
               <p>Before Lord Ruthven could reply he had left the room.</p>

               <head>XLVIII. WHAT OCCURRED AT THE WEDDING-DINNER.</head>
               <p>THE morning of the day fixed on for Honoria's marriage came at last. All night the
                  snow had been falling—the fields, forests, and mountains, were enveloped in a
                  white shroud—and now, when the storm had ceased, a freezing wind had succeeded,
                  howling around the gables and in the spectral trees, and driving the light snow
                  before it in blinding gusts.</p>
               <p>Despite, however, the forbidding nature of the weather, the wedding-guests began
                  to arrive at an early hour, curious to witness the ceremony of the wedding of a
                  young lady of the quiet country neighborhood with a real nobleman.<pb n="110-111"
                     xml:id="VAC6141-00000059"/> The invitations had been almost universal—no one
                  with the slightest pretensions to good society having been omitted; but there had
                  been a species of distinction made by the proud Colonel Brand. While a countless
                  number were invited, as we now say, to "the ceremony," which was to take place at
                  night, invitations to dinner had been confined to a select few of the most
                  prominent personages of the vicinity. These now arrived; but unfortunately, as the
                  reader will perceive, there mingled with them some others, who, liberally
                  regarding an invitation as an invitation, made their appearance in the forenoon,
                  bent on dinner.</p>
               <p>Colonel Brand received every guest, however, with the formal politeness habitual
                  with him; and general conversation ensued in the great drawing-room, where the
                  motley throng warmed their chilled limbs before the mighty fire of roaring
                  hickory. As yet, the ladies had not made their appearance, and the company
                  separated itself into groups instinctively—the grand old nabobs, in powdered wigs,
                  silk stockings, and ruffles, conversing, <foreign xml:lang="LAT">ore
                     rotundo,</foreign> with stately dignity, to themselves; the plainer planters,
                  with waistcoats buttoned to their chins, and hair tied in plain knots behind,
                  mean-while exchanging in a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">coterie,</foreign> some feet
                  distant, observations on the approaching ceremony.</p>
               <p>As the forenoon passed on, guests continued to gather, and at last a movement of
                  all heads in the direction of the window indicated the arrival of a personage of
                  importance.</p>
               <p>This personage proved to be Lord Ruthven. He descended, wrapped in heavy furs,
                  from his chariot, whose four horses were smoking and covered with foam, from the
                  rapidity of the arduous journey through the snow, and entered the mansion, on the
                  threshold of which Colonel Brand was ready to receive him.</p>
               <p>"Welcome to Rivanna, my lord!" said the colonel, with stately dignity, and bowing
                  low, as, with outstretched hand, he greeted the bridegroom. "I had hoped for your
                  earlier arrival, but the roads are, no doubt, most difficult."</p>
               <p>Lord Ruthven bowed low in turn, uttered a few words in response to his host's
                  greeting, and was ushered into the drawing-room where the assembled company was
                  presented to him, one after another. He replied, in every instance, by a simple
                  bow, and seemed entirely unaware of the fact that he was the centre of all eyes.
                  All were struck with his pallor, and the settled gloom of his expression; and it
                  was afterward remembered that, as he entered the room, he had looked around him in
                  a most singular manner, growing paler than before. Another unusual circumstance
                  also attracted attention. When, after the general introduction, some one spoke to
                  him, he would suddenly rouse himself with a start from his species of reverie,
                  gaze with a fearful expression at the speaker, and, even while replying in a few
                  brief and constrained words, would glance over his right shoulder in a very
                  unaccountable manner, as though he suspected the presence of some danger, against
                  which it was necessary for him to be upon his guard.</p>
               <p>It was impossible that these very unusual circumstances, in connection with Lord
                  Ruthven's appearance and demeanor, should not excite surprise, and occasion
                  subsequent comment, on the part of the guests; but his lordship was quickly shown
                  to his chamber, whither the silent and attentive Fergus had seen his
                  travelling-trunks borne, and the door of the drawing-room closed abruptly,
                  erecting an impassable barrier between the pale nobleman and the curious
                  company.</p>
               <p>Nearly two hours then passed, when the door opened, and Lord Ruthven was again
                  ushered in by the stately Colonel Brand. He had changed his travelling-dress, and
                  had donned a dark costume of the richest and most elegant description. It was
                  impossible not to be struck by his air of high breeding and distinction; but, as
                  before, it was the singular face of the young nobleman which riveted all eyes. He
                  was, if possible, paler than ever, and entered the room in sepulchral silence—a
                  walking shadow. During the few moments which followed his entry he did not utter a
                  word, but stood like a statue amid the crowd of guests, who unconsciously drew
                  back.</p>
               <p>The appearance of the ladies afforded a welcome diversion. Lady Brand, accompanied
                  by her daughters and her lady-guests, entered, and greeted her visitors. But she
                  attracted attention for an instant only. All eyes were fixed upon Honoria, who was
                  as pale as Lord Ruthven, and who resembled, in her white dress and with her whiter
                  cheeks, a ghost, rather than a human being.</p>
               <p>Lord Ruthven had advanced quickly and bowed low, with stately courtesy, over the
                  hands which Lady Brand and the young ladies held out. Honoria's was extended
                  toward him in an abrupt and convulsive manner, and he found it as cold as ice. For
                  an instant their eyes met—the sunken eyes of the girl wore a strange
                  expression—but she preserved her self-possession, seemed unconscious of the
                  scrutiny to which she was subjected, and seemed to regard with apathetic
                  indifference the whole scene around her.</p>
               <p>Everybody felt relieved when the door opened, and the old, gray-haired major-domo,
                  Robin, with a silver waiter under his arm, looked respectfully toward Colonel
                  Brand, thus announcing that dinner was served.</p>
               <p>Lord Ruthven offered his arm to Lady Brand, who stood near him; the company
                  entered the great dining-room, blazing with lights in silver candelabra—for night
                  was near—and took their seats at the broad board whose rich blue china and old
                  plate sparkled in the flood of light.</p>
               <p>The grand dinner went on its way in a stiff and stately manner, little relieved by
                  conversation. Honoria sustained the glances of all without change in her apathetic
                  expression, and sent away course after course nearly untasted. The only indication
                  of her feelings was her frightful pallor; and this became at times so unnatural
                  that Lady Brand was, more than once, upon the point of rising, and leading her
                  from the room, under the apprehension that she was about to faint. Nothing, for
                  some time, however, occurred to mar the festivity—if such it could be called. On
                  the contrary, the stiffness of the scene gradually gave way before the rich wines;
                  the awe felt for the ceremonious Colonel Brand, by a portion of the company,
                  melted, and the dinner promised to terminate more cheerfully and cordially than it
                  had commenced.</p>
               <p>But the fates were adverse. The heady wines had done their work. Ceremony was lost
                  sight of by some of the honest old fellows who had construed their general
                  invitation to the wedding, into an invitation to the wedding <emph>and
                     dinner;</emph> and two of these old neighbors now began to discuss the
                  approaching ceremony.</p>
               <p>The conversation of these worthy country gentlemen, now warmed by the colonel's
                  canary, was not precise or formal, as will be seen; and a portion of it will
                  account for what followed.</p>
               <p>"Strange enough," said one of them to his old neighbor. "And beats the story-books
                  all hollow, eh?"</p>
               <p>"All hollow," replied his friend.</p>
               <p>"It was honorable in our friend Brand, though, to record it in the court of
                  probate," continued the first speaker. "If what they say is true, young Innis tore
                  up the will, and swore he wouldn't take the property."</p>
               <p>"Did he do that?"</p>
               <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6141-00000060"/>
               <p>"I'm told so, and it's like his father's son; his father was as honest a gentleman
                  as ever hunted a fox."</p>
               <p>"A gentleman before he was born! So Ned Innis tore up the will?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, neighbor, and they say it was all on account of the boy's love for little
                  Miss Honoria; and if so, I say it's a thousand pities <emph>he</emph> can't get
                  her instead of this 'my lord,' who looks like a block of ice, with a handful of
                  snow for a face!"</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha! That's good, neighbor! A block of ice, ha! ha! A good thing! Yes, it's a
                  thousand pities!"</p>
               <p>"And I'm told—hold your ear close, neighbor."</p>
               <p>"Yes—"</p>
               <p>And the other drew nearer.</p>
               <p>"I'm told the little lady loves him better—a thousand times better—than her fine
                  lord and master to be."</p>
               <p>"Loves Ned Innis?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"That's a pity—a sad pity, neighbor. <emph>Loves</emph> the boy, did you say?"</p>
               <p>"Better than she loves herself. I drink your health, neighbor."</p>
               <p>"Your good health! So this match is hard on her."</p>
               <p>"Look at her; you can see that it is killing her!"</p>
               <p>"So it is—hum! hum!"</p>
               <p>"Such cheeks! Was any thing ever as white?"</p>
               <p>"As white as a sheet."</p>
               <p>"Look! I think she's going to faint. There is Lady Brand getting up to take her
                  out of the room!"</p>
               <p>"Yes—no! She is down again. A sad business, neighbor—a sad business."</p>
               <p>And, overcome by grief, the worthy gentleman poured out a large glass of canary,
                  passing the decanter to his neighbor, who imitated him. In the half an hour which
                  followed, this ceremony was repeated several times, and the worthies began to talk
                  thick.</p>
               <p>"And this will you told me of—where did they find it?"</p>
               <p>"In a desk where Colonel Seaton kept his private papers."</p>
               <p>"You are wrong there, sir," suddenly exclaimed a red-faced worthy next to the
                  speaker. He had evidently partaken in large quantities of the canary, and spoke
                  fiercely. "You are wrong! The will was found in a chest of drawers—not a
                  desk."</p>
               <p>"<emph>You</emph> are wrong, sir! 'Twas a desk!" was the retort of the first
                  speaker.</p>
               <p>"I am <emph>not</emph> wrong, sir!" exclaimed the other, with drunken severity,
                  "and I am not in the habit of stating what I don't know—do you hear, sir? If you
                  doubt my word, sir, I'll soon show you whether I'm talking sense!"</p>
               <p>And, raising his voice to a pitch which drowned the conversation of the rest of
                  the company, the red-faced speaker called out:</p>
               <p>"Colonel Brand!"</p>
               <p>The words rang out clearly, and instantly attracted everybody's eyes toward him
                  who uttered them. The colonel, who was at the moment uttering a ceremonious
                  compliment to a dowager seated on his left, suddenly turned his head, and frowned
                  slightly.</p>
               <p>"Colonel Brand! I say, Colonel Brand!" came again from the impatient worthy.</p>
               <p>"Did you address me, sir?" said the host, with crushing dignity.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir! I did. My word has been doubted, and I call on you to say if I know
                  what I'm talking about or not!"</p>
               <p>Colonel Brand scowled at the rudeness of the speaker.</p>
               <p>"Being ignorant of the subject of your conversation, sir," he said, "I am
                  naturally unable to afford you the information which you are good enough to demand
                  so loudly of me, sir!"</p>
               <p>But the colonel's interlocutor was beyond the point where <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >hauteur</foreign> makes any impression. The worthy only comprehended prehended
                  that Colonel Brand meant to ask information, and cried:</p>
               <p>"I said that old Colonel Seaton's will—his <emph>last</emph> will in favor of
                  young Innis's mother—was found in a chest of drawers, and not in a desk. This
                  statement," added the worthy with drunken dignity, "has been doubted!—and I call
                  on you to say if I know what I'm talking about!"</p>
               <p>Colonel Brand felt the blood rush to his face, and an angry shot from his eyes. He
                  controlled his rising wrath, however, and replied with intense <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">hauteur:</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>"I should prefer not discussing my private affairs at the dinner-table, sir!"</p>
               <p>"Well, that's just as you choose!" was the reply of the red-faced guest, whose
                  wrath rose to meet that of his host. "You can talk or not talk, just as you like,
                  but I say that the will was found in a chest of drawers; and, moreover, that young
                  Innis was a fool to tear it up, and let you have his property!"</p>
               <p>"Sir!" gasped the colonel, flushing crimson and glaring at the speaker, "are you
                  aware that you are in a gentleman's house!—at my table!—in the presence of
                  ladies!"</p>
               <p>"I know where I am!" growled the worthy, "and that—"</p>
               <p>"This is a vulgar intrusion, sir!—I—I—!"</p>
               <p>The colonel gasped for breath; but his ire flew off harmless from the
                  canary-heated guest.</p>
               <p>"Vulgar, am I?—an intruder, am I?" exclaimed that worthy; "and only because I say
                  what everybody is saying! I'm not to be frowned down, Colonel Brand, if you
                     <emph>are</emph> marrying your daughter to a <emph>lord,</emph> who's no
                  better, in my opinion, than any other man!"</p>
               <p>"Will you—have the goodness—!"</p>
               <p>Colonel Brand began thus, and we are sorry to say, ended with a violent oath,
                  which produced no effect, however, on his valorous opponent.</p>
               <p>"Don't be swearing at me!" was the wrathful response. "I'm not your slave, sir! If
                  you only knew it, everybody has his opinion of your marrying your daughter against
                  her will to this foreigner, when she loves young Innis—he loves her too, and gives
                  up his whole property to the man who's come to take away his sweetheart!"</p>
               <p>A low cry followed the words, and Lady Brand caught Honoria in her arms. The girl
                  had fainted, and was borne from the apartment in the midst of a scene of the
                  utmost agitation and confusion. Above this scene towered the wrathful form of
                  Colonel Brand; and it is impossible to say what might have occurred, had not his
                  drunken opponent been borne almost forcibly from the room, and soon afterward to
                  his home.</p>
               <p>For some moments the colonel stood silent, flushed with rage, and drawing long
                  breaths. He was evidently struggling against his rage, and succeeded in
                  controlling himself. But the attention of all was more particularly directed to
                  Lord Ruthven. His expression was full of the deadliest menace, and he resembled a
                  tiger about to spring. Those who had looked at him during the utterance of the
                  vulgar insults of the drunken guest, said afterward that his hand had silently
                  glided to his side where the Highland dirk is generally suspended, and that his
                  glaring eyes betrayed a positive thirst for the offender's blood.</p>
               <p>Colonel Brand's voice all at once made itself heard in the turmoil. In stern and
                  gloomy tones, he said:</p>
               <p>"I pray those who have done me the honor to assemble at my board, to forget, if
                  possible, this offensive intrusion of this vulgar person. Such accidents must
                  occur, when persons unfamiliar with the commonest rules of good-breeding, are
                  invited to mingle in the society of gentlemen. I disdain to reply to this man's
                  insults; and Mr. Innis—my young friend and kinsman, now undisputed owner<pb
                     n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6141-00000061"/> er of the lands of Rivanna—would be the
                  first to express his disgust at this vulgar insolence!"</p>
               <p>The colonel resumed his seat, and the dinner went on its way, but the festivity
                  was all hushed. The meal ended in ominous silence, and the company rose and
                  returned to the drawing-room.</p>
               <p>At the same moment the great hall-door was thrown open. A newly-arrived personage,
                  wrapped in a huge cloak, stamped to cleanse the snow from his feet—and this
                  personage, coming into the circle of light, revealed the squat and powerful
                  figure, the long, gray hair, and piercing eyes of Dr. Vandyke.</p>

               <head>XLIX. THE CONTENTS OF RUTHVEN'S TRUNKS.</head>
               <p>AS Lord Ruthven passed Dr. Vandyke, on his way to the drawing-room, their eyes
                  met, and the young nobleman, going close to him, said, in a low voice, quite
                  inaudible to the rest of the company:</p>
               <p>"I wish to have a few moments' private conversation with you, doctor."</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke's piercing glance seemed to aim at penetrating the design of the
                  speaker: but Ruthven remained calm and impressive.</p>
               <p>"When?" said Dr. Vandyke.</p>
               <p>"In half an hour."</p>
               <p>"Where?"</p>
               <p>"In my chamber."</p>
               <p>The physician nodded.</p>
               <p>"I will come thither; but will first go see Lady Brand and the child, Meta. I came
                  for that."</p>
               <p>With these words, Dr. Vandyke bestowed a comprehensive nod upon the company, who
                  gazed at his singular figure with some astonishment, and proceeded, without
                  ceremony, toward the wing of the mansion, in which Meta's chamber was
                  situated.</p>
               <p>Colonel Brand, who had greeted the doctor with a stately bow, looked after him,
                  and now said:</p>
               <p>"Our friend Dr. Vandyke is a somewhat singular personage, my lord."</p>
               <p>"But a most estimable person," returned Ruthven.</p>
               <p>"Assuredly; and I owe him my personal thanks for coming through such weather to
                  see Meta."</p>
               <p>"She is better, I trust, sir?"</p>
               <p>"We hope so."</p>
               <p>"'Tis a pleasing augury, on an occasion of this description," said Ruthven; "and
                  now, with your permission, sir, I will retire to my chamber for a short
                  space."</p>
               <p>Colonel Brand bowed.</p>
               <p>"I will conduct you, my lord."</p>
               <p>"'Tis unnecessary. Let me not take you from your guests."</p>
               <p>And, with a gesture of courteous refusal, Lord Ruthven went up the great staircase
                  toward his chamber.</p>
               <p>As he entered he saw Fergus standing with his back toward him, gazing upon a
                  portrait upon the wall between two of the lofty windows. The apartment was
                  elegantly furnished with what is now called an "ashes-of-roses" carpet, a
                  centre-table of carved oak, easy-chairs, a couch, an immense bed, and in the
                  fireplace burned a cheerful fire.</p>
               <p>For the moment, Fergus seemed quite unaware of all these surroundings. His eyes
                  were fixed upon the portrait with absorbing attention; and, looking in the same
                  direction, Lord Ruthven betrayed much astonishment. The portrait was an exact
                  likeness of himself, and this fact evidently astounded the old body-servant.
                  Ruthven speedily remembered, however, that Colonel Brand had informed him of the
                  existence of this portrait of the elder Lord Ruthven—which had been hung in this
                  apartment after its removal from Honoria's chamber—and he wondered that he had not
                  noticed it on his first entrance.</p>
               <p>"That is a striking likeness, Fergus," he said.</p>
               <p>The old body-servant suddenly turned round.</p>
               <p>"Is it a picture of the late lord or of your lordship?"</p>
               <p>"Of the late lord, who was Colonel Brand's friend."</p>
               <p>Fergus nodded.</p>
               <p>"'T would do for either, my lord, and is surprising."</p>
               <p>Ruthven stood for some time, gazing at the painting.</p>
               <p>"The sight of this picture takes me back to Ruthven Castle, when I was a child,
                  Fergus," he said; "and that seems a long time ago."</p>
               <p>"A very long time, my lord."</p>
               <p>"And who would then have dreamed that Fate would conduct me to this remote spot in
                  the Virginia mountains; that my errand here would be to find a Lady Ruthven; and
                  that, at the very moment when the ceremony is about to take place, I should see my
                  father, as it were, looking at me with his sad, stern eyes; for the eyes are very
                  sad, Fergus—full of melancholy, I think!"</p>
               <p>The words were uttered in a sorrowful voice, and Lord Ruthven's head drooped.</p>
               <p>"Strange destiny," he murmured; "and who can foretell his fate? Singular current
                  of events! That portrait was painted when the original was a strong and stalwart
                  man—I a rosy-checked child. He is long dead now—and I am no longer a happy child,
                  but a very sorrowful man, Fergus—sorrowful, but not bad, Fergus! I think there is
                  even much good in me, old friend. My—visions—have not disturbed me now for weeks—a
                  strange softness and kindness seem to have come to me! Shall I be happy, then? Has
                  my evil genius fled, to make way for the beneficent spirit of love and
                  happiness?"</p>
               <p>"Heaven grant it, my lord!" said Fergus, with earnest feeling.</p>
               <p>"Perchance 'tis you who are my good genius, Fergus," said Ruthven, with a glance
                  of affection. "You are devoted to me, I know, as few clansmen are to their
                  chieftains."</p>
               <p>"Devoted, my lord?" said the old man, with a flush in his aged cheeks; "that is
                  scarcely the word. You are more to me than I am to myself! Your happiness and
                  honor are no less, nay, more, my care than your own! I would guard them, as the
                  watch-dog guards his charge on the hills; and, 'tis not much to say that I would
                  die for you!"</p>
               <p>Fergus turned away to hide the emotion, of which he seemed to be somewhat ashamed,
                  and busied himself in taking from Lord Ruthven's trunks the various articles of
                  his wardrobe. Among these were two or three dress-swords—at that time a portion of
                  the full toilet of a gentleman—and these he laid upon the table. Next came a
                  number of articles of dress, and then a curiously-fashioned Highland dirk.</p>
               <p>At sight of this weapon, Ruthven approached, and said, gently:</p>
               <p>"Replace that dangerous-looking affair, Fergus; 'tis out of place on so happy an
                  occasion. Why was it brought?"</p>
               <p>"From habit, my lord. We Highlanders, you know, carry the dirk, as the Sassenach
                  wears his rapier. 'Tis from custom; and this came with the other things."</p>
               <p>"So be it; but hide it away—'twould fright some of the servants."</p>
               <p>"I will obey you, my lord."</p>
               <p>And Fergus replaced the grim-looking weapon in the trunk, where it lay, concealed
                  beneath an embroidered coat and the ruffled linen of its owner.</p>
               <p>"Your lordship will not change your dress?" said Fergus, when this ceremony had
                  been performed.</p>
               <p>"No, Fergus; I am, I believe, properly attired."</p>
               <p>At this same moment a knock came at the door.</p>
               <p>"Come in," said Ruthven.</p>

               <head>L. META AND HER PHYSICIAN.</head>
               <p>META was lying on a small couch beside the fire, in her little apartment in one of
                  the wings; and Lady Brand, who had succeeded in soothing Honoria's agitation, and
                  had intrusted her to the care of her bridesmaids, had come for a few moments to
                  see Meta before the ceremony. The child was very thin and white, and her black
                  hair, lying in profuse curls upon the snowy pillow, framed the sweet countenance,
                  lit up by a tender smile.</p>
               <p>Lady Brand was engaged in conversation with Meta, sighing deeply from time to
                  time, as she thought of Honoria, when steps were heard approaching. The door
                  suddenly opened, and a hearty voice cried:</p>
               <p>"Well, my little snow-drop, how are we to-day?"</p>
               <p>With the words, Dr. Vandyke clattered into the apartment, shook hands vigorously
                  with Lady Brand, and then went to Meta.</p>
               <p>"Oh, I am very glad to see you, doctor," said the child, with a bright smile. "Do
                  you know there is something about you—I don't know what, but I think it is
                  sunshine!"</p>
               <p>This seemed to highly please Dr. Vandyke.</p>
               <p>"Hear her!" he exclaimed. "And this is your boasted invalid—your pining sick
                  girl!"</p>
               <p>"I am not pining, doctor!"</p>
               <p>"I should think not! Pining? Ha, ha! You are radiant, inspiring, sunbeam
                  like—positively jolly!" exclaimed the doctor, in search of a word.</p>
               <p>"Then I am better?"</p>
               <p>"You are getting well so fast that it is a perfect farce for me to be coming all
                  the way from Williamsburg, through the snow, to look after you. But I knew 'twas
                  unnecessary. I came to the wedding."</p>
               <p>Meta looked a little sad at this, and sighed.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Cousin Honoria is to be married," she said, pensively; "and mamma tells me
                  everybody in the neighborhood is here."</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke's preternaturally acute ear caught the sigh, and his penetrating
                  intelligence comprehended it.</p>
               <p>"Edmund Innis is the only one absent," he said; "but that is easily accounted for:
                  he's left the country, for a time."</p>
               <p>"Left the country, doctor?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; some time since. You see, my dear, he had a sort of weakness for Mam'selle
                  Honoria, and was unwilling to be present on this joyous occasion. At first he was
                  unhappy about the affair, and would see nobody—not even his friend Phil Cary. When
                  he perceived the approach up the mountain-road of that young man, he shut up doors
                  and windows, retired to his inner den, and would not open. I went to see him,
                  however, and he did me the honor to receive me."</p>
               <p>"And—?" began Meta, eagerly.</p>
               <p>"We talked about the matter—discussed it in every form; and I found my young
                  friend quite resigned. The affair was unlucky, he said, but such things would
                  occasionally occur. He had loved Honoria—but that was over now. He could still
                  love her as her brother."</p>
               <p>Meta closed her eyes, murmuring to herself:</p>
               <p>"And I have changed too. I love <emph>him</emph> only as a sister might."</p>
               <p>"What did you say, my dear?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing, doctor. I am so glad that—Edmund—is resigned, and does not grieve."</p>
               <p>"Grieve? I think not! Why, my dear little one, only conceive that we spent a jolly
                  night together. I give you my word of honor, we made a bowl of punch, and, as well
                  as I remember—the punch was rather strong—we, or I, at least, chanted a
                  bacchanalian song—ha! ha!"</p>
               <p>What Dr. Vandyke stated "on his word of honor" was always the truth—omitting that
                  phrase, he considered himself, on certain occasions, and for certain purposes,
                  justifiable, we are sorry to say, in telling lies.</p>
               <p>"The song sung on this occasion was, I believe, 'The Jolly Miller,'" he continued.
                  "You have not heard it? It commences thus—"</p>
               <p>And, in a powerful voice, gesticulating as he sung, Dr. Vandyke chanted: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"'There was a jolly miller.</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">And a jolly wight was he'"—</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>At which point he suddenly stopped, exclaiming:</p>
               <p>"But the fine company will be startled by my mellifluous strains! Let us respect
                  the rules of good society, my friends."</p>
               <p>And, looking sidewise at Meta, Dr. Vandyke saw that she was ready to laugh.</p>
               <p>"Good!" he muttered; "who says there's no advantage in playing the buffoon?"</p>
               <p>And, in his careless, hearty voice, he said aloud:</p>
               <p>"In fact, my dear, we made a night of it, and I came near inducing our young
                  friend Innis to be present at the wedding, take things philosophically, and not go
                  on his travels. He determined, nevertheless, to adhere to his original intention
                  not to come, and to make a brief tour, at least, with a view of coming back home
                  when he had quieted down. So he went—won't be here—and now let us talk of other
                  things. You are fast recovering, my dear. I am going to feel your pulse, and put
                  my ear on your chest, just for the form of the thing."</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke then enclosed the thin wrist of Meta in his immense hand, the
                  index-finger touching the vein. At the same moment he bent down and placed his ear
                  upon the child's breast.</p>
               <p>"Pulse, excellent; breathing, all that could be wished," he said. "Only keep up
                  your spirits, my little snow-bird, and you'll soon be well."</p>
               <p>Meta smiled. The intelligence in reference to Innis had inexpressibly relieved
                  her, and now the good news of her condition further cheered her.</p>
               <p>"You are very changeable in your comparisons, doctor," she said; "you make me out
                  at one moment a snow-<emph>drop,</emph> and then a snow-<emph>bird.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"And are you not both? say, little Miss White-face, with your little chirping
                  voice."</p>
               <p>"You must be trying to make me laugh, doctor."</p>
               <p>"To make you laugh? Not a bit—I am telling you the truth. You are getting
                  well."</p>
               <p>Meta's face was lit up by a tender, happy light.</p>
               <p>"I am very, very glad, doctor," she said, gently. "I am not afraid to die, for God
                  is kind and good, and I do not fear Him—I love Him, and think. He would receive
                  me, a poor little child. But I would like to live—to be with mamma, and all I love
                  so—now."</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke's face slightly flushed.</p>
               <p>"Right," he said, no longer able to preserve his jocular air, and gazing, as he
                  spoke, at the child with great tenderness. He then looked at his watch, and turned
                  to Lady Brand, who had just risen.</p>
               <p>"I must retire and change my dress now, madam. Will you show me my chamber?"</p>
               <p>"At once, doctor."</p>
               <p>And, assuring Meta that she would send her her old nurse, who generally remained
                  in the chamber, Lady Brand went out with the doctor, closing the door. When they
                  were thus alone, the lady said:</p>
               <p>"You do not think as favorably of<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6141-00000063"/> the
                  poor child's condition as you seem to do, doctor?"</p>
               <p>"No," said Dr. Vandyke.</p>
               <p>"Why, then—"</p>
               <p>"Tell her lies? Because, if she lives, 'twill smooth the way; if she dies, 'twill
                  do no harm. I make it a point to tell lies in my profession, madam. There is no
                  change for the worse, that is all."</p>
               <p>Lady Brand sighed.</p>
               <p>"And what you said of Edmund?"</p>
               <p>"Was a lie also," returned Dr. Vandyke, with candor. "He is wretched enough. I
                  tried to cheer him and console him, but could do nothing; and can only say, I
                  think nothing unfortunate will happen, which I feared."</p>
               <p>"Heaven grant it! Whither did he go, doctor?"</p>
               <p>"I do not know."</p>
               <p>"This sad, sad business!"</p>
               <p>"Very sad, madam; but life is a sad affair, however you take it. Now, time is
                  passing, and I have an appointment with Lord Ruthven, who wishes to see me, he
                  says, for a few moments. Which is his chamber?"</p>
               <p>"The second door on the right after ascending the main staircase. You will
                  scarcely have time, doctor. Honoria's toilet is made, and the ceremony will soon
                  take place."</p>
               <p>"There will be time, doubtless."</p>
               <p>With which words Dr. Vandyke gained the hall, mounted the great staircase, which
                  wound up to the area above, and knocked at Lord Ruthven's door just at the moment
                  when Fergus had replaced the Highland dirk in the trunk, and asked his master if
                  any change was necessary in his dress.</p>

               <head>LI. THE INTERVIEW BETWEEN LORD RUTHVEN AND DR. VANDYKE.</head>
               <p>AT the words "Come in!" Dr. Vandyke turned the knob of the door and entered. In
                  the few moments which had elapsed since the end of the interview with Meta, the
                  eccentric physician's impression had undergone an entire change. In the child's
                  chamber he had laughed, jested, nearly played the clown—now he was cold, stern,
                  collected, with the air of a man who does not particularly relish the society of
                  the person with whom he is about to converse, and has made up his mind to be
                  surprised at nothing.</p>
               <p>As Dr. Vandyke advanced into the apartment, Lord Ruthven bowed with calm courtesy,
                  and said:</p>
               <p>"Welcome, doctor; I thank you for your punctuality."</p>
               <p>He then turned to Fergus.</p>
               <p>"Leave us to ourselves, Fergus, closing the door carefully. Remain there without,
                  and see that no one approaches the door. I wish to converse for a few moments with
                  Dr. Vandyke."</p>
               <p>Fergus silently left the apartment, closing the door after him. Lord Ruthven's
                  next proceeding was singular. He raised a window and looked out upon a species of
                  balcony, apparently to ascertain if any one were there; closed the window, went
                  and sounded the walls, carefully locked the door, and then returned to the
                  fireplace, near which Dr. Vandyke was standing.</p>
               <p>"We are entirely alone, doctor," he said, "and may converse upon matters the most
                  secret without danger of being overheard."</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke looked intently at Ruthven, but simply nodded.</p>
               <p>"This interview is, no doubt, a mystery to you—I mean its object?" continued Lord
                  Ruthven.</p>
               <p>"Humph!—perhaps—perhaps not."</p>
               <p>"We shall see—but you have visited Meta. She is better, I trust?"</p>
               <p>"No better."</p>
               <p>"Worse?"</p>
               <p>"No worse."</p>
               <p>"But not agitated—suffering?"</p>
               <p>"Not at all."</p>
               <p>"Will she live, or die?"</p>
               <p>Lord Ruthven seemed unable or unwilling to come to the real subject of the
                  interview.</p>
               <p>"Will she live, or die?" repeated Dr. Vandyke. "To answer that question I should
                  require to be a divinity—and I am a worm! What matters it? What is life or death?
                  This child will see the spring-flowers at Rivanna—or in heaven! 'Tis the
                  same."</p>
               <p>A dreamy glance of the eyes accompanied the words. The metallic voice was suddenly
                  modulated, and sounded like music.</p>
               <p>"You seem moved, doctor," said Lord Ruthven.</p>
               <p>"Moved?"</p>
               <p>"Your voice grows soft—I scarcely recognize it."</p>
               <p>"Well, that is the sequel of talking with a sick girl. I am nearly seventy,
                  without illusions—my heart is hard—well, the patience and sweetness of this child
                  have melted me. But, to business!"</p>
               <p>Lord Ruthven bowed.</p>
               <p>"True, doctor—and time presses. I have not requested you to inform me of Miss
                  Brand's condition; she fainted in consequence of a very disgusting scene at
                  dinner, but has, I am assured, recovered now, and is preparing for the approaching
                  ceremony."</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>Ruthven was silent for a moment; then he looked fixedly at the doctor, and
                  said:</p>
               <p>"'Tis of the ceremony—my marriage—that I desire to speak with you."</p>
               <p>"I know it."</p>
               <p>Ruthven was again silent. The glance fixed upon Dr. Vandyke grew more intense.</p>
               <p>"We are losing time, doctor," he said, with sudden gloom.</p>
               <p>"Well, come to the point!"</p>
               <p>"I will do so. You think me—insane!"</p>
               <p>"Is that a question?"</p>
               <p>"Reply to the words as though they were, doctor."</p>
               <p>"To be frank, then—I do."</p>
               <p>"And yet, you are absolutely mistaken."</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke smiled grimly, but said nothing. This silence and the expression of
                  the physician's countenance apparently irritated Lord Ruthven.</p>
               <p>"You would say—if you said any thing, sir," he exclaimed—"that madmen never
                  believe themselves mad, would you not? Well, that is perfectly just, and I do not
                  ask you to take my own denial. What I do ask of you is, an attentive perusal of
                  this paper."</p>
               <p>And, taking from his breast a folded document, Ruthven extended it toward Dr.
                  Vandyke.</p>
               <p>"'Tis a strange testimony, and on a strange subject," said Ruthven, relapsing into
                  gloom, "as you will perceive, sir. I, too, was disposed to entertain, at one time,
                  the same conviction you entertain—regarded myself as of unsound mind—and took
                  steps to determine the question. I visited Paris, Rome, Berlin, and the chief
                  cities of Europe, where, frankly, fully, without reservation, my case, to use the
                  medical term, was laid before the first physicians. These gentlemen subjected me
                  to the severest examination—prosecuted the investigation without ceremony—and
                  there is the result."</p>
               <p>Ruthven pointed, as he spoke, to the paper, upon which were a few lines of writing
                  in five different languages, signed by five of the first physicians of Europe. Of
                  these languages, Dr. Vandyke was familiar with four—French, German, Italian, and
                  Latin; and a perusal of the paper placed the fact beyond doubt that the man whom
                     <emph>he</emph> regarded as a madman was considered perfectly sane by five of
                  the most celebrated doctors of the Old World.</p>
               <p>The fact staggered him.</p>
               <p>"I see that you still doubt," said<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6141-00000064"/>
                  Ruthven; "and, after all, doctor, <emph>authority,</emph> however great it may be,
                  is still inconclusive, since the human mind is liable to error. Use, then, your
                  own judgment. Madmen have a strange glitter of the eye—<emph>my</emph> eyes, I
                  believe, are calm. Their expression is wild, roving—do you perceive aught of
                  wildness in mine? They talk incoherently—do I? I reason, remember, love, and hate
                     <emph>normally,</emph> and can be charged, I think, at worst, with being the
                  victim of an absurd superstition. Can you tell me what human being is
                     <emph>not</emph> irrational or superstitious upon <emph>some</emph> point?"</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke was more and more staggered. Lord Ruthven saw the advantage which be
                  had gained, and resumed with ardor the strange conversation.</p>
               <p>"I speak to one who will understand me, and weigh my words in the scales of
                  reason," he said. "You and I, doctor, are not children, or shallow gossips talking
                  neighborhood news. I would descend with you, if possible, into the depths of this
                  profound subject, and endeavor to reach some just and rational conclusion. Is that
                     <emph>rational?</emph>"</p>
               <p>And a sad smile came to the speaker's lips.</p>
               <p>"Yes; go on," said Dr. Vandyke.</p>
               <p>"Well, to sum up in a few words. You hold in your hand evidence of the fact that
                  the first <foreign xml:lang="FRA">savants</foreign> of Europe regard me as a
                  person of sound mind; neither in my eyes, my talk, nor my acts, do you perceive
                  traces of <emph>aberration</emph> of mind, which, I need not tell so distinguished
                  a physician as yourself, signifies divergence, either in diminution or excess,
                  from the normal condition. What remains is this simple superstition of—let us
                  speak plainly—second-sight; that is to say, the conviction that the future is
                  revealed to certain persons in dreams. That is all—is it not?"</p>
               <p>"All," said Dr. Vandyke.</p>
               <p>"Then I triumph! For, demand of your reading, your study, your observation,
                  whether the world is not full of 'vulgar errors'—if you choose to call this such.
                  Is the peasant <emph>insane</emph> who believes that the hare running across his
                  path brings bad fortune? Is the sailor <emph>insane</emph> who believes that
                  Friday is an ill day for the commencement of his voyage? Is the Irish squire
                     <emph>insane</emph> who believes that the <emph>banshee</emph> cries when Death
                  is about to visit his household? All <emph>believe</emph>—are they necessarily
                     <emph>insane</emph> therefore? Absurd, irrational, credulous, you may call
                  them; but are they really <emph>insane?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"That's good sense, I grant you," said Dr. Vandyke; "and <emph>your</emph>
                  superstition—"</p>
               <p>"Was, doubtless, instilled into me by some old Highland crone, who believed in
                  every thing and nothing. The child's mind is wax—doubtless, my own took the
                  imprint."</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke knit his brows.</p>
               <p>"And you yourself, then, consider all this second-sight business folly and
                  moonshine?" he said.</p>
               <p>Ruthven's brows were knit in turn; and, with a strange, gloomy look, he said:</p>
               <p>"I know not! How ask a human being, the victim of superstition, if he is
                  superstitions? I reason, simply—'tis for you to judge. And one of the elements of
                  your decision must be the rational or irrational character of my reasoning."</p>
               <p>"Judging thus, you are sane," said Dr. Vandyke. "No pride of opinion shall prevent
                  me from saying that. But—these stubborn <emph>buts!</emph>—tell me something more
                  important."</p>
               <p>"Speak, doctor."</p>
               <p>"This second-sight—what is it?"</p>
               <p>"The future seen in vision," replied Ruthven, in a low tone.</p>
               <p>"Seen clearly?"</p>
               <p>"Clearly!"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Recalled</emph> clearly when you awake?"</p>
               <p>"With absolute distinctness."</p>
               <p>"All—faces, places?"</p>
               <p>"All!" said Ruthven, in a still lower voice.</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke nodded.</p>
               <p>"Now, but one thing remains," he said—" to tell me what your vision, as you style
                  it, has been in connection with—"</p>
               <p>He paused, looking at Ruthven, who was as pale as death.</p>
               <p>"Speak out," the latter whispered.</p>
               <p>"In connection with Honoria Brand and Edmund Innis!" said Dr. Vandyke.</p>
               <p>Lord Ruthven breathed heavily, and made no reply. Fully five minutes elapsed
                  before he could speak. Then he said, in an almost inaudible tone:</p>
               <p>"'Twas to tell you that, or to let you read something I have written, that I asked
                  this interview."</p>
               <p>"To read something?"</p>
               <p>"This!"</p>
               <p>And Ruthven drew from his breast the paper which he had written on that night at
                  Williamsburg. Dr. Vandyke extended his hand to take it—his eyes blazing with
                  curiosity—but Ruthven drew back.</p>
               <p>"A moment!" he said. "Before proceeding further, or intrusting this paper to you,
                  I must exact a promise."</p>
               <p>"What promise?"</p>
               <p>"That you will take no steps to obstruct my marriage!"</p>
               <p>"To obstruct your marriage?"</p>
               <p>"You may otherwise fancy that 'tis—desirable—to do so."</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke looked gloomily at the speaker, whose cheeks had filled with
                  blood.</p>
               <p>"And if I refuse to give this promise?"</p>
               <p>"Your perusal of this paper will be impossible!"</p>
               <p>"I will give no promise!"</p>
               <p>"So be it."</p>
               <p>And Lord Ruthven restored the paper to his breast.</p>
               <p>"Stop!" said Dr. Vandyke, for his master-weakness, curiosity, overcame him. "What
                  is it that you exact as a condition precedent to my reading your statement?"</p>
               <p>"That you shall take no steps whatever, in consequence of having come into
                  possession of my secret."</p>
               <p>"What steps do you speak of?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Any</emph> steps!"</p>
               <p>"I am to remain silent, inactive—whatever I may read?"</p>
               <p>"Yes!"</p>
               <p>"Impossible!"</p>
               <p>Lord Ruthven inclined his head.</p>
               <p>"As you will, doctor. But, observe, that your ignorance is equally disadvantageous
                  with your obligation."</p>
               <p>"True," muttered Dr. Vandyke. With a hesitating movement, he extended his
                  hand.</p>
               <p>"Give it me!" he said.</p>
               <p>"You accept the condition?"</p>
               <p>"Yes!"</p>
               <p>"You swear upon your honor to remain silent, and to take no steps whatever to
                  place an obstacle in the way of my marriage with Miss Brand, whatever you may read
                  in this paper which I have written?"</p>
               <p>"I swear!"</p>
               <p>"Enough, sir. The word of a man like yourself is sufficient. Read!"</p>
               <p>And, unsealing the package, he extended it to Dr. Vandyke, who clutched it
                  eagerly, and began to read by the light of the wax-candles in the silver
                  candelabra on the tall mantel-piece. Lord Ruthven, meanwhile, remained erect near
                  the mantel-piece, upon one of whose caryed ledges he leaned his elbow. His face
                  had resumed its deep pallor, and his dark eyes were half closed, the long lashes
                  drooping toward the cheeks.</p>
               <p>As Dr. Vandyke proceeded with his perusal of the document, his countenance
                  gradually lost its color, and his lips were closely compressed, or, opening,
                  showed the large teeth set like iron beneath.<pb n="122-123"
                     xml:id="VAC6141-00000065"/> When approaching the middle of the paper, these
                  evidences of emotion became more marked and striking. Toward the end, every
                  particle of blood faded from his face, his bosom labored with long breaths, and,
                  suddenly finishing the paper, he whirled it from him, raised his head, and
                  exclaimed, in hoarse, imperious tones—his frame shaking, his eyes blazing:</p>
               <p>"You have laid a trap for me! You are—! Oh! to exact that oath! Monstrous! But I
                  will not be bound by it! Before I'll stand by, silent, and permit this marriage to
                  proceed, I will—"</p>
               <p>Ruthven stooped, and drew from the trunk, in which Fergus had hidden it, the
                  Highland dirk.</p>
               <p>"Here is the very weapon!" he said, in his deep voice. "Strike!"</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke drew a long breath, shuddering visibly.</p>
               <p>"You are mad, after all!" he muttered, hoarsely.</p>
               <p>"I am as same as yourself!"</p>
               <p>"I will reveal the contents of this accursed paper!"</p>
               <p>"You dare not! You are bound by your word of gentleman!"</p>
               <p>"And you would have me permit this murderous—"</p>
               <p>Lord Ruthven extended his hand, and placed it on the physician's lips.</p>
               <p>"Your promise!" he said.</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke fell heavily into a chair, uttering a groan. Lord Ruthven quietly
                  refolded the paper, sealed it again, placed it in a drawer of the table beside
                  him, and said, coldly:</p>
               <p>"<emph>If any thing should happen,</emph> remember that the paper is there. 'Tis
                  my vindication!"</p>
               <p>He shuddered as he uttered the words "if any thing should happen," and looked for
                  a moment at Dr. Vandyke in silence.</p>
               <p>"But, what <emph>can</emph> happen?" he continued, in a deep, firm, measured
                  voice. "Do you think, sir, that I would not plunge this dirk into my heart before
                  committing that crime? And ask yourself another question: <emph>What earthly
                     motive could I have for this deed without a name?</emph> Men act from rational
                  motives—except madmen; and you declare that I am not mad! What motive here? He has
                  left the country; and, as to the other, what earthly motive could impel me to a
                  deed at which my soul revolts? I love, adore, worship, this woman—I would lie down
                  and die to save her from a moment's suffering! And yet—you think—you dream that I
                  am capable—<emph>without motive,</emph> I say—<emph>without motive!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Woe to you!" cried Dr. Vandyke, suddenly bounding up and confronting the
                  speaker—"woe to you if you take one step toward the commission of this horror! I
                  am old, but not weak; I would slay you with my own hand!"</p>
               <p>"And you would do right! I will not resist! But listen."</p>
               <p>And he went close up to Dr. Vandyke.</p>
               <p>"I do not know," he said, in a low voice, "if there be truth or no in this
                  forewarning—if the devil will or will not tempt me to a crime without conceivable
                  reason! But I am a free agent to a certain point. This horror will take place, if
                  it takes place at all, at midnight. Well, neither at midnight, nor at any other
                  hour between the marriage ceremony and dawn, shall my foot be placed in that
                  chamber—do you hear, doctor?"</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke rose erect, and looked at the speaker with blazing eyes.</p>
               <p>"Swear it!" he said.</p>
               <p>Before Ruthven could reply, a knock was heard at the door, and Fergus entered.</p>
               <p>"They await you, my lord," he said; "the bride is ready."</p>

               <head>LII. UNDER THE OAK.</head>
               <p>DURING the progress of these scenes in private apartments of the large
                  establishment, numerous guests had continued to arrive, and the night was full of
                  noise.</p>
               <p>Chariot after chariot rolled up to the door, depositing portly old planters in
                  huge ruffles, smiling old dames in silk and diamonds, and beautiful damsels in
                  lace and satin, with pearls in their hair, and round arms sparkling with
                  bracelets; with them came young gallants on spirited horses. All hastened in out
                  of the cold; and the great mansion, blazing from garret to basement, was crowded
                  with a gay company, from which rose an incessant buzz and uproar.</p>
               <p>The disagreeable scene at dinner was not alluded to; jest and merriment and
                  laughter resounded; and the large assemblage, moving to and fro in the light of
                  the candelabra, was the picture of enjoyment.</p>
               <p>Such was the scene within. Without, the vast, wild landscape slept in its snowy
                  shroud, and the night wind swept along—a ghostly thing on invisible wings—across
                  the freezing expanse, to die away, with a low moan, in the dense evergreens.</p>
               <p>The moon had risen like a bloody shield, and, as it was rolled into the sky,
                  poured upon the dreary waste a mournful and mysterious light, which rendered the
                  snow more spectral, and the scene more forbidding. The lofty pines rose up like
                  phantoms; and, at certain moments, the night wind, in their tufted heads,
                  resembled the low cry of some creature perishing from cold, or calling for
                  assistance against danger.</p>
               <p>The contrast between this sombre scene and that within Rivanna was startling. The
                  company had all arrived; the drivers of the numerous vehicles were safely housed,
                  like their masters, from the cold; and silence had settled down on the wild waste
                  of snow, wrapping the whole earth as far as the eye could see.</p>
               <p>As the night advanced, there appeared on this chill expanse a single human
                  figure—that of a man who leaped the enclosure of the grounds below the hill,
                  crossed the expanse, with slow, measured steps, and reached the large oak-tree
                  beneath which Honoria and Innis had plighted their troth.</p>
               <p>Having reached this spot, the newcomer stopped, wrapped his cloak closely around
                  his shoulders, and leaned against the trunk—whose shadow concealed him—looking
                  intently, as he did so, toward the great mansion, blazing with lights.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>LIII. THE APPOINTMENT.</head>
               <p>HONORIA was standing before the mirror in her chamber, surrounded by the brilliant
                  little beauties, her bridesmaids, who, having assiduously aided the young lady in
                  making her toilet, now gazed at her with rapture. The sentiment seemed wholly
                  unaffected. Honoria's exquisite but girlish beauty had suddenly taken to itself
                  something cold and queenly, and it was only on a careful scrutiny that the rose in
                  the cheeks was seen to be a hectic flush, and the calmness of the eyes that of
                  utter despair.</p>
               <p>One person alone understood the young lady's feelings, and was not deceived by
                  this ominous calmness—her mother. Lady Brand had assisted her daughter in
                  dressing; had trembled at the thought of what she must pass through; and now gazed
                  at her with deep anxiety.</p>
               <p>"Be calm, dear—this is well," she said. "Come now, and sit down and rest before
                  the ceremony."</p>
               <p>"I am not tired, mother," was the young lady's reply, "and my strength will not
                  fail me."</p>
               <pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6141-00000066"/>
               <p>Lady Brand shook her head sadly.</p>
               <p>"My poor, poor child!" she murmured, "you appear calm, but you are really
                  feverish, agitated, laboring under nervous excitement."</p>
               <p>A strange smile came to the young lady's lips.</p>
               <p>"Excitement!—oh, no! mamma, I am perfectly calm."</p>
               <p>"At least come and sit down."</p>
               <p>"I would rather stand, mamma."</p>
               <p>Lady Brand sighed deeply.</p>
               <p>"But you must positively remain quiet: a few moments of privacy, to collect your
                  thoughts, my child—"</p>
               <p>And Lady Brand looked at the bridesmaids, who, taking the hint, quietly left the
                  apartment. As the last disappeared, mother and daughter exchanged a long look. But
                  no alteration took place in the young lady's demeanor. She was still perfectly
                  calm, but this, it was obvious, arose from a morbid state of mind.</p>
               <p>"My child," exclaimed Lady Brand, "you are very, very unwell! Come, lean your head
                  upon my bosom; it will rest and soothe you! You will remember, perhaps, the time
                  when you were a little child, and dropped to sleep there."</p>
               <p>The fond mother's arms were extended, but Honoria did not move.</p>
               <p>"O me!" she murmured. "I am not a child!—if I only were a little child
                  again—!"</p>
               <p>"You are my child still, my own dear little one!"</p>
               <p>The words came with a burst of grief from the trembling lips.</p>
               <p>"Come—lean your head here!—it will rest you, my own Honoria!"</p>
               <p>But the young lady drew back, and the same strange smile again came to her
                  lips.</p>
               <p>"Lean my head upon your breast, mamma!" she said, in a singular voice.</p>
               <p>"How can you propose such a thing? 'Twould spoil my bonny bridal curls and
                  flowers."</p>
               <p>As she spoke, she pointed to the snowy wreath above her long bridal veil, and
                  began to sing in a low voice: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"'Oh! the bonny, bonny bride,</l>
                        <l>And the bonny, bonny flowers</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">In her hair!'"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The strange intonation of the girl's voice made her mother tremble.</p>
               <p>"Come, come, Honoria!" she exclaimed, in accents of displeasure, "this is out of
                  place!"</p>
               <p>"What is out of place, mamma!"</p>
               <p>"This levity—this unnatural gayety. It belies your feelings."</p>
               <p>"Belies my feelings, mamma?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes! Honoria—you never were so miserable!"</p>
               <p>"Miserable?" repeated the young lady, with the same strange smile on her lips,
                  "why, what an idea! Am I not about to become the 'happy bride' of a very great
                  nobleman—to make a brilliant match, as every one says? I shall soon become my Lady
                  Ruthven!—and what more silly than to feel miserable at being made a countess?"</p>
               <p>"My child—my child! Your voice is strange! You are not in your right senses!"</p>
               <p>"Why not, mamma—?"</p>
               <p>"Because I know your secret!—that you look with horror upon this marriage!"</p>
               <p>Honoria slowly and coldly shook her head.</p>
               <p>"With horror?" she said; "I <emph>look with horror</emph> upon my approaching
                  marriage? Is such a thing conceivable, mamma? Would my father, who says that he
                  loves me dearly, compel me to marry thus against my will? Could he possibly make
                  his poor child so wretched? Could <emph>you</emph>—my own mother—!"</p>
               <p>Honoria suddenly stopped. Lady Brand had covered her face with both hands, and
                  burst into tears. For a moment the girl looked at her in silence, and without
                  moving. Then suddenly she ran to her, broke into a wild flood of weeping, and,
                  throwing her arms around her mother's neck, cried:</p>
               <p>"O mamma! mamma! do not sob so! 'Twill break my poor heart! I was undutiful,
                  unfeeling, to taunt you when 'tis not your fault! Forgive me, mamma!—no, I am not
                  in my right senses—I am wretched—out of my head almost. This marriage is killing
                  me, for I am going to perjure myself before God and man; but I will strive to bear
                  all, and not make you more unhappy, mamma! Forgive me! forget my wicked words—I
                  love you so dearly!"</p>
               <p>Clinging to Lady Brand, she buried her face in her mother's bosom, and sobbed
                  until her agitated heart grew calmer. Tears had come to her at last, as a blessed
                  relief—the burst of the tempest relieved her overcharged brain—and her mother saw,
                  with delight, that the dull and apathetic look had disappeared from her eyes.
                  Honoria was quite hopeless, but calm and resigned.</p>
               <p>"There, there, mamma," she said, pressing her lips to her mother's cheek, "do not
                  remember my wild, sinful words, and forget that I rebelled against God, and
                  taunted you, when I ought to love and obey you, and treat you with respect. I am
                  very unhappy, mamma, but—I will try not to wound you again. You see I am quite
                  calm now, and—kiss me, mamma—I love you very, very dearly, and soon—shall—see you
                  no more."</p>
               <p>The head sank, and Honoria uttered a single sob. It was the last cry of her
                  despair. Her mother could only whisper as she held her close:</p>
               <p>"God bless and keep my child, and give us both strength to bear this woe! for I
                  know all, my daughter—I know, and am powerless as yourself. Come, now—dry your
                  eyes, and summon all your courage, for the hour is near. Let me arrange your
                  disordered hair; the idle crowd must not make their comments."</p>
               <p>"Do not fear me," said the young girl with sudden calmness and stateliness. "I
                  know what my blood requires of me, and will not fail. And now will you do me a
                  last favor, mamma? Leave me to myself for a few moments. I would be alone—have no
                  fear, mamma; and do not ask me why."</p>
               <p>Lady Brand looked intently at her daughter, and said:</p>
               <p>"Leave you alone?"</p>
               <p>The girl smiled sadly.</p>
               <p>"You fear I'll do myself some mischief, perchance! No, indeed! There need be no
                  fear of that, mamma. I shall die of this marriage; but not now! Pray grant my
                  request."</p>
               <p>Lady Brand rose.</p>
               <p>"I will go, then, my child; but remember that your presence will soon be
                  required."</p>
               <p>With which words, she left the apartment.</p>
               <p>Honoria listened to the light, retreating steps; went quickly to the door; turned
                  the key without noise in the ponderous old-fashioned lock; and then, hastening to
                  a casket, unlocked it, took out a paper, and read it hurriedly by the lights on
                  her toilet-table.</p>
               <p>The paper was a note, which a servant had brought on the day before, and ran as
                  follows:</p>

                              the wedding-guests, and witness your marriage. That would kill me, or

               <p>Why had she written that note, forgetting the cold, the snow, the almost utter
                  impossibility of keeping the appointment? She knew not; she only felt that she
                  must see him once more, or die. She now hastily read the note of Innis again, and
                  thrust it into her bosom. Then she sat down, clinched her hands together, and
                  gazed into the fire.</p>
               <p>"I will go!—nothing shall fright me!—Edmund, Edmund!"</p>
               <p>Suddenly steps were heard in the passage, and a hand was laid upon the knob.

               <head>LIV. THE MARRIAGE.</head>
               <p>THE moment had come for the performance of the marriage-ceremony. The crowd,
                  filling the drawing-rooms, the hall, every foot of space, all at once ceased their
                  uproar. A deep silence followed; and, in the midst of this silence, the rustle of
                  satin trains was heard at the head of the staircase, like a breeze of summer
                  rustling the long blades of corn. An instant afterward the imposing bridal party
                  descended slowly, the bridesmaids leaning upon the arms of their groomsmen, the
                  ample trains sweeping the polished oak of the staircase.</p>
               <p>The bride and groom came last.</p>
               <p>Honoria was very pale, but quite calm, and did not seem to require the arm of Lord
                  Ruthven to support her, as she scarcely touched it with one of her little, white,
                  gloved hands. She was superbly dressed, and wore a profusion of lace, hereditary
                  in the family, with not a few jewels of great value. Her air was collected, and
                  exhibited no emotion whatever. Lord Ruthven, on the contrary, evidently labored
                  under very considerable agitation. He was paler even than the bride, and the smile
                  which he endeavored to assume was so plainly forced that it was painful. Once,
                  while descending the staircase, he turned his head quickly, and glanced with a
                  singular expression over his right shoulder—a circumstance which was afterward
                  spoken of, and commented upon in various ways.</p>
               <p>The bridal train entered the large drawing-room, where the reverend parson of the
                  parish was standing in his black gown; and the bridesmaids and groomsmen,
                  separating, and ranging themselves in two opposing lines, left an avenue open for
                  the bride and groom, who slowly advanced and stood before the clergyman.</p>
               <p>Honoria retained her surprising calmness—a calmness far exceeding that of her
                  companion—and the ceremony proceeded, Colonel Brand giving away the bride.</p>
               <p>At the injunction of the clergyman, that, if any one knew just cause why the
                  ceremony should not take place, they should speak then, or forever after hold
                  their peace, it was observed that Honoria half turned her head with a sudden look
                  of fright, apparently dreading or expecting some interruption. None, however, took
                  place; Honoria duly bowed her head, murmuring inaudibly the responses, and a
                  prayer ended the ceremony.</p>
               <p>Honoria Brand had become the Countess of Ruthven.</p>
               <p>Then commenced the joyous uproar customary in Virginia upon wedding occasions. The
                  young lady found her cold, pale lips saluted by her friends, and this evidence of
                  regard was bestowed, even upon the bridesmaids, by all with the slightest claim,
                  from consanguinity, to that privilege. Lord Ruthven received his share of the
                  congratulations of the company—the low bows and impressive hand-shakings of the
                  portly old nabobs, and the good wishes of the dames their partners—with profound
                  courtesy and elaborate smiles. But it was plain that these smiles were forced.
                  When left for a moment to himself, his countenance assumed a singular expression
                  of haunting gloom; and twice he was observed to cast the strange, furtive glance
                  over his right shoulder which had already attracted the attention of the
                  guests.</p>
               <p>As the night drew on, and the hour of supper approached, Honoria was seen to look
                  more than once toward the tall clock in the hall, and to glance sidewise through
                  one of the great windows toward the lawn without. Her pale cheek was slightly
                  tinged with blood, and the eyes, so apathetic throughout the ceremony, betrayed
                  concealed agitation. At last her lips were compressed in a manner which seemed to
                  indicate that she had formed some resolution; and, turning to her mother, who was
                  standing near, she said:</p>
               <p>"Mamma, I am somewhat tired from standing too long. Make my excuses to any one who
                  inquires for me; I will retire for a little while, but return soon."</p>
               <p>"Very well, my dear," said Lady Brand, who was not unwilling that the young lady
                  should rest for a short time from her fatigue; "but do not stay long. Supper will
                  be ready in half an hour."</p>
               <p>"Yes, mamma, I will be ready."</p>
               <p>And smiling upon the company, who made way for her, admiring as they did so her
                  now rosy cheeks, Honoria went up the broad staircase to her chamber, in which she
                  disappeared.</p>
               <p>The uproar in the great drawing-room had now become deafening; and perhaps this
                  circumstance was, in no slight degree, to be attributed to the frequent visits of
                  a large number of the guests to a small room in rear of the large hall, where
                  stood, on a centre-table, an enormous punch-bowl, filled with arrack-punch,
                  flanked by a mighty array of bottles containing mellow old Jamaica rum, brandies,
                  and the richest vintages of sherry and canary. A huge silver ladle reposed in the
                  punch-bowl, or, rather, was not permitted to do so for a moment by the festive
                  visitors, holding out impatient tumblers; and two attentive servants, silent,
                  rapid in their movements, and profoundly deferential, opened incessantly the wine
                  bottles, and handed glasses to the old planters, who sipped in a stately way, and
                  loomed above the more youthful company, the red and important old faces rising
                  over masses of white neck-cloth and ruffles. In this room the crowd was
                  continuous, the noise great; when the visitors returned to the drawing-room they
                  smiled elaborately, and were communicative in the highest degree upon any and
                  every subject.</p>
               <p>At last the old major-domo opened the door of the dining-room a few inches, and
                  respectfully looked at Lady Brand, to signify that supper was ready. Lady Brand
                  looked around for Honoria, but did not see her; and, saying to Lord Ruthven, as
                  she passed him, "Supper is about to be announced, my lord," she went into the
                  dining-room, closing the door.</p>
               <p>Ruthven seemed to greet the announcement that supper was near—that is to say, that
                  the trying evening was coming to an end—with deep satisfaction; and looked around
                  for Honoria, to whom etiquette required that he should give his arm. She was
                  nowhere to be seen; and, thinking that she might have gone out into the hall, from
                  the great<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6141-00000068"/> heat of the immense fire in
                  the drawing-room, went thither to find her. But Honoria was not in the hall.</p>
               <p>A maid was passing at the moment, and, supposing that Honoria was in her chamber,
                  Lord Ruthven directed the maid to go thither, and inform her mistress that the
                  company was about to go in to supper.</p>
               <p>The maid hastened to obey, Lord Ruthven waiting her in the hall; but in a few
                  minutes she returned with the in formation that the young lady was not in her
                  chamber.</p>
               <p>"Not in her chamber?" exclaimed Lord Ruthven; "where, then, can she be?"</p>
               <p>The great front-door suddenly opened behind him as he spoke, and a person, who
                  came in, heard the words. Lord Ruthven felt a hand laid upon his arm, and a low
                  voice whispered in his ear:</p>
               <p>"Hush, my lord!—and come with me!"</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>LV. THE STEPS IN THE SNOW.</head>
               <p>THE voice was that of Fergus. Ruthven turned suddenly, and gazed at the old
                  Highlander with undisguised astonishment and vague disquiet; and the expression of
                  the ancient servitor's countenance was not calculated to dispel his emotion. The
                  weather-beaten face was flushed, and the eyes of Fergus sparkled with wrath. His
                  lips were compressed like iron, and the hand which he had laid upon his master's
                  arm was so heavy and unceremonious—so indicative of forgetfulness of every form of
                  respect—that Lord Ruthven felt his heart throb, his pulse give a great leap.</p>
               <p>"What is it?" he said, grasping the Highlander suddenly by the arm.</p>
               <p>"Hist! my lord—make no noise!"</p>
               <p>"Your meaning? You are no child!" exclaimed Ruthven; "you must have good reason
                  for this abrupt address!"</p>
               <p>"I have; of that you shall judge! Follow me, my Lord."</p>
               <p>"Go on!" said Lord Ruthven.</p>
               <p>Fergus glided through the door; Ruthven followed, and it closed behind them. They
                  had passed, in three steps, into another world, as it were. The sepulchral glare
                  of the snow, bathed in icy moonlight, and the freezing wind, which cut like a
                  sharp steel blade through the nobleman's thin silk coat, made the contrast between
                  the warm apartments within and the frozen expanse without as striking as it was
                  abrupt.</p>
               <p>But Ruthven did not heed it for an instant. A vague suspicion fired his frame, and
                  sent the blood boiling to his cheeks.</p>
               <p>"Well!" he said to Fergus.</p>
               <p>"Follow me, my lord!"</p>
               <p>"Your object?"</p>
               <p>"To show you something—come?"</p>
               <p>Fergus wont rapidly, as he spoke, down the broad steps; turned and followed the
                  facade of the mansion; came in sight of a side-door, opening on the lawn, and,
                  looking round, exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Your lordship's married a bonny bride!"</p>
               <p>"What do you mean, I say! Speak!" cried Lord Ruthven, imperiously.</p>
               <p>"That will I, speedily, my lord. Where is the countess?"</p>
               <p>"I know not!"</p>
               <p>"I know."</p>
               <p>"Where? Your meaning, Fergus?—Something in your words—your voice—!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes—your lordship is right. I have lost my coolness, even my respect; and
                  yet, I must go further—I must exact a promise from your lordship!"</p>
               <p>"A promise! The meaning of all this? Speak if you would have me retain my
                  senses!"</p>
               <p>"Promise that—you will not slay my lady."</p>
               <p>"Slay!—you are mad!"</p>
               <p>"I am in my senses—promise, my lord!"</p>
               <p>"I promise nothing, and I command you to explain your words! Speak! or, by Heaven,
                  I'll tear your meaning out of your very heart!"</p>
               <p>And Ruthven seized the old servant by the throat, shaking him with such violence
                  that he seemed about to strangle him.</p>
               <p>Fergus made no remonstrance whatever. He simply gasped for breath, and Ruthven
                  released his grasp.</p>
               <p>"I obey your lordship, then," said Fergus. "I've done my duty at least."</p>
               <p>"Where is Lady Ruthven?"</p>
               <p>Fergus started down, and pointed to the snow.</p>
               <p>"Look, my lord!" he said.</p>
               <p>Ruthven looked, and saw the imprint of a small delicate slipper in the snow.</p>
               <p>"There is another!" said Fergus, in a low tone, "and another still. The person
                  came out of that side-door; it has not been long since, you see, my lord, as the
                  wind has not filled the tracks; and you can tell in which direction the person
                  went. There are the steps!"</p>
               <p>His master no longer listened. With a burning cheek, and a heart which throbbed
                  almost to bursting, Ruthven followed the delicate footsteps down the hill, the
                  moonlight enabling him to do so without difficulty. Stooping and hastening onward,
                  he resembled some wild animal crouching, and ready to spring upon his prey.
                  Suddenly a cloud passed over the moon, and the dull glare of the snow barely
                  afforded him the means of tracing the steps. It was sufficient, however, and
                  Ruthven rapidly descended the slope, leaving the great gate far on his left. All
                  at once a deep shadow fell upon the marks in the snow. He looked up and saw a
                  great oak, distant twenty or thirty paces.</p>
               <p>At the same moment, the sound of voices was heard; and a voice which he recognized
                  as that of Honoria murmured:</p>
               <p>"I will love you in life and death!"</p>
               <p>Ruthven's burning glance followed the direction of the sound, penetrated the
                  shadow, and saw Honoria clasped in the arms of Edmund Innis.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>LVI. THE LAST MEETING.</head>
               <p>HONORIA had kept her appointment.</p>
               <p>Ascending the staircase rapidly, after speaking to Lady Brand, she had reached her
                  chamber, wrapped a cloak around her, and descending by a flight of stairs in the
                  rear of the hall—that which she had used on the night of the dumb-cake
                  ceremony—had opened the side-door, gone forth into the freezing night, and
                  hastened down the hill toward the great oak under which Innis awaited her.</p>
               <p>Flying, affrighted and trembling, over the snow which, at any other time, would
                  have made her feet in thin satin slippers ache with cold, she had reached the
                  tree, had seen the figure of Innis hasten toward her; and had fallen, weak,
                  overwhelmed, and powerless to bear up under her emotion, into the outstretched
                  arms of her lover.</p>
               <p>Then followed one of those scenes which the pen cannot describe, and the
                  imagination only can form any conception of. Forgetting all the world besides—her
                  past, her present, and her future—remembering only that the human being whom she
                  loved with such unspeakable tenderness was before her; and obeying the resistless
                  impulse driving her, like a weary, storm-lost dove, into his sheltering arms, she
                  clung closely to him, clasped him wildly to her bosom, and exhausted on him every
                  term of endearment, in one passionate outburst, which she made no effort to
                  control.</p>
               <p>And Innis, broken-hearted and despairing, could only reply in broken<pb
                     n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6141-00000069"/> words. His great woe came upon him at
                  this last conclusive moment, with an intenser bitterness than ever before. The
                  sense of what he had lost sent a chill to his very heart, and a cruel, mad despair
                  was mingled with the delicious happiness of the girl's caresses.</p>
               <p>For many moments they thus remained, locked in each other's arms, murmuring words
                  of endearment, and striving to control their passionate agitation. Innis was the
                  first to succeed in this, and, choking down violently a groan which had risen to
                  his pale lips, he said in a trembling voice:</p>
               <p>"I thank you for this last meeting, my own darling. I may call you so now—'tis the
                  last time; and now you must go back; you must not stay here longer in this bitter
                  cold! I felt as though I should have died without these few last words with
                  you—these kisses you have given me—and now I can say farewell!"</p>
               <p>He tried to unclasp the arms of the girl, but she resisted.</p>
               <p>"Oh, no! no!" she exclaimed, in a voice interrupted by sobs, "we need not part so
                  soon! Why must we part?"</p>
               <p>"They will miss you, and wonder at your absence; and this bitter night! Your poor,
                  dear little feet in their thin slippers!—they will freeze! Yes, you must go, my
                  darling; we must part now. I am calmer than I was; almost happy, dear. My heart
                  was black with evil thoughts, with hatred, and all bitterness. I doubted God, and
                  man, and woman. I was desperate, and meditated desperate things; but I have seen
                  your dear, good face, my own Honoria; I have heard your voice, and I think I can
                  bear my misery. Farewell, now—you must go; but tell me once more that you will not
                  forget your poor cousin, however far away from you I may be; that you will pray
                  for me, and try not to grieve over what might have been! Promise this, Honoria—my
                  love—my lost love—and I shall be almost happy!"</p>
               <p>It was in reply to these words that Honoria, raising her head from his bosom, and
                  letting it fall back upon his shoulder, had uttered in a murmur the words—</p>
               <p>"I will love you in life and death!"</p>
               <p>As the words escaped from her lips, the moon emerged from the black cloud which
                  had concealed it, and Innis heard the sound of footsteps. He raised his head
                  quickly, looked in the direction of the sound, and Honoria's eyes turned toward
                  the same quarter.</p>
               <p>Lord Ruthven and Fergus were within a few paces of her, easily recognized by the
                  moonlight; and with a low cry she fell back in the arms of Innis, and fainted upon
                  his breast.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>LVII. THE ADVERSARIES.</head>
               <p>RUTHVEN did not rush upon Innis, or, indeed, betray any evidence whatever of
                  violent emotion. A sudden and strange calmness seemed to have succeeded his wild
                  rage. He had apparently reached that stage when men grow pale instead of red, cold
                  instead of violent; and when the mind, discarding all mere flurry and passion,
                  decides coolly and in silence upon the course to be pursued.</p>
               <p>The deadly glance of the young nobleman's dark eyes, and the ashy pallor of his
                  lips, alone indicated the depth of his wrath; his voice, when he spoke, was firm
                  and measured.</p>
               <p>"It is quite unnecessary to hold me back," he said to Fergus, who, knowing the
                  terrible strength of his master's passions when they were once aroused, had seized
                  his arm to restrain him from advancing farther. "I do not purpose doing any thing
                  rash. Remove your hand from my arm, and remain where you now are, until you
                  receive further orders from me."</p>
               <p>Fergus released the grasp on his master's ter's arm, and Ruthven advanced slowly
                  and deliberately until he closely confronted Honoria and Innis. The latter had
                  quickly regained his coolness, and returned Ruthven's fixed and icy glance with a
                  look of the same description.</p>
               <p>"I will relieve you of Lady Ruthven, sir," said the young nobleman; "as the night
                  is unpleasantly cold, and in so thin a dress, she might suffer inconvenience from
                  further exposure. I shall escort her ladyship to the house, and, as it will be
                  necessary to have a brief discussion with you afterward, sir, shall beg you to
                  await my return without moving from this place. May I count upon you, sir?"</p>
               <p>"You may, my lord!" returned Innis, in an ardent tone. There was no doubt of the
                  intention of Ruthven. His eye said all; and Innis greeted the thought of mortal
                  combat with his successful rival with a thrill of fierce satisfaction.</p>
               <p>As he spoke, Honoria opened her eyes, and returned to consciousness. Her glance
                  met the cold eyes of Ruthven fixed upon her; she understood all; and suddenly
                  exclaimed, in a tone of agony:</p>
               <p>"Oh, I am innocent of intended wrong!—It was but for a moment—one last meeting—I
                     <emph>had</emph> to bid him good-by!—Edmund!—my lord—!"</p>
               <p>"Enough, madam!" said Ruthven, abruptly, a species of contortion passing over his
                  dark face. "With your permission we will not discuss this subject further at
                  present!"</p>
               <p>He advanced, as he spoke, took the young lady's hand, placed it upon his arm, and,
                  exchanging with Innis a meaning glance, reconducted Honoria toward the house,
                  followed by Fergus. No words were exchanged between the bridegroom and bride upon
                  the way. Honoria was sobbing—from Ruthven's lips no sound issued.</p>
               <p>Following the steps in the snow, they reached the side-door, through which Honoria
                  had gained the lawn. Here Ruthven stopped, and said:</p>
               <p>"As you doubtless desire to observe the proprieties, and avoid all scandal, madam,
                  it will be best to enter by this door and gain your chamber. Supper is ready to be
                  announced; and I will attend you at the foot of the great staircase."</p>
               <p>Honoria bowed her head, and, replying only with a low sob, entered the side-door,
                  and closed it behind her. Ruthven then went around to the front of the house,
                  ascended the broad steps, carefully removed from his boots all traces of snow,
                  and, opening the great door, entered. His entrance did not attract attention, and
                  he had reached the thresh-hold of the drawing-room, when he encountered Colonel
                  Brand.</p>
               <p>"We were looking for you, my lord, as supper is ready; and, strangely enough, Lady
                  Ruthven also is not to be found."</p>
               <p>"She has retired to her chamber, in all probability, sir."</p>
               <p>"I think not."</p>
               <p>And Colonel Brand turned to look for Lady Brand to ask. Time was thus afforded the
                  young lady to reach her chamber, divest herself of her cloak, suppress her
                  agitation, and descend. Lord Ruthven met her at the foot of the staircase, as he
                  had promised, offered his arm, with a profound inclination; and, supper being
                  announced at the same moment, the bridal party, followed by the guests, entered
                  the great dining-room. The apartment was one blaze of lights, and this brilliant
                  flood fell upon a table extending nearly the whole length of the room, and
                  groaning with its burden of substantials and delicacies of every imaginable
                  description. Meats, game, confections—each in a dozen varieties, and a dozen
                  methods of serving—pyramids of cake, and exotic fruits, ices, jellies, and, on a
                  side-table, coffee, tea, "strong-waters," the richest wines—<pb
                     n="132 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC6141-00000070"/> such formed a portion, and
                  only a portion, of the entertainment offered by Colonel and Lady Brand to their
                  guests.</p>
               <p>The crowd flocked in, noisy, joyous, full of laughter; and few paid any attention
                  to the bride and groom. Those who did so, however, afterward spoke of Lord
                  Ruthven's courtly attention to his bride. He waited upon her most assiduously;
                  and, but for a strange glitter of the eyes, was the model of an overjoyed
                  bridegroom. That metallic glitter was not inviting, it is true, and was afterward
                  remembered; but, for the moment, all was joy and uproar.</p>
               <p>One person only was not so easily deceived. With eyes sharpened by tenderness for
                  her daughter, Lady Brand saw the evidences of deep, suppressed emotion; and,
                  knowing that Honoria had not been in her chamber ten minutes before her
                  reappearance, sought an opportunity now to question her, and hear a solution of
                  the mystery. This design of Lady Brand seemed, however, to be penetrated by Lord
                  Ruthven, who persistently remained by Honoria, or returned instantly if forced to
                  leave her; and when the fond mother, weary of this struggle of wits, addressed a
                  plain question to the young lady, Ruthven replied, quickly, with a singular
                  smile:</p>
               <p>"No, madam! I beg you will not insist upon your question. Your daughter is Lady
                  Ruthven now, and is entitled to have her own secrets!"</p>
               <p>Lady Brand looked earnestly at the speaker, but his face was impenetrable.</p>
               <p>"Well, my lord," she said, gloomily, "tis for you to decide; but you will let me
                  say that the augury is not happy when the bride begins by having secrets from her
                  own mother."</p>
               <p>Ruthven did not reply, and soon afterward the company began to move back toward
                  the drawing-room, whither the bride and bridegroom led the way—Honoria pale and
                  faint—Ruthven cold, firm, and impassive.</p>
               <p>Lord Ruthven led his bride to a seat near the fire, and then made her a low bow.
                  With her permission, he said he would return to the supper-room; and, passing
                  through the crowd, with a formal smile on his lips, he reached the hall. He did
                  not go thence, however, to the supper-room, but to his chamber, where Fergus was
                  seated, his elbows on his knees, his face sunk in his hands.</p>
               <p>"Come, quick!—the swords!" said Ruthven. "I have worn none to-night; but there are
                  two of the same length!"</p>
               <p>Fergus faltered out:</p>
               <p>"Your lordship will not—! Think! after all, 'twas but—!"</p>
               <p>"Silence!—obey the order I give you! The dress-swords, and my cloak!"</p>
               <p>Dominated by the imperious voice and flaming eyes, Fergus drew from one of the
                  trunks, with a trembling hand, two dress-swords, which Ruthven seized. The latter
                  then threw a cloak around his shoulders, concealed the swords beneath it, and,
                  saying imperiously to Fergus—"Remain here; I command you!" went hastily out of the
                  room. He had taken notice of the position of the side-door, through which Honoria
                  had reentered. This he now gained by the back staircase, for the moment quite
                  deserted, opened the door, passed through, closed it behind him, and went rapidly
                  down the hill toward the oak.</p>

               <head>LVIII. THE COMBAT.</head>
               <p>INNIS had not stirred from the spot.</p>
               <p>What thoughts had passed through the mind of the despairing young man, as he
                  waited in the freezing cold, with Honoria's innocent kisses yet warm upon his
                  lips, and a bloody combat with her husband imminent? Despair is a strange
                  stimulant, and Innis had little hope left him in the world. Burnt up by harsh and
                  gloomy emotion—seeing nothing in<figure>
                     <head>The Combat.</head>
                  </figure>
                  <pb n="133" xml:id="VAC6141-00000071"/> the future for him but hopeless misery—he
                  greeted almost with joy the coming struggle, which would probably end his life and
                  his woes together. That such a struggle was near he had no doubt whatever—a single
                  combat with swords, doubtless; and as, like all young gentlemen at that time, he
                  had been taught the use of the rapier, there would be no obstacle.</p>
               <p>Suddenly Ruthven's figure appeared in the moonlight. He almost rushed toward
                  Innis, reached him, and exclaimed, in a hollow tone:</p>
               <p>"It is well sir! You keep your word at least! You will not add cowardice to
                  treachery!"</p>
               <p>"Treachery, sir!" cried Innis—"cowardice! Beware, sir! By Heavon, if you insult me
                  thus, I'll throw myself, weaponless as I am, upon you, and tear you to
                  pieces!"</p>
               <p>Ruthven threw back his cloak.</p>
               <p>"Here are two swords!" he said, "of equal length and good temper. You are not
                  weaponless, sir, since one is for you!"</p>
               <p>And he hurled it at Innis's feet in the snow, his eyes burning with lurid
                  fire.</p>
               <p>The young man stooped quickly, and caught it by the hilt.</p>
               <p>"Thanks!" he said; "this combat need not be delayed, then."</p>
               <p>"No! here and now! Here, where—"</p>
               <p>And, with an expression of deadly menace, Lord Ruthven took a step, sword in hand,
                  toward his enemy.</p>
               <p>"A moment, my lord!—there is time enough!" said Innis, in a cold and gloomy tone.
                  "As one or both of us will probably be dead in an hour from this time, a few words
                  are necessary."</p>
               <p>"I want none! Defend yourself!"</p>
               <p>The sharp point glittered in front of the young man's breast; but he remained
                  perfectly motionless.</p>
               <p>"I say that these words are necessary," he replied, in the same gloomy tone. "What
                  you mean by <emph>treachery</emph> I am unable to understand, sir! We were mere
                  acquaintances—I never professed to be your bosom friend; and if there be wrong
                  done, who is guilty of that wrong?"</p>
               <p>"Enough—!"</p>
               <p>"You shall hear me! and, as I may be driven to rage, I'll speak first of what is
                  most important," said Innis. "You are so ignorant of the person who is now Lady
                  Ruthven, that you madly dream that she <emph>could</emph> be guilty of an impure
                  action! That is the madness of jealousy, and suspicion, sir—naught else! Honoria
                  is as pure as that snow; as the moon above you! Her sole fault, if it be a fault,
                  has been her imprudence in granting me, to-night, at my urgent request, a few
                  moments to say farewell, before we parted forever. I am about to leave Virginia—I
                  loved her—you know that—I besought her to see me for an instant before I went; she
                  was here for a little space, thus, at my own solicitation; and had you not come,
                  the young lady and myself would have parted—"</p>
               <p>"With a last embrace! with kisses!—with caresses!—with 'love in life and death!'
                  Your sword, sir! This shall end!"</p>
               <p>"A single moment more, sir," Innis replied, with the same immovable coldness, but
                  a bitterness in his tone. "Your lordship is the lucky one, and can afford to
                  listen an instant, if only to prevent misunderstanding when our ghosts meet in
                  another world! Well, before she met <emph>you,</emph> Lady Ruthven was engaged to
                  be married to <emph>me.</emph> You did not know that? 'Tis true, sir; and the
                  circumstance was not so astonishing. We were cousins, had been playmates all our
                  lives here at Rivanna; and before she went to Williamsburg, where she first saw
                  you, plighted her faith to me here under this very oak-tree, where she came to bid
                  me farewell to-night. That is a bitter memory to the poor, unhappy man who speaks
                     to<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6141-00000072"/> you—must it not be, sir? Well, I
                  soon saw that Honoria was not to choose her mate. You paid your addresses, and I
                  asked for her hand. Her father refused <emph>me</emph>—I was very poor; and
                  accepted <emph>you.</emph> Did the young lady? And, in spite of all, I was going
                  away, now—after these few words of farewell.</p>
               <p>"That is the history of three persons, sir—one happy, the other two miserable. As
                  to this meeting, I repeat, sir, that it was my fault, and meant nothing. You speak
                  of <emph>kisses</emph>—in Virginia, young ladies kiss kinsmen. I was this
                  one's—she was innocent as an angel—do not give the devil that triumph of believing
                     <emph>Honoria Brand</emph> other than purity itself! And now I've done, my
                  lord. If there be fault in any one, the fault is mine. Spend your wrath on me; for
                  that wrath I care nothing, as I care nothing for my life. Just now, when you used
                  the word <emph>treachery,</emph> I wished to kill you. Now, you may kill
                     <emph>me,</emph> if you choose, sir—my life is a matter of indifference to me,
                  I am too miserable; but I charge you, on your honor as a gentleman, to absolve my
                  cousin!"</p>
               <p>"Have you done, sir?"</p>
               <p>The brief, stern words rang out suddenly, leaving no doubt of Ruthven's intention.
                  His resolve was unshaken. Hatred, jealousy, blood-thirstiness—all this was written
                  in his eyes.</p>
               <p>"Your lordship is bent on killing me, then?" said Innis, as coldly as before.</p>
               <p>Lord Ruthven's reply was to rush upon his adversary, and to lunge straight at his
                  heart. Innis parried the blow; and a brief combat followed—bitter, desperate,
                  breast to breast. Suddenly Innis's sword snapped, and the foes grappled and
                  fell—Lord Ruthven beneath his adversary. They were body to body, face upon face,
                  panting and bloody. Then Innis uttered a low cry, his hold relaxed, and he fell
                  forward, a torrent of blood gushing from his bosom.</p>
               <p>Ruthven, who had retained his clutch of his sword, had shortened it quickly, and
                  driven the point by main force into his adversary's breast.</p>
               <p>He rose, breathing heavily, and looked at the body lying on the bloody snow.</p>
               <p>All movement had ceased.</p>
               <p>"So much is done," said the nobleman in a low, hollow voice; "now let me go back
                  to my bonny bride!"</p>
               <p>His lip, writhed as he spoke, and the strange wild glitter of the eye was
                  horrible. On this face, resembling a mask of Hate, was written a terrible
                  resolution.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>LIX. THE BRIDAL CHAMBER.</head>
               <p>IT was now eleven o'clock, as all could see by the minute-hand of the great
                  ghostly clock ticking in the hall, and the wedding-guests began to take their
                  departure with many congratulations, addressed to Lord Ruthven and his bride, who
                  stood beside colonel and Lady Brand in the middle of the drawing-room.</p>
               <p>Lord Ruthven was fearfully pale, and the strange glitter of his eyes had not
                  disappeared. He had gained his chamber by the door in the rear, divested himself
                  of his cloak, and descended just as Dr. Vandyke disappeared through a door leading
                  to Meta's chamber, whither he had been summoned hastily by intelligence that the
                  child had been taken suddenly ill.</p>
               <p>A terrible smile passed across Ruthven's pale lips, as the physician disappeared,
                  and he hastened to join the company. The leave-taking was gone through with, and
                  the guests entered their coaches awaiting them in front of the portico. A quarter
                  of an hour afterward the last chariot had rolled away from the door; the members
                  of the household retired; and the great mansion, lately so noisy and brilliant,
                  was as still and dark as a haunted house, from which all human occupants have
                  fled, leaving it to the mysterious tenants of the darkness.</p>
               <p>In this profound and almost painful silence, no sound was heard but the subdued
                  murmur of the river beyond the pine-clad hill, and the measured ticking of the
                  tall clock in the hall; no light was visible but the spectral gleam of the setting
                  moon, which, passing through a narrow window in front of the great door, lit up
                  the white dial-plate of the clock, making it resemble a ghost.</p>
               <p>Slowly the "tick—tick," resounded with a dull, monotonous sound, through the
                  deserted hall—slowly the black hand moved over the white face, second after
                  second, minute after minute.</p>
               <p>"Tick, tick!—tick, tick!"</p>
               <p>It was ten minutes of midnight now.</p>
               <p>The hand crawled slowly, the monotonous sound went on, never faster, never slower,
                  like a metallic fate, careless of what was near at hand.</p>
               <p>"Tick, tick!—tick! tick!"</p>
               <p>It was five minutes of midnight now—four minutes—three minutes—</p>
               <p>The last rays of the moon, dim, mysterious, bloody, were on the ghostly face: the
                  black hand was on the stroke of midnight, when a door opened violently in the
                  direction of Meta's chamber, and Dr. Vandyke rushed into the vacant hall.</p>
               <p>At the same instant, a sudden and terrible scream issued from the chamber of Lady
                  Ruthven.</p>
               <p>The clock struck midnight. As the hammer fell, the door of the bride's chamber
                  opened violently, a dark figure rushed down the staircase nearly overturning the
                  physician, who vainly attempted to grapple with and arrest it—the great door
                  opened and closed with a clash; and past the window of the bridal chamber—past the
                  delicate footprints in the snow—past the oak where a dusky object was stiffening
                  in the freezing winter night—past tree and rock, lit up by the bloody light of the
                  sinking moon—the dark figure, followed headlong now by another figure, disappeared
                  in the gloomy night.</p>
               <p>The second figure was that of Fergus, who, issuing forth from the side-door of the
                  mansion, had hastened with the speed of a deer upon the track of his master.</p>
               <p>The fearful scream from Lady Ruthven's chamber had aroused the entire household.
                  In a few minutes, the upper hall was filled with trembling figures in
                  night-dresses uttering cries, and demanding the origin of the alarm. Through the
                  agitated group, Lady Brand, wrapped in her dressing-robe, hurried to Honoria's
                  chamber, her heart throbbing violently, her cheeks as pale as ashes.</p>
               <p>Through the door-way came a hollow moan. She hastened into the chamber, only
                  illumined by a few chance gleams of the dying fire, and the last red rays of the
                  moon; and, as she did so, heard the low words—</p>
               <p>"Mother! mother!"</p>
               <p>Suddenly she felt her bare feet—for in her haste she had not put on her
                  slippers—touch something moist.</p>
               <p>She stooped—touched the floor—and held up her finger.</p>
               <p>It was blood.</p>
               <p>With a wild, awful cry, she called for lights. They were all ready at the door in
                  the hands of the affrighted household; and a spectacle of unspeakable horror was
                  revealed to all eyes.</p>
               <p>Lady Ruthven was extended upon the couch, which it was obvious she only had
                  occupied—her head hanging back like a wounded bird's, the bosom of her snowy
                  night-dress stained with blood—and the flow of blood had been so profuse that,
                  lying as she did upon the edge of the bed, it had reached the floor, and extended
                  in a long, narrow stream toward the chair before the fire, upon which<pb
                     n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6141-00000073"/> the young lady had deposited her
                  garments when she retired.</p>
               <p>The awful climax to this scene of horror was the hilt of a Highland dirk clearly
                  relieved against the white night-dress, and buried apparently in the young lady's
                  bosom.</p>
               <p>Beneath the head of the young lady was passed the arm of Dr. Vandyke, who,
                  divining in an instant, as Ruthven darted by him, what had happened, had hastened
                  to the chamber and the bedside.</p>
               <p>"O doctor!—what is this?" cried Lady Brand.</p>
               <p>"Murder, madam!" was the hoarse reply.</p>
               <p>Lady Brand, with a low cry, extended her arms toward her child, tottered, and
                  would have fallen, had not Colonel Brand, who hastily entered at the moment,
                  caught her in his arms.</p>
               <p>Such was the spectacle in the bridal chamber. But the family were destined on this
                  night to sup full on horror.</p>
               <p>Colonel Brand, nearly unmanned, bore his wife to a couch, and had just deposited
                  the apparently lifeless form thereon, when violent knocking was heard at the great
                  door of the mansion, and voices loudly demanded admittance.</p>
               <p>A shudder ran through the crowd, and every one listened. The violent knocking
                  continued—there was in its very sound something urgent and terrible—and, seizing a
                  flambeau, Colonel Brand, ashy pale and with compressed lips, hastened down the
                  staircase, threw open the door, and, holding the flambeau aloft, demanded the
                  occasion of the outery.</p>
               <p>No reply was necessary. Borne in the arms of two servants, he saw the body of
                  Edmund Innis—the face deadly pale, the eyes closed, the bosom covered with blood.
                  The servants, chancing to pass by the great oak, on their way to the quarters, had
                  been startled by a groan—fled with superstitious fear at first; but, summoning
                  courage, had returned to the spot, and discovered Innis stretched in a pool of
                  blood upon the snow. They had hastily raised him—borne him between them to the
                  "great house," and knocked loudly at the door to summon assistance.</p>
               <p>Colonel Brand uttered a low groan, as the servants explained in hurried words how
                  and where they had found the body. He could only gasp out an order that the dying
                  man should be brought in. He then went back, wellnigh broken-hearted, to his
                  daughter's chamber.</p>
               <p>As he crossed the threshold, he staggered in his gait, but all at once his eyes
                  expanded with a sort of joy. Lady Brand was holding the head of Honoria upon her
                  bosom, and the young lady was sobbing. Dr. Vandyke, crouching down, was rapidly
                  applying bandages to the wound. On the floor, whither he had hurled it, lay a
                  hideous object—the bloody weapon drawn by the physician from the body of the
                  girl.</p>
               <p>It had not entered her bosom, toward which the murderous hand had no doubt
                  directed it—it slipped, or the hand was unsteady; the point had only pierced the
                  white arm beneath the shoulder. A profuse flow of blood had taken place, but the
                  wound was merely dangerous, not necessarily mortal; and, under the skilful hand of
                  Dr. Vandyke, the blood soon ceased to flow.</p>
               <p>In a few words, Colonel Brand informed Dr. Vandyke of the discovery of Innis's
                  body. A start and a strange glance greeted the intelligence of this additional
                  tragedy.</p>
               <p>"The devil is let loose, then!" he muttered, in his harsh metallic
                     voice—"<emph>both fulfilled to the letter!</emph>"</p>
               <p>And, with these singular words, the physician turned and said:</p>
               <p>"Honoria is easy for the present. Where is he—Edmund Innis?"</p>
               <p>He was conducted to the chamber, where the young man had been laid upon on a bed,
                  nearly but not quite insensible. "A hideous business, truly!" muttered the
                  physician, tearing away the clothes from the young man's breast, and examining the
                  wound, around which the blood had coagulated in the intensely cold night. "This
                  one will die, I think—the lung pierced—"</p>
               <p>He called for hot water, washed the wound, bandaged it, and, giving directions to
                  an old nurse to remain with Innis, went back to Honoria's chamber. All eyes were
                  turned toward him, including Honoria's, who breathed regularly now.</p>
               <p>"A bad wound, but not mortal," he said; "and now this young lady must go to sleep.
                  All will please leave this chamber but Lady Brand."</p>
               <p>The agitated group disappeared, Dr. Vandyke going out last with Colonel Brand.</p>
               <p>As the door closed, their eyes met.</p>
               <p>"The meaning of all this! the meaning, doctor?" groaned the colonel, ghastly
                  pale.</p>
               <p>"Simple," was the reply. "Your daughter married, as I told you, a madman."</p>
               <p>"Good Heavens!—and—this poor boy—?"</p>
               <p>"They fought, or the madman struck him in the dark."</p>
               <p>"And—?"</p>
               <p>"Will he die, you mean?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes!"</p>
               <p>"In three days. Honoria's hurt is slight, comparatively. The boy's is mortal. I
                  give him three days!"</p>
               <p>An hour afterward, a further discovery was made, which put the finishing touch to
                  this night of horrors. What had become of Lord Ruthven and his body-servant? Dr.
                  Vandyke recalled the violent collision with Lord Ruthven on the staircase, as he
                  rushed toward the front-door; and the servants who had discovered the body of
                  Innis, reported that they had seen two dark figures—one apparently in pursuit of
                  the other—hastening in the direction of the hills skirting the river. This
                  intelligence left little doubt that Lord Ruthven had attempted or committed
                  suicide; and a party, supplied with torches, followed the footsteps, plain in the
                  snow, toward the point in question. The steps were evidently those of Lord Ruthven
                  and his servant, whose ponderous boots had left very different traces from those
                  of his master.</p>
               <p>The double footprints crossed the snow-covered expanse of the lawn—led by the oak
                  where the combat had taken place—were traced on the other side of the enclosure
                  around the grounds, through the melancholy wilderness of evergreens beyond, and
                  ceased abruptly upon the summit of a rock, beneath which the river—hemmed in
                  between high banks—rushed with great rapidity through its deep and narrow channel.
                  Here, <emph>on the brink of the awful precipice</emph>—to use the very words of
                  Lord Ruthven, uttered to Fergus at Williamsburg—were found the traces apparently
                  of a violent struggle. The snow was trampled and the footprints of master and
                  servant were clearly distinguishable, intermingled in such a manner as to leave
                  little doubt that they had grappled with each other. The fact was plain that both
                  had fallen or thrown themselves into the stream; and this proved to be the truth.
                  Two hundred yards down the bank, the bodies of Lord Ruthven and Fergus were
                  discovered—both were dead—the arms of the clansman clasping his chieftain, as
                  though he had died in the effort to save him.</p>
               <p>This was all that was ever known. Had the two committed suicide? Or, in the
                  struggle, had they fallen into the rushing stream, and been drowned? There was no
                  means of determining the question.</p>
               <p>The bodies were borne back to Rivanna. On the next day they were interred<pb
                     n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6141-00000074"/> terred side by side in the graveyard
                  attached to the parish church some miles distant. Death had thus not separated
                  them, and Fergus lay where he would have chosen, beside his master.</p>

               <head>LX. THE STATEMENT AND THE PAPER.</head>
               <p>NOTHING, in reference to the events of this fearful night, between the moment when
                  Honoria retired to the time when her screams aroused the household, was ever
                  accurately known, except by three persons. These persons bound themselves, it is
                  said, by a solemn obligation, not to speak upon so painful and terrible a subject.
                  But, in spite of that fact, a rumor, in time, began to creep about. Some
                  indiscreet listener had overheard, perchance, some words uttered in supposed
                  privacy; and, link by link, detail by detail, the mystery was, or professed to be,
                  revealed.</p>
               <p>This whispered rumor, for want of better information, is here given. Of its
                  accuracy, the reader will form his own opinion.</p>
               <p>Honoria's statement was, that she had retired, on her wedding-night, at a
                  quarter-past eleven; a fact which she remembered, as she had glanced at the clock
                  in the hall as she went toward the great staircase. She was, at this hour,
                  completely exhausted, and nearly sunk down from pure weakness and agitation, as
                  her bridesmaids assisted her in making her night-toilet. The young ladies had then
                  left her apartment; she retired to bed, fell into a morbid state, half sleeping,
                  half waking; but was suddenly aroused by a horrible breathing, apparently issuing
                  from behind the curtains of her bed, identical with that heard on the night when
                  she had performed the ceremony of eating the dumb-cake. This sound, she stated,
                  filled her with such fright that she nearly fainted, and only remembered what
                  followed, as human beings remember dreams. She saw, or fancied she saw, the fire
                  slowly die away, and darkness invade the chamber. The only light now was that of
                  the blood-red moon, which shone through the western window, throwing upon the
                  opposite wall the shadow of one of the boughs of the great oak opposite the
                  window; and this shadow, as before, assumed the appearance of a gigantic arm, the
                  hand grasping a dagger.</p>
               <p>From this moment she recalled little, and that as a sort of dream, full of terror.
                  Lord Ruthven seemed to stand at her bedside, his face as pale as death, his lips
                  writhing, and his eyes fearfully bright. In his hand he grasped a dagger, such as
                  she had seen in the dumb-cake dream, and exclaiming, in a hollow tone, "False!
                  false! false!" he had crouched, lifted his arm; the weapon had gleamed in the red
                  moonlight, and a hot iron seemed suddenly to pass through her shoulder, whereupon
                  she had lost consciousness, only to be aroused by the entrance of her mother.</p>
               <p>Such was the narrative attributed to the young lady, and there was little reason
                  to discredit it, with the exception of the asserted identity between the real
                  poniard which had inflicted the wound, and that seen in the dream on the night of
                  the dumb-cake. That Honoria believed the two to be identical in appearance is
                  certain. When the weapon was shown to her she swooned, and, as soon as she opened
                  her eyes, begged those around her to remove it, as she <emph>had seen it
                     before.</emph> It is certain, at least, that this idea of the identity of the
                  real and fanciful weapon had taken strong possession of the young lady's mind; and
                  a paper, discovered in a drawer of the chamber occupied by Lord Ruthven, directed
                  to Colonel Brand, is said to have strongly corroborated this strange idea.</p>
               <p>To this paper—which was the same shown by Lord Ruthven to Dr. Vandyke—we now pass.
                  For reasons, of which he declared himself, in brief words, to be the best judge,
                  Colonel Brand, after reading this paper, proceeded at once to destroy it by
                  holding it in the flame of a candle until it was reduced to ashes. He never
                  afterward alluded to it to any member of his household; but, either through
                  himself or through Dr. Vandyke, its purport became known, or professed to be
                  known. Here, as before, recourse must be had to rumor—that ambiguous but often
                  accurate version of secret occurrences which so frequently creeps about.</p>
               <p>It was said that, in this paper, Lord Ruthven sought to vindicate himself in
                  advance from the charge of blood-thirstiness, in the event of the commission by
                  himself of a terrible crime. In order to thus relieve his memory of a portion at
                  least of the guilt, he presented a history of his life. He declared himself to be
                  the representative of an ancient Scottish family, which had possessed, time out of
                  mind, the fearful gift of the "second-sight"—a faculty which enabled them to look
                  into the future, and thus foresee the events of their own lives. The consciousness
                  of this fatal gift had, he declared, afforded him, from his earliest years,
                  unspeakable wretchedness. His character had been naturally genial and cheerful;
                  this fearful faculty had made him harsh, irritable, and melancholy. He had
                  struggled long and obstinately to divert his mind of all belief in it—had striven
                  to laugh at it as an absurd superstition, instilled into him by the old Highland
                  crone who had nursed him, and told him frightful stories from his cradle; but all
                  was vain. The fearful <emph>proof</emph> was there to falsify his hopes. In his
                  dreams he had foreseen events which duly and literally came to pass, <emph>in
                     spite of every effort which he made to prevent their occurrence.</emph> This
                  was the terrible part. He could not resist this secret fate, driving him to fulfil
                  the visions. Of this statement, Lord Ruthven presented several instances. He had
                  had a favorite hound. A vision told him that the hound would perish by his hand,
                  and to avoid this painful event he had presented the animal to a neighboring
                  friend, with the injunction to keep him out of his (Lord Ruthven's) sight. The
                  hound had, nevertheless, perished by his own knife. He was deer-hunting—the animal
                  was driven to bay, and he had dismounted and thrown himself upon the stag,
                  struggling with the dogs, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">couteau de chasse</foreign> in
                  hand, and struck at his throat. Instead of the deer's throat, the knife entered
                  the breast of one of the dogs. It was his favorite, who, hearing the cry of his
                  old companions on the hills, had joined in the hunt, and thus met his death, in
                  accordance with the vision.</p>
               <p>A second instance was similar. He had a riding-horse of great beauty and speed,
                  though so violent at times that he was dangerous. He was his favorite of the whole
                  stud; and when he one night had a vision, in which he saw <emph>himself</emph>
                  shoot the animal dead, he awoke depressed and sorrowful. This time he swore to
                  disappoint the devil; and, without delay, sent the animal by a reliable groom to
                  an English nobleman, his friend, residing more than three hundred miles distant,
                  requesting him to accept the horse. A note of thanks for so fine an animal came
                  back. Ruthven forgot the incident; but a year afterward was visiting in
                  Perthshire, when, in a paddock attached to the mansion of his host, he saw the
                  horse, dragging a groom by the bridle and pawing at him. Whence had the animal
                  come? he asked. The reply was that Lord—was coming for the hunting-season, and had
                  sent this horse to await his arrival. This explanation had scarcely been given,
                  when the groom was thrown to the earth, and the animal tore him with his<pb
                     n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6141-00000075"/> teeth, and rose on his hind-legs to paw
                  him to death. Ruthven was just going out grouse-shooting, and had his
                  fowling-piece in his hand. It was a choice between the life of the man and the
                  life of the horse. He discharged the contents of his fowling-piece into the animal
                  behind the shoulder—he rolled over, tore up the grass with his teeth, and expired.
                  The man was saved; but Ruthven returned to the house, bade his friend farewell,
                  and went back sorrowfully to his castle. He had fulfilled the second vision.</p>
               <p>This had made him wellnigh lose all hope, and surrender himself to despair. But a
                  blessed discontinuance of the visions succeeded. For many years he slept
                     tranquilly—<emph>saw</emph> nothing—and began to hope that Heaven had
                  mercifully exempted him from further torture. The visions came no more; he
                  attained the age of twenty-five—when all at once he began to <emph>see</emph>
                  vaguely the forms of a young man and a young lady, in connection with whom some
                  terrible event was to occur, in which event he was to act the chief part. Filled
                  with horror at this vague (and more frightful because vague) vision, he determined
                  to leave Scotland; and that for a double reason. The popular belief in connection
                  with the fearful gift of second-sight was, that those afflicted with it had only
                  to leave their own land and travel, to lose the faculty. This was the main reason
                  inducing him to resolve upon a prolonged absence from Scotland. Another was to
                  seek in travel, society, cards, dissipation, if necessary, relief from his
                  frightful visions. Still a third reason for visiting the Continent was to allay a
                  foreboding, which had for some time chilled him—the fancy that, perhaps, after
                  all, he was simply a person of unsound mind—the apparent fulfilment of his
                  visions, in the cases of the dog and the horse, being only coincidences. In
                  accordance with the resolution formed, he left Scotland, went to Paris, plunged
                  into gay society, and found his visions disappear.</p>
               <p>The question of his sanity remained; and he laid his "case," without reservation
                  or concealment of any description, before some of the most celebrated physicians
                  of Europe, who declared, over their own names, in a written paper, that Lord
                  Ruthven was, in their opinion, a person of somewhat morbid and excitable
                  organization, but, in point of sanity or insanity of mind, no more insane than
                  themselves. This had proved an enormous relief to him. Then, he was simply
                  "excitable"—torturing himself with "morbid" fancies; the second-sight was a
                  chimera! He would, therefore, return home, and laugh at his visions. This
                  resolution was followed by a return to Scotland. For a brief time, no visions
                  disturbed him; but then they returned in a more aggravated form than before. The
                  vagueness had now quite disappeared—all was clear-cut, and distinct. He
                     <emph>saw</emph> a young man and a young lady whose blood was to be shed by
                  himself. The young lady was to be his bride—the young gentleman was his
                  unsuccessful rival. They were to inhabit a region diversified by mountains—those
                  of Scotland, apparently. The tragedy was to grow out of the preference of the
                  young lady for his poorer rival. She was to prove false to him by granting, on his
                  very wedding-night, a stolen and criminal interview to this rival. They were to
                  fight in the snow—the rival was to fall; then, he, Ruthven, was to go to the
                  bridal chamber, strike his Highland dirk into the bosom of the bride; and
                  afterward commit self-destruction by throwing himself from a precipice, crowned
                  with evergreens, into a swollen torrent.</p>
               <p>Such was to be his fate—this was his future: love, murder, and suicide!</p>
               <p>In unutterable horror, he determined to fly from Scotland, which he supposed to be
                  the scene of the future tragedy—for the precipice, the evergreens, the swollen
                  torrent, all seemed to indicate, with sufficient exactness, the locality. This
                  time he resolved that he would cheat Fate itself of its prey: he would leave the
                  accursed scene of future crime forever. An opportunity to do so unexpectedly
                  presented itself. His friend Lord Botetourt was appointed Governor of
                  Virginia—beyond the ocean was safety. He at once applied for permission to join
                  the suite of the new governor—readily received it; sailed for Virginia; and
                  breathed freely once more, with the delightful consciousness that he had outrun
                  the haunting Fate.</p>
               <p>His comfort was short-lived. Riding one day at full gallop along Gloucester
                  Street, in Williamsburg, his horse had shied suddenly; he was unseated and
                  fell—losing his senses by the fall. When he regained consciousness, he saw before
                  him the young gentleman <emph>seen in his vision in Scotland!</emph> The sight of
                  the youth overcame him with horror; and he had but one hope—that this was a
                     <emph>coincidence</emph> only; that he had met with this young gentleman, Mr.
                  Innis, in Europe, and hence the recognition of him. He had accordingly questioned
                  him, and discovered that no such meeting could have taken place, as Mr. Innis had
                  never visited Europe—thus he was certain that they had never before met. Upon this
                  discovery, his resolution was promptly taken. As Virginia was to be the scene of
                  his crime, he would instantly leave the country, as he had left Scotland; and he
                  gave prompt orders to have his trunks gotten ready for his departure. The
                  departure had not taken place. First, there was a difficulty about a vessel; then
                  the governor begged him to delay; then Mr. Innis left Williamsburg, and all danger
                  for the moment was plainly over.</p>
               <p>The second identification followed. At the governor's assembly he saw enter the
                  room <emph>the young lady of his vision</emph>—his bride and victim to be. Thereat
                  his horror had been overwhelming. He sought to avoid even an introduction to her;
                  but circumstances rendered it necessary; he had danced with her, visited her,
                  conceived an ardent passion for her; and thus completely lost the power of leaving
                  her. He had not sufficient strength to do so; but soothed his agitation, at
                  thought of the vision, by swearing that he would put an end to his own life,
                  before he would do harm to the young girl whom he loved so dearly. Thenceforward
                  things took their course. He proposed for Honoria's hand, was accepted by her
                  father, the time was fixed—and, to crown his happiness, Mr. Innis, the
                  unsuccessful lover of the young lady, was perfectly resigned to his fate, and
                  about to leave the country. Thus, the hated <emph>visions</emph> were a
                  cheat—second-sight a farce, after all—he would be happily married, do harm to no
                  one, and, in the sunshine of love, forget all his past sorrows.</p>
               <p>But, if his Fate still hunted him down—if some hidden hand drove him on to
                  conceive the possibility of such crimes as he had <emph>seen</emph> himself
                  commit, he would stop on the threshold, perish by his own hand; and this paper,
                  addressed to Colonel Brand, would be the explanation and vindication of the
                  tragedy.</p>
               <p>Such were the alleged contents of Lord Ruthven's narrative. How the terrible
                  sequel was brought about has been recorded.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>EPILOGUE.</head>
               <p>FOR three months the life of Innis seemed suspended by a hair, which the hand of a
                  child—the least breath—would break.</p>
               <p>His wound then began slowly to heal, and, in the last days of May, he rose, pale,
                  thin, and tottering, from his bed, entering the world thus once more, as it were,
                  from the postern of the grave.</p>
               <pb n="142-143 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC6141-00000076"/>
               <p>Honoria had completely recovered from her wound some time before; and the terrible
                  events of her wedding-night began to relax their painful hold upon her mind. She
                  looked back now to those events as to a fearful dream, from which she had
                  awakened; and the May sunshine saw the roses once more blooming in her cheeks.</p>
               <p>That she and Innis were married in due time, we need scarcely assure the reader.
                  Of the will of Colonel Seaton there was no question at all. Colonel Brand had duly
                  recorded it in the proper court, surrendered Rivanna to Innis, gave him the hand
                  of Honoria—and all lived in peace and harmony under a single roof.</p>
               <p>On the night of Honoria's marriage to Innis, Miss Lou Brand bestowed her queenly
                  hand upon Mr. Phil Cary. It was a happy double wedding, and even Mrs. Cary, who
                  was present, and in the seat of honor, was overjoyed at the happiness of her
                  son.</p>
               <p>Side by side, near the married couples, stood two persons who have frequently
                  appeared in this history—Meta and Dr. Vandyke.</p>
               <p>With the termination of the tragedy, so long overshadowing Rivanna, Meta had begun
                  to recover her strength, and to regain the roses in her cheeks. It seemed a
                  miracle, this return to life, and, what was far better than life, the blessed
                  light of reason. No more, now, a subtle, scheming, mad girl, burnt up by a morbid
                  jealousy, but a gentle and tender woman, moved by all sweet influences and kindly
                  emotions, Meta stood beside Honoria, as one of her bridesmaids, smiling and
                  beautiful—in her dark curls the spring flowers she thought she should never more
                  see.</p>
               <p>And Dr. Vandyke—the cynical, bitter, large-hearted, profound, and clownish
                  personage—Dr. Vandyke had come all the way, from Williamsburg to be present at the
                  wedding, which he had contemplated with a grin, and spiced with an allusion to
                  Mrs. Snuffers, a venerable personage, whom he believed to be bent on marrying him.
                  As the night drew on, and the long hours fled by like birds into the darkness, the
                  with and satire of Dr. Vandyke sparkled more and more.</p>
               <p>Beside the great punch-bowl, and occasionally waving the ladle around his head, he
                  resembled some eccentric goblin, and there was something weird about his laughter.
                  But, toward midnight this merriment disappeared—the face of this strange man grew
                  deeply sorrowful. With his eyes fixed upon the great, clock, whose hand approached
                  twelve, the doctor fell into a reverie, and sighed.</p>
               <p>Phil Cary laid a hand upon his shoulder, and cried:</p>
               <p>"What are you thinking of, doctor?"</p>
               <p>Dr. Vandyke uttered a deeper sigh than before.</p>
               <p>"Poor Ruthven!" he muttered.</p>

               Fenimore Cooper's Novels, in a form designed for general popular circulation. The
               Series will begin with the famous "Leather-Stocking Tales," five in number, and will
               be published in the following order, at intervals of about a month:</p>

            <p>This edition of the "Leather-Stocking Tales" will be printed in handsome octavo
               volumes, from new stereotype plates, each volume superbly and fully illustrated with

            <p>Heretofore there has been no edition of the acknowledged head of American romancists
               suitable for general popular circulation, and hence the new issue of these famous

               Cooper departed from us. As time progresses, the character, genius, and value of the
               Cooper romances become more widely recognized; he is now accepted as the great
               classic of our American literature, and his books as the prose epics of our early

            <p>"Good-bye, Sweetheart!" is certainly one of the brightest and most entertaining
               novels that has appeared for many years. The heroine of the story, Lenore, is really
               an original character, drawn only as a woman could draw her, who had looked deeply
               into the mysterious recesses of the feminine heart. She is a creation totally beyond
               the scope of a man's pen, unless it were the pen of Shakespeare. Her beauty, her
               wilfulness, her caprice, her love, and her sorrow, are depicted with marvellous
               skill, and invested with an interest of which the reader never becomes weary. Miss
               Broughton, in this work, has made an immense advance on her other stories, clever as
               those are. Her sketches of scenery and of interiors, though brief, are eminently
               graphic, and the dialogue is always sparkling and witty. The incidents, though
               sometimes startling and unexpected, are very natural, and the characters and story,
               from the beginning to the end, strongly enchain the attention of the reader.</p>
