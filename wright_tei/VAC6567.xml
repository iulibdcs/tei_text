               <p>WALK with me along this by-path which leads through the wood, and I will introduce you to a scene which shall be a key-note to all that follows in these pages. There is a peculiar charm in its windings and turnings, as we go forward, which always fills me with strange and pleasing emotions. Wild flowers are blooming along its borders and filling the air with their fragrance, bowing their gentle heads to the summer breeze which comes sighing through the aged forest, loading it with sweet perfumes more rare than any ever connected by human ingenuity. Gnarled and twisted old trees cross and recross our path, interlacing their branches in inextricable confusion over our heads, and here and there gray old rocks catch the rays of the sun as they descend through the net-work of foliage above, and stand out in bold relief against the shadowed back-ground. The joyous birds are singing from every branch, and their voices, returning in echoes from the deep glades of the forest, fill the very air with gladness, which finds a happy response in our own hearts. Far away the busy thrum of the woodpecker, as he beats his merry tattoo upon the withered branch of some old tree, dies with hollow reverberations, and is lost in the distance. Here a little brook comes dashing down through a dark ravine, from the mountain<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6567-00000005"/> ain side, adding its happy voice to the song of the birds and the whispering of the breezes, and its bright smile, as it here and there reflects the joyous sunbeams, lifts our overburdened hearts to the throne of HIM who has surrounded us with so much that reminds us of His power and goodness, in presenting to every sense scenes of loveliness and of grandeur, which shall leave us no escape from the conviction that these are substantial evidences of design, and not the result of mere chance, as many would have us believe; evidences which need not the aid of revelation to bring conviction to every heart that is not deadened by the corrupting influences that surround us, or corroded by self-imposed cares and struggles for the attainment of objects from which we realize nothing here, and which are wholly worthless hereafter, let that hereafter be what it may. These venerable trees, these hoary rocks, the sighing winds, the laughing brook, the song of the birds, the fragrance of the flowers, are but the mediums through which Deity appeals to the souls of men, and constantly strives to keep alive our better feelings and impulses.</p>
               <p>We will turn aside from our path and walk up the bed of the little stream, as it noisily dashes by—a beautiful emblem of human life—here and there struggling madly to overcome some obstacle, then gliding on again as joyously and with gentle murmurs as though its pure current had never been checked or disturbed in its course. The scene becomes more wild and beautiful as we clamber up the ravine. Bold cliffs rise upon either hand, covered with wild vines and endless varieties of fern. Huge rocks, torn from above us, lie around in every conceivable shape, and the roar of the water, as it plunges over a precipice some distance farther up, now reaches our ears, and quickens our steps to catch the first glimpse of the foaming water as it leaps into the abyss below; now we have it in full view, and the imagination could scarcely picture anything which would rival its beauty, as the little stream at its base is lashed into foam by the force of the descending waters, and brings into bold relief the large masses of rock that are grouped in picturesque confusion between us and it.</p>
               <p>Just there, upon that large flat rock, are seated two figures, both busily engaged in sketching the magnificent scene before them. The elder of the two appears to be some thirty-four or five years old, and his whole air indicates the practiced artist. The rapid manner in which he dashes down what is before him, is in striking contrast with the cautious pencilings of the younger, who is a lad of about sixteen years, and seems, from the frequent use he makes of his India-rubber, to struggle with many difficulties. After each rubbing, however, he returns to his labor without any manifestation of impatience, and works with that kind of devotion in his manner, that gives promise of two qualities which will insure success—<emph>patience</emph> and <emph>love.</emph> His fine face is full of genius, and the soul which looks out through his large blue eyes seems to be filled with delight in his occupation, and there is that kind of dreamy forgetfulness of self—that entire love for the grand and beautiful—in every expression, that indicates the embryo artist.</p>
               <p>"Is not water in violent motion, Mr. Grattan, one of the most difficult things to represent?"</p>
               <p>"Everything is difficult, Hugo, until a long-practiced hand obeys the dictates of the soul. But water, perhaps, baffles us more than anything else, except the ever-changing sky, both of which present but little that is fixed and tangible, and their constantly varying features must be caught instantly, if at all! You must not be discouraged," he continued, looking over the youth's shoulder; "your rocks and foliage are exceedingly well drawn, and you have manifested great feeling in the arrangement of the light and shade."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I am not at all discouraged, Mr. Grattan; but I did not know but that your answer to my question might convey some information which would aid me."</p>
               <p>"Trust to no information from any source save the school of nature, my boy. If I were to give you ever so clear an idea of <emph>my</emph> manner of producing effects, and you should prove an apt pupil, you would be but an imitator after all, and my pains in the end would only smother the bright fire of your<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6567-00000006"/> genius, which, following its own dictates, may one day far outstrip me."</p>
               <p>"Oh, you flatter me, Mr. Grattan; I shall be perfectly happy if I can ever paint as well as you do."</p>
               <p>"No, I do not flatter you—I take a great interest in you, and I feel the importance to you, of understanding as early as possible the value of out-door study, which alone can be made available to you in all the higher walks of art; and the entire worthlessness of the common practice of copying. The ideas of color, light, shade, and aerial perspective that you get in this way, you can always depend upon as correct; but the ideas of any man, unless tried and proved by this standard, are valueless."</p>
               <p>"I feel the obligations your kind lessons put me under," the boy replied, "and I shall adopt your practice in future, and go only to nature for my ideas, whatever may be said about improving nature."</p>
               <p>"The most ridiculous nonsense, and only advocated by those who are mannerists themselves, and feeling incapable of being anything better, wish to drag the whole world of Art down to their own level. It would have been far better for the advancement of Art, if the nonsense published upon this subject by Sir Joshua Reynolds and others of the <emph>High-Art</emph> School had died with them."</p>
               <p>"Do you not believe Sir Joshua was sincere?"</p>
               <p>"The best evidences of his insincerity are to be found in his own works, which are, one and all, borrowed ideas from the old masters. There is not the slightest elevation in one of his works, and better artists than himself were starving in London, while he, by degrading art to a trade and prating loudly about the 'grand style,' was overloaded with the favors of the English aristocracy. He excelled in nothing except, perhaps, in color, and his superiority here was principally mechanical."</p>
               <p>"You do not believe, then, that nature can be improved?"</p>
               <p>"The whole idea is false, unless one is endowed with the power to create something that never existed before. All our ideas are derived from something we have seen or felt, and must be based upon <emph>truth,</emph> to the teachings thus received from nature."</p>
               <p>"But, Mr. Grattan, must I always paint things just as I see them before me? Could I not improve them by taking liberties in some minor points, by adding something here and leaving something out in another place? Could I not many times improve a scene by putting it in a different effect of light and shade from what I see it, as I have done here in this drawing?"</p>
               <p>"Well, you may do all this, and in doing so, evince some of the highest attributes of the artist; but all that you add to your picture must bear the stamp of reality. You may vary your effects as much as you please, and in doing this, you do nothing that nature might not do, and, of course, you do not <emph>improve</emph> nature. You may improve the effect in a particular scene; but your improvements must have been studied from nature, or they are no improvements; they must be nature still. Do you understand my proposition?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes—I see now—I think I understand you—and you have cleared the whole thing up to me. How beautiful!" he exclaimed, a glow of enthusiasm lighting up his features. "And how clear! Now, if I wished to throw a shadow across the top of the water-fall there, instead of the bottom, as we see it, for the sake of improving the beauty of the scene, I could do so?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly," Mr. Grattan replied, "if you can account for your shadow by giving some natural cause for it—a passing cloud, or some projecting mass of foliage which breaks the light—all which liberties, however, must be founded in truth."</p>
               <p>"How beautiful!" the boy exclaimed again; "and this explains the whole theory of effect."</p>
               <p>"I am glad, Hugo, that you understand me so well; it evinces a keen perception of the beautiful, which will enable you to surmount difficulties that would appall many who consider themselves among the gifted."</p>
               <p>"If I could only enjoy this beautiful world you have opened up to me, Mr. Grattan," the boy said, his countenance suddenly<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6567-00000007"/> denly assuming a saddened expression—"if I could only enjoy this beautiful world to the extent of my yearnings, I should be <emph>so</emph> happy."</p>
               <p>"Why can you not, Hugo? What is to prevent?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, you don't know how unhappy I am at times; my father does not like my indulging in this kind of foolishness, as he calls it, and seems to have some plan of life prepared for me which I am certain I shall not like."</p>
               <p>"A merchant, perhaps?" said Grattan, with a slight curl of the lip.</p>
               <p>"Something of that sort, I am afraid, for he is lately constantly talking to me about forming business habits, and calls all the pursuits which I enjoy—music, drawing, painting, reading—idling away time."</p>
               <p>"Well, my boy, for all the practical good that these pursuits will do you, I am afraid that your father is right; and the world at large would think much better of you if you were making money in any of the legalized methods of swindling, than they ever will as an artist."</p>
               <p>"Would you advise me, then, Mr. Grattan, to quit drawing, and turn my attention to some other pursuit?"</p>
               <p>"Well, Hugo, since you ask me for advice, I must candidly tell you I would. A talent for painting, for music, or a taste for reading, are things which the world will not appreciate or reward; but the genius for making money will command friends in every part of the world."</p>
               <p>"But what good will money do me, if I am not happy?" the boy continued. "I can not learn how to make money, and I shall only be happy as an artist."</p>
               <p>"Well, my boy, if this is true, you have but to fulfill your destiny; but by the time you have reached my age you will understand many things which I can not make clear to you now. You will by that time have learned many bitter lessons that I have learned, and will almost curse the day that you were born."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Mr. Grattan," said the boy, taking his hand and looking up into his face, "you must not talk so; you are unhappy now, and to see you so, makes me unhappy. Do you not enjoy our sketching rambles as much as I do? I know you do—for I have noticed how happy you always appear to be when we are over the hills, or in the woods together, and I do not believe that you would be a merchant any more than I."</p>
               <p>"Hugo," Mr. Grattan replied, "you are right; I would not exchange my glorious profession for any other on earth, but this does not alter the case. In a world which rewards nothing but knavery, men know but little and care less for such feelings as animate you and me. But," he said, looking up the ravine, "the girls are coming back, and I will not put any more of my sourness into your young head; it will come fast enough."</p>
               <p>The boy put his sketches into his portfolio and arose to go, as the girls alluded to came running up to them with their arms full of flowers, wild vines, and fern, and exhibiting in their whole bearing that healthful joyousness which results from frequent exercise in the open air. After exhibiting their trophies to Hugo and Mr. Grattan, the portfolios had to be reopened, and the sketches examined and admired with youthful enthusiasm, after which the party commenced their descent of the ravine on their way homeward, the two girls leading the way, their merry voices waking the echoes of the surrounding forest, as they gave vent to their feelings in laugh or song, with hearts as light and free from care as the birds that chirruped and sang from the branches over their heads.</p>
               <p>Hugo and his friend, with feelings somewhat saddened by their recent conversation, walked more soberly forward, but both dwelt with looks of affection upon the artless gambols of the two girls, and occasionally indulged in a smile at their gay sallies of wit or disjointed snatches of song, which, strung together medley fashion, in defiance of all rules, seemed to afford them infinite amusement. I have often looked upon pairs of beautiful light-hearted little girls as they danced home from school, or romped upon the play-ground in thoughtless glee, and had my heart saddened by the reflection that these<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6567-00000008"/> happy little innocents were hastening forward to that realization of blasted hopes and happy dreams, which has been the experience of all the sons and daughters of Adam since the world began.</p>
               <p>Some such reflections as these were perhaps passing through the mind of Mr. Grattan, for his countenance had gradually become sadder and sadder as they proceeded, and Hugo's also betrayed that his were not of the most pleasant character, as he said to Mr. Grattan:</p>
               <p>"What a pity that your daughter and my sister could not always be as happy as they are now!"</p>
               <p>"So I was just thinking, Hugo; but it is pleasant to see them happy, no matter how brief may be its duration; and it would be cruel, if it were possible, to picture to them the sorrows which must come upon their more mature years."</p>
               <p>"But why, Mr. Grattan, should the world be necessarily so unhappy, when God has filled it with so much that is grand and lovely, and is so constantly appealing through His works to our better natures?"</p>
               <p>"Because, my dear boy," Mr. Grattan answered, "man has set his foot upon this fair heritage but to mar it, and until men are made better, happiness in this world is but a mere name."</p>
               <p>Hugo again relapsed into silence. The words of Mr. Grattan already began to vibrate upon a sympathetic chord in his own heart, and he did not know how far to trust himself to listen to such sentiments as these. He <emph>would</emph> be happy—like all youthful hearts, his, too, yearned for happiness—and his nature was full of the elements to insure it, but something seemed to whisper him that the words of Mr. Grattan were prophetic, and he questioned him no further; but rather chose to make an effort to change the current of his feelings, by calling the attention of his companion to a beautiful scene which now opened out before them, and which both paused to admire.</p>
               <p>Glimpses of a little village peeping out from masses of foliage—a glassy lake, dotted with many sails, and bounded in by noble mountains, with a broken foreground of oak and chestnut, whose sturdy forms had breasted the storms of centuries, with rocks and herbage in such picturesque arrangement as to turn an artist's brain—appealed to the ruling passion of their natures, and Hugo and Mr. Grattan were soon again seated with pencils busy at work. Artist-like, they had thrown care and sorrow to the winds, while absorbed in admiration of the beautiful panorama outspread before them, and the hands of each were busy in giving expression to the various objects contained in the picture. Thus they worked on, the silence only disturbed by an occasional outburst of enthusiasm on the part of the boy, when they were suddenly interrupted by the return of Hugo's sister, who came breathlessly panting up the slope where they sat, and did not pause until she had ran up to him, and, placing her hand upon his shoulder, exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Quick, Hugo! quick! put these up; I saw father and Mr. Burton coming up the road, and father will scold you again, if he finds you engaged in this way."</p>
               <p>The countenance of the boy grew crimson at this announcement, and he sprang to his feet suddenly, with the air of one who had been caught in some criminal act, and crammed into his portfolio again, sketches, pencils, and paper, with such haste as to seriously endanger them, and walking up to Mr. Grattan, said to him:</p>
               <p>"Please, Mr. Grattan, put up your sketches, and do not let father suspect what we have been doing."</p>
               <p>Mr. Grattan arose slowly to his feet, and, placing his drawings out of sight, took Hugo by the hand and said to him kindly, but with earnest firmness:</p>
               <p>"My boy, this is but a poor plan to adopt with your father. To say nothing of the impropriety of deceiving him, it is only putting off the evil day which must come sooner or later if you continue to practice your art. Be manly, Hugo; meet your father with your portfolio under your arm, and if he is harsh and unkind, you will at least be conscious of having acted your true character."</p>
               <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6567-00000009"/>
               <p>Here Hugo's sister, seeing the force of Mr. Grattan's remarks, ran up to him and seconded these suggestions, so perfectly in accordance with her own truthful nature, which had, like her brother's, only been warped by fear of harsh reproof from the father. But the advice of Mr. Grattan, as well as his sister Louise, might have been spared, for it was now too late to conceal the nature of his occupation, even if he would. Mr. Blanc and Mr. Burton, preceded by Mary Grattan, at this moment appeared at a turn of the road only a few rods from where they stood.</p>
               <p>Hugo had no time to recover himself to meet his father, and the blended feelings of fear and surprise at this unexpected interruption, and mortification at the reproof of Mr. Grattan, which, gentle though it was, had cut to the quick, exhibited themselves upon his countenance and in his manner, as Mr. Blanc and Mr. Burton joined the party. Louise had instinctively sought her brother's side, and now stood leaning upon his arm, her eyes eagerly watching her father's countenance as he approached; while Hugo, poor fellow, hung his head like a culprit about to receive his sentence. Mr. Grattan had seated himself, with his daughter by his side, upon a large stone, and awaited the termination of the coming interview with the air of a man who feels himself in an unpleasant dilemma, but has no choice between the horns. He could not leave abruptly without seeming to desire to avoid whatever of censure might be attached to himself, and he could not remain without running the risk of witnessing a scene which would be not only exceedingly painful to him, but perfectly harrowing to Hugo. He had, however, concluded to submit to any unkind aspersions upon himself, in the hope that his presence and that of his daughter might, at least in some degree, protect the boy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Blanc and Mr. Burton both saluted him distantly, the latter eying him all the time. Mr. Blanc, meantime, with great severity of manner, thus addressed Hugo:</p>
               <p>"I see that you are still determined to idle away precious time in a manner entirely adverse to my wishes, and although this meeting is unexpected, it has happened very opportunely. I have just been making arrangements with Mr. Burton, which will relieve your preceptor (nodding his head in the direction of Grattan) of any further trouble on your account, and place you in a situation where you <emph>may</emph> become useful."</p>
               <p>Hugo's head drooped lower and lower as his father proceeded, and when he had finished he looked appealingly toward the place where Mr. Grattan and Mary were seated, but ventured not a word in reply. Mr. Grattan feeling it to be his duty, not only on his own account, but in behalf of the boy, to reply to Mr. Blanc's remarks, arose to his feet, and coming forward bowed in a gentlemanly manner to the other, and said to him:</p>
               <p>"Mr. Blanc, as your allusion to your son's preceptor was, I suppose, intended for me, you will permit me to explain our connection, particularly as your manner seems to indicate that you suspect me of having encouraged your son in this pursuit, contrary to your wishes."</p>
               <p>"That is precisely what I have thought," said Mr. Blanc, stiffly, "and I shall be pleased to be undeceived."</p>
               <p>"Well, then," Mr. Grattan continued, "I have only to assure you that I learned from your son's own lips to-day, for the first time, that you were not reconciled to his present employments, and, perhaps, had other views for him."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, father," said Hugo, interrupting him, "Mr. Grattan is not to blame; on the contrary, when I told him of your feelings, he candidly advised me to discontinue my practice in drawing."</p>
               <p>"It would seem very strange, then," his father replied, "if neither my wishes nor the advice of your friend, who speaks no doubt from <emph>experience,</emph> could have sufficient weight to induce obedience."</p>
               <p>"What can I do," said Hugo, looking up despairingly, "to satisfy you?"</p>
               <p>"That is what I was coming at," his father continued; "I have just concluded an arrangement with Mr. Burton which will make it necessary for you to turn your thoughts into a<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6567-00000010"/> more practical channel. You are to enter his store on Monday morning; and you, sir," he said, turning to Mr. Grattan, "being witness to this arrangement, I trust will encourage him no further."</p>
               <p>"I shall certainly do nothing to make your son disobedient," Mr. Grattan answered; "but I may be allowed to question respectfully the wisdom of your plan."</p>
               <p>"We shall not stop to argue that question," the other replied, haughtily. "In the mean time, Hugo, you can return home, and let this be the last of this nonsense. I am going a short distance farther, and when I get home will make you acquainted with the particulars of this arrangement."</p>
               <p>This was all uttered with the air of one who felt that here, at least, his will was law; and at its conclusion the two gentlemen continued their walk, while the little party which we have first introduced to our reader sadly pursued their way homeward; nor was the silence broken the whole way, except by Mr. Grattan and Mary, who walked on in advance, and conversed in low voices. Hugo and his sister followed after, the former completely crushed and broken, voiceless and hopeless, and she, knowing her brother's ardent love of the profession he had chosen, feeling utterly unable to give him comfort or hope.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
               <head type="sub">COMMENCEMENT OF "PRACTICAL LIFE."</head>
               <p>A WEARY Sunday had been passed in melancholy listlessness; Mr. Blanc's plan had been revealed to Hugo; Monday morning had dawned bright and beautiful, inviting him with many smiles to the woods and fields, as was his wont, but darkness had settled upon his heart, and the beauties in nature were no more for him. The family breakfast had been dispatched, after a solemn grace from the father, in perfect silence, and eight o'clock found the two on the road to the village, where Hugo was to be placed at the desk and counter of Mr. Burton, an apprentice to the mercantile business. Despair was written in every lineament of the poor boy's face, and he walked forward mechanically, without uttering a word, his thoughts only intent upon the beautiful world so unfeelingly shut out to him, and the dark and gloomy path upon which he was so soon to enter. Mr. Blanc felt uncomfortable at the boy's changed appearance, and many times tried to rally him, by picturing to him the advantages of the situation which he had secured for him, and trying to impress upon his mind the utter worthlessness of those tastes and impulses which alone animated him. He dwelt at length upon the importance of contracting business habits early in life, and presented sad pictures to his eye of the fate of those who, insensible or indifferent to the realities of life, wasted their best years in the acquirement of skill and knowledge in art, literature, and science, only to live lives of deprivation and disappointment, and end their career in hopeless poverty. In<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6567-00000011"/> illustration of this fact, he instanced his best and dearest friend, Mr. Grattan, giving him a history of his struggles and trials, and alluding to his present position as that of a pauper, dependent alone upon the commissions of sympathizing friends, who, in <emph>charity,</emph> gave him a bare pittance occasionally (for works which had cost him months of labor and study), to keep himself and family from starvation. He then contrasted this with a similar review of the past history and present-position of Mr. Burton, who though no further advanced in life than the other, had risen from an ignorant, uncouth errand-boy in one of the mercantile establishments of the village, to a position of wealth, and, of course, power. He labored earnestly to impress upon his son a clear idea of the necessity of a knowledge of the practical affairs of life, and argued strongly against the folly of wasting precious time upon pursuits out of which nothing was to be made. He presented many pictures to him similar to the above, for the purpose of convincing him that to live comfortably one must necessarily be rich, and that to be rich, the employment of one's entire energies in pursuits connected with the daily wants of the human family was indispensable. "The works of the artist," he said, "were luxuries which could be dispensed with, and none were <emph>obliged</emph> to purchase—but food, clothing, and other <emph>necessaries</emph> of life they <emph>must</emph> and would have. Hence the merchant, the mechanic, the farmer are seldom found living in want; while the artist, the literary man, the genius as you call him, has always been, and is ever destined either to starve or live upon charity."</p>
               <p>All this fell with little weight upon Hugo's ear, who, although he made no reply, neither ventured any objections to his father's arguments, was still not convinced; and he kept asking himself if it were possible that the Almighty had endowed certain of his creatures with marked tastes overriding all other feelings or wishes, without the expectation that they would be exercised, and exert a good influence upon man. Young as he was, this idea would constantly recur to him as they walked along, and he could not help thinking, notwithstanding standing his father's arguments, that the world was more to blame for not properly rewarding genius, than those who possessed this attribute were for exercising it, and he felt hopeful that the time was not distant, when a better state of things would exist. Then his heart would grow sad again, when he thought how little hope there was for <emph>him,</emph> and how utterly all his bright fancies were to be crushed, through the miserable trickeries and petty meannesses of the new vocation which his father recommended so strongly.</p>
               <p>The conversation which had thus far been carried on between the two, as well as the mental speculations and hopes of the father, and the dreadful fears and fancies of Hugo in anticipation of his new life, were cut off by their arrival at the door which gave entrance to the establishment of Mr. Burton, whose name in large letters was displayed in the most attractive manner in hues of brown and gold upon its front, so that none need mistake the place "where greater bargains were to be had than at any other similar establishment in the village."</p>
               <p>Hugo felt his heart sink within him as they passed through the store and stood upon the threshold of the little dingy, smoke-begrimed counting-room. Here sat the fat, sleek, and comfortable Mr. Burton, mounted upon a high stool, superintending the movements of a thin, cadaverous, mummy-like little book-keeper, who looked as if his soul had long since left the dried-up carcass that had enshrined it.</p>
               <p>When he arrived here, and looked upon this scene, no criminal about to be plunged into a dungeon and shut out from God's air and sunshine forever, could have felt more hopelessly wretched.</p>
               <p>"John Roach," said the little fat man, bending earnestly over a large day-book, and not noticing the new arrival, "page two hundred and one. Three pounds of coffee, fifty-six cents; four yards muslin, fifty cents; one pound tobacco, twelve and a half cents:" At this item he turned to the mummy and said: "Write that thirteen cents, Lankton. It will be quite as well to have the half cent in our favor as his.<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6567-00000012"/> Indeed, this is a good rule to adopt, <emph>always.</emph> And whenever a fraction occurs in any amount—as thirty-seven and a half, eighteen and three fourths—write it thirty-eight, nineteen. Well, go on to the next, James Moody, page two hundred." At this moment a slight cough from Mr. Blanc arrested his attention, and turning around, his eye fell upon our hero and his father. Closing his book, he got down from his stool, came forward, and shook hands with Mr. Blanc in the most bland and affable manner, and turning to Hugo, patted him familiarly on the head and said:</p>
               <p>"Glad to see you, my boy; you shall enter upon your duties at once; the sooner you get initiated the better. Mr. Blanc, my 'young man,' Mr. Lankton; Hugo—Lankton; he will be your fellow-clerk, and give you any aid you require."</p>
               <p>"Selling goods will pay better than painting pictures, as you will find. You only want to get a little acquainted with the business, to like it—men always like it when they are filling their pockets. Eh! Mr. Blanc. We'll have you fixed directly, Master Hugo. Here, here is a place to hang your hat," leading him to a dark and dingy corner of the countingroom, and pointing to a peg in the wall. "Fine boy, Mr. Blanc—a little sad—but intelligent—good address, and will make himself popular, among my lady customers." Here he indulged in a faint effort at a laugh, and added: "I will make a man of him, sir, if he is what he ought to be, and makes good use of his advantages."</p>
               <p>The conclusion of this speech was uttered with the air of one who felt that the <emph>advantages</emph> he offered were of no mean importance, and although Mr. Blanc was a man of sense, with all his firm determination, the manner of the man (coupled with this disjointed lecture to Lankton before his presence was known) did not altogether please even him; but he reflected that Mr. Burton had a wide-spread reputation as a shrewd and careful business man, and he merely replied that "he hoped Hugo would please him, and secure a permanent employment."</p>
               <p>"Certainly, Mr. Blanc," Burton replied, "I hope so too, indeed deed I think so—unfortunate, however, that his mind has been warped by that lunatic Grattan. He will, when once he gets to love the business, however, soon get over that. Discipline! discipline, sir, will bring everything right."</p>
               <p>"Well, Mr. Burton, I will leave Hugo with you, and believe that he has made up his mind to exert himself to gratify me by close attention to his duties. He has ability enough to make you a good clerk, and I shall be grievously disappointed should he not do so." The latter part of this sentence was addressed very pointedly to his son, who still stood in the dingy corner where he had hung up his hat, with his back toward them, picking at his handkerchief, which he occasionally applied to his eyes.</p>
               <p>"Good-morning, Mr. Burton," Mr. Blanc continued; "good-morning, Hugo. I shall hope to hear a good account of you."</p>
               <p>"Good-morning, father," came with a choked utterance from the dingy corner; "I will try to please you." This was said, however, with an air which told plainly how much suffering this <emph>trying</emph> would cost him; but his father, too well pleased with his words, did not observe his manner, and departed, leaving him to enter upon his new duties without a particle of sympathy for feelings which he could not have understood.</p>
               <p>Hugo remained in the same position for some time after his father had left, and the thin clerk had turned around upon his stool, and was surveying him with a curious expression upon his dried-up features, while Mr. Burton cleared his throat to give utterance to certain introductory lessons which he wished to impart to him. But seeing that Hugo still did not move from his position, and appeared to be quite overcome by his feelings, he turned to Lankton and said:</p>
               <p>"Write down our marks for him—this will soon pass off;" and while the clerk busied himself as directed, Mr. Burton walked back and forth upon the floor, gradually approaching nearer and nearer to Hugo, until there were only a few feet intervening between them, when he paused, and looking inquiringly at him, asked:</p>
               <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6567-00000013"/>
               <p>"Are you dissatisfied with your prospects, Hugo, that you seem so unhappy?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, Mr. Burton, I suppose the situation is as good as any; but I am afraid I shall never make a good clerk."</p>
               <p>"Are you willing to try?"</p>
               <p>"I have promised to do that," he answered; "but I do not feel that I have any taste for it."</p>
               <p>"Very well, then, we will say as little about taste as possible; that savors too much of Grattan, and the sooner you forget the folly he has put into your head, the better it will be for you. You have never had any experience in selling goods, I take it?"</p>
               <p>"None in the world," Hugo answered.</p>
               <p>"Very well, then," Mr. Burton went on; "I shall, before going further, give you some idea of <emph>our</emph> method of doing business. We have a certain class of regular customers who trade <emph>always</emph> with <emph>us,</emph> and who never buy elsewhere. These we furnish with whatever they want, if it is to be found in the village, and you are never to put them to the inconvenience of going elsewhere. You understand me?"</p>
               <p>"I think I do; I am to go out and purchase for them articles which you have not here?"</p>
               <p>"Exactly so! you are right. Now, these persons are our wealthiest citizens—some in town, and some in the country—and we charge them only fifteen per cent. profit. Do you understand that?"</p>
               <p>"I think not," Hugo answered, looking up timidly.</p>
               <p>"I suspected as much. Well, a per-cent. profit is an allowance upon the original cost and transportation of the goods. To make it plain to you, a piece of goods which cost us one dollar, including carriage, we should put to <emph>this</emph> class of customers at one dollar and fifteen cents. Do you see?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes!" Hugo replied, eying the little man curiously, "I understand now."</p>
               <p>"Very good! Our town customers of this class are such families as the Hon. Cadmus Wheedler, member of Congress; Peter Knab, Esq.; Dr. Draper, your father, and others that you will get acquainted with in time, as well in town as country. Very good; now then, there is another class of customers who have no <emph>regular</emph> place of doing business, but who go about hunting up <emph>bargains</emph>—generally poor people—great 'bores,' and great Jews—they will hang for the last cent—and as some compensation for the trouble they give us, <emph>we have no fixed rule in regard to them.</emph> Do you understand what I mean?"</p>
               <p>Hugo looked at him fixedly for a moment, his eye expressive of a surprise and indignation which he dared not put into words, and answered:</p>
               <p>"Not entirely, I think."</p>
               <p>Mr. Burton was considerably disconcerted at his manner, but went on explaining with great volubility and earnestness, that these persons he alluded to were the pests of a merchant's life—poor people, who had but little to buy with, and consequently expected to get goods for nothing. "We <emph>can't</emph> have any <emph>fixed</emph> per-centage with such people," he proceeded, with the air of an injured party, "they are such Jews; and the only way we can manage them, is to fix the price of any article they want <emph>much above</emph> our usual price, and catch them," he added, with a laugh, "at any point between, where <emph>they bite;</emph> it's the only way to manage them. Don't you see?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," Hugo answered, with a flashing eye and a burning cheek, which the other did not observe. "Yes, sir, I <emph>see;</emph>" and he added, mentally, "I must steal from the poor what is lost on the rich customers. Oh, father, is this what you call practical life?"</p>
               <p>"Well, we understand each other, then. Now come here," Mr. Burton continued, leading the way to the desk where Lankton sat, and picking up the bit of paper upon which he had scribbled some mysterious characters; "here are our cost and price marks; the first, you see, is made up of arbitrary characters, to represent the figures from one to ten, and can be used in any combination, to express any amount. The other is made up of the words, 'O man, be just,' which sentence contains just ten letters. Under these you can arrange<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6567-00000014"/> the figures, and soon learn how to tell the cost and selling price of every article in the concern. Now, take this, and go into the store and examine the marks upon the goods, and learn to read the prices from them readily, so that you will not have constant occasion to ask some one else, when we are busy. This will be your employment for to-day."</p>
               <p>Hugo mechanically obeyed, and soon found himself wandering about behind the counter, pulling out little bits of paper here and there, which were attached to rolls of goods of various kinds, and trying, through his tears, to unravel this first great mystery in his new vocation, in which he was aided by a spruce young man, another <foreign xml:lang="FRA">attaché</foreign> of the establishment, who followed after, to enlighten him when he found any difficulty. Scalding tears would every few moments force themselves to his eyes, and he would frequently pause to wipe them away before proceeding (an operation which seemed to afford great amusement to the young man who attended him); then starting on again, with a new effort to control himself, he would proceed pretty well a little way, until the thought of his past life of high and pure enjoyment, as compared with the new life before him, would again fill his eyes with tears, and render all marks and signs unintelligible. Pausing, at length, near the end of the counter, he leaned his head upon a pile of muslins, and wept without any effort at concealment, while his companion, a coarse-feeling, brutish, embryo practical man, waggishly resting his elbows upon the counter, indulged in various grimaces with his fellow-clerk, Lankton, who was standing in the counting-room door, looking on with evident pleasure, and enjoying to the full this pantomime, at the expense of the new clerk.</p>
               <p>Thus was a systematic course adopted to drive from the boy's heart feelings and aspirations not of this world, and convert him into a living machine to coin money. We shall see how the plan succeeds.</p>

               <head type="sub">MYSTERIES OF MERCANTILE INIQUITY—TRIALS AND TEMPTATIONS OF THE NEOPHYTE CLERK.</head>
               <p>HUGO'S initiation at Mr. Burton's was proceeding rapidly, and certain dread anticipations and apprehensions—imaginary pictures of this new field of labor and development ("Heaven save the mark!"), which had tortured his mind from the want of actual experience—were being realized. That there was <emph>something</emph> about it which would conflict seriously with his tastes, was a thought which had long previously been impressed upon his mind. He is now, under the eye of Mr. Burton and his two satellites, fast learning, by bitter experience, the truth of what had only hitherto been whispered to his soul by unseen agencies—whether of spirit or matter, we leave for the wise to determine. It matters not, for our purpose, whether from the one or the other; it suffices us to know, not being philosophers or theologians, that the facts in the particular case before us existed as indicated. Hugo Blanc is not the first, nor is he to be the last, martyr to false opinions of what is best for man's highest development; for so long as a large proportion of any people practice upon the idea that all men are made alike, and can, by the force of drilling, be made equally successful in <emph>any</emph> pursuit their own or their friends' fancies may select for them, just so long will there be Hugo Blancs. There are full-grown men and half-grown boys stalking through life, broken in spirit, deadened in sensibility, soured with themselves and the whole human family—sad examples of wasted time and misplaced energies<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6567-00000015"/> —wrecks upon life's ocean, which, like wrecks upon a real ocean, strike the beholder with sorrow and gloom. Many a fine lawyer has been wrecked at the plowshare; many a fine farmer has stranded among calicoes, linen, and damask; many an eminent embryo physician has wasted all his mental and physical powers in vain efforts to become a mechanic; and many a good mechanic is now hurrying his multitudes to early graves as a physician. Many an embryo banker or tradesman labors through prosy sermons, and launches from the pulpit his weekly and weakly evidences of his unfitness for the position he occupies, and many an embryo clergyman, full of charity and good-will to men, sickens over his cent. percent. in the ill-suited and ill-fitting character of a banker. Four fifths of the human family are wrecks; and let us not wonder that we have so many Blancs and Burtons, who, perhaps, started in life full of those attributes that would have done honor to any position; but by the irresistible power of the winds and waves of a fictitious life, have wrecked their fine impulses upon the shoals and hidden rocks of a miserably mistaken public opinion.</p>
               <p>Could politicians be induced to act honestly, or divines preach conscientiously, we might yet hope. But there is no hope while both think so much of themselves, and so little for the starving thousands who need nurture for the body as well as the soul. The artist may starve in his garret, the writer die neglected and almost unnoticed, the musician—reduced to the intangibility of a zephyr—may float out of life into eternity upon some of his own sweet strains, but the politician will suggest no means for the encouragement of literature or the arts, because he proposes to use all the treasury pap for himself and his own bantlings. The worthy moral reformer is so overcome with his labors in establishing windy theories (not possible to be practiced), collecting charities, and arousing sympathies for Negroes, Hindoos, Chinese, and other benighted and down-trodden people, that he forgets that there is a tangible humanity that can act, feel, and suffer <emph>at home.</emph> The one is a dishonest knave, a creature, and perhaps haps a necessity, of the times; and the other, a kind of drag upon all human progress, who hangs with the tenacity of a "leech" to his old musty tenets, and tries to cram them down the throat of a driving world, which is fast leaving him and his theoretical nonsense in the rear. He walks in "purple and fine linen," and preaches humility. He hammers velvet-covered pulpits and gilded Bibles and prayer-books, and preaches charity. He thunders anathemas upon all who disagree with him, and preaches "good-will to men."</p>
               <p>Hugo Blanc is started upon his voyage of life, driven by the forces above alluded to; and sad days and weary weeks have merged into months, which to him seem like weeks, months, and years; and yet, from the midst of the gloom which surrounds him, his soul still looks sorrowfully out upon the picture-world, where <emph>God intended</emph> him to walk and live, to worship and be happy. The trials he had gone through during this interval will be readily understood by any refined, honorable person who places himself, in <emph>imagination</emph> even, behind the counter in a retail establishment conducted upon the plan of that of Mr. Burton. There are many such in the country; and one can well conceive what would be the effect upon such a nature, of the petty cheateries and dishonest representations to ignorant customers, which are of every-day occurrence. Hugo had been long since filled with disgust for all these <emph>necessary</emph> qualifications to success; but this disgust was destined to be gradually converted into contempt for those with whom he was associated, and detestation of an employment which developed nothing that was manly; but, on the contrary, with few exceptions, converts all those engaged in it into contemptible cheats, and leads them to look upon all men as lawful prey—throwing out tempting attractions to those who desire to purchase, and stopping at no obstacle to effect a sale—heaping lie upon lie until the aggregate would send fifty souls to perdition, to wheedle ignorance out of a few hard-earned coppers; and, when the day's business is over, retiring to some little dungeon-like counting-room, to laugh over these soul-degrading transactions!</p>
               <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6567-00000016"/>
               <p>To such a scene as this we shall now introduce you, at the close of business on Saturday evening, in Mr. Burton's dingiest of dingy counting-rooms.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burton himself is seated at the desk, pen in hand, making entries in his cash-book, and closing up the business of the week; while the three clerks, Lankton, Smith, and Hugo, are seated near the center of the room, the two former indulging in smothered fits of laughter at tales of rascality which had been practiced during the past week, and Hugo sitting by, a quiet but indignant listener. Lankton, with his cat-like visage, and hungry, cadaverous look, seemed particularly happy in this kind of retrospection, and detailed with great fluency the many bargains he had made, and chuckled over the victims he had fleeced—partly, no doubt, to annoy Hugo, whose manner said plainly enough that the subject, as well as the individuals discussing it, were anything but agreeable to him. That kind of pleasure twinkled in the eyes of Lankton which is often to be seen in those who, feeling their own inferiority, take a villainous delight in saying or doing anything to annoy those who are better and purer than themselves, whenever chance may bring them in contact. And perfectly aware of Hugo's unsullied honesty and integrity, he fixed his little piercing eyes upon him, and seemed to find exquisite pleasure in the indignation which gathered in his countenance as he proceeded in his catalogue of petty villainies. In concluding his budget of achievements for the past week, he burst into a loud laugh, and exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"That lick at the old woman, Smithy, with her 'fady calico,' as she called it, was the richest of all. Lord! what a long face she had when she brought it back, and how pious and innocent I was!"</p>
               <p>"Well, Lankey," said Smith, "you did do the old thing brown; but I think you ought to have taken the calico back when she returned it so badly faded, particularly as you told her it <emph>wouldn't</emph> fade."</p>
               <p>"I didn't tell her it wouldn't fade," Lankton replied. "She asked me if it would wash, and I told her I would warrant it to <emph>wash.</emph> She took two dresses of it, and as the color all faded out in washing it, she came here yesterday expecting me to refund the money or give her better goods in exchange."</p>
               <p>"You ought to have done it," Smith replied, with a mock air of sympathy. "It was a shame to deceive the old woman that way."</p>
               <p>"I didn't deceive her at all, Smith; she deceived herself. To be sure, it looks a <emph>little</emph> bad, for the old lady earns her money by the hardest labor; but she is old enough to have her 'eye teeth cut,' and ought to have known what she was about."</p>
               <p>"I pity the old thing, notwithstanding, Lankey," Smith returned, with solemn mockery, "and you ought to be ashamed to take such an advantage of her ignorance."</p>
               <p>"You are a pretty chap to preach," the other returned, with a quizzical look, first over one shoulder at Mr. Burton, and then over the other at Smith. "How is it about that 'old Cognac brandy' you sold to Kruck?"</p>
               <p>At this question Smith laughed outright, and Lankton turned to Hugo, and told him that Smith had converted a barrel of whisky—"very ordinary whisky at that"—into prime old brandy, and sold it to Kruck for about four or five prices.</p>
               <p>"Give us the particulars, Smithey," he said, addressing Smith; "how was it?"</p>
               <p>"Oh!" Smith began, "it was rich, I tell you. Old Kruck, you know, always trades with me, because he thinks I give him better bargains than any one about the concern. Well, last Thursday morning he came lumbering into the store with his old drab 'wamus' and linsey breeches on, and walks up to me and says: 'Well, Schmidt, how is it about pranty today?'</p>
               <p>"'What about it, Kruck?' I asked him.</p>
               <p>"'Have you got any good pranty py te parrel?' says Kruck.</p>
               <p>"'How long you goin' to be in town, Kruck?' says I.</p>
               <p>"'Oh, not longer as about four o'glock, I dinks,' says he.</p>
               <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6567-00000017"/>
               <p>"'Well, Kruck,' says I—(you see, Lankey, I wanted to get time)—'we've got some prime old Cognac down at the warehouse, and if you'll come in again about two o'clock, I'll have some up.'</p>
               <p>"'How much ze brice?' says Kruck.</p>
               <p>"'Oh, I'll make it low, Kruck, seein' it's you,' says I; 'we always sell lower to dealers in the article.'</p>
               <p>"'How much?' says Kruck, without moving.</p>
               <p>"'Well,' says I, 'Kruck, we can't put that brandy much less than two dollars a gallon; it cost us a dollar and sixty-two cents in New York.'"</p>
               <p>"Lord, what a lie!" interposed Lankey.</p>
               <p>"Never you mind, Lankey; I caught him anyhow, to a pretty good tune," Smith went on. "'But,' says I, 'Kruck, you come in about two o'clock, and I will let you prove it for yourself.' Well, away he went, promising to come back at the time appointed, and I pitched in to fix up the 'pranty' 'accor'n' to contract. I took an old Eastern cask, with the New York marks upon it, and filled it about three quarters full of whisky and rain-water. These I shook up well to make them mix, and then I filled the balance of the barrel full of 'real good brandy,' closed up the bung-hole, turned down the tin and nailed it fast—rubbed a little mud over it, so't he wouldn't see where I'd been pounding, and rolled it to one side among a lot of other barrels, to wait until Kruck came back. I managed so well that the cask looked as if it had never been opened since it left New York. Well, about two o'clock Kruck comes back, and I pretended to be very busy. I didn't want to seem anxious.</p>
               <p>"'Is ter pranty come?' says Kruck, calling to me as I was busy weighing out some tea for an old lady; 'is ter pranly come, Schmidt?'</p>
               <p>"'I don't know, Kruck,' says I; 'it ought to be here: you just sit down, and I'll see Sam directly.' Well, Krack sat down, and I went on fivin' the old woman out; and when I'd done, I walked 'kind a' carelessly out into the back store, and told Sam to roll the cask to the back door, and when he saw me coming in with Kruck, just be rolling it in."</p>
               <p>Here Lankton and Smith joined in a hearty laugh before the latter proceeded. "Well, having this all fixed, I went back to Kruck, and told him Sam was just rolling in the cask, and we walked out together into the back store. Sam is a great darkey," Smith continued, laughing. "As soon as we appeared, he commenced pushing and grunting at the cask, and rolled it to the middle of the floor, when he straightened himself up, and commenced cursing the drayman for throwing it down in the mud. At first I didn't know what the nigger meant, but when I got a little nearer, sure enough one end of the cask was covered with dirt, and looked exactly as if it had been 'ended off' into the mud outside the door. Kruck was completely 'took in,' and the rest of the job was easy. I got a hatchet and proof-bottle, knocked the tin off the bung again, opened it, and dipped up a bottle of as <emph>fine-looking</emph> brandy as ever you saw, and handed it to Kruck."</p>
               <p>"Lord! Lord!" Lankey exclaimed again, "what deception!" And rolling his eyes at Hugo, he added, "You'll be ruined here."</p>
               <p>"All right," Smith returned, winking at his companion, "but let's finish Kruck. Well, he first took up the proof-bottle, and held it to the light, and looked at it a long time, then tasted it, and looked again. 'She's a little pit riley,' says he. 'Oh,' says Sam, breaking in here, 'that's jolting over the road, and the pitch the drayman gave it.' 'Yes,' says I, 'that's it, Kruck; you know the best liquor <emph>looks</emph> a little riley for a while after it's been moved.'</p>
               <p>"'Sure,' says Kruck, 'dat's so, dat's so—'sis putty goot pranty,' and he smacked his lips. 'Now, Schmidt, put it low—I likes 'is putty well for 'sheep pranty,' put I dinks 'tswa dollar' a little too pig brice.'</p>
               <p>"'Well,' says I, 'Kruck, as it's you, if you want the cask just as it is, you can have it for a dollar and three quarters, but 'blame me' if we make anything on it at that, and I wouldn't sell it to any other man for that price.' This was<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6567-00000018"/> a clincher; Kruck took the 'pranty,' and paid me the cash for it;" and he added, looking at Lankey and laughing immoderately, "he ha'nt brought it back 'all faded out.'"</p>
               <p>"There now!" Lankton exclaimed, turning to Hugo with a mock look of indignation, "what do you think of that? What do you think of that, for an <emph>honest</emph> young man?"</p>
               <p>"I think," said Hugo, "that it was very small business, to say the least of it."</p>
               <p>"Would be, for pious-raised young men like you," Smith replied, tartly; "but from poor, low devils like us, nothing better could be expected."</p>
               <p>"I won't dispute that question with you," said Hugo, in reply; "but I can say with certainty, that I would not be guilty of such a piece of deception, much less acknowledge it."</p>
               <p>"You will make a brave clerk," said Smith, laughing scornfully. "You had much better have remained at home, where you would have had good nursing, than venture among business men, if your conscience is so tender."</p>
               <p>The fire of aroused passion burned for a moment in Hugo's eye, and he was on the point of retorting angrily, when Lankton interfered, and with a grin full of maliciousness, said—"Oh, Smith, you are too hard upon him; I think the fact of his selling seven yards of silk to Mrs. Brown for eight, ought to entitle him to great credit for skill in the science of '<emph>thumbing.</emph>' He'll make a good clerk yet," he continued, with a chuckling, hand-saw sort of a laugh, in which Smith joined heartily.</p>
               <p>This was too much for Hugo—rising to his feet with flashing eyes and clenched fist, he said to Lankton, "You know that what you say is not true, for you are well aware that I was too much confused at the time, it being the first goods I ever measured in my life, to know well what I was about, and a mistake of that kind could not be perverted in such a manner by any <emph>honest person.</emph>" Particular stress was laid upon the last words, and a fierceness exhibited in his manner which evidently surprised both his companions; and blows might have been the consequence, had not Mr. Burton interfered in time to prevent.</p>
               <p>He had been <emph>apparently</emph> busy during this colloquy, but a close observer might have seen that not a word of the conversation just narrated escaped him. A smile of satisfaction had lighted up his face up to the point where Hugo's honest, manly reply to the question of Lankton had excited Smith's anger, when the smile gave place to an expression which said as plain as <emph>words</emph> could have said it, "This boy will never make a business man; he will not suit <emph>me.</emph>" Still he continued an interested listener until he deemed it necessary to interfere to prevent an open quarrel, when he turned around, and, looking at Hugo and Lankton, who stood eying each other fiercely, called out, "Lankton! Hugo! what is the meaning of all this? you forget where you are."</p>
               <p>"Hugo called me dishonest, sir," said Lankton, "and I never took that from any one."</p>
               <p>Mr. Burton turned sternly to Hugo, and said, "Young man, if you are seeking a discharge from my employment, a few more scenes like this will bring it about. I have no bullying here, I warn you now. Lankton and Smith have always got along smoothly together, and since you came here, several scenes of this kind have occurred; let this be the last of it."</p>
               <p>Hugo felt the injustice of this reproof, and attempted an explanation; but Mr. Burton, already fully aware where the fault was, chose rather not to seem to know anything about it, and for fear that he might be compelled to reprove the others, whose invaluable services he could not deprive himself of, stopped him at once by saying, "No explanations are necessary, sir; I have no bullying here, whatever the provocation, and will send you home to your father, sir, the first time such a scene occurs in my establishment again."</p>
               <p>Hugo's naturally keen perceptions enabled him to see through the flimsy vail behind which Mr. Burton screened himself, and without attempting to explain any further, he walked sullenly into the store, which was now dark, and threw himself upon his little cot without undressing, and gave himself up to the bitter reflections upon his situation which<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6567-00000019"/> all these mortifying circumstances called forth. He felt sure that Mr. Burton had heard the conversation between himself and the other two, and was satisfied that he was better pleased with their sly, tricky talent than he was with his straightforward honesty, and that in order to prevent too open an exposure of his feelings he had refused to permit him to explain.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burton, Lankton, and Smith remained in the counting-room long after Hugo had gone to sleep, and then separated for the night; Mr. Burton going to his house, which stood upon the outskirts of the village, and Lankton and Smith each retiring to their separate cots, which stood at opposite sides of the counting-room. Once in bed and the light extinguished, Lankton said to Smith, scarcely above a whisper, "I wonder if Hugo's awake?"</p>
               <p>"No!" said Smith, "he's been asleep this long time."</p>
               <p>"Well," continued Lankton, in the same tone, "don't you think the old cove managed that matter ingeniously? Would'nt let Hugo explain—dev'lish indifferent about the merits of the quarrel—didn't want to know anything about it. I saw him smile complacently at our ingenious method of selling 'fady calico,' and he could hardly hold in at your story about old Kruck; perhaps I saw him laugh to himself, and perhaps I didn't—but I just did." At this facetious termination he laughed until the little cot shook under him. As soon as he could get his breath he asked: "What do you think, Smithey?"</p>
               <p>"I think," said the other, "that the old codger fully appreciates our wonderful merits and applauds our ingenuity. He took the young man down some, didn't he?"</p>
               <p>"He did that; Lord, how grum he looked when he promenaded into the store to bunk! I don't think old Burty will be a bit sorry if we take a little of the starch out of him, and, for my part, I mean to exert myself to give him a happy time."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps," said Smith, laughing, "I don't make him clean out the cellar after this, and perhaps he won't have to do his full share of sweeping and dusting."</p>
               <p>"Yes, and <emph>perhaps</emph> old Burty won't make him 'trot up;' I know <emph>him</emph> like a book—I have lived with him a great many years, and if he don't contrive to get rid of this chap before his year is up, I loose my guess. He's entirely too honest for him—and, Lord, what long prayers Burty will say to-morrow in church!—<emph>aint</emph> it rich?"</p>
               <p>"Well, it is; but I'll tell you what it is, Lankey, I have been thinking about it, and I don't half like the way this little devil talked to me, nor the way he 'spunked up' to you—what can we do to take him down?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, we'll 'pile the agony on' the young man in the way of extra jobs; make him carry parcels home, and 'render himself generally useful;' and if he gets obstreperous, we'll complain to old Burty, and he'll make him feel comfortable; no doubt he'll take the spunk out of him! Oh! Smith," he added, with one of his peculiarly grating chuckles, "you may bet your life I'll devote myself to him for the 'balance of his term,' and if I don't give him a good time, then I'm mistaken, that's all."</p>
               <p>"I never liked him since he came into the store, Lankey, that's a fact. He's a dev'lish little aristocrat, and thinks he's got better blood in him than we have, and he cants so much about <emph>honesty,</emph> it bores me."</p>
               <p>"Yes, Smith, and it bores old Burty, too, although he likes to make people think he's so awful pious. It does me good to watch him. He'll come into the store Monday morning and he'll say to me, 'George, did you go to church yesterday?' 'Yes, sir,' I tell him. 'Ah, I'm glad of that,' he'll say; 'it's an excellent way to get character;' and then he'll go on with a long sermon about morality and good conduct, and in the next breath, if it's a little dull, tell me to put out a bill—'selling off at cost,' to 'gull-trap' people into buying goods that they don't want. He'll have a 'good time' getting Hugo into this sort of thing; he thought it was a horrible thing, the other day, to add the interest to the principal on Billy Tudor's note, that he wanted to have renewed."</p>
               <p>"Oh, fudge!" said Smith, half asleep; "he's too milk-and-water<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6567-00000020"/> water to sell goods—and Burty would be glad now to be rid of him, I know."</p>
               <p>"Well, let's go to sleep, Smithey, it's late," Lankton replied; "we'll 'tend to his case <emph>regularly</emph> after this."</p>
               <p>Silence followed this remark, and Smith lay quietly listening to the cricket that chirruped from the corner of the room, and tried to compose himself to sleep; while Lankton, following the dictates of a vindictive nature, was busying his brain with some plan to revenge himself upon Hugo.</p>
               <p>Sleep on, Hugo, and in your sleep renew, in dreams, those delightful sketching rambles with your dear friend which are denied to your waking. Sleep on! no grinding policy can control your dreams, and while stretched upon your little cot, inhaling the pent-up gases of your worse than prison, you may enjoy <emph>in dreams</emph> God's free air and sunshine again. And while grim revenge sits upon the pillow of your fellow-clerks, and drives sleep from their eyelids, and Mammon guards the slumbers of your "pious" employer, you may wander again, with rapid steps and light heart, through your favorite haunts, and revel in those beauties which delight you so much. Dream on—dream of love—dream of purity—dream of honesty—of justice—of faith between man and man—of all that you could wish or hope—to-morrow you will awake again to meet stern realities.</p>

               <head type="sub">ANTICIPATIONS DISAPPOINTED—PIOUS PLANS AND MEDITATIONS—HOW TO MAKE CONDITIONS UNCOMFORTABLE—MR. BURTON ALMOST CATCHES A TARTAR.</head>
               <p>ANOTHER Sunday morning dawned, bright and beautiful, giving promise of a lovely day; and as it had been the custom of Hugo to spend his Sundays at home, he had risen early and dressed himself with care, and as he stooped to black his boots in the counting-room, he whistled merrily or occasionally sang snatches of familiar songs, so light was his heart in anticipation of this day's emancipation from discipline, drudgery, and confinement. As Lankton and Smith had already dressed with unusual pains, and gone out, the happy current of his thoughts was not disturbed by their presence; and as he whistled or sung, his spirits were as buoyant and happy for the time as they had ever been in his happiest hours. He was already, in imagination, wandering delightedly through the forest, with Mary and Louise for his companions, on their way to the lake shore or the mountain, and his brain was full of what would be said and done during the day. He fancied Mary sitting beside him, and Louise bending over his shoulder while he transferred to paper some scene which either or both had admired, and he felt that here he should find true sympathy and earnest affection, and that he could, if he chose, run wild with delight, and meet with no reproof.</p>
               <p>It is by no means certain that he did not think, as he gave the finishing touch to his boots, washed his hands, and re-adjusted<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC6567-00000021"/> justed his cravat before the dirty piece of looking-glass—it is by no means certain that he did not think quite as much of the effect all this pains about his personal appearance would have upon Mary Grattan, as he did of sketching or rambling along the lake shore, or beside the mountain torrent. Be this as it may, it is safe to conclude from what we already know of his character and tastes, that when he threw his overcoat upon his arm and started to the door, a kind of mental panorama of all these feelings was passing through his brain. Once at the door, however, the bright current of his thoughts, whatever they might be, received a sudden check, for as he opened it he met Mr. Burton, almost out of breath, as if he had arrived at the top of his speed. Hugo despised the little man on <emph>all</emph> occasions, but an unusual sense of disgust and dislike seized him now, for he felt sure that this early visit boded no good to him. Mr. Burton, with an exclamation something between a snarl and a grunt, asked—</p>
               <p>"Where are you going, this morning, Hugo? I see you have your overcoat upon your arm, as if you were bound on a journey."</p>
               <p>"I was merely going home to spend the day," Hugo replied, "and thought it best to take my overcoat along, for fear it might rain before I return."</p>
               <p>"I should <emph>prefer,</emph>" said Mr. Burton, "that you remain here to-day; Smith and Lankton have gone to the country to spend the day, and I consider it best to have some one about to keep watch of the store."</p>
               <p>"Are you going away, too, Mr. Burton?" Hugo asked, trying to suppress his anger and disappointment, and thinking that Mr. Burton, perhaps, would volunteer to do all the watching that was necessary, and not deprive him of his anticipated pleasure.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burton turned and looked at him with surprise, and answered that he was not <emph>going away,</emph> but that he wished to attend church, and always required at least <emph>one</emph> of his "young men" to be about the store on Sunday.</p>
               <p>"But," said Hugo, unwilling to give it up, "I have been accustomed to go home every Sunday since I came here, and we have all three been absent frequently before without any accident happening."</p>
               <p>"That is precisely what has brought me here so early this morning; I expected that you would 'be off,' as usual, and as I knew that Smith and Lankton were going to be absent to-day, they having <emph>asked my consent</emph> last night, I came down thus early to tell you that I desired you to remain. Breakfast will be ready in half an hour, and as we design going to church, you will not delay it."</p>
               <p>With these words, Mr. Burton turned upon his heel and walked up the street again, leaving Hugo upon the door-step, looking sullenly down upon the earth, and debating with himself whether he would not go home, in defiance of Mr. Burton, let the consequences be what they might. Mary Grattan and Louise had been in the store during the week, and they had planned a ramble over the mountain for this day, which, for a mere whim of Mr. Burton's, must be given up. He had promised, too, to make a sketch for Mary, and why should he be compelled to forego the only happiness he now ever enjoyed, simply because Mr. Burton had taken a whim into his head that on this particular day the store must be watched? Reasoning thus, he worked himself into quite an angry mood, and had slammed together and locked the doors, and was starting up the street, with teeth set and hands clinched, angry that his plans should be interfered with, and determined to go home, let the result be what it might, when suddenly he thought of his father, and the fear of his displeasure made him alter his determination. Since he had resolved to try to please him, and, if possible, smother his own inclinations, he decided to do nothing to give him offense, and he turned and walked dejectedly back to the store, and going into the counting-room, hung up his coat again, and sat down to give loose to his indignant and angry feelings by heaping invectives upon Mr. Burton. Satisfied that his refusal to let him go home was more for the purpose of aggravating him than because he felt any concern about the store<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6567-00000022"/> being left alone, he was angry that circumstances compelled him to submit. But he was determined to pass the day as agreeably as possible, and, before going to breakfast, he took out of his trunk his sketching material, and determined to devote the day to his favorite employment.</p>
               <p>When Hugo arrived at Mr. Burton's and entered the dining-room, the family were already assembled, and the pious head was reading from the Bible the accustomed chapter before the morning meal. He looked gravely at Hugo as he entered, and paused in his reading while he seated himself; then proceeded in a monotonous tone to the end of the chapter, which was followed by a heedless rehearsal of the family prayers, and they sat down to breakfast. At its conclusion, as Hugo was about leaving the room, Mr. Burton handed him a little volume, entitled "Christian Advice to Young Men," and remarked that he could not better employ his time—as he would be in the store most of the day—than to give it a careful perusal. Our hero took the book, while the slightest possible curl of contempt exhibited itself upon his lip, and without making any promises to read it, he withdrew.</p>
               <p>Hugo once out of hearing, Mrs. Burton remarked to her lord—</p>
               <p>"That is an impudent fellow, and you throw away your kindness upon him. You might as well have kept the book yourself as to have given it to him."</p>
               <p>"What makes you think so?" asked Mr. Burton.</p>
               <p>"Why, I know by the expression of his countenance when you gave it to him. He looked just as if he would have liked to throw it into your face, and I have no doubt, from the account you gave me of the temper he exhibited last night, he 'wouldn't stop' much to do even that."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I'm satisfied, Mr. Burton answered, "that he will never answer my purpose; I must get rid of him." After a short pause, as if to study the consequences of some suggestion he was about to make, he continued: "I have been thinking since last evening that it would be well to be much more rigid with him, and adopt some course that will either cure him of his free, wild notions, or force him to quit my employment of his own accord. I don't like to <emph>dismiss</emph> him, on his father's account; he is a good customer and an influential man, both in and out of the Church—and," he said, after another pause, "if we <emph>must</emph> separate, I would rather it would seem at least to be his own fault."</p>
               <p>This last sentence was uttered with a peculiar look at his wife, and at its conclusion he still continued to gaze at her with an expression which seemed to ask, "I wonder if she fully understands me?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Burton exhibited a puzzled expression, and fidgeted about in her chair, doubtful whether she understood him, and as a relief from her embarrassment, she ventured to remark, that it was a pity he took the boy at all.</p>
               <p>"Very true," said Mr. Burton, vexed at her obtuseness; "but we <emph>have</emph> him, and the next thing is to get him off my hands without offending his father, whose business is worth several hundred dollars a year to me."</p>
               <p>"Is he so <emph>very</emph> bad, Mr. Burton, that you have no hope of reforming him by discipline?" Mrs. Burton asked, still perplexed to understand the drift of her husband's remarks.</p>
               <p>"Oh, fudge!" Mr. Burton exclaimed; "no; not bad, nor dishonest, that I know of, but he hasn't been raised right. He has no more notion of a business transaction than a horse, and the poetical nonsense he has imbibed from that lazy Grattan has about spoiled him. I'm satisfied he can't be cured. Now, what I was going to say, is this"—here he paused again, not from any conscientious scruples, but as if in doubt how his wife would take what he was about to say—drawing his chair a little nearer to her, and taking her affectionately by the hand, he went on: "You know, <emph>my dear</emph> [Mr. Burton didn't often say my dear], that it is an easy matter for us to make him uncomfortable—make <emph>him</emph> dissatisfied," he added, seeing a rather surprised expression on her face.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I think I understand you, Mr. Burton."</p>
               <p>"I'm afraid not, my dear. You see I don't want to offend his father; that's the rub. Now, we can task him a little too<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6567-00000023"/> much, you know; make him run of errands—contrive to make his meals unsatisfactory," he said, with a gentle pressure of his wife's hand to impress this particular point. "This will be doing no wrong; on the contrary, we shall exhibit our respect and consideration for his father's feelings by pursuing <emph>this</emph> course to get rid of him, rather than come to an open rupture."</p>
               <p>"But won't such an occurrence prevent him from getting another situation, Mr. Burton?" his wife asked, doubtingly.</p>
               <p>"Oh, no! my dear, I have thought of all that; and when the time comes, I will give him letters of recommendation which will secure him a situation anywhere."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Burton, who was not a very shrewd woman, seemed satisfied with this last assurance, and gave her approval of the course he proposed.</p>
               <p>This point gained, Mr. Burton rubbed his hands together with satisfaction, and continued further to develop his plans.</p>
               <p>"What I would suggest is this: you place any little innocent annoyances in his way about the house that you can; I will manage matters at the store myself. I think he don't feel very well pleased at my refusal to let him go home to-day, and I intend to pursue the same course every Sunday. To say nothing of my own purposes, it will be preventing him from breaking the Sabbath, and in this view will be doing him a kindness. As a <emph>Christian,</emph> Mrs. Burton, I could do no less."</p>
               <p>"I think you are acting very right, my dear," Mrs. Burton replied, "and his father would be more gratified than angry, if he knew how much pains you are taking to save his feelings."</p>
               <p>"That's it! that's it! Mrs. Burton; I would not for the world give offense to Mr. Blanc; and as Hugo is entirely unsuited to my purpose, I think I take a wise plan to avoid mortifying explanations to his father, which must necessarily follow an open discharge from my service. I am acting as I should expect a Christian to act toward me, if I was in his position."</p>
               <p>"It's very kind of you, Mr. Burton, I'm sure," his wife responded, "and no one could find fault with you."</p>
               <p>"Well," he continued, as if he considered the matter perfectly understood between them, "there is the church bell, and we shall have to hurry, or we'll be too late," and rising and putting on his hat and gloves, he put on at the same time that solemn exterior which men of his class understand so well when and how to assume.</p>
               <p>During the conversation above narrated, Hugo had reached the store, entered the counting-room, threw "Christian Advice to Young Men" into the corner with an expression of disgust (not for the book, but for Mr. Burton), and stripping himself of his coat and cravat, and opening the shutter of the back window to admit light upon his work, was, at the time the church bell broke up the conference between Mr. Burton and his wife and hurried them off to their pious devotions, absorbed in mind and heart in the delineation of some brilliant idea, which to him came without effort. Little did he dream how much of vexation, care, and suffering that conversation would entail upon his future life. He could not have comprehended, much less believed, if it had been told him, to what despicable trickery a man in Mr. Burton's position could descend to accomplish that which should have been accomplished by straightforward manliness. But he had yet to learn that manliness and an absorbing greed for money were never found coupled together; and as he knew nothing of the plan settled upon to force him to quit his present employment, his brilliant fancies were not for hours disturbed by any thought of the present or future, and during this time he had finished a beautiful sketch, and sat looking at it with an unsatisfied air. It had not equaled his expectations, and now that it was done, it afforded him less of pleasure than pain to look at it—and the all-absorbing interest he had felt while it had been growing under his hand, now suddenly gave place to disgust for his work; and those unpleasant feelings which his present position called up returned again upon him.</p>
               <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6567-00000024"/>
               <p>He looked out of the window before him upon piles of empty boxes, barrels, and filth that cumbered the back yard, and the only thing which he could see in his whole range of vision to give him pleasure was a few square yards of cloudy sky, over the roofs of the adjoining houses, revealing occasionally, through slight openings, the blue vault above, into which he gazed, and wondered if angels made their homes there, and whether they wandered free through the immensity of space, and reveled in the ever-changing beauties spread out around them by the lavish hand of the Creator. He wondered if the purity of their enjoyment was ever marred by a knowledge of the trials and troubles of those yet chained to this life; and as he thought, he turned around and surveyed the miserable den in which he sat, with a shudder of disgust. Its blackened walls, and dirty, greasy furniture, the piles of day-books, ledgers, and blotters, with all the other necessary appurtenances of a business man's "holy of holies;" the intolerable odor which filled every crack and cranny, from ceiling to floor, and the thought that his best years must be spent in such an atmosphere, and all his better nature smothered or killed for such pleasure as could be gained here, made him feel that the path of life was bitter indeed, and "hedged about with thorns." He looked again at the blue sky, and his thoughts seemed to take a pleasanter direction, for a smile for a moment played around his mouth and gradually verged upon an open laugh. Full of some funny conceit, suggested, the guardian spirits of artists (if they have any) only know how, he caught up his pencil again, and commenced working with great rapidity, as if fearful that he should lose his "idea," whatever it might be. First, there grew upon the paper a <foreign xml:lang="LAT">fac-simile</foreign> of the front of Mr. Burton's store, with the large letters over the door; then a figure so strongly resembling him that there was no mistaking it, dressed half-grenadier fashion, with a huge musket on his shoulder and cartouch-box at his side, looking fiercely forward, promenading in front; two figures also, strongly resembling Lankton and Smith, were climbing into a gay buggy which stood at the curb, while Mr. Burton, with a large prayer-book under his arm, followed by his family, with solemn look, promenaded out of one side of the picture—no doubt to church. As the finishing touch was given to this, Hugo threw himself back and laughed immoderately; but the laugh hung upon his lip, and a crimson flush spread over his countenance, followed instantly by an ashy paleness. Mr. Burton's hand was upon the door, but a few feet from where he sat, and his voice demanded entrance. The sketches were hastily gathered from the desk and thrust into his trunk, the door unbarred and opened before he had time to collect himself, and Mr. Burton walked in, looking suspiciously around him, evidently having heard enough of Hugo's hurried movements to excite his curiosity as to what he had been about.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burton was a sharp man, and was fond of taking his young men by surprise, as the readiest as well as surest means of preventing mischief; and he eyed Hugo for some time, enjoying his embarrassment, and trying to read in his face what he had not yet been able to discover in any other way. Foiled here, he took a general survey of the room again; and while thus engaged, his eye fell upon a bit of paper lying upon the floor, which did not have the familiar look of foolscap or commercial post, and walking forward, he picked it up. Hugo, noticing the movement, saw the fatal caricature, which he had but a moment ago finished (and which he had dropped upon the floor in his haste), in Burton's hands, and hurried forward, with burning cheeks, to possess himself of it before he could see what it was. Mr. Burton put him away with his hand, and walking nearer the window, held it up to examine it, with a pleased expression that he was about to find some new cause of complaint against him. Hugo, finding no escape from the consequences of this discovery, hung his head in silence; while, as the drawing developed itself to the dull comprehension of his employer, his countenance flushed with anger and indignation, and turning to the mortified youth, said, "So, young man, you<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6567-00000025"/> still find leisure to devote to your refining pursuits, in spite of all that has been said to you upon the subject, either by myself or your father?"</p>
               <p>Hugo made no reply.</p>
               <p>"Your diversified talent quite surprises me," Burton continued, sarcastically; "and I shall take the first opportunity to acquaint your father with it. He will, no doubt, be quite delighted."</p>
               <p>"Please, Mr. Burton," Hugo said, at length, "it was but a mere whim, and never intended to be exhibited to any one. You can not certainly wish to excite my father's anger against me for such a trifle."</p>
               <p>"Trifle, indeed," said Mr. Burton; "it is no trifle that you employ so much time in this way, which should be used in gaining a knowledge of business. This, however, I could overlook; but this slur upon my religious professions," he continued, holding up the drawing, and pointing to the pious group on one side, "must be reproved."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Burton," Hugo returned, "I have only done this to pass the time while I was confined here to-day, and it has not interfered with my business in any way; I never intended that the drawing should be seen by any one, and you have no right to retain it—give it to me, and I will burn it up. I <emph>must</emph> have it."</p>
               <p>"Must!" said Mr. Burton, swelling up pompously—"must! Suppose I say No!"</p>
               <p>"Then," said Hugo, stepping to the grate and picking up a huge iron poker, "I shall take means to make you say Yes;" and placing himself decidedly and firmly between Mr. Burton and the door, he assumed an attitude which warned that gentleman that he was not only in earnest, but possessed of the resolution to carry out his threat.</p>
               <p>A most consummate coward, as all mean men are, the flashing eye and fierce manner of the boy did not at all please Mr. Burton. The poker was trembling in his hand, and he reasoned with himself: "I am alone here with the little pirate, and he might, in his present savage mood, kill me;" and as this was not a pleasant thing to contemplate for one even as piously prepared as himself for such an event, he thought best to conciliate Hugo now, and settle with him afterward in his own way.</p>
               <p>He accordingly reached the drawing to him with a bland smile, saying that he had not intended to keep it, but only wished to frighten him from a pursuit so adverse to his father's plans and wishes, and turn his attention more entirely to those duties which devolved upon him in his present position. Softened by the manner of Mr. Burton, and relieved from his apprehensions as to the use he would make of the drawing by its recovery, he stood with his head bent forward, a picture of penitence. His anger was converted into alarm at the consequences that might follow, should this second exhibition of passion, involving a violent attack upon his employer, reach his father's ear, with such embellishments as he knew Mr. Burton could and would give it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burton's eye was upon him during this self-communion, noting every change in his manner, and he saw fully what was passing through his mind, and was willing to let the youth's fears produce their own effect. Satisfied with his present advantage, not wishing to give him any further cause for anger (and, to tell the truth, anxious to escape from the consequences of a second ebullition), Mr. Burton hoped that he would try to do better in future, and hurriedly took his leave.</p>
               <p>Hugo, the moment he was gone, threw himself upon a chair, and gave himself up to a thousand speculations as to the effect upon his father should he be made acquainted with his recent violence, and was well assured that, should Mr. Burton tell him, it would be with such exaggerations as would place his conduct in the most aggravated and criminal light. He could not know, however, how perfectly Mr. Burton's cupidity and meanness saved him from any difficulty of the sort he apprehended, or he would not have given the matter a second thought.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
               <head type="sub">A BRIEF RESPITE.</head>
               <p>THE reader will understand, from what has already been told, that the situation of our hero in the service of Mr. Burton was not likely to be any more pleasant than it had been; and it is no part of our design to give the full details of the petty meannesses of Lankton and Smith, or the more culpable scheming of Mr. Burton; but rather to note the effects of these and other early restraints and crushing forces upon an ardent, gentle, and affectionate spirit—ardent, gentle, and affectionate to the last degree when these characteristics were appealed to, but fierce and irascible, with courage which quailed at nothing, when these conflicting elements in his character were called into exercise by meanness, treachery, or anything which he deemed low or dishonorable. Such traits are almost always found connected with a highly poetic temperament, and particularly among artists and musicians, in a degree that, to an observing mind, would account for much in their characters which, to those who are more practical and matter-of-fact in their views and actions, seems evidence of unbalanced and ill-regulated minds.</p>
               <p>The time rolled wearily on, and the effect of the disgusting and distasteful employment in which Hugo was engaged wore daily upon him, and the appeals to that fiery spirit of which we have spoken grew more frequent as his three tormentors learned better how to arouse it. Young as he was, cankering care had already perched upon his heart, and morbid indifference to what the world calls business, accompanied with a sense of his own unfitness for what seemed the sole aim of life—making money—followed as naturally upon the course of training which had been adopted, as night follows day.</p>
               <p>Three weeks—to him dreary, gloomy, desolate—had increased the blackness of the cloud which overshadowed his ardent, hopeful spirit, and the vexations and insults to which he was now every day subjected, chafed him constantly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burton, seeing the successful working of his plan, and the eagerness with which Lankton and Smith seconded him, had changed his tactics; and as the disgust and annoyance of Hugo became more manifest, had softened in his manner toward him, and frequently spoke kindly and encouragingly to him—the more effectually to screen himself from any blame from Mr. Blanc when Hugo, tortured beyond all endurance, should leave his establishment and return to his father. Cunning man, that Mr. Burton! and a melancholy example of the effect of a stifling dollar-worship! He could remorselessly crush and ruin the finest aspirations, the most generous impulses, the most high-toned honor and honesty, in a miserable scheme to rid himself of the services of the son, who was too <emph>honest</emph> to do the dirty work required of him, in such a way as not to give offense to the father, whose business happened to be worth a few hundred dollars a year to him!—scheming to bring about such a result by such means that, after all the injury he had done to the boy, it might appear that the loss of his situation was entirely his own fault. In his artful management of all this he had frequently spoken to Mr. Blanc encouragingly of his son's promise and prospects, but was always careful to remark that he was sorry to see that, notwithstanding his general good behavior, the employment seemed to be distasteful to him—concluding by expressing the hope that this would be overcome as the boy became more interested in his new pursuits.</p>
               <p>What was Mr. Blanc's astonishment and mortification, then, when one Saturday night, about ten o'clock, as he sat in his little library, his feet resting upon the table, looking with<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6567-00000027"/> vacant eyes through the blue smoke which curled from his lips, as he puffed at his cigar, congratulating himself upon his son's bright prospects and mended habits, to see that son, haggard and careworn, enter the door and stand before him with an air of hopeless dejection!</p>
               <p>"Hugo, my son!" he exclaimed kindly, for almost the first time in his life, "what is the matter? Why have you left the store at this time of night? You look unwell—are you sick?"</p>
               <p>"No, father, I am not sick; but as soon as the store was closed, I hurried home to do what I have been thinking of all the week."</p>
               <p>"What is that, my son?" his father asked, apprehensively.</p>
               <p>"To ask you, father, to permit me to leave Mr. Burton. Such a life as I lead there will either ruin or kill me."</p>
               <p>"Why, Hugo," Mr. Blanc replied, "you astonish me! What new freak have you got into your head? The situation is a good one, and Mr. Burton seems, from what he says to me, to be pleased with you.</p>
               <p>"That may all be, father, but I find the occupation so repulsive to me, that I hope you will consent to let me return home."</p>
               <p>"My son, you can not expect to relish the business until you are sufficiently acquainted with the details to get along with ease and satisfaction to yourself."</p>
               <p>"Father," said the boy, with a shudder, "when that time comes, I shall be no longer what I am now—I shall have degenerated into a miserable, low, tricky knave, who hazards his soul to make a good bargain on a yard of ribbon."</p>
               <p>"Hugo, this is all nonsense, and results from your morbid sensibility and diseased fancy. You have confined yourself too closely to business, and must come home oftener, particularly on Sunday."</p>
               <p>"I have tried to do so, but for the past few weeks something has always occurred to prevent me. Mr. Burton wishes some one of us to be about the store on Sunday, and it has been so contrived of late that I am the one."</p>
               <p>"Ah!" Mr. Blanc exclaimed, as if he had discovered the secret of his son's discontent, "the young men don't treat you fairly—they impose more than your share of duties upon you."</p>
               <p>"Yes, they do," Hugo answered, emphatically; "but they are so miserably low in their habits and associations, that I am not surprised at any meanness from <emph>them.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Well," said his father, who had been writing as Hugo spoke, "take this note back with you to-night, and give it to Mr. Burton; I will take care that you are not imposed upon, at least. You will have permission to come out and see us to-morrow."</p>
               <p>Hugo, feeling that it was useless to urge his father any further, and having no hope of making him understand him, much less appreciate his wishes, bade him good-night, and while the scalding tears ran down his cheeks as he thought how bootless had been his errand, and how much more irksome would be the duties of the coming week for having indulged the hope that his father would consent to his quitting a service so distasteful, found his way back, he scarcely knew how, to the store. He retired for the night, under a volley of epithets, full of abuse and insult, from Smith and Lankton, for breaking in upon their slumbers at such an hour.</p>
               <p>"You've forgotten the regulations, young man," Lankton called out, after having first relieved himself somewhat in the manner above stated. "I'll tell old Burty if you come home so late again."</p>
               <p>"What do I care for old Burty?" Hugo replied, angrily.</p>
               <p>"He requires us all to be in at ten o'clock," Lankton continued, "and I'll raise the d—l 'if you don't mind!' You think you can come and go when it suits you, but you're mistaken—I'll have you discharged if you don't look out."</p>
               <p>"You could not suit me better," Hugo answered; "I would like to know what I could do to induce Burton to discharge me."</p>
               <p>"Lord! you must value your services high," Smith broke in here; "why don't you strike for higher wages?"</p>
               <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6567-00000028"/>
               <p>Hugo made no reply to this, but threw himself upon his cot without undressing, as had become his habit of late—giving expression by that very act to a feeling of indifference which was fast closing his mental and moral vision to whatever had heretofore seemed worthy of love, respect, or veneration. Contempt and dislike for both his fellow-clerks led him to avoid any further conversation with them, and all the severe and sharp things they said to him, after he laid down, could bring forth no reply, and he soon fell asleep (notwithstanding the murmur of their angry voices reached him), leaving them to digest what had passed as they pleased. Morning explained the result of their over-night council—they were gone to the country again, leaving Hugo, as they intended and believed, to his accustomed duty of "watching the store."</p>
               <p>When the note from his father was presented to Mr. Burton, after breakfast, that gentleman gave his consent to the request that Hugo should be allowed to spend the day at home, in as kindly a manner as it was in his nature to assume, and even hoped that he might have a pleasant day. Smith and Lankton were enjoying the day in their own way, and were even now exulting at the mortification of Hugo, when obliged again to stay at the store. But Mr. Burton preserved some show of consistency by telling Hugo that it would be necessary for himself to be at the store most of the day, and the absence of the boys would make no difference. He did not mention what could be the nature of the business that could make it necessary for the "pious Mr. Burton" to spend his Sabbath in his counting-room, and Hugo did not care to inquire, satisfied, from what he knew of the man, that he was a living mass of hypocrisy and lies from head to foot.</p>
               <p>Full of joy at the anticipated pleasures of the day, Hugo once more started upon the road to his father's house, which was about a mile from the village, his blood coursing through his veins, and his heart bounding high—boy-like—his troubles forgotten for the time, and that better and purer self giving impulse to every thought and action, in striking contrast with the gloomy and bitter feelings with which he had gone over the same road the night before. He stopped at Mr. Grattan's little cottage, and taking Mary with him, the two wandered or the rest of the way, through the old forest of chestnut and oak which bordered the road on either side, Hugo pouring into the ear of his attentive listener the trials and vexations of his situation, and she giving such sympathy and encouragement as was suggested to her pure young heart by the tales he told her occasionally clinging artlessly to his arm, and dwelling with intense interest upon his words, as he hurled his bitter invectives upon the cruel fate which made it necessary to his success in life to tear down the altars which had been erected by the Creator in his heart, and substitute in their places the gilded shrines of the money-god. Mary trembled fearfully as the fierce under-current of Hugo's bitter nature, for the first time, gushed to the surface in her presence. She had never seen him so before, and, as he now strode forward, beating the empty air with his clenched fist, as some act of duplicity or meanness was detailed to her, or wiped the scalding tears from his eyes, as he dwelt upon the menial offices he was obliged to perform, she gazed with blank astonishment at him, and thought how bitter must be the trials which could so completely transform such a gentle and loving nature; and her young brain was puzzled to understand why, to be successful in this life, it was necessary to divest ourselves of the warm, pure feelings of youth, and adopt in their stead the hard, unfeeling ideas of the business world. Her mind suggested many questions which it would puzzle philosophers to unravel. But the most enigmatical of them all, to her, was, why Hugo, of all others the most kind and generous, the most self-sacrificing, the most elevated and lofty in his feelings and objects—why he, of all others, should be subjected to such severe trials. This was to her inexplicable. And now that the fierce torrent of his feelings had once more broken loose, and he felt that here, at least, he had a listener who sympathized with him, and who, young as she was, could yet understand that innate something within him<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6567-00000029"/> which all the world else seemed to think his bane and his curse, his brain burned and his lips glowed with the fiery anathemas which he hurled upon the world at large, and the accursed fate which made him such a being as he was.</p>
               <p>Mary soothed him gently and tenderly as they went along, and her warm sympathies, poured out to him lavishly in girlish innocence, gradually quieted his ruffled feelings, and by the time they came in sight of his father's house, peeping out from its setting of green, he became more calm, and again gradually his better feelings were in the ascendant. Thus she was even in this early period of life, filling the gentle province of womanhood, and with those sweet graces and kindly affections known only to woman, she had soothed the turbulent spirit of her companion, and he now walked by her side, as gentle in manner and as noble and manly in bearing as she had ever known him.</p>
               <p>As they opened the gate at the foot of the lawn, Louise came running down the walk to meet them, her countenance full of joy; and taking each of them by the hand, the three went chatting merrily up toward the house. Hugo's good spirits were almost entirely restored in the presence of the two girls; still, there was a slight show of sadness in his manner, as he looked about him and thought how much he might, and how little he did, enjoy life; how much his father's circumstances enabled him to encourage and develop his tastes; and how little he felt disposed to do so. These unhappy thoughts were, however, but for the moment, and the glad voices of the girls, as they playfully disputed about the places they should visit during the day, soon dispelled the last shadow from his brow, and he entered into all their plans with a hearty earnestness, which at least evinced a determination to enjoy the present, whatever might follow. His mother met them at the door, and throwing her arms around his neck, imprinted a kiss upon his lips as fervently as if an absence from home of two weeks had been as many months; and leading him through the hall, ushered him into the little dining-room, where the morning meal only waited his arrival. Mr. Blanc, in his morning-gown and slippers, sat at the window with a city paper in his hand, as they entered, and leaving his seat, came forward and welcomed his son with a warmth quite unusual to him, and turning to Mary, even ventured a playful joke upon her for gallanting him home. Breakfast was served immediately, and the whole party sat down in high spirits, Mr. Blanc extracting his modicum from Hugo's apparent happiness, and arguing hence his final acquiescence in his views; Mrs. Blanc's share of the general good feeling, wife and mother like, being a kind of reflection of the feelings of those who were so near and dear; the girls running over with pleasurable anticipations of a delightful day in the woods; and Hugo himself, happy for the time because he had determined to be so, and already beginning to enjoy in advance a brief exercise of his beloved but proscribed art.</p>
               <p>Such was the morning party at Mr. Blanc's; and of the five persons who sat round the table, three at least were extracting all their pleasures from deceptive appearances; Hugo and Mary Grattan alone of the number being fully aware of the truth in regard to his situation and prospects at Mr. Burton's; and they, for the time, trying to forget the unhappy nature of their conversation a short time previous, and willing to gather pleasure and even hope from the most trifling circumstances. Hugo made not the slightest allusion to his unhappy situation, and the unendurable annoyances which surrounded him; and it would be safe to assert, if appearances were worth anything, that never a happier party sat down to Mr. Blanc's well-provided table. He was unusually communicative, and strange as it seemed to them, appeared to participate in the joyful anticipations of the younger members of the little party. Through all this, however, a keen observer might detect a shade of doubt, a kind of inquiring glance cast every few moments toward his son, as if not satisfied altogether with his manner; Hugo frequently caught his father's eye steadily fixed upon him, and divining the nature of his thoughts, shrunk more and more within himself. His natural affection for his father was overshadowed by his fear, and<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6567-00000030"/> whenever he met his eye in one of these fixed looks of inquiry, he trembled for a moment lest he should read his thoughts, and discover that in spite of everything the hidden fire still burned that would surely break forth whenever opportunity offered. A mutual deception was going on between Mr. Blanc and his son, growing, on the one part, out of fear and a disposition to please, whatever might be his own wishes, and on the other, out of a mistaken notion that sternness and determination would mold the boy into any sort of habits which were considered best for his worldly well-being. Mr. Blanc argued from his own case; he had been made a successful practical man, and why not Hugo, if the same means were adopted? The idea that there were any human impulses and aspirations that could not be stifled had made no part of his education, and in the main, perhaps, he was right; and this fact once established in his mind, he did not trouble himself to reason about consequences. Hugo <emph>must</emph> be a merchant; this was settled; and he doubted not that his present idols, once destroyed, all would go right afterward.</p>
               <p>Hugo's day at home was divided between happy conversations with the little home circle and rambles upon the mountain side with Mary and Louise, where he gave free reins to his ruling passion, thoughtless, and of course regardless, who was pleased or angry, and only seeking happiness, as all untrammeled youthful hearts will do, in his own way. Mary and Louise were equally oblivious, and each admired and praised the results of his fiery genius, which seemed to run wild with opportunity, and sympathized and loved, impelled by secret impulses which neither paused to analyze; and not until the sun had approached the western horizon, and the shades of evening began to steal over the landscape, did either of them seem to think or care for aught of this world, and were perfectly satisfied with the interchange of happy thoughts and sympathetic emotions in their own little company of congenial spirits. When, however, the rapidly closing day warned Hugo that he must return to his disgusting duties at Mr. Burton's, all his former feelings of dislike and antipathy returned with overwhelming force, rendered a thousand times less endurable by contrast with the pure and perfect enjoyments of the past day; and the cloud which had lifted only for a brief space, again settled upon his spirits. The two girls noted the change, and followed him back into the abyss from which their society had done so much to lift him into an atmosphere of purer and holier emotions. Scarcely a word was uttered as the three retraced their steps, each knowing how perfectly the others were understood, and feeling utterly incompetent to encourage hope for a happier state of things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Blanc had during the whole day studiously avoided any mention of Hugo's visit of the previous evening; and although it might have given him some fear at the time that his theory of training might be erroneous, he was willing to put faith in the appearances of content and happiness which his son had manifested through the day, and tried to flatter himself that the freak of discontent which the boy had exhibited on that occasion grew out of difficulties with his fellow-clerks, which would be easily remedied; and the kind treatment which he lavished upon his son all that day would not have been so highly prized by him, or so warmly cherished afterward, had he known to what to attribute it.</p>
               <p>Hugo, keeping as good a face as possible in the presence of his father, bade the family adieu, and started with Mary on their return, neither of them speaking until they arrived at the little gate which opened into Mr. Grattan's garden, when Mary, feeling that she must say something—must make an effort to raise his spirits—tried to encourage hopes which she did not feel. Hugo pressed her hand warmly, as they separated, and replied that he feared nothing but an open rupture with his father would break the chains which confined him. These words dwelt long in Mary's thoughts, and gave her an insight into the terrible alternative which had already arisen in Hugo's mind, and convinced her that <emph>he</emph> was already contemplating a step of which she shuddered to think.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
               <head type="sub">EFFECTS BECOME VISIBLE—DOWNWARD MOVEMENT—A NEW ADVISER.</head>
               <p>WEARY weeks rolled monotonously round, and found Hugo still drudging on in the service of Mr. Burton. A stolid look of indifference, from which he was seldom aroused, had of late become the fixed expression of his countenance, and, save when his sister and Mary Grattan visited him, he scarcely ever smiled. It would seem strange that his father should not, from these strong outward evidences, be convinced of the folly of driving his son further upon such an up-hill road; but Mr. Blanc, if he observed his son's wretchedness at all, only thought that he was passing through the necessary ordeal to rid him of his ideal "nonsense," after which he would feel and act much like other practical men.</p>
               <p>About this time there arrived in the neighborhood a stranger by the name of Grey, who built a little hut upon the borders of the lake, at the foot of a bold cliff, about a mile from the village, where he resided by himself, and gained his subsistence by fishing. This man's wants, which were few and simple, were mostly supplied at the store of Mr. Burton, and from the first time he and Hugo met, there had an intimacy grown up between them, which either would have found it difficult to explain if asked to do so. Grey was a stoutbuilt, hearty, active man, of about fifty, or perhaps sixty years, with a kind, generous soul shining out in every expression of his countenance—and it would have troubled him to tell what it was, in the demure-looking boy who always waited on him at Mr. Burton's counter, that attracted him so much. Hugo would also have had difficulty in explaining what it was that drew him so insensibly toward the kind old fisherman who entered the front door, at stated intervals, to make his regular purchases, and whose sunny smile seemed to lighten up even this gloomy den, and send a ray to warm up his own heart. Ever, when they met, the salutations would be exchanged—"Good-morning, my poor boy," and "Good-morning, Father Grey;" but neither one noticed the peculiar form into which these morning greetings had shaped themselves, or undertook to fathom the secret openings of the heart from which the terms "poor boy" and "father" welled up. And when these salutations were over, how eagerly would Hugo attend to all his demands, and how kindly and gently would he look upon the old man's every movement, as if irresistibly drawn toward him by some secret influence which he had no power to resist! And how often, when the little bills were filled and neatly tied up, and Hugo had walked to the door to bid him good-bye, would the old man detain him gently by the hand, and pour kindly expressions into his ear, full of sympathy and affection! And when the last gentle shake of the hand had been given, and warmly returned, and the kind old man's "Good-bye, my dear boy," died upon his ear, how would his heart sink, as he again entered the store, and met the cold, leaden, calculating gaze of Mr. Burton, the hyena eye of Lankton, or the sly, cunning, fox-like expression of Smith! How would he long to abandon his place, and dwell ever by the side of that noble old man, and find his chiefest pleasure in anticipating all his wants, and soothing all his sorrows, if sorrows ever visited his sunny heart! Then that other painful thought would come—Oh, if I had such a father, how happily would we glide down the current of life, each living but for the other, all our sympathies and affections uniting in one broad current, which should flow on uninterruptedly until death should separate them, only to be joined again in the ocean of eternity!</p>
               <p>In the midst of such outbreakings of the soul there would<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6567-00000032"/> come visions of yards of tape, bundles of tea, coffee, tobacco, snuff, feathers, tar, nails, oil, turpentine, and lampblack; and who among my readers will dare to doubt or wonder that such a nature, so trammeled, must either be emancipated, or degenerate into recklessness, dissipation, and perhaps crime? Let none say, either, that this character is too finely drawn—that it is a fancy of a diseased brain. Staggering through the misty mazes of the business world—broken, disappointed, wretched—trembling upon the brink of suicide, are to be found the wrecks of hundreds of men who have started in life, boys full of the fire of genius and the noble impulses which characterized Hugo Blanc, and who, with talents misdirected, have fallen by the wayside, or been ridden over and crushed by the Juggernaut of the Mammon-worshipers who crowd the avenues of life, mercilessly grinding beneath their heels the weak or faint-hearted who may chance to stand in their course.</p>
               <p>Bear with me, reader, as I take you down the rounds of the ladder whither we are following the steps of our hero, and which he descends, one by one, as certainly as if the whole course had been designedly marked out for him. The natural effect of the mode of training to which he had been subjected for the purpose of changing his thoughts and feelings, had manifested itself, first, in his open expressions of dislike, followed by a period of indifference; and when he began to give up all hope that his own feelings would be considered, this indifference was again followed by an ever-present wretchedness, which he endeavored to throw off by seeking companions and acquiring habits which hitherto he had despised and shunned as he would have shunned a loathsome disease. It has been said that misery makes us acquainted with strange bedfellows, and Hugo has certainly proved the maxim to be true. The thought has frequently come to him in the still hours of the night, and in the busy hours of the day, "If I can not be an artist—if I can not seek happiness in this world through the faculties which are most active and urgent for exercise, I don't care what I do." Under the impulse of these feelings, he has been frequently induced by his fellow-clerks to join them in demoralizing practices, and has formed associations in no way creditable to him, and, if he has ever thought of the result, his final conclusion has uniformly been, "I don't care."</p>
               <p>This same "I don't care" has sent many promising youths to perdition. The same "I don't care," it is probable—nay, almost certain—will be the ruin of all impulsive natures that are <emph>turned against themselves,</emph> no matter how, whether by force or necessity. Half the drunkards, half the criminals in the world, are made precisely in this way. Want of appreciation, want of sympathy, want of encouragement in congenial pursuits, and the stern necessity to adopt those that are uncongenial, tell the story—"a promising young man has died in the gutter, in the penitentiary, or on the gallows." Already had Hugo become at times wild, fierce, reckless, and latterly the burning poison of the intoxicating cup had been often applied to his lips, surrounded by rollicking companions, among whom he already began to figure conspicuously. Nightly orgies were held at a neighboring grocery, and, when the weary hours of business were over, Hugo often wandered to this place, at first from mere curiosity, and a feeling that any change from the ceaseless round of his daily employment would be a relief. And now he appears before us in the midst of one of these scenes, after having parted but a short time previously with his new-found friend, who now, with the exception of his mother and sister, and the gentle Mary Grattan, was the only one who ever brought to the light any evidences of that better self which had shrunk from sight, and retired into the inmost recesses of his heart, to escape the rude handling of a world whose sympathies were not with him. And now, more reckless and daring than any of his companions, when excited by the frequent potations in which they indulge, he unites his voice with theirs in boisterous songs of mirth, thus trying to deaden his sensibilities, never pausing to reflect that the remedy would be worse in its effects than the disease. He never thought except upon<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6567-00000033"/> one subject, and finding himself denied the privilege of gratifying his wishes here, he took as naturally to his present course as the mountain stream, checked by the falling avalanche, bursts at length through all barriers, carrying widespread ruin and desolation in its track. Choke up the natural impulses of youth, and they will inevitably burst through all barriers, and run riot, like the temporarily impeded mountain torrent.</p>
               <p>The grocery was closed for the night, and Hugo and his companions were in the street—the former, with heavy head and weakened limbs, tottering along between Smith and Lankton, who were purposely directing his steps toward the center of the village, the more effectually to expose his condition. Hugo was "on a spree"—not because he thought it manly, however—not because he loved to spree for the sake of spreeing, as many of his comrades did—not because he liked intoxicating drink for itself—but because "he didn't care;" and as his companions supported him reeling along the street, he would break out into maudlin laughter, or yell like a savage, as the spirit moved him, affording, by his wild antics, abundant amusement to his comrades, who shouted and laughed in the most boisterous manner. In the midst of one of these outbreaks, and while Hugo was dancing and singing at the top of his voice, "I won't go home till morning," the whole party were stopped at a corner of the street by a stout, well-built man, who, thrusting his companions aside, took Hugo by the arm, and, with an expression of heartfelt pain and surprise, led him out from the group, and walked him as hurriedly as his condition would permit into a cross street, and out upon an open piece of common which skirted the forest upon the lake shore.</p>
               <p>His companions huddled together, with various conjectures as to who this could be—some asserting that it was Burton, others that it was his father; but the truth was not arrived at until Smith came forward and asserted that it was old Grey, the fisherman. Then there was a long conversation among them, in which much that was mysterious in the character acter of the old man was discussed, and particularly his marked attachment to Hugo; after which the party separated and returned to their homes, without giving any further thought to him.</p>
               <p>Grey, in the mean time, had reached the center of the open space, where he sat the miserable boy down upon an old log, and seating himself by his side, chafed his throbbing temples with his hand until he—already assured who his companion was—should be in a condition to calmly listen to what he proposed to say.</p>
               <p>The moon broke out from a bank of clouds, and shed its mild rays upon everything around them, and danced in myriads of ripples upon the surface of the lake; while a cool breeze played with the profuse curls which adorned the temples of Hugo, arousing him to a full sense of his condition. With a cheek crimson with mortification, he turned to his friend, and in a tone of mingled shame and sorrow said to him:</p>
               <p>"Father Grey, this is a sad plight to find me in; but what else could I do to deaden this eternal torment which the accursed drudgery in which I am engaged keeps constantly burning into my brain?"</p>
               <p>"What else could you do?" Grey answered decidedly. "My poor boy, cut your throat; such a calamity would not fall more heavily upon a father's or a mother's heart than to follow you to a drunkard's grave."</p>
               <p>"I shall never be a drunkard, Father Grey; but I must escape in some way from the thoughts which burn and burn in my heart, until I begin to think sometimes that there is nothing in the world worth living for."</p>
               <p>"Never be a drunkard!" Grey exclaimed. "Hugo, you are now upon the brink of a precipice yawning black before you, down which thousands have recklessly plunged, and now lie writhing in unutterable torments at the bottom. But, my poor boy, what is the cause of the thoughts that 'burn and burn in your heart?'" he continued, taking his hand kindly.</p>
               <p>"The miserable employment in which I am engaged,"<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6567-00000034"/> Hugo answered, "into which I am forced against my tastes and inclinations, and where I am expected to do things from which my soul revolts. Father Grey, I can not learn to be dishonest, even in little things."</p>
               <p>"I am afraid, Hugo," Grey replied, "that your experience in your present place of employment, coupled with your natural aversion to pursuits of that character, has given you an early prejudice against the practical affairs of life which may eventually do you harm. All merchants are not Burtons, thank God; and there are many, very many, noble men among them."</p>
               <p>"I want nothing to do with the practical affairs of life, Father Grey. It is just this that makes me so miserable. When I was at school, I could not learn the common rudiments of arithmetic; and the calculations I am daily obliged to make, subjects me to mortifications which I can not endure, to say nothing of the utter detestation in which I hold this business of selling goods."</p>
               <p>"These difficulties and dislikes, Hugo, may, perhaps, be overcome in time."</p>
               <p>"Never, Father Grey, never! I feel it, never! The aversion I feel to the business, and my incapacity of success, have nothing to do with my own will, or they would have been overcome long ago; for I have exerted myself against hope, against inclination, against every yearning, to gratify my father's wish to make a business man of me, but to no purpose."</p>
               <p>"How long have you now been with Mr. Burton, Hugo?"</p>
               <p>"About eight months," he replied, looking earnestly into the old man's face. "Imagine yourself eight long, weary months in prison, with not one of God's sunny smiles to warm your heart, except what you steal through the grates of your barred window—would it not be terrible?" he continued, laying his hand confidingly upon Grey's knee.</p>
               <p>"Terrible, indeed!" the old man answered, musingly, and continued, as if to himself, "this is a strange boy—wild, furious, yet gentle and kind; angel and devil united; eight months, and already a drunkard. This must not be. I will assume the responsibility; I will do <emph>my</emph> best, at all hazards, to reinstate his better self."</p>
               <p>Hugo, who had only heard a word here and there of what his companion muttered, turned again to him with looks full of affection and confidence, and said—</p>
               <p>"Father Grey, you love me, don't you? you understand me. If <emph>you</emph> were my father, you would not make a merchant of me—I know you would not."</p>
               <p>This was too much for the kind-hearted old man, and he turned nervously and looked up to the bright moon that smiled so peacefully down upon them, occasionally wiping his eyes, as if to clear their vision. His thoughts ran back down the dim vista of past years, and dwelt with pleasure upon the happy, free, untrammeled pleasures and noble aspirations of another brave, dark-eyed youth, like the one who sat by his side, and perhaps as he followed up the connecting links between that period and manhood—even old age—there were struggles witnessed between the noble spirit of the boy and the stern, unrelenting demands of life which opened wide the channel of his sympathies for Hugo; for he turned again upon him a look so beaming with these feelings, that the boy instinctively grasped both his hands in his own, and pressing them warmly, asked, as if he had read the whole chain of Grey's thoughts—</p>
               <p>"What am I to do, Father Grey?—what am I to do?"</p>
               <p>"I have been thinking it all over, Hugo," Grey answered; "you have been now eight months with Mr. Burton, and, from a generous, manly boy, you have in that time gone down, down, until this night I find you a drunkard."</p>
               <p>"Oh, not so bad as that, Father Grey—not a drunkard!" Hugo exclaimed, interrupting him.</p>
               <p>"Yes, a drunkard," the old man answered decidedly; "you are as much a drunkard this minute as the poor sot who is carried from the ditch to the bosom of his starving family. There is no medium station; these are rapid strides, Hugo, from purity and innocence to debauchery, in eight<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6567-00000035"/> months; and as I look forward another eight months, I see that you will certainly have taken the next step from debauchery to crime."</p>
               <p>"Father Grey," cried Hugo, trembling like an aspen-leaf from head to foot at the old man's forcible manner of presenting his true position to him; "surely you do not think so hard of me!"</p>
               <p>"I do not think hard of you; I only wish to impress you with the truth of what I say to you. Now tell me what first led you to drinking with these low, boisterous fellows, among whom I found you to-night."</p>
               <p>"It would be a long tale, Father Grey; but my principal motive was to try to bring myself to a pitch of indifference to things that ordinarily were revolting to me. I wished to kill my own spirit and substitute in its place such a one as my father and Mr. Burton would desire to see animate me."</p>
               <p>"And did you reflect"—Grey asked again, greatly moved by Hugo's manner of illustrating his feelings—"did you reflect that the same process that would bring about this result would in a short time deaden your sensibilities to such an extent that crime would easily and naturally follow?"</p>
               <p>Hugo made no reply to this, but throwing himself across the old man's lap, buried his face in his hands to conceal his shame, and sobbed aloud.</p>
               <p>Grey, in the mean time, watched the effect of his words with a pleased smile, and when this ebullition was somewhat over he raised Hugo up again, taking him by the hand, and kindly brushing back his hair from his forehead, continued:</p>
               <p>"Hugo, you must leave that store, or you are ruined. I am but little acquainted with your father, but I will see him to-morrow and tell him so."</p>
               <p>"But suppose he will not consent?" Hugo asked, with fear depicted in every lineament.</p>
               <p>"Then," said Grey, rising and setting his teeth hard, "I will take the responsibility to advise you by all means to leave at any rate."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Father Grey," Hugo exclaimed, joyfully; "thank you for this advice; it strengthens me in a determination which I had formed already, and now that you approve of it, I shall feel no hesitation in acting upon it. I will stay with Mr. Burton no longer than until I learn that my father is determined to keep me there against every feeling of my nature. I will go away, let the consequences be what they may. Will I not do right?"</p>
               <p>"It is painful to advise you," Grey replied, "to act otherwise than as duty would dictate, but you must not be ruined; and if your father continues blind to the consequences of your stay at Mr. Burton's, there is but one thing left to do. I do not anticipate, however, that he will stand against such facts as I think I can present to him. In the mean time, my poor boy, go back to your prison and suffer patiently a short season longer. I will do my best to liberate you." Shaking him warmly by the hand, he kindly bade him good-night, and the two separated and returned to their homes, Hugo asking himself all the way what Grey could have been doing in the village at that time of night, and wondering more and more at the mystery which seemed to surround him.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
               <head type="sub">GRATTAN'S PERSECUTIONS—A PICTURE AUCTION.</head>
               <p>MR. BURTON was exceedingly annoyed by Hugo's patience with all the meannesses which himself and family practiced upon him, and it was greatly to his astonishment that Hugo still endured these inflictions with no more or those exhibitions of fiery temper which they all had endeavored by every art to provoke, and expected daily to see break out. He had, step by step, degenerated into the drudge of the establishment, and his oppressed spirit now only rebelled against the every-day meannesses of the business—the little and big lies which had to be told, all in the way of trade, to effect sales—the flattering and fawning to entrap unsophisticated and unsuspicious customers into larger purchases than their means would justify—the praising of articles which he knew to be worthless—the adulterations of various commodities, which were of every-day occurrence—the stealings of from sixteenths to eights (by the process of "thumbing") from every yard of goods that was sold—the running up bills of articles that were never purchased, against customers who never disputed about trifles. None of these could he ever, by flattery, ridicule, or threats, be induced to do, and the natural consequence was, that Mr. Burton's dislike continued unabated, and Hugo's presence when many of these transactions were going on, was a constant reproof to him and his two more apt pupils in "business," which annoyed them continually; and plots and counter-plots thickened around him to hasten the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">denouement.</foreign> But other influences were at work which would save them much trouble and much sin, and leave them time, if they felt disposed, to repent of the wrongs already committed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Grattan's studio, which was in a building but a short distance from Mr. Burton's store, was frequently visited by Hugo; but these visits only made him chafe the more against the unpleasant duties which were connected with his present occupation. Mr. Grattan could say nothing to encourage him, and he would come in and sit by him in a listless attitude, and earnestly note every touch of his pencil as some fine picture grew under his hand, and return again to the store more saddened and dissatisfied than ever. These visits were the cause of unhappiness to both parties, but neither had the wish nor the will to put a stop to them, and they were continued from day to day, during his leisure hours, by Hugo, who met his friend and parted from him without a word, carrying away fresh fuel for the fire which was implanted in his nature, and could not be quenched, except at the sacrifice of every desirable quality in his organization. No bursts of enthusiasm came from his lips as he witnessed the magic effects of Mr. Grattan's pencil; no questions were asked, or answers given; and if they conversed at all, it was upon subjects entirely unconnected with art. Both felt that <emph>this</emph> topic was interdicted, and as this was the one idea upon which Hugo ever dwelt, his visits were generally passed in silence, and followed by hours and days of melancholy, which grew every day more gloomy.</p>
               <p>On the morning after the interview with Grey, narrated in the last chapter, Hugo was early at his usual avocations, and an unusual air of cheerfulness attended all his movements. The promise of Grey had revived hope, and hope filled his youthful mind with airy castles. With one bound his elastic spirit had lifted itself from its deep despondency, and was once again in dream-land, reveling in the delightful creations of his hopes and fancies; and his sweeping and dusting was for the time not only not irksome, but almost poetical, surrounded as he was by the bright atmosphere of this new,<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6567-00000037"/> fond hope. No sooner, however, were these duties faithfully discharged (for however disagreeable they might be, he was always faithful, than he determined to visit Mr. Grattan, and impart to him his pleasant anticipations, and give vent to the joyful feelings which almost over came him, in the expectation of a release from his present thralldom.</p>
               <p>As he left the store full of these feelings, he saw Mr. Grattan approaching him, his head bent forward upon his breast, and his countenance full of dejection, evidently laboring under some recent cause of grief; and as he came nearer, Hugo ventured to say to him, that he was just on his way to pay him a morning visit. The sound of his voice seemed to be the first intimation to Mr. Grattan that any one was near him, so absorbed was he in his own reflections, and he turned and replied hurriedly that he was going to be absent from his room during the day; and without making any further remark, passed hastily down the street, leaving Hugo gazing after him, the expression of his countenance suddenly transformed from joy to commiseration for his friend, whose trials and reverses were well known to him.</p>
               <p>As he turned to retrace his steps, he saw upon the opposite side of the street the constable of the village dusting off a painting which he was exhibiting to a crowd who had collected there, and his curiosity induced him to cross the street and ascertain what was going on, a sudden fear coming over him that this might in some way be connected with Mr. Grattan's dejected appearance and abrupt manner. What was his surprise, as he approached, to recognize the very picture which he had seen upon Mr. Grattan's easel but a few days before, and from the sale of which he had told him that he hoped to realize enough not only to relieve him from some of his present embarrassments, but to furnish him means to visit New York, where he expected, materially, to better his condition.</p>
               <p>Full of the feelings which this discovery engendered, Hugo approached the constable, and asked what he was going to do with the picture.</p>
               <p>"I am going to sell it," the man replied, shortly.</p>
               <p>"What, at auction?" Hugo asked.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir-ee, at auction. Have you any that you wish to get rid of in the same way?" he asked, with a laugh.</p>
               <p>"Is it possible?" said Hugo, not noticing the question.</p>
               <p>"Yes, <emph>sir,</emph> it <emph>is</emph> possible," the constable resumed, "and I shall put it up as soon as I get enough here to bid right lively on it. It's a right nice picter, now, ain't it? They say it's one he took down there on the lake near the high rocks; durn my buttons if I can see how he does it!"</p>
               <p>"Who is selling this picture?" Hugo inquired, indignantly.</p>
               <p>"I am, or shall be pretty soon, if I get half a chance," the fellow replied, with a laugh.</p>
               <p>"No, no," said the boy; "I mean, who are you selling it for?"</p>
               <p>"Why, who sells <emph>all</emph> his pictures?" was the response.</p>
               <p>"Sharkey?" Hugo asked, more and more excited; is it Sharkey?"</p>
               <p>"You're a Yankee, sure, Master Hugo; but I always thought before that you're daddy was a kind of a Frenchman; but you guess too sharp to have any French blood in you." And he wound up the sentence with a coarse laugh at his own wit, which did not seem to strike any one but himself.</p>
               <p>"This is too bad," Hugo said, turning from the constable and advancing to Dr. Draper, the village physician, who had just joined the crowd. "This is the fourth or fifth picture he has sold for poor Grattan within a short time."</p>
               <p>"The infernal scoundrel," the doctor replied, angrily, "ought to have his neck broke! What motive can he have in persecuting Grattan in this manner?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know," Hugo answered, "but it has been going on ever since Sharkey came here."</p>
               <p>These remarks brought forth questions and inquiries from many persons present, all of whom seemed to be equally at a loss to understand why the individual named should so perseveringly harass the artist, who was an inoffensive, upright<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6567-00000038"/> individual, and far from possessing any disposition to give offense to any one.</p>
               <p>"Has there not been some difficulty between them before they came here?" inquired Mr. Grey, who had been a listener to the above conversation.</p>
               <p>Hugo turned and looked at the old man as he spoke, and was struck with a peculiar eagerness in his manner which puzzled him greatly.</p>
               <p>"True, true," the Doctor answered; "I believe the <emph>did</emph> come here nearly at the same time."</p>
               <p>"Is there any evidence"—Grey continued, pushing eagerly forward, and looking the Doctor earnestly in the face—"that they knew each other before they came here?"</p>
               <p>"Not that I know of, Mr. Grey," said Dr. Draper; "on the contrary, if one were to judge from appearances, they never met until they met here; and it is unaccountable what motive influences this scoundrel to purchase every note or account he can lay his hands on against Grattan, and then force payment in this way. It is inexplicable."</p>
               <p>"Not upon the supposition that they have met and had difficulty before?" Grey asked, still manifesting a strange interest in what was said.</p>
               <p>"This can not be," the Doctor answered; "my profession has made me somewhat intimate with Sharkey, and a good deal so with Grattan and his family, and I have never heard or seen anything to justify such a conclusion."</p>
               <p>Grey's countenance fell at this, and he walked away while the Doctor, turning to Hugo, said—</p>
               <p>"This Grey seems to be a very intelligent and well-spoken old man, for one in his position; where does he come from, Hugo?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know, indeed, Doctor; but I never loved an old man so well in my life."</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen," the constable cried but, breaking in upon this conversation, "I am about to sell this picture at the suit of Lawyer Sharkey, and I want you all to examine it well before I commence."</p>
               <p>Hugo elbowed his way up to the man, and asked him what was the amount of Sharkey's claim against Grattan.</p>
               <p>"You are devilish inquisitive for a <emph>young</emph> man," he answered, angrily.</p>
               <p>"I should like to know, nevertheless," Hugo persisted.</p>
               <p>"Well, it's to be sold to pay a note and interest amounting in all to two hundred dollars; that's all I know or care about it. Are you satisfied?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, thank you," said Hugo; and, turning around, he began to look about the crowd to see what was the prospect that the picture would bring a good price. As his eye wandered over the faces around him, he saw those only of two or three whom he thought would be likely to bid much, and these were strangers who were spending the summer months in the village, which was a great summer resort for those who had time and means. He saw Sharkey a short distance from him, now talking earnestly to the constable, and his keen, black, snake like eye, deep-seated in his head and almost concealed by his shaggy eyebrows, caused a chill to pass over him, and he turned his eye in another direction with a shudder, as though a serpent had crossed his path. A little beyond where Sharkey and the constable were standing, he saw Grey earnestly talking to his father, while his gaze was intently and eagerly fixed upon Sharkey, whose movements he watched with an expression of intense curiosity. Suspecting the nature of the conversation between Grey and his father, he stepped back and stood communing with himself for a few moments, when he ran across to the store, as if suddenly seized with some idea which must be immediately acted upon; and running through the store into the counting-room, where Mr. Burton sat, said to him, in a hurried voice—</p>
               <p>"Mr. Burton, I want to draw on you for a portion of my wages."</p>
               <p>"Are you going to leave?" said Mr. Burton, eagerly.</p>
               <p>"Not that I know of," said Hugo; "but I want to use a little money this morning, and would like to have it."</p>
               <p>"Money!" exclaimed Mr. Burton, with a stare; "don't<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6567-00000039"/> you know that your father agreed with me that you were to remain here one year for your clothing and board?"</p>
               <p>This announcement cooled Hugo's ardor quickly, and the process of cooling was much hastened by the evident grin of satisfaction with which Mr. Burton witnessed his disappointment.</p>
               <p>Without making any remark, he left the counting-room, recrossed the street, and took a place among the bidders, who were now examining the picture, which stood upon a pine box outside the door, leaning against the house at a sufficient height to enable most of those present to see it. As he stood admiring the painting, which was a large and beautiful landscape from nature, and thinking how degrading it must be to the feelings of poor Grattan to have his pictures disposed of in such a manner, the auctioneer mounted the stand, and after stooping to whisper to Sharkey, who stood on the ground at his side, cleared his throat and commenced in the following language, pointing to the painting: "Gentlemen, are you all ready? I'm goin' to sell this picter to the highest bidder, without reserve. As I said a while ago, it's a nice picter, taken from nater down here on the lake, near the high rocks, and any man that's ever been there would know it in a minit. This picter was painted by an individual who, like many of us, is unable to meet his liabilities, and, in the language of the poet, 'can't come to tea.'" The auctioneer paused here in his elegant and refined harangue to laugh at what he considered a good joke, and then proceeded in the same strain: "The painter, gentlemen, has an interestin' family to support, who want to cut a swell, and have no way of doin' it, and the upshot of it all is, that he's behind hand, and—"</p>
               <p>"There, Wapping!" cried Dr. Draper, shaking his cane indignantly at the constable, and breaking in upon the last sentence, which bid fair to be more refined than any that had preceded it. "If you have not decency enough to respect the feelings of the unfortunate author of this picture, I will, old as I am, undertake to teach you. We did not come here to listen to your nonsense."</p>
               <p>"I didn't mean any offense in the world, Doctor," the man replied, "and I don't know nothin' on earth agin the man."</p>
               <p>"You would do well, then," the Doctor replied, "to confine yourself to your simple duty."</p>
               <p>The constable, quite crestfallen at this unexpected interruption, continued in an altered strain—</p>
               <p>"Well, Doctor, I'm sorry I've said anything to wound anybody's feelings; I did'nt go to do it, and ther's enough said. We'll go on with the picter." He elevated his voice again, and resumed his old strain: "Gentlemen! as I told you, this paintin is a paintin' on the lake down 'yer—a picter from nater. Look at them trees, gentlemen, and the shadders in the water, and that are boat, and the mountings over on the other side of the water; and the frame, gentlemen—there's a frame for you! 'twill do to go on to any picter. That are frame, gentlemen, cost—cost no doubt—where is the gentleman that painted this picter?" he asked, elevating his voice and looking over the crowd. Here Sharkey pinched the speaker sharply on the leg, and he stooped his head a moment to him, an I replied to something which Sharkey said in his ear: "Oh, I only wanted to ask him what the frame did cost—"</p>
               <p>"Well, never mind that," said Sharkey, "go on."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, gentlemen, it don't matter what the frame cost, but, judgin' from the gildin', the cords and tossels, and all the other jim-cracks, it's none of your fool frames, and ought to sell the picter—what do you bid, gentlemen? Look at the frame, gentlemen—don't bid in a hurry—what is it?" he continued, looking over toward Burton, who had just arrived, in the hope of buying the picture at a speculation, and at the same time secure a debt of a few dollars against Mr. Grattan, whom he had time and again harassed for the amount.</p>
               <p>"What is it, Mr. Burton? it's a fine picter, and you won't lose anything on it."</p>
               <p>"Three dollars!" came from the little man.</p>
               <p>All eyes were now turned upon the individual who had<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6567-00000040"/> broken the ice, after all this labor on the part of the auctioneer, by such a magnificent bid; and Burton neither flinched nor shrunk from the scrutiny; for he was satisfied that he had done well, even at this, and had made shrewd calculation what would be his profits on the picture, if he should get it for four or five dollars.</p>
               <p>All this time the "three dollars! three dollars! three dollars!" of the auctioneer rang out in a loud voice over the crowd, and Hugo began to wonder if the picture would possibly sell for such a beggarly sum.</p>
               <p>At this point another dollar was added to the bid by Sharkey (who bid altogether by signs and winks), and the auctioneer turned to Burton, and sang out:</p>
               <p>"Four dollars, four dollars—shall I say another, sir?—four dollars, four dollars—why, gentlemen, this won't pay for the gildin'—do I hear another?"</p>
               <p>"Five dollars," said one of the strange gentlemen.</p>
               <p>"Ten dollars," came from another; and now the bidding continued pretty brisk, until it had reached about twenty dollars, where it hung again, and the various bidders crowded around to take another look at the picture before venturing further. The auctioneer paused while this was going on, and Grey, coming around, stood beside Hugo, and asked him—</p>
               <p>"Who is this poor fellow Grattan, Hugo?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Mr. Grey, he is one of the best men in the world; is it not a shame that such a picture should be taken from him, and disposed of in this way?"</p>
               <p>"Why does Sharkey engage in this kind of work?" Grey asked again, without noticing Hugo's question.</p>
               <p>"That is more than I can answer," said Hugo, "and it is a thing I have often wondered at."</p>
               <p>"Often wondered at!" Grey continued. "Have such things, then, been of frequent occurrence?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, Mr. Grey, every few weeks. Mr. Grattan hardly ever finishes a picture that this villain, Sharkey, don't get his hands on, and I have often seen Mr. Grattan completely broken down by the treatment he gets from him. Just now he passed me on the other side of the street, looking as if he had no friends in the world."</p>
               <p>"Has Sharkey any difficulty with Grattan?"</p>
               <p>"None that anybody knows of; but, since he came here, he has bought up every claim he could get agains Grattan, and this is the kind of use he makes of them."</p>
               <p>"Does he buy in these pictures himself?" Grey continued, apparently highly excited and interested by what he heard.</p>
               <p>"Yes, almost always—and, Father Grey." Hugo continued, in a low voice, drawing nearer to him, "what is more, he generally gets them for little or nothing, and, it is supposed, sells them for large prices again in New York, where he generally sends them."</p>
               <p>"Hugo," said Grey, his eyes flashing with unusual brilliancy, "he shall pay dear for this picture, if he gets it. You add the same amount that he bids, every time, and I will pay the bill if the picture is struck off to you.</p>
               <p>"You!" Hugo exclaimed, with a start, and looking at him as if he had not heard him aright.</p>
               <p>"Ask no questions," said Grey, in a low voice, "but do as I tell you. The bidding is about to commence again—I will see you after it is all over, when I have something else to communicate to you."</p>
               <p>With this remark, Grey walked carelessly out of the crowd, and seated himself upon a box in front of a neighboring shop, an apparently uninterested listener to what was going on.</p>
               <p>The auctioneer took up the last bid, and sang out, "Come, gentlemen, I have twenty dollars bid; who says twenty-five [a nod from Sharkey]? Ah, yes—twenty-five dollars, twenty-five dollars."</p>
               <p>"Thirty dollars," said Hugo.</p>
               <p>"Was that you, young man?" said the auctioneer, looking over the heads of those near him at Hugo.</p>
               <p>"Yes, it was me," Hugo replied. "I am bidding for another person—not for myself."</p>
               <p>"Oh, well, then, thirty dollars, gentlemen—thirty dollars," drawing out the words longer and louder as the sum increased.</p>
               <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6567-00000041"/>
               <p>A nod from Sharkey added another five dollars, and the thirty-five had hardly been announced before Hugo, happy to have it in his power to foil Sharkey, whatever might be his object, sang out, "Forty dollars," in a clear, determined voice, and received from Sharkey at the same time one of those piercing looks which seemed to freeze what it lit upon.</p>
               <p>"Forty dollars, gentlemen, forty dollars—did I hear you say fifty, sir? Forty dollars—ah, fifty dollars," he added, in reply to Sharkey's nod—"fifty dollars [turning to Hugo], fifty dollars, fifty dollars."</p>
               <p>"Sixty dollars," Hugo again cried out.</p>
               <p>"That's right, young man, I like your spunk. Sixty dollars, gentlemen, sixty dollars. You see, gentlemen, this picter is well tho't on by somebody—it's the picter they're biddin' on now, certain—it's more than the frame is worth—sixty dollars—sixty dollar—"</p>
               <p>Sharkey's nod followed, and seventy dollars were added.</p>
               <p>Hugo promptly added the eighty, and by this time Sharkey was glaring at him fiercely, and the crowd had gathered around the two with great interest in the result. During the pause that followed, Hugo's father, who had also become aware who was bidding so actively against Sharkey, came to his side, and asked, in a low voice—</p>
               <p>"How comes it that you are biddin, so bravely upon this daub of Grattan's?"</p>
               <p>Hugo blushed to the eyes at the unfeeling manner of his father, and told him of the arrangement but a few moments before made between himself and Grey.</p>
               <p>"Very nice!" his father exclaimed, contemptuously; "you will disgrace yourself. How is that old man to pay for such a picture? If you are the lucky purchaser, rest assured <emph>I</emph> shall pay no such bill."</p>
               <p>"But, father," said Hugo, in a low voice, "is it not a kindness to Mr. Grattan to prevent his picture from being sacrificed?"</p>
               <p>"No!" his father replied, in a voice sufficiently loud for most of those present to hear him, as he walked away; "it would be a kindness to you and myself if he was driven from the village."</p>
               <p>Sharkey, who had heard these concluding words of Mr. Blanc, and fancying that Hugo would not venture to bid further, advanced confidently to him, and said, "Young man, your bids will not be received any further unless you give satisfactory evidence that you are able to pay what you bid."</p>
               <p>"Oh!" Hugo replied, now full of excitement, and determined to bid on at all hazards, and run the risk of the disgrace his father had predicted, as well as <emph>his</emph> displeasure, "I am not bidding for myself, but for a gentleman who is able to pay, and I know how much he wants to bid."</p>
               <p>"Go on, then," said Sharkey, turning again to the auctioneer, with ill-concealed vexation—"ninety dollars!"</p>
               <p>"One hundred dollars!" said Hugo.</p>
               <p>At this Sharkey's face grew purple with rage, and he began to bid recklessly.</p>
               <p>"One hundred and twenty dollars," he added, fiercely.</p>
               <p>"One hundred and forty," said Hugo.</p>
               <p>At this moment Grey touched him on the shoulder in passing him, and said, in a low voice, "If he bids again, let him have it. Don't anger your father on any account."</p>
               <p>"One hundred and sixty," said Sharkey, looking still keenly at Hugo, to see if he could gather anything from his countenance.</p>
               <p>"I am done," the latter said, in reply to the look, and laughing as he spoke. "You can have the picture."</p>
               <p>At this a general shout rent the air at the manner in which Sharkey had been sold, and he looked at our hero as if he could have annihilated him on the spot.</p>
               <p>This matter settled, the crowd dispersed, Hugo going back to the store, feeling that he had in some way rendered Mr. Grattan a service, but not exactly understanding how; and now that the excitement was over, terribly fearful of the consequences of his father's disapprobation of his conduct.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">WELCOME NEWS—PAYING OFF OLD SCORES—THE CLERKSHIP AT AN END.</head>
               <p>HUGO saw nothing more of his friend Grey until late in the afternoon of that day, and he was in a fever of excitement to know what had been the result of his efforts with his father. Forty times during the day he had gone to the door, and standing on the step, had looked longingly up and down the street, in the hope that he would see him coming, only to be as often disappointed. Once, as he stood there, he saw Mr. Grattan go by again, with a flushed countenance and dejected air; and feeling deeply the mortifying circumstances which must have given rise to this unusual appearance of dejection, he said nothing to him, and Grattan passed on.</p>
               <p>At length Grey made his appearance, and walking up to the counter, where Hugo was at the time serving some old woman, stood near them, waiting patiently until he should be released.</p>
               <p>Hugo looked at his countenance in vain to catch some clew to his fate; it revealed nothing; it was neither sad nor pleasant, and he could not tell whether he was to remain a prisoner or to be free.</p>
               <p>He made no extra exertion to detain the old woman; and when she had packed away in her capacious pocket her little purchases of pins, knitting-needles, and tape, and taken from thence a dirty handkerchief, from one corner of which she had liberated a few pennies to pay for her purchase—after she had counted them over and over many times to see that they were right, hunted a long time through her pockets, and shaken her handkerchief, in search of a three-cent piece, and at length found it in her hand—after she had slowly counted all over again, and safely knotted them up in the corner of the dirty handkerchief, and stowed this away at the very bottom of her pocket, under a promiscuous collection of rags, patchwork, pipe, and tobacco, which she had laid out on the counter during the search—after she had gone to the door twice, brushed her dress, and returned again, to be <emph>sure</emph> that nothing was left behind—and finally, after she had gone out, leaving them alone in the store, Grey said to Hugo:</p>
               <p>"Well, my boy, I am glad to tell you that your father has consented that you leave this establishment."</p>
               <p>"What! immediately?" said Hugo, scarcely able to speak, so much had joy choked his utterance.</p>
               <p>"Yes, to-night," Grey answered, without seeming to enter into his feelings.</p>
               <p>Hugo waited for nothing further, but was hurrying toward the counting-room, when Grey called him back.</p>
               <p>"I am sorry to say, Hugo, that I did not persuade your father that it was best for you and all concerned that he should hereafter consult your wishes and inclinations in the selection of employment for you; and I could not have received his consent to your leaving at all, had I not convinced him, from what I told him of your treatment here, the kind of principles inculcated, and the effect that all these causes was having upon you, that to remain here longer would be your ruin."</p>
               <p>"What did he say?" said Hugo, eagerly.</p>
               <p>"He said that he was willing that you should come home until he could find a more proper place for you."</p>
               <p>"That is enough; once out of this den, I shall never enter another of a similar kind. Wait here, Grey, a few moments," he continued, almost beside himself with joy; "I will walk along with you as far as the turn of the road on my way home; and leaving Grey with a smile upon his face, pleased<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6567-00000043"/> at the manifest change in his appearance, he hurried back into the counting-room, and, without saying a word to Mr. Burton, who sat absorbed at the desk over his calculations, he commenced cramming into his little trunk all the loose articles belonging to him that were laying about the room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burton, at length attracted by his movements, turned around and looked at him with an expression of countenance that would have puzzled a physiognomist, and at length asked him, in a hesitating way—</p>
               <p>"What are you doing, Hugo?"</p>
               <p>"I am going home," he answered, without stopping in his movements.</p>
               <p>"Not without your father's consent?" Mr. Burton asked, drawing in his breath with difficulty.</p>
               <p>"No, sir; I have my father's consent."</p>
               <p>This answer alarmed Mr. Burton, and for a moment he fancied the thousand-dollar customer, who was so popular "in and out of church," had slipped through his fingers, and he began to blame himself for having put so many obstacles in the boy's way, expressly to render his position unendurable. After dwelling awhile upon these unpleasant fancies, he said, with an effort at the pathetic—</p>
               <p>"I hope, Hugo, that you have not forgotten so far what is due to me, as well as yourself, as to make any misrepresentations to your father in regard to your treatment here."</p>
               <p>"No, Mr. Burton," Hugo replied, without raising his head; "I have not been with you long enough yet to learn to lie."</p>
               <p>The little man's face crimsoned at this; but he had too much at stake to risk offending the father by any improper treatment of the son at this moment; and he went on—</p>
               <p>"Well, Hugo, I am glad to hear it; and although <emph>we</emph> are sorry to have you go, I shall be happy to testify that you are a faithful, honest boy, and"—he continued, while an abortive effort at a blush of shame played for a moment upon his leathern features—"fearing that my young men would not be agreeable companions for you, I some time ago prepared some recommendations for you, in the event you should leave; and—ah—let me see—yes, here they are," he continued, pulling them out of a pigeon-hole, and presenting them to him.</p>
               <p>Hugo, feeling the thrill of joy at his new-found liberty rushing madly through his veins, and being perfectly aware of the miserable hypocrisy and cunning that dictated this sentence, took the papers deliberately from his hand, and tearing them into a thousand fragments, scattered them about the floor.</p>
               <p>"Hugo! Hugo!" Mr. Burton exclaimed, frightened at this sudden burst of temper, and recollection the scene in the same place, where our hero had not hesitated to assault him violently with a poker, and not knowing where it might lead—"you don't know what you are doing; such passion will be your ruin; those recommendations would have procured you a situation anywhere."</p>
               <p>"I shall have no occasion for them," Hugo answered, eying him fiercely.</p>
               <p>"Why," said Mr. Burton, timidly, "you don't intend to quit the business, do you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I do," Hugo replied, still keeping his eye keenly riveted upon Burton's face; "I am satisfied that my experience has either been unfortunate, or that all men in this business are knaves, and I intend to have nothing more to do with them."</p>
               <p>Mr. Burton would gladly, if he had dared to do so, have struck the fiery youth to the floor where he stood, with the big round ruler which he held in his hand; but a due regard for his own safety, which prompted all his movements, and a praiseworthy attention to the interest of his pocket, made him swallow it all at a galp; and Hugo, simply remarking that he would send for his trunk in the morning, left the little man to his own reflections, and walked into the store again, where he met Smith and Lankton. He was hurrying by them without giving them any notice, to join Grey, who stood waiting upon the door-step, when Smith called out to him—</p>
               <p>"Where are you going young man?"</p>
               <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6567-00000044"/>
               <p>"I am going home," Hugo replied, turning upon him with flashing eyes and distended nostrils; "have you any objections?"</p>
               <p>"None in the least," Smith replied, with a sneer; "but I think old Burty might perhaps put in some, if he knew it."</p>
               <p>"Old Burty's objections would have little weight to-night," said Hugo. "I am going home, I am happy to say, not to return."</p>
               <p>"Oh! ho!" said Smith, stooping down low, putting his arms akimbo, and looking up with an expression of countenance purposely intended to irritate Hugo. "Oh! ho! you have determined, then, to leave your dishonest 'companions,' and take my advice?"</p>
               <p>The fire which had long been smothered in Hugo's breast from a desire to do nothing to incense his father, now that his freedom was restored, burned more fiercely than ever, and he longed to avenge upon Smith and Lankton the thousand insults he had suffered to pass without a word. Full of these feelings, he drew nearer to Smith, and asked—</p>
               <p>"What was that, Smith? I have forgotten what you allude to."</p>
               <p>"Why," said Smith, "you are going home, where you will have good nursing a while longer to prepare you more perfectly to buffet the rude world;" and as he concluded the sentence, he went through the pantomime of dandling an infant in his arms, and had sang with mock grimaces a few bars of a familiar lullaby—when his music and his fun were both suddenly interrupted in a manner quite unexpected. Hugo, who had drawn nearer and nearer to Smith as he uttered this sentence, darted upon him at its conclusion, when he was in the midst of his laughing mimicry, and striking him a blow with his full force upon the mouth, put a sudden stop to the singing, and stretched the singer at full length upon the floor, with his head wedged in between some coffee-sacks which were piled against the counter. Lankton, who had until this moment stood by only encouraging Smith by the hearty laugh which he bestowed upon his attempted ridicule, and glad of an opportunity to revenge himself upon Hugo, made a jump at his back with the expectation of grasping him round the neck from behind, and dragging him to the floor. Hugo, however, was too quick for him; springing aside with the activity of a cat, he caught Lankton by the collar, and adding his whole strength to his own movements as he rushed upon him, he hurled him head-first against the counter, on the opposite side from where Smith lay—and Lankey measured <emph>his</emph> length upon the floor, hardly knowing whether his head was on his shoulders or off, so violent had been the concussion. Here Grey and Mr. Burton interfered and separated the combatants. The former took Hugo by the arm and dragged him forcibly from where he stood, fierce as a young tiger, eying his two prostrate foes, and only waiting and wishing for a second attack, while Mr. Burton assisted his discomfited young men in rising to their feet, and kindly performed the office of relieving their outer garments of the filth and dirt which had attached itself to them in the fall. Smith's face presented such a comical expression that even Burton could not entirely suppress a smile. The blood was streaming from his nose in purple currents down over his dirt-begrimed face, and his lips were swollen and puffed out to Ethiopian magnitude; Lankton in the mean time was twisting his head about upon his shoulders as if to satisfy himself that it would ever settle into its right place again—and on opening his collar before the glass, perceived that a broad, blue band encircled his neck, testifying to the force of the concussion. For weeks afterward, Lankey appeared with his throat bound up in woolen cloths, and to the many and pressing inquiries of the curious as to the cause, replied that he had taken cold some how, and had a sore throat.</p>
               <p>Grey had, in the mean time, reached the open air with Hugo, and was hurrying him on out of the village in the direction of his father's house—his countenance still flushed with anger, his eyes flashing, and his fists clenched as if about to deal another blow.</p>
               <p>The old man said nothing to him until they had walked on<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6567-00000045"/> for some time, and were upon the road some distance from the village—when Hugo voluntarily stopped to re-adjust his cravat and collar, which had been twisted half around his neck—when looking at him smilingly, he said:</p>
               <p>"How do you feel <emph>now,</emph> young man?"</p>
               <p>"I feel," Hugo answered angrily, "as if I would like to go back and give old Burton a taste of what the others got. I shall never be satisfied that I didn't break a stool or something over <emph>his</emph> head."</p>
               <p>"Why, Hugo, you are a perfect little brigand."</p>
               <p>"No, Mr. Grey, I am no such thing; but I have suffered so long and so patiently in that school for rascals of old Burton's, that when Smith insulted me, and Burton and Lankton both enjoyed it so much, my blood boiled, and I determined to leave them some mark of my regard. I am only sorry that old Burton didn't interfere soon enough to come in for a share."</p>
               <p>"You talk, young man," said Grey, patting him on the back, "as if you were a second Hercules, or a giant, at least."</p>
               <p>"Father Grey, I feel like a giant, and to endure what I have endured for the last eight or nine months, would make any one perform Herculean feats."</p>
               <p>"Well, to be serious with you, Hugo, although I am opposed to brutal, personal encounters, as a general rule, I can not blame you much that you punished those two rascals as you did. They richly deserved it; but however much Mr. Burton may be to blame for winking at their petty annoyances, it is far better that you did not offer any violence to him. And now," he added, as they resumed their walk, "you are free, for a time at least, and it is better to lay aside entirely your angry feelings, and forget, if possible, the annoyances of your past position as a merchant's clerk, and think of your future. You are evidently in no way fitted for active business pursuits, and have an organization at war with most of the objects which men consider alone worth living for; but, my poor boy, it is exceedingly doubtful whether, even with your father's consent to your wishes, you will not find more of unhappiness than happiness in your future experiences."</p>
               <p>"Do you not think my father will permit me to resume my sketching, Father Grey?" Hugo asked, evidently fearful that this pleasure would be denied him.</p>
               <p>"I hope he may, but I fear not; I talked to him upon this subject, and he treated it with but little patience; and observed, that whatever might be the natural bent of your inclinations, it was his duty, as a father, to prepare you to 'take the world as it is.' Do you understand this reasoning?"</p>
               <p>"No, I do not, Father Grey; it may all be right and proper, and I may be doing wrong, but I can not help it. I have the feeling too strong within me to resist it, and I must and will be permitted to be happy in my own way, or," he continued, looking firmly into the old man's face, "I will deliberately throw myself away."</p>
               <p>"You would gain nothing by such a course, Hugo; on the contrary, you would not only entail certain misery upon yourself by it, but you would render all who are interested in you equally miserable. No, no, Hugo, it is not reason that suggests such wild threats; this is simple impulse."</p>
               <p>"But would not those who are so much interested in me feel equally unhappy to see me eternally toiling through life in a calling for which I was entirely unfitted, where failure would be inevitable, and which would make me miserable forever? Did God give me my tastes, Father Grey," he said, solemnly, laying his hand upon his companion's arm, "or is there no God, and does everything exist by mere chance?"</p>
               <p>"Hugo," said Grey, looking at him with a start of surprise, "you astonish me! Is it possible that such reflections as these have already found a place in your mind? Be exceedingly cautious, my dear boy, how you indulge them; they are the first evidences of dawning skepticism; trust ever in an overruling Providence, and never suffer your mind to waver a moment upon this subject."</p>
               <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6567-00000046"/>
               <p>"Did Providence give me my tastes, Mr. Grey?" Hugo persisted.</p>
               <p>"Undoubtedly, my son."</p>
               <p>"So <emph>I</emph> believe, Father Grey; and I feel and acknowledge His goodness, and am more imbued with kindly feelings toward every living creature, when these tastes influence me, than at any other time. But, Mr. Grey, whenever I am asked to throw aside these feelings, and try to make a business man of myself, I feel that the devil is at my elbow."</p>
               <p>If Grey had been astonished before, he was now petrified, and he looked at Hugo without the power to reply, so much did he marvel at this evidence of an under-current of reflection, which he only lacked the power to express more fully and forcibly. To see this boy, just verging upon the age of seventeen, one moment sullen, stupid, indifferent, the next fiery, fierce—revengeful, almost—then again gentle and as full of affection as the most loving child, and, added to all this, to hear him express sentiments upon subjects which he had supposed him incapable of comprehending, completely baffled the old man, and he scarcely knew how to reply. He felt that Mr. Blanc had a character to deal with for which he was illy fitted, either by education or his habits of thinking, and that <emph>his</emph> practical views and the boy's ideal temperament must ever be at war unless mutual concessions were made.</p>
               <p>Hugo, during this time, had been walking along by Grey's side, his head bent forward, and his whole manner depressed and dejected. When they arrived at the point where the path that led to Grey's hut diverged from the road, the old man stopped and addressed him in these words:</p>
               <p>"My poor boy, I have been so surprised at expressions you have made to me, and the deep thought evinced in them, that I find myself puzzled to answer you or to give you advice—a task more difficult, as my own feelings and tastes harmonize so perfectly with yours—but we can not disguise from ourselves, if we would, the fact that the great world in which we live contains but few who sympathize with us. And if these tastes and impulses are an emanation from Deity, as I have no doubt they are, and are intended for our good, it is a sad reflection indeed, that the world has become so perverted in its tastes, so corrupted in its morals, that the few who possess them must journey through life without sympathy or encouragement, without congenial companionships or associations, and, after a life of unheard-of struggles, die unknown and unwept. But such is the fact, and it is this that makes your father insist upon your learning to live like those who fight the battle of life, reckless of the weapons they use—for the shadow of happiness, without ever enjoying the substance. But, Hugo, there is too much in you to be sacrificed for such reasons as these, and I have a lively hope that your tastes may be gratified, and a reasonable amount of pecuniary success realized at the same time."</p>
               <p>"Whatever may be the result," Hugo answered impressively, and laying his hand upon his heart, "these internal promptings shall be obeyed, and sooner or later I will look for happiness in my own way. If misery follows, one of two things is certain—either God has been wrong in giving me these irresistible yearnings, or the world is wrong not to encourage them."</p>
               <p>"Your idea, Hugo, can not be controverted either by subtile philosophy or cunning sophistry, but never suffer your faith in the wisdom of Divine Providence to be shaken for a moment, whatever your trials may be, or however sad and bitter may be your experience of men. This faith once lost, with your temperament, consequences would inevitably follow too bitter and terrible to contemplate. Good-bye, my dear boy," he added, as he turned from the road into the path; "when shall I see you again?"</p>
               <p>"I shall come down and see you the very first opportunity. Good-bye, Father Grey—good-bye;" and as the old man walked away, Hugo sat himself down upon a stone beside the road, and, for the hundredth time since their acquaintance, asked himself who this strange, kind old man could be, who exercised such a wonderful influence over him. He felt sure that he was not what he seemed, and there was something in<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6567-00000047"/> his manner that spoke clearly of happier scenes and better circumstances than he now appeared to enjoy. There was a refinement in his sentiments, and a purity and earnestness in his religious views, that made a deep impression upon him, and he longed to know by what unhappy reverses he had been reduced to his present lonely condition, and how, amid these reverses, he had yet preserved uncontaminated his youthful feelings and elevated tastes.</p>
               <p>The shades of evening began to settle upon the earth, and Hugo pursued his way homeward, where clouds were yet to cast their gloomy shadows across his path.</p>

               <p>READER, Hugo is at home; and if you have appreciated the effect of the experiences of the past few months of his career, you will understand the emotions which caused the deep-drawn sigh as he closed the little gate at the foot of the lawn in front of his father's house, on the evening of his release from the service of Mr. Burton.</p>
               <p>He is at home, in one sense of the word, and in another, not at home; for he is now to feel the depressing influence of another kind of tyranny, which, acting first upon his father, is through him visited upon the son—the tyranny of public opinion, more terribly oppressive and irresistible than any other that ever scourged the earth, less patiently endured, and more hopelessly contended against. Public opinion, which bows and cringes, bends the supple knee, yes, crawls in the very dust, and licks the gilded trappings of Mammon; while modest merit, starving in a garret, has none of its sympathies, because, forsooth, not flaunted before its eyes in gilded trappings! Public opinion, which turns fools into lawyers and doctors, men of refinement and intellect into petty traffickers in calicoes, ribbons, and gew-gaws, and dams up and perverts all the pure channels of the human heart, to swell the offerings at the shrine of fashion and arrogance, the handmaids of the great money-god! Public opinion, which causes fathers to wrong their sons, and mothers to sell their daughters! Public opinion, which passes the artist, the<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6567-00000048"/> musician, and the literary man with cold neglect, and elevates the brainless fool who can exhibit the greatest amount of glitter and tinsel, to the highest seat in its synagogues! Public opinion, which forces the minister of the gospel to relinquish his vocation or his salary unless he is willing to cater to its depraved and perverted tastes, and which drags genius through the filth and dirt of want, in rags and wretchedness! Public opinion, which villains and mountebanks know how to use for their own base purposes, but which good men fear and tremble at—which countenances dishonesty in all the avenues of public and private life, and meets honest, heartfelt devotion to real moral and refining influences with a ribald laugh for its impracticability.</p>
               <p>Under the weight of these depressing influences, Hugo's hours passed listlessly by beneath his father's roof, or were dreamed away upon the lake shore, in the forest, or on the mountain side. Occasionally the demands of the soul would be gratified; and at such times, though without ambition or fixed purpose, he would work in a frenzy of excitement, which would be followed again by <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ennui</foreign> and listlessness.</p>
               <p>Frequently he would wander away through the forest for hours, and when fatigue seized upon his limbs, he would throw himself upon the ground, and, looking into the blue vault above, ask of the unseen spirits that sympathy and affection which was so rare on earth—breathing prayers to the great Dispenser of good and evil, that he might have strength and courage to follow in the path marked out for him, without fainting or falling by the way, and that he might prove an humble instrument through whom, at least, a new efficacy might be given to influences which appeal directly to the hearts and souls of men. Such was his ambition.</p>
               <p>Gradually, as time wore on, these feelings became stronger, and every day found him a busy worker with his pencil, whether in or out of doors, and there seemed to be more method, as well as determination, in his efforts. His little room at home had, quite unconsciously to himself, assumed much the air of an artist's studio, and the varied and beautiful works there scattered about might well entitle it to such a distinction. Although he instinctively avoided his father, he now worked diligently, as if he had, at least in his own mind, settled the "to be or not to be" of his future, and resolved at all hazards to go forward and win, or lose all. His sketching apparatus, neat and portable, was suspended across his shoulder early in the morning when the weather was pleasant, and he would seldom be seen again until late in the evening, when he would return, and, cautiously entering the house, steal up to his room, and spend the evening in dreaming over the treasures which had been accumulated during the day. The pleasures of this kind of life were constantly embittered, however, by the consciousness that what he did was done by <emph>stealth,</emph> and against his father's known wishes and views; and even the sympathy and encouragement given by his mother and sister came stealthily, and with evident signs of fear. Hugo felt that he was standing upon a mine, the explosion of which was only deferred until some accident should reveal to his father again the nature of his pursuits.</p>
               <p>Mr. Blanc had, during this time, also busied himself in his own affairs, as if willing to be relieved of the vexation attending his efforts to turn his son's mind to the practical affairs of life; and for the time, although every member of the family was perfectly aware of the slumbering storm which might any moment burst forth, there seemed to be a lull, which was equally grateful to all, and during which both Hugo and his father were nursing feelings entirely at war with each other, and which would render the storm more violent when it did come.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Blanc and Louise would frequently sit for hours in Hugo's room while he was at work, and their mutual hopes and fears were at such times fully discussed. But the moment the little gate at the foot of the walk closed, announcing the arrival of the father, the little circle would break up, and the drawings and sketches would be hastily huddled into their hiding-places.</p>
               <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6567-00000049"/>
               <p>Mary Grattan and Louise were often the companions of his out-door rambles, but these rambles were gotten up and terminated in secrecy. The sweet, guileless nature of Mary, and the unbounded affection of Louise, compensated for many of the unpleasant features in his present mode of life; and these stolen pleasures drove from his mind much of the despondency which he would other wise have experienced.</p>
               <p>Frequently, in his wanderings, he would stop at old Grey's, and many times the kind old man would take him out upon the lake to show him some view which could be seen better there, and sit watching him as he sketched it with as much interest as if he had been really his own s n, as he frequently so affectionately called him.</p>
               <p>At such times they would converse freciy together upon all subjects of interest to either; but Grey seemed to take especial pleasure in facts which he gleaned from Hugo in regard to certain characters which figure in our story; and above all did he seem concerned for poor Grattan, and indignant at Sharkey, who seemed to be his evil genius.</p>
               <p>He had learned from Hugo that Grattan had moved to the village a few months before, and was shortly afterward followed by Sharkey, who immediately commenced a system of annoyances which had reduced him almost to beggary—for what object no one could divine, as no one knew whence either of them came, or could throw any light upon their past history. He learned from Hugo that Grattan had no companions, but wandered about the mountains and the lake shore, extracting such "tolerance of life" from his profession as could <emph>be</emph> extracted, with the knowledge that his family were on the verge of starvation; that he was frequently overwhelmed with long fits of melancholy, out of which there would occasionally shine forth as kind a heart and as noble a spirit as ever animated a human being.</p>
               <p>He learned, in like manner, that Sharkey was sly, cunning, and far-sighted, not only as regarded his objects, but as to the means through which he obtained them; and that his marked persecution of Grattan had already excited the notice of the villagers, and was the subject of frequent conversations among them. That they had never been acquainted before, Hugo felt quite certain, as he had been assured of this fact by Grattan himself; and the opinion was gaining ground that an inordinate desire to make money was Sharkey's only motive; and that in the absence of business in the legitimate channels of his profession, he did not scruple to speculate upon the labors of poor Grattan, who, having no friends to aid him, could only endure on, and try to hope against hope.</p>
               <p>All these facts Grey would listen to with the most rapt attention; and still unsatisfied when all had been heard, listen to a repetition without ever seeming to tire of the subject. And then when the story had been told and retold, the old man would bend forward, and, resting his head upon his hand, seem to commune with himself; while Hugo wondered what there could be in all this that seemed to interest him so much.</p>
               <p>Firm in purpose, diligent in labor, Hugo began to exhibit some of the characteristics of approaching manhood; and to his firmness and application were added those next best qualities, ambition and self-reliance. Through the aid of these, his progress was rapid, and, profiting by the early lessons of Mr. Grattan, his manner of study was well directed, and he was gathering from everything that he saw around him the materials which in after years were to be wrought into works of art which should give him a name and a place among men. Mountains, lakes, rocks, trees, herbage—everything in nature—he studied with an ardor which knew no fatigue, and which shrunk from no self-denial, and his whole energies seemed to be centered upon one object.</p>
               <p>There came from the village about this time rumors of the mysterious disappearance of Mr. Sharkey—a disappearance as mysterious as had been his appearance—and speculation was rife as to what had become of him; some entertaining suspicion of foul play, and others only thinking that fear of detection in some rascality in which he might have been engaged before he settled there, had taken him off in his own way.</p>
               <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6567-00000050"/>
               <p>Search was made for him in every direction by the proper authorities, and the fact that his clerk disappeared a few days afterward as mysteriously as his master, carrying all his papers and effects with him, settled the public mind in the conviction that the two had been engaged in some former villainies, and had fled, perhaps, from some suspicions that their whereabouts was known.</p>
               <p>Hugo carried the news to Grey immediately after he heard it, and the old man seemed to be as profoundly astonished as everybody else, asking a thousand questions in regard to the matter, and venturing suggestions as to the reasons which might have prompted him to leave; but finally, when the equally mysterious disappearance of the clerk was mentioned to him, settling down upon the prevailing belief that it had been premeditated.</p>
               <p>Next he carried the news to Mr. Grattan, whom he expected to find rejoiced to learn that his persecutor had been removed by death, or otherwise, but who, though he seemed unusually agitated by what he heard, only replied to his congratulations by laying his hand upon his heart and saying, "It is too late, Hugo; the fires that have been lighted here by a world of misfortunes will consume me, and there is no rest until I find it in the grave."</p>
               <p>"You must not give up, Mr. Grattan," Hugo ventured to reply, "because a villain has been allowed to persecute you so long; genius like yours must command attention and meet with reward."</p>
               <p>"I do not give up," Grattan replied, "nor shall I while those beneath this roof are dependent upon me; but the youthful fire which once prompted me, and if it had been cherished would have placed me in an independent situation long before this, is nearly burned out, and there is scarcely enough left to be fanned into a flame."</p>
               <p>"Do not give way to these depressing emotions," Hugo answered, earnestly, his heart bleeding for the sufferings of his poor friend, whose sorrows and griefs, he thought, might be but a foreshadowing of his own. "Do not give way, Mr. Grattan, just when hope should beckon you forward once more; make one more effort, and I feel that it will be crowned with success."</p>
               <p>"I shall make one more effort, Hugo, and if that fails—no matter," he added, after a pause, wiping the perspiration, which stood in large drops, from his forehead, and then continued, "I shall probably go to New York soon."</p>
               <p>"Good!" said Hugo, joyfully, "good! and I promise you, Mr. Grattan, <emph>I</emph> will join you there before long; we will fight the battle side by side, and stand or fall together."</p>
               <p>Mr. Grattan averted his head, and only acknowledged his gratitude for this exhibition of sympathy and regard by a nervous pressure of Hugo's hand. As soon as his emotion had a little subsided, he said:</p>
               <p>"I started in life, Hugo, with as lively a hope and as ardent aspirations as you, but see what they have brought me to! Even mended prospects, could they be realized, would scarce restore my former self; the rude buffetings of the world have left but a mere wreck."</p>
               <p>"Not so, Mr. Grattan; you have a kind heart, full of generous emotions and warm sympathies, which, once relieved from its present burden of care and sorrow, will find no room for other and baser passions. I feel it, Mr. Grattan—I know it."</p>
               <p>"Ah, Hugo! the gold which has been once hammered and beaten almost to transparency, never resumes its original shape; and the better feelings of the heart, which the world constantly trifles with and abuses, never return to their original freshness. I feel here," he said, laying his finger impressively upon his forehead, "a bitterness toward that world against which I have had to fight from my earliest recollection, single-handed, that can never be replaced by the hopefulness and confidence of my youth."</p>
               <p>"Oh! Mr. Grattan," Hugo exclaimed, moved almost to tears by his words, "these thoughts are too bitter; do not indulge them; surely better things are in store for you. Providence can not always permit the deserving to suffer."</p>
               <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6567-00000051"/>
               <p>"Well, Hugo, my heart bleeds and my brain burns; we will talk no more upon this subject. Hope is not yet entirely dead; if it were," he added, with another of those mysterious pauses, and concluded, "no matter, no matter—I should not talk in this strain to you. Your path may be bright; why should I throw a gloom over it?"</p>
               <p>Hugo took him by the hand, deeply affected by what he heard, and feeling that he would only increase his unhappiness by further conversation upon this subject, bade him good-bye, and walked slowly toward home, revolving in his mind the strange manner of his friend, which he could not help thinking had some deeper cause for this unhappiness than even his straitened circumstances and intolerable vexations. Could he have anything to do with Sharkey's disappearance? The thought for an instant rested in his mind, but was as instantly banished. What was the meaning of his agitation and his mysterious pauses? All was unintelligible, yet Hugo felt sure he could do no crime, and this conviction relieved him of the fearful doubts which for a moment he had harbored. As he entered the wood, he saw Mary coming hastily toward him on a path which led to the rear of the house, and he paused until she came up, with tears in her eyes, and, taking him by the hand, acknowledged, that she had been a listener to the conversation just closed between himself and her father. "I could not let the opportunity pass, Hugo, without telling you how grateful I feel to you for your kind efforts to throw off the load of grief and trouble which seems to weigh him to the earth."</p>
               <p>"Do not weep, Mary," Hugo answered, pressing her hand kindly; "I feel that I am poorly fitted to pour balm into your father's wounds, who am myself about—rashly, perhaps—to enter upon the same road that he has traveled, and who have already experienced some of its terrors. But, Mary, I must still believe that there is hope, and I honestly told your father so; he will yet triumph over his difficulties."</p>
               <p>"I am afraid, Hugo," the girl replied, "your kind heart leads you to express hopes which your reason does not sanction."</p>
               <p>"No, Mary, from my soul I feel your father s merit, and I believe it will meet its reward."</p>
               <p>"Hereafter," she said, despairingly.</p>
               <p>"No, here. Let your father place himself in a situation where his merits can be known, and I have no fear for the issue."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Hugo, Heaven grant that your words may be prophetic!"</p>
               <p>"They are, Mary—they are. Your father is going to New York, and I shall be there to witness his triumph."</p>
               <p>"You, Hugo!" she exclaimed, with a start; "are you, too, going to leave us? We shall then be lonely indeed."</p>
               <p>The close of this sentence was uttered with such a tone of real sorrow that Hugo paused a moment, filled with a strange, joyful thrill, before he replied, taking her by the arm—</p>
               <p>"Not a word of this, Mary, for your life. A storm is gathering over my head which has not yet burst; when it does, I shall join your father in New York."</p>
               <p>"He will not, then, be cut off from <emph>all</emph> sympathy," said Mary, joy shining through her tears; "and however much we may miss you, we shall be happy in the knowledge that poor father has your society, which will go far to enliven and cheer him."</p>
               <p>"Yes, Mary, I will be as devoted to him as if he were my own father, and whatever rough experiences may come, we will meet them together."</p>
               <p>"God bless you, Hugo, and may He shower upon your path through life nothing but flowers and sunshine. You have made me happier and better, and I feel animated with new hope."</p>
               <p>"Cherish it, Mary—cherish it. Never let your sunny heart be overshadowed with sorrow, for," he added, smiling, and gently drawing her to his side, "you would no more be yourself."</p>
               <p>Mary blushed slightly, and hung her head, more at the manner than at the words, and, after expressing over and over again her gratitude to Hugo for his kind sympathy for her<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6567-00000052"/> father, they separated—Mary with a flushed cheek and happy face, much in contrast with her appearance at the commencement of the interview. The secret springs of feeling which led to this change she did not attempt to fathom. Hugo had partially removed her apprehensions for her father, and had talked so kindly and feelingly to herself that she felt happy, without asking why. She was yet too young to philosophize or analyze, and she returned to the house, perhaps more ignorant than the reader of the true cause of the peculiar frame of mind in which she found herself, leaving Hugo to pursue his way home, nursing a similar spring of pleasure—better understood, perhaps—and musing upon the events which were hastening himself, as well as Mr. Grattan, on to a crisis.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
               <head type="sub">MR. GRATTAN'S DEPARTURE—OLD BURTON AND THE CONSTABLE—THE MERCHANT TERRIBLY ENRAGED AND AS TERRIBLY SCARED.</head>
               <p>WE will now introduce the reader to the abode of genius—to the house and home of poor Grattan; after which we will transport him to that of the practical Mr. Blanc, where scenes are transpiring which have an important bearing upon our story.</p>
               <p>Two weeks have elapsed since the events recorded in our last chapter. It is evening, and Hugo Blanc, Mary Grattan, and her three brothers are sitting in the little parlor of Grattan's cottage, looking out with sad countenances upon the road that leads to the village, whence is every moment expected the coach which is to bear from the bosom of his family the husband, the father, and friend. Mrs. Grattan and her husband are in the adjoining room, and the smothered voices, mingled with heart-wrung sobs, which reach their ears, wring sympathetic tears from the hearts of those who compose the little group collected around the front door. This is not the commonplace parting from his wife of the man of business. Her tears, if she has any to shed, are forgotten in the visions of new dresses, jewels, and finery, for herself and children, which generally grace his return. It is not a separation between those who have no feelings in common; it is not a separation of hearts which have long since forgotten to love; it is not a parting between the brutal man of the world, and a wife whose heart-strings have been a thousand times stretched to their utmost tension by gross<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6567-00000053"/> neglect and unkindness, and who now goes forth to mingle in new scenes of vice and folly. Nor is it a separation between the beastly sot and the wife who has learned that her bitter lot is but to endure; but it is the sundering of two hearts which have been joined in love, and have learned to love more and more, through trials and sufferings which have been shared together. It is the separation of two hearts which have become more and more strongly cemented, as they have been more perfectly understood. It is the separation of hearts that have joyed and wept in unison through all their varied experiences of joy, grief, privation, and wretchedness; and let not my practical reader smile, that Mr. and Mrs. Grattan should indulge in tears at such a separation, forced upon them by dire necessity, and from which neither dare to hope for good. It is the poor man's last appeal to the justice of a hard and unjust world, and both husband and wife feel that such is the case; it is a last effort to secure a reward to just and sterling desert, from a world that has no sympathy with that which is most beautiful and pure in human nature, while it is ever ready to lavish its favors upon the gross, the vulgar, the sinful. Under these circumstances, how cold, comfortless, and cheerless to those two hearts must be the bleak future into which they are looking, and upon which their past experiences can throw no ray of light.</p>
               <p>What passed between Mr. and Mrs. Grattan we can not say; but when the coach rattled up to the little gate in front of the house, and he came out, there was a haggard wildness in his look, accompanied with such an expression of despair as would have moved the most callous soul. It spoke not only of known sorrows, wrongs, and griefs, but of agony concealed even from those he most loved.</p>
               <p>My practical reader, who is not expected to reason or understand the impulses of the artist, will excuse me if I pause here a moment to answer some of his objections to what he may call an overdrawn description of the sorrows and grief of poor Grattan. Pardon me, sir, if I put a question into your mouth which has been rung so often in the ear of every artist in the country that it will look to them like an old acquaintance—"Why don't he go to work and better his condition? He is an able-bodied man, with intellect enough to succeed, and why does he continue to endure such wrongs? Why does he not do as others do?"</p>
               <p>Why, sir, don't you go to painting, or writing poetry? Why do you stand behind your counter or in your shop, dealing out your wares to customers for your cent. per cent. profit? Why do you wear out both soul and body in your efforts to amass wealth, which neither your wasted physical powers or perverted intellect will last long enough to enjoy.</p>
               <p>I will tell you the reason in few words why you both act as you do, and why each thinks the other (with some justice, perhaps) a fool. You and Grattan are by nature differently constituted. He has a soul which yearns for communion with that which is beautiful and elevating, and you are simply living to fill your purse, that you may strut before your fellows as a man of wealth. He is a man of refinement, and a moral man in the true sense of the word. He will not come to you like a common beggar to parade his sorrows and receive your stinted charities, even though his sufferings may be far greater than those of the street beggar. A phrenologist with his eyes shut, would tell you at once he could not succeed as a business man.</p>
               <p>Men do not ordinarily suffer wrong and injustice from the "love of the thing," and it is but just to allow that those who adhere so tenaciously to thankless and profitless pursuits (in the <emph>practical</emph> sense) are influenced by some power which they can not resist. The difficulty, sir, is, that there is no charity or sympathy between the practical and the ideal. Go and set the example yourself! If you have an artist in your neighborhood, commission him immediately for some of his works—not as an act of charity—not to save him from starving—but as an act of <emph>justice</emph>—and if you have no refined feeling yourself, introduce them into your family, hang them upon your walls, and let their pure influence save its members from becoming as heartless as you are.</p>
               <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6567-00000054"/>
               <p>Whatever may be your opinion, or however little weight you attach to these remarks, it is quite certain that Mr. Grattan <emph>did</emph> come forth from his interview with his wife in the manner stated; and I have no doubt, if his thoughts could be analyzed, the dread of the renewed struggle with just such opinions as you entertain, had much to do with this marked exhibition of grief. The daughter, as he came forward toward the little grief-stricken group, sprang forward to meet him, and throwing her arms around his neck, buried her face in his bosom, and gave herself up to her grief, while a son clung to either hand no less agitated—an outburst of feeling called for, not so much by the circumstance that their father was leaving home, as by the haggard and careworn countenance of that father.</p>
               <p>It was too much for Hugo, and taking up Mr. Grattan's little trunk, he hurried down to the gate, and busied himself in adjusting it in its place in the rumble, while Mr. Grattan was parting from his weeping children.</p>
               <p>He soon made his appearance, and walking down to the gate, extended his hand to Hugo, and wringing it convulsively, said:</p>
               <p>"Good-bye, Hugo; do your best to cheer Kate and the children."</p>
               <p>"I will, Mr. Grattan, while I remain here; but you need not be surprised to see me in New York before many months roll round."</p>
               <p>"To repent the step at your leisure. Good-bye, Hugo"—and kissing his hand to the little group at the door, he got in, Hugo closing the door after him, and the coach rolled away.</p>
               <p>Hugo gazed after it as it rattled on, leaving a cloud of dust behind, through which its clumsy form was dimly seen swinging to and fro; and when it disappeared at a turn of the adjoining wood, he looked toward the house, and seeing that the door was closed, and none of the family remaining in sight, he determined not to intrude upon their grief, and turned his steps homeward.</p>
               <p>As he turned from the gate, he was attracted by the noise of wheels approaching in the direction of the town, and looking around he saw seated in a buggy, driving furiously toward him, Mr. Burton and the village constable; and curious to know what could be <emph>their</emph> errand, he paused and watched their approach with no little interest. As soon as Mr. Burton saw him, he hailed him; and driving up to where he stood, they both jumped out into the road, and Mr. Burton, in a voice of excitement, asked:</p>
               <p>"Has Mr. Grattan gone?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," Hugo replied, "in the coach, a few moments since."</p>
               <p>"Get in, then, Wapping," Burton continued, hurrying up to the buggy again; "we can overtake them yet, perhaps."</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, Mr. Burton?" Hugo asked, stopping him; "what do you want with Mr. Grattan?"</p>
               <p>"Why," said the little man, as if he was the most wronged and injured man in the world, "he has left an unsettled account on my books, and the first thing <emph>we</emph> know, his family will be off, and we shall get nothing for it. Get in, Wapping," he added, impatiently.</p>
               <p>"Stop a moment, Mr. Burton," Hugo said, anxiously; "what are you going to do?"</p>
               <p>"Why," cried Mr. Burton, evidently surprised at the question, "make him pay the account, or bring him back. Come, Wapping, we have no time to talk."</p>
               <p>"Hold a minute, Mr. Burton," said Hugo, thoughtfully; "what is the amount of your bill?"</p>
               <p>"Twenty dollars."</p>
               <p>"Is that all?" Hugo asked, with ill-concealed indignation.</p>
               <p>"All!" exclaimed Burton; "that's enough to lose by such a vagabond; he has promised me to pay it long ago."</p>
               <p>"And would have done it, Mr. Burton," Hugo replied, "if he had been able to do so."</p>
               <p>"Able to do so!" Burton indignantly exclaimed; "where did he get his money to run away on? If he has money for that purpose, he can pay me."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Burton," Hugo answered angrily, walking up to him<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6567-00000055"/> with a flushed countenance, "you are a villain to use such language in regard to Mr. Grattan, when you know, or ought to know, that he is perfectly honest—more so than you ever were," he added, shaking his clenched fist at the trembling little scoundrel.</p>
               <p>"Wapping! you will witness that this is, in the eye of the law, an assault. I do not wish to have a violent altercation with the young man, and we will go on, if you please."</p>
               <p>"Stop a moment," Hugo urged again. "I will stand good for the amount of your claim against Grattan, if you will return to town."</p>
               <p>"You!" Mr. Burton asked, looking at him doubtfully. "That might do if your father would sign a note with you for the amount. But <emph>how</emph> are <emph>you</emph> to pay it?"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Burton," Hugo persisted, stepping up to the side of the buggy carelessly, and taking the whip from the seat, which he playfully snapped against the ground—"Mr. Burton, I pledge myself to pay this account on Saturday—will that answer your purpose?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir," Burton replied, "not without security."</p>
               <p>"Very well," said Hugo, springing lightly into the buggy, "I will go to town and get the security, and by the time you return, will have it all arranged;" and before they could recover themselves, the horse's head was turned again toward town, and he was flying in that direction under vigorous applications of the whip, leaving Burton and the constable to find their way back at leisure.</p>
               <p>Arrived in the village, he drove up to the store of Mr. Burton, and jumping out, fastened the reins to the post, and hurried as fast as possible to the office of Dr. Draper, which was only a few doors distant, and entering hurriedly, fortunately found him there.</p>
               <p>"Why!" the Doctor exclaimed, with a start, at his sudden entrance. "Hugo, what's the matter? anybody sick at the house?"</p>
               <p>"No, Doctor," Hugo hurriedly replied; "quite a different thing. I have come to ask a favor of you."</p>
               <p>"Well, Hugo, what is it?" the Doctor asked, laying down his book and rising to his feet.</p>
               <p>Hugo gave him a full account of his interview with Burton, and its termination, asking his assistance to meet Burton's claim. When he had concluded, the Doctor was convulsed with laughter, which only subsided one moment to burst out again the next with increased violence.</p>
               <p>"The rascal!" he exclaimed, as soon as he could speak, and wiping the tears from his eyes; "you served him right. What could he expect to gain by bringing poor Grattan back here?"—and here he laughed again, as he thought of Hugo's successful plan to prevent such an outrage. "You served him right, Hugo; the villain! but why didn't Grattan tell me of this himself?"</p>
               <p>"I suppose, Doctor, he felt a delicacy in doing so."</p>
               <p>"Very well; we will make it all right, now. Come along, Hugo," he said, taking up his hat and cane; "Burton will be back by the time we get there;" and laughing as he went, he hurried out, followed by Hugo, and hastened to Mr. Burton's store.</p>
               <p>The two discomfited worthies had not yet arrived, and Hugo and the Doctor walked back into the counting-room to wait for them, the former under the keen scrutinizing eyes of his old companions, Smith and Lankton, who, though keeping at a respectful distance, looked unutterable things at him as he passed on.</p>
               <p>Burton and the constable soon arrived, full of excitement and indignation; and learning from Smith and Lankton that Hugo and Dr. Draper were in the counting-room, Burton and his companion joined them there, and the former, swelling with excitement when his eye fell on Hugo, cried out—</p>
               <p>"I will have you arrested, you young rascal; such a highhanded outrage I never heard of! Doctor, would you believe it?"</p>
               <p>"I have heard it all, Mr. Burton," the Doctor said, interrupting him, "and we have come here to arrange matters without any further difficulty, if possible."</p>
               <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6567-00000056"/>
               <p>"Do <emph>you</emph> countenance him, then," Burton asked, pointing at Hugo, "in such outrages, the little villain?" he added, forgetting for the time his usual caution.</p>
               <p>"That will do, Mr. Burton," and Hugo advanced toward him with looks that boded him no good, while Burton retreated behind Wapping. "That will do, sir; I will submit to no such language."</p>
               <p>"Wapping," cried Burton, excessively alarmed, "you will observe this is in my own store!"</p>
               <p>"Come, Burton," said the Doctor, bluntly, "don't make a fool of yourself any further. I suppose your principal object is to secure the amount due from Grattan, and if you will give me your bill receipted, I will pay it."</p>
               <p>At this, Burton, keeping one eye on Hugo, and evidently not relishing the Doctor's language, came forward to the desk and made out the bill in due form, gave it to the Doctor, and received the money; after which he remarked that he would take another occasion to punish Hugo. He would have him arrested for resisting an officer.</p>
               <p>"Come, come, Burton, you're a fool; don't irritate the boy any further."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Doctor," said Hugo, "he is welcome to proceed in any way he chooses against me; I shall not take the coach and run away."</p>
               <p>Burton, too cowardly to make any reply, and too angry to be quiet, gave expression to his feelings by walking up and down the floor, puffing like a porpoise, and muttering something about an arrest, while the Doctor took Hugo by the arm and led him out.</p>
               <p>It is enough to know that Burton, from motives of his own, never carried his threat into execution.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
               <head type="sub">A CRISIS—AN EXCITING INTERVIEW—HUGO'S DETERMINATION.</head>
               <p>THE reader will allow us the privilege, in these pages, of going back or forward and introducing our characters at such times and places as are best suited, in our opinion, to the interest of our story. We will accordingly pass over the period of six weeks after the departure of Mr. Grattan, with all its trials, vexations, and annoyances, and take up those incidents which bear more particularly upon the fate of Hugo Blanc, reserving for future chapters the task of filling up this gap by a detail of those connected with others in whom we have taken an interest.</p>
               <p>Hugo has just returned to his father's house after a day's sketching, and, having reached his little room in his usual cautious manner, is, at the time we again introduce him, sitting opposite a chair upon which is resting a tinted sketch. He is in that kind of dreamy mood with which artists are familiar, examining its faults and beauties with a critical eye by the fading twilight, and indulging such hopes and fancies as artists are wont to indulge when their fine feelings and fresh imaginings are not crossed by the vexations and annoyances which too frequently obtrude themselves, calling them from fancies to the realization of facts. Hugo, as will be seen, was no exception to the rule, although his circumstances, or, rather, the circumstances of his father, might have reasonably led us to hope for better things. His fancies were also followed by facts; and although he had been living for months in fear of that time when his father should again<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6567-00000057"/> arouse himself from his apparent indifference in regard to his pursuits, he had been now so long unmolested and unquestioned, that he began to hope that his father was giving tacit consent to his wishes, and would throw no serious obstacles in his way, even if he did not give him any direct and unqualified encouragement. But Mr. Blanc, whatever might be the outward seeming, was a man of iron will, and when once his mind was made up, he was not to be moved from his purposes by any circumstances, unless he found them insurmountable. He never dreamed of serious opposition to his wishes on the part of any member of his family; and if he had been apparently careless in regard to Hugo's habits since he left the employment of Mr. Burton, it grew out of this feeling; and he rested in perfect security upon the conviction that Hugo would do just as he wished, without other opposition than the innate dislike to business confinement which is common in youth. Mr. Blanc and Hugo, as we have before hinted, were both mistaken, as the sequel will show.</p>
               <p>A light step at his door aroused Hugo from his reflections, and he turned toward it with the expectation of seeing Louise enter, as was her custom at the close of the day, when he returned from his rambles; but when the door opened, he saw instead of his sister, his mother, who approached him with an uneasy expression in her face, and stooping over his shoulder, kissed him affectionately without saying a word. Taking her lovingly by the hand, and evidently feeling that she would appreciate the beauty of the little sketch he had brought home with him, he asked how she liked it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Blanc only shook her head despondingly, and Hugo inquired more eagerly—</p>
               <p>"Don't you know the place, mother?" And after a pause, as she made no reply, he continued, with some vexation in his manner: "Why, don't you know that group of trees, and this old moss-covered rock, with its base resting in the water, and that island out there in the lake, and the mountains beyond? Curious, mother!" he continued; "you have been there a thousand times."</p>
               <p>"Hugo," said Mrs. Blanc, tenderly, "I know the place well; but I have come here to communicate something to you that will make you very unhappy again, and I am in no mood to enjoy the sketch."</p>
               <p>"Why," Hugo asked, turning around with an expression of surprise and alarm, "what is the matter now, mother?"</p>
               <p>"My son, your father has this day determined that you shall go into a store again; and," she continued kindly, "my dear son, it is, perhaps, better for us all that you submit to his wishes, and think no more of this," and she pointed sadly at the picture.</p>
               <p>"Oh, mother!" Hugo exclaimed, rising to his feet, pale as death, "is this true?"</p>
               <p>"It <emph>is</emph> true, Hugo," she answered. "Mr. Carter came home with your father to-day about eleven o'clock, and remained to dinner. They were in the library together from that time until dinner was ready, and when they came to the table, your father mentioned to me during the conversation which there took place, that he had been making arrangements with him to take you into his store next week."</p>
               <p>"Mother!" Hugo exclaimed, vehemently, "I will not go; Carter is no better than Burton, and if he were, I would not go; I will not be a merchant."</p>
               <p>"Stop, my son," said Mrs. Blanc, gently, laying her hand upon his arm; "do not resolve upon anything until I tell you all, and you know the alternative. After dinner was over, and Mr. Carter gone, your father came up here to see if you were yet returned, and seeing your drawing materials and a few recent sketches lying upon your table, he was very much enraged; I have never seen him so angry. He tore your drawings to pieces, and threw your pencils, India ink, porcelain cups, and sepia, out of the window, and coming down stairs, told me what he had done; censured me severely for permitting you in his absence to do that which he had discountenanced; and, finally, my dear son, told me to tell you, when you came home, that he expected you to meet him in the library this evening prepared to submit to his wishes, or<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6567-00000058"/> go out upon the world, and try to live by that which he insists will never afford even a bare subsistence."</p>
               <p>Hugo, who had bent his head forward upon his breast during the delivery of this sentence, raised it when she had concluded, and looking into her face, as if doubtful of what he heard, exclaimed, "Did he say this, mother? Can he be so determined?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Hugo, these were his very words; and I am satisfied that he will not abate one jot of his determination. Now, is it not better, after all, my dear boy, that you submit? Can you not forego these tastes? Can you not sacrifice a little of your own happiness for your father's—for ours?" she concluded, impressively.</p>
               <p>"A little, mother!" he exclaimed. "It is not a little—it is <emph>all!</emph> it is sacrificing everything; ought he to ask me to do this? am I to live in this world for my <emph>own</emph> happiness, or am I only a money-making machine, to be driven like a locomotive, at the will of a master—or father, if you choose—against every impulse of my own nature?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Blanc was staggered at these questions, as they presented to her two views of the subject, and she paused some time before she answered:</p>
               <p>"These are sad questions, Hugo, and I feel unhappy that your situation should <emph>seem</emph> to justify them; but while you are under your father's control, <emph>at least,</emph>" she said, emphasizing the last two words strongly, "would it not be best to submit?"</p>
               <p>"No, mother! no! By the time I am of age, these pure feelings and aspirations will have gone forever, in this miserable employment, and there will be nothing left but <emph>darkness.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Well, my son," said Mrs. Blanc, sorrowfully, "there is no alternative; we <emph>must</emph> submit, let the justice of the question be where it may; and if we can not do as we would, we must do as we can, until we find circumstances more favorable. You will think the matter over, and act, I feel sure, as your father wishes."</p>
               <p>"The crisis has come," he replied, with melancholy thoughtfulness fulness, and speaking in a low voice, which seemed rather an audible utterance of his thoughts than words addressed to his mother—"the crisis has come, but I shall never go into Carter's store. I will see father, as he requests, and if he will not consent to regard my wishes, I will—"</p>
               <p>"Will what, Hugo?" Mrs. Blanc exclaimed, starting forward and clasping her hands. "Don't, my dear boy, make any rash resolves. Don't break our hearts by willfulness."</p>
               <p>"Mother," Hugo answered, sorrowfully, "how much I love you no one knows but myself, and I would do nothing or say anything to grieve you, if I could avoid it; but I will never go into a store again." He paused here, and looking at his mother, who had turned away as he proceeded, asked, "Will father insist on my obedience in this matter?"</p>
               <p>"He will, most assuredly," Mrs. Blanc replied, turning and looking at him tenderly; "and what will you gain by disobedience, except misery and unhappiness?"</p>
               <p>"What will I gain but misery and unhappiness if I obey, mother? Will it not be a repetition of the same old scenes that occurred at Burton's? Shall I not every day long for my brushes and colors and the free mountain air? Shall I not inwardly curse, day by day, my miserable fate, and shall I not," he added, pressing her hands affectionately, "wish myself dead a thousand times before a year is over?" Mrs. Blanc placed her hands over her face and trembled violently, as he added: "No! no! mother—it will be a living death."</p>
               <p>"Only think <emph>well,</emph> Hugo," the mother said, pleadingly; "do nothing rashly. Let reason rather than impulse guide you, my son, and above all, avoid saying anything to your father, when you see him, to irritate him. You may," she added, although the expression of her countenance did not exhibit full faith in the hope expressed in the words—"you may per suade him that it is best to aid you in your art, and if so, we shall all be happy. At all events, Hugo, we must in this life bend to circumstances."</p>
               <p>With these words she left him, and little dreamed as she<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6567-00000059"/> uttered them how firmly her son was determined in his own course.</p>
               <p>For some time after the door had closed behind his mother, he sat gazing through the small aperture at the top of his darkened window, and upon his beautiful features were stamped a thousand emotions, while the convulsive clutching of his hand told a tale of mental strife too great for one of his years. The parted lip and distended nostril, the bright fire which burned in his clear, dark eye, spoke volumes of high hopes and ambitious dreams; and the occasional shadow which passed over his features also indicated that these hopes were now suddenly converted into doubts and fears. There was no wavering or hesitancy, however, in his manner, and those doubts and fears looked rather to the future than the present—to the struggles with the world which were before him, and the trials and sorrows of which he could, of course, know nothing. His present course was determined upon.</p>
               <p>The happiness growing out of the successful practice of a beautiful art—high aims and brilliant anticipations operating upon an active and energetic temperament, somewhat tinged with his father's strong self-will—decided him to adhere to the profession he had chosen, even at the hazard of being driven from his home under the displeasure of his father.</p>
               <p>Such a resolution naturally aroused a tempest of emotions in his heart. He must announce it to his father, whose sternness was a terror to him, and whose biting sarcasms he could scarcely endure, and he must meet his loved and loving mother to say those heart-rending words, Farewell, mother!—words filled with volumes of doubt, fears, anxieties for the future, and the bitter and overpowering reflection that possibly these words were uttered for the last time. That gentle being might never see him again—might never again imprint upon his forehead the maternal kiss, moved by an impulse of the holiest affection for her only son. He must embrace for perhaps the last time his constant and loving companion, his mild and gentle sister, whose nature was all affection, and who lavished this affection upon her brother. This last interview he contemplated with agony. The very thought of a separation from one who had been his only confidant, into whose ear he had poured all his griefs and disappointments, and who had ever entered warmly and enthusiastically into all his plans, hopes, and fears—who was bound to him by stronger ties of sympathy and affection than even his idolized mother—enhanced his sufferings four-fold, and went far to shake his determination. In the quiet of his little room he now tried to arm himself for these interviews, and finally reached the determination to brave everything, and separate from those he held so dear, rather than eternally toil and drudge in any pursuit which would yield him nothing of enjoyment—which would give no play to his fine imagination, or gratify that innate something which whispered that he was born for better things.</p>
               <p>His resolution once formed, his impetuous nature impelled him to seek at once the interview which his father desired, and learn from his own lips whether he determined to adhere to the resolution expressed to his mother. He accordingly rose hastily from his seat, and descending the stairs rapidly, but firmly, rapped gently at the door of his father's library. The stern "Come in!" which answered his summons, caused his heart to sink within him, and for a moment checked its rapid and excited beatings. A shuddering sensation ran through his frame, but this soon passed away, and with a hasty effort he opened the door and stood, downcast, fearful, and uncertain, in the presence of his father.</p>
               <p>For a brief space not a word was spoken; but the father bent upon him his cold eye, and seemed to read in the manner of his son the nature of his resolution; and the conviction that it was averse to his wishes, exhibited itself upon his countenance in an aggravation of his usual stern expression. Bending his eye in a withering glance upon him, as if enjoying his embarrassment, he sat sufficiently long for the silence to produce its effect upon the boy, and then in his severest manner said—</p>
               <pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6567-00000060"/>
               <p>"I suppose, sir, you have come, agreeably to my commands, sent by your mother, to give me your decision in regard to the acceptance of this new situation I have secured for you; and I am informed in advance, by your manner, that my determination is likely to have but little influence in weaning you from your insanity. Am I right?"</p>
               <p>"Father," said Hugo, "you are right; but let me assure you I have not concluded to brave your displeasure thoughtlessly. I have come to tell you that I can not do as you desire without commencing a warfare against feelings and impulses which are a part of my life."</p>
               <p>He paused here, while the glance from his father's eye made him shrink within himself—a glance compounded of indignation and astonishment. Paralyzed for a moment at his son's firmness, his utterance was choked; but soon recovering himself, he rose with a start from his seat, and striding rapidly up to him, shook his clenched fist above his head, and exclaimed, with a burst of passion—</p>
               <p>"Fool! fool! and is it for this that you have been educated? Am I to see all my plans frustrated by a foolish passion which has entered your head, Heaven only knows how? Look around you upon those who are spending their lives in this manner! what are they? Beggars! beggars! and you are ambitious to swell their numbers by adding your name to the list."</p>
               <p>"But can I help it, father, even if what you say is true? What I do I can not avoid, and if it does not bring me wealth, it will at least make me happy; and it will be a happiness which a world of wealth can not buy."</p>
               <p>"And while you are spending your time in the pursuit of happiness, where is your bread-and-butter to come from?" said his father, with a sneer.</p>
               <p>"My dear father, I have ventured to hope that you would, when I made you acquainted with my strong predilection for Art, give me such aid in securing advantages as your means would allow, and no longer press upon me that which is so distasteful. Should you feel disposed to do so, I have no fear about being able to place myself in a position to provide for myself."</p>
               <p>"Not a doit—not a doit," his father exclaimed, stamping with rage. "Not one doit shall you have from me to assist you in making a pauper of yourself. I have humored you in your wish to quit the service of Mr. Burton, in full confidence that when I should find a better place for you, you would willingly enter upon those duties which can alone make a useful man of you. To-day I have found, to my indignation and astonishment, that you have been, during the whole time that you have been at home, adhering to your sketching and daubing, contrary to my known wishes; and if you are inclined to try <emph>their</emph> availability, you can do so; you get no aid from me."</p>
               <p>At this stunning denial, Hugo covered his face with his hands and wept, while his father stood coldly looking on, unmoved by his grief, and evincing no disposition to relent. Thus they stood for some moments, until the father, becoming more and more impatient, asked—</p>
               <p>"Am I to understand from all this that you are determined to disregard my wishes?"</p>
               <p>"Father," the boy plead, looking up with streaming eyes, "I would rather be a poor artist, happy, than a rich merchant, miserable. I can not endure a repetition of what I suffered at Mr. Burton's. I know it will be no better at Carter's. If I consented to go there, the moment I was of age I would return to my art; and, father, what would be gained by these two or three years' martyrdom?"</p>
               <p>"Enough! enough!" Mr. Blanc exclaimed, violently. "If this is your resolve, I am none the less resolved that your folly shall receive no encouragement beneath this roof; and you will have to seek other scenes and other friends than you will find here."</p>
               <p>"Oh, father! do not use such harsh language, and forbear to utter words for which I know you will repent a thousand times. I am not self-willed, as you think me; I am not stubborn. If you knew how I have struggled with myself to gratify you, you would not speak to me in this manner. If<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC6567-00000061"/> you knew the process by which honesty is slowly but surely replaced by loose notions upon this subject, and many times by undisguised <emph>dishonesty</emph>—in the employment in which you would have me again engage—you would not ask it of me. Father!" he continued, with a burst of feeling, "I can not endure it. I would love you—I would obey you—I would make any sacrifice for your happiness—but the God of nature is the author of my impulses; the God of nature has stamped my character, and I feel that I must obey these impulses or lead a miserable life. Oh! you do not know what a dread I have of this pursuit, and how my heart sinks at the bare idea of the misery it would entail upon me again."</p>
               <p>Mr. Blanc listened to this passionate ebullition, and made no effort to speak until Hugo had paused from over-excited feeling, and burst a second time into tears. He then said to him, with a slow and deliberate utterance, that every word might have its full effect:</p>
               <p>"The worthless and lazy have a natural antipathy to pursuits which involve exertion, and it is but natural that <emph>you</emph> should indulge these feelings. You need not, however, expect to arouse my sympathies by your fine-spun theories about honor and honesty. You are too nice in your notions upon this subject, and it is for the very purpose of making you more practical that I have urged you to take this new situation, and I will waste no time here to shake your valiant resolution; I merely repeat to you what I said to your mother—drive this nonsense from your head, or throw yourself upon the mercy of that Providence who, you so pathetically say, has stamped your character, and learn at your leisure the extent of your folly."</p>
               <p>"Father! father! this is too bitter—<emph>too</emph> galling! I have not deserved this; but I shall still adhere to my resolve, uttering no reproaches upon you for your determination to drive me from your roof. Do not speak again, father," he said, as he saw him about to address him; "I would not have you say that which may cause you much sorrow hereafter. If you are determined to insist that I go into Mr. Carter's store, I must disrespect your wishes, and to-morrow's sun will find me no longer an incumbrance to you, for I shall be far from here. I shall say no bitter things at parting, as I would wish ever to <emph>deserve</emph> your kindliest sympathies if I do not receive them. I will make the effort to sustain myself by my art; if I fail of success, this is probably our last interview; and I give you the assurance now, that the affection that I feel for you and the loved ones I leave behind will burn brightly whereever I may be."</p>
               <p>To this the father made no reply. Whether his feelings were touched by the noble bearing of his son, and he did not like to trust himself to speak, for fear of betraying any tender emotions in his manner, we leave the reader to judge. He waved his hand in a determined manner toward the door, and in another moment the son stood alone in the silent hall. They had parted—father and son!</p>

               <head type="sub">PREPARATIONS FOR DEPARTURE—TIES TO BE SUNDERED—WATCHING FROM THE WINDOWS.</head>
               <p>HUGO paused and looked about him with a bewildered air for a moment; then, as the scene just passed and its consequences rushed through his mind, he pressed his hands to his forehead, and the agitation of his frame plainly indicated the struggle going on within. Not a sob or a sigh broke the stillness around him; but the tears which stole one by one through the hands which were pressed to his brow, and drop by drop reached the floor at his feet, were the silent evidences of the depth of his grief; and as he dwelt upon the approaching separation from his mother and sister, these drops increased, and he staggered to the foot of the staircase, where he threw himself upon the steps and gave way to a burst of passionate grief. Rising at length, he ascended to his room, there to commune with himself, and prepare for his departure; and throwing himself upon a chair, he sat for some moments to collect his scattered faculties. At length, drawing near to a table, he took from the drawer a bit of paper, and with a pencil wrote the following note:</p>
               <q>

                           <p>"DEAR MARY—I shall pass to-night, at twelve o'clock, the little gate back of your mother's cottage. May I hope that, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour, I shall meet you there? The storm I told you I anticipated is past, and I am henceforth an exile from my father's house. I can not leave home and friends, and turn my back upon loved scenes, without out an interview with you, and I feel in my heart that you will not disappoint me. When we meet, I will tell you all my plans. Till then, farewell.</p>

                           <p>"DEAR MOTHER AND SISTER—When you receive this, I shall no longer be an inmate of this house, but shall have placed many weary and desolate miles between you and your much loved son and brother. I have had an interview with father, at which he reiterated his immovable determination to adhere to the threats expressed to you, mother, this morning, and I am banished from the parental roof for indulging those feelings and impulses which I find irresistible. I could not trust myself to meet you, to say farewell (God knows for how long!), but have rather chosen this method of parting, as the best under the circumstances. The anguish I feel at this separation almost overcomes my resolution, but, dear mother and sweet sister, I am somewhat consoled by the conviction that our separation will not be for long. I feel that there is that within me which must soon place me in a situation where my father's prejudices will no longer operate against the profession I have adopted. I shall keep you informed of all that will be interesting to you in my career, and if it is successful, my father's objections will be removed. If I fail, there will be two hearts that will not censure the step I have taken, and will sympathize to the fullest in my disappointment. My father can not know what an over-gushing fountain of veneration and love he has choked up. But I love him still, and, mother, he <emph>shall</emph> love his son; and that son, who now leaves his father's roof in the dead of night—alone—an exile—fondly looks forward to the day when father, mother, and sister will receive him back again with joyful hearts and outstretched arms. Mother—sister—farewell.</p>

               <p>Having folded this epistle, he placed it upon the table, and walking to the window, gazed out upon the scene which spread itself beneath. The house was situated upon the slope of a mountain which rose high up behind it, and whose topmost crags seemed to threaten its destruction. In front, in the distance, rose two majestic mountain-peaks, whose summits just at this moment were gorgeously lit up by the declining sun, and were surrounded by a wreath of clouds which reflected their splendid hues of orange and gold upon the surrounding landscape. Slumbering among these hills was the quiet lake, whose bosom mirrored the beautiful colors of cloud, mountain, and sky, giving an inverted picture of the magnificent scene above. Between the house and the lake lay a gentle, undulating slope, terminated by a dense forest of chestnut trees, which ran down to its shores. Immediately in front of the house was a beautifully cultivated garden and lawn, with here and there one of the ancient forest trees, left standing in all its primeval glory. A few rods from the house the garden was shut in by a substantial stone wall, through which the grounds were entered by a gate which opened upon the public road. At the distance of about a mile reposed the little village, whose single church spire was almost obscured by the smoke of many chimneys, hanging like a vail over it, and giving an air of quietness and repose to the whole scene. Nearer the house, and between it and the village, stood the neat little cottage of Mr. Grattan, whose whitewashed sides were turned to gold by the evening sun. The gaze of our hero was intently riveted upon this spot—and who shall fathom the emotions that agitated his heart as his eye dwelt upon the roof which sheltered her whom we have seen him address as "dear Mary," and from whom he had begged an interview that night, and whose loved countenance might never beam upon him again? He strained his eyes to see if he could not catch a glimpse of her form, either in the little yard or at her window, which fronted his own, but in vain.</p>
               <p>How often had he sat here before and gazed upon that window, wondering whether she were not also looking upon his, and asking herself similar questions to those which he propounded to his own heart! This evening these feelings were aggravated by the contemplation of the many vicissitudes and trials through which he must pass before her sweet smile would welcome him home again, and he asked himself a thousand unanswerable questions in regard to her. Did she feel the same kind of attachment for him that he entertained for her? Could she fully appreciate the nature of that affection which would endure for life, or was her attachment only of that commonplace character which would naturally grow out of their every-day intercourse, and be forgotten so soon as time and absence had obliterated his image from her mind? This night he proposed to solve these internal questions, and, however much he dreaded to leave his home, he still looked forward to no slight compensation for all his sacrifices in the eternal affection which he felt certain would be pledged to him by her own lips, at this melancholy and singular parting.</p>
               <p>While thus leaning from the window, absorbed in these reflections, he was startled from his revery by the closing of the gate at the foot of the lawn, and, turning his eyes in that direction, he beheld his sister with a basket of spring flowers, just parting from Mary Grattan, who stood upon the opposite side of the gate. The two girls discovered him at the same moment, and the salute which each gave him by gracefully kissing the hand, with a gesture toward the window where he sat, added fresh fuel to the painful reflections which agitated him, and it required all his fortitude and self-command to return it with the same ease and grace which were usual to him upon similar occasions.</p>
               <p>The two girls parted; and he watched the graceful form of Mary with straining eyes and painful emotions, until it disappeared among the dense foliage we have spoken of at the foot of the slope, in the direction of her home.</p>
               <p>His sister, with her basket of flowers in one hand and her pretty little hat twirling upon the fingers of the other,<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6567-00000064"/> came bounding up the walk, her fresh and beautiful countenance glowing with health and happiness, until immediately under the window where her brother sat, when she paused, and, looking up with a face beaming with affection, exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Brother Hugo, what are you doing there, moping so stupidly out of the window this fine evening? Here Mary and I have been tramping through the woods for miles, hunting for you, and expecting to find you somewhere on our way, pensively studying the beauties of some old dock-weed or mullein stalk, and carefully conveying their forms to your sketch-book. Oh, such a glorious sunset as we have had—you have missed a sight which may never occur again."</p>
               <p>Here she paused, out of breath, and, looking fixedly up into her brother's face, which was turned toward her with an expression of deep sadness, she suddenly exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Hugo, are you not well, that you look so pale and downcast? See here, my dear brother, what a nice bouquet of flowers I have brought to adorn your table in the morning! These," she said, holding up some beautiful wild violets and Indian pinks, "Mary told me to present to you, <emph>from her.</emph> Will they not chase away the gloom which sits so ungracefully upon your brow?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, Louise," he said, with an effort; "bring them up, and I will place them next my heart."</p>
               <p>"Oh," said she, with a merry laugh, "are you roused at last? But I <emph>must</emph> come up and tell you what curious things we have talked about, and I know I shall make you smile again in spite of yourself."</p>
               <p>So saying, she turned hastily to enter the house, while her brother, rising from his seat, hurried to the table, and taking up the two notes, deposited one of them in the drawer, and returning to the window with the other, called to the gardener, who stood near the house, and throwing it down to him, directed him to go with it immediately to the cottage of Mrs. Grattan, and deliver it into the hands of Mary herself. The man took up the note and departed, and the youth turned from the window with a forced composure to meet his sister, who came bounding into the room, and ran up close to where he stood, when she suddenly stopped, gazed earnestly and inquiringly into the troubled face of her brother for a moment, then bounded forward again, and throwing her arms around his neck, exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Hugo, my dear brother, what has happened, that you look so sorrowful and wretched? Has father been here?" she asked, shudderingly looking up into his face.</p>
               <p>"No, no, Louise. Father has not been here at all. I have only been indulging a little melancholy reflection, which will be soon chased away by the account you are to give me of your late ramble in the woods with Mary."</p>
               <p>"Poor Hugo! you are so unhappy that you can not draw and paint without this secrecy," she said, looking around the room, "and I know that you are every day afraid that father will find it out—that's it, isn't it, Hugo?"</p>
               <p>"Never mind that, Louise," he replied, with a forced smile; "tell me about your ramble with Mary."</p>
               <p>"Ah, yes," said his sister—"with Mary. I suppose my story would lose half its interest, did not the name of Mary occur so frequently during its recital. But you shall hear enough of it to satisfy you, I assure you. Why, we did not pass an old moss-covered log, or gray old rock, or a wild patch of herbage and grass, but she would exclaim, 'Oh, what a beautiful study for Hugo!' or, 'How I do wish Hugo were here to see this!' and so on, until we came down upon the margin of the lake near Mr. Grey's fishing-hut, when the beauty of the scene seemed quite to carry her away, and she cried over and over again, 'What <emph>would</emph> I give, if Hugo were here to sketch this <emph>for me</emph> just as it appears now!' Ah! Hugo," she added, after a pause, "I do believe that girl loves you better than she does me, and I sometimes believe better than she does any living creature."</p>
               <p>Pausing again, she looked into the face of her brother, who had made no remark as she proceeded, and beheld, to her astonishment, his face averted, while the tears were slowly<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6567-00000065"/> coursing down his cheek, and his breast heaving with internal emotion.</p>
               <p>Stepping back and holding him at arm's length, she looked into his face with a mixed expression of wonder and sympathy, while tears, called up by his apparent suffering, also filled her own eyes. Thus the two stood for a few moments, unable to utter a word, although the emotions which influenced them were widely different. He wept from a thousand feelings which his sister's simple story had called up—and she, because she felt a world of sympathy for her brother, let the cause of his grief be what it might. In this silent interchange of feeling they stood for some moments, neither speaking a word, and the little room grew darker and darker, as the sun sank lower and lower in the west. At length, Hugo drew his sister gently to his side, and, placing his arm around her delicate form, said to her—</p>
               <p>"Louise, you do not know what a world of happiness your little story has opened up for your poor brother, and how often it will be a consolation and a stimulus to exertion hereafter."</p>
               <p>"Poor brother! stimulus to exertion hereafter!" she said, slowly repeating his words. "Brother Hugo, what <emph>has</emph> happened? What <emph>do</emph> you mean by these strange words and stranger manner? I <emph>must</emph> know, and you are cruel to keep one who loves you so much, in ignorance of the cause of this grief."</p>
               <p>"Sister, do not let us talk any more at present upon this subject. I will acknowledge that there is a good cause for my unhappiness, and that I am very miserable; but I can tell you nothing to-night. In the morning you shall know all—everything," said he, in a very sad tone. "I promise you, Louise, everything. Leave me now to 'nurse the blues' in my own way. Saying this, he led her to the door, and, pressing her to his heart, imprinted a convulsive kiss upon her fair brow, and pushing her gently from the room, closed the door and returned to the table. Little did the poor girl suspect, as she stood for a few moments outside her brother's door, weeping and wondering at his strange conduct, the extent of the calamity which had fallen upon him, or how wildly would she have rushed back and clung to him until he had promised that he would not go from home! How eloquently would she have persuaded him that their father would relent, and all would yet be well! Happily for her, she did not know; and not attempting any solution of his unusual conduct, she descended the stairs to her mother's room.</p>
               <p>It was now dark, and, striking a light, Hugo Blanc commenced making the necessary arrangements for leaving his father's house.</p>
               <p>First taking the note addressed to his mother and sister from its hiding-place, he laid it conspicuously upon his table; then taking a small bit of drawing-paper from his portfolio, he sat down and commenced a rapid sketch from recollection of the scene upon the lake shore, which his sister had described to him in her story, and, when finished, addressed it upon its back to "Mary Grattan," and laid it with the note upon the table. He then calmly collected together the few necessary articles of clothing which he could conveniently carry, and placed them, with his pallet, brushes, colors, a small painting or two, and a sketch-book, in a sack which had been used in his sketching excursions to carry his materials.</p>
               <p>These preparations completed, he returned again to the window and looked out upon the scene, which was fast being lost in the gathering gloom of night. Far off above the trees, which stretched away to some distance toward the west, he saw the glimmering of a single light, which he well knew lighted the apartment of Mary, and he felt that she was there at this moment, perhaps in no better frame of mind than himself. He felt sure, from what his sister had told him, that her feelings toward him were of a nature possibly not well understood by herself; and while he could not repress a feeling of sadness for her grief at his situation, a sense of joyful pride rose up in the midst of his sorrows, that he was sure of the earliest and best affections of a tender and loving girl, who, to his excited imagination, was no less than an angel. He continued<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6567-00000066"/> tinued to gaze upon the light, as he indulged these feelings, and as it twinkled in the gloom like some far off star, he sank into a dreamy revery, and at length dropping his head upon his arm, he was soon lost to the troubles and anxieties which had harassed him through this day.</p>
               <p>Hugo slept. Upon the table in his room the candle still burned, and but faintly illuminated its gloom; a death-like hush reigned within and without; not a breath of air disturbed the stillness of the night, and he slept calmly and quietly. No dream disturbed his slumbers; not a muscle moved to indicate that a single faculty was yet keeping guard over the citadel of his soul. All was calm and still as that night which knows no morn. The night grew darker, and the hours advanced, and the light which had raised such an excitement in his breast still twinkled in the far-off gloom, and sent its feeble rays from the window of her whose image filled his heart, out upon the gathering night, and they struggled through the darkness, like messengers of peace and love, to the window where Hugo still slept, as quietly and calmly as if the emotions of his own heart were as peaceful as the hushed and silent scene around him. Now a form passed between the light which burned in the cottage and the window, and might be dimly seen bending from the window, peering out into the dark night. Mary, too, full of strange emotions which she now for the first time began to understand, gazed anxiously upon the distant light that glimmered in Hugo's chamber, and a thousand keen and hitherto unknown pangs pierced her heart, as she thought of the struggle which that light alone had witnessed. Following the impulses of her impetuous and generous nature, she would have flown to him to offer such consolation and hope as <emph>she</emph> could gather from his future prospects; and when she thought of their approaching interview, a thousand hopeful things to be said to him then ran through her mind which were forgotten when they did meet. Again she had almost formed the resolution to visit Mr. Blanc herself, and try to soften him toward his son. Failing here, she would plead with Hugo to give up his art, and conform himself to his father's wishes; failing again, she would plead with him for her own sake—ah, yes! for her own sake. It has then come to this, Mary; and you now understand the strange thrill that ran through your frame when Hugo drew you to his side at your last interview, and this revelation of your <emph>real</emph> feelings has made you shrink from the execution of all these plans.</p>
               <p>Wearied with these mingled emotions and conflicting impulses, another gentle head is bowed upon the rounded arm, and another pair of lovely eyes, inflamed with recent tears, are closed in balmy sleep. The night waxed later and later, and the lights of the distant village disappeared one by one; while the gloom without settled upon all things, save those which caught up and reflected the rays of these two lights, which still burned feebly and dimly.</p>
               <p>Who shall tell of the unseen spirits that watched over this youthful pair, or unfold the mysterious bond that linked their souls together? The agony of mind which both had suffered while waiting for the slow hours to wing their flight, had found relief in sleep, and both had passed into a state of forgetfulness, while enjoying that gratification which youthful lovers can only understand, of gazing each upon the solitary light which illumined the chamber of the other, indulging in such thoughts as their mutual positions called up; and now, while they slept, the busy world was gradually hushed to the stillness of death.</p>
               <p>A low moaning sound broke at last upon the silence without, and a gentle breeze came sighing through the old chestnut forest that bordered the lake, and played with the curls which profusely adorned the head of the sleeping youth. An occasional flash illuminated the western sky, and brought into bold relief the craggy summits of the mountains which stood at the extremity of the little lake; and the old pine-trees, which clung to these crags, stretched forth their naked arms like skeletons of the departed. The breeze seemed gradually to gain strength with every gust, which came with mournful sighs through the trees and shrubbery which surrounded the<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6567-00000067"/> house. The sound of the clock from the distant church spire came sorrowfully upon the wings of the wind, and smote upon the ear of the sleeping youth, arousing him to a full consciousness of his situation. Raising his head from his arm, he counted the strokes of the clock till it tolled out twelve sad and weary chimes, which, as they died upon his ear, seemed each to have an increased expression of sadness upon his handsome and manly countenance. He looked once more in the direction of the cottage window, and saw the form of Mary against the light which still burned in her room. She had also been aroused by the sounds which came from the old church spire, and was fully aware with what grief this sad hour was laden, to poor Hugo as well as to herself; and as they each looked upon the distant light, and became aware of the presence of the other, who shall say that the spirit of the boy and the spirit of the girl did not hold communion? For a moment they both stood looking at each other, wrapped in their own reflections, and then left their positions to prepare for that sad interview which was shortly to take place.</p>
               <p>Hugo carefully extinguished the light after securing his little bundle and a stout stick, which was his constant companion, and groping his way to the door, silently and carefully descended into the hall below. Here he paused, to listen if any one was yet astir, but no sound disturbed the stillness, which was so profound that the agitated beatings of his own heart were audible. He moved on quietly toward the old hall-door, stepping with great care, lest the creaking of some loose board might arouse some member of the family. He saw the light under the door of his father's library, and breathlessly hurrying past, reached the door, which he slowly opened, and descending the steps, stood alone in the gravel walk. He turned to take a last look at the old parental mansion, and peering through the window of his father's library, saw him bending over his table, busily engaged in writing, and apparently thinking nothing of the scene which had so recently occurred between himself and his son. Hugo turned away in sorrow, and adjusting his little pack upon his shoulder, grasped his stick stoutly in his hand, and descended rapidly to the gate, which he opened, and taking the road toward the village, was soon lost in the gloom of the surrounding forest.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">MR. BLANC'S REFLECTIONS—MRS. BLANC PROTESTS—EXCITING DISCUSSION—DISCOVERY OF HUGO'S FLIGHT.</head>
               <p>MR. BLANC sat for some time, after Hugo had left him, absorbed in reflection, growing out of the past interview. He did not believe that his son would leave home, but he was, at least, convinced that it would be no easy task to eradicate his love for Art, and direct his energies to more practical pursuits; but this he determined to accomplish at all hazards, and he flattered himself that it had been a happy thought in him to browbeat and tyrannize over his son as he had done, because his terror at this exhibition of displeasure would more effectually check his artistical tendencies, and prepare the way for his return to business so soon as he should recover from the shock consequent upon his disappointment. Mr. Blanc felt quite satisfied with himself, and was disposed to adulate his own shrewdness, as he sat for some time and thought upon these plans, rubbing his hands meanwhile with evident satisfaction. We know many Mr. Blanc, and could place our finger upon a dozen at any time without much trouble—sage, wise fathers, who are perfectly clear in their own minds what is best for their sons, and equally clear that the latter know nothing of what is best for themselves—men who constantly preach and practice the "sternly real," and are entire skeptics upon the subject of the <emph>ideal,</emph> believing that those who devote time and talent to pursuits coming under the latter head, are either natural fools, insane, or have had their education sadly neglected by careless or culpable parents. So warped are such men by the accursed practices of trade, and so hardened do they become by the contaminating influences of an exclusive and soulless Mammon-worship, that they can see no good growing out of anything which has not the almighty dollar in the perspective, as the sole inducement to exertion. Talk to them of natural tastes, of early-developed talent, pointing in any other direction than the one they have traveled, and you will be laughed at; and it would be a useless task to try to convince them that coarse and vulgar kind, which is all they have ever known—the enjoyment of making money!</p>
               <p>It is sufficient at present to inform the reader that Mr. Blanc was an eminent example of this kind of man; and as I prefer to let his character develop itself in the course of these pages, I shall, for the present, drop these speculations, which have only been indulged in, that those who follow me through may not be surprised at any exhibition of heartlessness in a character that has been educated in such a school.</p>
               <p>For some time after his son had left him, I have said Mr. Blanc sat indulging in very self-complacent reflections upon the shrewdness with which he had managed that interview; and having reached this happy frame of mind, and quieted the "still, small voice" which had whispered in his ear, in spite of all his selfish and short-sighted philosophy, that he had acted harshly and unfeelingly toward Hugo, he turned to his table, and was soon busily engaged in answering several business letters which required his attention. No one, to have looked in upon this man, so apparently tranquil, would have dreamed of the nature of the conversation which, but a short time before, he had had with his only son; and for some hours the busy scratching of his pen, as letter after letter was finished and received its address, was the only noise which broke the silence. At length he threw himself back in his chair, and placed his hand to his forehead, with the air of a man who asks himself: "Is anything forgotten?" and while still in this attitude, he was startled<pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6567-00000069"/> by hurried footsteps in the hall approaching the door, which was opened the next moment, and Mrs. Blanc entered, and closing it carefully, seated herself near him, before he had time to conjecture what had given rise to so unexpected, not to say unusual, a visit from his wife.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Blanc's countenance was seriously disturbed, and with her usual kind and affectionate manner there was now mingled an expression of anxiety and concern, which puzzled him considerably, and if he guessed at the cause which brought her there, he had presence of mind enough not to betray it by any change of feature, as he asked, partly in seriousness, partly in jest:</p>
               <p>"What is the matter, Mrs. Blanc? I had supposed you long since in the land of dreams."</p>
               <p>"Not so," she replied, seriously; "I have been sitting up for you, and should not have ventured to disturb you, but I could not sleep until I had spoken to you about our dear boy—about Hugo."</p>
               <p>"What of him?" said Mr. Blanc, with a start; "has he gone?"</p>
               <p>"Not that! not that!" she replied. "But I wished to reason with you a little, and try to induce you to relax a little of your severity toward him."</p>
               <p>"Ah! that is it!" he replied, evidently relieved, at the same time manifesting no great satisfaction at what was likely to follow. "Well, what wise <emph>woman's</emph> argument have you to bring, to alter my purpose?" he asked, with marked emphasis on the word "woman's."</p>
               <p>"The wisest and the best," Mrs. Blanc replied; "a mother's love—which ofttimes sees deeper and clearer than a father's simple calculation, uninfluenced by such a feeling."</p>
               <p>This remark, so clear and decided, uttered with so much unflinching firmness, and conveying such a cutting rebuke—coming, too, from his mild and gentle wife—for a moment startled Mr. Blanc, and it required some time for him to recover sufficiently from his astonishment to reply. He was then, however, himself again—cold, unfeeling, calculating—and he replied, severely:</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Blanc, you astonish me! do you come here, not only to espouse the cause of our silly and wayward son, but to insult <emph>me?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Neither," she answered, with the same unmoved manner, but in the sweetest and most gentle voice, "neither; but I came to talk to you plainly, and I am impelled alone by my affection for Hugo, and the conviction that such severity as you manifest toward him will not accomplish the result you propose."</p>
               <p>"And what sage and prudent course would you advise instead, to bring it about?" he asked, with a bitter sneer.</p>
               <p>"I would advise that you make no war upon his tastes, but rather assist him, and, if need be, <emph>advise him,</emph> in the most proper direction to insure success. If he has not the talent to succeed, he will find it out in good time himself. If he has, success may accomplish all that you wish for him, and more."</p>
               <p>"Oh, this is intolerable!" cried Mr. Blanc, losing patience; "what would you have me do? assist him to make a beggar of himself!—a wandering fool!—an itinerant madman! Would you have me encourage him in becoming a <emph>painter?</emph>" he said, throwing out the last word furiously, as if it expressed the very concentration of all the folly and nonsense in the world.</p>
               <p>"What <emph>you</emph> fail to do," Mrs. Blanc answered, "I feel convinced he will do for himself."</p>
               <p>"And upon what do you ground this conviction?"</p>
               <p>"Upon the fact that the very earliest manifestations of taste upon his part have been in this direction, and that it has constantly been gaining strength, and within the last few months it has amounted to a passion."</p>
               <p>"This all comes," Mr. Blanc answered, furiously, "of his intimacy with that vagabond Grattan. He is a fine example in point! Miserable, worthless incubus! with physical force enough to accomplish something in a <emph>practical</emph> way, but lazily flittering away his time dabbling in colors, and splashing his <unclear>ideal</unclear> nonsense upon canvas, until, reduced to beggary, he some weeks since left his family to subsist upon the charity<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6567-00000070"/> of his friends, I suppose (if he has any), and has gone, God knows where! He is a fine model for your son, Mrs. Blanc."</p>
               <p>"That Mr. Grattan has not succeeded thus far," Mrs. Blanc replied, still preserving her serene manner, "is more his misfortune than his fault. He has fine talent as an artist, and generous, noble impulses as a man; but being poor, he has not been master of his own movements, has been obliged to waste his time and energies in a little community which has neither given him countenance nor sympathy."</p>
               <p>"I wish to God," said Mr. Blanc, fiercely striking the table with his hand, "I wish to God that they had tarred and feathered him and drummed him out of the village, before he ever instilled his infernal nonsense into the head of my son! But I will crush it out, let it cost what it may; I will crush it out, Mrs. Blanc."</p>
               <p>"And with it you will crush out all in him that is worth preserving—leaving the mere semblance of a man, filled with a sordid, avaricious, grasping appetite for money alone—or you will make him reckless and indifferent to everything, and risk plunging him into all sorts of excesses and dissipation."</p>
               <p>"If it comes to that," Mr. Blanc continued, "let it come. I should still feel conscious of having done my duty toward him. I would sooner see him dissipated, dissolute—anything—than such a driveling, sentimental fool as this Grattan."</p>
               <p>"You do Mr. Grattan great injustice, Mr. Blanc. He is a most excellent man—kind-hearted, generous, sympathizing, and full of those tastes that would insure the greatest amount of happiness; and while you apply so many unjust, not to say ungenerous, epithets to him, you should recollect that the end is not yet. Mr. Grattan is a young man yet, with talent and ability to make his mark."</p>
               <p>"No, no!" Mr. Blanc replied, with a bitter laugh; "the end is not yet; he has neither reached the poorhouse, penitentiary, or gallows; but I do not well see how he can escape one of these, or the insane asylum; and as to talent and ability, if he has them, he would do well to turn them to better use."</p>
               <p>"Listen to me, Mr. Blanc," said she, "dispassionately, if you can. I grant that at best the life of an artist is an unenviable one, filled with trials, reverses, and mortifications, as it is, and if I believed it possible to smother our boy's taste without destroying his ambition (<emph>as the world is now</emph>), I could wish it done. But there is no choice left. There are a class of minds which require something higher, purer, more elevating than mere money-making, to secure their happiness; and I believe Hugo to be one of this class. He may not make so much money as those who follow other pursuits, but I believe he will be infinitely more happy in the pursuit of an artist than he would be in any other."</p>
               <p>"What silly nonsense, Mrs. Blanc! You talk of happiness as if it were all-sufficient, without food to our mouths or clothes to our backs. Do you believe that Hugo will be happy by the exercise of this silly talent alone, without money?" he asked, with an air of triumph.</p>
               <p>"I will answer your question," she replied, "by asking another. Do you believe that he can be happy in cheating and swindling his fellow-men—in the pursuit of fortune in the way of <emph>trade?</emph> Would you not rather see his fine countenance cloudless and unfurrowed, reflecting the fullness of his joy in his profession, even though he be poor, than to see that same face distorted, prematurely old, reflecting only the same keen, grasping appetite for money which meets you in the face of almost every business man you see?"</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Blanc," said he, thrown considerably off his balance, "you have, woman-like, determined to carry a point, and jumped at conclusions from extreme cases for that purpose. One would think from your conversation that you did not believe there was an honest man in this world. In short, that honesty and money could not exist together."</p>
               <p>"I do not believe that they <emph>can not,</emph> but I believe that they seldom <emph>do</emph> exist together; and I would rather see our son a poor but happy artist, than a rich, dishonest tradesman. It<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6567-00000071"/> is quite certain that he can not be modeled into the latter, and I think that good sense should lead us to direct his tastes as an artist, in such a way as to secure him from much of the embarrassment which is the common lot of those in that profession, and be most likely to insure him success. <emph>I</emph> have no fear about his talent—this will secure fame; and fame, all the rest that you could desire for him, and I can not see upon what you ground your bitter opposition."</p>
               <p>"Then I will tell you. You have looked upon the whole matter with a woman's eye, and have woven together a very ingenious, still very shallow, woman's argument. In the first place, your hopes are fallacious, and upon these you ground your arguments, and of course they have no solid foundation. I know something about the world from experience, and know that the world does nothing for those who bring nothing into the common stock. Hence we see all persons who are devoted to what you call higher and purer pursuits, are living upon sustenance as pure and ethereal as their professions—upon nothing. And it is right that it should be so; there is a principle of compensation which runs through everything in this life, and the man who does nothing should expect nothing."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Blanc," she replied, "I am surprised at your sentiments. Do you suppose that the Creator placed us here for the sole purpose of entering into a struggle for wealth? Are we not endowed with higher and holier aspirations? And are those who devote their lives to the more elevating and refined professions, and are constantly sending their productions forth into the world to humanize the masses who have been brutalized by just such theories as you have advocated, doing nothing for the improvement of mankind? We should degenerate into communities of wolves and hyenas, if your arguments prevailed, and the world would become worse than a hell."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Blanc uttered this sentence in an earnest and deeply excited manner, and Mr. Blanc's look of astonishment increased as she proceeded. He felt that his wife had the advantage of him in the argument, and with this feeling there was another, that he was losing his power over her. She had presented herself to him this night in an entirely new character, and he proposed, by resuming his firm, stern manner, to humble and frighten her into her former quiet submission. These thoughts passed more rapidly through his mind than we have been able to recount them, and he turned upon her when she had finished with one of his most withering glances, and shaking his finger threateningly at her, said—</p>
               <p>"I have listened, madam, entirely too long to your silly attempt to sustain Hugo in a willful act of disobedience. I shall listen no longer; and to satisfy you that I am earnest in my intentions, I will inform you that I have this evening had an interview with him, and he left me with the distinct understanding that his 'daubing' was to cease, or that he must leave this house. If he chooses the latter alternative, I am determined never to countenance him in any way."</p>
               <p>"He will do it, nevertheless," said Mrs. Blanc, who now, seeing all hope at an end, burst into tears. Her unusual exhibition of self-command had suddenly left her when the hope of a reconciliation between Hugo and his father was at an end, and she made no further attempt to conceal her tears; while Mr. Blanc stood calmly looking at her, exhibiting in his countenance the same total indifference which he had done but a short time previous, when his son stood before him similarly affected. After looking at her in this way for some time, he said to her—</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Blanc, I hope you will learn from this interview that it is my determination to govern my family myself, and also that you have very much forgotten yourself in attempting to swerve me from my resolution, by coming here to brave me, as you have done in your manner of advocating the cause of this disobedient boy."</p>
               <p>"I did not come here to brave you," said Mrs. Blanc, rising to her feet to go; "if Hugo's taste was a mere evanescent thing, or if there were no clear manifestations of extraordinary talent, I should not have said a word. Indeed,<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6567-00000072"/> if such had not been the case, there would not have been such determined adherence on his part. I have done nothing but what was my right and my duty to do as a wife and mother. Neither shall I dispute your right to govern your family in your own way; but," she said, turning to him with a look which would have softened any heart but his, "I beg of you, Mr. Blanc, beware that you do not govern your family with such an iron rod that you annihilate every spark of remaining affection for yourself. You will find it a cold world, Mr. Blanc, deprived of the affection of your wife and children."</p>
               <p>These last words were spoken with such earnestness and firmness that they struck almost prophetically upon the ear of Mr. Blanc, but before he could rally to reply she had left the room, closing the door behind her. He stood just where she had left him for some minutes, as the reader will readily conceive, in no very pleasant frame of mind. Her last words had opened his eyes to a probable state of things growing out of this matter of which he had not dreamed, and it was not a comfortable thing, even for him, to contemplate. He reviewed the character of his wife, and he found that she had ever been kind, affectionate, and gentle—assiduous in all her household duties; ever anticipating his most trifling wishes, and devoting herself, with the most self-sacrificing care, to the mental and moral culture of their son and daughter, who had now grown up, the one to the age of twenty and the other seventeen; both sharing largely in these gentle and much-to-be-desired attributes of his wife. But her manner in this past interview opened up to him a new phase in her character, and her last words rang in his ears as a warning to him, that even her powers of endurance, mild and forbearing as she was, might be overtaxed. But he had been schooled in the rough world; in the manner that our modern philosophers tell us is best calculated to make useful men. He had been accustomed to meet and overcome difficulties, and had come to think his own will law in all matters connected with his own business or domestic affairs.</p>
               <p>Starting in the world like many another promising young man, with sufficient intellect to make him an ornament to any position or profession, he had rushed into that vortex which has swallowed up many like him (the whirpool of trade), and in the petty transactions of this kind of life, from which he had long since retired, had willfully thrown aside all his better feelings, and adopting that maxim which is perverting the better nature of thousands of men every year—"take the world as it is"—had gone into the struggle with the determination to conquer the world with its own weapons; and as a necessary consequence, degenerated into the kind of man we find him at the opening of our story. The better feelings of his nature had been gradually deadened, or entirely extinguished, by that process of "taking the world as it is," and for a moment, as he stood here, thinking of his wife's last words, he saw himself as he was, and he shrank with disgust from the picture. The next moment these unpleasant feelings had vanished, and he was again the stern man who "takes the world as it is;" and shaking his clenched fist at the door which had just closed behind his wife, he muttered between his teeth—"By Heavens! it <emph>shall</emph> be as I desire, and come what will, I will raise this boy as <emph>I</emph> wish, or he may get his living in his 'refined and elevating pursuit' if he can."</p>
               <p>Mr. Blanc, as the reader has already discovered, notwithstanding his professions, could ornament his language when excited with passion, in the presence of his family or when alone; but he has never been known to forget what was due to consistency elsewhere, and his reputation was untarnished as a man of probity and piety. So pleased was he, indeed, with this eloquent sarcasm upon his son's taste, that he changed his fierce manner for a brutal laugh.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, Mrs. Blanc had retired to her own room, overcome by the scene we have just narrated, and seating herself, reflected upon the probable result of the occurrences of the past day and night. She was, as we have said, a most faithful wife, a gentle and loving mother; but she had a firmness and decision of character beneath this exterior, which in all her past intercourse with her husband had never been<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6567-00000073"/> aroused until that night; and knowing herself how strong this principle was within her, she trembled to look forward upon the life that was to follow this first misunderstanding with her husband.</p>
               <p>She, like him, did not believe that Hugo could leave his home, notwithstanding his father's severe treatment; but she knew his character better than Mr. Blanc did, and saw clearly how fatal to him it would be, to force him upon a life at variance with every impulse of his nature. She had been made to feel, during the conversation with Mr. Blanc, how little importance he attached to her opinions, and how little her wishes were to be regarded when they chanced to be opposed to his own; and as many a poor woman has done before her, she looked back upon her past life—back to the time when, full of love, full of hope, he had led her to the altar—and she wondered how he could be so changed, or how, if he was then as now, <emph>she</emph> could have been so deceived.</p>
               <p>During her interview with him, the storm which had been threatening, and which neither had noticed, in the excitement of their conversation, burst upon the house, increasing in violence every moment, and the driving rain and roaring wind, which made it tremble, broke in upon her reveries. Blinding flashes of lightning, followed by stunning reports of thunder, alternated with each other in quick succession; and Mrs. Blanc, becoming more and more alarmed at the violence of the storm, left her seat with the intention of going to the window to look out, when a brilliant and lurid flash, more dazzling than any which had preceded it, and followed by a deafening crash of thunder, stunned her for a moment, and almost threw her to the floor. Recovering soon from the shock, she hurried to a window which faced the mountain, and through which a broad and steady light was reflected upon the wall, apprehensive that either the house or some of the out-buildings had been struck by lightning, and were in flames. She was relieved from her fears, however, when she saw, a few rods from the house, a tall pine which had been torn to atoms by the passage of the electric current, some resinous splinters of whose dry branches had been ignited, and were now blazing brightly, rendering the darkness without almost impenetrable, while the wind caught up the flames and sparks, and whirled them far up the steep sides of the mountain, until they were extinguished by the descending torrents of rain. She was still standing in this position, watching the effect of the angry elements upon the old shattered pine, when her alarm was increased by the voice of her daughter, calling to her in a wild and excited tone from the hall, and seizing a light, she hurried out, and was joined by Mr. Blanc, who had also been disturbed by the same occurrence. From the foot of the stairs they beheld Louise standing upon the landing above in her night-clothes, wringing her hands in the wildest excitement, and calling to them to hurry up stairs. Both hastily ran up, and following their daughter, who had turned and ran forward, uttering unintelligible cries of distress, all arrived in Hugo's little studio. Here Louise threw herself into a chair, and pointing to the table, exclaimed: "Father! mother! look there upon the table—that note from Hugo! Oh!" she cried, "he has gone, he has gone, and in such a night as this!" she continued, looking out of the window. "Oh, it is too bad! it is a shame!"</p>
               <p>"What are you doing up at this time of night?" Mr. Blanc inquired angrily of Louise. "You look as if you had not been to bed. What brought you here?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, father!" she answered, "I had a long talk with Hugo in his room last evening, and he wept so sorrowfully and talked so strangely, that I could not lie down to sleep, and only thought of the strange manner in which he spoke to me. When the crash of thunder came, my first thought was that the house had been struck by lightning, and I took my light and hurried here to see if Hugo was hurt. I found only this note to give any explanation of his absence. Is it not shamefully cruel to drive him forth in such a night?"</p>
               <p>While she was speaking, Mr. and Mrs. Blanc had approached the table, and Mr. Blanc, taking up the note,<pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6567-00000074"/> opened it and read it through without uttering a word; then handing it to Mrs. Blanc, went with a candle to his son's sleeping-room, as if still doubting the firmness of his resolution. He soon returned to his wife and daughter, with an indescribable expression of rage upon his countenance, and found Mrs. Blanc standing by the side of the table, with Hugo's letter in her hand, while the tears streamed from her eyes, and Louise still sitting in the chair, with her hands clasped over her face, rocking to and fro, sobbing as if her heart would break.</p>
               <p>"I could not have believed," said Mr. Blanc, trembling with rage, "that this boy would have dared to take such a step; but since he has ventured upon it, he shall be as firmly shut out of my heart as if he was an utter stranger."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Blanc," cried Mrs. Blanc, seizing him by the hand, and looking through her tears into his face, "is it possible that you are not now softened by this affectionate note from out noble boy?"</p>
               <p>"Softened!" said he, wildly; "softened by an affectionate note which covers an inexensable act of disobedience? If you before considered me hard, you shall now see that I am steel, and every word of what I threatened I will adhere to. What is that you hold in you hand?" he continued, turning to his daughter.</p>
               <p>"Only a little drawing," she replied, "which Hugo left for Mary Grattan."</p>
               <p>"Give it to me!" he exclaimed, snatching it from her, tearing it into a thousand pieces, and stemping it upon the floor. "There! may a curse rest upon this infernal propensity to draw."</p>
               <p>"Oh, father! Don't," said Louise, rushing toward him, but too late to prevent him from destroying it. "Oh!" she continued, looking upon the scattered fragments lying upon the floor; "father, how <emph>could</emph> you do this? What shall I say to Mary?"</p>
               <p>"Say to her?" Mr. Blanc answered, his eyes flashing; "say nothing to her, unless you wish to incur may displeasure also. It is to her vagabond father that we owe these elegant tastes of you brother, and I doubt not they will soon meet, mutually to condole over their early folly."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Blanc," said Mrs. Blanc, again approaching him, "you are unkind to Hugo, as well as to Mr. Grattan, and I am surprised at such an exhibition of injustice and temper."</p>
               <p>Mr. Blanc was in no mood to endure any further contradiction, and he strode from the room as if fearful that his passion might carry him too far; while Mrs. Blanc, entirely overcome, sank heavily into a chair. Louise, forgetting for the time her won sorrow in witnessing the grief of her mother, trials through which her son had to battle his way, and her grief knew no bounds. Add to this the mortification which she felt at such an exhibition of temper on the part of Mr. Blanc—temper which he had not been able to restrain in the presence of Louise—and the reader may judge with what a crushing weight these bitter trials fell upon her.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
               <head type="sub">INTERVIEW AT THE GARDEN GATE—MUTUAL DECLARATION OF LOVE—HUGO'S DEPARTURE.</head>
               <p>ENTERING the forest on the road leading to the village, Hugo pressed forward with rapid steps toward Grattan's cottage; and the conviction that Mary would meet him at the appointed place, alleviated much the pain occasioned by the circumstances under which he left home. He had but a faint idea of what was before him, and every artist will testify that this was a fortunate circumstance. Still, a dim foreshadowing of his future life was impressed upon his mind with sufficient clearness to make him feel keenly and bitterly the difficulties and degradation of his position. Paramount to all this, however, was a firm resolve to gain a position of eminence in his new profession, the buoyant effect of which prevented any unmanly display of weakness in view of the events just past; and as he strode along through the wood with a rapid and vigorous step, an observer, judging from his outward appearance, would not have guessed his real frame of mind. For, with all these events pressing heavily upon him, his ambitious hopes for the future, his manly yearning for a position in life, and the determination to gain that position unaided, gave to his step a firmness, and to his whole bearing an air of independent self-reliance, which could not have existed without these stimulants.</p>
               <p>If his mind reverted to the injustice of his father's conduct, the reflection was accompanied with a determination to conquer all adverse influences, even his hard-heartedness, and revive, if it had ever existed, a real affection for himself, which should have a solid basis upon his true merits. The gloom which would have otherwise settled upon his spirits, when he thought of the distress of his mother and sister, was chased away by that joyful meeting in the dim future which he pictured to himself, when, flushed with the pride of well-merited honors, he should again return to them, to restore that link in the family circle which had been so rudely and unfeelingly broken. This scene was so palpably impressed upon his mind, that he held his head proudly aloft and walked rapidly forward, with more the air of one who controlled, than of one who was controlled by fate, as his future triumphs were brightly pictured to his imagination.</p>
               <p>These reflections were, however, suddenly checked by a glimmering light through the trees, which announced his proximity to Grattan's house. As he paused and looked forward at the light, his whole manner underwent a change; his head drooped forward, his hands were tightly clasped together, and his breast heaving with new and powerful emotions, widely differing from those which had a few moments before impressed him.</p>
               <p>"Ah, Mary!" he exclaimed, suddenly, "I had forgotten in my bright anticipations of future glorious achievements, to what an interview I was hastening, and overlooked the fact, that all the triumphs I have anticipated are to be purchased at the sacrifice of the most cherished of all my associations. But," he continued, after a pause, as if reviewing in his mind all that had so recently occurred, "even this sacrifice must be made, and it now only remains for me to learn whether I have anticipated too much, or whether I shall meet that affection on her part which will justify such pain as I feel at the thought of parting."</p>
               <p>Full of this resolution, he again resumed his walk, and had gone but a short distance, when he was startled by the sound of rapidly approaching footsteps, and in the next instant a tremulous voice called out, "Hugo, is that you?"</p>
               <p>"Mary! Mary!" he cried out, joyfully running forward<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6567-00000076"/> and taking both her hands, "is it possible that you have come out alone to meet me? I had just been asking myself whether I should find you all that I hoped, and whether I should learn that I had really any occasion to feel grieved at our separation?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know what you hoped to find me, Hugo, or what would constitute a sufficient cause for grief on your part. I simply know that I am very unhappy that you are going to leave us in such a terrible way, and felt it to be my duty to grant your request to meet you. I did not stop to analyze my feelings; I am here, full of sorrow at the circumstances which have compelled this step, and willing to do anything in my power to contribute to your happiness."</p>
               <p>"Think a moment, Mary," he replied, gently pressing her hands; "was it a simple sense of duty that impelled you to come here to meet me? Was it simply a friendly desire to contribute to my happiness?" And then, feeling her hands sensibly tremble in his grasp, he added, appealingly, "Mary, am I not to be stimulated in my pilgrimage by a knowledge that you entertain a more tender sentiment for me than friendship? Will you not allow me to look forward to that time when you will give me my warmest welcome home again? May I not hope for such a place in your heart, Mary, as you occupy in mine? These are the all-important questions I came here to solve to-night; and your answer, believe me, will much affect my future happiness."</p>
               <p>The evident effort to control her feelings which was manifest in her answer, gradually gave way as Hugo proceeded, and when he concluded, she replied: "Ah! Hugo, it would be folly in me to attempt now to disguise, either from you or myself, the true condition of my feelings. I had hoped to pass through this interview so bravely and indifferently that you would not suspect how very dear you are to me; but my courageous resolves all vanish, when I see you about to sunder the dearest ties to commence a struggle for success in a laudable ambition, and I feel it not only improper, but impossible to dissemble. You are as dear to me, Hugo, as I can by any possibility be to you. The certainty that we are to separate, has thrown a flood of light upon my feelings, and revealed a state of things hitherto but little understood. But, Hugo," she added, earnestly, "is it, after all, inevitable that you must go? Are there no means of softening your father? Must you leave home and friends in such a manner as this?"</p>
               <p>"There is no alternative, Mary. I have tried every argument, to no purpose. I must submit to be made a business man, after my father's model, or follow the dictates of those feelings which I can not believe were given to me only to entail misery, and make <emph>myself</emph> an artist. This, you know, has been the dream of my life, and the prospect of its realization makes me almost indifferent to the trials which I feel sure are before me. If I need any other stimulant to exertion, Mary, the assurance you have just given me will make my difficulties almost trifling. I shall undertake my task with comparative cheerfulness."</p>
               <p>"I am so glad to hear you say so, Hugo. I was so much afraid that these hardships would beget a settled melancholy, which would gradually develop the same kind of misanthropy that overshadows my poor father. His is a noble nature—almost if not entirely crushed out by the saddest possible experiences."</p>
               <p>"I know—I know, Mary. He has seen little of life to make it even tolerable to him; but we will hope that he is now in a position where his real merits will be discovered and acknowledged."</p>
               <p>"I fear not," she replied, sadly.</p>
               <p>"You fear, Mary! Have you heard anything to excite fear? Has your father written, at last?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Hugo, at last; I have not, however, the remotest idea what he has written. The letter came this afternoon, and I only know that it could contain no good news, for mother has done nothing but cry ever since it came. All my questions and entreaties have failed to put me in possession of the contents of this letter; but I feel certain that it is the<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6567-00000077"/> herald of some new misery to us all. When I came here, Hugo," she added, earnestly, "mother was still up, and sobbing like one whose tears are all gone."</p>
               <p>"Did you ask her anything about the letter?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; I asked her more than she seemed willing to tell. I asked her what father had written such a long letter about, supposing, of course, it was a lengthy and interesting description of his New York experiences; but she evaded my question, as well as many others which I pressed upon her, until at length I naturally put together her strange conduct and some unusual circumstances connected with father's departure, and abruptly asked her to explain to me the reason of father's leaving home at the time and in the manner that he did. This led her to speak of the conduct of Sharkey toward father; and there seemed to be in her mind, as well as in my own, a conviction that there was some secret connected with their intercourse which had been purposely concealed from us; and when she told me that father had mentioned the subject in his letter, my anxiety to read it overcame every other consideration, and I urged mother to permit me to do so as a right. She not only refused me, but treated me harshly and rudely, bidding me leave her, and mention the subject no more."</p>
               <p>"This is very strange, Mary. Your mother would not ordinarily refuse to read to you a letter from your father—would she?"</p>
               <p>"No, Hugo; on the contrary, heretofore, when he has been absent, she has seemed to take pleasure in reading his letters to us. Brother Ed. and I have talked the matter over, and we are both of the opinion that there is some dreadful secret connected with this Sharkey matter, which mother's strange conduct about this letter has strengthened. Sharkey, you know, Hugo, disappeared very suddenly and mysteriously."</p>
               <p>While she was speaking, Hugo gazed at her earnestly; and vague fears which had many times previously arisen unbidden to his mind, again-fastened themselves upon him; and as she concluded, he seized her arm abruptly, and exclaimed, suddenly—</p>
               <p>"Yes, Mary, I know! I know!" and then added, in a low voice, leaning toward her and staring wildly in her face: "Mary, did you know that some people thought that Sharkey was murdered?"</p>
               <p>"You don't mean, Hugo, that there was any suspicion of father?" Mary almost shrieked, throwing her hands up before her with an expression of dumb astonishment.</p>
               <p>"No, no!" Hugo answered, hastily, and placing his hand upon her shoulder to quiet her, "don't look so wild, Mary; no circumstance that I know of could justify any such suspicion, and I don't know that any such was ever entertained. On the contrary, the fact that his clerk left on the same night that Sharkey did, carrying all his papers with him, has settled people in the belief that they were a pair of rascals together, and that the discovery of some former villiany in which they had been mutually engaged, has made it necessary for them to change their locality."</p>
               <p>"This is what people think, Hugo," she answered, clinging to him, and trembling violently. "What <emph>do</emph> you think? Why did you say to me that some people thought that Sharkey had been murdered? Oh, Hugo, this tallies strangely and painfully with wild fears that have occasionally obtruded upon my mind, and which have been more active since the arrival of this mysterious letter. What do <emph>you</emph> think, Hugo?"</p>
               <p>"Think, Mary—what do <emph>I</emph> think!" he stammered, evidently embarrassed at the question; "why, I think there is not the slightest occasion for fear, even, to say nothing about suspicion. Still," he added, after a long pause, "there is something strange in it all; and the question will arise, why was Sharkey continually harrassing your father? Had they ever met before, and if so, what has been the nature of their previous intercourse? A knowledge of all the circumstances connected with your father's departure may naturally suggest such questions, but I can not entertain a suspicion that he is<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6567-00000078"/> in any way connected with Sharkey's disappearance. Do you not think, Mary, such questions are natural?"</p>
               <p>"They have been half formed in my own mind a thousand times, Hugo, suggested probably by the same causes. Would it not be terrible—"</p>
               <p>"Don't, Mary!" Hugo exclaimed, interrupting her; "it is useless, as well as unjust; your father has no more connection with the disappearance of Sharkey than you or I; but, see!" he added, pointing through the trees toward the west, and evidently anxious to change the subject; "the rising wind and the flashing lightning warn me that I have but little more time to give to this interview, Mary; I came here to bid you good-bye for a long time, perhaps, and I must be far on my way before daylight. There are many sad things connected with our parting, but the knowledge that you love me will lift me above them all; and I feel now, strange as it may appear, much more like laughing than crying."</p>
               <p>"I wish I could feel so, too, Hugo," she answered, struggling against her tears; "but, to say nothing of the sorrow I feel that you are leaving us in this way, the strange coincidence—"</p>
               <p>"Say nothing about the coincidence, Mary; it imports nothing. There goes the thunder; it will rain directly, and I must say good-bye. You have made me happy; you have strengthened me to meet my fate manfully and cheerfully, whatever it may be; and now cheer up, Mary, and be not so sad."</p>
               <p>"The very doubt implied in your words, Hugo, is enough to make me sad; the doubt as to what your fate is to be—the doubt as to my father—"</p>
               <p>"Be hopeful, Mary; your father is well enough, or will be well enough in time. Don't, my dear girl, let that bugbear disturb you; we shall both come back to you one of these days, when least you expect it, crowned with laurels. Think of that, Mary, and let sadness, built upon vague surmises, be dismissed—'go to the dogs.' My misery, I confess, is so nearly allied to happiness that I can't cry, for the life of me. Think, Mary," he added again, "how happy we shall be when this hope is made reality."</p>
               <p>As he concluded this sentence, he nervously wiped his eyes, while there was a perceptible tremor in his voice which did not quite tally with his words. Hugo was affecting a buoyancy of spirit which he did not really feel, in the hope of cheering Mary and relieving her mind of fears which his thoughtless remark about Sharkey's disappearance had evidently aroused. He had been speaking in a cheerful tone, and apparently at random, when really he felt as earnestly and deeply as she; and now, when the fitful gusts of wind which came sighing through the trees, the brilliant flashes of lightning, and an occasional report of distant thunder warned him that a storm was rapidly approaching, and that they must soon part for an indefinite period, his assumed gayety and indifference sat upon him with an ill grace, and his expressive face was a mirror in which was reflected the opposite feelings which disturbed him. All this, however, could not be seen by Mary, and she replied to his last remark, after a brief pause, as if she believed what he said—</p>
               <p>"I do, Hugo; but how long will it be before that time? Oh, Hugo, happy as I am in the knowledge that you love me, I can not feel indifferent, as you seem to, as to the consequences of this separation."</p>
               <p>"Not indifferent, Mary," he replied, hastily; "it is not indifference, but the happiness which I feel in the assurance of your love for me overrides every other feeling; and I feel that I can brave any amount of misfortune, to prove myself worthy of your love. If you had said that you did not love me, I could have left you without a care as to what might follow; I should then have been indifferent. But, my dear girl," he added, as another brilliant flash of lightning illuminated the wood, "let us now arrange, while we have time, some plan for our future correspondence. Will it be perfectly agreeable to your mother that we shall correspond by letter during my absence?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, Hugo she will not have the slightest objection.<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6567-00000079"/> My grief, upon the reception of your note, revealed the state of my feelings to her. I made her acquainted with its contents, as I have no secrets from her; and she bade me by all means see you to-night, as you desired. Let us, then, go into the house, where we can talk more deliberately," she added, taking his arm affectionately, "and wait until the storm subsides; for surely you will not go forward and risk the exposure to such a storm as seems likely soon to burst upon us."</p>
               <p>"Yes, my dear girl, I must go on at all hazards. For special reasons, I must be far on my way before daybreak; and, in order to make much progress, I must cross the lake to-night."</p>
               <p>"Cross the lake to-night! What do you mean, Hugo? Are you mad, that you will recklessly brave such dangers? There is not a boat upon the lake that would be safe in such a storm as we are likely soon to have, and you can not possibly reach the other side before it will be here. I am sufficiently unhappy now; do not make me more wretched by unnecessary exposure in such a night as this. The wind is now already increasing," she continued, trying to draw him toward the house, "and will soon swell into a gale."</p>
               <p>"Well, Mary, you shall not have unnecessary cause for alarm on my account; and I promise you if the storm is likely to be very severe, I will stop at Father Grey's until it subsides; but I must at least get that far before it arrives. If I go with you into the house, however happy I should be to prolong our interview, there is no certainty that I shall find it possible to leave for many hours."</p>
               <p>At this expression of his determination to proceed, Mary's fortitude entirely forsook her, and she sobbed audibly and convulsively, while Hugo with the utmost difficulty restrained a similar outburst. She suffered herself, meantime, to be led gently toward the gate, whither he now turned his steps; and as they neared this little barrier which would soon close between two loving hearts, and shut out to them a world of happiness, they were mutually silent under the oppression of their feelings.</p>
               <p>Arrived at the gate, Hugo was the first to speak; and taking Mary's hand affectionately in his, he said: "Here we must part, Mary; but before I leave you, let me exact a promise that you will write me very often, giving me full details of all home matters, no matter how trifling. I am going to a city where no man knows or cares for his neighbor, and where my joys, sorrows, griefs, or disappointments will find no sympathy; and when I am lonely and unhappy—as I must necessarily many times be—a letter from you will cheer and strengthen me, and encourage me to renewed effort."</p>
               <p>"The desire to hear from you frequently will prompt me to write often, and I am sure that the perusal of your letters will be about the only happiness left to me when you are gone. May Heaven's choicest blessings be showered upon you, Hugo; and may you meet with such entire success in your profession as will abundantly repay all your privations." Mary could say no more, and ceased to speak abruptly, conscious that the effort to give further expression to her feelings would only end with a violent outburst of grief, which she wished to avoid on her own as well as his account.</p>
               <p>Hugo imprinted a fervent kiss upon her fair brow, but was so much overcome himself, that he could only utter a fervent "God bless you, Mary! Farewell, farewell!" and disengaging himself from her arms, hurried down the road leading to Grey's cottage.</p>
               <p>Mary watched his retiring form until it disappeared in the surrounding gloom; and then, her feelings bursting through all restraint, she leaned upon the gate and wept violently, still straining her eyes in the direction where he had disappeared, to catch one more glimpse of his retiring form, should it be revealed to her by the lightning, which now every moment illuminated the scene.</p>
               <p>Poor Mary! The dawn of a new life was upon her, and this night she ceased to be a girl, and launched upon her untried sea of womanhood. As she gazed with brimful eye into the increasing gloom, and reflected upon the scene just past, the consciousness that she had already entered upon a new<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6567-00000080"/> existence was fully upon her. The tears, however, which she shed over his departure, were not unmingled with that rapturous sensation of joy known only to youthful lovers. She was proud to feel that she was possessed of traits of character which could draw to herself such a noble nature. The very worship which she gave to him elevated herself, and grief and joy struggled in her bosom for the mastery.</p>
               <p>A few large drops of rain which fell heavily upon the earth aroused her from her revery, and after listening for a moment to the roar of the storm, as it gathered in the distance, she hastily rejoined her mother, who was awaiting her return.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
               <head type="sub">HUGO'S DEPARTURE—CALLS AT THE HOUSE OF GREY—A SUBTERRANEAN MYSTERY—VOYAGE ACROSS THE LAKE.</head>
               <p>HUGO, with hurried steps leaving the main road, struck into a path which diverged in the direction of the fisherman's hut, and soon found himself enveloped in darkness, which, but for the frequent flashes of lightning, would have rendered it exceedingly difficult for him to find his way. After a walk of about a quarter of a mile, the glimmer of a light through the trees, proceeding from the hut of old Grey, was a beacon which rendered the balance of his walk comparatively easy, and he did not stop to speculate upon the singular circumstance that the light should be burning there at that time of night. His mind and heart were too full of his own troubles for any ordinary circumstance to make an impression upon either; and the rising wind, the increased brilliancy of the lightning, the roar of the thunder, and the dashing of the waves against the beach, were alike unheeded. Having reached the little space in front of the hut, which faced the lake, he walked rapidly up to the door, and was about to rap, when his attention was attracted by a boat approaching the shore, containing a single figure, who seemed struggling with a powerful arm to force it into a little cove a short distance from where he stood.</p>
               <p>Surprised at this circumstance, Hugo stood still and watched the movements of the man until he had succeeded in reaching the shore, moored his boat, and began to climb the bank toward the hut. He still kept his position until the mysterious figure had approached to within a short distance, when<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6567-00000081"/> he coughed aloud to warn him that he was observed, and the stranger advanced more cautiously until he was within a few feet of him, when Hugo called out—</p>
               <p>"Who <emph>are</emph> you?"</p>
               <p>"Who are <emph>you,</emph>" was asked in return, "that seem to have taken possession of my house?"</p>
               <p>"Ah! Father Grey, it is you, is it?" exclaimed Hugo, recognizing his voice. "Well, come forward—you would hardly expect <emph>me</emph> to harm you or yours."</p>
               <p>"Hugo," the old man cried, in a voice expressing surprise, "what in the name of Heaven are you doing here at this time of night? Where have you been, and what brought you <emph>here?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"To answer these questions would involve a long story, and I have no time to tell it. You must unmoor your boat again, and set me over the lake, and I will satisfy your curiosity as we go along."</p>
               <p>"Set you over the lake to-night, boy! What are you thinking of? Look there!" he said, pointing to the rushing waters, just then revealed by a brilliant flash of lightning. "Do you think that mortal man could row a boat across the lake in such a gale? Do you think it a safe venture?"</p>
               <p>"Safe, or unsafe, Grey, I <emph>must</emph> be on the other side before daylight."</p>
               <p>"Before daylight you may, perhaps, if the storm subsides; but I have no boat which would live in such a gale as we will have soon. I have even just now returned from raising my nets at great hazard, and the wind has but just commenced to blow. But, Hugo, before I consent to take you over at all, you must explain to me what has brought you here at this time of night for such a purpose. Come in," he said, walking forward and opening the door of the hut, "whatever is the trouble, you will at least be safe here until the storm subsides."</p>
               <p>Hugo followed the old man mechanically into the house, and sat himself down despondingly upon a stool which he presented to him, evincing, at the same time, great disappointment in his manner.</p>
               <p>"Now, my boy," said Grey, drawing another stool to his side, and taking his hand, "what has brought you from home to-night?"</p>
               <p>"Father Grey," said Hugo, evading the question, "I must go over the lake immediately, and if you are not disposed to go with me, will you lend me one of your boats? I can row over by myself."</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha! ha! the boy <emph>is</emph> mad, I believe. See here, Hugo—do you know that the two stoutest men in the county could not row a boat over the lake in this storm?"</p>
               <p>"My God!" exclaimed Hugo, "what shall I do? My father may miss me, and pursue me. I may be found and taken back. If you will consent to neither of my propositions, I must try some of the other fishermen farther up the lake." Here he rose to his feet and started to go, but Grey ran forward, and locking the door returned to his seat and said to him—</p>
               <p>"Young man, you must explain to me what you mean by this strange language, and then, if I deem it proper, I will advise with you what is best to be done."</p>
               <p>Hugo, seeing no escape, ran through the preceding events of the evening, omitting nothing that had transpired between himself and his father, and concluded by reiterating his fixed determination to adhere to his purpose of leaving home. When he had concluded, Grey took him suddenly by the hand and said:</p>
               <p>"Boy, you have the right kind of spirit—you are right! I should have acted just as you have, and I feel quite sure success will crown your most sanguine anticipations—but there is no haste to get over the lake. The storm will not last long, and as soon as it subsides we will be off. In the mean time lie down," he said, pointing to a rude but comfortable bed, which stood in one corner of the room, "and try to sleep; the door is locked, so that you can not be disturbed."</p>
               <p>"Thank you! thank you, Grey, not only for your sympathy and hospitality, but for the kind manner in which you proffer them. But I shall need no sleep, and would not deprive you of rest, which is more necessary to you than to myself."</p>
               <pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC6567-00000082"/>
               <p>"Sleep is of but little consequence to me, and the loss of it does not seem to affect me," said Grey. "I seldom sleep more than three or four hours a night, and often not so much; so that you need feel no hesitation on that account, and you will at least need rest to prepare you for your walk to-morrow."</p>
               <p>Thus urged, Hugo threw himself upon the bed, but no sleep came to cast its mantle of forgetfulness over him; and he lay for some time watching the old man, who was now busy mending some torn nets, and he had also time to notice the apartment and form conjectures as to his habits and mode of living. The paraphernalia of his profession were suspended about the room, in company with guns, powder-flasks, game-bags, two or three sets of oars, interspersed here and there with little rude shelves, sustaining some fine specimens of stuffed birds and water-fowls, which altogether indicated the abode of one who was fond of wild sports. Opposite to where he lay, a strong plank door, which he had never before observed, seemed to afford communication with another room or rooms, and Hugo was perplexed to understand how this could be, as he was well aware that the room in which they then were was the full size of the house, which sat against an immense cliff, rising to an elevation of some forty or fifty feet. The only rational conclusion he could arrive at was, that Grey had ingeniously built his house in this position so that some cave or overhanging cliff should furnish him with more room without additional expense. He was, however, puzzled at the enormous strength of the door which communicated with this part of the establishment, and could not but think it quite inconsistent with the pursuits of a fisherman.</p>
               <p>While he was yet busy with these conjectures, he was startled by the tinkling of a small bell, which seemed to proceed from the bowels of the earth, and he was surprised at this evidence that Grey was not alone here, as was generally supposed. The old man started to his feet at the sound, looked cautiously toward the bed where he lay, and taking up the light, approached the door we have spoken of, and drawing a key from his pocket unlocked it, and entering hastily, closed and locked it after him. All this only excited further Hugo's curiosity; and all his faculties were on the alert to catch what should follow. He could see the light through the cracks between the planks of the door, and a smothered conversation carried on between two persons, which distinctly reached his ears, brought him to the highest pitch of excitement, and a thousand speculations began to run through his head. That Grey was not what he seemed, and was generally supposed to be, was quite certain; and it was equally certain that the public were in error in supposing that he lived here alone.</p>
               <p>The conversation was not long continued, and Grey soon entered the room, locked the door again, and carefully drew some old canvas over it in such a way as to entirely conceal it from view. Hugo's surprise and curiosity fast grew into wonder and astonishment, and he could scarcely resist the temptation to ask some explanation. Grey evidently thought he was asleep, for he returned cautiously to his seat, as if fearful of wakening him, and after sitting some time absorbed in thought, with his head resting upon his hand, he got up, and drawing aside another piece of canvas, took from a shelf which it concealed, a large volume, and sat down to read.</p>
               <p>Hugo watched him through all these movements, and as he now sat absorbed in the contents of the book, he was satisfied that some mystery shrouded the past life of the old man, and he longed to know what it could be. So intent was he upon his movements, that his own situation was for the time forgotten, and he did not heed the violence of the storm, which was now bursting in its fury; and the thunder, wind, and rain, mingling with the roaring surf of the lake, made but little impression upon him. The manner of Grey as he bent over the book was that of a man accustomed to read much, and from pure enjoyment, rather than that of one who reads simply to while away a leisure hour, and to Hugo his whole being seemed to change. He now for the first time observed a decided stamp of intellectual superiority in every movement,<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6567-00000083"/> which excited in his mind a new feeling of reverence and respect, widely differing from that which he had usually accorded to him, as a simple fisherman.</p>
               <p>As Hugo indulged in these reflections concerning Grey, the storm increased in violence, and the sweeping gusts of wind and rain, as they drove against the house, mingled with the deafening roar of the thunder, although they did not seem to disturb the object of his surmises and speculations, attracted his attention and disturbed the current of his thoughts. At this moment, a fearful blast struck the house, attended with the rattling of hail-stones upon the roof, which made every timber of the building tremble, followed by a stunning crash, which shook the very earth upon which it stood, and effectually startled both from their positions. Grey sprung to his feet and ran out into the face of the gale, notwithstanding the torrents of rain and hail by which it was accompanied, which came rushing through the open door, and seemed likely to raise the house from its foundation. Our hero hurried to the door, and with the utmost difficulty closed it, and stood pressing all his strength against it to prevent it from being blown from its fastenings, anxious to know what had happened without. Grey soon came rushing in, drenched with water, and looking at Hugo with a countenance filled with alarm, exclaimed, wildly: "We may thank God, boy, for a very narrow escape! One of the largest pines on the top of the cliff has been torn loose by the storm, and has fallen, together with a large mass of rock and loose stones, within a few feet of us. God knows, if it had fallen upon the house, the world would have need of no further solicitude on our account! Come here!" he exclaimed, going to the window and drawing aside the curtain; "look out upon the lake, and ask yourself where we would most likely be now, if we had ventured to cross, as you proposed some time ago; we could not possibly have reached the island by this time, and should have been exposed to the whole fury of the storm in the widest part of the lake."</p>
               <p>Hugo looked out as he desired, and found sufficient cause to be thankful that he had been prevented from rashly venturing upon the lake. A blackness, so dense that it seemed almost palpable, enveloped everything without, save when a flash of lightning for a moment revealed the lake, tortured and lashed to fury, and the pines and chestnuts on its border bent and twisted to the earth like twigs, while sheets of spray and torrents of rain and hail, driven with violence against the casements, occasionally startled him from his position.</p>
               <p>"Thank God!" he said, turning to Grey, and respectfully taking his hand, "thank God! Mr. Grey, that you have prevented me from an act of folly which would have cost me my lief. There is no boat on the lake which would not be instantly swamped in this gale."</p>
               <p>"You are right, boy," Grey replied, "and if I had been disposed to gratify you, we should both now be at the bottom. But you can evince your gratitude without putting a handle to my name, my fine fellow. Simple Grey, or <emph>Father</emph> Grey, as usual, will answer every purpose, and please me much better."</p>
               <p>"My dear sir, I do not wish to pry into anything which you desire to conceal, but I am satisfied that you are not what you have seemed to us. You are worthy of a respect and consideration, particularly from one so young as myself, which, believe me, would have always been rendered, except that the character you have assumed presupposes, in the minds of most persons, ignorance and low associations, and is often an apology for want of respect and undue familiarity."</p>
               <p>"Spoken like a man! spoken like a man!" cried Grey, patting him on the shoulder. "And this sentence, however enigmatical to <emph>me,</emph> stamps <emph>you</emph> as being possessed of qualities both of head and heart, which, whatever your fate may be, entitle you to success."</p>
               <p>"Grey," said Hugo, deeply moved by the ardent manner of the old man, "these encomiums, whether deserved or not, believe me, arouse all of the good that is in my nature, and I feel proud that you should see, or even <emph>fancy</emph> that you see, meritorious<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6567-00000084"/> rious qualities in me; but I have something to tell you which may somewhat abate your good opinion. I was not sleeping while lying upon your bed, as you evidently supposed, and should have given you some warning that such was the case, but certain mysterious events came so suddenly upon me, that I forgot honor, duty, and everything else, in my astonishment."</p>
               <p>"Better and better!" Grey exclaimed, almost embracing him; "worthy son of an unworthy father! Your conduct in <emph>this</emph> matter but confirms and establishes my good opinion. You have honestly acknowledged, notwithstanding the fear of my displeasure, that you have unintentionally been placed in the position of an eavesdropper. You have had courage and manliness enough to acknowledge it to <emph>me.</emph> I understand it all. But, Hugo," he said, in an altered voice, "you have been witness to things which must not be mentioned. I have a secret buried here which must not be revealed until I choose to reveal it myself, and after giving you the assurance that you do violence neither to the laws of God or man, you must promise me your entire secrecy in regard to what you have seen here, until this time arrives."</p>
               <p>"Willingly! willingly!" Hugo replied, "even without these assurances, for I could not, without ever after hating myself, divulge what has come to my knowledge under such circumstances."</p>
               <p>"You will never regret it, Hugo—you will never regret it. But now the storm is subsiding, and we must make our arrangements for crossing the lake, which will be sufficiently calm again in half an hour. Can I do anything for you in your absence?"</p>
               <p>"No, Grey, unless your efforts may avail something for me in softening my father, and lead him to think better of me, and of my proposed employment."</p>
               <p>"I will see to this, Hugo, and take every favorable occasion to do what I can for you. You will, of course, correspond with your friends, and I reckon myself among the number?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, Grey—my friends are not so numerous but that I can write frequently to you, who, with three others, are all that I can rank as such."</p>
               <p>"Who are the other three, my poor boy? I am curious to know who compose this small number that you elevate to this distinction."</p>
               <p>"My mother and sister," Hugo answered, "and Mary Grattan, who is, perhaps, the dearest of them all," he added, blushing.</p>
               <p>Grey started and colored at the mention of this name, and said to himself, "It is so, then." After a pause, turning to Hugo, he continued—</p>
               <p>"I see, Hugo, I see. You will find me worthy of your confidence, and I will further say, that the state of affairs which this confidence discloses to me will, when you know all, prove to you that silence on your part, in regard to what you have seen and heard here, may be quite important to your own happiness."</p>
               <p>"Trust me for that, Grey, in any event."</p>
               <p>"I do, implicitly, for you have given me evidence of your inborn sense of propriety and honor, which will secure confidence in you wherever you go. Now we understand each other," he said, shaking Hugo's hand as he spoke, "let us go down to the lake shore and prepare one of the boats for our voyage."</p>
               <p>As they went forth for this purpose, the first gray indications of approaching daylight began to manifest themselves, and objects at a short distance were visible. The first thing they noticed was the boats, three in number, thrown high upon the beach by the storm, two of them bottom-side up, having been turned completely over, and both so badly stove in upon the rocks as to be entirely useless without considerable repair. The third one, however, although blown quite out of the water, had escaped serious injury, and it required bat a few moments to bail out the water and get it afloat.</p>
               <p>Hugo's pack was brought from the hut and deposited in the bottom of the boat, and Grey seated himself at the oars, directing Hugo to take the rudder and head the boat for the western shore, which was now dimly visible. They were<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6567-00000085"/> soon gliding rapidly through the water under the impulse given to their little craft by the powerful efforts of Grey, and the countenance of Hugo was filled with sadness as the distance was increased between them and the shore. After half-an-hour's rowing they were near the middle of the lake, and approaching an island which stood about midway between the two shores.</p>
               <p>It was now fairly daylight, and as Hugo looked toward the east, in the direction of his home, a sight presented itself which for the time absorbed every other feeling or emotion. The storm had settled down below the summits of the mountains, and the upper edges of the storm-cloud, and the straggling fleece which followed after, were burning and glowing in the crimson morning light, while the mountains themselves were covered with rolling mists, which crept lazily up their ragged sides, disappearing or mingling with the clouds at their summits. The lake now scarcely moved, save by a few gentle undulations, the remaining indications of the recent storm. Our hero was too much absorbed by the grandeur of the magnificent scene for any grosser feelings to find a lodgment in his heart. The little island was soon passed, and now formed a beautiful foreground to the picture—the few fishermen upon its shore, preparing their nets, giving animation to the scene. Hugo again turned his eyes to the eastern shore of the lake, and now distinctly saw the roof of his father's house, and the white cottage of Mrs. Grattan peeping out from among the foliage, and the village upon the distant shore just receiving the first rays of the morning sun. As the island shut out these familiar objects from his view, he involuntarily waved a silent adieu, and covering his face with his hands, seemed shaken by a grief, in which he remained profoundly buried until the sudden grating of the boat upon the sand awoke him to the fact that they had reached the shore.</p>
               <p>Grey, stepping ashore, drew the boat partly out, and assisted Hugo with his pack, adjusting it upon his shoulders, and taking him by the hand, in most affectionate tones said—</p>
               <p>"Be of good cheer, Hugo, better times are in store for you, and we shall meet, I hope, before long, under happier circumstances."</p>
               <p>"Heaven grant we may!" said Hugo, turning away his face. "Now, Grey, tell me the direction in which I am to go to strike the main road to S——."</p>
               <p>"Follow that path," Grey answered, pointing to a path leading up the side of the mountain, "and about a mile from here you will come out into the road. Twelve miles will bring you to S——, and from there the route to New York is direct, and you will be able to reach it to-morrow by public conveyance. Good-bye, my fine fellow," he said, extending his hand to him, "you shall hear from me soon; in the mean time God prosper you."</p>
               <p>"Farewell, Grey!" said Hugo, with a trembling voice, "farewell! This is separating the last link that binds me to those who are dearest in life!" and nervously wringing his friend's hand, he turned and pursued the course indicated. Grey re-entered the boat and pulled for the opposite shore.</p>

               <head type="sub">MR. GRATTAN'S LETTER—SHARKEY'S MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE PARTLY EXPLAINED—TORTURING COMPUNCTIONS.</head>
               <p>ON the evening into which so many events have been crowded, and previous to the interview between Mary and Hugo, Mrs. Grattan was sitting in her little parlor, holding in her hand the letter which Mary had alluded to, and gazing at it like one who expects, yet dreads, some important revelation, or the clearing up of some mystery. The size of the letter in question might well justify such anticipations, and her agitation was evidently on the increase as she indulged in that kind of guess-work which is so common with us all, when we receive some long-expected message. Even when we have the explanation in our hands, there is a sort of pleasure which grows out of the self-torture of guessing at that which the simple opening of an envelope or breaking a seal may disclose; and we have all of us, many times, held before us some long looked-for or wished-for epistle, and wondered what it would tell us—whether its contents were of good or evil; whether it contained messages of love and affection, or came laden with sorrow and disappointment. Such, in fact, were the emotions of Mrs. Grattan, as she continued to gaze upon the well-known characters of her husband; and as the tears streamed from her eyes, one would have supposed that she had penetrated the mysterious envelope and made herself acquainted with its contents. Certain it is, she partially anticipated the nature of the revelations about to be made to her; for, with many a long-drawn sigh, she slowly broke the seal, and holding the letter in her hand for a moment, struggled hard to calm herself sufficiently to read its contents.</p>
               <p>The letter was written from New York, and as it is important to the full understanding of our story, it is here given in full. It ran thus:</p>
               <div type="letter">
                  <p>MY DEAR KATE—I have at length brought my mind to the determination to write home—home! that name so crowded with past joys and endearments—so full of happy associations, and once so promising of a harvest of future joys. Oh! Kate, my dear wife, I know that long before even these few lines have been read, you have anticipated much of what I have to tell you; but there remains much for you to know. Many of the fiery trials through which I passed previous to my departure have remained locked within my own breast; but as there is no longer any reason for concealing our true position in regard to each other, I shall tell you a tale which will explain much that has appeared mysterious, both in my own conduct and that of others, and show you into what a gulf of misery I have plunged myself in a moment of passion, which led me to forget the consequences to myself—to you, dear Kate, and our children—to whom I am now an exile, I fear in the <emph>vain hope</emph> of bettering my worldly condition. Even if the load of anguish which oppresses me were removed, I should find but little here to encourage me, and my profession now seems more hopeless than even at C——. But you will understand my allusions better when you have read my letter. You were no doubt agreeably surprised at what appeared our brightened prospects for some months before I left home, and implicitly believed all that I told you about the sale of important works in New York. And when we exchanged our hovel, and our plain, scanty fare for the neat and comfortable little cottage on the mountain-side, with its convenient, not to say elegant, surroundings, you were equally satisfied with the tale I told you about that. It was all a he, Kate. Not the shadow of foundation for one word<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6567-00000087"/> of any of these tales, and I am bowed to the earth with misery and repentance for an act which will haunt the balance of my days. I need not recall to your mind how bitterly I suffered from the villainous conduct of Sharkey (the bitter fruits, in a soured disposition and almost fixed misanthropy, you know but too well), nor how carefully he carried out all his schemes against me; neither need I rehearse to you the many bitter trials to which we have been subjected since our marriage. Suffice it to say, that I became satisfied that with my present advancement as an artist, and with my limited patronage, connected as these difficulties were with the intolerable rascalities of this Argus-eyed villain, starvation was certain.</p>
                  <p>You know that for a long time before I left home I toiled night and day, and executed many pictures for a mere pittance, which should have brought me handsome sums, all to no purpose. One, in particular, you will recollect, for it was a favorite of yours during its whole progress—the scene in the Alleghanies—with the ragged foreground and broken cedars. You will recollect how I labored to give expression to the wounded deer and pursuing hunters, and how often the former was the object of your sympathies. You will remember, too, Kate, that I told you I had sold <emph>this</emph> picture for four hundred dollars, cash. You will excuse the falsehood when I tell you that the motive in telling it was, that you might have no concern about my situation here, or how I acquired means to support you in my absence; all of which will be explained by-and-by. Now listen to the truth: we were living in our cabin, barely provided with the necessaries of life, and the picture, as you know, was executed in an old shed which had formerly been used for a stable. I knew that you were hardly decently provided with clothing, and our children were nearly naked, while our scanty food was scarce enough to sustain life. In the midst of these troubles I toiled night and day to complete this picture, certain that it would bring me a handsome price, if I could only get it into market. You remember the night I finished it. I came to your bed—it was twelve o'clock at night—and I would have you up to see the result of my labor. Oh! how your praises and encomiums did fall like balm upon my wounded soul; and how I did suffer myself to be led away into dream-land by the bright and glorious future you painted for me, while I held the miserable wax light before the picture for your examination! We returned to the hut and sat down before the window; and you remember how we were to use the four hundred dollars which I was to have for the picture. Mary and the boys were to be comfortably and decently clad, and the whole family placed in a better house. Cellars and larder were to be stocked with wholesome food, and I had arrayed my sweet Kate in sundry cheap, but neat and becoming, new dresses. With the residue I was to go to New York, and use every exertion to gain the notice of those who would be willing to aid me.</p>
                  <p>I have told you that Sharkey purchased all the outstanding debts against me that he could lay hands on, and in this way he had accumulated paper against me to the amount of about seven hundred dollars. With these he constantly harassed me, and whenever I completed a picture he would levy upon it with some new judgment which had been rendered against me. On this account I gave up my rooms in the village, where I might soon have attracted the notice of some of the many wealthy visitors from New York and other cities, and commenced painting in the old shed I have mentioned, in the hope that I might complete and sell <emph>one</emph> picture without his knowledge; but I was mistaken. The very next morning after the conversation I have mentioned above, I was in the old shed, weighing in my own mind how I should get the picture to New York, when the constable of the village entered, levied upon it on an execution in favor of Sharkey, and carried it off before my eyes. Paralyzed beyond the power to move, I stood and looked upon him, without uttering a word, as he placed my idol in a cart which stood at a short distance, and then, overcome by this new blow, I burst into a flood of tears which I could not control. I could see plainly enough,<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6567-00000088"/> from the systematic course which Sharkey had pursued, that he was determined to reduce me to beggary, whether for the mere hope of a trifling speculation on my pictures, or for some other and deeper cause, I could not divine. The picture was bought in by Sharkey for seventy-five dollars, but half enough to cover the judgment, and was since sold by him to a gentleman in New York for six hundred. In the mean time we were naked almost, and starving. Something <emph>must</emph> be done. I had no heart nor talent to meet his villainous plans; and as his conduct was so mysterious and inexplicable, I determined to seek an interview with him, and force, if possible, an explanation. The events of the morning convinced me that he had some spy upon my actions—was fully informed of every movement—was determined to keep me so reduced that I could not control my own affairs, and, for some inscrutable purpose, render me a beggar. His systematic course to annoy and distress me I could not understand, as I could not account for it by supposing that it was based upon a desire to make money out of my labor. Pictures, Kate, I have found, to my sorrow, are not in such demand as to warrant large investments in them as a matter of speculation. I sought for a solution of his conduct through all sorts of probable and improbable causes, without being satisfied; and I recollected with a shudder his cold, heartless manner, and his fiendish expression and insulting language whenever I had occasion to speak to him upon business matters. There seemed to be no disposition to respect my situation or feelings; but, on the contrary, he acted always as though he desired to irritate and madden me.</p>
                  <p>With the knowledge of all <emph>these</emph> things, the last act had so outraged me that I determined to visit him again and ask, and, if necessary, beg for an explanation, painful and humiliating as the task might be; and but a few hours had clapsed after the removal of my picture by the officer, when I found myself at the door of Sharkey's office, with my hand upon the knocker, and a thousand emotions warring in my breast. After a moment's pause I rapped, and was ushered into his presence. He was busily engaged at the moment looking over some papers upon a table where he sat, and did not immediately notice my entrance, but went on making some remarks to the clerk who had admitted me, apparently in continuation of some conversation which had been going on previous to my arrival. He raised his eyes at length, and met mine, which were bent full upon him with an unusual expression of sternness. The color forsook his cheek when he recognized me, and a nervous tremor seized upon him to such a degree that he almost lost control of himself, and, hastily collecting the papers before him, he deposited them in a drawer, which he carefully locked, and put the key into his pocket; then turning to me, he asked, with an air of forced composure, the nature of my business.</p>
                  <p>"You can give a pretty shrewd guess what brings me here, Mr. Sharkey," I replied. "Do you wish any one present during our interview?" He turned to the clerk and told him to leave us for a short time; and then thrusting one hand under his vest, and the other deep into his pocket, fixed his eyes firmly upon me, and said: "Now, Mr. Grattan, be as explicit as possible. What is your business with me?"</p>
                  <p>Without noticing his remark, I walked to the door through which the clerk had just passed, and locking it, placed the key in my pocket, and returned to the table where he sat. His whole manner was changed. To my surprise, every vestige of embarrassment was gone, and he coolly asked me to be seated, saying at the same time there was no necessity for locking the door.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Sharkey," I replied, almost off my balance at his changed manner, "you are a lawyer, and no doubt accustomed to dispatch in the management of your business; but I have taken the liberty of locking the door of your office, that you might understand that this interview will not terminate until I say so."</p>
                  <p>"Then, sir," he said, "you may as well replace the key in the door, for you will be quite ready to terminate it when I am."</p>
                  <pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6567-00000089"/>
                  <p>He fixed his eyes upon me when said this, with such a devilish expression as almost staggered me. It satisfied me, too, that he had some hold upon me or mine of which I knew nothing, and for which I was, of course, unprepared. Seeing the embarrassment into which his manner had thrown me, he took advantage of it still further to annoy me by a cool—"Come, sir, <emph>open your case.</emph>"</p>
                  <p>Stung to the soul by his cool sarcasm, and feeling that this was "adding insult to injury," I could scarce resist the temptation to do some act of violence; but I was determined, if possible, to penetrate the motives which actuated him, and I replied with as much calmness as I could command—</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Sharkey, you have this morning levied upon another of my pictures, which I suppose will be sacrificed, as all those have been which have previously fallen into your hands under similar circumstances. It is but natural that I should wish to know the cause of what seems to me a systematic and determined persecution, and I have called to ask an explanation."</p>
                  <p>"Do you not owe me, sir?" he asked in a nervous and excited manner.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir, I do," I replied.</p>
                  <p>"Can you pay me?" he continued crabbedly.</p>
                  <p>"No, sir, not at present."</p>
                  <p>"Then you must not complain, Mr. Grattan, if I <emph>try</emph> to secure myself in my own way."</p>
                  <p>"Now, Mr. Sharkey," I replied, "you have asked me whether I was indebted to you, and I have answered you; now tell me whether the paper you hold against me has been honorably obtained? Has it not been purchased with the express purpose of giving me trouble?"</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Grattan," said he, bending his little snake-like eyes upon me, "I do not feel obliged to disclose my motives to you, and I shall only do so that you need not puzzle your brain too much on my account. I will tell you in few words all that is necessary, and all that you will <unclear>care</unclear> to know. In some business transactions I have purchased certain claims against you, for which I have paid the cash, and I do not feel disposed to lose my money. This is quite simple, and I hope satisfactory."</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Sharkey," I said, returning his fierce look with one no less fierce, for his whole bearing excited me more and more as we proceeded, "Mr. Sharkey, this is short and simple, but it will not do. If you are a prudent business man, knowing, as you must have known, my situation, you would hardly venture to purchase several hundred dollars' worth of claims against <emph>me.</emph> It would be considered by <emph>such a man,</emph> at least, not a safe venture." I tried to speak calmly, but my voice trembled with the indignation I felt, the more I thought of his past conduct, and notwithstanding my angry look and trembling articulation, he replied, coolly:</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Grattan, this is simple nonsense. If I choose to buy claims against you, and run the risk of securing them, why not do so as well as against any other man? It may be as you intimate, a greater risk, but this is my own affair."</p>
                  <p>"Do you intend me to understand that you are simply acting the part of a broker or shaver, and that these claims against me are bought as a matter of speculation? I don't believe it, Mr. Sharkey! It is not probable, or possible! It would be acting neither with the sense nor shrewdness for which you have credit."</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Grattan," he cried, starting to his feet and moving his hands nervously under his vest, "do you insinuate that I am telling you a falsehood?"</p>
                  <p>"God knows, Mr. Sharkey, whether you are or not," I replied, as calmly as I could; "I <emph>insinuate</emph> nothing, but it does not seem reasonable that you should pay cash for claims to a large amount against a man who can hardly raise the means to support his family, and whose profession <emph>you</emph> have sense enough to know is too precarious to base any such venture upon as <emph>that.</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"If you are the pauper that you acknowledge yourself to be, Mr. Grattan, it is no fault of mine. I buy your paper as I would buy the paper of any other man. If you choose to daub and dabble in colors, starving yourself and family, it is<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6567-00000090"/> no reason why you should not be made to pay your debts like other men."</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Sharkey!" I exclaimed, full of excitement, and convinced that he was shuffling with me, "I will not bear these insults, and for your own sake I beg of you to beware how you license your tongue. I am almost desperate, and you know that your course has crippled all my efforts to such an extent that I can scarcely find means to live. If I <emph>am</emph> a pauper, Mr. Sharkey, <emph>you</emph> have made me so, and I will, contrary to every impulse of my being, humble myself so far as to beg, even, to know why it is so? I have never, to my knowledge, done you any harm, or given the least cause for such conduct as you exhibit. If you have purchased these claims, as you intimate, as a matter of speculation, you must have got them at a large discount, and you can well afford to give me time to meet them. My pictures are worth much more than you are buying them for."</p>
                  <p>"Certainly they are, Mr. Grattan," he replied, with a cool insolence that utterly confounded me, "and it is just this that pays me for the extra risk I run in buying them. All the world are speculators—every man tries to secure his fortune in his own way, and it is neither your business nor mine to question his course, so long as he keeps within the pale of the law. The merchant singes the farmer, and the farmer, when he gets the opportunity, returns the compliment. The mechanic slights his work whenever he can do so and avoid detection, and thus reaps a larger profit on his labor. The lawyer," he added, with a fiendish laugh and a flashing eye, "preys upon them all, Mr. Grattan."</p>
                  <p>"Great God!" I replied, "is it possible that human nature can be so debased? Pray, sir, in Heaven's name tell me what I am to understand from all this; I am in your power, and—</p>
                  <p>"And—" he said, taking up the word from my mouth, setting his teeth, and eying me with a fierce, hungry look, "<emph>and</emph>—I intend to keep you there until I get my money."</p>
                  <p>"At the risk of starving me and my family, Mr. Sharkey?"</p>
                  <p>"At all risks, Mr. Grattan," he coolly answered; "and as I have other pressing business this morning, I hope you will see the propriety of trespassing no longer upon my time."</p>
                  <p>Paralyzed, crushed, mortified, enraged almost to stupefaction, I walked mechanically to the door, placed the key in the lock, slowly drew back the bolt, opened the door, and stepping out closed it after me. To such a pitch of excitement was I wrought, that I have no recollection of the passage of time; but when reason once more assumed her throne I found myself on the shore of the lake, a mile from the village, my feet hurrying along as if to keep pace with the wild emotions which thronged upon my brain. I only wonder now, when I look back upon these events, that Sharkey did not fall a victim <emph>then</emph> to the rage which he had excited in my bosom. But it had reached the pitch of insanity and stupefaction, and this saved him. Cooled by a gentle breeze which swept over the lake, I sat down upon a rock to deliberate as calmly as possible upon my situation. I was stung to the soul by the sarcasm of the villain who thus deliberately tortured me, and my pride had received a wound from which it could not soon recover. What aggravated this feeling much was the fact, that I could but acknowledge, that as the world would view the case, I was just in the position that Sharkey so sarcastically placed me.</p>
                  <p>I <emph>was</emph> a pauper in every sense of the word, and the law gave him as perfect a right to oppress me as any other man. I knew I had not fathomed his motive, for his whole conduct convinced me that this he kept carefully concealed for purposes of his own. I blamed myself, Kate, that I had been the means of dragging you from a position in which you might have been happy, to taste the cup of bitterness with <emph>me;</emph> that I had been the means of throwing a mildew of care and sorrow over <emph>your</emph> young heart, and had brought a blight upon your prospects which could not be removed. In short, I persuaded myself that I was just the miserable creature Sharkey had insinuated, and I will not say that mortified pride had nothing to do with the resolution I formed, for I felt keenly his insults in regard to my profession, and a stern determination to<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6567-00000091"/> adhere to it at all hazards and <emph>make</emph> it gain for me an honorable name and position.</p>
                  <p>Oh! how bitterly I cursed the fate that had reduced me to such a point of poverty and wretchedness as to make me the subject of the scorching insults which had been heaped upon me by this miserable wretch! Suffice it to say, dear Kate, I came to the determination to leave you, in the hope of doing better—to leave my home, and trust to God for the future. I felt now like an outcast, or some prowling thief, against whom every man's hand is turned, and a bitter hatred toward all human kind fastened itself upon my heart. I resolved to visit Sharkey again, and go on my knees, if necessary, to persuade him to permit me to leave C—— upon this mission, without pursuing me farther, for I well knew that without this consent he would not scruple to take the last crumb from our mouths.</p>
                  <p>I determined now to devote every energy to place myself in a position of honorable independence, and I did not look beyond this. Fame, independence, were now written in my brain, and I thought of nothing else. What <emph>you</emph> might suffer, Kate, from being left alone and destitute, never entered my head, and I took no thought of the unpleasant situation in which you would be placed by the step which I proposed. I only had one feeling, one impulse, and that was a determination to place myself in a position where no human brute like this could ever again have the power, if he felt the disposition, to control me, or deprive me of my freedom to act and feel like one of God's creatures, rather than a sneaking cur that every man considers it his privilege to kick.</p>
                  <p>Full of these feelings, I hastily arose and commenced slowly to retrace my steps toward the village, revolving in my mind how I should meet Sharkey the second time. It was now evening, and a gloom began to settle upon the old chestnut forest, in perfect accordance with my feelings, and as I walked slowly forward, the past interview with him was turned and returned in my mind, until I had wrought myself a second time into a perfect frenzy. I was aroused from my meditations by the sound of rapid steps coming through the wood, and looking forward through the gloom I saw a figure hastily approaching on the path toward Grey's cottage, on the border of the lake. A few steps revealed to me the form of Sharkey! Oh! Kate, what fiend could have turned his steps in this direction at such a time? Was it <emph>fate,</emph> or merely accident, that threw him across my path at this moment? Heaven only knows. But I will hasten over this interview and its termination, which has filled my bitter cup to the brim, and left no room for another drop. The thought now came upon me, "Here I have him alone in this lonely wood, and he can not escape me. I will <emph>force</emph> his secret from him." How I should force it from him did not occur to me. When we met he did not evince so much surprise as I anticipated, and the thought flashed through my mind that he had watched and followed me, and I am since fully convinced that such was the fact. With as steady a voice as I could command, I said to him:</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Sharkey, I am glad to meet you again; I was just on my return to the village to seek another interview with you upon the subject recently under consideration between us, and accident has brought us together where we shall not be interrupted; but I warn you in advance that I shall not quietly listen to a repetition of such language as you used to me on that occasion."</p>
                  <p>"I am not apt," he replied, "to study my language, and generally use such as pleases myself. You can, however, say what you have to say, and I shall reply as I see fit."</p>
                  <p>I walked up close to him, as he said this, and looking him sternly in the eye, said, "Mr. Sharkey, your air of bravado will produce no effect upon me here, and it is impossible for you <emph>now</emph> to avoid direct answers to certain questions which I shall propound to you. In doing so, I beg of you again to use no language which shall aggravate my already excited feelings; if you do, upon your own head be the consequences."</p>
                  <p>"You are multiplying words unnecessarily," he replied, "and will save time by coming at once to the point. What have you to ask?"</p>
                  <pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC6567-00000092"/>
                  <p>"In the first place, then, sir, your persecution of me is a mystery which you <emph>must</emph> explain. I do not believe that it is alone the result of a disposition to make money, as you claim. You know quite well that if I could sell my pictures myself, in my own way, I should soon, in all probability, be able to pay off the claims you hold against me. I could, at least, gradually do this, and at the same time fulfill my obligations to my family. You have set your spies upon me, to seize upon my works, and force a sale upon them, when there was not the least necessity for it, and you have now placed me in a position where I can neither pay you nor any one else. I will not work <emph>here</emph> while you pursue such a course. Thank God, you can not force me to do that! and how are you then to replace the money you have invested in these claims?"</p>
                  <p>"Trust me for this, Grattan," he said, still in the most insulting manner, "I will find means to bring you to terms."</p>
                  <p>"And how, Mr. Sharkey?"</p>
                  <p>"I will take the last piece of furniture in your house, if necessary; and to convince you that I am in earnest, I have sent the constable, since I saw you, to levy upon the pictures you have there, to satisfy a judgment rendered in my favor on the Carter notes."</p>
                  <p>This announcement, Kate, exasperated me beyond all control. I had humbled myself before the villain, time after time, to prevent him from taking any step which should add to your misery; and knowing my anxiety to hide from you the extent of our poverty, he now, in my very teeth, with an exultant air, tells me that he has sent an officer into my house, to fill my family with alarm and mortification—an event which he well knew I would have given my right hand to avoid. I found on my return home that he had lied to me, most likely for the express purpose of exciting me to act as I did. I turned upon him and exclaimed, "Sharkey, if you have done this, you are a brute and a villain. I had intended to ask your permission to go to New York, to try to secure the means not only to pay you, but to relieve my family; but since you have pursued this villainous course, you can now go on and empty my house, turn my family into the street—so help me God, I will never pay you another cent! You are a heartless villain! move on, before I am led to do you some harm." I stepped aside to let him pass, but instead of doing so, he rushed upon me with a drawn knife, and made a desperate lunge full at my breast. I caught the blow upon my left arm, and with my right I struck him with all my force upon the forehead, and he fell backward with a groan, while I recovered myself to meet a second attack, not wishing to follow up my advantage, and determined to act solely on the defensive. To my astonishment he did not stir. I ventured to approach him cautiously, thinking that this was only a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ruse</foreign> to bring me nearer to him, that he might make surer work with his knife. As I drew near him, I discovered his knife lying upon the ground, and then for the first time I became alarmed, and rushed frantically forward, knelt beside him, and raised his head to my knee. I called him; no answer. I tore off his cravat—bared his bosom—placed my hand upon his heart—O God! Kate—not a throb answered my search; he was dead! I clasped my hands to my forehead, and dashed wildly through the wood, it being now nearly dark, blind to everything around me, until, overcome by my feelings, I fell prostrate upon the earth, where I remained I know not how long. When I recovered my consciousness I got to my feet and looked around me with a bewildered gaze, and the moon was now shining down through the dense foliage, lighting up here and there the white trunks of the old chestnut trees, which seemed to my excited mind like specters come to reprove me for my guilt. Suddenly the thought came, that Sharkey's body was yet lying in the path where I had left it; that the crime had been committed without witnesses; that in case I should divulge the whole affair, the fact of our former difficulties would tell strongly against me; and finally, that my own safety was in concealing the body and removing all evidences of our struggle.</p>
                  <p>I hurriedly retraced my steps, and as I approached the spot, I looked out upon the little open space where our meeting<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6567-00000093"/> had occurred, which was now lighted up by the moon, and to my horror I found that the body was gone! whether removed by some one who had been passing that way, or whether he had recovered and gone away himself, where the questions which now almost made me frantic. I looked eagerly about on all sides; ran into the wood again on both sides of the path, searching everywhere in vain. At length I ventured to call to him, but my voice died away in echoes through the silent wood; and as the last sound fell upon my ear, I shall never forget the sensations I felt. I sat down upon a log to try to collect myself, and if possible arrive at the most probable explanation of this mystery. That he was not within sound of my voice, and alive, was quite certain; and it was then equally certain that he had sufficiently recovered to find his own way out of the wood, or had been removed by others. This last reflection filled me with terror, for I felt that I would be at any time subject to arrest and trial, should suspicion fasten upon me; and the disgrace which would be visited upon you, Kate, and my children, in such an event, filled me with alarm, and my next impulse was to fly the country. Further consideration, however, satisfied me that this would certainly bring about all that I wished to avoid. Suddenly the thought occurred to me that he might have recovered and found his way back to the village, and I determined to satisfy myself that this was the case. I accordingly struck into the wood, crossed the mountain, and reached home by a new route from the one by which I had entered it. It was now nearly ten o'clock, and I visited the hotel where Sharkey boarded, and every other place where he was in the habit of spending any time; but in none of these did I hear his name mentioned, nor was there the least sign of excitement, as there would have been if he had been brought home dead; and it now only remained to learn whether he had come home himself. To ascertain this fact I went to his office, but there was no light there; and when (pushed to desperation, I determined to arouse Sharkey if he was in) I knocked repeatedly at the front door, I received no answer. I returned home in a frame of mind bordering on insanity, and you met me with a sweet smile and a warm kiss at the door, and noticing my extreme perturbation, asked a thousand questions as to the cause, to which I gave vague and unsatisfactory answers. I hoped, however, when morning came, to hear something which would confirm the hope I still entertained, that Sharkey had escaped and was yet living.</p>
                  <p>What was my consternation, then, when on going to Coldwell next morning, I found the whole population in excitement, and heard from a dozen different persons that Sharkey <emph>and Sharpe</emph> had both disappeared; that nothing remained in the office; everything having been removed in the night, and that there was a strong suspicion that there had been foul play. At this news I was more than ever confounded, but it still left me the hope that he might not be dead, and I only found myself more and more bewildered, the more I tried to penetrate the causes which could have led to such an inexplicable piece of conduct on the part of Sharpe. My mind was somewhat relieved, however, when I found that suspicion generally attached to Sharpe where violence to Sharkey was suspected; but there was a growing belief that they had, from some unknown cause, ran away together. I was relieved by all this from much of my apprehension; but conscience was not yet satisfied, and the mental torture still continued. To all outward seeming, Sharkey was dead when I left him; and so long as there was doubt as to what had become of his body, I could only look upon myself as a murderer. Kate, I have so looked upon myself from that moment to this, and so long as this terrible mystery is unexplained, I must continue to do so. But I must bring this horrible narrative to a close.</p>
                  <p>A few days after the encounter, I was walking in the wood near the place where it occurred, toward which my steps seemed to be turned by some fatality, and had for the hundredth time searched in every direction for some clew to Sharkey, when, on emerging from the wood, upon the path<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6567-00000094"/> which led back to the village, I suddenly met old Grey, the fisherman. I was in such an excited frame of mind that he must have noticed it; but without saying a word he took me by the arm mysteriously, and led me by a by-path deep into the forest. After walking on for some time, he at length stopped beside a large, moss-covered stone, and asked me to be seated. During this time I had been trembling with alarm, and the large drops had gathered upon my forehead. His strange manner, his caution, his silence, had all surprised and alarmed me; and when he told me to be seated, I mechanically obeyed, satisfied that he was about to make some important communication to me, and my ready fears already suggested to my mind what it was to be. After looking cautiously around, to satisfy himself that no one was near us, he at length approached me and said, in a voice scarcely above a whisper—</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Grattan, I was an unwilling witness of the encounter between you and Sharkey a few nights since."</p>
                  <p>As the old man spoke these words, it seemed as if my heart had ceased to beat, and it was only with a great effort that I could ask him what had become of Sharkey's body.</p>
                  <p>"When you ran into the woods," he answered, "seeing that you had left the body in the path to be found by any passer-by, and not wishing that you should be subjected to arrest until I could see you and converse with you upon the subject, I went forward after you had gone, took up the body, and secreted it myself."</p>
                  <p>"Great God!" I cried, starting to my feet, "and <emph>you</emph> are living to bear testimony against me!" "Not against you," he replied, "but <emph>for you,</emph> if necessary. I witnessed the whole scene (unfortunately everything transpired too suddenly for any interference on my part to prevent the sad result); and I can testify that you acted in self-defense. But your running away from the body, and your silence upon the subject since, will tell seriously against you before a jury; and in these particulars you have acted very foolishly."</p>
                  <p>"You are undoubtedly right, Grey," I answered; "but I acted alone from my fears, which completely stifled my reason. It is now too late to remedy that. But tell me," I said, "where you have secreted Sharkey's body, and go with me to the place, that I may have no doubt that he is really dead."</p>
                  <p>"Not for the world," he hastily exclaimed, "would I show you where his body is concealed, as the risk you would run, if you should by accident be seen there, and the body afterward be discovered, would make it an act of blind and inconsiderate folly. I will tell you, however, that the body is secreted not far from where you met, and there is but little danger that it will be discovered if you act with ordinary prudence."</p>
                  <p>"Did you know that Sharpe was gone, too, Mr. Grey?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I heard of this some days since," he replied; "and although I do not put the same interpretation upon <emph>his</emph> conduct that many others do, I think him even a greater rascal than his master was; and his disappearance just at that time, no doubt, grew out of some villainous scheme of his own, which may or may not in time be revealed. But I did not seek this interview to harrow up your feelings by a reference to these mysterious events, but rather to counsel with you about your future movements. I am now, perhaps, the only living creature who knows where the body is concealed, and you will not suffer from any fears of discovery if, as I advise, you act with caution."</p>
                  <p>"Well, Grey," I replied, "God knows I need counsel and advice, for my mind seems a perfect wreck, and I have scarcely known what has occurred since that fatal evening. There seem to be many things connected with this affair that ought to be explained; but I confess my inability to investigate, even if it were not dangerous to do so. What do you advise?"</p>
                  <p>"Listen!" the old man said, laying his hand upon my arm. "You have expected to start to New York about this time, and, if possible, start thence for Europe. Everybody here<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6567-00000095"/> is acquainted with this resolve. Now get yourself ready, without seeming in too great haste, and leave as soon as you can."</p>
                  <p>"But what necessity for this," I replied, "if you can testify so positively as to the facts of the encounter? Better by far to acknowledge everything and surrender myself for trial."</p>
                  <p>"By no means," Grey hurriedly exclaimed. "I have the very best reasons for what I advise, and your future welfare and happiness depend upon your following that advice. Upon the ground where you had the meeting with Mr. Sharkey, I found this knife and these two documents," said he, pulling them from his pocket. "One is a written lease of the property in which you now live, from which he intended, no doubt, at the expiration of your present term, to eject you without giving you notice; and the other I shall preserve myself, for reasons of my own."</p>
                  <p>What could I do, Kate? I felt sure, from the whole conduct and bearing of Grey, that there was some powerful motive at the bottom, which he purposely concealed from me, that led him to give this advice; and when he stopped speaking, I leaned forward upon my hands and remained for a long time trying to penetrate his purposes. I could no longer doubt that Sharkey was dead, neither could I doubt that he was for some cause more anxious to keep the fact a secret than I was; for had I acted from my own impulses, I should have immediately given myself up for trial, and, if possible, establish my innocence of any premeditated violence upon Sharkey. He must have, I concluded, some interest in Sharkey, or why so careful to secure the papers he had shown me, and, why use that expression in regard to the one he had retained: "this one I shall preserve for reasons of my own?" As this thought struck me, I raised my head again, and looking the old man full in the face, asked: "Have you any particular interest in Sharkey, Mr. Grey?"</p>
                  <p>He started, for an instant, at this question, and colored slightly, but replied frankly: "I have, Mr. Grattan, I tell you candidly, the greatest interest in unraveling certain mysteries with which this man has been connected, and if you pursue the step you propose now, there is but little hope that I shall succeed. Hence my advice to you to leave this neighborhood for the present. <emph>You</emph> are not safe here a moment, Mr. Grattan," he added, with emphasis; "and on <emph>your own account</emph> it is better that you leave for a time, at least."</p>
                  <p>"What could have been Sharkey's motive," I still persisted, "in such unprovoked persecution of me? I never, to my knowledge, Mr. Grey, gave him the slightest offense."</p>
                  <p>"We have no time to investigate <emph>these</emph> matters now," he answered, evasively, and, I thought, with some embarrassment in his manner. "The time will come for that when you have more leisure. At present, you must hasten your preparations to leave for New York, until the curiosity (for it is little else) about Sharkey's disappearance has subsided."</p>
                  <p>"Alas!" I exclaimed, "I have no means to do this. Sharkey's last levy has taken from me the only picture for which I could realize a sufficient amount for that purpose, and I have no other resource."</p>
                  <p>"Never mind that; never mind that, Mr. Grattan," he replied. You will excuse me for the liberty I have taken, but I have been much interested in you from what I have heard from your friends; and having learned that you were desirous of visiting New York to avail yourself of the advantages there offered for the study of your art, I appealed to a number of your friends, and secured a loan for you of three hundred dollars, which is already deposited in the village bank, subject to your order."</p>
                  <p>I did not thank him, Kate, for this generous act, although I felt as much, and should have expressed as much gratitude as any man could have done under similar circumstances, had not my whole mind been filled with curiosity and wonder, first, to understand why he had taken so much pains to do me a kindness, who had hardly ever before spoken to him; second, why he should evince so much nervous anxiety to have me go to New York, when he had acknowledged to me himself that his own testimony would clear me of the charge<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6567-00000096"/> of willful murder. He watched me curiously while these thoughts were passing through my mind, but finally interrupted them by asking if I was displeased with the course he had taken.</p>
                  <p>"Oh, no! Mr. Grey," I replied, "I feel under great obligations to you for your kindness—I should like to go to New York, but it must not be to avoid an investigation, should Sharkey's body be found, and suspicion fix on me. Indeed, since you have it in your power to clear me, I am strongly inclined to do now what I should have done at the time—acknowledge my guilt and give myself up for trial."</p>
                  <p>"No, no, Mr. Grattan!" he exclaimed, eagerly, and placing his hand upon my shoulder, "this will never do; think of the effect upon your family, and upon <emph>yourself,</emph> from such an investigation." Then suddenly checking himself, seeing my eyes riveted eagerly and inquiringly upon him, he continued, in a changed voice: "Mr. Grattan, I wish I could open my heart to you [he paused again and looked upon the ground], but it can not be yet. No, no!" he added, abstractedly, "you <emph>must</emph> go to New York, Mr. Grattan; it may be of vast importance to you to act under my advice. You <emph>must</emph> do as I say—I have the most powerful and cogent reasons, which I can not now reveal to you. Sharkey's body must be left just where it is until a certain time, which I will indicate to you, after which you can act, Mr. Grattan, as you please, and I will testify to your innocence. You have the means secured by the loan I have mentioned, to defray your expenses to New York and support your family until you begin to realize something for your labor. Suspicion has settled upon no one in regard to Sharkey's disappearance, and you can leave without exciting any within the coming ten days."</p>
                  <p>Kate! I looked at the old man in perfect surprise and astonishment. He seemed suddenly transformed into a different being. His language, manner—all were different—and revealed to me a hidden character which I had never before seen in him. I felt, I can not tell why, that my fate was in his hands, and I gave my consent to act as he advised. I was impressed with the mysterious manner of the old man, and could not fail to remark that there appeared something strangely inconsistent in his conduct in regard to the subject of our conversation; but my mind was a chaos, and I could not think for myself, but submitted blindly to his guidance, feeling quite certain that for <emph>some</emph> cause he was my friend, and was doing what he considered best for me.</p>
                  <p>We parted, and I returned home to prepare for my departure. I need not recur to the events of the few days previous; you well remember all. The tissue of falsehoods I told you in regard to our mended prospects, and my manner of accounting to you for the money I gave you before I left—all this will come fresh to your mind now. Suffice it to say, I am wretched—I am ruined; happiness on this earth is no more for me! But bitter, oh! how bitter is the reflection, that my hand has sent a fellow-creature, unwashed of his sins, into the presence of his Judge, however conscious I may be of my innocence of any criminal <emph>intentions.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have but one consolation to support me in all this misery—and that is, the reflection that you and the dear little ones at home are provided for until the success of my efforts here is known, and you need have no hesitation about using the money deposited in the bank to my credit as you may need it, for I have had some intimation that I shall have commissions to the full amount of thedeposit.</p>
                  <p>Now, dear Kate, this sad narrative is concluded. Oh! I can feel sensibly how terrible this blow will be to you, and it is rendered more severe from the fact that I can say nothing to give you hope. Pray for me, Kate. I need your prayers, and I feel certain that if prayers avail anything in heaven, yours will be answered. Convey my choicest blessings to our dear children. Kiss them a thousand times for their poor father; but, for God's sake, keep them in ignorance of the crime which has plunged him in misery for life. I shall write to you again, very soon. Forgive me, sweet wife, for the terrible suffering I have brought upon you, but, believe me, as ever, affectionately,</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
               <head type="sub">SHARKEY'S WHEREABOUTS—GLIMPSES OF THE MYSTERY—SCENE IN THE CAVE.</head>
               <p>WE must turn back in our story and detail certain events which have occurred since the encounter between Grattan and Sharkey near old Grey's. On that evening Grey was returning home from the village, when, as we have learned from his statement to Grattan, he was a witness to what passed between them, and would have interfered to prevent violence, had not everything transpired too suddenly for such interference to be of any avail.</p>
               <p>When Grattan left the body and hurried into the woods, Grey, about to run up to the place, was deterred by the sight of another figure approaching rapidly on the path from the direction of the village, and stood breathlessly watching his movements until he advanced into the little open space where Sharkey was lying, and stooped over him with gesticulations of surprise and alarm. Recognizing Sharpe, Grey, approaching him hastily and cautiously, sprung suddenly upon him and seized him by the collar before he was aware of his presence. Sharpe, bereft almost of his reason by this unexpected occurrence, and fearing, perhaps, that Grey suspected him of the violence upon Sharkey, commenced with great excitement and volubility excusing himself, and charging the deed upon Grattan, who, he said, pointing in the direction where he had disappeared, "has just run into the woods."</p>
               <p>"There is no time to be lost now," said Grey, himself almost as wild and incoherent as Sharpe; "I have seen it all. Assist me immediately in conveying your master to my hut; there will be time enough to explain this matter afterward."</p>
               <p>Thus peremptorily directed, Sharpe caught hold of Sharkey, and the two raised him up and bore him forward rapidly in the direction of Grey's, without passing another word. Once there, they carried him into the inner room and laid him upon a bed; they then returned to the outer one, and while Sharpe was looking curiously and with a crest-fallen air about him, Grey secured the door, and turning around, walked directly up to him, and taking him again by the collar, thrust him forcibly into a seat, and hurriedly exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"Now, Sharpe, tell me instantly—for there is no time to be lost—why this thing has been done. Quick, sir!" he added, as the other hesitated and stammered; "there is not a moment's time to spare, as Sharkey must be attended to immediately. No subterfuge; but tell me the truth on the instant. I know you both, Sharpe, and you may as well understand at once that I am not to be dallied with or deceived."</p>
               <p>"Well, old chap," Sharpe replied, trying to recover himself by a show of insolence, which he intended should pass for self-possession, "you might as well save your breath. I don't know anything—"</p>
               <p>"Stop, Sharpe!" Grey exclaimed, angrily; "don't lie to me; I will deliver you over to an officer within an hour, if you do not answer me truly. And that you need not prevaricate or shuffle any further, you must know who I am."</p>
               <p>At the end of this sentence he stooped to Sharpe's ear, while he was staring at him with a wild look of inquiry, and whispered something to him which made him start first to his feet, and then stagger, with his eyes glaring wildly at him to the opposite wall, whither Grey followed him, and repeated, in determined accents, "Now, you villain, will you answer my question?"</p>
               <p>"Mr. ——!" Sharpe commenced, hardly able to speak audibly; but before he could utter another word, Grey clapped his hand upon his mouth suddenly, and cried—</p>
               <p>"Call no names, Sharpe, but answer my question."</p>
               <pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6567-00000098"/>
               <p>"I can not answer it, sir, upon my honor," the trembling wretch replied, crouching against the wall. "Mr. Sharkey and Mr. Grattan had a private interview at the office this afternoon, but I was sent out, and know nothing about it."</p>
               <p>"What were you doing in the woods, Sharpe?" Grey asked, sternly.</p>
               <p>At this question the man faltered for a moment, and then replied, that Mr. Sharkey and himself were simply taking an evening walk in the woods, and that when they saw Mr. Grattan approaching, Mr. Sharkey told him to step one side, as he wished to have a few words in private with him, and walked forward to meet him.</p>
               <p>"Is this true, Sharpe?"</p>
               <p>"Upon my honor, sir, every word."</p>
               <p>"Well, sir," said Grey, hurriedly, "whether it be so, or not, I am sure I can not tell; but I tell you, candidly, I suspect you for a villain, and I know enough of your former life to convict you. Now, sir, go back to the village, and bring me from there all Sharkey's papers this night. Pack up the balance of his effects, and take them with you. I will furnish you with means to take you to England, and you must vanish from this neighborhood before daylight. Promise me this, and I let you go; otherwise I will have you put in irons, and <emph>sent.</emph>"</p>
               <p>While Grey was speaking, Sharpe's nervous excitement was excessive, and he could not meet the eye of the excited old man, but hung his head like a culprit; and when he had finished, he promised everything that was required of him, and Grey continued—</p>
               <p>"Now, then, one word more, Sharpe: you are not to mention to a living creature a word of this interview, or of what has befallen Sharkey. I can not think that he is dead, and must take immediate measures for his resuscitation. You can now go," he added, as he walked forward and unlocked the door, "and return to me with the papers as soon as possible."</p>
               <p>Sharpe sighed heavily at this, as if relieved of a load of apprehension, and the moment the door was opened, darted out and disappeared. Grey then hurriedly returned to Sharkey key, who, by the time he reached him, was already breathing heavily and with great difficulty, at which evidences of returning animation Grey evinced the most extravagant joy. He ran to the lake and brought cool fresh water, with which he copiously bathed Sharkey's head, continuing the process for some time, and bursting into new exclamations of joy, as his efforts seemed to give promise that Sharkey would be restored to reason and the wretched man yet be saved. He stooped over him and spoke to him, frequently calling him by a name new to all those who were acquainted with him in the neighborhood, but receiving neither answer nor the slightest sign that he was either heard or understood.</p>
               <p>At length, in the midst of these exertions on the part of Grey, Sharpe returned, and as he entered the outer room, Grey joined him, received the papers which he had brought according to promise, and after giving him a sufficient amount to pay his expenses to England, and renewing his cautions as to secrecy, with many threats and references to some past occurrences with which he seemed to be familiar, he dismissed him and returned to Sharkey, who, when he again approached the bed, was slowly turning his head from side to side, with an expression of pain upon his countenance; and when Grey again spoke to him, opened his eyes and gazed wildly about him until they finally settled upon the face of the old man, who bent over him, watching with the most eager interest every movement.</p>
               <p>Sharkey's eyes continued fixed upon the old man's face for some minutes with a stare, intense and inquiring, and with a peculiar expression—half insane, half reason—until at length, while yet this struggle was going on between the two, he passed his hand several times across his eyes, as if to clear a doubtful vision, and muttered to himself, in broken sentences, words which Grey eagerly stooped forward to hear: "This is strange," he said, pausing for a moment and looking vacantly about the place; "Sharpe, where are you? didn't I tell you to stand there?" And he raised himself partly upon his elbow and gazed wistfully into the gloom with a wild,<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6567-00000099"/> uncertain look for a moment; and then, falling back upon his pillow, continued again, while Grey stepped cautiously to the bedside to catch his words: "Oh, my God! where am I? I must be mad, or hurt, or perhaps—oh! no, this can not be!" he added, as some fearful thought passed through his mind, "not that—yet—but—" again trying to raise himself up; "where is Sharpe and Grattan?" And then, as if a ray of memory had struck upon his brain, and again vanished, he uttered in chilling tones, while he struggled with all his strength to get off the bed, Grey resisting him, "Oh, he's dead! or perhaps <emph>I am</emph> dead, and this is"—and he stopped here suddenly again, and putting both hands before his eyes, fell back a second time exhausted, with exclamations which gradually died upon his lips, and while his whole body trembled until the bed shook under him. "Oh, this is terrible! I shall die here, with no one to care for me! Oh, my head! my head!"</p>
               <p>His voice ceased, and he remained motionless without other signs of life than a heavy, sonorous breathing, his countenance purple with the rush of blood to his head; and Grey was warned by these appearances that no time was to be lost. Looking at him a moment, while tears moistened his eyes, he murmured to himself: "This place I had prepared for you, but did not expect to find you here under such circumstances;" and hastily leaving the house, after locking the inner and outer doors, he ran forward at his greatest speed to the village.</p>
               <p>At a late hour that same night, Grey and Dr. Draper were in close conversation in the outer room of the hut, where they remained for some hours—the Doctor having first bled Sharkey, and applied other remedies that were producing the desired effect, and having seen that the most dangerous symptoms had very considerably abated.</p>
               <p>Still an hour later, Grey said to him, on parting with him at the door: "Doctor, the secret of a heart-broken father is in your keeping. I could not secure your professional services without these revelations. You no doubt fully appreciate my motives, and will carefully guard my secret."</p>
               <p>"Trust me, Mr. Grey; no excitement which may grow out of the occurrences of the past night shall lead me to divulge one word that has been spoken to me to-night, unless Grattan should be arrested and my evidence is necessary to save him."</p>
               <p>"I should, in that event, come forward myself," said Grey; "but I do not anticipate that suspicion will fix upon him."</p>
               <p>"Trust me, then," the Doctor replied, greatly moved, "under every other circumstance."</p>
               <p>"Thank you," Grey answered; "you will also remember, Doctor, to call every night, at twelve, until he is out of danger."</p>
               <p>"I will be here at twelve, promptly;" and mounting his horse, which was standing at a short distance, the Doctor rode back toward the village.</p>
               <p>In ten days from this time, while the public excitement was most intense in regard to the mysterious disappearance of Sharkey, and within which time the woods, the fields, and even the lake, were searched, for some clew by which to come at the truth, Doctor Draper and Grey were constant and unremitting in their attentions upon him. At the end of this time they were again together in secret council at the hut, and after a long conversation, carried on in low voices, the Doctor announced to Grey that Sharkey would need no further aid from him, and would probably recover, with careful nursing. "And I am gratified," said he, "to learn that no one has been arrested, and that the whole affair will be forgotten with the 'Mysterious Disappearance,' which has been published in the papers, with editorial comments, all over the country."</p>
               <p>"Do you think, Doctor," said Grey, "that reason is fairly restored, and that it will now be safe for me to make the disclosures to him that I spoke of?"</p>
               <p>"His reason is restored," the Doctor replied, "but any excitement may bring about a return of his malady, which was first brought on in that way, and not, I am satisfied, by the blow received from Grattan. It will be best, therefore,<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6567-00000100"/> to make no disclosures which will cause any excitement, for some days yet; and you must carefully disguise yourself whenever you are in his presence. Poor Grattan," he continued, "the worst feature of the case now is, that <emph>he</emph> has left, under the supposition that he has committed a murder, and the mental torture which he must endure should be alleviated as soon as possible."</p>
               <p>"You are acquainted with my motives in advising him to leave," said Grey, "and rest assured I will in good time compensate him for all that he has suffered, and restore him to his family."</p>
               <p>"I can not find fault with your manner of accomplishing your object," the Doctor answered, "singular and extraordinary as are the means you have employed, and shall rejoice with you in your hopes are well grounded and success crowns your efforts."</p>
               <p>"Of this I am somewhat in doubt, Doctor; but it is better that I should try this course to satisfy myself whether my suspicions are correct, as well as to reform his character. I can not leave him to terminate his mad career in a manner which would cover me with eternal disgrace and sorrow; nor can I be satisfied until the other matter is probed to the bottom. The sacrifices I have already made will be proof to you of my solicitude upon this subject; and, although I strongly sympathize with you in your feeling for Grattan, a few months' banishment for him, in the belief that he has committed a deadly crime even, would not, I believe, swerve you from your determination, if you were in my place."</p>
               <p>"It would not, Mr. Grey; and I pray God that your efforts to conceal your nephew's past crimes and prevent the commission of others, as well as to satisfy your mind upon the subject you have most at heart, may prove entirely successful. You will, of course, consider it your duty to see that neither Grattan nor his family suffer in the mean time."</p>
               <p>"I have done all that I can at present do, Doctor, without raising suspicions and exciting hopes which may never be gratified. I will do all that I dare do at present."</p>
               <p>Satisfied with these assurances, the Doctor bade him good-night, and left him to his meditations.</p>
               <p>Two weeks now passed by, during which Grey had been the only attendant upon Sharkey, who had entirely recovered. He had already began to chafe and fret, and sometimes storm at his confinement, which he every day called upon Grey to explain, and the latter had at length determined to do so.</p>
               <p>On the evening to which we now call the attention of the reader, the old man had returned from the village, where he had been making some necessary purchases; and on entering the house he took unusual pains in securing the door, and drawing the rude curtains across the windows. He sat down, and was for some time buried in reflection. At length, as if his mind were settled as to his course, he arose, and going to a large chest which stood upon one side of the room, opened it and commenced taking out various articles of clothing, little in keeping with his assumed character. First, a coat of fine broadcloth; then a pair of pantaloons of the same material; a costly velvet vest; a hat, and all that belonged to the outward indications of the gentleman. These had evidently been long concealed from sight, and the old man evinced much excitement, as one by one they were brought to light. He next proceeded to shave himself carefully, and removed portions of a long and untrimmed beard, which materially changed his appearance.</p>
               <p>While engaged in this operation a violent pounding was heard in that portion of this singular abode where Sharkey was confined.</p>
               <p>"What is your will?" said Grey, approaching the door.</p>
               <p>"My will! in the name of ten thousand devils! you old rascal, will you continue so coolly to ask me my will? If ever I am released from your clutches, you shall smart for this, you may be sure!"</p>
               <p>"Be quiet," said Grey, "for a few moments, and I will be with you."</p>
               <p>"Quiet!" exclaimed Sharkey. "Hell and furies! who could be quiet under such an act of injustice as this?"</p>
               <pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6567-00000101"/>
               <p>"I hope to convince you," said Grey, still going on with his toilet, "that there is no injustice done to you."</p>
               <p>"Where are the papers and other matters I had about me, you infernal old villain? Are you only saving me from death by one hand to murder me by slow degrees yourself, and add robbery to it?"</p>
               <p>"You will consult your own happiness and comfort," Grey replied, "if you will check your violence."</p>
               <p>"May the devil take you! you old scarecrow! Happiness and comfort in this cursed dungeon! Oh, I wish I had the strength of Samson; I would tear down your infernal nest and bury you beneath the ruins!"</p>
               <p>"No doubt; and I have reason to thank Heaven that you are not possessed of the power to carry out your charitable intentions."</p>
               <p>"Grey," said Sharkey, in a milder voice, "what in the devil's name do you mean? What have I done to you, that you should treat me in this manner? And above all, why have you thought it necessary to chain me to this accursed rock, so that I can scarcely find six feet space to walk about in? At least, take this off, and allow me some little exercise."</p>
               <p>"The very first act of your liberty would be to brain me and make your escape."</p>
               <p>"God! you're right there!" cried Sharkey, fiercely; "and I would strangle the life out of your old carcass as it is, if you would ever come within my reach." Here his voice died away in a string of mingled oaths and curses; while Grey having finished his toilet, walked to the door and muttered to himself: "The Doctor will not certainly disappoint me; he promised to be here." For some time he continued to pace up and down the room, and the silence remained unbroken, save by the rattling of the chain which confined Sharkey, and his violent imprecations, as he used his strength to force it from its fastenings. At length hurried footsteps were heard without, and a single rap given upon the door, to which Grey immediately responded by opening it, and Doctor Draper entered.</p>
               <p>He at first started, at Grey's altered appearance, but as he had been previously made acquainted with his plans, he made no remark, but seated himself to hear what further Grey might have to communicate to him.</p>
               <p>"I have asked this visit from you, that you might be near during the coming interview, and aid either of us that most needs your aid," said Grey, the large drops rolling unrestrained down his furrowed cheeks.</p>
               <p>"I shall be happy to serve you, sir, but hope that my services may not be needed."</p>
               <p>"Doctor!" Sharkey called out from the cave, "I hear your voice, and am sorry to believe you implicated in this old devil's plot against me. But you had better finish me up at once; for as God is my judge, if I ever escape, you shall both have a taste of this life I am now leading."</p>
               <p>The Doctor, who was much affected by the agitation of Grey, walked up to the door and said to Sharkey, in a low, mild voice—"Mr. Grey is about to explain everything to you, and you will require all your nerve to sustain you through the interview; you had, therefore, better calm your excitement as much as possible."</p>
               <p>"Why, what a pair of d——d old croakers you are! What the devil have I in common with old Grey? or what do I care for his revelations and explanations? I want my liberty, and if this can not be procured, he may as well save his breath. Such a high-handed outrage as this, Doctor, is without a parallel in modern times; and am I expected to submit quietly to it?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir," the Doctor replied; "you have the privilege to rail, rant, and curse to your satisfaction, if you think this course will do you any good; but I advise you, as a friend, to control your feelings."</p>
               <p>"A devilish pretty friend you are, truly!" Sharkey ejaculated, shaking his chain fiercely, "to witness such an utter violation of law, and counsel calmness. What the devil is in the wind," he said, evidently uneasy, "that you and that old villain croak so mysteriously about?"</p>
               <pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6567-00000102"/>
               <p>Here Grey stepped forward with a light, and interrupting them, said to Doctor Draper: "I fear the effort is hopeless, but I will go in and try. Doctor, did you ever dream of such degradation as he evinces? just snatched, by almost a miracle, from the jaws of death, and now his mouth polluted with oaths and billingsgate, as if there were neither death nor judgment!"</p>
               <p>"He certainly exhibits himself in a very unenviable light, Mr. Grey; and from what I have previously known of him, I should not have dreamed of such a change."</p>
               <p>"You have not known him at all," said Grey; "he has presented himself here only in an assumed character, put on for no good purpose. But if you will retire to a short distance, I will commence the effort to reform him."</p>
               <p>The Doctor retired to the farther end of the room, and Grey sadly and mournfully applied the key to the door, opened it and disappeared, closing it carefully behind him. The cavernous chamber in which Sharkey was confined was exceedingly dark, and the light which Grey carried cast its feeble rays but a short distance into the gloom. As he advanced slowly toward the rude table near where Sharkey was chained, he was surprised that he could not see him; and holding the light over his head, he looked wonderingly forward as he advanced, until he came opposite the table, when Sharkey started suddenly from the ground and made a savage blow at him with a leg of his stool, which he had wrenched out, no doubt with the wicked intention of killing him on the spot. Grey, however, anticipating some such attack, from his previous violence, escaped injury by skillfully avoiding the blow. Sharkey stepped back, as Grey set the light upon the table, and raised the missile as if to hurl it at his head; but while in this attitude his eyes became riveted upon Grey, with a gaze so intent that they seemed ready to start from their sockets. His fingers relaxed from their grasp of the club, and it fell at his feet. With a wild start, he exclaimed, while his appearance was enough to make one's blood freeze: "Great God! what devil's play is this? Who<emph>are</emph> you, that come to me in <emph>this</emph> form? Oh! by all that is dear on earth, sacred in heaven, I pray you," he said, sinking to his knees and covering his face with his hands, "leave my sight! do not blast what little there remains of life in me! Away! away!" he cried, extending one hand in the direction of Grey, but keeping his face concealed with the other; "leave me, in God's name! leave me!" He paused here, and remained crouching like a dog upon the earth, while Grey, without uttering a word, maintained his position, with his eyes riveted upon him. Sharkey at length slowly raised his head and looked toward him, and seeing him still standing mute, and gazing upon him with a stern, reproving look, he started once more wildly to his feet, and pressing his hands upon his temples, cried out: "Leave me, or I shall go mad! Oh! great God! am I in my senses? or is this some vagary of the imagination?—some devil in this guise, sent to freeze my blood? Grey!" he shrieked in a frenzy, extending his arms toward the door, "Grey! in pity come and remove this goblin from my sight!" Turning again to the mute form which still remained motionless near him, he cried out: "Speak! in God's name, speak, before I am bereft of reason! Who are you?"</p>
               <p>"I am," replied Grey, with a slow and measured accent, "your uncle."</p>
               <p>"Living!" shrieked Sharkey.</p>
               <p>"Yes," Grey replied, "living."</p>
               <p>"And Grey?" he asked, the livid foam standing upon his parted lips."</p>
               <p>"Grey and your uncle," the old man answered, "are identical."</p>
               <p>"God! God!" Sharkey ejaculated, "I see it all. Tell me, I pray you," he continued, while his voice sank to a whisper, and he trembled fearfully, "tell me how came you here? how did you escape that—that—hell's furies!" he burst forth; "this is folly—this is mockery! Old man, I am wild! I am frenzied! Madness is now ready to take possession of my brain! Do not torture me with such a cruel game as<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC6567-00000103"/> this!" Then, as if driven to the very extreme of desperation, he rushed forward, and seizing the light from the table, he advanced it toward Grey as far as he could reach, and uttered, in a tone that almost curdled the blood in the old man's veins, "The face—the dress—the size—the whole air—it must be—it is my uncle!" and fell forward senseless upon his face, extinguishing the light and leaving the cave in utter darkness.</p>
               <p>Grey hurried into the outer room and soon returned with another light, accompanied by the Doctor. They raised Sharkey to the bed, and the Doctor immediately commenced applying such remedies as the case demanded. Neither spoke a word, and for half an hour, during which time no material change was observable in Sharkey, they sat by the bedside, watching his haggard and sunken countenance for any sign of returning reason—the uncle indulging in a course of mental questions in regard to the propriety of his conduct, and the Doctor entirely occupied in watching for some change which should indicate that his remedies were producing the wished-for effect. No such evidence, however, was observable; and except that he breathed heavily, Sharkey evinced no sign of life. Dr. Draper at length rose, and taking his wrist in his hand, placed his finger upon his pulse, and for some time silently and intently noted its beatings.</p>
               <p>"How is it with him?" said Grey, hurriedly, as he noticed this movement. "How is it, Doctor?"</p>
               <p>"Grey," replied the Doctor, in a melancholy tone, "I am afraid this interview has been too much for him. The indications are decidedly unfavorable, and I shall have to resort again to blood-letting. This may relieve his head, which is charged with blood. If I fail here, you must be prepared for the worst. Insanity may follow of indefinite duration."</p>
               <p>"Better so—far better so, Doctor," said Grey, wringing his hands in agony; "far better so than to witness his death as a punishment for crime. It is a fearful situation to be placed in; but God knows the purity of my motives, and will sustain me, let the issue be what it may."</p>
               <p>"We will hope for the best, Mr. Grey; in the mean time, prepare me some bandages as soon as possible."</p>
               <p>These were soon ready, and the Doctor, having bandaged one of Sharkey's arms, opened a vein, and the dark current ran slowly down upon the ground, beside the bed; while the Doctor, with the other wrist in his hand, his finger again upon the pulse, with an expression of the most intense anxiety, gazed fixedly into his face to notice the slightest change. A few moments elapsed, and a peculiar twitching of the muscles of the mouth began to be observable, and immediately after one eye opened wide and full, and stared without a ray of intelligence at the Doctor, then slowly closed again. This was followed by a long-drawn sigh, almost amounting to a groan, and the Doctor turned hurriedly to Grey, who sat bent forward upon the bed, and told him to lend his assistance in binding up the arm and stopping the blood, as a change of some kind was about to take place. Before this was finished, Sharkey had commenced a moaning sound, which was continued from time to time in a tone of distress which much increased the anxiety of his uncle, who leaned forward in the hope that these sounds would shape themselves into words. At length this hope was gratified, and Sharkey spoke, but the words were uttered slowly, and there were long intervals between the sentences, as if the utterance was mechanical; and there was no evidence that his expressions were guided by reason.</p>
               <p>He talked incoherently of many things past and present, and his ideas were so confused, and his expressions so broken, that it was next to impossible for a long time to arrange out of the mass of words an intelligible sentence. He soon, however, began to speak more intelligibly, and Grey, from his excited and earnest attention, evidently understood many vague allusions that were not fathomed by Dr. Draper, who was now mostly intent upon physical change, and who exclaimed, in a tone which indicated that he was relieved, at least, from much of his apprehension:</p>
               <p>"Thank God! Mr. Grey, the crisis is past! He may yet<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6567-00000104"/> recover; but I fear much that his mental faculties have received a shock from which they will not soon rally."</p>
               <p>"In short," Grey ejaculated, "he is a maniac!"</p>
               <p>"I am apprehensive that such will be the result for a time, at least, and your utmost care and watchfulness, Mr. Grey, will be required."</p>
               <p>"They shall both be cheerfully given, Doctor, with more hope now than ever, that returning reason will bring repentance and reformation."</p>
               <p>"How dark it is here!" cried Sharkey, breaking in upon their conversation and looking once more wildly about him. "Sharpe, strike a light! Sharpe, I say, strike a light! there is that will, and the Grattan papers; they must be looked to." Then, after a long pause, as if answering some remark which he fancied had been made to him, probably by Sharpe, he said. "Does he say that? Well, I will take means to bring him to his senses. But why don't you strike a light? It's cold here," he added, with a shudder; "and a little fire—ah, yes, a little fire, and we'll burn those other papers, Sharpe."</p>
               <p>Here was a string of remarks hinging at circumstances with which the Doctor and Grey were both partially acquainted; and the latter, with a view of testing the clearness of his mind, stooped over him, and asked—</p>
               <p>"Do you know me, Sharkey?"</p>
               <p>Sharkey turned and looked the old man full in the face, at first with an expression of surprise; and then, turning to the Doctor, looked at one and the other some time before he answered. "Know your certainly, I know you well; you're the devil or something near it. Listen!" he said, drawing Grey's ear close to his lips; you're old Grey, or the devil—or—or—"</p>
               <p>"Or your uncle," said Grey, finishing the sentence for him.</p>
               <p>"Uncle! uncle!" exclaimed Sharkey, as if trying to collect his faculties. "Ah, yes! I <emph>did</emph> have an uncle, who was more father than uncle. But," he continued, with the wild fire of the <unclear>maniac flashing</unclear> from his eye, and pushing Grey back from the bed, "the waters came between us, and," he added, shuddering, "he was no more. I see him now—every day—every hour; that same cry reaches me—that same sight is before me; but he is gone—I am alone! Oh, what would I give if this had never been done!" Most of this was uttered in whispering accents, while he gazed with frightened looks about him, apparently unconscious of the presence of any one; but as he paused again, he turned full upon Grey, and added, as if in reply to what he had said: "No, no! old man, you're old Grey, or the devil, I don't know which. <emph>I know</emph> where my uncle is, and he <emph>can't</emph> be here." And as he again paused for a moment, he turned to the Doctor, and placing his hands upon his head, said to him, in tones perfectly same for the moment: "Doctor, my head feels very strangely; can't you do something for it? I am—am—"</p>
               <p>"What, Duncan?" Grey asked, as he seemed struggling to finish the sentence.</p>
               <p>"Why, I am mad—or dead—or—or dying;" and as he uttered these last, disjointed words, he fell back exhausted upon the bed.</p>
               <p>"Doctor," Grey said, after a pause, "you will now understand more fully the nature of my connection with this wretched man, and may guess at things which I have not told you. Is it not terrible? He was but second in my heart to my own son."</p>
               <p>"It is fearful, Mr. Grey, to contemplate such wickedness; and if your plan for his redemption is successful, it will be not only a miracle, so far as he is concerned, but will entitle you to his everlasting gratitude. I hope that your further efforts in this matter will be crowned with success."</p>
               <p>"But will he recover from this terrible stupor, Doctor? Everything, you know, depends upon that."</p>
               <p>"I think he will, Mr. Grey; but he must be well nursed and closely watched."</p>
               <p>Grey and the Doctor walked into the hut, where the latter gave particular instructions in regard to the treatment of Sharkey; and, promising to call every evening until he was better, took his departure.</p>

               <head type="sub">MRS. GRATTAN'S ANGUISH—HER MIDNIGHT VISIT TO OLD GREY—A BURDEN REMOVED FROM HER MIND.</head>
               <p>THE terrible interest excited by the disclosures contained in her husband's letter sustained Mrs. Grattan until she had reached the last word of the closing sentence, and until she had dismissed Mary in the abrupt manner detailed to Hugo, when she started wildly to her feet, and gazing about her as if fearful there might be some other one near who might become possessed of her fearful secret, she hastily tore the letter into fragments, piled them upon the hearth, and applying the light to them, was not satisfied until the whole mass had been burned to cinders.</p>
               <p>It seemed that a powerful effort had only sustained reason until this should be accomplished; for she then staggered and reeled forward toward the seat she had just left, but fell prostrate and senseless upon the floor before she reached it, in which condition Mary found her when she returned from her interview with Hugo.</p>
               <p>We need not go through the details of the excitement which followed in this little family. Dr. Draper was immediately called from the village and obliged to become the recipient of another secret connected with these sad events, of which he knew more than he dared to reveal. For some weeks he was constant in his attentions, and had the satisfaction, at length, to see Mrs. Grattan restored to reason, and partially to health, but presenting so much of misery and woe in her whole appearance, as scarcely to leave a feature of her former self. A thousand times during her convalescence she had turned and returned in her mind the contents of her husband's letter, every word of which seemed written in fire upon her brain; and after she became able to leave the house (apparently with no other motive than to obey the strict commands of Dr. Draper in regard to air and exercise), she would take long walks, whenever the weather permitted, in the neighboring forest or upon the mountain side, sometimes alone, sometimes accompanied by one or more of her children, but always appearing as if her mind fastened itself to one subject to the neglect of everything else. If accompanied by her children, their prattle and childish enjoyment of everything either grand or beautiful which they saw, could not elicit from her any expression of similar feeling, or interest her in what seemed so full of interest to themselves. Wherever she was—at home, in the woods, surrounded by scenery whose grandeur and sublimity had often thrown her into an ecstasy of delight, sitting upon some moss-covered rock or log, near the place where the encounter had occurred between her husband and Sharkey (whither now her steps were most frequently directed)—her face exhibited ever the same earnest, thoughtful expression—an expression which could not be changed or removed by any ordinary occurrence, and in which an acute observer might read the tenacious fastening of the mind upon one all absorbing idea, the importance of which gave no room for any other. The beautiful scenes around her no more touched her soul, and the smiles or frowns of nature passed alike unheeded. The mind of Mrs. Grattan rests still upon the fatal scenes contained in that fearful letter; and as she cons and digests the facts there presented, and reflects more and more upon the strange conduct of Grey in the interview with her husband, there described, the conviction that the solution of the whole mystery rests with him, and that there is some unrevealed secret in the keeping of the old fisherman connected with the disappearance of the body of Sharkey, is so firmly fastened upon her mind that she can not rid herself of it. To him, then, she has at length determined<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC6567-00000106"/> to go, and satisfy herself that she is or is not mistaken in her suspicions, and either relieve her mind from the load of grief which weighs her down, or learn that that grief is to be a lifetime grief, and that her husband is indeed a murderer. Unlike her husband, however, who, in his alarm and excitement, has submitted himself blindly to the guidance of old Grey, she is not satisfied with external appearances, but, diving beneath these, fancies that she sees some motive which governs the old man's movements, which it is her purpose to unravel, if possible. And with all this there is a hope, grounded upon the same circumstances, that Sharkey may yet be alive. The scene to which we wish now to call the attention of the reader, occurred some weeks after the departure of Hugo, and many months after the voluntary banishment of her husband.</p>
               <p>Twelve o'clock at night—long after the other members of her family have retired to rest—she sat alone in her little parlor in rapt meditation. On the table near her, her shawl and bonnet are lying, as if preparatory to going out. Many times she would leave her seat, and, going to the window, draw aside the curtain and look out, as if to note the character of the night, and strengthen herself for the trial she had imposed, and return to it again with an agitated manner and uncertain steps, as if still undecided.</p>
               <p>The moon was high up in the heavens, shining clear and full, shedding her mild light upon every object, save when obscured by masses of clouds which were driven across the sky, their fleecy edges tinged with snowy white, and again dense enough to obstruct entirely her pale light, leaving the scene without enveloped in gloom. Then, again, long masses of luminous shadow would pass across the scene, giving it a charm which for a while engrossed her attention, and seemed to awaken emotions which had been long overpowered by the one all-absorbing grief connected with her husband's misfortunes.</p>
               <p>Having at length sufficiently strengthened herself for her meditated adventure, she put on her shawl and bonnet, extinguished guished the light, left the house stealthily, passed through the little gate we have mentioned in another portion of our story, stepped out upon the road, where she paused a moment and pressed her hand upon her heart, as if to suppress its rapid beatings; then hurrying along in the shadow of the garden wall, crossed the road at a little distance, and, entering upon the path followed by Hugo but a short time previous, hurried along toward the hut of old Grey; the forest through which she was passing sometimes dark and gloomy when the moon was obscured by the passing clouds; then again brightly illuminated, and bringing rocks and trees into bold relief as she hurried along, and many times startling her with the suddenness with which they started forth from the gloom, and the strange and fantastic forms they assumed. For some time she ran forward, often started by the wild cry of the screech-owl, who, disturbed by such an unusual visitant, flew screaming away before her, and she many times came to a sudden stop, as the echoes of their voices died away in the forest, and looked anxiously behind her, as if tempted to turn and fly back, and give up the object of her adventure, but soon pressing forward again with a courageous determination which would brave every obstacle, whether of reality or the imagination. Exhausted and overcome by her exertions, she at length paused beside the path, and seated herself upon a mass of large stones grouped at the base of a venerable chestnut tree, to recover her breath and think more calmly upon the most proper course to pursue with Grey, if, as she believed, he had it in his power to relieve her mind of the terrible torture with which it had so long been oppressed. Again she revolved in her mind his conversation with her husband; his acknowledgment that he had a strong interest in tracing out certain occurrences with which Sharkey had been connected; his nervous anxiety to have Mr. Grattan go to New York; and, above all, that expression to which he seemed to attach little importance, "that he (Grey) was now, perhaps, the only living soul who knew where the body of Sharkey was concealed," but in which she felt sure <emph>she</emph>detected<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6567-00000107"/> tected a hidden meaning, still occupied her mind, gave hope to her heart and courage to her soul. As she was about to rise to her feet again to resume her walk, a sound reached her ears which for a moment made the blood return to her heart with suffocating force. Voices distinctly heard in conversation, and heavy footsteps following the path in the same direction she had been pursuing, alarmed her so much that she had but strength enough left to conceal herself among the rocks behind the old tree we have mentioned, when she distinctly saw two men approaching, and, with fearful apprehension and suspended breath, watched their movements. They walked slowly forward, both deeply interested in the subject of their conversation, until, within a few feet from the spot where the trembling woman was concealed, one of them stopped, and turning suddenly, confronted the other, and said—</p>
               <p>"I don't believe a word of it, Bill; you may say what you please; I have watched him ever since he came here, and he is no more a regular fisherman than old Blanc or Burton, not a bit."</p>
               <p>"Why," the other returned, "he always 'tends his nets, mends up his traps, and keeps everything in order during the season, just as we do; and I can't, for the life of me, see any such great difference between him and the rest of us. He goes out regular to his nets, night and morning—sells his fish when he catches any, exactly like we do—and for all I can see is regularly trained to the business."</p>
               <p>"This is all make-believe," the other replied. "Did you ever go inside of his shanty?"</p>
               <p>"No! what of that?"</p>
               <p>"Why, nothing, perhaps; but you once go in there, and if you don't change your mind, I'll give up, that's all."</p>
               <p>"What the d——l has he got there, Jim, that makes you think so?"</p>
               <p>"You go there once. He don't talk like our men talk, and he hain't got anything about him like our men. Then there's that stout plank door at the back of his concern, that goes, the d——l only knows where; what's that for? And then, again, his nice guns, game-bags, stuffed birds, books, and forty other 'contraptions.' Tain't like a reg'lar fisherman, no how you can fix it. And what's more of it," he added, lowering his voice, "I believe the old 'cuss' has got lots of money."</p>
               <p>"I don't know nothing about these things, Jim, for I was never inside his concern; but if they are all true, it's somewhat curious, to be sure. I have met the old chap often on the lake, and on the shore by his shanty, when I've been goin' home, and always found him a sociable old codger, at any rate; and if he's got lots of money, as you say, he's just the man to make good use of it."</p>
               <p>"Oh! I don't say nothin' agin' that," the other replied; "but there's something concealed there that people don't know nothin' about; he's a 'singed cat,' now you mind; and if it don't turn out so, I'll treat."</p>
               <p>"What do you mean by something concealed, Jim?"</p>
               <p>"Why, he's got some project afoot that he don't want any one to know nothin' about. What the d——l was old Doc. Draper doin' there, the other night?"</p>
               <p>"Old Doc. Draper! when?"</p>
               <p>"Only two or three nights ago—I was goin' back from town just about this time—and when I got near old Grey's I saw the old Doc. come out and get upon his horse, and I got into the bushes until he went past. They talked some time together at the door, but I was too far off to hear what they said."</p>
               <p>"Well," the other replied, after a short pause, "this is 'durn' curious, to be sure; but the old fellow might have been sick, himself."</p>
               <p>"That may be; but sick people don't gen'rally come to the door after twelve o'clock at night, and stand talking with the Doctor."</p>
               <p>"Well, Jim, we ain't gainin' nothin', standing out here all night," Bill answered; "let's go home—tain't none of our business, <emph>no how.</emph>"</p>
               <pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6567-00000108"/>
               <p>"No," Jim answered, as they moved slowly on again; "tain't none of our business, to be sure; but, Jim, <emph>there's a story in that shanty!</emph> mind what I tell you."</p>
               <p>These were the last words that Mrs. Grattan heard, as the two speakers turned an angle in the path and disappeared. But with what emotions did she emerge again from her concealment! How did her heart leap at the confirmation of her suspicions, which she had gathered from the conversation of these two men; and how eagerly did she press forward through the wood again, regardless of every obstacle, careless of every sound, and only intent upon the object of her visit to Grey! Doubts were now certainties; fears had vanished, or been suddenly converted into hopes; and in such a delirium of excitement as all these feelings engendered, she arrived at old Grey's hut, and threw herself exhausted upon the door-step. A continuous rapping upon his door, accompanied by the cries of a female voice asking for admission, aroused the old fisherman from his slumbers, and, frightened beyond all control by such an unaccountable circumstance, he sprang from his bed, and after stumbling over half the furniture of his hut, succeeded in partially arousing himself; hurried on a portion of his clothes, and, striking a light, ran to the door, and asked, in a voice full of alarm—"Who's there?"</p>
               <p>"For Heaven's sake, Mr. Grey, open the door, quick!" said a gentle voice outside, tremulous with excitement, "before I lose all power to speak!"</p>
               <p>Grey, half-recognizing the voice, and almost paralyzed with astonishment, hastily undid the door, and Mrs. Grattan—her bonnet gone, her garments torn—staggered forward into the hut and sank into a seat, so out of breath that she could not speak.</p>
               <p>"In the name of Heaven, madam!" cried Grey, running up to her and supporting her, "what does all this mean? Tell me, how has this happened?"</p>
               <p>"Grey!" she replied, gasping for breath, "give me time; I am almost dead with excitement. Give me some water! my throat is parched, and my heart almost bursting; pray, give me some water!"</p>
               <p>He hastened to comply with her wishes, and soon presented her with a drink of water from the lake, which seemed to refresh and revive her. "Tell me, now," he said, when she became a little more calm; "tell me how this has happened, and what terrible circumstance could induce you to leave home and come here at this time of night?" As he spoke, he looked uneasily toward the other end of the room; and Mrs. Grattan, following his eyes, started to her feet, and rushing forward in that direction, exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"Where is this strong plank door, they talk about, Grey? I will tear it open with my fingers, but I <emph>will</emph> be satisfied whether my suspicions are well grounded."</p>
               <p>Grey had followed her up, and taking her by the arm led her forward toward the door again, as he repeated her words: "Plank door! suspicions! Mrs. Grattan, you must be beside yourself! Step with me into the open air. What does this conduct mean?" As he concluded, he led her through the door and seated her upon a bench outside, and stood by her, anxiously awaiting her reply.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Grey!" she said, at length, looking up to him pleadingly, "I have run here all the way from my house, to-night, to satisfy my mind upon certain doubts which have kept me for weeks in a state bordering on insanity, it is true; I am not insane to-night, however, but determined to have my mind settled—whether my husband is a murderer or not! This, Mr. Grey, is what has brought <emph>me</emph> here, and you alone can remove this load from my heart, or fasten it there forever!"</p>
               <p>Utterly confounded at these words, Grey exclaimed: "Mrs. Grattan, you overwhelm me with astonishment and alarm. Tell me, in the name of all that is sacred, how has the suspicion that your husband was a murderer, or in any way connected with such a deed, taken possession of your mind?"</p>
               <p>"Grey!" she exclaimed, in excited tones, and not noticing his question, "you <emph>must</emph> answer me, and answer me <emph>truly,</emph>
                  <pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6567-00000109"/> as you value my life—where is Sharkey? Is he really dead?"</p>
               <p>"Hush! madam, for God's sake! do not speak so loud!" he cried, placing his hand upon her arm; "your senses must certainly be wandering—something has happened which has unsettled your mind. Your questions surprise and alarm me, and I can not conceive what you mean?"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Grey," she implored, throwing herself at his feet "upon your answer to these questions depend my happiness—my reason—my life! Look on me, and in pity answer me truly—where is Sharkey? <emph>Is he really</emph> dead?"</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Grattan, your condition, to say nothing of the wildness of your manner and the strange questions you propound to me, have alarmed me terribly; and I must insist upon knowing what has occurred, to induce you to come to me with such inquiries?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Grattan started to her feet, and seizing both his hands, exclaimed again: "Grey! Grey! you must not evade my questions in this manner! This very circumstance gives strength to my suspicions!"</p>
               <p>"If you suspect me of having done any violence to Sharkey, or being in any way connected with it, your suspicions are unfounded, and you are doing me great injustice."</p>
               <p>"No! no!" she answered, wildly; "I do not suspect you of that; but Sharkey is gone—you know whether he is dead or alive—now, if you have a spark of humanity, answer me—where is he? Is he alive?"</p>
               <p>"Tell me, first," he replied, now quite as much excited as herself, "why you ask such questions?"</p>
               <p>"Listen, then!" she said, in a low voice; "if nothing short of this will answer, I <emph>must</emph> tell you"—and she paused again, and looked cautiously about her, as if fearful of being heard.</p>
               <p>"Go on," said Grey, interpreting her looks; "there is no one here who can overhear our conversation."</p>
               <p>"Some weeks ago," she continued, in a tone which went to the old man's heart; "some weeks ago I received a letter from Mr. Grattan, in which he gave me an account of his meeting with Mr. Sharkey in the woods, near this place, and of its <emph>apparently</emph> fatal termination, and also of his interview afterward with you. Some expressions of yours upon that occasion led <emph>me</emph> to suspect that you knew more of the matter than you divulged, and excited the hope that Sharkey, after all, was not dead, and that you had it in your power to remove from my mind every suspicion that my husband <emph>might be</emph> a murderer."</p>
               <p>"Go on," cried Grey, in a tone of intense feeling and excitement.</p>
               <p>"I suspected from your nervous anxiety to have my husband leave home, and your refusal to take him to the place where you told him you had secreted the body, that Sharkey was not dead."</p>
               <p>"In the name of God, what next, madam?"</p>
               <p>"I suspected," Mrs. Grattan went on, with her eyes all the time intently fixed upon his face, "from the acknowledgment, that you had important secrets to unravel connected with Sharkey's former life—and which my husband's refusal to act as you advised would frustrate—that Sharkey was not only <emph>not dead,</emph> but alive, and even now in your custody."</p>
               <p>"My God! my God!" exclaimed Grey; "and you have this night—"</p>
               <p>"Come here to satisfy myself upon this subject. But listen further: As I came here through the wood, I paused, overcome with my exertions, beside the path, and sat down upon a stone at the foot of a tree to recover myself; and while I sat here I heard voices and footsteps approaching over the path I had followed, and secreted myself behind the tree among the rocks until they should pass by. They stopped in the path but a few feet from me, and from them I heard that which confirmed my suspicions, and brought me on here with those suspicions converted almost into certainties."</p>
               <p>"Who were they? What did they say, Mrs. Grattan?" Grey asked, hurriedly.</p>
               <p>"I took them, from their conversation, to be fishermen.<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6567-00000110"/> They talked about you; they said you were not what you seemed—and, among other things, that you had a secret buried here which you did not want the world to know anything about; that there was a mysterious, strong plank door at the back end of your hut that led no one knew whither; that Dr. Draper was seen leaving your house, a few nights since, after twelve o'clock; and that in your habits and manners you were no fisherman."</p>
               <p>"Is it possible, Mrs. Grattan, that you have heard such a conversation as this?" Grey asked, now more excited than ever.</p>
               <p>"Every word of it, Mr. Grey," she answered, never for a moment taking her eyes from his face; and from some indications of fear and wavering which the last part of her story had developed there, taking fresh hope, she repeated, slowly: "every word of it, Mr. Grey; and coupling this conversation with your mysterious manner toward my husband, I came hither to penetrate the secret that is buried here, if possible." As she said this she burst into a flood of tears and sobs which she could no longer control, and exclaimed once more beseechingly, and clinging wildly to the old man's garment: "Now will you longer refuse to answer me? Where is Sharkey?"</p>
               <p>"Here! here!" cried Grey, at last losing all command of himself; "shut out from the world by that very plank door which has excited so much curiosity; and as some compensation for your terrible sufferings, and to relieve you from this depressing anxiety, Mrs. Grattan, you shall know why and how he came here."</p>
               <p>When the old man spoke these words, Mrs. Grattan had clung closer and closer to him, as if fearful of losing a word; and as he ceased to speak, in tones of the wildest excitement and joy she cried out: "Is this true, Mr. Grey? Oh! have my suspicions, then, been well grounded, and is my poor husband, after all, no murderer?"</p>
               <p>"It is all true, my dear madam, and you may throw aside your fears and anxieties forever. It is every word true."</p>
               <p>"I see it all," she cried, with a joyful laugh; "and this explains your anxiety to get me into the open air."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Grey; "I was fearful that Sharkey might overhear our conversation, and was unwilling that my secret should be discovered, unless absolutely necessary."</p>
               <p>"But why any secret?" asked Mrs. Grattan; "why have you not made it known that he was yet living, when all the world are in doubt as to his fate?"</p>
               <p>"You must now necessarily be made acquainted with some of my motives, Mrs. Grattan, but only under a promise of strict secrecy."</p>
               <p>"This is requiring too much, Mr. Grey, of a wife whose husband is an exile, with the brand of a murderer upon his brow. He, at least, must know that Sharkey lives."</p>
               <p>"Your husband will not be long in suspense, Mrs. Grattan, and you can intimate to him in your next letter that you <emph>have hopes</emph> that Sharkey is not dead, and ground these hopes, without saying anything about the facts, upon the mysterious remarks of mine to your husband, which you tell me was the cause of your undertaking this unparalleled adventure to-night. Give me the promise of secrecy, Mrs. Grattan, and I will tell you everything that is mysterious in this matter, and you may rest assured that a part of my motive is as much to secure your happiness—the happiness of your husband and family—as to hasten other events which I will reveal to you in good time."</p>
               <p>"I give you the promise," replied Mrs. Grattan, "believing implicitly what you say, and shall be willing to be guided by you if you convince me that this is all true."</p>
               <p>Satisfied with this promise, Grey then revealed to Mrs. Grattan such of his motives as he thought proper to intrust to her; telling her that so far as her husband was connected with the circumstances disclosed to her, she should know all so soon as he could be satisfied himself that certain hopes he was indulging were well founded." And in tones of the greatest affection and sympathy, he added: "Mrs. Grattan, I hope this will satisfy you for the present, and as a motive to you to<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6567-00000111"/> be exceedingly guarded, I will tell you further, that if my anticipations are realized, what I have in view is of the utmost importance to you and yours."</p>
               <p>"Mysterious as this all seems to me, Grey, and painful as it will be to me, I will not interfere with your plans by following the dictates of my own heart, as you assure me so solemnly that my poor husband may have important interests at stake in the investigations you are making. But, Mr. Grey, I feel that you will not keep a husband and father in this cruel belief a moment longer than is necessary."</p>
               <p>"Not one moment, my dear madam," said Grey, warmly; "and whatever may be the result of these efforts, neither himself nor his family shall be losers thereby. Now, Mrs. Grattan, if you will permit me, I will see you safe back to your home, and when my inquiries are brought to a close, you shall know the result. Are you satisfied with this arrangement?"</p>
               <p>"Tell me, before I leave this subject, Mr. Grey, who <emph>you</emph> are!" she suddenly asked, looking at the old man with a fixed stare of wonder. "Who are <emph>you,</emph> that promise so much with such apparent confidence?"</p>
               <p>"No matter for the present, Mrs. Grattan, who <emph>I</emph> am; I give you my word of honor that what I have spoken is true, and that I am abundantly able to keep my promises. Are you satisfied? Will you trust me?"</p>
               <p>"Fully! fully!" she answered; "and I will throw no obstacles in your way to thwart you in your purpose, as it proposes so much of good in the end to me and mine. God knows we need it."</p>
               <p>This conversation was continued further in low voices, as Grey walked back through the wood with Mrs. Grattan, and he left her at the gate in front of her own little cottage, happy in the result of her expedition, and more filled with wonder and astonishment than her poor husband had been at the mysterious atmosphere which surrounded old Grey.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE CITY AND COUNTRY—ARTISTS AND THEIR STUDIOS IN NEW YORK—THE SUCCESSFUL DAUB AND NEGLECTED GENIUS—HOW TO GET A FRAME FOR THE PICTURE.</head>
               <p>WE will now change the scene of our story, and introduce the reader to a new location and new characters; and leaving the country village and the noble mountains which surround it, and the little lake on whose shore it quietly rests, we shall ask you to follow, with us, through other and no less trying circumstances, the fortunes of Hugo Blanc and Mr. Grattan, in the great city of New York.</p>
               <p>Though city life presents so much to the eye that is attractive—so much upon the surface that is bright and beautiful—still beneath these superficial appearances it contains more of sorrow, wretchedness, vice, and crime than is to be found anywhere else. We find here the prevailing sentiment of a people fully developed; all classes of feelings and ideas being represented, and the prevailing sentiment is a pretty good index to the prevailing sentiment of the nation or people at large.</p>
               <p>We find here, perhaps, more who possess a given taste; more who are victims to a given vice; and more crime and wretchedness are disclosed to our view; but in the aggregate, the people are much as we find them elsewhere, and it can not with truth be asserted that any of our cities contain any more of correct taste, cultivated intellect, or appreciation of what is refined and beautiful, than could be found among the same number scattered over wider districts. Only in the<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6567-00000112"/> items of vice, poverty, and crime does the city transcend the country; and the simple reason is, that the inducements to crime are two-fold greater in the city, to say nothing of the wrongs and wretchedness which force a large portion of the population into vice. The whole growth of a city is a sort of hot-house production, which is self-exhaustive, and hence supplies from the country are necessary. Your business men, your men of intellect, your most fresh and able literary men, and your artists are constantly supplied from the country, and it is rare to find an instance of greatness in any branch which has been of exclusive city growth and education, and which had not the foundation of its development in the country. It is needless to dwell upon facts that are thus open to all; it is our province, at present, to deal with characters in their various experiences of this same city life, and let their experiences point the moral.</p>
               <p>There are certain places in all cities around which artists love to congregate; and you scarcely ever find one in one part of a building, without finding one or more of his companions in misery in other parts of it. As you enter the hall on the first floor in search of some one of these, you see their various cards displayed upon the door-post or wall—one of which informs you that "Beech," the landscape painter, occupies the fourth floor; "Broddie, still-life painter," third floor; and "Soaplocks," the successful painter of fools and snobs, on the second floor. The latter occupies "furnished apartments," while his companions work and live in mere "dens." Enter any one of them, and my life for it, you will find it furnished much in the following manner:</p>
               <p>On first opening the door your olfactories are saluted by an almost unbearable stench of tobacco smoke, and as you look forward through the blue vapor, you see at the farther end of the room, beneath a half-screened window, an casel, upon which stands a canvas; beneath which canvas you see a pair of legs, and above which rolls a cloud of smoke, which curls gracefully up to the ceiling, and thence through the whole room. You rap upon the door, or cough, to indicate your presence, and from behind the above-mentioned canvas a head with a cadaverous countenance is turned toward you, with sunken, solemn eyes looking curiously at you from out the wilderness of uncombed hair which surrounds them; a mouth, covered with a piratical-looking moustache, from whose tangled masses protrudes the stem of an enormous pipe, whose capacious bowl, filled with horrible tobacco, rests upon his breast. The <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tout ensemble</foreign> makes up a character you would be "immensely" afraid of, should you meet him in some by-place. You walk hesitatingly forward, and after mutual salutations (your eyes having become accustomed to the place)—you look again about you, and things unseen before are gradually revealed to you. In one corner, a pile of "stretchers," some with and some without canvases; in another (if the weather is cold), piled upon the floor, a scanty supply of coal; above which hang some two or three dirty pallets. Opposite the coal-pile, in another corner, is screened off with black muslin the artist's sleeping apartment (if he is able to afford the bed and the black muslin screen), behind which, if you were allowed to look, you would get new ideas of what humanity <emph>can</emph> endure. After diligent search through the compound filth of dirt, tobacco, cigar-ends, powdered coal, etc., you <emph>may</emph> detect the faded colors of what <emph>was once</emph> a carpet, and you <emph>may not;</emph> this depends upon how recently the studio has been swept. In all sorts of disorder everywhere around the room, in proper and improper places, are scattered books, drawings, paintings (finished and unfinished)—boots (if he has any), slippers, boot-jack, a pan of water full of brushes (the accumulation of past months, which he has been too lazy to wash), and the stub of an old broom; a stand, covered with an indiscriminate collection of brushes, colors, oil-cups, half-burnt cigars, and cigar ashes, a small bottle of turpentine, another of oil, another of varnish, from the drippings of which a thick, nasty paste, compounded of all these things, is fast concealing the original materials of which the table was made. You turn up your nose <emph>slightly,</emph> in disgust at the appearance of things about you; the artist<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6567-00000113"/> reads your impressions in your face, and blushingly invites you to look at his picture. You take the place he silently points out to you, and to your utter astonishment behold a master-piece; and as you look and admire, you wonder more and more at the strange and contradictory elements which make up the character of the artist.</p>
               <p>Within a few squares of the American Art-Union building, at the time we allude to, many artists had their studios (some worse, some far better than the one here described), a few of them in that building itself, and others at greater or less distances from it—there being an evident inclination among them, however, to be near this great center, from which, it was hoped, was destined to be disseminated through the length and breadth of the land such influences as would cause our people to be classed as a refined people; and thus hopes were entertained of that permanent and reliable aid which would place them in the position to which they are justly entitled. It was but natural that those who secured rooms in this building should have been considered fortunate by their less lucky brethren.</p>
               <p>Mr. Grattan, when he arrived in the city, found all these eligible situations occupied, and was satisfied with a very poor room, at the top of a four-story building, some distance above the Art Union, on Broadway, in which were also domiciled several other artists of various degrees of merit; and who, from first gazing at him with curious, questioning looks, had at length become more sociable, and at the time we take up the thread of our story again, the artistenants of the building were upon intimate terms, and frequently interchanged, in one or another of their rooms, thoughts and ideas, not only upon Art, but upon whatever subject might accidentally be broached among them. Mr. Grattan had already taken no mean rank among his brethren of the brush, and had made familiar acquaintance with the active officers of the Art Union, with picture-dealers, with dealers in artists' materials, and all that class of people with whom artists are generally thrown in contact. He had as yet, however, exhibited nothing but one or two pieces, nearly completed, which had called forth unqualified praise from those of his professional brethren who had seen them, and he toiled on, in the hope that these were only to be finished to find purchasers.</p>
               <p>He had for the first time in years begun to hope, and although the feeling was not by any means strong, and was frequently followed by, or was only the precursor of, fits of melancholy, still there was an air of respectful deference among the artists, and an apparent honesty in their criticisms of his work, as it progressed, that naturally led him to anticipate a change in his affairs for the better. His scanty supply of funds was running low, and he looked forward with dread to the day when he should find himself without means and without patronage, if, unfortunately, such was to be the case. And when I say that he began to hope, I merely mean that an occasional ray broke through the habitual gloom which had fastened itself upon his mind.</p>
               <p>His room was on the last floor of the building, lighted by two attic or dormer windows, one of which looked into the street, and the other into an open court, surrounded on four sides by "Rooms to Let," which rose tier upon tier, each having its occupant or occupants; and from his high back-window Mr. Grattan could see nearly all the windows on three sides of this "human hive," and often sat here, looking at the different faces that presented themselves to his view—some joyful, some sad, some grief-stricken, some desperate, and wonder what tales of neglect, wrong, and injustice these inmates of this gloomy pile might unfold.</p>
               <p>His co-laborers in the field of Art were all in the front of the building, except a young man of Irish descent, by the name of Byrnie, a promising landscape-painter, who roomed upon the same floor as he did himself, their doors opening upon opposite sides of a little dark landing, which had no light except that which was thrown upon it when one or other of these doors was opened. Byrnie had many of the traits peculiar to the country of his parents, but had, from education<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6567-00000114"/> tion and association, become quite "Americanized" in manners and general deportment. He was generally in high spirits, seldom depressed, but when so, was bitter, impulsive, and cutting toward all who opposed or crossed him, to the last degree; and he was particularly rich in his invectives upon the folly, wrongs, vice, and corruption which surrounded him. In this particular he was almost a match for Grattan himself. But Byrnie's fits of rage and indignation were followed by moments of sunshine and joy—Grattan's, never; his hopes had never yet got in the ascendant sufficiently to make him jocose and playful, though generally affable and gentlemanly to all.</p>
               <p>Tucker and Brown, other artists, were tenants of the same building, one on the floor below, and the other on the second floor. Brown was a respectable portrait-painter, and the other a daub. In this instance, as in many others I have known, the best patronized was the least meritorious of the four, and most comfortably quartered. Adolphus Rembrandt Tucker could take his meals <emph>regularly</emph> at the restaurant "over the way," enjoyed the luxury of a clean shirt twice a week, sported his rattan-cane, whiskers, and moustache, talked largely of Rembrandt and the whole catalogue of ancient and modern masters, of whom he really knew nothing, and painted most ineffably mean pictures. Tucker had his carpeted room, his plaster busts, and models from the "antique," his neatly furnished bedroom adjoining his studio, and altogether swaggered before his silk, satin, and velvet patrons as <emph>the</emph> artist.</p>
               <p>Brown, on the next floor above, was a modest, enthusiastic, diligent devotee to his art, giving promise of genius which would one day make a reputation where reputation is worth struggling for. He ate his two meals a day <emph>in his room,</emph> slept upon a scantily covered cot in one corner, painted heads for five and ten dollars apiece (when he could get heads to paint), while Adolphus Rembrandt Tucker complacently pocketed his sixty and seventy dollars apiece for pictures entirely valueless.</p>
               <p>Adolphus had considerable dramatic talent, acquired behind the scenes and in the green-rooms of the various theaters, and could do Hamlet's soliloquy, "To be, or not to be," etc., Othello's "Most potent, grave, and reverend seignors," Richard's "Now is the winter of our discontent," etc., in a manner that thrilled to their very kid slippers his simpering patrons, who were one and all of the opinion that Adolphus Rembrandt Tucker was "a love of a man," and possessed of histrionic as well as artistic talent enough to rival Forrest or Elliott.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Mrs. Trotter!" said Mrs. Quantum, as she descended to her carriage and met the former lady just arrived, to sit, "oh, Mrs. Trotter! I declare that talented young man has so shocked my nerves by his terrible delineations of character, that I really could scarcely get down to the street. Ain't he wonderful, Mrs. Trotter?"</p>
               <p>"Ah! wonderful, you may well say, Mrs. Quantum. Husband is of the opinion that he is without a rival, either as an artist or actor, and thinks that he might be equally successful in either profession." So the ladies parted—one to her carriage, and the other to the studio of Tucker, who met her at the door with a tremendous stride (brow knit and head bent on his breast), with "To <emph>be,</emph> or <emph>not</emph> to be, Mrs. Tucker? that is <emph>the</emph> question!"</p>
               <p>"La, me! Mr. Tucker," the lady screamed; "you frighten me!"</p>
               <p>"Frightened, lady!" said Tucker, changing his tone to the "deep sepulchral," and rolling up his eyes; "I have seen pale ghosts, at midnight, peopling earth and air, and not a nerve unstrung."</p>
               <p>At this point the lady runs forward, and taking the embryo tragedian by the arm, in pleading tones exclaims: "O dear, Mr. Tucker, don't! it's really dreadful!" And Tucker, with a smile of self-conscious superiority, leads the lady to her seat, and the sitting begins.</p>
               <p>Higher up, Byrnie and Grattan, in both the same field, gifted with extraordinary talent, worked out <emph>their</emph> salvation<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6567-00000115"/> upon one meal a day, and without any patrons, waiting patiently for the opening of the American Art Union, where each expected to sell works now approaching completion, and through the aid of which both hoped to gain fame enough, at least, to keep them employed. These two slept upon the floor, rolled up in their cloaks—dreamed of triumphs never to be realized, and woke to toil on from day to day, unnoticed and unsought.</p>
               <p>Time passed on, and the papers had announced that the productions of artists would be received at the Art-Union rooms, and that the galleries would be thrown open to the public in a few days. The whole world of Art was in an excited state, and the public mind was on tiptoe with expectation.</p>
               <p>We will look in upon Byrnie and Grattan, who had met one morning about this time, in the room of the former, and were examining his picture, now completed, and only wanting its frame to be sent to the gallery.</p>
               <p>"I can speak of this picture of yours, Byrnie," Grattan remarked, "without hesitation, and I assure you I think it excellent. It must be purchased, if the committee are guided by either judgment or good taste. I wish I was as clear in my conviction in regard to my own picture; but it is not so. I can see the beauties of yours; but whenever I sit down before my own, trying to make up an unbiased judgment in regard to them, I am invariably disgusted, and find it difficult to control an impulse to destroy them."</p>
               <p>"Don't do anything of the sort, Grattan. I know all about that sort of feeling, for I used to feel just so myself. Your picture is a fine one, highly creditable to you. It is probably an improvement on any of your former works, and you ought to fail if you permit your modesty to stand in the way of your advancement. When framed, if hung in a decent light, I have no doubt it will attract much attention, and bring you a handsome price."</p>
               <p>"Framed!" Grattan exclaimed, despondingly. "I was just going down to Mason &amp; Carter's to see if I could make any arrangements to get a frame. I have not money enough to pay for one now, and unless I can get credit, I shall not be able to get my picture into the Art Union when it is finished."</p>
               <p>"Well, for Heaven's sake, Grattan, don't go to Mason &amp; Carter's," cried Byrnie, laughing; "I got my frame of them on tick, and it is to be sent home in the morning. I don't believe that they would trust another poor devil like myself. You had better, by all means, call on Graves &amp; Denny; they are said to be first-rate men, and I have no doubt they will accommodate you if you frankly tell them your circumstances. This you can do without doing any violence to your feelings or wounding that nice sense of honor of yours, which, permit me to say, is terribly in your way, and is an entirely useless sentiment here in New York. It might do in the country, where people are still green enough to believe in honesty; but here it is worse than folly, and will only be a continual stumbling-block to you."</p>
               <p>"This is humiliating enough," Grattan replied, without noticing Byrnie's concluding remarks; "but I suppose there is no alternative. I am glad, however, that you have told me this, as a refusal would have mortified me exceedingly. I will try Graves &amp; Denny. If I fail in getting a frame on these terms, I will give one picture for a frame to the other, when finished."</p>
               <p>"But that will take you some time yet to finish," Byrnie replied; "and if I am to judge you by myself, there is no time so lose. We <emph>must</emph> have money soon, or suspend," he continued, drawing his finger around his neck, with a peculiar jerk of the head upward. "That would look Wall-streetish, Grattan," he added, with a laugh. "They suspend there, when, like us, they have nothing, or when, <emph>unlike</emph> us, they have <emph>enough to retire upon.</emph> Thus they cheat their customers out of their money, as you and I should cheat the world of two of its most brilliant ornaments were we to act upon my suggestion."</p>
               <p>To Byrnie's surprise, Grattan turned deadly pale at this<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6567-00000116"/> humor of his; and, starting to his feet, he exclaimed: "Byrnie, if all Wall Street were suspended in the manner you alluded to, I do not suppose that Art, or those who practice it, would feel the loss, and nine tenths of the whole population will give themselves little trouble whether you or I hang or starve."</p>
               <p>"Well, for my part, Grattan, I'm not going to gratify the public by putting myself in either of those positions. I will <emph>steal</emph> before I will starve or hang."</p>
               <p>"Better beg than steal, Byrnie."</p>
               <p>"No, curse me! not I, Grattan! I would rather rot in the Tombs than beg. Oh! Grattan," he added, vehemently, "how little this infernal dollar-and-cent world knows about such men as you and I! If we could stoop to put on a little gas and humbug, like this cursed squirt below—this Adolphus Rembrandt Tucker!—the thing might possibly go off. Did you ever, in your life, see such flummery as he gets into his pictures! Such hotch-potch mixtures of blue, red, and yellow; such lavish profusion of lace and jewelry! Yet, look at his patrons! They arrive in carriages, which parade before the door—while the brainless owners are having all of them that is worth preserving (their jewelry and tinsel) immortalized by the immortal pencil of the thrice immortal Adolphus Rembrandt Tucker! Poor Brown, in the mean time, although doing much better than you or I, barely gets enough to keep soul and body together, and <emph>he</emph> is an artist whose name will be known to fame when this thing of whiskers and hair has sunk into well-merited oblivion."</p>
               <p>"Well, Byrnie," Grattan replied, "for Heaven's sake, don't let us get upon this subject again. I can not speak for you, but in me it raises a tempest which is hard to quell. Will you go with me to Graves &amp; Denny's and see what my fate is to be in regard to the frame?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly! certainly!" Byrnie exclaimed, "and if we are unsuccessful there, we will <emph>patronize</emph> some one with keener perceptions and better able to read character."</p>
               <p>This matter settled, the two went forth into the street, and hastened forward toward their destination, Byrnie singing snatches of old, familiar songs, and Grattan, grave and taciturn, nursing his own unpleasant thoughts, and wondering how his friend could be so merry.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE CONNOISSEURS OF ART—AN UNFORTUNATE DISCLOSURE—HUGO'S PICTURE.</head>
               <p>AS the two were passing Mason &amp; Carter's, one of the largest artists' furnishing establishments in the city, Byrnie caught Grattan by the arm and stopped him suddenly, just in front of the door, calling his attention to a group of well-dressed gentlemen inside, who were apparently examining some work of Art lately received.</p>
               <p>"Let us step in, Grattan! here are some specimens of what I call dollar-made connoisseurs, and we shall have an opportunity to hear something rich. See! there is old Grabb, the Wall Street banker. In God's name! how does he stand up under such a weight of gold chains and jewelry? He is an oracle in matters of Art, and knows about as much of the merits of a picture as a horse. Well, now, here is a rare collection," he continued, examining the crowd more closely; "do you see that wild, cadaverous-looking, anatomical specimen almost facing us, there? Well, that is the Hon. Peter Cognovit, formerly a judge, more recently a member of Congress, and within a short time returned from a 'tour of the Continent'—Lord! when so many asses get together there must be some very learned braying! Let us go in, Grattan, if you want some fun!"</p>
               <p>"I don't care to go in, Byrnie, for we shall hear nothing but what will disgust us, I am satisfied, from your account of the parties."</p>
               <p>"Oh!" Byrnie replied, laughing, "that is just what want; I want to show you what 'sort of cattle' we call connoisseurs, in New York."</p>
               <p>"I hope," said Grattan, "these are not fair specimens of the class; you certainly have a different order of critics from those, in the city?"</p>
               <p>"In this vast metropolis," replied Byrnie, describing a circle with his right hand, "perhaps a dozen—not any more. The rest become connoisseurs and men of taste, from cabmen and soap-boilers. They chaffer and jew for the labors of the artist as they do for a looking-glass or set of chairs, and place about as much value upon one as the other. If there is any difference it is in favor of the looking-glass. Better and better!" he exclaimed, after a sudden pause, and looking again at the group of gentlemen inside—"there is that tallow-faced, sleek-looking Cavil. By the way, we must go some day and hear him preach. He has the richest and most unexceptionably <emph>dressed</emph> congregation in the city, and he preaches just to <emph>suit them;</emph> of course, he is popular, and gets a good salary. He's a 'sweet preacher,' and will call on you, Grattan, as soon as he learns that you are in favor with a few wealthy snobs." All this while Byrnie was moving his head from right to left, trying to make out the different parties who had thus attracted his attention, and wound up his disjointed remarks with a loud laugh, and exclaimed: "By Jove! there's old Gamble, the Gilded Hippopotamus! Lord! we <emph>must</emph> go in, Grattan! Such a treat won't come often, even in New York."</p>
               <p>So saying, the two artists entered the establishment, and circling the well-dressed group alluded to, without apparently noticing them, took a position on the opposite side of the room, near enough to hear what passed, but apparently examining the pictures which everywhere greeted the eyes in this immense establishment.</p>
               <p>The party of gentlemen who had called forth these sarcasms from Byrnie were closely grouped around a small picture which Mr. Mason was exhibiting to them; and after they had had sufficient time to judge of its merits, he asked, with a<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6567-00000118"/> curious twinkle in his eyes, "Well, gentlemen, who do you think is the artist?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly," said the consequential Grabb, with a hesitating look at the Hon. Peter Cognovit, "it's no <emph>American</emph> production; it is from the hand of some European artist. We have no Americans who can paint such animals."</p>
               <p>"You have just taken the word out of my mouth," the greasy Chamble chimed in, who had all this time been noticing the glances directed to the Hon. Peter Cognovit, and had witnessed the learned bows by which that "enlightened connoisseur" replied to these glances—"you have just taken the word out of my mouth, Mr. Grabb; we have no such freedom among <emph>our</emph> artists as is exhibited here—no such masterly breadth of effect and such pleasing tone. I should pronounce that a—a—;" and the greasy gentleman continued to dwell upon the a—a, looking alternately at the Hon. Peter Cognovit and the picture, hoping that that gentleman would come to his relief and pronounce the name of the artist. Disappointed in this expectation—for the Hon. Peter Cognovit was too shrewd a man to allow anyone to sport his laurels—he repeated again, in a lower voice, "I should pronounce that, gentlemen, a fine production—indeed, a master-piece."</p>
               <p>"So should I!" "so should I!" resounded from several members of the group, and they clustered with supercilious smiles around the Hon, gentleman, as Mr. Mason still, with that funny twinkle in his eyes, asked,</p>
               <p>"What is <emph>your</emph> opinion of the picture, Mr. Cognovit?"</p>
               <p>The Hon. Peter, thus appealed to, cleared his throat, inflated his dried-up lungs, spit formally twice, and placing his gold-headed cane to his under lip, prepared to deliver an opinion which was to settle the question; and while this preparation was going forward, Byrnie said to Grattan, in a low voice—</p>
               <p>"Now, ain't this rich? Breadth of effect, freedom, and all that—ha! ha! Do let us draw a little nearer to hear this profound opinion, as well as to see this wonderful gem, which has excited encomiums enough to make the fortune of the artist, whoever he may be."</p>
               <p>"If he should prove to be a European," said Grattan, bitterly, who now stood with his eyes intently fixed upon the picture, as if fascinated, never moving them from it during the delivery of the Hon. Peter Cognovit's opinion, which was in the following words:</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, I do not speak of it in a boasting way at all, but I have traveled in Europe, and flatter myself that I am capable of judging of the relative merits of both the ancient and modern masters. I am well acquainted with the works of the French and German animal painters, and I have dwelt with peculiar delight upon the admirable pictures of Edwin Landseer. If my judgment is worth anything, gentlemen, this is either an original Landseer, or such a perfect copy of one of his works as should entitle the artist to a liberal patronage and substantial fame."</p>
               <p>"If I thought it a Landseer," said Grabb, pushing his chubby hands deep into his breeches' pockets "I would become the owner at <emph>any</emph> price."</p>
               <p>"<emph>My</emph> opinion is, Mr. Grabb," said the Hon. Peter Cognovit, evidently not relishing the implied doubt—"<emph>my</emph> opinion is, <emph>sir,</emph> that it <emph>is</emph> an original. There are no artists in <emph>Europe,</emph>
                  <emph>much less</emph> in America, who could imitate <emph>his</emph> style so well as to deceive <emph>me,</emph> I assure you."</p>
               <p>During the whole of this colloquy, Byrnie had been at intervals giving Grattan punches in the ribs with his elbow, interspersed with exclamations such as, "Ain't it rich? the tallow-faced ignoramus! now listen to his Hawnor! There, Grattan, ain't that both profound and conclusive?—ha! ha! ha! Now we will see whether Grabb will purchase the 'genuine Landseer' at <emph>any</emph> price."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Mason, excuse me," cried Grattan, rushing forward, heedless of Byrnie's remarks, and for some cause glancing at the picture like a madman—"tell me where you got that picture?" and suddenly recovering himself, as all eyes were directed toward him, he stammered out, "I thought I <emph>knew</emph> the picture. Do <emph>you</emph> know," he continued, in a less excited voice, "where it came from?"</p>
               <pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6567-00000119"/>
               <p>Mr. Grabb drew his hands from his pockets, and at the same time gave birth to a monster sigh, which came forth from his capacious abdominal regions (Mr. Grabb had no heart or brains where sighs could be generated, and having to trace the effect to a cause, where else could we locate it, except among his nether viscera?), and the Hon. Peter Cognovit and his connoisseur friends stood looking upon the strange, wild, cadaverous, hungry-looking individual who had so unceremoniously broken through the little group, as if they could annihilate him.</p>
               <p>"Do you know," Mr. Grattan asked again, still keeping his eyes upon the little picture—"do you know, Mr. Mason, where this picture came from?"</p>
               <p>"I suppose," said the Hon. Peter Cognovit, "it doesn't matter much where it came from—its identity is indisputable. Ha! ha! ha!" he continued, "it is simply absurd to attribute <emph>that</emph> composition to any one but Landseer."</p>
               <p>"Excuse me, sir," Grattan replied, turning to his Honor, and looking at him in a manner which made that gentleman avoid his gaze—"excuse me if <emph>I</emph> venture, in this instance, to doubt your authority. Unless I am much mistaken, I know both the picture and its author."</p>
               <p>"Oh!" the Hon. gentleman cried, jumping at any point to save his reputation as an oracle in Art, "it is a <emph>copy</emph> of Landseer, then?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir," said Grattan; "it is, if I am right, an original sketch, merely from the hand of a boy now about twenty years of age, who has never seen one of Landseer's paintings in his life."</p>
               <p>"I simply guess," his Hon. answered, indignantly, "that you are mistaken. That picture is at least a <emph>copy</emph> of Landseer, whatever <emph>you</emph> may say to the contrary."</p>
               <p>Grattan's eye flashed at this rude reply, and he was about to retort angrily, when, as the distinguished connoisseur turned to walk away, followed by his friends, Byrnie caught Grattan by the arm, and said: "Hold on, Grattan, for God's sake! the Hon. Peter Cognvit has unbounded influence in the world of Art, in New York, and you might as well cut your throat at once as to make an enemy of him!"</p>
               <p>"I can't help it!" Grattan replied, "<emph>I must</emph> know how this picture came here; and if my young friend is in the city I must find him out, let the consequences be what they may. Mr. Mason," he asked once more, "how came that picture here? can you tell me?"</p>
               <p>"No, I can not," he replied; "but I think I can furnish a clew, sir, that will enable you to find out all about it. The picture was brought here some days ago, by a hack driver, who lives somewhere near the Hoboken Ferry. He told me that it was given to him to bring here to be sold, by a young man who was run over by a carriage some days since, and who, he said, was then lying at his house."</p>
               <p>"Did he give you any clew as to the young man's former place of residence?"</p>
               <p>"No; he simply said that he came down the river on the evening boat, and was going across the landing to take a carriage, when a pair of horses, becoming alarmed at the steam bursting from the escape-pipe of the steamer, broke from the driver, and, dashing forward through the crowd, ran over him before he could get out of the way."</p>
               <p>"It is he, as sure as you live," Grattan remarked to Byrnie, "and we must find him if possible."</p>
               <p>"The man did not tell me what street he lived on, or anything about it; so that it will be utterly impossible for you to find him without his address. You had better leave me your number, Mr. Grattan, and when the man comes to inquire about the picture, I will send him to you."</p>
               <p>"That will be much the best way, Grattan," said Byrnie; "it will be useless to try to find him without having some clew to his whereabouts."</p>
               <p>"I wonder," Grattan asked, vacantly, "if the poor boy has any attention?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes!" Mason replied, "this new-found friend told me that he had called in a good physician, who was doing everything that he could."</p>
               <pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6567-00000120"/>
               <p>"Was the boy much hurt, Mr. Mason?" Grattan asked again, his countenance full of interest in what he heard.</p>
               <p>"Well, I inferred from what the man said, that there were no broken bones, but that he was badly bruised, both externally and internally."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Mason, let me take that picture!" cried Grattan, suddenly looking up the room and seeing the Hon. Peter Cognovit and his party leisurely sauntering toward the door again; "I will make an effort, at any rate, to do the boy a kindness."</p>
               <p>"Certainly, Mr. Grattan—I understand your motive; but you can not sell it <emph>there,</emph> now," he said, with a look toward the approaching gentlemen. "If you could have restrained your curiosity, I could easily have had a hundred dollars for it from Grabb, but you could not sell it to him now, at any price."</p>
               <p>"I would not try," Byrnie interposed, taking hold of Grattan's arm; "the brainless old ass will only insult you."</p>
               <p>"I <emph>will</emph> make the effort, at all hazard, for Hugo's sake!"</p>
               <p>"For Hugo's sake!" Byrnie repeated; "it is a beautiful name, at any rate, and you are a glorious, good fellow, Grattan; but it won't be of any use."</p>
               <p>The approaching party had now nearly reached the point where Mr. Grattan and his companions were standing, when he took up the picture, and approaching Mr. Grabb, touched him gently, and leading him from the group, said—</p>
               <p>"I hope, Mr. Grabb, you will excuse the liberty I take in addressing you without the formality of an introduction; but the interest I feel in the young friend who painted this picture, and who is now suffering from an injury received the day of his arrival here, has made me bold to ask you to become its purchaser."</p>
               <p>"I believe," Grabb replied, "I don't want the picture, <emph>sir.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"I thought," Mr. Grattan observed, "that I heard you say, a few moments since, that you would be glad to have it, <emph>at any price.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"If it was a <emph>Landseer,</emph> I said."</p>
               <p>"Is it not worth something, Mr. Grabb?"</p>
               <p>"Not to me; you see, Mr.—, Mr.—, what's your name?"</p>
               <p>"Grattan, sir."</p>
               <p>"An artist yourself, I believe?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>"Well, Mr. Grattan, you will understand that the picture of a young man without reputation—a novice—can neither add to the value or attractions of my collection."</p>
               <p>"I thought," Mr. Grattan replied, "that a <emph>good</emph> picture was valuable from <emph>any</emph> hand, and particularly should it be so from a hand which, it seems, can so successfully counterfeit Landseer."</p>
               <p>"I do not expect <emph>an artist,</emph> Mr. Grattan, to take a <emph>practical</emph> view of a question like this; and although I can but applaud your interest in your young friend (I hope he may entirely recover from his injuries), I don't wish to buy the picture." And bowing profoundly, Mr. Grabb joined his companions, and the whole party sauntered up Broadway, in the direction of the Art Union.</p>
               <p>"What did I tell you, Grattan?" Byrnie cried out, as the latter joined him and Mason again, with a crest-fallen air, "what did I tell you? There is not one of the whole party that would give three cents for the picture now. You had done far better for your young friend if you had smothered your curiosity for a while."</p>
               <p>"I acknowledge the truth of what you say, Byrnie; but I acted upon the belief that there was some little <emph>genuine</emph> taste among them, and believed that as they had admired the picture so much, some one of them would be willing to become the owner at <emph>some</emph> price."</p>
               <p>"Genuine taste!" Byrnie said, with a boisterous laugh; "look at the picture now, Grattan! A beautiful little group of dogs, admirably handled, and speaking the artist in every line; but whether better or worse than Landseer, no more like him in any particular than Hogarth was like Titian. Genuine taste, indeed! Wait until some of <emph>your</emph> own pictures are submitted to the ordeal. Heavens!" he continued,<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6567-00000121"/> after a moment's pause; "you have damned yourself, Grattan, with <emph>this</emph> party, and must expect to be <emph>riddled</emph> whenever they get a chance at you."</p>
               <p>"Why, Byrnie, what in the world have I <emph>done?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Men don't like to have themselves exposed quite so publicly as asses," Byrnie replied, significantly.</p>
               <p>"I <emph>intended</emph> nothing to their disparagement; I was only intent upon finding out whether the poor author of the little picture was really in the city, and if so, do him a kindness, it possible. If they have taken serious offense at me for this they can recover at their leisure. If this is the kind of criticism. Art is to be subjected to, God save the artists!" he concluded, in an excited manner.</p>
               <p>"Amen!" ejaculated Byrnie, emphatically. "There is but little hope for Art until we have connoisseurs who not only have the feeling for Art, but are willing to make themselves somewhat at least acquainted with the means that artists have at their disposal to accomplish a given result."</p>
               <p>"Grattan," Mr. Mason interposed, "I am really sorry on your account, as well as the boy's, that this thing has occurred; but it perhaps could not have been avoided. I will do my best to sell this picture of your young friend, and if you will leave me your card, as I proposed, I will send the man to you who left it here, when he calls about it. "If," he added, kindly, "I can be of any service to you, command me."</p>
               <p>Both thanked him heartily for his kindness, and Grattan, leaving his address,—the two friends walked on to the establishment of Graves &amp; Denny, where Grattan made an arrangement for his frame without subjecting himself to any further mortification.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
               <head type="sub">GRATTAN'S INTERVIEW WITH GRANNY STILES—RELICS FROM A DECEASED MOTHER—INKLINGS ABOUT SHARKEY.</head>
               <p>IT will be readily understood that Mr. Grattan, once in possession of the facts contained in the last chapter, was uneasy and restless, and that his picture, although he had secured his frame without difficulty, progressed very slowly. He wanted to see Hugo, and ask him a thousand questions about home, which now came rushing upon his mind unbidden. How was his wife? how were the children? how were Dr. Draper and old Grey? and there were other questions which he wished to ask him in regard to a matter which continually harassed him, and (whatever were his hopes and prospects in regard to his profession) drove every other thought from his mind, leaving him often a prey almost to despair. Had anything been discovered in regard to Sharkey? Did people talk much about his disappearance? and had suspicion fixed upon any one as connected with it? These were the questions—full of fears—which he wished to propound more than all others; and several days having elapsed since the events above alluded to, without bringing the man who was to take him to Hugo, Mr. Grattan's excitement was intense, and work was impossible as long as he was in doubt as to his real condition. His own prospects were gloomy enough, and even the hope that he might be entering upon a better state of things, which had for a time buoyed him up, had almost vanished since the scene at Mason &amp; Carter's. Self was for the present forgotten in his anxiety for Hugo, and his desire to hear from home through him.<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6567-00000122"/> Every footstep he heard ascending the stairs he fancied to be the herald of the hack-driver's approach, and would sit listening eagerly, until the closing of some door below would satisfy him that the visit was not intended for him. He would take up his pallet and brushes and attempt to work, but threw them down again after a few moments, and stride back and forth across the room. Then his mind would revert for the thousandth time to the terrible circumstances under which he left his home, and leave him plunged in fits of gloomy abstraction, which no one, not even Byrnie, was allowed to interrupt. To him this conduct of Grattan's was of course a mystery which, looking upon the world from his stand-point, would be difficult to explain satisfactorily. For the hundredth time he had been puzzled by these sudden and unaccountable transitions of feeling on the part of his friend; but having once met with a severe rebuff by trying to penetrate the cause, he ceased to make further effort, and permitted Grattan to immure himself in his room as much and as often as he pleased. One thing, however, much as he flattered himself that he had subsided into indifference in regard to his movement, did still puzzle Byrnie not a little: often during Grattan's melancholy lapses he would leave his room, quietly and almost stealdily, early in the evening, and many times would not return until near morning. Knowing Grattan to be a man addicted to no vice which could explain this circumstance, a large amount of curiosity still lingered in Byrnie's mind in regard to this strange conduct.</p>
               <p>Let us—while he is still in suspense in regard to Hugo—follow Grattan on one of these mysterious night excursions.</p>
               <p>Wrapped in his cloak, the night dark and rainy, he has left his room, and is hurrying down Broadway, heedless alike of the rain and of the throng which jostle him on every side, but pressing forward with rapid steps, and with an expression of countenance painful to look upon, and a bearing which indicated most intense pre-occupation of mind. A few squares passed, he cautiously turns into a cross street, and after walking some distance, stops at the mouth of a little, narrow, crooked street or alley, so dark that no object is visible, and not a light to be seen in its mysterious zig-zags, between towering piles of brick and mortar, except one feeble lamp, which burned in front of some low tavern or grocery, some distance from him, and whose dim and sickly light scarcely struggled through the falling rain to the place where he stood. After looking cautiously around him, he dived suddenly down this dark avenue, and (dark as it was) seemed to have but little difficulty in finding his way. He did not proceed like one who finds himself, under such circumstances, in an entirely strange place, but pushed forward with confidence, rapidly, and only seeming anxious not to be observed. Passing the light we have mentioned, he turned abruptly into a narrow, filthy passage, between two gloomy buildings, and, after walking a few yards, began to feel along with his feet in the dark, and soon struck upon the first step of a flight of stairs which led down from the alley to underground rooms. Descending these steps in a hurried manner, and following along the area or narrow passage in which he found himself, he at length came to a low door, through the crevices of which a faint light was gleaming, as if it proceeded from an expiring fire, which sent forth a blaze for a moment, and then left the interior in perfect darkness. Standing a moment before this door, Grattan listened, but could hear no sound, and having apparently satisfied himself that it was safe to rap, he struck upon the door cautiously. No reply came to his summons, and after waiting a short time, he repeated his rap a little louder, and in a few moments he heard an inner door open, and some one approaching, until close to the door at which he stood, when a thin, sharp, disagreeable voice demanded—</p>
               <p>"Is that you, Jimmy?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, granny. Open the door quick; it is a horrible night," Mr. Grattan replied, familiarly.</p>
               <p>"I didn't much reckon on you to-night," said the old woman, undoing the door, "notwithstanding your promise to come, it rained so unaccountably."</p>
               <pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6567-00000123"/>
               <p>"It is a miserable night," Grattan replied, "and I am wet to the skin; let us get in where I can throw off my cloak."</p>
               <p>"You had better first take the basket, and go over to Natty's, and bring some coal—I have not enough to start a blaze."</p>
               <p>Thus counseled, Grattan took the basket, and going out, soon returned with a good supply, and the two retired into an inner apartment, where we will take the liberty to follow them.</p>
               <p>"Where is Ann?" Grattan asked, looking around the little room, which was dimly lighted by a few coals still glimmering upon the hearth.</p>
               <p>"Oh, she went out, Jimmy, some hour or two ago."</p>
               <p>"If she is likely to return soon, granny, with her devilish companions, I will not stay now, but come some other time."</p>
               <p>"She'll not be back much before morning," the old woman replied; "besides, you needn't turn up your nose at her or her companions; you 'tuck to the same milk' together once, Jimmy, and if her companions don't just suit you now, recollect, people <emph>must live.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Well, well, kindle up the fire, granny. I did not come to talk with you upon a subject which is unpleasant enough to dwell upon, and upon which I know you will not yield an inch. You know I am in no situation to do anything for you or the girl, or I would gladly do it."</p>
               <p>The coal which the old woman added to the fire soon began to burn brightly up and bring into relief the wretched and scanty furniture of the room. A miserable, low bed in one corner, with ragged quilts, which looked as if they had never seen water; an old rickety cupboard, which sustained a few cracked and broken dishes; two or three old stools; a table whose legs seemed ready to double up under its own weight, a tin box, half full of tobacco, and a few black and filthy pipes, constituted the furniture of the apartment.</p>
               <p>As these things were presented to Grattan's eyes, he turned with a shulder toward the old woman, who was now filling one of the pipes, and showed evident signs of embarrassment in his manner.</p>
               <p>"Well, Jimmy," she said at length, seating herself, and apparently understanding his peculiar frame of mind, and as if replying to his last remarks—"well, Jimmy, what <emph>did</emph> you come to talk to me about?"</p>
               <p>"You know very well, Granny Stiles," he replied, evidently vexed at the question, "that I came to try once more to persuade you to give up to me the things you say my mother left with you when she died. You certainly <emph>must have</emph> human sympathy enough to know what misery I suffer upon this subject."</p>
               <p>"Human feelin'," said the old woman, "may be nat'ral enough to some people, but I have told you a thousand times I hain't got a bit, unless," she added, "it's for money—that's <emph>the most powerful human feeling</emph> I'm acquainted with."</p>
               <p>"That may all be very true, granny, but there <emph>is</emph> such a feeling as affection—love; and you will understand that the love I bear that mother whose image has not yet faded from my memory, should make me anxious to possess the only relics which remain on earth of one whose career must have been bitter indeed, and who left her only son an inheritance of bitterness which has followed him to this day."</p>
               <p>"Why didn't you do as I wanted you to, Jimmy, instead of going mad about your paintin' and daubin', and then running away from me? If you had done so, we might still have been comfortably living by the sea-side in a nice little cottage, with all that we needed in plenty around us."</p>
               <p>"I have told you my reasons, granny, and it is of no use to repeat them. Suffice it, the life of a wrecker I did not like nor approve, and as you were disposed to act tyrannically with me, I ran away. Whether I am better or worse off, has nothing to do with my present visit, and we shall neither of us gain anything by retrospection. I came to-night again to beg of you, as you value my peace of mind, to give me whatever you may have in your keeping that belonged to my mother. You say that it was her express wish, on her death-bed, that these things should be given to me, and why will you not do so?"</p>
               <pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6567-00000124"/>
               <p>"I have told you, often and often," the old woman replied, "that I was satisfied that your mother's husband, whoever he may be, was a rich <emph>big buy,</emph> and that I did not want to lose these things in case any one—for instance, your father—should turn up, and inquire for you."</p>
               <p>"But what possible good can they do you even in such an event?" said Grattan, losing patience. "I may be dead, or you may have lost sight of me, and unless you can tell where I am, I do not see what good they will do you."</p>
               <p>"I shall not lose sight of you," she remarked, with a peculiar expression; "and don't you think your friends would 'count down' pretty handsome to know all that I have in my keeping? Oh, no, I shan't lose sight of you—you can be sure of that. I know all about you, and have known all about you for two years, at least; although," she said, in a low voice, "we had pretty hard work to find you."</p>
               <p>"What do you mean by we?" Grattan cried, starting from his seat. "In God's name, tell me, has anybody inquired of you about me?"</p>
               <p>"Sit down, now, Jimmy; don't get into a stew. I don't always know what I'm talking about."</p>
               <p>"But," he exclaimed, his excitement increasing, "you said something about its being hard to find me; what did you mean by that?"</p>
               <p>"Why," she replied, "it would naturally be hard to find a wild, devilish boy who hadn't been seen nor heard on for some years, wouldn't it?"</p>
               <p>"Granny Stiles, I know that you are deceiving me, but for what purpose I can not tell. Just think," he proceeded, while large drops rolled down his cheeks; "you might die, and these little relics of my poor mother might forever be lost to me; they can do you no possible good, and may be of immense value to me."</p>
               <p>"If I die, I have made arrangements by which you are certain to get them," the old woman replied; "but while I live I will keep them; and if there is anything to be made out of the secret I hold, I mean to have it. I never got anything for nussin' and raisin' ye, and unless I get it in some such way, I never <emph>shall</emph> get anything."</p>
               <p>Grattan here threw himself forward upon the table and wept without restraint, while the old woman sat looking on with the utmost indifference, pulling away at her pipe with the air of one who was at peace with the world. "Jimmy," she finally said, finding that he continued to indulge his grief, "you don't s'pose I'd act like a nat'ral born fool, and give up these things for nothin' after keepin' them so long?"</p>
               <p>"How much, Granny Stiles, would induce you to give them up to me?" Grattan asked.</p>
               <p>"Who-ee!" she cried, laughing, "you couldn't begin to buy them. Something will turn up some day, Jimmy, and then it will all come out right. It's no use for you to fret so; it won't do any good."</p>
               <p>"Well, old woman, I can tell you for certain, that they will do you no good after I am gone. Even my father, if he should turn up, as you seem to anticipate, would give you nothing for them, unless they gave him a clew to my where-abouts."</p>
               <p>"Very true; but you ain't dead yet, by a long ways, Jimmy!"</p>
               <p>"I shall be, though, granny, before long, if things continue to press as heavily upon me as they have done. I can't stand it much longer; and before I will return to Kate and the children, without having bettered my circumstances, I will lay violent hands upon myself, and you can then do what you like with those things."</p>
               <p>"Jimmy!" the old woman hurriedly exclaimed, running up to him in evident alarm, "you arn't in airnest! If you are hard up for money," and she looked around her cautiously, as she said this, "I wouldn't mind lendin' you a little."</p>
               <p>"No, I thank you," Grattan replied; "I want none of <emph>your</emph> money. I have but one favor to ask of <emph>you,</emph> and if you won't grant that, this visit has been as profitless as all the rest."</p>
               <p>"Nonsense, Jimmy; don't talk any more about <emph>that.</emph> I shan't give the things to you <emph>now,</emph> that's certain; but to keep<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6567-00000125"/> you in good spirits, and prevent you from committing murder on yourself, I will tell you that I <emph>know</emph> that your father is rich, or that you have rich relations somewhere."</p>
               <p>"Why, what makes you cling so tenaciously to this hope?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"I will tell you," she answered, drawing her seat nearer to him; "some two years ago or more, when I was still living down on the sea-shore there, at ——, there came to me one day a sharp villain of a looking fellow, who inquired all about a certain vessel which had been wrecked on the coast years before; and finding—" she said, "to make a long story short—that a lady and her son had been saved, and that they had stayed with me until her death, he came down and pumped me about it for a week, every day, and finally told me that so great was his interest in finding out where you was, that he would make me comfortable for life if I could give him a clew to find you. Well, we set to work, and the letters you had written to me from time to time, askin' for those things of your mother's, helped us very much, and we traced you first to Boston, then to New Haven, then to Baltimore, and the last letter I get from you was some three years ago, from Montreal, Canada, and telling me that you were moored, and had a family. Mr. Sharkey—"</p>
               <p>"Sharkey!" Grattan exclaimed, interrupting her; "Oh, God! what does this mean? Well, go on."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Sharkey (that was the man's name, Jimmy) started with this information, and traced you up, I don't know how, and has corresponded with me regularly, until some six or eight months ago it was broke off, and—"</p>
               <p>"Yes!" Grattan exclaimed, breaking in again upon her, "and it will now stay broken off, most likely; Sharkey is dead!"</p>
               <p>"Dead?" she asked, with a start; "it must have been very lately, then, for I received another letter from him not more than three weeks ago!"</p>
               <p>"Stop <unclear>there</unclear>, granny!" Grattan cried out, starting wildly forward; "you can not practice any such game as this upon <emph>me!</emph> I know that Sharkey is dead, and what motive you can have for telling me such a tissue of lies as this, is more than I can divine."</p>
               <p>"Here is his letter," said the old woman, drawing it out of her pocket, "and it ain't, sartan, over three weeks' old; I'd jist as live you'd read it as not," she continued, "for he hasn't paid me as he promised, at all."</p>
               <p>Grattan took the letter, and read as follows:</p>

                           <p>GRANNY STILES—My plans are all frustrated, but you must scrupulously preserve the information you hold in regard to Grattan, as it will be called for before long by one who is fully as much, if not <emph>more,</emph> interested than I am.</p>

               <p>At the conclusion of this letter, Grattan fell back in his chair, so entirely bewildered by what he read, that it was some time before he could speak. He at length said to the old woman: "This is either a cruel, miserable game to drive me mad, or there is some mystery at the bottom, which is beyond my comprehension."</p>
               <p>"There, now," the old woman exclaimed, without apparently noticing his extraordinary excitement, "would you axe me to give these things up in the 'face and eyes' of that? Why, it may be the means of making me and Ann easy for life."</p>
               <p>"Whether there is truth, or not, at the bottom of all this, I can not tell," Grattan replied, rising to go, "but it will evidently be explained too late to do me any good; I will not live in this way."</p>
               <p>"Why, Jimmy," said the old woman, "if you want money, I can let you have some; and, as I said before, everything will come out right in the end."</p>
               <p>"I don't want any of your money, granny," he said, bitterly, walking toward the door, "and I have the best of reasons for believing that you are the dupe of some one; for what purpose I can not tell."</p>
               <pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6567-00000126"/>
               <p>"Oh! it's Sharkey's writin', as sure as you are born," the old woman persisted; "it's just like all his other letters."</p>
               <p>"Very well, old woman; if Sharkey <emph>is</emph> alive, as this letter seems to indicate, I would blow my brains out at a moment's warning, before I would again fall into his hands." With these words upon his lips and a whirlwind of excitement upon his brain, Grattan hurriedly retraced his steps, and spent the balance of the night in pacing up and down in his room, revolving in his mind the strange occurrences at Granny Stiles's.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
               <head type="sub">SOCIAL EVILS—A COLLOQUY—GLOOM VS. HUMOR—TOADYISM VS. DIGNITY.</head>
               <p>IT would be an easy task, not only to write a book, but to multiply volumes, upon the subject of the money-making spirit which forms so large an element in our national characteristics—the crushing effect it has upon some classes; the heartlessness it develops in others; and the total extinction of <emph>real</emph> sympathy of one class with another, which it often occasions. We could show with what feelings of disgust and indignation, intellect and refinement look upon purse-proud ignorance and imbecility. We could show the respectable aristocratic <emph>practical</emph> man many times guilty of worse crimes, in his eagerness to accumulate wealth, than that which doomed a fellow-creature, driven by necessity, to a dreary prison for months—perhaps years. We could show by what imperceptible stages all classes are becoming mere speculators, and how even beardless boys have become, by the force of example, accomplished and popular rascals. We could show how monster crimes and abuses become familiar by being winked at. We could show how the nation shuts its eyes to the plottings of gangs of political pirates who try to involve us in difficulties abroad, while another class of cormorants prey upon the public cribs at home. We could show that our Legislatures and our Congress are little better than gambling saloons on a large scale, kept up at the public expense, where politicians gamble for fat spoils and divide among themselves the revenues of the nation, while efforts for the advancement of any objects<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6567-00000127"/> which are of real national importance are treated with contempt and decision. We could show how loose, under our system of practical training, are becoming the reins of morality and religion; and how "Young America," the most popular idea of the day, has taken the "bit in his teeth" and is running away with the ears of State. We could show how Art and her hungry, lean, hollow-eyed votaries are dependent upon such a public taste as can be generated in such an atmosphere, while the tricky and successful knave suns himself complacently in the smiles of his thousand abject worshipers. We could show you men building princely palaces in every city in the Union, who have been countenanced for years in criminal schemes for accumulating money, by poisoning what little of life there is yet remaining in the wretched invalids of the land, through the sale of their worthless nostrums; and we could take you only a few squares from these palaces, and show you genius and merit starving, or subsisting upon a bare pittance. We could show you the miserable creatures who are swallowing these vile mixtures by the pint and quart, who would throw the prescription of an honest, educated, conscientious physician into the fire. We could show you the sterling men and women of the country, as helpless and hopeless as if about to be plunged over the brink of Niagara by the resistless waters, fearfully noting the unchecked torrent of popular prejudices and follies, as it rushes by to bury our beloved nation and its honors in the abyss of anarchy and civil discord. We could show you a large portion of the editors of the country, who wield resistless power, abusing the same by prostituting the press to the basest uses, while they, as sentinels upon the watch towers of the nation, are quietly folding their arms and crying "All's well!"</p>
               <p>All these things we could tell in lengthened and sickering detail, but it is sufficient for the purposes of our story barely to touch upon them. And let no man say that one who expresses such sentiments has no love of his country! It is the love of country that opens the eyes to abuses and prompts to speak fearlessly. It is the love of country that looks into the future in the hope of finding there something to beget and foster hope. The men who are the least conspicuous; the men who are ridiculed as "old fogies," and scoffed at as conservatives, it would be much safer and wiser to trust at the helm of State, than the dishonest, thieving tricksters who too frequently figure in public places and riot upon public patronage and favor. Do you think, worthy reader, that <emph>they</emph> are influenced by love of country? Do you think it would make any difference to them whether king, emperor, pirate, or highwayman controlled our destinies, provided <emph>their</emph> "bread is buttered," and kept buttered? Not a whit!</p>
               <p>And now, before going on with my story, let me ask how is Art to flourish in such an atmosphere, or the worshipers at her altars to be other than they are? Is it not a burning disgrace that a nation which could have a larger surplus revenue than any on earth, should make no effort to foster and encourage <emph>National</emph> Art? Is not a shame that a press, whose influence is world-wide, should sell itself to the highest bidder, and pander to any sort of political iniquity, but gives no word of encouragement to those influences which are among the most potent in human elevation, or use a portion of its power for the advancement of general taste?</p>
               <p>The artists of my story are no creatures of the imagination, conjured up to startle the reader or excite his sympathy, but have their starving prototypes in every large city in the Union. The generous reader will excuse digressions for the expression of honest and earnest feelings, and we will return to those who are suffering from the abuses which have called forth these remarks.</p>
               <p>The morning after the scene narrated in the last chapter found Byrnie pounding at Grattan's door with a vigor and determination which threatened to drive it from its hinges. After repeated summons the door was at length opened by Grattan, who looked feverish and careworn, and who had evidently passed the night without sleep.</p>
               <p>Byrnie's countenance fell the moment his friend appeared, and to the look of sympathy which it at once assumed was<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC6567-00000128"/> added one of inquiry and perplexity. With a warm, sarguine temperament himself, seldom clouded with melancholy, he could not comprehend how Grattan could be so weighed down. He was fully alive to all the perplexities and vexations of their profession, but <emph>he</emph> never got the blues or dumps over <emph>that</emph>, and he could not see why any one else should. He had his wretched quarters, scanty fare, threadbare garments, empty pockets, and all that, but <emph>he</emph> didn't allow this to crush his spirits or shut out hope. Why should Grattan? To be sure, Grattan had a family dependent upon him, but even this could not account to Byrnie for the constant bitterness of his friend, and that impenetrable cloud of melancholy which enveloped him.</p>
               <p>"What the d——l can ail the man?" he asked himself a hundred times a day to no purpose; and, as we have said before, there came now these mysterious night-absences, which no doubt contained the key to the mystery of his strange conduct.</p>
               <p>He stood a moment in the door, looking earnestly at Grattan while these thoughts were passing rapidly through his mind; then, pressing his hand,  said to him, in the hope of arousing him from his evident depression: "Come, Grattan; cheer up! cheer up! I have got some good news for you this time. I have found your young friend and we are to visit him this evening."</p>
               <p>"Oh!" Grattan exclaimed, "the man has been here?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; he came last night after you went out, and said that he would call for us at seven o'clock this evening, as he could not go home before that time."</p>
               <p>"How is Hugo, now?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! the man said htat he was sitting up now, and had, during his convalescence, nearly painted a picture; so, if this is true, he can not be very bad now. He seemed strangely attached to your young friend."</p>
               <p>"He could not well help that, Byrnie; Hugo is as noble a boy as ever lived, and the greatest crime he ever committed was in becoming an artist. He should have gone on as his father desired him to do, and by this would have been an adept in licensed stealing, or, to use a less offensive term, in business."</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha! ha!" Byrnie shouted, but checking himself, immediately added: "excuse me, Grattan, you make me laugh; even your bitterness has something comical in it to me, however true and pointed, you say things in such deadly earnest."</p>
               <p>"I don't blame you for laughing, Byrnie; God knows I would like to laugh heartily myself once in a while, but I have some stern facts to contend with that have out little humor in them, I assure you."</p>
               <p>"Excuse me, Grattan," Byrnie replied, in an altered voice; "I did not reflect that my humor this morning may be very ill-timed."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no! Byrnie; your sallies of wit and humor are refreshing to me, and have done me already a great deal of good. Had it not been for you, Heaven only knows what my melancholy might have led me to do. I have found in you a friend indeed, and believe me, I appreciate the motive which I think has influenced you."</p>
               <p>"Well, my friend, I am certainly gratified by your good opinion, and am pleased that you still license my nonsense. If I could not indulge it I should die, for the very fun and humor I see in everything keeps me in good spirits, and enables me to pass over things with a joke which would make you miserable for a week. I don't believe, positively, I could go to a funeral without finding something to laugh at, and a visit to church would throw me into convulsions. I wish you had a <emph>little</emph> of this disposition, Mr. Grattan; it would do you good, upon my word."</p>
               <p>"No doubt it would, Byrnie, but you and I have very different temperaments. Yours is all sunshine, and mine, unfortunately, all gloom. You see the same evils that I do, but to laugh at and ridicule them, while to me they are constant sources of pain and unhappiness. Besides all this, I have<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC6567-00000129"/> other troubles which you know nothing about, and which I only mention that you may not think me quite a 'gone misanthrope.'" These last words were uttered with a trembling voice, and Byrnie felt more and more puzzled the more he saw and heard. He laid his hand upon Grattan's arm when he had done, and said:</p>
               <p>"Well, by Jove! Grattan, don't let us talk any more in this confounded way. I've told you dozens of times <emph>it don't yield any per-centage,</emph> and the more I see of it the more I think so. If we continue our friendly intercourse, one of us will have to be swallowed up in the other. Either I shall become as blue as indigo, or you will come to think and look upon things as I do, and you may rest assured I shall fight for the predominance of my own feelings and views, however eccentric. So let's have a fair field and a free fight."</p>
               <p>Grattan <emph>did</emph> smile at this, and giving him his hand, accepted the proffered combat, with the hope that Byrnie might win.</p>
               <p>"Now, to change the subject," Byrnie went on, "I forgot to tell you that my picture is done, and will be hung in the gallery to-day. You had better finish yours as soon as possible, for the same purpose. The committee will meet on Monday evening next, and they may both be sold, in which case one 'Byrnie, artist,' will imbibe sundry potations to 'better days, and many of them.'"</p>
               <p>"I shall varnish my picture to-day, Byrnie, get the frame home this evening, and send it to the gallery to-morrow. I pray God your hopes may be realized, but I anticipate nothing."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps, Grattan, it is well that it is so. If you don't sell your picture, you won't feel so much disappointment. But I have something else to tell you. Adolphe Rembrandt Tucker sold yesterday, to the Hon. Peter Cognovit, for one hundred dollars (think of that, Grattan—one hundred dollars!), that wretched daub we were looking at the other day, yelept 'Lear.'"</p>
               <p>"What does this mean?" Grattan asked, turning to him with a look of surprise.</p>
               <p>"Simply, I suppose, a desire his Honor felt to show 'Mr. Grattan, artist, fourth floor,' that he has fallen under the ban of his displeasure."</p>
               <p>"When did this happen, Byrnie?"</p>
               <p>"Yesterday afternoon, after the scene at Mason &amp; Carter's?"</p>
               <p>"All I have to say to that, Byrnie, is, that the Hon. gentleman is putting himself to considerable trouble for nothing. I have no patrons, and who does he expect to influence?"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps no one, my friend; but it has, no doubt, afforded him great pleasure to indicate to you, in this <emph>delicate</emph> manner, that the Hon. Peter is <emph>able</emph> to buy pictures, and might, if he felt so disposed, aid Mr. Grattan somewhat. This is <emph>my</emph> interpretation of his conduct, but I may be mistaken. Suppose he should use his influence with the committee to prevent the sale of your pictures to the Art Union?"</p>
               <p>"Could he prevent their sale, Byrnie?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know that he could, Grattan, but he is one of the directors, and has an undoubted standing as a connoisseur. I only make these suggestions, that you may be on your guard not to give the gentleman any further offense."</p>
               <p>"Supposing that your suspicious are well grounded, Byrnie, what am I to do?"</p>
               <p>"Toady, Grattan—by Heavens! toady," Byrnie exclaimed, in an excited voice. "That is all that is now left for us poor devils to <emph>do.</emph> Don't you remark how gracefully I doff my beaver, (or rather <emph>felt</emph>), and how profoundly I bow whenever I meet his Honor, or any one else connected, however remotely, with the Art Union—even their miserable man-of-all-work? Lord! I'll black all their boots, if they will only buy my pictures."</p>
               <p>"Well, Byrnie," Grattan answered moodily, "I shall do no such thing; and if the Hon. Peter Cognovit chooses to visit his wrath upon me for so trifling a cause, and the Art Union are influenced by him to do me injustice, I would see the whole establishment sunk to the bottomless pit, and his Honor with it, before I would bow to one of them to secure a favor.<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6567-00000130"/> If my pictures have merit, it is my right to be compensated for them, if they have means to purchase."</p>
               <p>"You'll get bravely over all that kind of fine stuff," Byrnie exclaimed, laughingly, "when you have been in the city long enough to know the value of a little 'upper-ten' patronage. Why, my dear fellow, a commission from Peter Cognovit or old Grabb would fill Broadway with the equipages of your ardent admirers, and you might retire at the end of a couple of years upon a fortune. There is no 'bread-and-water' in this picture, Grattan, and wouldn't such a consummation pay for playing toady a little?"</p>
               <p>"Heavens! Byrnie, how can you treat this matter with so much indifference? I should think it would make your blood boil."</p>
               <p>"That might do very well in cold weather, Grattan, but not now. Why, Lord! my good fellow, I went to a party at old Grabb's, last winter, without a shirt, my coat buttoned up to the throat, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">à la militaire,</foreign> and a paper shirt-collar, as the sham representative of something I could not then afford. It was a cold night, and a little boiling of the blood would have helped the thing out. But somehow I can never boil nor freeze when I ought to, I suppose." Grattan laughed, in spite of himself, at Byrnie's humor, and he went on: "Let me illustrate, now, the effect of a little well-directed toadying. It ain't of the least use to try to throw any dignity around art or artists, where, as is the case here, a bit of gold-leaf as big as your thumb-nail will hide any amount of sin and iniquity. I went to old Grabb's party, as I tell you, a fair illustration of our sham society, without a shirt, borrowed my coat from one friend, my pants and boots from another, and pawned three pictures for the loan of an eye-glass. Well, Grattan, in this way I strutted about old Grabb's parlor with the air and magnificent bearing of a millionaire—puffed his pictures, puffed his elegant parlors and furniture, puffed him, puffed his taste, danced with his daughter, praised her little hand (which, by-the-way, pricked my conscience a little), paid divers little <emph>unpremeditated</emph> attentions to the old lady, and finally, just before leaving, ventured to hint to the old fool that there was a vacancy on his parlor wall which ought to be filled with a fine landscape."</p>
               <p>"All to no purpose, Byrnie."</p>
               <p>"The next morning, my beloved friend, Mr. George Byrnie (your humble servant) received a hundred-dollar order from Grabb, accompanied by a check on Grabb, Holdfast &amp; Co., for half the amount in advance. Oh, you'll get used to it, Grattan; it's the only way to get hold of these people who have vanity and money, without taste or sense. You'll soon learn to sell yourself to the devil for a small compensation, as all the rest of the world do, and give up your ideas of dignifying Art and elevating artists. I am an artist for the times, Grattan, and you are an artist for some other time, the Lord only knows whether past or to come—not for this day and generation, that's certain. I'm <emph>practical,</emph> sir," he continued, sticking his thumbs in his vest, and strutting about the room, while Grattan, no longer able to control himself, laughed outright. "I'll sell my pictures for nails, beeswax, hominy, cornmeal, or any other commodity that can readily be converted into the circulating medium, while I have heard you grumble because a merchant patron once made you take your pay for some landscapes in calicoes and flummery. Come down to the times, Grattan. It's entirely too big a lift to try to get them up to you."</p>
               <p>"And you can be happy yet, under such circumstances, Byrnie?" Grattan asked, looking at him in astonishment.</p>
               <p>"Why, certainly I can. The hundred dollars I told you I got of old Grabb has been gone these three months, and I've not sold one of my pictures since, although the pawnbrokers' shops are full of them."</p>
               <p>"You are the most remarkable man of your time, Byrnie," Grattan exclaimed again.</p>
               <p>"No! I am no such thing, Grattan; there are dozens just like me in the city, and dozens just like you, but we stand grief much better than you and your party. We are the philosophers. However," he suddenly exclaimed, "I don't know as this is very complimentary, for they say that there<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6567-00000131"/> are now-a-days only <emph>two kinds</emph> of philosophers—<emph>fools</emph> and <emph>suicides!</emph>"</p>
               <p>As Byrnie concluded this sentence, and turned, laughing, to Grattan, his mood was suddenly changed. Grattan was staring at him wildly and as pale as death, and it suddenly flashed through Byrnie's mind that he might, perhaps, at some time have meditated, or was even now meditating suicide himself; and feeling self-accused for the sentiments he had expressed, he ran forward, and, taking his hand, exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"Excuse me, Grattan! Forgive me! I have, as usual, forgotten, in my effort to raise <emph>your</emph> spirits, the difference in our circumstances. I have said something to wound your feelings. It was thoughtless—not intentional, my friend—and I hope you will forgive it."</p>
               <p>This sudden display of feeling on Byrnie's part only increased his friend's embarrassment, and he turned away and walked once or twice across the room in the greatest excitement. Was he fearful that Byrnie had read him right, reader, or was he affected only by some painful reflections which this rattling, random tirade had called up? However this may be, he turned presently to Byrnie, and with a face <emph>now</emph> crimson, instead of pallid, said, in a hurried voice—</p>
               <p>"It is nothing, Byrnie; I was only thinking that <emph>I</emph> might be happy and careless, too, if no one depended upon my exertions except myself. This is all; don't <emph>think of this</emph> again, I beg of you."</p>
               <p>"Agreed, Grattan," Byrnie responded; "we will neither of us think any more of it. I can not promise that I shall not make a fool of myself again, however, as this is my province. Now, Grattan, suppose we take the rounds of the galleries to brighten our ideas for the day's labors? and when our man comes again with the carriage this evening, I hope we shall both be in good spirits to meet your young friend."</p>
               <p>As was the custom with many artists at the time we speak of, our two friends spent the morning among, the pictures, and returned about ten o'clock to their rooms, where they were employed until evening.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">VISIT TO HUGO—JOE TYSON AND HIS FAMILY—THE INTERVIEW.</head>
               <p>SEVEN o'clock came, and with it Joe Tyson, the carriage-driver, who found Grattan and Byrnie discussing the merits of the collections they had been visiting in the morning, and who announced to them that his "vihicle was below, and if the gents would ride, he'd set them down right at his door." Byrnie and Grattan were not long in getting ready; the latter bustled about with alacrity, and evinced more interest in the contemplated visit to Hugo than he had shown in anything since his arrival in New York. As they were going down stairs, Grattan said to the driver—</p>
               <p>"Did you tell the young man that we were coming?"</p>
               <p>"Not a word of it," he replied. "The young cove has been wishing and inquiring about a Mr. Graunthem or Grattan, or some such name, and I s'pose that's yourself; but I have never let on that I had seen or heard of you, and only promised that when he was better I would take him out and try to hunt you up."</p>
               <p>"Then," said Byrnie, "we shall take him by surprise."</p>
               <p>"Entirely, sir; and I told the old 'oman to get a little tea ready, and," he added, touching his hat, "if it's agreeable to the gentlemen, they shall sup and spend the evening with the young lad."</p>
               <p>"With pleasure," Grattan exclaimed; but Byrnie, more impetuous in his nature, seized Joe by the hand, and said, enthusiastically—</p>
               <p>"My good fellow, whatever the mass of mankind may be,<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC6567-00000132"/> you're a brick, that's certain, and thousands might make an example of you with profit to themselves."</p>
               <p>"Well," the man replied, as they stepped out upon the pavement, "here's the carriage. Gentlemen, step in; you'll find that Joe Tyson allers tries to do right."</p>
               <p>"Here's a miracle, Grattan; he says he always tries to do right;" and, turning to Joe, and tapping him on the shoulder, added, "there are not ten men in New York who can say as much."</p>
               <p>"Step in," Joe replied, shortly, pointing to the carriage; "wait till you see how the young chap fares, before you promise. We tried to do our best, and that's not over much."</p>
               <p>Grattan and Byrnie stepped into the carriage, and were soon whirling away through the streets at a rapid pace, and they entered into a lively conversation about the driver's plain honesty and kind-heartedness, and expressed mutual wonder that it should exist in a man whose employment had but little in it to elevate, and whose associations were most likely calculated to degrade him. Especially was Grattan pleased to find that the man seemed so warmly attached to Hugo, and his own heart warmed and expanded in the anticipation of a happy evening. Byrnie was also evidently in good spirits, to which the rapid motion of the carriage, the whirling throng through which they were threading their way, and the constant excitement, contributed not a little. To tell the truth, it had been a long time since he had enjoyed the pleasure of a ride of any kind, and the exuberance of his feelings escaped in all sorts of quilps and jokes at the passers-by who were within hailing distance.</p>
               <p>"By Jove! Grattan," he exclaimed, "look there! as I am a poor devil, there goes Adolph Rembrandt Tucker, with old Grabb's daughter; there, don't you see?—in that carriage; there, they are just turning the corner—ha! ha! ha! Adolphus Rembrandt Tucker's fortune is made! Heavens! won't he have a spicy twist to his moustache when he appears at his studio in the morning?"</p>
               <p>"Let us be thankful, Byrnie, that one of the class artist is getting some reward for his labor, if he is an ass."</p>
               <p>"Certainly," said Byrnie; "and if there is much more of a rush to his rooms, <emph>I</emph> will don a pair of long ears, and see how they'll win. Hallo! what's this?" he exclaimed, as the carriage suddenly pulled up in a narrow street. "Lord! but this <emph>is</emph> a narrow, dark place. It ain't Fifth Avenue, certainly. I wonder where we are? Did you ever see such by-ways as he has taken us through, Grattan?"</p>
               <p>"This here is the place," said the driver from the box, breaking in upon Byrnie's questions; "just get out, gents; turn into the alley there, by the lamp-post, and knock at the first door on the right. I'll drive the carriage to the stand, and be back in a few minutes."</p>
               <p>Thus directed, the two soon found themselves in a dark, narrow alley, in front of a low door, beneath which they could see the flickering of a light, which burned within; and after pausing a moment to stamp the dust from their feet and brush it from their clothes, Grattan knocked at the door.</p>
               <p>Some little bustle was heard within, and presently the door was opened by a little girl, who stood with a light held above her head, and looked out into the passage, from beneath it, with one of the prettiest smiles playing about her little mouth that ever greeted a stranger at the door.</p>
               <p>"Good-evening, my little lassie," said Byrnie. "Does Mr. Tyson live in these rooms?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, this is the place; mother has been looking for you. Hugo is sitting up in the big rocking-chair, in the other room."</p>
               <p>Mr. Grattan hardly waited to hear her through. Something in the little girl's manner reminded him of past scenes, and he involuntarily caught her up in his arms, and exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"God bless your little heart, Mary! I know you are a good girl."</p>
               <p>"How did you know my name was Mary?" the girl asked, with a look of surprise.</p>
               <p>"Did I say Mary?" Grattan asked, as much surprised as<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC6567-00000133"/> herself. "Well, I suppose something told me it was, or ought to be, Mary."</p>
               <p>Here a neatly dressed young woman appeared at the door, and seeing the little girl in Grattan's arms, said: "Why, Mary, Mary, you must not be so rude."</p>
               <p>"Not at all rude, Mrs. Tyson. Her sweet little face moved me so much that I caught her up involuntarily. It is no fault of hers. I have a Mary myself at home," he continued, sadly, by way of apology for his own conduct, "who was once almost a counterpart of your little Mary."</p>
               <p>"Well, come in, gentlemen, and lay off your things. Mary, jump down, and run into the other room and tell Hugo that some gentlemen are coming in to see him. Follow her into that room," she added to them, pointing to a door where the active little herald had already disappeared.</p>
               <p>Grattan and Byrnie were not slow in following, and as they crossed the threshold, they saw Hugo eagerly leaning forward in the great rocking-chair where he was seated, listening to Mary's bustling, childish announcement with an expression in which curiosity and surprise were curiously blended; and as the two friends appeared behind her at the door, he rose with an effort to his feet, and with a cry of joy held forth both his hands toward Grattan, who eagerly ran to him, and almost embraced him, with many joyful expressions of pleasure at the meeting. It would have been hard to tell which of the two was most happy. Hugo could with difficulty restrain his tears, as Grattan led him back to his seat, where he stood bent over him, but little less excited himself, while Byrnie was busy examining some rude ornaments upon the mantle piece, and occasionally wiping his eyes with his handkerchief.</p>
               <p>"Heavens, Hugo!" Grattan exclaimed at length, drawing back and looking at him, "how you have changed! How long is it since you were hurt?"</p>
               <p>"Three weeks, Monday next," Hugo answered; "but, Mr. Grattan, I am much better than I have been, thanks to these excellent people."</p>
               <p>"You have, indeed, been fortunate," said Grattan, looking around the room, which was neat and cleanly as possible. "Oh, excuse me, this is Mr. Byrnie, Hugo, one of our artists, who has taken an interest in you from hearing me talk so much about you, and has come with me this evening to see you."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Mr. Byrnie," said Hugo, extending his hand; "I hope, if Mr. Grattan has said anything good of me, I may prove deserving of it."</p>
               <p>"No doubt you will; but tell us how it was that this accident occurred, which has laid you up, as you say, for three weeks?"</p>
               <p>Hugo here related the whole circumstance, and told them how Joe Tyson had taken him up, and refused to let him be sent to the hospital, as the bystanders had proposed; and how kind Joe's wife and the little Mary had been to him; and how his toast and tea were prepared by them as carefully as his own mother and sister could have done it; how his chair was arranged with pillows and bolsters every morning, that he might sit up comfortably while his bed was being made; how, when he got well enough to sit up all day, Joe had gone to work, with his instruction, and made him a rude easel, bought a blank canvas, and set him to work, as he said, "to keep him from feeling lonesome." In short, how they had all seemed to vie with each other in acts of kindness. "This little thing," he said, in conclusion, laying his hand on the little girl's head, who stood leaning against him—"this little thing has never left me a minute; she has been my good angel. She is as sweet a little girl as ever lived," he added, kissing her fair brow.</p>
               <p>Byrnie's warm Irish heart was so much moved by this little scene, that while he smiled with pleasure, there was a gleam of moisture in his eyes; and when Hugo had finished, he caught the little girl in his arms, and, kissing her fondly, said: "Mary, you will be a bright little angel one of these days, to glad the heart, I hope, of some one who will appreciate you."</p>
               <p>"Mother says we are all to be angels up there in the sky,"<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6567-00000134"/> she answered, not comprehending Byrnie's remark, and pointing upward with her plump little hand.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Mary, you will be an angel there, that's certain, or there are no such things as angels."</p>
               <p>At this point Joe came bustling into the room, and the little girl jumped down from Byrnie's arms, and, bounding across the room, sprang into those of her father, who folded her fondly to his heart, as he said—</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, this is the kind of a bird to meet a fellow when he comes home after a hard day's work. Bless your little heart! what have you been doing all day?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, you've been taking care of me, haven't you, Mary?" Hugo asked.</p>
               <p>"Yes," she replied, "and looking at him making that pretty picture."</p>
               <p>"Well, Mary," said Joe, "let us go and see mother, while these gentlemen are talking about their own matters. Make yourselves at home," he added, as he was going out.</p>
               <p>Hugo and Grattan were soon deeply interested in conversation about home (while Byrnie examined, at the table, Hugo's portfolio of sketches), and much that was interesting to both was fully canvassed. They talked of the past, and when the pleasant as well as painful memories attached to this subject were exhausted, Mr. Grattan adverted to the present, and dwelt with melancholy interest upon his gloomy prospects and desperate circumstances.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Grattan," said Hugo, "don't dwell upon this unpleasant subject. I have always told you how firmly <emph>I</emph> hoped for better things, and I am satisfied that my hopes will eventually prove realities. You will yet take enviable rank as an artist, and you do serious harm to yourself to dwell so continually on the gloomy side of the picture."</p>
               <p>"Hugo, you are the master of sunshine, and you should touch my gloomy pictures occasionally; but I fear that your sunny view of life would make of such a picture a very unpleasing patchwork. The sun, my dear young friend, will not shine through impenetrable clouds. There is a weight upon my heart which will not be lifted up by an effort of the will."</p>
               <p>Hugo gazed earnestly at him as he spoke, and was struck with his altered appearance, which testified to a world of suffering endured without sympathy, and which had been gradually wearing him away. And he wondered if his friend had not other griefs than those which he conversed with him about so freely. Mr. Grattan, noticing his earnest look, took his hand again, and added, as if in continuation of his last remark—"I don't know, Hugo, but the effort would, at least, do me good, and I will try, if it is only to please you."</p>
               <p>"Do, Mr. Grattan, do!" Hugo answered, earnestly; and, returning the pressure of his hand, "I am to act as your good genius. We are to talk together, work together, live together, and divide what we have. I am in luck to-day," he continued, while a warm smile played about his mouth, "and you must accept your half of that good fortune. The little group of dogs which I brought with me and sent up by Joe to sell, some days ago, and which he says set you on the hunt for me, sold yesterday, by some unaccountable circumstance for twenty dollars. Now, I shall have no use for money until I can safely venture about, and it would be wrong for me to keep it idle. You must favor me by taking half of it, until some of your pictures sell. The other half I forced upon Joe, who, generous fellow, was unwilling to take anything for all the trouble I have given them." As he concluded, he quietly but decidedly passed the bills into Mr. Grattan's hand, and immediately asked, as if to prevent him from indulging any unpleasant feelings: "Oh, you must see what I have been working at; wouldn't you like to see my new picture, Mr. Grattan?"</p>
               <p>"Not to-night, Hugo—not to-night; it can not be seen to any advantage by candle-light, and I shall be here now every day. You are the very impersonation of nobleness, Hugo," he added, in a low voice; "but I would not take this money on any account, did I not know that I can, at least, raise <emph>that</emph> sum when you need it."</p>
               <pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6567-00000135"/>
               <p>"Don't talk about that, Mr. Grattan. Tell me all about the galleries and the fine pictures that are to be seen here—the statuary, picture-shops, National Academy, Art Union, and a hundred other places I have read about, but never seen."</p>
               <p>This and the story of Hugo's journey from C—— to New York naturally opened up pleasant topics, upon which they delightedly dwelt until supper was announced by Joe, and Hugo, leaning upon the arms of Mr. Grattan and Byrnie, followed him into the next room, where a neat, clean table was spread with abundance of wholesome food, and Joe's sunny-faced wife was seated and smiling upon them from the head.</p>
               <p>"Don't make no ceremony, gents," said Joe; "I never did make any apologies, and I ain't going to begin now. We give you a hearty welcome; fall to. Here, Hugo, my fine boy, take this chair. Mary has got a pillow in it, so that it will sit easy for you. There," he said, after he had fixed him comfortably in his seat, "now welcome your friends, my boy, as if you were at home." At these words, so full of honest kindness, tears started to Hugo's eyes, and he turned away his head to hide his emotion, while Grattan and Byrnie sat with lips compressed, as if to prevent a similar exhibition of feeling. Joe bustled about, filling their plates, his big, honest heart full of joy at the evident pleasure he was giving his guests, and checking himself occasionally, to keep down his feelings, while "Susie," as he called his wife, bent her head busily over her tea-things.</p>
               <p>"God bless you, Joe," Hugo at length exclaimed. "I may never be able to repay your kindness to me, but God will reward you in His own way, and in His own good time. If I succeed here, I owe everything to you."</p>
               <p>"Never mind, Hugo," Joe replied. "God smiles upon me now every day, and there is not a heart around my hearthstone that is not filled with sunshine; ought I not to do all the good I can in my little way?"</p>
               <p>"By all the gods, ancient and modern!" Byrnie cried, striking the table violently in his enthusiasm, "here is a prince out of place. Joe Tyson, give me your hand! You are my better, sir, and I bow honestly and humbly before you. Virtue so rare is almost worthy of unqualified worship;" and he bowed profoundly to their honest entertainer, who looked from one to the other as if he did not understand how he had made himself worthy of such praise.</p>
               <p>Grattan also came forward, and grasping Joe's brawny hand, said: "My good friend, your example is worth more than a thousand sermons to us, and if we profit by it, we shall go home wiser and better than we came."</p>
               <p>"Well, my dear gents," Joe replied with simple honesty, "I am extremely happy if I have done you any good; I but spoke what my heart prompted. You are welcome, gents, as well as the boy, to what we can give. Come, sit up."</p>
               <p>They all sat up to the hospitable board again, and reader, we will venture the assertion that happier or better hearts, for the time, were never circled round one table. It was late at night when the little party broke up, and Byrnie and Grattan, in Joe's vehicle, with Joe singing and whistling alternately from the box, returned to their quarters in Broadway, and the two friends talked over the incidents of their visit for nearly the balance of the night.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
               <head type="sub">INTERVIEW IN THE STUDIO—GRATTAN'S SERMON—VISIT TO THE ART UNION—HAPPY REALITIES FOLLOWING GLOOMY IMAGININGS.</head>
               <p>A FEW days after the visit to Joe Tyson's, Grattan had the pleasure of greeting Hugo—who had now only to recruit his lost physical strength to be as well as ever—in his own room. We need not tell how his heart bled at the evidences that surrounded him on every side of the extreme poverty in which Grattan lived. The whole apartment was wretched and cheerless in the extreme. A miserable stone pitcher and a few crusts of bread, on a rude table in one corner, spoke of the scanty meal which had but just been concluded. Grattan himself—hollow-eyed, melancholy, and dispirited—gazing at Hugo, as he looked about him, embarrassed him so much that he could say nothing. His friend, however, as if interpreting his looks, exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"It is so with half the artists—perhaps more—in the city, and you will not be cheered into any very bright anticipations of your future when you visit them in their dens. Some of them treat their situation with levity, some with indifference, and some look upon it in sullen and impotent rage and indignation; and according to the different phases of character, some are dissipated, some are the toadies and pensioners upon so-called patrons of Art, and a large class are misanthropic and disgusted. Few are really happy, except when actively engaged upon their own creations, and the world and its cares and injustice are forgotten."</p>
               <p>"How is it, Mr. Grattan—for Heaven's sake tell me!—that I find you in this terrible situation? Did you not bring money from home with you?"</p>
               <p>"Not much, Hugo. Old Grey (God bless him!) procured a loan for me, but I only reserved enough of this to bring me here. The balance I gave to Kate, to keep her in good spirits, confident that I should eventually do well here; and since my experience has proved to me that this is not likely to be the case, I have no heart to reveal the truth to her, by sending home for money, and I will not flatter and fawn upon any wealthy fool simply to make a living."</p>
               <p>"This is horrible," Hugo replied, looking about the room again—"this is disgraceful. Even that <emph>one</emph> meritorious artist should so live, in the heart of a metropolis which professes to give tone to the taste of the nation, is a burning shame."</p>
               <p>"There are not, Hugo, in the whole city, ten artists whose prosperity is guaged by their real merits, who are living as comfortably, or meet with as much consideration from the struggling mass who surround us, as the most miserable vender of cakes and beer in the filthiest street in the city. Art and its votaries, whatever may be said to the contrary, are overshadowed by the material—the practical."</p>
               <p>"Even a more moderate view of the case, my friend, will make it bad enough—disgraceful enough. Do not let your own wrongs make you unjust, Mr. Grattan."</p>
               <p>"Very well said, Hugo," Grattan replied, with a faint effort at a smile. "I am glad to see you come to the struggle in a hopeful spirit, but you speak from hope alone—I from knowledge and experience."</p>
               <p>"Oh, it can not be so bad here as you represent, Mr. Grattan," Hugo insisted, a shade of melancholy for a moment passing across his face.</p>
               <p>"It is fully as bad, and I believe worse; for every artist who is doing well, or rather who is living with even the comforts of life (there are none doing <emph>well,</emph> except those who have established reputations by merit or otherwise, and forced a respect and consideration which forty others in the city are<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6567-00000137"/> struggling through the various stages of poverty and rags to attain, without the faintest hope of success)—for every artist who is even living above want, there are at least ten who lodge in garrets like this, not knowing where the next meal of victuals is to come from." As he concluded, he pointed to the remnants of his morning meal, lying beside his pitcher of water, and added: "It may not always be so bad with me, Hugo, but I can not for the life of me see that kind of discriminating taste and patronage that promises a fitting reward to the best exertions of the best artists, laying aside entirely any claim which I may have, or fancy I have, personally, upon the public."</p>
               <p>"Is there no remedy, Mr. Grattan, for such intolerable injustice?" Hugo asked, indignantly. "If what you say is true, it is enough to make brigands of all the artists in the country."</p>
               <p>"And so it would," Grattan replied, bitterly; "except that Providence, for some wise purpose, has made them entirely unfit for anything but just that which they cling to so tenaciously, and an artist who attempted to pick pockets or steal, as a mode of obtaining a living, would bungle the matter, and be sure to be detected. Remedy!" he exclaimed, in reply to Hugo's question; "certainly, there <emph>is</emph> a remedy, but it strikes at the very root of the prevailing practical notions of our society, and it would be utterly useless to attempt to produce any effect upon these notions. My views, Hugo, would do no manner of good to you or any one else."</p>
               <p>"Still, I should like to hear them, Mr. Grattan; you don't know how much good you may do <emph>me,</emph> at any rate, for if prospects are so terribly depressing, I shall, for one, unconditionally give up such a beggarly profession. Let <emph>me</emph> at least, have the benefit of your experience. If I had any idea or plan which would prove available in such a terrible state of things, I would promulgate it fearlessly at the street corners."</p>
               <p>"Yes, Grattan," cried Byrnie, who broke in upon them at this juncture; "let the bile off, my dear friend, it may do <emph>you</emph> good, too."</p>
               <p>"I am not afraid to express my views anywhere, and I think you both know that I never use honeyed words to express myself, upon any subject in which I am interested. Now, if you are prepared to hear what I have to say, and will not reproach me for bitterness, I will tell you what I think is necessary to be done to ameliorate the condition of the Artist and the Arts, but I shall call things by their right names."</p>
               <p>"Proceed, Mr. Grattan, you will oblige us much," Byrnie exclaimed; "it is not too late to save two of us, at least."</p>
               <p>Hugo looked curiously at Byrnie, not having yet become acquainted with him sufficiently to understand what a queer compound of contradictory elements he was, while Mr. Grattan continued:</p>
               <p>"Well, my friends, you shall be gratified; and you, Byrnie, at least, will be obliged to indorse my sentiments. If I were going to preach upon this subject I would select no magnificent church from the pulpit of which to deliver my discourses, to be listened to only by those whose money enables them to support the appearance of piety, which the poor must forego; but I would go first to the counting-room of the merchant, and I would whisper in his ear, 'You are killing yourself, sir, by inches; you will not have pure blood enough to animate your emaciated carcass another year; your insane struggles to amass wealth, which you can never live to enjoy, and your neglect to cultivate those influences which alone afford a substantial enjoyment, have already turned your heart to stone, and dried up all those channels of happiness which you should have kept pure and uncontaminated. Leave your desk; call together the men of your profession; tell them your sad experience; tell them how you started in life with pure, fresh feelings and impulses, only desirous to do the greatest amount of good to the whole number; tell them how the iron law of traffic gradually deadened these feelings, which were followed by grasping, heartless penuriousness; tell them how the warm feelings of your youth were gradually petrified,<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC6567-00000138"/> and by what process you became what you are. Then tell them that there <emph>is,</emph> there <emph>must be,</emph> a God (there are few of them who believe this, Hugo, however much they may pray and attend church); that this God, who implanted in their natures those yearnings for the good and the beautiful, who implanted in their hearts love, charity—has had nothing to do with the baser passions which have driven them forth from them. This has been <emph>man's</emph> work. God never intended that the sole aim of life should be to make money, or He would have created all men with the ability to succeed in doing so. He did not create one man with the talent and organization of the artist, another with those of the poet, another those of the merchant, another those of the philosopher, without at the same time intending that each should have full scope for these varied powers; and He has given every man sufficient appreciation, if he could be made to believe it, to enjoy the labors of each, and contribute to the happiness of all.' Then, addressing them, it might be added: 'You, miserable creatures, professing to believe in and obey this great and good God, have gone to work in your worldly wisdom to improve upon His work. In the place of true religion, you have set up Mammon; in the place of poetry and painting, you have set up Mammon; in the place of all that is elevating or ennobling, you have set up Mammon, and Mammon has blinded you to all those influences which, had you used them as you passed through life, would have made your journey happier and pleasanter; pause where you are! look about you upon the suffering thousands, more worthy and deserving than yourself, a thousand-fold. Open your heart once more to the purer feelings of your youth; erase the stereotyped impression of the day-book and ledger from your heart, and suffer some bright picture which has emanated from the brain of some half-starved artist in some attic or cellar of your city, to take for a moment their place. Purchase of such pictures as your means will allow, and surround yourself with these and the like influences, and you will soon discover that the great God did not create men expressly to spend their money at your counter, or derive their chief happiness from your smiles.'"</p>
               <p>"This is horrible," Hugo exclaimed.</p>
               <p>"Let him go," Byrnie cried out, at the same time laughing heartily; "let him go, young man. He will feel much better when this is all over. Pitch in, Grattan!"</p>
               <p>"Stop a moment, Byrnie; I am not yet done."</p>
               <p>"Well, my friend, go ahead. I will listen with as much gravity and decorum as any of your congregation could do if you were a preacher. What further would you say to this hard world?"</p>
               <p>"I would say to every honest, earnest man, in whatever position, stand up! before God you are a better and worthier man than he whose gilded coach and palatial mansion you so much envy. Look up! there are higher and purer fountains of happiness, which your honest industry better fits you to enjoy, and from which you can drink to your heart's content; when the brainless nabob, whom you so much envy, sinking beneath disease, generated by vice and dissipation, totters into his gilded sepulcher, to be forgotten before another year."</p>
               <p>"But what would you say," Byrnie asked—"what would you say to the man who should answer you that you are crazy—that you are wild—that this is a brain-picture—that there is no truth in it?"</p>
               <p>"I would tell him," said Grattan, his eyes flashing with excitement, "I would tell him to throw away his ill-gotten wealth, and begin the world over again; to try to earn his bread honestly; try the profession of the artist, the literary man, the musician—the preacher, even; try either of these for one year, and at the end of that time return to me, and if his opinion is the same as it is now, I will admit that I have exaggerated; this is what I would say to him, Mr. Byrnie."</p>
               <p>"And I think he would be puzzled to reply," said Byrnie; "but I am sorry, Grattan, to interrupt your sermon, and bring you back to the real—the practical—by giving you no<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6567-00000139"/> very pleasant information: I have just returned from the Art Union."</p>
               <p>"Well!" Grattan asked, in great excitement, "what news?"</p>
               <p>"Neither of our pictures are sold, or likely to be," Byrnie answered, despondingly.</p>
               <p>"Were they objected to on the score of demerits?" Grattan asked.</p>
               <p>"No!" Byrnie answered. The gentlemanly secretary informed me that the committee, at their last meeting, had determined to postpone indefinitely any further purchases. He says that they were involved for advanced commissions more than their present receipts, and that the newspaper war which has commenced upon them, coupled with the moral sensibilities that have been shocked by the lottery feature of the enterprise, will probably seriously cripple them for at least one year, and perhaps forever."</p>
               <p>"In short," said Grattan, completely prostrated by this blow, "the last ray of hope has gone, and we have but the choice between suicide and beggary. Oh, law! oh, justice! you are wondrous far-reaching, and filled with wisdom. Oh, morality! your nerves are wondrous sensitive; you hurl your mutual shafts at an institution which, however had may be its management, still has for its object the promotion of influences which would shed a permanent luster upon our national character, and the abuses of which it is abundantly in the power of the wise lawgivers who created it to reform. Oh, most sensitive morality! you war upon such an institution as this, and shut your eyes to crimes in and out of church, which should make your cheeks crimson with shame. I am heartily sick, Byrnie, of all this mock morality which permits an honest poor man to contend against hope, without sympathy, and kisses the dust off the feet of a gilded rascal!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, trumpery! oh, Moses!" Byrnie chimed in; "now, Hugo, did anybody ever hear such a pointed sermon with such a palpable moral, which says plainly enough, 'the times are bad, but the people are badder!' ha! ha! ha! Why, Grattan, what the deuce is the use of making things worse by fretting about them? We are doomed to starve, and let's meet our fate like men. A glass of good brandy would let in upon your darkened soul lots of sunshine. Come, try it now; it's better than sermons or sermonizing for all the ills of life."</p>
               <p>"Byrnie, I am surprised at your levity," Grattan exclaimed, irritated at what he considered ill-timed humor. "You are yourself a sufferer from the very difficulties I lament, and I can not comprehend your indifference."</p>
               <p>"If you will show me the man, Grattan, who ever got fat or made money by grumbling, I'll turn in and grumble till my head aches. You might as well try to drink the Atlantic dry, as to spend your breath upon popular vices and follies, as well as rascalities, which are hugged to the heart with so much affection."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Grattan," Hugo interposed, "Mr. Byrnie is right. <emph>I</emph> know you well. You are prone to anticipate the worst before the worst is realized."</p>
               <p>"I acknowledge, Hugo, that there is truth in what you say. It may be unfortunate that my experiences have made me somewhat bitter and misanthropic. Still, you can not deny the truth of my position. We are artists by nature, not from any choice of our own, and it is as reasonable to suppose that <emph>our</emph> talent was given for as good a purpose, and is as worthy of encouragement, as the talent of any man in any other profession or employment. Yet it is a plain fact, that the world does not so look upon it."</p>
               <p>"All right, Grattan," Byrnie broke in again, with another merry laugh; "But if the world acts ugly, show your teeth and growl. There is nothing to be made by fancying one's self a martyr, and grumbling about it. I am as rich as John Jacob Astor as long as I have a five-cent piece in my pocket to purchase oblivion."</p>
               <p>"Oh! Byrnie," said Grattan, "this purchasing oblivion may be as ruinous as my grumbling, and much more so. You acknowledge the truth of all that I claim by this very declaration."</p>
               <pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6567-00000140"/>
               <p>"True, Mr. Grattan!" Hugo exclaimed, with feeling, "but I believe you are both wrong; at any rate I shall still hope, for my part, and neither grumble nor adopt Mr. Byrnie's plan."</p>
               <p>"Hope on, Hugo! hope on!" Grattan replied; "your experiences will soon teach you that you will need all that you have. You are not upon the threshold yet; farther on, hope will die."</p>
               <p>"Never!" cried Hugo, emphatically; "I know I have not so many causes to make me despair as you have, Mr. Grattan, but I believe that we shall both see better times, and this hope is worth cherishing if it never is to be realized. We still have the prospect of private patronage to encourage us."</p>
               <p>"You talk like a man, Hugo!" Byrnie exclaimed, enthusiastically, "and Grattan ought to take courage from your example. We ought both to be ashamed of ourselves," he added, seriously.</p>
               <p>"Private patronage!" Grattan cried, contemptuously; "that has been tried effectually. If there was any reliable private taste, this might do; but there is none, or not enough to be of any benefit to Art in the widest sense, and until taste is formed and educated, to found hope upon such a basis is folly. A very few lucky artists monopolize all there is of private patronage. The hope of a sale of our pictures to the Art Union, you say, is, for the time, gone; where, then, is the discriminating <emph>private</emph> patron who is likely to single either of us three out as worthy of his assistance and encouragement? There may be two or three who would do so, if they should make our acquaintance, which is decidedly unlikely. The rest are as likely, more likely, indeed, to patronize your Adolphus Rembrandt Tucker, than a <emph>real</emph> artist, because such men do not exhibit anything above their comprehension, which goes no further than gaudy colors and clap-trap."</p>
               <p>"It is all very bad," Byrnie answered, "but not so bad as to shut out <emph>all</emph> hope. I have the promise from the secretary of the Union that especial exertions will be made to find private purchasers for our pictures."</p>
               <p>"Then <emph>he</emph> was pleased with them?" Grattan asked, evidently relieved; "he thought there was something in them?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly," said Byrnie; "he spoke of yours, particularly, and said if it were not for the reasons he named to me, the picture would not be left unpurchased one moment."</p>
               <p>"Did he say this?" said Grattan, a gleam of joy lighting his eye; "if he was honest in such an expression, then there <emph>is</emph> still hope."</p>
               <p>"Well," said Byrnie, with a merry laugh, "who the deuce cares whether he was honest or not; he seemed so, and that is all we care for. The poet hath it—'Sadness only grows fat with what she feeds upon,' and I am not going, for my part, to furnish her with any more human diet. Are you, my young friend?"</p>
               <p>"No!" Hugo replied, "I am not! It would be better, far, to spend the last cent one had in his purse, in what the world would call idle or foolish enjoyments, than to indulge such terribly depressing reflections."</p>
               <p>"An excellent suggestion, my boy," Byrnie exclaimed, "and we will all leave this blue atmosphere, and go out and see what the world is doing. If we can not do better, we will unite our purses, invest the sum total in a glass of grog, each one imbibe his moiety, and if it don't make us drunk or oblivious, it will go somewhat towards it, perhaps. Don't take the dumps, Grattan. If we can't succeed at this profession, there are several honorable ones yet open to us in which we may succeed. We can turn pick-pockets, thimble-riggers, politicians, run for mayor or alderman, or some such dodge as that. Blast me, if I don't turn fire-eater, and swallow swords a yard long, before an audience of gaping country-bumpkins, before <emph>I'll</emph> give up the ship! Come, Grattan, kick the blues to the dogs! Let's go out."</p>
               <p>Grattan was pleased with the proposition, and the three left the room and started, they knew not where. In passing Brown's door they called for him, and insisted that he should join them. He came forth, with a melancholy smile upon his<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC6567-00000141"/> face, and tried to excuse himself, but no excuse would answer, and he was forced to make one of the party.</p>
               <p>When they stepped out upon the street, Grattan took Brown's arm and led off, and Hugo and Byrnie followed.</p>
               <p>"Grattan," Hugo called out, "suppose we make it a part of our business to hunt up a room for me; I am anxious to be at work."</p>
               <p>"Well, so be it," said Grattan; "but I thought you would probably remain at Joe Tyson's, you seemed so well pleased with each other."</p>
               <p>"I shall continue to take my meals there," Hugo answered, "if I can make enough to pay for them. Joe, the noble hearted fellow, would not listen to anything short of this, and even wanted to rent and furnish a room in the same building, as a studio for me. I could not consent to this, and excused myself upon the plea that I wished to get a room somewhere nearer the public galleries."</p>
               <p>"That Joe is a noble fellow," said Byrnie; "there is many a purse-proud nabob in the city who sports his carriage, his servants in livery, his elegant furniture and pictures, who is not a thousandth part as worthy of these blessings, or so capable to appreciate them, as this same Joe Tyson."</p>
               <p>"That is no doubt true," Hugo answered; "but Joe has one of those happy temperaments that, so long as he earns enough to keep his little family comfortable, he will never be unhappy."</p>
               <p>"Pray God the time may never come when he can not do that," said Byrnie. "But there's Brown and Grattan stopped in front of the Art Union. What's the matter?" he asked, as they joined the others.</p>
               <p>"We stopped to see whether you and Hugo would not like to go in; he has never been in any of the galleries."</p>
               <p>Hugo was delighted with the proposition, and they all entered the long hall which led through the building, and opened into the gallery, and soon found themselves, with a crowd of other visitors, sauntering about the room, examining and criticising. Hugo's enthusiastic delight knew no bounds, as he, for the first time in his life, found himself surrounded by the works of our most eminent painters about whom he had read and dreamed so much, and his elder companions smiled at the joyous exclamations which burst from him at every turn.</p>
               <p>"Where is your picture, Mr. Grattan?" he asked, "and yours, Mr. Byrnie? I want to see <emph>them.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Oh, here they hang, over here," Byrnie answered, leading the way to another part of the room; "but I wanted to get your opinion of them, Hugo, before you knew whose they were."</p>
               <p>The two crossed the room, and were approaching the point where these pictures were hanging, when they were stopped by a pleasant, warm-hearted-looking gentleman, with a pair of speaking black eyes in his head, who shook hands with Byrnie familiarly, and was by him introduced to Hugo as Mr. Warden, the corresponding secretary of the Art Union. He joined them in their walk, and Hugo was immediately interested in him, and from the many inquiries he made of Hugo, the feeling seemed to be mutual At length Byrnie said to Hugo, "These are our pictures—there, those two: what do you think of them?"</p>
               <p>"They are beautiful, indeed," said Hugo, after a moment's pause, and coloring to the eyes, for he had caught sight of his own recently-finished picture (which he had sent to Mason &amp; Carter's a few days before) hanging just beside them; and so great was his confusion at this unexpected occurrence, that he could hardly answer the questions which were showered upon him by Byrnie. To make the matter worse, Byrnie, whose eye had also caught Hugo's little picture, turned to Mr. Warden, and said:</p>
               <p>"Why, Mr. Warden, here is a beautiful little thing that has come in since my last visit—whose is that?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Warden, "that is an excellent little picture, but I don't know who painted it. Mr. Mason brought it in yesterday, I think, and said that it was the work of quite a young artist, recently arrived in the city, and whom he wished very much to aid."</p>
               <pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC6567-00000142"/>
               <p>"Well, I declare!" cried Byrine, while Hugo's face glowed like a furnace, "whoever he may be, he will make a noise in the world; that picture, Mr. Warden, bears the unmistakable stamp of genius."</p>
               <p>"Yes," the other replied, "of a high order. I was amused," said Mr. Warden, "at the account Mr. Mason gave me of the deception he practiced upon some of our connoisseurs a few days ago, with a group of dogs—I think he said, painted by the same young man."</p>
               <p>At this remark, Byrnie turned full upon Hugo, and, to Mr. Warden's surprise, grasped both the hands of the youth, who was almost overcome by confusion and embarrassment, and exclaimed, while he shook them almost off his arms—</p>
               <p>"Hugo, my fine fellow, your fortune is made! Mr. Warden," he continued, turning to him, "this is the author of both those works, and I can testify to the truth of Mr. Mason's story of the dogs, for I was a witness to that scene myself."</p>
               <p>Mr. Warden shook Hugo warmly by the hand, congratulated him upon the progress he had made, and asked him if he intended to stop long in the city.</p>
               <p>Hugo answered modestly that they were even then looking about for a room, as he intended to stop in the city some time, and perhaps permanently.</p>
               <p>"If that is the case," Mr. Warden replied, "you need go no farther. There is a very good room in the front of this building, on the third floor, which, if not too high up, will answer your purpose well. It has just been vacated by Baldwin, one of our artists, who is going for a few months west."</p>
               <p>"I am afraid of only two things," said Hugo, blushing. "The room will be too expensive and too public for me at present. Something cheaper and more retired will answer me quite as well."</p>
               <p>"The expense will not be much, and as to its location, you could not find one more favorable. Your merits, young man," he added, putting Hugo on the shoulder, "will attract attention tion, and you will have no occasion to avoid observation, even for the present."</p>
               <p>"Look here, Grattan!" Byrnie called out, interrupting Warden, as Grattan and Brown approached them from another part of the gallery—"look here! here is Hugo's 'invalid picture.' Is it not beautiful?" And while Grattan, with a generous pride in Hugo, was admiring the picture and wondering how it came there, Byrnie was telling all that had transpired, and concluded by asking if he did not think it the best thing Hugo could do to take the room offered him in the building.</p>
               <p>There was but one opinion upon this subject, and Hugo, scarce knowing what he did or said, so completely was he unhinged by what had occurred, consented to the arrangement. As they were leaving the gallery, Mr. Warden remarked to Hugo that his picture was probably sold at private sale, as well as those of Grattan and Byrnie, and hoped that a liberal patronage, equal to their merits, would soon place them all in pleasant circumstances.</p>
               <p>The reader may well imagine that Hugo was not slow in conveying this news to Byrnie and Grattan, who had just gone out.</p>
               <p>Byrnie jumped about when he heard it, and rubbed his hands in glee. "There, Grattan," said he, "talk about discriminating private patronage now! Here, already, some gentlemen of known taste, and liberal patrons of the arts, have purchased, from three of our most distinguished artists, pictures which have been on exhibition only about forty-eight hours. Think better of it, Grattan. By George! I'll get drunk certain, if half this news proves true."</p>
               <p>Grattan received all this in silence. He felt as much inward joy, perhaps, as the other, but he had not the same easy, cheerful temperament, and, as a consequence, did not shut his eyes to reality. As for Hugo, he walked along with happy countenance and elastic step, bright dreams of future triumphs meantime floating through his mind, and rendering him oblivious of the present.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXV.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE DOG STORY GETS INTO THE NEWSPAPERS—BYRNIE'S JUBILATIONS—THE YOUNG ARTIST'S PROSPECTS—FURTHER INKLINGS OF MYSTERIES—HOPE-GLEAMS FOR GRATTAN.</head>
               <p>"THERE, Hugo," said Byrnie, as they got into the street, "you may write me down a fool, if what I say does not prove true; your fortune is made, as sure as you are born. That dog story, if it has not already got into the city papers, will soon get into them, and you will become a lion. A little humbug, of which you are entirely innocent, will give you more patronage than you would have ever secured in any other way. How anxious these 'upper-ten' asses will be to secure a picture from the wonderful young artist who has fooled some of our most enlightened critics into the belief that one of his pictures was a genuine Landseer!" And at the end of this sage speech, which was delivered with most expressive emphasis and comical grimace, the whole party broke into a fit of uproarious laughter, Grattan himself not excepted.</p>
               <p>Hugo Blanc, who was the occasion for all this wit, humor, and sarcasm, could scarcely understand the half of it, and walked on without saying anything, but with a face flushed with excitement and joy. In the moment of this first triumph his thoughts flew homeward, and in imagination he saw there the family grouped around the hearthstone, reading the startling announcement, that the outcast son had in little more than three weeks achieved a position which would have made older artists carry their heads high. He visited in imagination the cottage of Mrs. Grattan, and witnessed the smile of joy that lit up the gentle face of the mother, and noted the crystal drops in the eye of Mary, as she read to her the announcement, that Hugo was already acknowledged as an artist of promise even in New York.</p>
               <p>His further reflections were cut off by Byrnie, who said to Grattan, as they were passing a large eating-saloon: "Grattan, let us step in here a moment. I am anxious to look at the city papers, and see if we don't find some mention of this matter. I am full of it; ain't it rich?" And as they entered the establishment, he burst again into immoderate fits of laughter.</p>
               <p>The whole party followed him back into an adjoining reading-room, which had several tables containing files of both city and country papers; while Byrnie was hunting over these, Grattan called Hugo to one side of the room, and drew his attention to a fine landscape which adorned the wall.</p>
               <p>"That," he said, "is one of Kensett's pictures, of whom you have heard me speak so much; and while all New York is agog with the wonders and glories of the Dusseldorf collection, here is one of her own citizens who is not half appreciated; whose slightest effort has more real merit in it than the whole collection, spears of grass, shoe-buckles, pebble-stones, and all."</p>
               <p>"I have not seen the Dusseldorf pictures," Hugo replied; "but this is certainly a masterpiece."</p>
               <p>"I intended to have shown you some of his studies from nature in the Art Union," Grattan continued, "but I forgot it in the excitement attending your little triumph; but we will see them some other time."</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha! ha!" roared Byrnie, at this juncture; "come here—here we have it! I knew it! I felt it in my bones! this is perfectly rich! Sit down," he said, as they all huddled around him; and after they were seated, he took a seat himself, and, by way of prelude, took another hearty laugh. "Now," he said, clearing his throat, "listen. I read from the <title>New World;</title> here we have it!</p>
               <pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6567-00000144"/>
               <p>"'Excitement in the Art World—a Prodigy!'" Having gone thus far, he looked over the top of the paper at Hugo—who now wished himself anywhere else—with such a droll expression, that to laugh was inevitable, and it was some time before he could go on himself.</p>
               <p>"'Excitement is the Art World!'" he at length repeated, reading the heading, and concluded, drawing out the words, "a p-r-o-d-i-g-y."</p>
               <p>"Well, well; Byrnie, go on; don't keep us in suspense," Grattan urged.</p>
               <p>"Now listen, then!" Byrnie proceeded— <q>
                     <p>"'We have been informed that an amusing and surprising circumstance occurred a few days since at the well-known establishment of Mason &amp; Carter, Broadway. It seems that a picture had been sent there for sale by a young artist, recently arrived in the city, and who was hurt some days ago on the landing. This picture was a group of dogs, admirably executed. We are further informed that a landscape of remarkable promise, from the same hand, is on exhibition at the Art Union, which, if not already purchased by that institution, should at once be secured by some of our wealthy connoisseurs, as we have no doubt the young man is destined to attain an enviable distinction as an artist.</p>
                     <p>"'Some of our would-be-supposed critics were loudly praising it, and contending among themselves whether it was an original Landseer or only a copy by some masterly hand, and negotiating for its purchase at a large price, when the work was recognized by a friend of the artist, who, very injudiciously for the owner, announced the fact that it was a boy's work. A picture of the group at that moment would be rich. The picture at once depreciated in value, and although <emph>it</emph> was not sold, some of the party felt that <emph>they</emph> were most decidedly."</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"There!" said Byrnie, throwing himself back in his chair, and speaking to Hugo; "if you ain't ticketed through, then I confess I am no prophet."</p>
               <p>Congratulations were showered upon Hugo, and his pleasure at what he heard was much enhanced by the knowledge that it came from those who really felt joy at his success. He was too much confused and abashed, however, to say anything in reply to the remarks of his friends, and sat, after Byrnie had finished reading, like one in a dream.</p>
               <p>Brown, who had been more quiet than the rest, and who, indeed, seldom said much, here came forward, and said to Hugo: "I have lived in this city many years, my young friend, and have struggled against the most depressing circumstances. I know all about the Art world of New York. If my opinion is worth anything, these circumstances, trifling as they may seem to you, have placed you in the very middle of a current which will carry you on to fame, if not to fortune. You will be the toast; and although I am happy to say that you deserve it, yet, whether you did or not, it would make no difference in the result."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I'll bet the coat off my back," said Byrnie, "that he has a commission from old Grabb before the week is out. He comes at the call of the trumpet more promptly than any poodle among them. All upper-tendom will be in a fever of excitement. But, however farcical it may appear, I must confess that I am heartily rejoiced. Let's go home," he added, and settle the programme for a 'big drunk,' in honor of the undoubted success of our young friend. I can't do justice to the subject myself unless I am, at least, 'three sheets in the wind.'"</p>
               <p>At this suggestion the party sallied out again, and returned to Grattan's room, where, after agreeing to go in a body to the Art Union the next afternoon, Brown and Byrnie left Grattan and Hugo to talk over matters of private interest, and sought their own rooms.</p>
               <p>Once entirely by themselves, the latter two talked long and earnestly over all the incidents of their past and present experiences. Hugo spoke to his friend of many things which had not been mentioned in their former conversation at Joe Tyson's, including a full statement of all the trials and struggles with himself which preceded his final determination to cave home, and, notwithstanding all opposition, test his powers as an artist, and learn for himself the strength of his resources. "And now, Mr. Grattan," he concluded, "I am here, not only with my hopes strong within me, but feeling it also a duty to do all in my power to impart some of these hopes to you."</p>
               <pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC6567-00000145"/>
               <p>Mr. Grattan shook his head, as if in doubt whether Hugo's anticipations would not be sadly disappointed, thanked him kindly for his noble intentions in regard to himself, and in return for his confidence, gave him a full account of all his own troubles and trials since he had come to the city, and among other things told him of his first meeting, and the many subsequent interviews he had had, with Granny Stiles and the strange conduct of the woman, and finally, that at his last interview he had read a letter in her possession, purporting to come from Sharkey, written within the past two weeks, and post-marked "Coldwell," in which it was stated that inquiries would be made in a short time, by some one whose name was not given, for himself. This story involved a history of Mr. Grattan's past life, containing many facts with which Hugo had been hitherto unacquainted; and among other things, an account of the shipwreck and death of his poor mother, and the terrible life he led in his youth, while yet under the control of Granny Stiles, and his final release from this thralldom by running away from her, and all his after-experiences in his struggles to acquire a knowledge of Art. "And now, Hugo," Grattan continued, drawing nearer to his excited listener, and speaking in a low voice, "I must tell you of a circumstance which will make your young blood curdle in your veins, but the confession will relieve my mind of a weight which I can no longer endure. This, however," he added, laying his hand upon Hugo's arm, and looking at him steadily, "must not be told until you promise me that my secret shall be safe in your keeping, until I myself choose to take a step that I have long meditated, to clear my conscience of a load of self-accusation and guilt; which has caused much of the misery which you have seen so often oppress and unman me."</p>
               <p>Hugo listened to him with mingled feelings of astonishment and terror as he delivered this sentence, and for a moment that terrible suspicion which had so often before occurred to him, suddenly flashed upon his mind, and deprived him of the power to speak. And while he paused to debate with himself what he should say or how act, Mr. Grattan sat looking at him keenly, as if trying to read what was passing in his mind, and after a moment thus occupied, broke silence again by asking—</p>
               <p>"Will you promise, Hugo, that my secret shall be safe with you until the time I name?"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Grattan," Hugo answered abstractedly, and in a scarcely audible voice, for his mind still fixed itself upon many mysterious circumstances in the past which had often come unbidden to his mind, "Mr. Grattan, I will not violate your confidence—you can trust me implicitly."</p>
               <p>Mr. Grattan, thus assured, went on with the narrative which this conversation had interrupted, and, in low but deeply excited tones, told Hugo all about his conversation with Sharkey in his office at Coldwell, the circumstances that led to it, and the encounter afterward in the woods, and its result; and paused with fearful interest upon the mental suffering which he had ever since endured, although he could not, in his more sober and rational moments, believe himself guilty of murder, as he had only acted in self-defense. He then imparted to Hugo full particulars of the mysterious disappearance of Sharkey's body, and the after-interview with, and strange conduct of, old Grey.</p>
               <p>At this part of Grattan's story, Hugo stared at him with lips apart, and a nervous excitement which he could not conceal. His thoughts ran back to the night he left home, and the mysterious occurrences at old Grey's on that occasion immediately connected themselves in his mind, with his strange and unaccountable anxiety to have Mr. Grattan leave home, with the unexplained secret of Grattan's birth, with the interview with Granny Stiles, and the letter purporting to come from Sharkey, and he felt convinced that all these circumstances were in some way connected, and would probably soon explain themselves. While he sat gazing at Grattan, turning these things in his mind, the latter placed his hand upon his shoulder, and asked, as if in conclusion of his story—</p>
               <p>"Now, Hugo, what am I to think of all this, and particularly<pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6567-00000146"/> larly of this letter, which purports to come from a man whom I had such good reasons to believe was dead?"</p>
               <p>When Grattan asked Hugo this question, he sprang to his feet, and seizing him by the hand, exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"Mr. Grattan, I am in a maze of mysteries! I can not tell you why, but some circumstances that would not have been thought of but from what you have told me, which came to my knowledge in such a way that I am bound in honor to keep them, at least for the present, convince me that Sharkey is really alive—how sayed, Heaven only knows. I am satisfied," he added, after a little thought, "that he is not dead, and that some mystery hangs by all this which will throw light upon that portion of your early life which you tell me is enveloped in darkness."</p>
               <p>As Hugo proceeded, Grattan had bowed his head forward until it had rested upon his knees, and when he concluded he was weeping like a child, and making no effort to stay the tide of pent-up feelings which, once breaking over the bounds that had so long confined them, now completely overcame him. Hugo looked at this struggle, and as he saw his beloved friend thus overcome by this new-found hope, and thought of the terrible secret he had just confided to him, much of his gloomy depression and melancholy was explained, which had many times heretofore seemed unaccountable.</p>
               <p>Grattan, now that he had for the first time since that fatal night mentioned these occurrences to any one except his wife, was terribly moved, and the mysterious letter in the hands of Granny Stiles, the no less mysterious confirmation of that letter in Hugo's story, raised such a conflict in his breast between grief, joy, doubt, and apprehension, that the struggle completely overpowered him. Hugo, fearing that some one might interrupt them, carefully locked the door, and, returning to Mr. Grattan, bent over him with tearful eyes and with affectionate demonstrations of interest, endeavored to cheer and comfort him with the assurances and convictions that all would yet be well, and that his past trials and sorrows would yet be compensated by years of happiness and ease.</p>
               <p>"Ah, Hugo!" Grattan at length answered, "if I could only be convinced that my hand has not struck down a fellow-creature in the prime of manhood, the rest, however hard to endure, I could struggle against. The injustice of man everywhere manifested—turning to gall and bitterness thousands upon thousands of happy hearts and worthy aspirations—this I could still fight against with some little show of resolution, however hopeless the contest. But when to this was coupled the reflection that the sin of murder stained my soul, I tell you candidly I have many times thought that my only relief from this torment was in self-destruction. And now that the hope that I am not guilty of this sin, coming upon me so strangely, begets fear that these hopes may be delusive, and that, hanging by some projecting rock over the yawning gulf of despair, about to drag myself up to a point of safety, this hope, this rock to which I am clinging with my whole being, loosened by my struggles, may give way and carry me with it back into the abyss from which I have hoped to escape—this makes me wild, Hugo—almost mad."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Grattan," said Hugo, encouragingly, and taking up his figure, "cling fast to the rock; swing yourself confidently to the top; it will not give way. The more I think of it, the more I am convinced that you will not have this trouble long to weigh you down. You are not a murderer, Mr. Grattan! Sharkey lives—you may depend!"</p>
               <p>"Hold a moment!" Grattan cried, suddenly starting to his feet wildly, and hurrying to his little trunk; "this may explain a sentence in one of Kate's letters to me, in answer to one in which I divulged this matter to her, and which at the time puzzled me;" and opening the trunk, he hunted among a bundle of letters, and at last, taking one out, he returned to his seat, and opening it, read from it to Hugo the following sentence:</p>
               <p>"My dear husband—do not let this terrible event crush you so entirely to the earth. Sharkey may yet be alive. Grey's conduct is full of mystery. Would it not be strange if he knew more about this matter than, for some reasons, he<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC6567-00000147"/> has chosen to reveal? At any rate, with the worst view you can put upon it, my dear husband, you are no murderer; you acted in self-defense only; and however unfortunate that you did not reveal the whole matter for investigation at the time, Grey will at any time testify to your innocence of the charge of murder. His very conduct, when we look at it, would indicate that there was some mystery about the matter in which he is deeply interested."</p>
               <p>"My God!" Grattan wildly remarked, as he concluded this: "there is some foundation for hope. Even Kate, I suspect, knows more than she reveals, and yet this passage has been entirely unintelligible to me heretofore. I have written to her several times since to tell me what she meant, and her answers have either been evasive, or have rendered the matter more ambiguous."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Grattan," said Hugo, joyfully, "this letter has converted my hopes into certainties; and I would advise you, if nothing occurs soon to confirm them, to return to Coldwell, and have the whole affair thoroughly investigated, your mind relieved, and innocence established."</p>
               <p>"I am only astonished that I have not done so long ago, Hugo, and but for the strange conduct of Grey, which, under the excitement, I did not undertake to analyze, I should have done so at the time."</p>
               <p>"Well, Mr. Grattan, until you conclude to take some steps in this matter yourself, or until this strange problem is solved by those who are from some cause interested in you, as it would appear from the letter to Granny Stiles, make yourself as comfortable as circumstances will allow; and to this end I propose to you that you join me in the rent of the room in the Art-Union building, and we will remove there to-morrow. This horrible place," he added, looking around him, "only aggravates your despondency, and there I shall be constantly with you to cheer you, and you may depend, Mr. Grattan, to me it will be a labor of love."</p>
               <p>"So it shall be, then, Hugo," Grattan warmly replied; "so it shall be. I shall not be happy while filled with so many doubts; but I will endeavor to be a little more cheerful, at the same time that I cling to the hopes that our conversation has engendered. Call to-morrow, about ten in the morning, and, in the mean time, I will have arranged with old Muggs, my landlord, about leaving this room."</p>
               <p>"Good-bye, then, Mr. Grattan, until to-morrow," said Hugo, full of happiness at this arrangement; and taking a warm and affectionate leave of his friend, who was now happier than he had been for years, he wended his way to the kind friends who awaited him at honest Joe Tyson's.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head>
               <head type="sub">REFLECTIONS—A STREET RAMBLE—AN UNEXPECTED ARRIVAL</head>
               <p>THE busy hum of the great city waking from slumber had filled the air for hours, and the windows of the room where Grattan slept had vibrated and rattled from the heavy weight of omnibuses and carriages which thronged to and fro in their accustomed channel, Broadway, since the early dawn, and still he slept upon his accustomed couch (the floor), and his slumber was more deep and refreshing than any he had known for months. Truth to say, Mr. Grattan had lain down, after writing a letter to his wife and daughter, in better spirits and brighter hopes than it was his wont to indulge; and when he at length opened his eyes, and saw how far into the day his slumbers had carried him, he started up and commenced shaking the dust and dirt from his cloak, without any of his usual melancholy obtruding upon this labor. After a scanty breakfast from the little leaf which lay wrapped in a piece of paper beside the pitcher of water in the corner, and after taking a look at the picture upon his easel, which he hoped to make better than the one on exhibition in the Art Union, he descended the stairs and entered the establishment of Muggs, Brass &amp; Muggs, to inform the senior Muggs, who was the owner of the building, that he was about to leave the room he occupied, and could not at present pay all his rent. I shall not stop to tell the reader how insultingly pompous the wealthy landlord was to the poverty-stricken and helpless artist, nor what unjust aspersions he was obliged to listen to. Suffice it to say, that by paying the infamous little villain the ten dollars so kindly advanced by Hugo, and leaving his cloak and trunk in pawn for the balance, he was permitted to take his body where he pleased. At any other time such an outrage would have nearly killed our worthy friend, but the conversation of the evening before had filled him with hope, and Mr. Grattan submitted, without any exhibition of anger or mortification, to the scandalous exactions of the wealthy Muggs, and even brought his trunk and cloak, and delivered them to him with his own hands.</p>
               <p>When Hugo arrived, he had everything else that he proposed to remove packed and ready, and Byrnie was pacing up and down the room, swearing and cursing like a trooper at the meanness of Muggs; while Grattan, contrary to his usual custom, was laughing heartily at this display of honest indignation. Hugo, once made acquainted with the outrage to which Grattan had been subjected, was almost as furious as Byrnie; but as neither could afford any pecuniary aid, there was no alternative except to leave the trunk and cloak in the hands of Muggs until fortune should smile again, and remove what he had left (which was done forthwith) to his new room.</p>
               <p>Here Grattan and Hugo were joined by Mr. Warden, who told them that a small bedroom adjoining had usually rented with this room, and if they chose they could occupy that also. But the best part of his information was, that Hugo's picture and Grattan's were both sold, and Byrnie's would probably be taken the next day. He told them, with many kind wishes for their success, that they could draw on him for the amount paid on the pictures whenever they chose. He had stipulated with the purchasers that the pictures should remain some time in the gallery on exhibition, as a favorable means of bringing them into notice; and after making some kind suggestions as to the mode of furnishing their rooms economically and comfortably, and recommending them to a furniture-dealer who would furnish what they needed at reasonable prices, he withdrew.</p>
               <pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6567-00000149"/>
               <p>Grattan went out immediately, purchased the furniture, and before the time appointed for the meeting in the gallery, their rooms were fitted up quite respectably, and Grattan's trunk and cloak were once more under the control of their owner.</p>
               <p>Now let us pause for a moment and contemplate the condition of Hugo and Grattan in their new quarters. Neither of them appears like the same person we have seen them but a few days ago, and this metamorphosis has been brought about by the sale of two pictures, amounting in the aggregate to about eighty dollars, which will be almost all swallowed up by debts already contracted and these new expenses. Artist-like, they have not asked or thought when they are to see any more, but, content and happy with present good fortune, they look no further.</p>
               <p>Let us call that inflated <emph>thing</emph> of broadcloth and gold chains who is just at this moment passing in his splendid equipage, fresh from the sacred precincts of upper-tendom, and ask him to alight and look in upon our two artists, and see how happy they have been made by so trifling an amount; and then ask him whether it would not be better for him—better for his family—better for the world—if himself and those like him, who are living in case and luxury, would invest a portion of that means which is expended for worthless nothings, in pictures from the hands of meritorious artists, very few of whom are really in any better condition than Grattan and Hugo Blanc, whatever outward appearances may seem to indicate.</p>
               <p>The public mind must become interested in this matter, or it is worse than folly even to anticipate anything but hopeless imbecility in the arts. With talent enough to build up a school that shall rival all the schools that ever existed, ancient or modern, surrounded by elements which call into full action the highest powers of genius—with a country which furnishes the greatest diversity of study to the artist of any in the world—we have the mortifying fact presented to us, that artists (except with the cultivated few) are held in little better estimation than paupers. Our government, even in the ill-considered commissions given to artists, is governed in its selections by political considerations; and it is entirely in the power of some brawling, wide-mouthed, unprincipled demagogue, to secure the filling of a panel in the Capitol of the nation to some sign and ornamental painter who happens to be one of his constituents; while the artists of real merit, already known to fame, are neglected, because, forsooth, "the claims of the West or the South must be attended to." To such influences we are indebted for our brass horse, poised upon his inflexible hind legs, mounted by an unimpressible Jackson, and similar abortions which disfigure the surroundings of our national Capitol. New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, all clamor loudly, and boast, trumpet-tongued, of their Art talent, and their efforts to sustain Art, and there is not one of them doing enough to give their best artists the income of the small dealer in gingersnaps at the street corners. Cincinnati, awhile since, made herself the laughing-stock of the whole Art world by sending to Europe, with the enormous fund of six thousand dollars, an incompetent agent to purchase Art works which are to be the nucleus of a future great "Western School of Art;" while she can not, or does not, give to the meritorious and deserving artists who reside in her precincts even a scanty support. When I think of these things, I am so filled with disgust that I am tempted to throw down my pen in despair; but the hope that something good may yet be accomplished, and the conviction that great evils are not to be cured by neglecting them or covering them up, impels me to speak, and speak plainly, the unvarnished truth, upon whomsoever censure may seem to fall. The reader will, therefore, excuse an occasional digression from my story.</p>
               <p>One o'clock found Grattan and Hugo in the gallery of the Art Union, where Byrnie and Brown had agreed to join them, previous to going out upon a walk. They were not kept long waiting; their friends soon arrived in excellent spirits, and after congratulating the two lucky artists upon their<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC6567-00000150"/> good fortune, it was decided to go forth and trust to chance to furnish amusement, and, returning in the evening, all sup together at some restaurant, as a finale.</p>
               <p>Under this arrangement, they wandered from place to place, wherever accident or caprice directed their steps; visiting, during the afternoon, the National Academy of Design, the Dusseldorf collection, where much was seen to be admired, and much to be laughed at; running through the collections of Mason &amp; Carter, and Graves &amp; Denny, as well as calling at several artists' studios and private collections to which they could get access. Byrnie was in very high spirits, and his witty sarcasms and humorous jokes, whenever opportunity offered to indulge in either, kept the company in the most excellent humor the whole of the afternoon.</p>
               <p>The supper, which was partaken of in the evening at a restaurant on Broadway, was enjoyed to the fullest, as not one of the number, except Hugo, had for a long time known what a good meal was; and when this was dispatched, and they were about separating, Byrnie, having a friend to meet at the Astor House, proposed to walk that far with Hugo, on his way to Joe Tyson's, and Brown and Grattan returned each to his domicil. Thus, to Grattan, had closed the first pleasant day he had known for many sad and weary weeks, and while he returns with Brown to his new abode, we will follow Hugo and Byrnie in their walk.</p>
               <p>"What a strange world!" said Byrnie, as they hurried along; "I have just been thinking what a trifling circumstance has made four poor devils happy for the first day in months, who may all be ready to hang themselves in despair before another week has glided into eternity."</p>
               <p>"It is, indeed, too bad, Byrnie, that our glorious Art must stand upon such a precarious footing."</p>
               <p>"Yes, it is, Hugo; the merchant, the mechanic, the lawyer, the doctor, can calculate with some certainty upon <emph>their</emph> profession, because they appeal to the necessities of mankind; but the labors of the artist appeal to their refined tastes alone, and as this article is so confoundedly scarce, his efforts are not appreciated or rewarded."</p>
               <p>"Do you not think there will be an improvement in this respect, Byrnie?"</p>
               <p>"Not so long as our youths are educated to believe that to make money is the sole end of our creation; not while wholesome recreation is looked upon as lost time; not while the multiplication table is considered of more importance than the Bible; not while tallow-faced ladies are pronounced 'pale and interesting,' and the rosy hue of health called 'vulgar;' not while the national maxim is, 'A pin a day makes a groat a year,'" he added, with a laugh.</p>
               <p>"That's enough, Byrnie; now I have a curiosity to know when you think all these difficulties will be removed?"</p>
               <p>"As soon," Byrnie replied, "as you can teach men that Art, in all its manifestations, is as worthy of encouragement as the trades and professions, and of as much use practically; as soon as you can teach women that thin shoes and tight lacing are injurious to health; as soon as you can teach young misses of thirteen that they are not young ladies; as soon as you can convince church-going saints that there <emph>is</emph> an essence in religion, pure and uncontaminated, and that the great Jehovah can neither be blinded by forms nor bought by gold; as soon as you can convince our business world that the qualifications for encouragement and employment should be honesty, integrity, and a reasonable intellect at least, and not simply the talent to make a lie seem like truth, when real honest truth would spoil a bargain. From present appearances, I don't think that either of these conditions will be brought about before Gabriel blows his trump! Now," he added, laughingly, patting Hugo on the shoulder, "if you expect to get rich, or even to live decently, by this profession, you see what your chances are. Get your slate when you get home, and cipher up your probable yearly receipts."</p>
               <p>Hugo could not help laughing at this queer way of giving an opinion; but it was plain enough to be seen, that at the bottom<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6567-00000151"/> tom of Byrnie's apparent humor, there was a conviction of the truth of the sentiments he uttered.</p>
               <p>"Do you suppose, Hugo," Byrnie continued, "that you could arrive at the definite sum per annum?"</p>
               <p>"Such a problem, Byrnie, would puzzle a greater mathematician than I profess to be. But, seriously, Byrnie, don't you believe that the Arts will be more respected and encouraged as the country grows older and becomes more intelligent?"</p>
               <p>"Well, then, seriously, Hugo, I don't believe anything of the sort, unless men are educated to think more of the head and heart, and less of the pocket and stomach, and there does not seem to be the slightest tendency that way yet. On the contrary, the evil is a growing one, and I doubt whether, taking the proportion of the artists to the population, they are now as well patronized as they were in the days of Stuart and Alston."</p>
               <p>"This is a melancholy and hopeless view of the case, Byrnie."</p>
               <p>"I know it is; but where is the remedy except in an entire change in the public sentiment as to what is best for man in this sphere of action?"</p>
               <p>"Are you serious, Byrnie?"</p>
               <p>"To be sure I am; why not?"</p>
               <p>"Well, if you <emph>are</emph> serious, tell me if you don't really believe that education will bring about this reform?"</p>
               <p>"Not under the present system, Hugo. It is too thoroughly 'practical;' and instead of cherishing the generous and noble impulses of youth, it goes deliberately to work to root them out, and a man is not considered finished so long as he exhibits a particle of feeling. But what in the name of all the saints are you staring at?" he exclaimed, putting his hand upon Hugo's shoulder, who himself had grasped Byrnie by the arm, and stood looking wildly toward a group who were just alighting from a carriage in front of the Astor House, near which they had stopped.</p>
               <p>"As I am alive!" cried Hugo, without noticing Byrnie's question, but evincing more and more astonishment, as the different individuals who had so suddenly appeared before him alighted from the carriage. "As I am alive, there is Father Grey helping Mrs. Grattan out! And there comes Mary!" he suddenly exclaimed, as her sweet face was for a moment turned toward him; and with suspended breath he still stood riveted to the spot, as another figure, supported carefully by old Grey, descended to the pavement, in whom he recognized Sharkey. Clinging to Byrnie, trembling with excitement, he whispered close in his ear: "That's Sharkey, Mr. Byrnie! what in the world can this all mean?"</p>
               <p>"Well, I declare, Hugo, that is a queer question to ask me; you seem, by your exclamations, to be acquainted with the parties; hadn't you better ask them? What the deuce do <emph>I</emph> know about Sharkey?"</p>
               <p>"Byrnie," said Hugo, still noticing the strangers, "that lady and the young girl are Grattan's wife and daughter."</p>
               <p>"Is it possible? Lord! Lord! have they come here to starve also? Who are the gentlemen with them, Hugo?"</p>
               <p>"One is named Grey and the other Sharkey," he answered; "this is all I can tell you about <emph>them.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Well, if you are acquainted with them," said Byrnie, "what do you stand here staring your eyes out for? Why don't you go up and speak to them."</p>
               <p>This was a thought which never seemed to have struck Hugo, so much was he staggered by this unexpected arrival, and the thousand unanswerable questions which thronged his mind. But as soon as the suggestion was made, he left Byrnie without apology, and, running up to Grey, who was about following the balance of the party into the hotel, seized him by both hands, and capered about like one gone mad.</p>
               <p>"Why, Hugo," cried Grey, taken as much by surprise as the other, "my poor boy, this is very lucky; where did <emph>you</emph> come from? Mrs. Grattan, Mary, and Sharkey," he added, in a whisper, "have just gone in—come you in also before you ask the thousand-and-one questions which I see are trembling on your tongue, and when we get settled in our rooms, we will explain everything;" and with these hasty words, he led<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6567-00000152"/> Hugo up the steps. Byrnie, lost in astonishment at what he saw, had not recovered sufficiently to follow, when Hugo came rushing back, and, seizing him by the arm, told him on no account to mention to a living soul anything he had seen, "and particularly not to Grattan," he said, "until I see you again. There is a tissue of mysteries surrounding him which I suppose is about to be unraveled, but neither you nor I must be known in the matter."</p>
               <p>More and more astonished, Byrnie gave his promise, and Hugo re-entered the hotel, where we will leave him, and ask the reader's indulgence while we go back to the little village of Coldwell, and explain those incidents which have transpired there to bring about this unexpected occurrence.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head>
               <head type="sub">OCCURRENCES AT COLDWELL—SURMISES CONCERNING HUGO—SHARKEY'S STORY—GREY'S STORY.</head>
               <p>THE morning after the departure of Hugo Blanc from his father's house was a melancholy one indeed, and the morning meal was dispatched without a word. For several days Mr. Blanc was fierce and brutal; Mrs. Blanc and Louise, patient, gentle, and forbearing, until even the iron-headed, leaden-hearted, practical Mr. Blanc, unable to find anything in the conduct of mother or daughter to feed his ugly temper, relapsed into a state of comparative quiescence, like the wife of Tam O'Shanter, however, "nursing his wrath to keep it warm," and ready, upon the slightest provocation, to make everybody and everything around him as miserable and uncomfortable as possible.</p>
               <p>Of course the village gossips were busily at work, and every man, woman, and child had a different story to tell, according to the different degrees of development of the organ of Marvelousness.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Burton said, with a mysterious shake of the head, that she knew very well what took him away. They were a high-tempered family, at any rate, and if she didn't lose her guess, the young chap would come to some bad end. He had lived long enough with them for her to form a correct opinion of his character. And such remarks were usually attended with mysterious shakings of the head, and a pious uprolling of the eyes, which told much more than her words.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burton had his suspicions, from what he knew of the<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC6567-00000153"/> young man, that his savage disposition, and nothing else, had taken him off; and added, "If his father's purse ain't lighter than before he went, then I will give it up that I don't know the boy. I know very well his father's notions, and I know he wouldn't give him money to go away on—and where do you suppose he would get it?" With this question, which Mr. Burton intended to convey his full meaning, if there had been any doubt about it, he would thrust his hands into his pockets, and look volumes of untold things.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Carter told Mrs. Brown, the lawyer's wife, who came to her a few days after Hugo's departure with some awful surmises in regard to the matter, that she and her husband, she thought, knew pretty well all about it. "Mr. Blanc had wanted to get the little rascal in our store, and Mr. Carter had his suspicions, from his leaving Burton in the way he did, that he might be light-fingered, and so refused to take him; and Mr. Carter says, from what he knows of Mr. Blanc, he has no doubt that when he learned what was the general opinion of the boy's character, he sent him adrift of his own accord. Mr. Blanc is a very pious man, you know, Mrs. Brown, and couldn't endure anything of that sort, even in his own son."</p>
               <p>"I have not been a bit surprised," Mrs. Brown would reply; "I just expected the boy would come to some bad end, for he spent most of his time in the woods and on the lake shore, doing nothing but making pictures; and if this wouldn't ruin any boy, I'd like to know, Mrs. Carter, what would?"</p>
               <p>The coachman who drove the coach from Coldwell to S——, and had picked Hugo up on the road, and carried him that far, said that Hugo was as noble a boy as ever lived, and couldn't be got to say anything more about him. But he believed, himself, that old Blanc was a d——d old brute.</p>
               <p>Dr. Draper thought that he had acted from the impulse of an irresistible love for Art, and that however unfortunate the matter might be, the poor boy ought not to be blamed, and he was sure he would some day make a noise in the world.</p>
               <p>The constable Wapping would'nt be "a hair" surprised if he stole a horse somewhere on the way. He was a candidate for—(here he passed his finger significantly around his neck)—or he didn't know nothin'.</p>
               <p>Old Grey, knowing all about it, said but little, except occasionally to silence sternly, and at once, any unjust aspersions, which he did most effectually when they were ventured in his presence.</p>
               <p>Smith and Lankton were unanimous in the opinion that Hugo was cut out for a low bully, and would, they laughed to believe, get into some scrape in New York where he would be most awfully "thrashed." Smith thought he would be most likely to turn his attention to picking pockets for a living, and Lankey didn't see what else he <emph>could</emph> do, for certainly he couldn't do anything at "that are d——d nonsense of painting."</p>
               <p>Indeed, for many days the entire village of Coldwell was in excitement upon the subject, and there was a greater stir and more running to and fro among neighbors, to get the last bulletin, than had been known for years. Surely, if to give employment to the idle can be considered praiseworthy, our hero ought to be looked upon in the light of a public benefactor, for all Coldwell were busy, with their tongues at least, from cellar to garret.</p>
               <p>We are sick of this gossip, and as it has but little to do with our story, we will ask the reader to visit with us old Grey's fishing hut, at the close of the day, about three weeks after Hugo's departure from home.</p>
               <p>There is no light in the outer room, and we will go forward and open the strong plank door and see what is going on there, for the light is glimmering through its cracks, and Grey must be with Sharkey.</p>
               <p>On opening the door, we see Grey sitting by the table, which has a light burning upon it, his head resting in the palm of his hand, his elbow on the table, and his keen eyes riveted upon Sharkey, who sits opposite with downcast looks, pale, emaciated, but still with a snake-like expression<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC6567-00000154"/> in his eye, which indicates that it would not be safe even now to trust him too far. Grey seems to be perfectly aware of this, for at his side upon the table convenient to his hand, is a silver-mounted pistol, elegantly wrought, with the trigger set so that it can be used at a moment's warning. Sharkey is trembling from head to foot beneath the stern gaze of the old man, and his fingers are working with the chain of his watch, and while his whole manner indicates the utmost mental excitement, the wild look of the maniac has not yet entirely left him.</p>
               <p>"Now, Duncan," Grey began, in a firm voice, "after years of hunting and tracking I have at length succeeded in trapping you—and although in a very different manner and under different circumstances from what I proposed, the result will be the same. I have watched you and cared for you for six weeks, through the most terrible insanity, and have heard enough to freeze my blood. You may be perfectly assured that all this trouble would not have been endured unless I was determined to accomplish my object. I am sorry, Duncan, to say that, notwithstanding the terrible lesson you have received, there does not seem to be such a change in you as I hoped for; I have no confidence that you would not make another attempt upon my life, and I am here prepared," he added, placing his hand upon the pistol in a manner not to be mistaken, "not only to meet any such effort, but to prevent your escape. I have removed the chain which confined you while you were a maniac, not because I consider you any less dangerous, but because I do not wish to see you treated like a felon, and because I am and shall always be prepared to protect myself, and," he concluded, looking at him sternly, "you know that I am able and determined to do so.</p>
               <p>"Now, Duncan, tell me why you undertook to deprive me of my life? there must have been some deep motive, and I am determined to know what it was. I had taken you from your poor mother and adopted you as my son; I had given you every advantage of schools and universities, and expended large sums to enable you to acquire a knowledge of the legal profession. I could not have treated you more kindly if you had really been my own son."</p>
               <p>"Yes," answered Sharkey, doggedly, "this is all true—but I <emph>was not</emph> your son."</p>
               <p>"Did this ever make any difference in my treatment of you? Did you not have your horses, your dogs, your guns, your private servant? I repeat—if I had been certain that my own son was living, and he had been with me, I could not have done more for him; and after all these kindnesses you undertook to cut short my life, which at best could not endure many years, and stain your soul with murder, for what purpose I suspect—and am determined to know whether my suspicions are correct."</p>
               <p>"My motives," Sharkey replied, looking at him for a moment fiercely, "are locked within my own breast; how will you force them from me?"</p>
               <p>"By placing hand-cuffs upon your wrists," Grey answered, "and returning you to England to answer to the laws of your country, not only for this crime, but for others which have come to my knowledge."</p>
               <p>This sentence, delivered with firmness and decision, one hand resting meantime significantly upon the pistol, made a perceptible impression upon Sharkey, and when Grey had done speaking, he bowed his head forward upon the table and was silent.</p>
               <p>"Duncan, there is no alternative; you must submit to one of these two things—either tell me why you attempted my life, and then fled to America, carrying my papers with you, or return to England in charge of an officer."</p>
               <p>Sharkey still remained with his head bent forward upon the table.</p>
               <p>"What did you want with my will?" Grey continued, keeping his eye upon him, "that you should have taken that away with you?"</p>
               <p>Sharkey raised his head slowly, and looking the old man earnestly in the face, asked: "Do you recollect, sir, what were the provisions of that will?"</p>
               <pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC6567-00000155"/>
               <p>"Certainly I do," Grey answered; "but this only surprises me the more. In the event that my son should have been lost at sea with his mother, as was rumored and generally believed, you were to be my sole heir; but if he should be living, and ever return to England, the bulk of my estate was to go to him, leaving, however, in this event, an ample allowance for you. This was the substance of it."</p>
               <p>"Can you not see a motive for my conduct, sir," said Sharkey, "in the hope of becoming, in spite of the reservation in favor of your son, sole heir to such an estate?"</p>
               <p>"And how?" Grey asked, gazing steadfastly at Sharkey.</p>
               <p>"By removing <emph>every</emph> obstacle that might stand in the way of such a wish."</p>
               <p>"Merciful God!" the old man exclaimed, "then my suspicions have been well founded; for this purpose you attempted my life, and came to this country for the purpose of—"</p>
               <p>"Finding your son," came with a sepulchral tone from Sharkey, who again fell forward upon the table.</p>
               <p>"Did you find him?" cried Grey, starting forward and seizing him by the arm—"did you find him, Duncan?"</p>
               <p>"I did!" Sharkey answered, without raising his head—"I did, after a year's search."</p>
               <p>"In which I followed you," said Grey, and then asked: "where did you find him, Duncan?"</p>
               <p>"Here, in this place," he replied, without changing his position.</p>
               <p>"And his name is?" the old man asked, leaning forward with his lips apart.</p>
               <p>Sharkey raised his head from the table, and looking him in the face, repeated firmly and clearly—"Grattan!"</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha! ha!" Grey burst forth with a wild, shrill laugh. "It is so, then! it is so, then!" then suddenly changing his manner, he raised his hands fervently, and exclaimed: "Oh, God! thou hast moved a father's heart aright, and the yearnings I have felt toward this man have been the promptings of the internal voice which whispered that he was the long-lost son. Oh, Duncan," he continued, bending forward over Sharkey and weeping bitterly, "how could you find it in your heart, after all the kindnesses I had showered upon you, to weave together such a tissue of horrible crimes?"</p>
               <p>"God knows, sir," said Sharkey, for the first time moved from his stolid air of indifference, "where the impulse came from, but I determined to possess myself of your estate at all hazards."</p>
               <p>"But when you found my son, Duncan, what did you propose to do?"</p>
               <p>"Do you think, sir," Sharkey answered, eying him with one of those stony looks which few can put on—"do you think that one who could deliberately plan <emph>one</emph> murder would stop at <emph>another,</emph> if necessary to secure his object?"</p>
               <p>"Duncan! Duncan!" Grey exclaimed, scarcely believing his senses; "and you tell me this with an eye that never quails and a cheek that does not crimson with shame and remorse? Do, for Heaven's sake!—for your <emph>own sake</emph>—acknowledge that you feel some little penitence and sorrow for your past life."</p>
               <p>"What my feelings are will matter but little now, sir. I am in your power, and must tell you all that you wish to know. If I had the past few years of my life to live over, I should act very differently—I think I should appreciate what you have done for me. But a few years, sir, with the devil at your side continually, as your <emph>only</emph> counselor, hardens the heart, I very much fear, beyond any softening process that can be brought to bear upon it. If you desire it, sir, I will tell you the whole story from beginning to end, and you will then know how I was tempted and led on by degrees, until to turn back would have been as fatal as to proceed."</p>
               <p>"Go on, Duncan," Grey answered, at the same time seating himself to hear what was to follow; "go on. I am rejoiced that <emph>you</emph> make the proposal. A confession is half the road to repentance."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, sir," Sharkey commenced, encouraged by his uncle's manner, "when we left London, after my poor mother's death (and after I had pretty much gotten through my<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC6567-00000156"/> law studies), and went to reside at your country seat on the coast, near B——, you remember that I had nothing to do but amuse myself in any way that my caprice suggested. I often, while there, spent hours of my time in your library; and when wearied here, resorted to the gun, dogs, and horses, to help me to dispose of time which often lagged wearily on my hands. You recollect Sharpe, who came to this country with me?"</p>
               <p>Grey nodded.</p>
               <p>"Well, sir, Sharpe was my constant companion. One day we were scouring over the country upon horseback, and had talked of everything connected with my own personal affairs, prospects, and intentions, when Sharpe suddenly asked me:</p>
               <p>"'Did you know that Mr. Hewson had been married twice?'</p>
               <p>"I said I did, and that I knew you had sent your first wife and son to America, and that they were lost in crossing the Atlantic. What you sent them for, I did not know. He then informed me that your first marriage had been a secret lone, and that you were required by your father to marry a very wealthy lady, for the purpose of uniting two large estates; that you resisted, and excused yourself as long as possible; and, finally, unable to put him off any longer, as he threatened to disinherit you unless you obeyed, you were obliged to send your first wife and child to the United States, under the promise of following as soon as you could dispose of some property which you held in your own right. Is this so far true, Mr. Hewson?"</p>
               <p>"Alas! too true," the other replied, with deep emotion; "but go on."</p>
               <p>"Well, sir, as I understood him, your wife and child sailed immediately; and while you were busy making all preparations to follow, first came a rumor, which was afterward confirmed, that the vessel containing your wife and child was lost, and all on board perished."</p>
               <p>Poor Grey sobbed aloud, and Sharkey paused for a moment until his grief should subside. "Go on," he said, at length, wiping his eyes; "what next?"</p>
               <p>"You were not given time to recover from this blow, before this second marriage was forced upon you, and was consummated. Before a year rolled around, your second wife died, leaving no children. About this time you adopted me, sir; you raised me, schooled me, and lavished all those little kindnesses upon me which would have been lavished on your own son. This we will pass over," he added, wiping the moisture from his forehead, "and come down to the time at which I commenced my story. Sharpe asked me if you had made a will in my favor. I told him I did not know, and he advised me, with a peculiar expression, to look to it, as this 'drowned brat,' as he termed your son, sir, 'might turn up some day and give me trouble.' We separated, and I rode slowly home. I don't know why, but these few words of Sharpe's were ringing constantly in my ears. I could think of nothing else. Arrived at home, I went as usual into the library, where I found a note lying on the table from you, telling me that you had been suddenly called to London on business, to be gone two or three days, and telling me to be careful to superintend the setting out of a new hedge which you were planting around a piece of ground, which was to be converted into a pleasure-garden, and contain a fountain, fish-pond, etc., which were all in process of construction. Do you recollect the note, sir?"</p>
               <p>"As though it was written but yesterday," Grey answered, now more and more interested in what he heard. "Proceed!"</p>
               <p>"Well, sir, after reading the note, I got to thinking of the new improvement, of your extensive estates, and then came naturally a wonder whether you had made a will. This, though simple curiosity at first, soon became a wish, and then a determination, to know whether such was the case or not. I ordered the servants not to disturb me on any account until tea-time, and returning to the library, locked the door, closed the blinds so that only a kind of twilight illuminated the room, and went systematically to work. I did not look among your ordinary files of papers, because I reasoned with myself, that your will would most likely be in some out-of-the-way<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC6567-00000157"/> the-way or secret drawer. I hunted everywhere to no purpose, and at last, when the day was nearly gone, I took down your little traveling-desk, and, after considerable trouble, succeeded in unlocking it with one of my own keys. Once into this, I found many letters from your wife—your first wife—and one in particular written from Liverpool the evening before she sailed, giving the name of the vessel (the Mary Ann) upon which she took passage, and begging you to follow as soon as possible, as she should be alone among strangers, and whatever her resources, unhappy until you joined her. I am thus particular that your mind may recollect all these things."</p>
               <p>Grey bowed without uttering a word.</p>
               <p>"Upon further examination, not yet finding anything like a will, I discovered that there seemed to be a false bottom to the desk; and after a long search, I found a concealed spring which opened this part of it, and there I found what I was searching for. I read it through eagerly, and when I discovered that my interest in your estate depended upon your son's death, and that I was but to have comparatively a small portion if he should by any accident have been saved, I, for the first time, began to long to know myself sole heir. Upon the bottom of the will was a note in which you had named the vessel in which your wife had sailed, and also that the vessel was lost on the coast of New Jersey, United States of America.</p>
               <p>"During the whole remaining time of your absence I thought of nothing else; the idea burned in my brain, that expectations which I had nursed for years might at any time be blasted by the return of this son.</p>
               <p>"When you came home from London I was surly, moody, dispirited to such an extent that you noticed it; and thinking that I needed recreation and amusement more than I found there, you put a well-filled purse in my hand one morning, and told me to take a servant with me and go for a few weeks to a neighboring watering-place and try to recruit my spirits. This you will also remember."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes," said Grey; "go on! go on!"</p>
               <p>"My time here was passed in one continued round of pleasures, which only made me prize the position I occupied more highly, and made me occasionally dwell with alarm upon the possibility that I might at any time be torn from it, and placed in one of comparative poverty—</p>
               <p>"I will hasten on, Mr. Hewson, as fast as possible. One evening, returning in a small sail-boat, with a couple of old sailors, after a day's sailing which I enjoyed very much, when, within a few miles of port, we were overtaken by a violent gale which put our lives in serious jeopardy. We were driven far out to sea, and the prospect that our small craft could live long in such a gale was very slim indeed. At length one of the sailors said to the other, looking landward: 'Tom, if this continues we are gone; we can never weather it through.'</p>
               <p>"'I don't like the look of it,' the other replied; 'it has precisely the appearance of a gale I once told you of on the coast of New Jersey.' I was all ears at this remark.</p>
               <p>"'Ah, Tom,' his companion replied, 'that was a narrow escape; it was a beautiful craft. The Mary Ann, sir,' he remarked to me, 'lost many years ago, when Tom, here, was a boy.'</p>
               <p>"As these words struck my ear, the danger, the storm—everything was forgotten. I seized the man by the arm and asked him if he was on board of that vessel when it was lost. He answered me that he was. Then followed question after question, until I had drawn from him that himself, another sailor, a woman and her son, were the only persons saved. That the woman died from long exposure and fright soon after they landed, and that the boy was left, he believed, in the care of an old woman whose husband was a professional wrecker. To make sure that I had now a clew to your son, I asked him if there were any more children on board. He told me that there were several women, but that this was the only married one on board, and that she was sailing alone, without any protector.</p>
               <p>"For the remaining two or three hours that we were driven about by the storm I recollected nothing; I had but<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC6567-00000158"/> one idea, one thought—and that was, that it was now certain that my rival lived, and that accident might at any time establish his identity. I felt that the long-cherished hope that I was to be sole heir to your possessions was likely at any time to be blasted. I thought of nothing else, and was not aroused until we made land in a little sheltered nook beneath the cliffs, but a mile or two from your house. What fearful project entered my head here, you will better understand by-and-by.</p>
               <p>"Paying the boatmen here, I returned home on foot, and sent word by them to B—— that my servant and horses should be ordered back. I did not care to return.</p>
               <p>"You met me in the vestibule with a glad and surprised smile at my unexpected return, and to your questions I gave very vague and incoherent answers. The danger which threatened me had taken possession of my mind, and your kind inquiries and anxious fears for my health were lost upon me.</p>
               <p>"Now commenced the struggle which ended in my attempt upon your life. How my plan was developed I can hardly tell. For weeks I struggled against suggestions of that spirit of evil who now never left me for a moment. I only thought of one thing, that I must be recognized as your heir; I must be in undisputed possession before there was any possibility of your learning that your son yet lived. In short, reflect on, and revolving all the circumstances and chances in my mind, gradually convinced me that my only safety was in taking your life, and afterward following your son to America and also close his life effectually, and thereby prevent the possibility of any trouble in the future in regard to my inheritance.</p>
               <p>"This conviction once established, I was not slow in perfecting my plans. You will recollect how I got up the excursion to the cliffs to shoot sea-gulls; and you know how eagerly you consented to accompany me, in the hope that the exercise would relieve me from my melancholy. Our horses were saddled and brought out, and we rode away for the cliffs which beetled above the sea at about a mile distant—you full of life and animated conversation, and I so preoccupied that I many times did not hear what you said, and often forgot to reply. The more taciturn I seemed, the more you exerted yourself to arouse and interest me—but to no purpose. Arrived near the place, we left our horses at the cottage of a peasant and proceeded on foot; but I was so completely absorbed in my own reflections, as we approached the place of our destination, that I ceased entirely to notice what you said to me, and as we walked along I often caught your eyes bent inquiringly upon me, as if asking yourself what could be the cause of such depression. We soon arrived upon the edge of the high, bold cliffs, and paused for a moment to enjoy the delightful sea-breeze and admire the beautiful prospect. The sea stretched away from a point far beneath our feet, until the eye ached in the effort to fix itself upon the line which separated it from the sky. Thousands of sea-gulls were flying above, around, and beneath us, and with the exception of these and a few fishing-smacks, which were slowly crawling along the coast, miles away, there were no signs of life. I looked about us and satisfied myself that we were alone.</p>
               <p>"The sport soon commenced in good earnest, and the wild screaming of the birds, mingling with the reverberations from cliff to cliff along the coast, as our murderous fire scattered the flying masses, soon interested <emph>you,</emph> at least, most effectually. The sun at length went down in unclouded splendor, and night began to close in around us. As we were walking along the cliff close by the margin, a large flock of gulls came flying toward us. We were standing upon a portion of this cliff that shot out far over the water, so far that it was impossible, from the top, to see anything beneath. You called me to your side, with both barrels of your gun ready, and told me that you were going to see how many of the birds you could drop into the water. Now, the opportunity I had been watching for all day suddenly presented itself, by your own act, and I drew closely to your side as you leveled your piece at the approaching flock of birds. Both barrels were fired at once, and as we stooped forward to see the dead and<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC6567-00000159"/> crippled descending into the abyss below, I suddenly pushed you forward, and you plunged over the precipice and disappeared, with a wild shriek that curdled my blood. I stopped a moment and heard your voice as you struggled in the water below, screaming for aid, and I did not move from my position until you had ceased to make any noise, and I was satisfied that you must have gone to the bottom. I felt that it was impossible for you to escape, encumbered as you were with your shot-pouch, game-bag, and heavy boots, and even if it had been possible to swim for an hour, I knew you could not in that time reach a point where you could get to the top of the cliff.</p>
               <p>"Satisfied that the deed was consummated, I hurried, with all the frantic wildness I could assume, to the place where we had left our horses; gave the peasant a plausible story of your having accidentally <emph>fallen</emph> over the cliff; directed him, in a distracted manner, to mount your horse and hurry to the little fishing hamlet about a mile below, and send around all the boats he could muster, while I rode home at the top of my speed to alarm the household, and bring out all the servants whose aid could be made available, that no means might be left untried to rescue you—or, rather, to conceal my own guilt. It is enough to say, in conclusion of this part of my story, that not the slightest vestige could be found of you, and the various parties returned after searching nearly all night. So well feigned was my distress and sorrow, that so far from being suspected of any connection with your death, I soon became an object of sympathy with the whole neighborhood, and every effort was made to wean my mind from my sad loss. Weeks and months passed; the will, from which I had cut your little note at the bottom, was found, and I became, in due form, the acknowledged heir to all your possessions.</p>
               <p>"I only waited a sufficient time to prevent my movements from attracting attention, when I determined upon a voyage, ostensibly for pleasure and amusement, to America. I employed Sharpe as a kind of servant-companion, and as he was a fitting tool, I made him partially my confidant. Before I go on, Mr. Hewson, you must tell me how you escaped, so successfully to baffle my schemes."</p>
               <p>Thus appealed to, Grey, who had been perfectly petrified at the deliberation and coolness of Sharkey's plans, answered him as follows:</p>
               <p>"The explanation shall be simple and in few words, as what remains to be told of your story will be more interesting to me than that I have heard—most of the facts you have narrated being already familiar to me. When I arose to the surface of the water I struck out with all my might for the cliff, shricking for help with every breath, hoping that I might, at least, find some projection that would sustain me above water until aid could arrive, if any should be within sound of my voice. I had not yet reached the point I had started for, when a boat, with a single rower, turned an angle in the rock from a little cove, and pulled manfully toward me. I could not have struggled much longer when I was taken into the boat. I suspected your motive, in part, and determined to put no obstacle in your way for a time, but to keep you under the closest surveillance, myself disguised, and see if I could not penetrate the motive which had led you to the attempt upon my life—an attempt so inexplicable to me that I felt certain you must have been moved to it by some powerful reason—much to my interest to fathom. A suspicion, I can not tell why, at this time fastened itself upon my mind that your conduct had some connection with my long-lost son. This was passing through my mind as I sat in the boat, and I was not aroused until the boatman abruptly said—</p>
               <p>"'Well, my old cove, you take your bath very coolly; where do you want to go?'</p>
               <p>"I enjoined strict silence upon him; told him that an effort had been made to murder me, and directed him to change clothes with me as soon as possible, and land me at the first convenient place. He did not altogether like the idea of putting on my wet hunting suit, but a gold watch which was in my pocket, and which I gave to him with the clothes, reconciled him to the exchange. This arrangement once concluded, I<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC6567-00000160"/> told him to land me at the first convenient place for me to reach the summit of the cliff, and as he rowed along I told him all that I desired him to know in regard to my plan for thwarting you, and enjoined the strictest secrecy. As an inducement to this, I told him that I would make him a present of three hundred pounds so soon as my plan should be accomplished. He found a place in the course of a mile where I could clamber up the rocks, and I told him to get home with his boat as quickly and quietly as possible, answer no questions, and join me immediately at a little hotel on the B—— road, but a few miles from my residence.</p>
               <p>"Here he procured post-horses for me, and in less than an hour I was flying toward London as fast as a pair of fleet animals could carry me. Here I had a confidential interview with my banker, as this was necessary in order to secure what funds I needed to carry out my design, and I gave him orders to permit you, if you were regularly acknowledged as my heir, to manage my deposits as you saw fit.</p>
               <p>"To make the story short," Grey added, "from that time to this I have had my eye upon you; I have been always near you, and although you sometimes escaped me for a few days or weeks, I was always fortunate enough to find you again. It was after having lost sight of you for some time, that I at length discovered you here, and your marked persecution of Grattan had, before your meeting in the woods, satisfied me that you had some powerful motive for such conduct. I watched you constantly night and day. I prepared this place for you, determined, if opportunity offered, to seize you myself, and confine you here until you told me all you had learned, if anything, in regard to my son, and make certain that my suspicions were correct and Grattan the man. The meeting in the woods saved me this trouble, although it nearly resulted in the loss of all my labor, from the serious after-consequences to yourself.</p>
               <p>"Now, Duncan, my story is done, and I am very anxious, as you may well conceive, to hear the conclusion of yours."</p>

               <head type="sub">SHARKEY'S STORY CONTINUED—HOW GREY PURSUED AND FOUND HIM—SHARKEY'S CONTRITION.</head>
               <p>"WELL, sir," Sharkey began, after pausing a moment and wiping the perspiration from his forehead, "I took ship at Liverpool and sailed for New York, where I arrived without any accident or meeting with any event of interest; and after I had secured lodgings and become fairly domiciled, I began to cast about me as to the best manner of proceeding to accomplish my purpose. I first went to a newspaper office and obtained the privilege of looking over the old files, and in the course of a few hours I had the satisfaction of finding a lengthy account of the loss of the Mary Ann, which stated that all hands (crew and passengers) were lost, consisting of from some seventy-five to one hundred souls. This account represented the wreck as having occurred on the coast of New Jersey, and noticed the fact that every exertion was made by the inhabitants of the little fishing village of —— to rescue the passengers, but that the surf was so heavy that all the boats sent out were swamped before they reached the shore. This notice of the occurrence made me again doubt the story of the sailor at B——, and I began to accuse myself for having stained my soul with a deadly crime to accomplish that which would have been accomplished without the commission of such a sin. Looking further and more carefully, I found another article, which asserted that a seaman or two and one or two passengers were saved, but gave no further particulars. I had learned enough for my<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC6567-00000161"/> purpose, however, and left New York upon the first boat, landed at ——, only a few miles from the point indicated, and was soon driving along the beach in a chaise, hired for the purpose, in the direction of ——. Once here, I made inquiries of all the old residents I could find in regard to the wreck of the Mary Ann, but could find no one who recollected anything about it. There had been so many vessels wrecked from time to time upon the neighboring coast, that this particular one seemed to have been forgotten. At length, and after I was about to give up in despair, an old veteran, who had been listening to some of my inquiries, directed me to a rude hut, not far from where we were standing, and told me that there was an old woman there by the name of Stiles, who was one of the oldest residents, and whom he had heard mention something about such a vessel wrecked some years before. Thither I went, without delay, and learned all that was to be learned from her."</p>
               <p>"What did <emph>she</emph> tell you?" Grey asked, eagerly.</p>
               <p>"She first refused to tell me anything unless I would pay her handsomely, as, she said, she knew enough to satisfy her that there was money in the knowledge she possessed. It was no time for me to be backward, and I feed her liberally, promising to do more if I found her information to be what I wanted. She then told me, sir, that a lady and child were among the saved; that the lady died a very short time after coming ashore, and that she left in her keeping sundry small matters, besides her own clothing, which she requested should be given to her son, should the old woman keep him until he grew up, and if anybody else took him she was to give these things to them, to be preserved for the boy to enable him to find his relatives when he arrived at man's estate. The old woman said that she dwelt so much upon this that she was satisfied that the lady had wealthy connections somewhere, and that while she was making the promise to do as the poor lady desired, she had already determined in her own mind to keep them herself, as the means of securing a handsome reward should inquiry ever be made by those interested. She would not even permit me to see these things unless I would secure her a large amount. She said she knew the lady's relations were rich; that she believed me to be one of them, and that if we wanted any information from her, we must pay for it. I acknowledged that I was a relative; that I was willing to pay her well for her information, and asked her if she knew where the lost boy was then; she answered, that when she last heard from him he was in Montreal, Canada, and that he was an artist. I learned his name from her, and also that he was married and had a family. I now proposed to her to go to New York, promising to make liberal provision for her and her daughter—my object being to remove her from her old haunts, so that if the authorities at home should get any hint that your son was living, sir, and make any inquiries for her, in tracing him out, it would be impossible to find her. Besides, sir, it would place her more completely in my power. To my surprise she consented readily to this proposal, as she said she had a nephew, or cousin, or some relative already residing there, and had always wished to go there herself. This matter, then, was all arranged without difficulty, and she seemed convinced that I was full of money and willing to pay any amount for what information she might be able to give me. A few days from this time found the old woman and her daughter settled in the basement-rooms of a house in one of the most obscure streets in the city, and, leaving her plenty of money for her immediate wants, I started without further delay for Montreal. It is of but little use, sir, to go into the particulars of my search for your son, and the trouble I found in tracing him to Coldwell. I followed him to Boston, Hartford, Philadelphia, Baltimore, New York, and finally to this place, where we have both been, as you know, for nearly two years."</p>
               <p>"But what were your intentions in regard to my son?"</p>
               <p>"I intended, when I came here, to kill him at the first convenient opportunity. But after some deliberation, I altered my plan and adopted another, which I thought would bring about this result without running any risk myself. I opened<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC6567-00000162"/> an office as an attorney, established Sharpe in it as my clerk, and having found out that Grattan was very poor and largely in debt, I purchased all the claims I could find against him, and commenced harassing him with these upon all occasions. I kept Sharpe a spy upon his movements, and although he frequently tried to finish pictures and get them to market without my knowledge, he never succeeded; and, with the exception of the one that was run up on me by Mr. Blanc's son, he never got anything like half price for his pictures."</p>
               <p>"But, Duncan, what was your motive in proceeding in this way? What did you expect to accomplish by such a course?"</p>
               <p>"I expected, sir, to exasperate him to make a violent attack upon me, and then to kill him in self-defense; for which purpose I went constantly armed with bowie-knife or pistol; and as Sharpe had promised to <emph>silence</emph> old Granny Stiles, I expected to return to England free from suspicion, and relieved of all further anxiety about your lost heir."</p>
               <p>"God of heaven! was there ever such villainy? and it was for the accomplishment of this purpose, Duncan, that you followed him into the woods on the night of your affray?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, he had been at my office on the same afternoon, and I tried every plan to exasperate him to attack me there, but did not succeed; and watching the direction he took I followed, hoping to meet him, as if by accident, and renew the conversation. How I succeeded you already know." After a slight pause, he suddenly asked: "Where are they now, Mr. Hewson? Where are Grattan and Sharpe? Why have I seen nothing of them?"</p>
               <p>"With suspicions almost amounting to certainties that Grattan was indeed my long-lost son, and fearing that you might have accomplices who would still do him some violence, I advised him to go to New York and study his profession there, and furnished him the means for that purpose. All these precautions were taken, not only for the reasons I have stated, but also to get him out of <emph>your</emph> way, should you by any accident escape, and at the same time avoid the consequences of any inquiries on his part into my motives, and thus risk the exposure of my whole plot before I had secured the information which your confession has given me. Sharpe went immediately to England the day after I brought you here."</p>
               <p>"In the frame of mind I was in at the time you allude to, I should have not only murdered Mr. Grattan, but <emph>yourself,</emph> Uncle Hewson, without a single compunction, for passion and disappointed ambition had entirely blinded reason."</p>
               <p>"Well, Duncan," Grey replied, in a deeply agitated voice, "this is the most ingeniously-woven web of villainies that I have ever known. I pity you, God knows, from the bottom of my heart, and I have no disposition or intention to subject you to a trial before the tribunal of your country for the crimes you have committed. I proposed from the first to secure you, and try the effect of forgiveness and kindness, knowing well that if these did not succeed you were hopelessly lost. I am yet willing, when you give me substantial proof of repentance, to make such provision for you as will secure you in comfort all your life, and put you above the possibility of ever again being tempted into crime. But until you do give me such proof, you must consent to whatever restraints I may choose to impose upon you."</p>
               <p>The blunted feelings of the self-accused wretch were touched by this unparalleled generosity, and he bowed his head, and for the first time in years wept like a child. The little spark of good which slumbers somewhere in the breast of every man and woman, no matter how depraved, had been reached in this monster, and once more roused into action by the noble generosity of the pure-minded old man, and he wept passionately for some time before he again ventured to speak. Suddenly he started to his feet, and walking up to Grey (who at the moment involuntarily laid his hand upon his pistol), fell upon his knees before him, and exclaimed, in piteous tones: "Uncle Hewson! I do not know how you found me out here, but I feel and acknowledge that the hand of God is in it, and I believe that <emph>He</emph> has kept my hand unstained of blood for wise purposes."</p>
               <pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC6567-00000163"/>
               <p>"I can soon tell you how I traced you out, Duncan, although I found great difficulty many times in getting any clew to your movements, often losing all trace of you for weeks. My first step when I arrived in New York, whither you could have preceded me but a short time, was to find the hotel where you had lodged; and here I found my greatest difficulty, as I did not know what name you had assumed, and felt quite certain that if your business was really what I suspected it to be, you would not run the risk of retaining your real name. After days spent in visiting hotel after hotel, examining registers, questioning clerks, porters, omnibus-drivers, to no purpose, a sudden thought came into my mind to make inquiries at the city banks, judging rightly that if you had made any arrangement to receive your remittances from home through any of these, you would most likely do so in your own name, to avoid exciting suspicion at home. This put me at once upon your track. Your American bankers were the Messrs. ——, in Wall Street. From these gentlemen I learned that you were in Montreal, and I followed you thither only to find on my arrival that you had gone again no one knew where. I ascertained here, however, that you had assumed the name of Sharkey, which was worth everything to me afterward, and I returned to New York to get again upon your track through your bankers, who sent me next to Philadelphia. I returned again to New York without having seen you, and followed your next remittance to Baltimore, where I saw you at the Eutaw House, and watched your movements for several days. Here you escaped me again, and I <emph>again</emph> returned to New York, and next followed you to Coldwell, and found that you had established yourself here as a lawyer. I knew now that if your object had been to trace out my son, you <emph>had,</emph> or thought you had, found him, and I adopted the profession of a fisherman as the one least likely to draw attention upon myself, assumed a fisherman's garb and habits, and to the best of my ability conformed to his mode of life in every particular. I prepared this part of my house expressly for you, intending, when the time came, to secure you here by force or stratagem; and if you had any evidence of the identity of Grattan (who, I was not long in discovering, was the individual you had hit upon), not only secure this, but at the same time reform and reinstate you in your character and position. Duncan! Duncan!" he exclaimed, in conclusion, "God has, indeed, been kind to <emph>you,</emph> kind to us <emph>all,</emph> in frustrating your designs. Wealth, however great, acquired in the manner you proposed, you could never have enjoyed."</p>
               <p>"I feel it, uncle! I feel it now! and it shall be the business of my life to repair, so far as possible, what I have done."</p>
               <p>"I will hope for the best," Grey answered; "but you must not expect me, Duncan, to put full confidence in you at once. Such heavy sins are not to be repented of or forgiven in a few hours or days. You shall have full advantage of all <emph>I</emph> have promised; the balance depends entirely upon yourself."</p>
               <p>Sharkey was walking to and fro as his uncle spoke, trying to conceal the remorseful feelings which his unexpected kindness aroused in him; and when he had stopped, started forward, and coming near him, with a countenance full of penitence and shame, exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"Oh, Uncle Hewson! this undeserved kindness and forgiveness will do more toward making me what I ought to be, than any punishment human ingenuity could inflict. I have often thought of the consequences of my conduct, but never until now have I harbored a thought of repentance. May God forgive me, uncle, as you have done!"</p>
               <p>"I am rejoiced, Duncan, to witness such tokens of penitence. It is true that you have attempted great wrongs upon me, but your last act has blotted out all remembrance of those. You have restored my son to me, and made a poor old father's heart glad for the balance of his life. You have given evidences of your determination to lead a different kind of life in future, and next to the discovery of my son, believe me, these evidences give me most heartfelt joy and satisfaction. Lie down now, Duncan, until I return from the village, whither I must now go, to impart these joyful tidings to Mrs.<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC6567-00000164"/> Grattan, and bid her prepare for a journey to New York, where we will <emph>all</emph> go as soon as possible to join my poor son, who shall never return to this miserable place, to be reminded of his past sufferings and disappointments."</p>
               <p>Grey left Sharkey, and, locking the plank door after him, with as much elasticity in his step as a boy of fourteen, he walked toward Coldwell.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE MYSTERY BROKEN TO MRS. GRATTAN AND MARY—TEARS AND SMILES—PREPARATIONS FOR DEPARTURE—GREAT WONDERMENT AMONG THE VILLAGERS.</head>
               <p>ABOUT nine o'clock on the same evening of the interview between Grey and Sharkey, Mrs. Grattan and her daughter were seated in the little parlor, the former with a letter in her hand which had apparently just been read, and Mary bending her head upon her hands in silence.</p>
               <p>"This is sad news, my dear girl," Mrs. Grattan observed, looking at her kindly; "but your father's letter says that he is about again; that they have taken a room together; that Hugo has sold a picture, and that their prospects are improved. He also says that Hugo is still with the kind people who took him in after his injury; that they will not part with him, and seem determined to make him as much at home as their circumstances will permit."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes! mother, this may all be true; but how terrible it must have been to poor Hugo to find himself in such a helpless condition among strangers, and not dare to ask relief from those who ought to be the first to render it!"</p>
               <p>"This is a very melancholy view of the case, truly, my dear girl; but we have the comforting information that he was not obliged to go to the hospital to be treated and cared for by strangers, but, however humble and lowly, fell among kind friends, who will not part from him, even now that he is able to be about again."</p>
               <pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC6567-00000165"/>
               <p>"Poor Hugo!" the girl exclaimed, "I wish <emph>I</emph> could have been with him; he should have found another friend who would have made any sacrifice for his comfort;" and stopping short, as if fearful she had said too much, she asked: "Would this have been right, mother?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly, Mary, it would have been perfectly right under the circumstances, but an evil-eyed world would handle such conduct severely."</p>
               <p>"I should care but little for what the 'evil-eyed world' might say, mother. If I was conscious of pure motives myself, my affections should be my guide."</p>
               <p>"Nobly spoken! my dear daughter; but we will be thankful that Hugo has been so well cared for, and hope for the best success upon all his efforts. The sale of his picture, and all the attending circumstances, certainly indicate that our best wishes are about to be realized."</p>
               <p>"Was not that a glorious triumph with that little picture of the dogs, mother?" she asked, joy and pride lighting up her beautiful face; "oh! I knew that Hugo must succeed; and now, mother, don't you really believe that this is but the first of many triumphs?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Grattan had seen too much of the world to adopt all her daughter's bright conclusions; but before she could reply, they were very much startled by a sharp rap at the door, and Mrs. Grattan, rising hurriedly to her feet, ran to see who was the visitor at that hour. To her surprise when she opened it, Grey entered, almost out of breath, and walking into the room, threw his hat upon the table, took a seat, and waited for Mrs. Grattan herself to be seated, before he said a word. Indeed, he seemed to be in that kind of embarrassment which one is apt to feel who starts upon some enterprise, to make some announcement, or impart some unusual information, and suddenly comes upon the parties to whom the communication is to be made, without having thought what he would say or where he would begin.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Grattan looked at him with suspended breath and her hand pressed upon her heart, and his last words, as he turned to leave her on that fearful night when she visited him at his hut, came up vividly to her mind, and she knew that some revelation was about to be made of importance to them, or the old man would not have come upon them at such an hour. While these thoughts were passing through her mind, Grey turned to her daughter, and said to her: "Mary, my sweet girl, leave me a few moments with your mother, I have something important to communicate to her;" and, when the girl turned upon him with curious, inquiring eyes, he saw the tear-drops still standing in them, he took her hand affectionately, and added: "dry your tears, my daughter, I have that to tell your mother which will turn these into smiles of joy."</p>
               <p>Full of astonishment, Mary left the room, and no sooner had the door closed upon her than Mrs. Grattan started wildly from her seat, and going across the room to Grey, threw herself upon her knees before him, and cried out: "Quick, Grey! quick! Do not keep me a moment in suspense—what is it? Pray tell me, before I am incapable of understanding you."</p>
               <p>"Calm yourself, madam," Grey urged, alarmed at her wild appearance; "what I wish to impart to you will take some time, and require all your fortitude to hear."</p>
               <p>"I <emph>will</emph> be calm, Mr. Grey, only—go on—do! suspense affects me more than anything you can tell me."</p>
               <p>"Well, Mrs. Grattan, I have just within an hour finished a conversation with Sharkey, which enables me to clear up to you entirely the mystery connected with events which I have heretofore mentioned to you. He has been a maniac until within a few days, and I have not dared to press any inquiries upon him while there was the least danger that excitement might again dethrone his reason. I now come to g've comfort to your heart, Mrs. Grattan, and promise you ample compensation for all that you have suffered." As the old man said this, he turned his head from her and covered his face with his hands.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Grattan, excited to the utmost already by this unexpected visit, was wild almost at the words he uttered, and<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC6567-00000166"/> clasping his hands passionately, exclaimed: "What is it, Grey? do not keep me in suspense; my brain is dizzy already, and you must tell me at once!"</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Grattan," he replied, impressively, "Sharkey is not what he has seemed to be."</p>
               <p>"Who is he, <emph>then?</emph>" Mrs. Grattan asked, with parted lips and staring eyes; "who is he?"</p>
               <p>"He is my nephew, madam."</p>
               <p>"Your nephew! and you, Mr. Grey!" she cried, holding her breath; "you?"</p>
               <p>"I am not what I have seemed, any more than Sharkey, Mrs. Grattan."</p>
               <p>"Then, who are you, sir? who <emph>are</emph> you?"</p>
               <p>"I am a man, Mrs. Grattan," he continued, his voice trembling more and more as he proceeded, "who, though born to immense wealth, has yet, by cruel fate, been rendered unhappy through life. Years ago a wife and little son were torn from my arms by circumstances cruel in the extreme, but beyond my power to control, and came from England, my native country, to these United States. The vessel in which they sailed was lost—the mother perished, but the son was saved—and after years of anguish, after years of suffering, a father's heart palpitates with joy in anticipation of a restoration of this long-lost boy."</p>
               <p>"And this boy! Oh! tell me, Mr. Grey," she cried, partly comprehending what was to follow, and springing wildly to her feet; "this boy, Mr. Grey, is—"</p>
               <p>"Your husband! Mrs. Grattan," the old man sobbed, unable longer to suppress his feelings.</p>
               <p>The wild shriek that followed this announcement startled the household, and the children burst into the room with faces filled with alarm, and beheld their mother in the arms of Grey, who laughed and wept by turns, and as they clustered around with cries and questions mingled in the utmost confusion, turning to one and the other, and kissing them with the greatest warmth and affection, he tried in vain to make himself understood.</p>
               <p>"Mother! mother! Mr. Grey!" Mary exclaimed, as soon as the excitement had somewhat subsided, "what has happened? What is the matter?"</p>
               <p>"Mary!" Mrs. Grattan exclaimed joyfully, taking her hand and putting it into that of the old man, "this is a new-found grandfather! This is your father's father, and this is the kind friend from whom so many delicate favors have been received during your father's absence. Is it not so, sir?"</p>
               <p>Grey nodded assent, and taking the fair girl in his arms, kissed her fondly, and mother and children crowded around him, giving themselves up to unrestrained bursts of tears and joyful exclamations of surprise, without waiting for an explanation of mysteries which must have suggested a volume of questions.</p>
               <p>"Oh, my poor husband!" Mrs. Grattan at length said, "how your excellent and worthy heart will swell at this news! How you will cling to that father whom you never knew, much less expected to see!"</p>
               <p>"We will join him immediately in New York, Mrs. Grattan," Grey answered, "and you must not keep a father's heart in suspense one moment longer than is necessary, but get all ready as soon as possible."</p>
               <p>"Are we all to go to New York?" Mrs. Grattan asked, joyfully.</p>
               <p>"Immediately, my daughter, or as soon as you can all be got ready. I shall sleep but little until I see my son, and restore to him those rights of which he has so long been deprived, as well as relieve his mind from doubts and fears, which must have caused him a world of unhappiness and grief."</p>
               <p>Here the old man, with these new objects of affection grouped lovingly around him, interested them deeply for an hour with a repetition of the fearful story of Sharkey, and his own troubles and vexations in tracing him out, and the transitions from hope to fear when he began to believe that Mr. Grattan was really his son. All this excited the most intense interest in his happy auditors, as well as the many curious anecdotes he related of the new life he had been<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC6567-00000167"/> living for the past two years, and the nervous fears he many times experienced that Sharkey would penetrate his disguise and frustrate all his hopes. It was curious to note the varied emotions expressed upon the countenances turned toward the old man as he proceeded, and see how perfectly they reflected his emotions, as indignation, anger, joy, hope, or fear were there depicted; and how, at his concluding words, each breast heaved with a long-pent sigh, and each heart seemed relieved of an oppressive load. "My son," he concluded, with a half dozen little hands clasped in his broad palm, "shall accompany me to England, as soon as I can get you all happily and comfortably settled, and remain with me until I can arrange my affairs to return again to the United States to spend the balance of my days, doing all in my power to make those happy who have suffered so much, not from my injustice, but from my misfortunes. This visit to England, my daughter," he said to Mrs. Grattan, "will afford to my poor son opportunities for study in his profession which will be of immense value to him, and whether his genius and talent are rewarded or not, thank God," he said, fervently, "will now make no difference to him. He shall no longer be dependent upon that for a subsistence, but shall have it in his power to aid those who, like himself, are victims to false notions, which hang with a leaden weight upon the true interests of the so-called civilized world. My daughter, my children," he concluded, impressively, "you shall all be as happy as abundant means can make you."</p>
               <p>These impressive remarks from the old man once more opened the floodgates, and tears of joy and happiness streamed from eyes that had known none but tears of grief for years. And he, as he beheld the effect of his story upon those who were henceforth to be so dear to him, and whom he rejoiced to find so worthy of the good fortune that had fallen upon them, was as much overcome as the little Enon, who cried with all his might, though too young to understand what could have caused this unusual exhibition of joyful emotions.</p>
               <p>Later on the same night Grey and Mrs. Grattan separated at the front door of the cottage, having made all necessary arrangements for leaving on the following Monday, he having provided her with ample means to furnish them for the journey in a befitting manner.</p>
               <p>The parting kiss, accompanied with a tear of joy which fell upon the old man's cheek as they separated, filled his soul with thankfulness for the comfort and happiness which were promised to his declining years; and he reached his home so buoyant in spirit and so light of heart, that he entered the outer room with an old familiar song upon his lips that had not been thought of for years.</p>
               <p>The following morning all was bustle and commotion, not only in Grey's hut, but in the little family of Mrs. Grattan; and the sudden breaking up of the fisherman's establishment, the unexplained reappearance of Sharkey, and the evident connection between the movements at the fisherman's hut and at Grattan's cottage, put the little village of Coldwell in a frenzy of excitement far surpassing anything that had ever been known there before.</p>
               <p>Busy feet were trotting from door to door, ears were open, and tongues active and flexible, to hear and to retail the particulars of this wonderful affair. Busy needles were flying at Mrs. Grattan's little cottage, where had been collected together all the assistance that could be found to prepare them for the approaching journey. Mary and her mother wore happy smiles in anticipation of happy meetings, toward which both were looking, and the boys capered and tumbled in the little front yard as if divested of reason. Grey quietly settled up all his own matters, paid off all claims against Grattan, but preserved the most profound silence in regard to what had happened; and public feeling, having nothing to feed upon but mere rumor, was almost frantic. Trunks were hastily procured and sent to Mrs. Grattan's, and the cartman who hauled them out returned with eyes staring and mouth wide open at what he saw there, and, in the absence of any true information, dealt out in no stinted doses, to crowds of<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC6567-00000168"/> curious listeners, the most improbable stories, which he swore he knew were every word true.</p>
               <p>Saturday evening found the trunks all packed, the furniture all sold, the little cottage on the mountain-side deserted, and the family of Mr. Grattan domiciled at the village hotel with Grey and Sharkey, ready to take the coach to S—— on Monday morning. Mrs. Blanc and Louise, fully apprised of the events which we have so rapidly passed over, spent the whole afternoon with Mrs. Grattan and Mary (the reader may be sure that many kind messages were confided to their care for the son and brother who were absent); and when they separated, unbidden tears, wrung from hearts that had long been united in the bonds of true affection, fell copiously. And when promises and assurances had been given and returned to meet again, and the parting embrace was received with fresh demonstrations of sorrow at the parting, Louise and her mother returned to the chilly atmosphere of their own home, to rejoice at the good fortune of these dear friends, and grieve at the cold and cheerless influences that surrounded themselves.</p>
               <p>Deeply interested female friends called to take an affectionate leave of the mother and daughter, who had never called upon them before, and returned home without having gained any knowledge to allay their feverish curiosity. Grey's hut and the adjoining cavern were ransacked, to try to gain some clew to these strange occurrences in their midst, but nothing was discovered upon which to hang a new tale, or give play to the marvelous invention of those who now busied themselves in the matter, as if a solution of the difficulty was a matter of life and death.</p>
               <p>Grey quietly issued his orders for such preparations as were necessary, and when the happy recipients of this wonderful stroke of good fortune retired to their pillows on this eventful Saturday night, the excitement in the village had reached to a pitch of which they were happily ignorant, and suspicions and surmises came thick and fast in many an anxious group at the street corners or in the home circle, which none could dispute or confirm.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE BLANC FAMILY—THE PRACTICAL MAN STILL UNRELENTING—CRUSHED YEARNINGS OF MRS. BLANC AND LOUISE.</head>
               <p>MR. BLANC has just returned from the village, and, as is his custom before partaking of his evening meal, he has seated himself in the library to look over letters and papers received by the mail. When we intrude again upon his privacy, he is sitting just where he sat some weeks before when he deliberately passed sentence of banishment upon his only son, and is holding in his hand a letter from that son to his daughter, and debating with himself whether he shall give it to her or destroy it. We do not wish to insinuate that such a bright example of the "practical man" as Mr. Blanc relented, or that there was anything soft in his nature—by no means, my practical reader; but a slight, a very slight curiosity to know how his son's efforts would succeed, induced the desire to know the contents of the letter, and Mr. Blanc was not quite so far gone as to break it open and read it without first giving it to her.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, when he came to the tea-table, he gave the letter to Louise, who hastened immediately to possess herself of its contents. It was a letter written to her by Hugo a few days after his mishap upon the landing; and although he told her that he was comfortably cared for and lodged, yet he was mortified and chagrined to find himself in a situation where he could not pay for the most trifling necessaries. He mentioned that he had offered his group of dogs for sale, and merely ventured the hope that they might bring enough to pay his kind entertainers for their trouble; and concluded by<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC6567-00000169"/> sending love to both father and mother, with many kind wishes for their health and happiness.</p>
               <p>When Louise had finished the letter, she handed it to her mother with tearful eyes, and sat down at the table too much affected to partake of the meal. Mrs. Blanc having read it also, passed it over the table to Mr. Blanc, who, although he had witnessed its effect both upon mother and daughter, could not lay aside his iron manner sufficiently to manifest the slightest interest, and when he took the letter from her he thrust it into his breast-pocket and quietly and leisurely finished his supper.</p>
               <p>Once in his library again, however, a close observer might have detected some little eagerness in Mr. Blanc's manner, for he hastily lighted his candle and uttered several expressions of impatience that the light for some time burned dimly; but when this difficulty was removed, he sat eagerly down and read his son's letter through. One would naturally suppose that a father reading such a letter from a son would be painfully affected by it, but the earnest expression with which Mr. Blanc commenced reading gradually relaxed, and when he finished and threw the letter upon the table, it had changed to a well-pleased smile. Without noticing the matter further, he lighted his accustomed cigar, and taking up a paper was soon absorbed in the list of new counterfeits, broken banks, prices of stocks, commercial intelligence, railroad bonds, and like practical matter, when Louise timidly entered and stood before him.</p>
               <p>"What do you want, Louise?" he asked, gruffly.</p>
               <p>"Are you done with Hugo's letter, father?" she asked, timidly.</p>
               <p>"Yes; take it along," he said, pushing it toward her carelessly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Blanc threw himself back again in his chair, resumed his paper, and had been some time thus engaged, when, looking over it at his daughter, he asked—</p>
               <p>"Well, why don't you go? What are you standing there for?"</p>
               <p>"Father," she asked, "won't you do something for poor Hugo?"</p>
               <p>"Do something for him, girl? what can I do for him? He has taken himself out of my jurisdiction," he said, with a bitter sneer.</p>
               <p>"You can send him some money, father, to pay those kind people who have so generously taken care of him."</p>
               <p>"Not a cent," he replied, decidedly and emphatically. "He has ventured to try his own resources against my express wishes, and he can take the consequences."</p>
               <p>Mr. Blanc resumed his reading, and Louise still maintained her position in silence. At length Mr. Blanc, out of patience with her pertinacity, threw down his paper again, and asked, angrily—</p>
               <p>"What are you stopping here for? Have I not answered you?"</p>
               <p>"Father," Louise asked, "may I sell my ear-rings and gold pencil? I don't want them."</p>
               <p>"Sell them, Louise! for what?" Mr. Blanc exclaimed, in astonishment.</p>
               <p>"I would send the money to Hugo, sir; I do not want them, and—"</p>
               <p>"You venture upon any such experiment as that, if you dare!" cried Mr. Blanc, sternly, "and I will teach you a lesson you will remember. Go to your mother, and don't trouble me again upon this subject."</p>
               <p>The poor girl retired, weeping bitterly, and the practical man again betook himself to his price current with the utmost unconcern. We will not dwell upon the tears that were shed in the quiet of their own rooms by both Louise and her mother, nor the stolid indifference constantly manifested by Mr. Blanc in regard to his son.</p>
               <p>In a few days a paper came to Louise, speaking of the scene at Mason &amp; Carter's—a complete triumph for her brother, even in so short a time—and full of joy, she ran into the library to show it to Mr. Blanc, thinking, poor girl, that her brother's success would soften his severity. Still did she<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC6567-00000170"/> misunderstand the heart of the practical man. He scolded fiercely, and threatened severe punishment if she ventured again to trouble him with anything pertaining to her brother, and Louise hastily retired, overhelmed with astonishment and grief. Study the human heart, sweet girl, and you will then know why your practical father smiled over your brother's letter which detailed his injuries, and then stormed over the newspaper account of his triumph. The explanation is simple: the first was in accordance with his expectations and wishes, and the last at war with both.</p>
               <p>Neither the persuasions of the daughter nor the prayers of the mother could ever move this iron man with leaden heart, and all efforts to effect such a hopeless task finally ceased. News from Hugo was received without comment, and in his own house he was to all intents and purposes dead, his name never being mentioned except by the mother and sister, and not by them in the presence of his father.</p>
               <p>At length the startling announcement of the wonderful good fortune of the Grattans, and the mysteries connected with it, the proposed journey to New York to join Mr. Grattan, came upon them with crushing weight, for the intercourse with these friends had been about the only relief from the sufferings and sorrows at home. Mrs. Blanc and Louise felt how utterly cold and cheerless their existence would now be; and to the latter, whose young heart felt the necessity of something to love, some congenial spirit into whose ear she could pour her little sorrows, joys, hopes, and fears, it seemed as if this last blow, coupled with the cruel separation from an idolized brother, would deprive her of all companionship, and, as a necessary consequence, of all happiness. Her mother seldom smiled, and seemed, since Hugo's departure, rather to endure than to enjoy existence, and in her many household duties, which were always scrupulously and exactly performed, she evidently tried to forget the cold, stony heartlessness of her practical husband. He never suffered himself to be moved by anything, as emotion of any kind was childish and silly to his practical mind; and the news which he heard in regard to the "beggar Grattan," produced neither outward manifestation of feeling or comment, except that when Mrs. Blanc expressed her joy at their good fortune, he simply remarked that it was likely indeed, but he didn't think that it could last long in the hands of such a "lazy, <emph>inefficient</emph> rascal as Grattan."</p>
               <p>To all such unkind and bitter remarks Mrs. Blanc had learned to turn a deaf ear, and never since the interview on the night of Hugo's departure had she ventured to cross him in any way.</p>
               <p>Thus the soulless policy of Mr. Blanc worked in his own family, who, surrounded as they were with everything that heart could wish, yet knew no joy, knew no sympathy, knew no more outgushings of feeling or sentiment, and from the time that the hall door was closed upon him in the evening until his departure in the morning, the mother and daughter were mere automatons. What a contrast to the house of Joe Tyson, the poor, ignorant hackman in New York! In the one case, wealth and luxury without refinement, without affection; in the other, poverty, ignorance, refinement, spirituality, affection. In one case, a home in the true sense to every member of the family; in the other, a home to none—not even the practical Mr. Blanc himself. He was the most miserable of all, yet had not discernment enough to know the cause. Indeed, a long life <emph>exclusively</emph> devoted to commercial pursuits had so identified his whole being with "facts and figures," that, except when among these, existence was a burden to him. He had neither will, inclination, nor capacity to enjoy anything else, and never even dreamed that exercise or wholesome amusement were more necessary to happiness in this life than any mere practical measures having money for their only object. But we will leave Mr. Blanc, with the chilling and disheartening influence which emanates from him. It is much pleasanter to dwell in the atmosphere of joy and happiness which surrounds the warm-hearted Grey, and we will part willingly from the man of figures and facts to follow again the man of heart, the man of soul, the<pb n="340-341" xml:id="VAC6567-00000171"/> spiritual man—the man whose life is devoted to higher and nobler purposes than the mere accumulation of gold; who sees in the Arts and Sciences sources of joy and happiness as pure as earthly joys can be, and lessons of veneration and love to the Great Artist, not to be found in money—not to be found in silks and broadcloths—not to be found in fine equipages—not to be found in the disgusting and heartless customs of merely fashionable society—in short, not found anywhere where men and women generally look for it. Reader, let us go with Grey.</p>

               <head type="sub">SCENES AT THE ASTOR HOUSE—GREY AND SHARKEY SEEK GRANNY STILES—INTERVIEW OF HUGO AND MARY—GRATTAN'S FRAME OF MIND.</head>
               <p>AFTER leaving Byrnie the second time, breathless with eagerness Hugo ran up the steps and rejoined Grey in the large vestibule of the hotel. He was giving orders to the clerk for a suite of rooms and private parlor; the ladies had already retired to doff their traveling habits, and Grey, turning to Hugo, led him aside where they would not be observed, and, when once by themselves, he said, with a smile—</p>
               <p>"Well, my poor boy, I suppose you are almost dying to know what this all means, and full of anxiety to see Mary," he added, patting him familiarly under the chin.</p>
               <p>Hugo hung his head and blushed at this unexpected speech, but answered that his curiosity was much excited to know what had occurred to bring himself, Mrs. Grattan, Mary, and, above all, Sharkey, to the city in company.</p>
               <p>Grey ran briefly through all the circumstances which have been narrated in regard to himself, Grattan, and Sharkey.</p>
               <p>While Hugo was still staring at him in astonishment at what he heard, the bustling clerk came up and announced to Grey that the rooms were ready, and the old man took Hugo by the hand and led him up a flight of stairs which communicated with the second floor, preceded by the clerk, who piloted the way to a beautiful suite of rooms with a parlor attached. Into this last room they entered, and there found Sharkey sitting by the window looking into the street, with a<pb n="342-343" xml:id="VAC6567-00000172"/> settled expression of sadness on his countenance which moved Hugo much. He arose as they entered, and coming forward took Hugo by the hand, pressed it kindly, but without saying a word, and was passing out, when Grey said to him—</p>
               <p>"Have they given you a room, Duncan?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," said Sharkey, "a very comfortable one."</p>
               <p>"You do not look well, my boy," said Grey, kindly taking him by the hand; "you had better go and lie down and try to get some rest."</p>
               <p>Tears sprang instantly into the eyes of Sharkey, and he turned suddenly away, and, with his handkerchief to his eyes, left the room.</p>
               <p>"Poor fellow!" said Grey; "he suffers immensely, and I really believe that he is sincerely repentant; he shall be well cared for, however, and if kindness can make him forget the past, it may all be well with him yet. Now, Hugo," he said, suddenly turning to him, "where is my son? Where is Grattan? is he well? is he in any better spirits?"</p>
               <p>"Mr. Grey," said Hugo, to whom all that he had heard and seen yet seemed like a dream, "I am so utterly bewildered with surprise and astonishment that I can scarcely believe my senses."</p>
               <p>"Well," Grey answered, nervously, "you must recover from your astonishment immediately. There is much to be done on the instant, for you will readily understand that I shall delay as little as possible the announcement which fills my heart with joy, and is to lift my poor boy from the misery through which he has struggled all his life."</p>
               <p>"What can <emph>I</emph> do, Mr. Grey?" said Hugo, eagerly wiping the moisture from his eyes, and his heart big with suppressed joy and excitement, "what can I do?"</p>
               <p>"Go order a carriage to the door," Grey exclaimed, full of agitation. "Sharkey and I must visit this woman Stiles before I can see my son, and by the time the carriage is at the door he will have recruited sufficiently to accompany me to her abode. In the mean time, you must stay with Kate and Mary until we return."</p>
               <p>"Grattan your son! Visit this woman Stiles!" Hugo exclaimed, with a bewildered air. "You forget, Mr. Grey, that I am yet utterly ignorant of your meaning. How can these things be? and how is it that I see Sharkey here, and alive?"</p>
               <p>"True! true!" Grey exclaimed, with a laugh. "I had forgotten, in my eagerness, that you were not fully informed of all that has transpired since you left home. But call the carriage now, Hugo, I have more pressing duties to dispose of. Mary will explain all these mysteries to you, meantime."</p>
               <p>Hugo hurried down to give directions accordingly, while Grey visited Sharkey's room, and found him, not lying down, but ready to start at any moment, as he said that he did not wish to sleep until this was all over.</p>
               <p>Hugo returned to the little parlor in a very few minutes, where he found Grey walking to and fro almost out of breath, so intense were his feelings and so completely absorbed was he in his reflections in regard to the approaching meeting with his son. As Hugo stood looking at him, a door which opened from the parlor into an adjoining bedroom was thrown open, and Mrs. Grattan and her daughter appeared. Mary paused one moment upon the threshold, and then, as her eye fell upon Hugo, she started forward with a glad exclamation of joy, and clung to his neck with the most total disregard to everything but the prompting of her own pure heart.</p>
               <p>Grey looked on, laughing and wiping his eyes by turns, unable to control the emotions which naturally swelled his heart as he witnessed the manifest joy of the young pair at their unexpected union. He was, however, too full to remain a silent spectator long, and walking up to them, he placed a hand upon the head of each, and said, impressively—</p>
               <p>"Let it be ever so, Mary. Let it be ever so, Hugo. No cloud shall ever obscure for a moment your bright path so long as a kind. Providence spares my life. You are each worthy objects of pure, unalloyed affection, and it is my earnest prayer that God may continue the blessings and kindnesses he has shown in bringing us once more together and<pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC6567-00000173"/> in uniting bonds that were considered forever broken. It shall be my joyful task to devote the balance of my life to the happiness of those who have been so miraculously restored to me."</p>
               <p>Hugo, Mary, and Mrs. Grattan involuntarily clustered around the old man as he concluded this sentence; and well they might have thought themselves only parties to a delusive dream, so strange were all the events of the past few days.</p>
               <p>A sharp rap upon the door, and the stereotyped call outside, "Carriage waiting," aroused them from their reflections, and Grey hurried out, joined Sharkey, and, descending to the carriage, both entered and drove off.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Grattan went out to look after the boys, who were already rambling with wondering curiosity through the halls of the building, admiring and examining whatever came in their way, and whose happy voices and exclamations of joy reverberated through the building, no doubt greatly disturbing the nerves of many aristocratic lodgers on the same floor, who wondered how anybody <emph>could</emph> raise their children so rude.</p>
               <p>Even Mrs. Grattan found herself in the midst of things entirely new, and as she walked through the halls with her children, whose boisterous exclamations she kept somewhat in cheek, she saw quite enough to excite <emph>her</emph> wonder almost to as great a pitch as theirs. Servants constantly passing and re-passing, new guests arriving and old ones departing, and all the noise and bustle of a great hotel which surrounded her, was so new to her that she could have asked as many questions as little Elton himself, whose tongue ran incessantly.</p>
               <p>Hugo and Mary had seated themselves in the mean time at a window that overlooked the street, and looking out with their hands clasped together, were talking over matters of interest to themselves alone.</p>
               <p>She was making Grey's promised explanation of all the startling events which had brought them so suddenly to the city, and also about matters of interest at home, the tears starting from his eyes as she alluded, with all the delicacy she could, to the unpleasant situation of his mother and sister, and his father's unrelenting and determined bitterness toward himself.</p>
               <p>"Now," she said, turning toward him a face full of the purest affection, "so far as you are concerned, Hugo, <emph>we</emph> will love you, <emph>we</emph> will appreciate you, and mother and myself will supply as well as is in our power, the place of your kind mother and sweet sister, until a change in your father's feelings shall restore you to them."</p>
               <p>"Mary," Hugo said, pressing her hands warmly between his own and looking fondly at her through his tears, "it is terribly bitter to be so circumstanced, and you will appreciate the feelings of a sensitive mind that has been forced to depend upon strangers <emph>always</emph> for all its happiness. Such has been my bitter lot, Mary, notwithstanding that I have a loving mother and sister at home, surrounded with luxuries and comforts that they never enjoy, and who are as fond of me as I could desire, yet dare not let that fondness exhibit itself."</p>
               <p>Mary replied, earnestly: "You must not give way to such bitter reflections, Hugo; you don't know how I shudder, and how miserable I feel sometimes when I think that your sad experiences may embitter <emph>you,</emph> as my poor father has been embittered. Oh, Hugo," she added, "this would make me miserable indeed!"</p>
               <p>"Thank God!" Hugo cried, warmly, "thank God! Mary, your father is about to be relieved from <emph>his</emph> troubles, and a more deserving man never lived."</p>
               <p>"But," said the girl, "I am afraid that my poor father has suffered so long and so bitterly, that relief comes too late to restore him to us as he was once within my recollection."</p>
               <p>"Well, Mary," Hugo answered, "let us hope for the best; your father's experiences have been truly bitter, to a degree almost insupportable, but he will be now surrounded with all those influences for which he has longed through life; he will be in a condition to gratify his fine taste as well as his benevolence, and above all, Mary, he will be surrounded by warm hearts, whose greatest pleasure will be to gratify his<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC6567-00000174"/> slightest wish. Your father will gradually become himself again; I am sure of it, Mary, but some time may elapse first."</p>
               <p>"You are always a prophet of good, Hugo," Mary said, with something like her wonted happy smile playing about her sweet mouth; "and shall <emph>we</emph> not be thrice happy," she continued, "in laboring <emph>together</emph> through life to brighten the pathway of <emph>our</emph> good old grandfather and <emph>our</emph> father and mother? Would not this compensate, Hugo, for far greater suffering than we have yet endured? And when we are <emph>all</emph> again united, which we <emph>will</emph> be, and these pleasing offices are shared by your father and mother and Louise, what more on earth have we left to wish for?"</p>
               <p>Hugo, carried away by the girl's artless utterance of the promptings of her generous heart, exclaimed: "You are an angel, Mary! Never was there such a girl before! and never was affection so worthily bestowed as mine."</p>
               <p>"I will always be just what I am now, Hugo," Mary answered, with marked emphasis, "and I am certain you will not change."</p>
               <p>In this interchange of youthful feelings (whether they are likely to be realized, those who have had more experience can judge for themselves), these two congenial spirits passed the evening until Grey and Sharkey returned from their visit to Granny Stiles, and while these parties have been thus occupied let us look in upon Grattan for a moment.</p>
               <p>He has returned with Brown from the walk spoken of in a preceding chapter, to his room in the Art-Union building, and the two are seated, conversing upon subjects suggested by this walk.</p>
               <p>"There are a great many good men in the world yet, Mr. Grattan," Brown remarked, in reply to some remarks of the former.</p>
               <p>"Don't misunderstand me, Brown; I have experienced too many never-to-be-forgotten acts of friendship to allow myself to make any sweeping remarks. There are good and glorious men among us, but they are too few to effect anything toward a general encouragement of Art. Neither am I fool enough to look upon <emph>myself</emph> as the only martyr to a false and miserable public sentiment, for there are artists in every city in the Union who suffer as much, and perhaps more, but I can not see the encouragement in the sale of my picture which you seem to think I should. Michael Angelo himself could not live in New York any better than you and I, if he depended upon popular appreciation, and we should have to execute something almost equal to anything <emph>he</emph> ever did before we would be able to compete with present favorites, deserving many, and perhaps all of them, of all they receive. I only speak of it to show you what a slim trust or hope is private patronage in this country. The announcement that Mr. Kensett, Mr. Durand, Mr. Church, or any other acknowledged artist of merit, had received a commission from the 'Duke of Devonshire,' would no doubt call forth a golden shower from the noodles of upper-tendom (many of whom know as much about the merits of a picture as a horse knows about mathematics), and the individual artist thus singled out would no doubt feel immediately the effect of such an announcement in bettered prospects and increasing patronage. At the same time, however, where is the general taste sufficiently discriminating to reward similar and even greater genius (if it should exist), in the cases of forty other poor wretches who are starving?"</p>
               <p>"But, Grattan," interrupted Brown, "won't these things improve in time?"</p>
               <p>"Never! the present system of training to which our youth are subjected ignores sentiment and refinement, and there is no hope of reformation in this respect. The national maxim is, 'Treat every man as if you knew him to be a scoundrel,' in your business transactions; and with this maxim for his guide, the young man is started into the world, educated solely to make money; and the great Author of all things, if it were possible, might exhaust His powers in vain to touch one single feeling of refinement in such a creature. A cataract ten times more magnificent than Niagara might be presented<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC6567-00000175"/> sented for his admiration and wonder, and he would tax his powers to the utmost to invent some plan by which all the water might be used to drive machinery. Show him a volcano a thousand times more sublime and awful than Vesuvius, to awe him, and he would turn his back upon it in disgust, unless he saw some plan by which he could make money out of it. Take him even to the 'New Jerusalem,' and if, as we are told, the city is built of gold and precious stones, 'all the spirits of the just made perfect' would have to 'mount guard' to prevent its utter demolition. Such is the effect of the practical teachings of our time; and you may smile, Brown, but I tell you these are terrible truths.</p>
               <p>"I do not smile at the matter, Grattan, but at the manner of illustrating your position. But what can artists do but endure, if things are so hopeless?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing (unless they can convert themselves into machines) but hang themselves, or continue to starve, which we can both testify, has little poetry in it. The world is all artificiality; there is nothing real in it. Our social relations are artificial; our business ideas are artificial; we are artificial ourselves; our children are artificial; our religion is artificial; preachers preach to it, lawyers plead to it, doctors physic it, politicians pander to it; and the real—the affections, the noble impulses of our humanity, the yearnings of our souls for something above the dollar—must be galvanized with artificialities. The pure coin will not pass current, and he who offers it will be treated as a counterfeiter."</p>
               <p>"Why, Grattan, I saw a statement in a city paper only a few days ago, that American artists were better patronized and got better prices than any artists in the world. I thought it rather a curious statement, but did not know but it might be true."</p>
               <p>"A falsehood, every word of it! but allowing it to <emph>be</emph> true, it only proves that artists who are not American—or, in other words, European artists—are more poverty-stricken than ours—that's all. Ask the artists themselves how well they are patronized, and see what the response will be! Ask yourself self, Brown, who have talent to accomplish as much in your branch as Elliott or Page. You get sometimes ten, oftener five, dollars for a head beautifully painted, full of artistic promise, and Adolph Rembrandt Tucker receives from a <emph>discriminating public</emph> from sixty to a hundred dollars apiece for heads that should disgrace a sign-painter."</p>
               <p>"But, Grattan, these things have always been so; you are too severe!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Brown, artists have always been looked upon as unfortunate individuals, placed here for some inscrutable purpose, which no one tries or cares to fathom, and destined to go hungry through the world. This is the penalty visited inevitably upon those elements which constitute the artist, and we have no right to expect that things should be any better in this enlightened nineteenth century, about which we boast so much. This is a crushing argument!"</p>
               <p>"Don't get angry with me, Mr. Grattan, but indeed your conversation makes me miserable."</p>
               <p>"Well, Brown, according to your own argument, you ought to be miserable—'things have always been so.' Artists have <emph>always</emph> been miserable; <emph>you</emph> have no business to be otherwise. <emph>You</emph> have no mission to perform. Sages and philosophers for centuries have been trying to solve the problem what artists <emph>were</emph> made for. But it has been reserved for this year of our Lord to settle the question; it is no longer a matter of doubt. They were born to starve, and those who starve the longest and suffer the most in every way are expected to succeed the best. No, Brown; go hire yourselves to some machinist for sixpence a day to turn a grindstone, and I will go into some saloon to churn ice-cream for a like sum, and we shall soon be called '<emph>useful citizens.</emph>' Or, if you like that better, go to gambling or picking pockets; so that you make money, it will all be the same."</p>
               <p>As Grattan concluded this sentence, glaring wildly at him, and talking loudly and vehemently, poor Brown looked quite frightened; and, indeed, the hollow eye and sunken cheek of<pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC6567-00000176"/> the speaker, coupled with these, might well disturb his nerves. Still he ventured to remark, mildly, that he could but hope that things would yet grow better. "I can not talk with <emph>you,</emph> Mr. Grattan; I feel the truth of much that you say, but if I hoped as little as you seem to, I should die in less than six months. What <emph>do</emph> you find out of which to get any happiness?"</p>
               <p>"The prospect of dying before long, Brown; this is an uncommon source of happiness, is it not?"</p>
               <p>Brown made no answer, but shaking like an aspen-leaf, left Grattan alone, thinking all the way as he walked back to his own room, that he was in a dangerous mood, and asking himself whether he ought not to consult with some one about poor Grattan's case. As soon as he got home he went up to Byrnie's room, and hurriedly told him of the conversation he had just had with Grattan, and asked him what he thought of it.</p>
               <p>"Think of it!" Byrnie exclaimed, "why, first, I think that he will some day kill himself in one of these melancholy fits; and secondly, that he ought to kill himself; and thirdly, if I can find a rope, I'll carry it down to him in the morning. But, seriously, Brown, it is sad for poor Grattan; you and I can get along very well; it is only our own backs and stomachs that growl if they are not cared for; but it is not so with him. However, I have reasons to believe that things will be better with him soon."</p>
               <p>"Byrnie!" cried Brown, "if you have anything upon which to ground such a hope, for Heaven's sake go down and tell him so. I tell you, I never saw any one look so fierce as he did when I left him."</p>
               <p>"He always looks fierce when he is excited or animated in conversation; and he has indulged this frame of mind for so many years that it would be a good speculation to employ him to work at the vinegar business. I am not at liberty to tell him anything, but I will go with you to see him, and try to get him upon some pleasant topic and enliven his spirits. He'll have the nightmare," he added, with a laugh, "if he goes to bed in this kind of mood."</p>
               <p>Thus agreed, the two friends went to Grattan's room, and did not return until late at night. What happened there I can not tell; but when they parted on the landing of the stairs, Byrnie turned to Brown, and said, "It is no more than I expected, Brown, but for God's sake never mention a word of it to a living soul; his wife and family are in town."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXII.</head>
               <head type="sub">INTERVIEW WITH GRANNY STILES—THE PRECIOUS RELICS RECOVERED—THEY ARE DISCUSSED AT THE ASTOR HOUSE.</head>
               <p>"IT does seem to me, Duncan, that these horses are very slow," said Grey to Sharkey, as they rode rapidly through street after street, "or it is an immense distance."</p>
               <p>"We can not be far from the place now," Sharkey replied, in a faint voice, looking out of the window; "we are in the vicinity, if my recollection serves me." As he said so, he fell heavily back in the carriage again and remained silent, but Grey every moment started forward and looked nervously out of the window. Suddenly the carriage pulled up opposite a very narrow street, and the driver called out—</p>
               <p>"Is this the place, down this dark hole?"</p>
               <p>Grey and Sharkey both looked out, and the latter answered: "Yes; drive in till you come to the first little alley on the right, and stop."</p>
               <p>"This is a devil of a place to bring a respectable carriage to," the man grumbled, cracking his whip to give emphasis to this expression of his anger.</p>
               <p>Grey merely remarked to him in reply that they expected to pay him well for his services; and the carriage entering the dark little street through which we followed Grattan but a few evenings before, a short distance brought them to the entrance of the dark passage, and Grey and Sharkey getting out, the former bade the driver wait there until they returned; and the two hurried into this narrow alley, now so dark that nothing could be seen except by the very little light which could struggle through the dirty window of Granny Stiles' underground apartment. This was sufficient, however, to direct Sharkey, who now led the way toward the low door we have elsewhere spoken of.</p>
               <p>Arrived here, he rapped loudly, and it was some time before any movement was heard within. Just, however, as he was about to repeat the rap, an inner door opened and shut, and the light of a candle glimmered through the cracks of the one where they stood. In another moment a voice asked—</p>
               <p>"Is that you, Jimmy?"</p>
               <p>"No, Granny Stiles—no, it is I," Sharkey answered.</p>
               <p>"Well, I declare! Who is <emph>I?</emph>" the old woman asked again.</p>
               <p>"Sharkey," he answered. "Sharkey—don't you recollect Sharkey?"</p>
               <p>"Ah! ha!" she exclaimed, with a disgusting chuckle, and evidently in anticipation of some new demand upon her which would be liberally paid for, at the same time undoing the door; "ah! ha! you did come again, didn't you, Mr. Sharkey?" Then starting suddenly back, as her eye fell on Grey, she added, partly closing the door, "Who is this, Mr. Sharkey? No Billy, I hope. You won't get anything out of me that way, I can tell you."</p>
               <p>"No, no, Granny Stiles; this is only a gentleman who comes with me to make some inquiries of you about matters you and I talked of before."</p>
               <p>"Well, come in," she said; and closing the door after them she led the way to the inner apartment, which we have visited before, and setting a couple of rickety chairs for the gentlemen, she drew herself partly upon the old table in a kind of half-sitting posture, and waited very composedly for them to begin, determined to gain all the advantage there was to be gained by silence on her part.</p>
               <p>"Granny Stiles," Grey at length began (using her familiar title), "I have come to ask you to deliver to me certain articles<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC6567-00000178"/> cles which were placed in your hands by a dying woman long years ago, to be given by you to her son, who survived her—a request on her part which you never gratified."</p>
               <p>This sentence from the venerable old man, delivered in a tremulous voice, at first somewhat embarrassed her; but recovering her composure, with a long sigh she answered:</p>
               <p>"Well, raally, sir, I should like to know who you are; you ask for things as ef you had a purfect right."</p>
               <p>"I have a perfect right," Grey replied, "as you will soon learn."</p>
               <p>"Well, raally," the old woman repeated again; "'spose you let a body <emph>know</emph> who you are."</p>
               <p>"I am, Granny Stiles, the husband of that woman who died beneath your roof, and the father of that boy from whom you have so long and cruelly kept the only clew by which he could hope to be restored to his friends."</p>
               <p>"I declare, old gentleman," she answered, snappishly, "this is a pretty idea; do you 'spose I was goin' to let them things go out of my hands for nothing, after all the trouble of raisin' the boy? Her husband, ha!" she continued, after a pause, and advancing the candle toward Grey's face—"and the boy's father—very likely—what might your name be?"</p>
               <p>"Hewson."</p>
               <p>"Well, now!" she said, turning to Sharkey, "that does sound like it; but you know I told you I never could make out what she called herself; what with the drowndin' in the breakers, and the cold and fright, she never seemed to be in her right mind; but, raally, that <emph>does</emph> sound like it. Well?" she continued, interrogatively, turning to Grey.</p>
               <p>"Well, Granny Stiles," he went on, now almost too much affected to speak at all, "I understand plainly that these precious relics which have so long been withheld from my poor boy, must be purchased if they are ever restored. What do you ask for hem?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly," the old woman replied, thoroughly excited, and leaning forward toward him, clutching her fingers together unconsciously, as if grasping the treasure which she saw in her imagination—"certainly <emph>you</emph> know what it is worth to you better'n I do."</p>
               <p>"I prefer that you should name your own price; it is a species of dealing that I never engaged in before."</p>
               <p>"Well," said the old woman, pausing between her words, "what do you say to—to—say to—three hundred dollars?"</p>
               <p>Grey waited not for another word, but thrust his hands in his pockets, and drawing thence a large pocket-book, commenced opening it, when the old woman started up, and putting her hand on his arm, cried out:</p>
               <p>"Hold a minit, mister! Let's see—I forgot. I don't think that's enough; see, there's the picter—yes, two picters; and the baby's fixins'—yes, and her own fixins'—and the—"</p>
               <p>"No matter how much or how little there is, Grey replied, angrily; "name your price and abide by it."</p>
               <p>"Well, you see I was making a kind of a little inventory of the things to refresh my mind. Ah, yes," she said, looking eagerly at the well-filled pocket-book. "What do you say to five hundred, sir?"</p>
               <p>Grey again opened the pocket-book, and had commenced counting out the bills, when she interrupted him the second time.</p>
               <p>"There! I know'd I'd forget something! there's the little box, with all sorts of gimcracks in it, and her shawl, which, to be sure, Anne has worn occasionally, but it is about as good as new for all."</p>
               <p>"Well," said Grey, his anger rising, "what does all this lead to?"</p>
               <p>"Nothin', mister," she answered, "nothin' particular, only I was thinkin' five hundred was too little." As she said this, she looked gloatingly at the roll of bills in Grey's hand.</p>
               <p>"Granny Stiles," said Grey, finally, "bring these things here, put them into the hands of Mr. Sharkey, then name your price, or I will leave without them, and call again with a policeman and take them from you by force, and give you <emph>nothing</emph> for them."</p>
               <p>"I can destroy the hull kit before the p'lice can get here,"<pb n="356-357" xml:id="VAC6567-00000179"/> she answered with a grim smile, and looking all the time at Grey keenly. "No, no, squire, that won't do. I'll bring the things out and give them to Sharkey for the six hundred dollars. Will that satisfy you?"</p>
               <p>"Bring them out," the old man answered, while the perspiration stood in large drops upon his forehead.</p>
               <p>As Grey acceded to her proposition for the third time, she reluctantly got up from her seat, and going to the old bed we have spoken of, pulled from beneath it a large old walnut chest, which looked as if it might have been used by the Pilgrims, and diving into her capacious pocket, drew forth an enormous key, and unlocking it, raised the lid. Sharkey advanced to her to take the things as they were handed out, and Grey busied himself counting the money at the table. The old woman, before she proceeded further, looked around at Grey, as if doubtful whether he would "live up to his bargain;" and seeing him actually counting out the money, this seemed to satisfy her, and she commenced handing forth to Sharkey the articles she had named. First came forth from the mysterious depths of this time-worn receptacle a beautiful dressing-case of ebony, inlaid with pearl, with a beautifully-wrought handle of silver. As she handed it to Sharkey, she remarked: "The key to <emph>that</emph> was lost somehow, and we were <emph>obleeged</emph> to break it open to see what was inside." Next came two beautiful velvet miniature-cases, with gold clasps, and after this followed some small articles of jewelry, some child's dresses, and portions of a lady's wardrobe; and after fumbling about some time longer, the old woman shut down the lid, saying: "That's all, except the shawl, and Anne wore that out agin this evenin'. I guess she'll be back, though, presently—'praps before you go."</p>
               <p>Not wishing to subject Mr. Grey to any unnecessary display of emotion here, Sharkey had tied everything up in a large handkerchief, and now announced to him that he was ready to return.</p>
               <p>The old man pushed the money across the table to Granny Stiles, and they were obliged to sit for another half hour while she counted the money over, tediously and carefully, to satisfy herself that all was right.</p>
               <p>Satisfied at length that no effort had been made to cheat her, she rolled up the bills and put them into her pocket, with a grin of satisfaction; and as Grey and Sharkey were about to depart, she took Grey by the arm again, and said, familiarly; "Now, old chap, before you go, I can tell you something else, if you wish to know it and are willing to <emph>trot up.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"What is that?" Grey asked, turning upon her with a look of intense curiosity.</p>
               <p>"I can tell you," she said, drawing him near her and speaking in a low voice—"I can tell you where your son is."</p>
               <p>"Thank you," said Grey, "I can find him without your assistance. And bidding her good-night, they returned to the carriage, where they found the driver swearing heartily at their delay; and when they got in, he mounted his box, and as if determined to make up for lost time, he laid whip to his horses, and they flew through the streets at such a speed that in much less time than it had taken to reach the door of Granny Stiles, they were landed again at their hotel.</p>
               <p>We have only to add, in concluding this scene, that some excitement was created in the city by the announcement next morning that an old woman, who resided in an obscure part of the city, had been found murdered in a most shocking manner, and her miserable abode rifled of everything that was of the least value. Investigation proved it to have been Granny Stiles, and the murder was attributed to her own daughter and a low villain who was a constant companion of hers, both of whom had disappeared and had not yet been arrested.</p>
               <p>The articles recovered from Granny Stiles were taken to Grey's room, and in council with Hugo, Mrs. Grattan, and Mary, it was determined that no visit should be made to Grattan until morning, it being now already ten o'clock. Sharkey retired, very much depressed, to his own room, and seemed purposely to avoid the happy little group collected in<pb n="358-359" xml:id="VAC6567-00000180"/> the parlor. Grey related to them the adventures of the evening, and as his deeply interested auditors were exceedingly anxious to see the precious relics, to recover which he had taken so much pains, he brought the bundle from his room, and placing it upon a table, the door was carefully closed, and the party gathered around it in silence; while the old man, with feelings which were difficult to command, proceeded to open it and exhibit articles which were familiar to him, and which he had recollected as if every circumstance connected with their purchase and presentation to his long-lost wife had occurred but yesterday. To those, however, who looked on, perhaps no less deeply interested, they were but the sacred mementoes left by one never seen, but whose painful story and terrible death moved every heart in the group. Each article, as it was brought forth, increased Grey's excitement, and his grief was neither interrupted by remark nor question. He handed the articles of clothing to Mrs. Grattan, and with a voice husky and tremulous, holding up a dress once worn by his wife, said:</p>
               <p>"Kate, you must keep this for me sacredly; this is the very dress that she wore the last time I saw her. Poor Margaret!" he added, bowing his head forward; "little did we then think that we were never to meet again. But, on the contrary, what bright pictures we were painting of a happy future, when, once again united here, we should live happily together, with none to fear or avoid!"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Grattan took the articles, and carefully rolling them up, put them away in her own room and returned to where Grey was now sitting, bowed forward, indulging without restraint the grief engendered by the sight of articles every one of which was connected in his memory with some pleasant moment enjoyed with her whose image had been cherished faithfully for long, long sorrowful years, and whose terrible sufferings were now more vividly impressed upon him since his visit to old Granny Stiles, in whose hut, upon the seashore, his poor wife could have been treated in her last moments with but very little tenderness. And when he reflected what must have been the early training of his son, surrounded by the coarse and vulgar associates of this heartless old wretch, he fervently thanked God that in spite of every opposing influence; in spite of the degrading associations of his early years; in spite of the rude rebuffs of the sordid world, he had yet been preserved to him with noble aspirations, honest impulses, ripe intellect, and an affectionate nature; and his joy and thankfulness were excited that he had not found in him the opposite of all these characteristics. "He could never have been saved," the old man said, giving voice to his thoughts, "except through the influence of those very tastes which the heartless world has all his life been trying to crush out. Without these he would have been little better than a bear or wolf; his early associations must have ruined him."</p>
               <p>"Who do you speak of, father?" said Mrs. Grattan, kindly, and placing her hand affectionately upon his shoulder.</p>
               <p>"Look here, Kate!" he answered, holding out the miniature so that all could see it. "Here is my poor Louis, as I saw him in his mother's arms on the morning of our parting. Those little arms were tenderly and lovingly circling my neck, and his rosy cheeks pressed against mine in an embrace which I fondly hoped would be repeated before many months passed by, under happier circumstances. This, Kate, is your husband, and Mary's father, as his bright smile last greeted his sorrow-stricken father. And here," he continued, taking from his pocket another case precisely like those recovered from Granny Stiles, "here, Kate, is the sweet face of the mother, whose image has not only rested <emph>upon</emph> my heart, but has dwelt <emph>in</emph> it from that moment to this." Not a dry eye looked upon the grief-stricken old man as he proceeded; and when he had concluded and bent forward again, overcome by these sad recollections, his auditors knelt around him and bent their heads in sympathetic sorrow—truthful sorrow, my dear, practical reader; the sorrow that flows from refined minds, which alone are capable of feeling it, and not the stereotyped article manufactured to order among dollar worshipers<pb n="360-361" xml:id="VAC6567-00000181"/> shipers. The grief of old Grey was sincerely and honestly reflected from the hearts of those who witnessed it.</p>
               <p>Somewhat calmed by giving vent to his feelings, he now took the little cabinet we have mentioned, and opened it to examine its contents, more self-possessed than he had been during any portion of this scene. This had evidently contained valuables, and Grey informed those who stood around him that his wife had kept in this box many articles of jewelry which had been presented to her from time to time, but none of these remained, and with the exception of some minor articles of needlework, there was nothing left of interest.</p>
               <p>Grey kept working about with his fingers in the inside of the box—first in one place and then in another—until at length by pressing in the bottom of one of the compartments on one side of the box, a concealed drawer underneath was thrust out, and curiosity was once more aroused to know its contents.</p>
               <p>"Ah!" he cried, taking out something rolled up very carefully in a piece of paper, "I knew there was a secret drawer somewhere here; what is this?" And proceeding to unroll the paper, he brought to light two bills of exchange on the Bank of England for one hundred pounds each. "This is astonishing! How could these have escaped that old hag's search? Her love of money, one would suppose, would have enabled her to find this by intuition. These are bills of exchange, Kate," he continued, turning to Mrs. Grattan, "I gave to my poor wife, over and above other means which were intended for her incidental expenses, and which has no doubt been long since appropriated by Granny Stiles. And what a reflection it is, my daughter, that your excellent husband has suffered such wrong and injustice through life, when this little box, which was withheld from him by the grasping penuriousness of this old hag, contained enough to have placed him in a position where his talent could have been made available! Here, my dear daughter," he added, handing the bills to Mrs. Grattan, "take them now and use them as your kind heart may dictate; they are as good now as then, and should in justice have been yours long ago."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Grattan took the bills mechanically, deeply impressed by Grey's apparent determination to make amends to them for all their misfortunes by the most lavish generosity; and after a moment's pause, she said: "Father, I shall never know how to dispose of so much money; the very contemplation of the amount, the knowledge that I have so much, will embarrass me very much, and I shall never know what to do with it."</p>
               <p>"Keep it, Kate! you shall be much more familiar with money hereafter than you ever have been, and I have not the least doubt your generous heart will prompt you to make the very best use of it. Now," he said, "as we are all very tired, and as I have a duty to perform in the morning which will require all my nerve, you must bid me good-night, and let me go to my bed."</p>
               <p>Mary and her mother embraced him affectionately, and imprinted each a warm kiss upon his fine, open brow, and he got up and said to Hugo: "My boy, you must be here early in the morning, as I will need you to guide me to my son's room. I shall not be very patient if you keep me waiting long."</p>
               <p>"I will be here in good season, sir," Hugo replied, "for I perfectly appreciate your feelings."</p>
               <p>"Good-night, then, good-night," the old man answered, and retired to his room. Hugo took his leave soon after, and the mother and daughter retired to their room, also to rest and prepare themselves for the joyful meeting on the morrow.</p>

               <head type="sub">GRATTAN AT HIS MORNING MEAL—HE RECEIVES UNEXPECTED VISITORS—GREY REVEALS HIMSELF—SCENE ON MEETING WITH HIS FAMILY AND SHARKEY.</head>
               <p>WE will now return to Mr. Grattan. It is on the morning after his conversation with Brown. He has just seated himself at a little table in the middle of his room to partake of his morning meal, to which he had been able, by his recent good luck, to add a little molasses and a very small quantity of butter. Behold him, reader, the worthy and talented candidate for artistic honors, making his solitary morning meal on such fare, for want of the ability to procure better, even in a season of comparative good luck. As Grattan sat thus munching his dry breakfast, the expression of his countenance was hopelessly melancholy, almost desperate. Though there was at the moment a slight improvement in his condition and prospects in consequence of the sale of his picture, he knew too well that months might elapse before he sold another; and what were his family to do in the mean time? Were they to continue to live upon the charity of his friends? At this thought he brought his clenched fist hard upon the little table, and was about to utter some bitter exclamation, when a short rap at the door aroused him, and he started to his feet and hastened to open it, not expecting any one to call upon him except Byrnie, Brown, or Hugo, and therefore not taking any pains to remove the remains of his wretched breakfast. How was he astonished, then, when on opening the door he saw Hugo in company with a well-dressed, gentlemanly old man whom he did not recognize! and how natural it was that the thought of the exhibition of his straitened circumstances to strangers should fill him with mortification.</p>
               <p>"Why," said Hugo, as they stood facing each other at the door—"why, Mr. Grattan, don't you know Mr. Grey—Father Grey?"</p>
               <p>"Grey!" Grattan exclaimed, joyfully, now for the first time beginning to see some faint remains of his former self. "Is it possible? but you have changed your appearance so much that it is not surprising that I should not at first have recognized you, particularly when I little thought of seeing you here. Well," he said (and smiling at the same time sarcastically), "I was just feeling very much mortified that a stranger was about to catch me at my breakfast. But <emph>you,</emph> Father Grey," he said, "will take it as no insult if I ask you to partake of such as I have."</p>
               <p>Grey took one look at the table, and turning his head away, as if attracted by the unfinished picture which sat upon an easel near him, remarked, in a faltering voice, that he had already eaten breakfast. His handkerchief was frequently applied to his eyes, in the mean time, before he turned and took the seat which Grattan had proffered him.</p>
               <p>Then Grattan sat down in front of him, and with a flushed and excited countenance, asked—</p>
               <p>"Mr. Grey, how is Kate, and Mary, and the children? Did you see them before you left? Did they send me no message?"</p>
               <p>Hugo, unable to control his feelings, and knowing well what was to follow, walked into the little bedroom adjoining, and closed the door. Grey then answered Grattan with a manner more excited than his own, if possible—</p>
               <p>"Your family are all well and happy as they can be under the circumstances; but they sent no other message than their assurance of undying affection."</p>
               <p>"Could they not have written me, at least, a few words?" Grattan asked, bitterly. "It has been two long weeks since I have heard from them; and this," he added, pointing to the<pb n="364-365" xml:id="VAC6567-00000183"/> remains of his meal, "to a man circumstanced as I am, is an eternity."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Grattan," said Grey, evading his questions, and speaking with an effort, "it was unfortunate that you were married so young; how did this happen?"</p>
               <p>"Unfortunate!" Grattan exclaimed, looking at him with astonishment, "it was the very step that preserved me from reckless indifference. How did it happen? Grey, imagine yourself turned loose upon the world alone, without father or mother, not knowing even who these were, and in your wandering and longing for something to love—something to love you—you find this ideal being, and she proves all 'that fancy painted her,' would you not marry? And would you be likely to act from the dictates of either caution or prudence?"</p>
               <p>Grey turned away his head and looked into the street, while Grattan proceeded—</p>
               <p>"Such was my case, Mr. Grey; and had it not been for the villainous machinations of that heartless scoundrel—that Sharkey—it would not have been so bad with us. But tell me, Grey," he said, starting forward and touching the old man on the shoulder, while his eyes blazed fiercely with excitement, "what does this mean? A few days ago I was shown a letter by an old hag in the city—who was with my mother in her last moments, and who kept me until I was old enough to run away from her—purporting to come from Sharkey, and written within a few weeks. What does it mean, Grey? My wife, too, has written me that Sharkey <emph>may not</emph> be dead; and Hugo tells me that from some things which came to his knowledge under circumstances which bind him to secrecy, he does not believe him dead. What do these things mean, Mr. Grey?" he continued, wildly; "do you know anything about it?"</p>
               <p>Grey remained with his face turned from him, but his nervousness could not be concealed from Grattan even by this effort to do so, and with his eyes fixed inquiringly upon him, the latter continued, pleadingly—</p>
               <p>"Oh, Grey! if you know anything about this matter; if you can do or say anything which will relieve me of these transitions from hope to fear—this terrible struggle—one moment with the idea that I have taken the life of a fellow-creature, and the next with heart beating high with hope that he has by some mysterious circumstance been saved—if you can relieve me from such a frame of mind, Grey, I don't care what may be your motive for concealment, it is your duty to do so. Indeed, I shall go mad before long, without the addition of this horrible reflection to hasten such a crisis. Misery and starvation, almost, are the familiar acquaintances of the artist, and these alone are sufficient to try his powers of endurance to the utmost."</p>
               <p>"Are your prospects not mending?" said Grey, in a hollow voice. "Do you not look forward to a better state of things?"</p>
               <p>"Ah, Grey," Grattan replied, "this will not do; you try to evade the subject; there must be something in Granny Stiles' story; you can tell me all that I wish to know. So help me God, Grey!" he continued, in tones which trembled with intense feeling, "so far from things being any better, my patronage since I came here has not amounted to anything worth naming, and I will not live to endure such torture; I am fitted for no other occupation; there is no hope in this; and let the consequences be what they may, I will not endure it. I will rid myself of an existence which is intolerable to me, and a curse to those who are dependent upon me. Now, if you can not unravel this mystery so that I can satisfy my wife that I am no murderer, and can meet my children without feeling self-condemned, I have nothing to live for; life has no attractions for me. I am sick of it, and will end it!" As he uttered these last words in a tone that evinced his sincerity, he bowed his head upon the table and seemed utterly unable to speak or raise himself.</p>
               <p>He remained in this position some time, and did not see the tears which Grey frequently wiped from his eyes, or notice his excessive agitation. Unable any longer to conceal his<pb n="366-367" xml:id="VAC6567-00000184"/> feelings, Grey walked to the little bedroom and spoke a few words to Hugo, who passed through the room where Grattan still sat, bowed upon the table, and went out. Grey then returned to him, and placing his hands kindly upon his shoulder, said—</p>
               <p>"Grattan, look up! I have something important to say to you." Grattan slowly raised his head, and looked the old man in the eye with an expression of deepest melancholy.</p>
               <p>"I am about to lift you out of your misery, and introduce you to a state so entirely different from the one you so much complain of, that I shall never expect to hear such fearful language from you again. What you are about to learn will require all your nerve to listen to, and all of mine to relate, and what you will <emph>see</emph> will astonish you still more."</p>
               <p>During the delivery of these words Grattan has risen to his feet, and now stood staring at the old man in breathless astonishment.</p>
               <p>"You are about to learn," he continued, "who your mother was, who Sharkey is, and who your father is."</p>
               <p>"Is? who my father <emph>is,</emph> Mr. Grey! Is my father living, then?" Grattan eargerly inquired, while the look of astonishment and bewilderment which he cast upon Grey almost prevented the old man from replying.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Grattan, your father is living—Sharkey is living—and your wife and daughter will be here with him, in this room, in a few minutes, to rejoice with you in being restored to his arms."</p>
               <p>"Are <emph>you</emph> my father?" said Grattan, his eyes fixed inquiringly upon his face, and scarcely able to keep his limbs under him—"are you my father, Mr. Grey?"</p>
               <p>"Yes!" said Grey, now bursting forth into an uncontrollable flood of tears and extending his arms—"yes, Louis, <emph>I</emph> am your father!"</p>
               <p>The words had not died upon the old man's lips before the two were locked in an affectionate embrace, and neither of them were able to speak as Hugo entered the room, followed by Mrs. Grattan, Mary, and Sharkey.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Grattan and Mary ran forward to where Grey and Grattan stood, and clung weeping to the latter, while Sharkey and Hugo turned their backs upon the scene, unable to witness such an exhibition of frantic joy. Frantic it was, for Grattan, when he heard the voice of his wife and daughter, raised his eyes and looked about him like one bereft of reason; and when his eyes fell upon Sharkey, he broke from those who were clinging to him, and walking up to him, seized him by the collar, and dragging him toward the middle of the room, exclaimed, in a voice of fury:</p>
               <p>"Now, villain! tell me why you have reduced me and mine to such a state of humiliating dependence, before I strangle you. Tell me why you have thought fit to keep me under the impression that my hand had cut short your existence! Tell me why you robbed me and my family of the means of subsistence, before I do that which the fear of having already done has almost driven me mad!"</p>
               <p>During this exhibition of passion, Grey, Hugo, and Mrs. Grattan were in vain trying to loosen Sharkey from his grasp. He still clung to him with a grip of iron, his face purple with rage, and his eyes flashing like a maniac's; but their united efforts finally succeeded in releasing Sharkey from his grasp, and Grattan permitted himself to be led back again to the table, where he threw himself upon a chair and wept long and convulsively, his wife affectionately supporting his head, and Mary kneeling upon the floor by his side, wringing her hands in an agony of grief at her father's condition.</p>
               <p>For many minutes not a word was said, but all eyes were anxiously bent upon poor Grattan with the most affectionate interest. Sharkey had fallen into a chair, where his own self-accusations had entirely mastered him, and the sight of the wretchedness which had been entailed upon Grattan by his heartless persecution filled him with shame and repentance. Hugo had leaned against the wall at a short distance, and was sobbing aloud, and Grey, with his arms folded, and the drops slowly gathering in his eyes, stood looking upon his<pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC6567-00000185"/> son with a gaze in which was concentrated a world of affection, and with which was mingled an expression of alarm at his situation.</p>
               <p>To his surprise, however, Grattan in a few minutes raised his head, and extending his hand to him, said, in a voice comparatively calm: "Father! if this be true—if I <emph>am</emph> your son—I can hear no more now; let me be taken where I can rest and recover myself. Sharkey!" he cried, calling to him, "forgive me; I was wild; I did not know what I was doing. Oh, Kate!" he continued, to his wife, "my head will burst!"</p>
               <p>Grey, in great alarm at this strange conduct, hurried Hugo out after a carriage, and as soon as Grattan could be got into it, he was immediately transferred to their hotel, where he was put to bed and received the constant and unremitting attentions of those who were so unexpectedly restored to him. In a half-conscious frame of mind he revolved all that he had heard and seen in his room, until he began to have a tolerably clear idea of his position and a better understanding of events which had appeared so mysterious and unaccountable. The vail began to rise, and although no explanation had yet been made to him, he thought he could penetrate, at least partially, the motives of Grey in keeping all his plans and movements a secret. But there were many things yet too much complicated and confused for him to attempt to understand them. Who was Grey? who was Sharkey? what had Sharkey to do with him? what motive had he in harassing him as he had done? and, above all, how had Grey ever been able to trace up events so as to bring about such an unheard of result, himself always unsuspected? These were questions which still puzzled and embarrassed him, and which he longed to have answered. At length, wearied and overcome by these questions, he threw himself, with a deep sigh, back upon the pillow, and closing his eyes, like one in a fit of intoxication, went into a deep sleep, which lasted many hours; but as his senses were being lulled into forgetfulness, a vision passed through his brain of an old man bending anxiously and affectionately over him, and dropping a tear upon his pillow. Was it Grey? A soft hand parted the hair from his brow, and a warm kiss burned upon his cheek. Was it his wife? The goddess of sleep shut out the vision, whether a reality or a dream he could not tell.</p>

               <head type="sub">INTERVIEWS AT THE ASTOR HOUSE—GRATTAN SUDDENLY BLESSED WITH LOTS OF FRIENDS—HUGO AND MARY—BYRNIE.</head>
               <p>THE dinner hour had passed, and Grey and the family of Grattan had returned to their quarters, after having been made the objects of many a curious gaze. As they passed through the long hall which led from the dining-room, the marked attention they received, and the very profound bows which greeted them at every turn, astonished Mrs. Grattan and Mary very much; and when they reached their own private room again, Mary was curious to know why people bowed to them so much <emph>just that day.</emph> "Every one I meet," she said, "seems to have discovered something particularly attractive about me."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Elton, "and me, too, grandfather. One gentleman took me on his knee and trotted me a long time. He asked me if my father was an artist, and said I was a brave boy. I know he's the same man that came out of his room yesterday when Edgar and myself were playing in the hall, and took me by the arm and shook me and swore at me. I know he's the same man."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Edgar, who did not wish to have it seem that he had been neglected, "and a <emph>nice</emph> gentleman took me by the hand, when you and grandfather and Mary were out this morning, and led me away down the street somewhere, and took me into a <emph>grocery</emph> and gave me an armful of candies—didn't he, Elton?"</p>
               <p>Grey laughed heartily at these stories. "Now, if you will all sit down," he said, "I will explain this wonderful conduct to your satisfaction." And taking a morning paper out of his pocket, he read with all the gravity he could assume, the following:</p>
               <q>
                  <floatingText>

                           <head>"EXTRAORDINARY GOOD LUCK TO AN ARTIST.</head>
                           <p>"We are informed than an artist for some time a resident in this city, has fallen heir to an immense estate in England; that he was discovered in this city by his father, who has been in this country some years in search of him; and that the whole party are now guests at the Astor House. We have learned the names of none of the parties, but it is said that the circumstances connected with the loss of this son, and his final recovery by his father, would make a tale stranger than fiction."</p>
                        </div>
                     </body>
                  </floatingText>
               </q>
               <p>While the little group were looking at each other in astonishment at what they heard, a rap came at the door, and upon opening it, one of the servants of the hotel handed Grey a card, and stood waiting while he read it. It was as follows: <q>
                     <p>"Hon. Peter Cognovit's respects to Mr. Grattan. Can he see him for a few moments in the public parlor?"</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"Tell the gentleman," said Grey, "that my son is at present unwell, and will not be able to see his friends before tomorrow."</p>
               <p>Before he could close the door, another servant ran up with the cards of Theophilus Gamble, Esq.; James Grabb, banker, Wall Street; Carter Dodge, Esq., and many other aristocratic names known to upper-tendom, to all of whom Grey returned the same answer, couched in respectful terms. As he closed the door and returned to the table, he remarked, throwing the cards of these distinguished individuals to Mrs. Grattan:</p>
               <p>"I wonder who these people can be—perhaps some of my son's friends, come to congratulate him upon having been restored to his poor old father. Certainly it is very kind of them, indeed. Keep the cards, Kate; no doubt Louis will be glad to see them when he feels better."</p>
               <p>The door of the little bedroom opened as he spoke, and Mr. Grattan appeared before them, with a bewildered expression<pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC6567-00000187"/> sion on his face, which suddenly cleared up when he saw the little group of familiar faces turned toward him.</p>
               <p>"It is not a dream, then," he cried, joyfully; "you <emph>are</emph> all here. I awoke and found myself in a strange place, and it seemed to me that there must be some truth in the vision which haunted my mind, and I came forth to satisfy myself whether it was a dream, or whether you were all here with me!"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Grattan had risen and hurried to his side, and as he repeated these words, she led him forward and seated him among his children, who hung around him with glad faces, each trying to attract his notice. "It is no dream, Kate, is it?" he said, turning to his wife—"and you," he said to Grey, "<emph>are</emph> my father? tell me <emph>how</emph> you are my father."</p>
               <p>"My dear son," said Grey, "if you think you can hear all the circumstances connected with this matter without exciting you too much, I will tell you at once."</p>
               <p>"I can hear it all," Grattan answered, "and you do not know how anxious I am to have every fear that this may be a mistake or a delusion, removed, so that I shall have no more even a doubt that I <emph>have</emph> a father living, and that he has been restored to me."</p>
               <p>Grey seated himself by his side, holding his hand affectionately in his own, and gave a minute account of all the facts the reader is acquainted with, and Grattan sat listening with varied emotions until the whole was concluded, never for a moment moving his eyes from his father's face until he had finished.</p>
               <p>Then taking both the old man's hands in his own, he said, with moistened eyes, but with a firm voice—</p>
               <p>"Father, may I prove myself worthy of the affection you have exhibited for me, in your efforts to trace me out, and may God grant that my bitter experiences shall not have soured me so much toward the whole race as to render this joyful union of no avail in making me finally a happy man."</p>
               <p>"My son," said Grey, "think no more of these bitter things, but rather let your mind find employment in acts of benevolence and kindness. You shall have abundant means not only for this, but for the gratification of your refined tastes and feelings, and while I am permitted to live, your joys will be my joys, and your happiness shall be my happiness. I will endeavor, Louis," he added, in a trembling voice, "to make amends for those misfortunes which have fallen upon you through a calamity which could not have been foreseen."</p>
               <p>"My dear father," Grattan replied, "you must not accuse yourself even in thought. We will crowd the happiness which had been lost in past years, into those that yet remain to us; and if true affection can compensate for your years of sorrow and grief, you shall find it in these hearts here, which will be animated by but one impulse. I will struggle against every thought that is calculated to arouse the bitterness of my own nature, and for your sake try to believe that there is some honesty, some sympathy, some charity, yet in this world."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Grattan and the children had looked on during this dialogue in perfect silence, only broken by an occasional sigh or sob as their feelings were moved by the conversation of the father and son, and as it proceeded they had drawn nearer and nearer to one or the other of the speakers, and now clung to them as if fearful some accident might again separate them.</p>
               <p>"My son," Grey replied to Grattan's last remark, "you can not conceive how my heart is filled with joy and thankfulness to find you possessed of such noble sentiments and so worthy in every way of all that is in my power to do for you. The name will be worthily represented by you."</p>
               <p>"That reminds me, father, that I wished to ask you why my name came to be changed?"</p>
               <p>"True," said Grey, "this has not been explained, but it seems that your mother did not survive many hours after she came ashore, and in giving your name to Granny Stiles, she could make out nothing but Louis, and some other name that sounded like Grattan. The third name, Hewson, she either could not, or pretended she could not, get at all."</p>
               <pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC6567-00000188"/>
               <p>"She never called me Louis, but I suppose the familiar 'Jimmy,' which is the name she always gave me, is one of her own selection for her own purposes."</p>
               <p>"I suppose so," Grey answered; "your whole name is Louis Grattan Hewson, and it is not surprising that the old hag should have adopted the name Grattan, under the circumstances."</p>
               <p>"Then your name is not <emph>Grey,</emph> father, and I have still another to become familiar with."</p>
               <p>"My real name she might have kept concealed from you, Louis, if she had known it, and the name 'Jimmy,' which you speak of, was undoubtedly given you for no good purpose."</p>
               <p>"Oh, the old wretch!" cried Grattan, indignantly; "what misery she has caused me! I can not look back upon the years of my childhood without a shudder; her unfeeling tyranny makes my blood chill; I will not enter into details; she has been called to account in a terrible manner; we will let her rest in peace. But, father, where is poor Sharkey? why does he not make one of our party?"</p>
               <p>"He is very unhappy," said Grey, "and would naturally feel disinclined to be with us while matters were likely to be talked over in which he figured in no enviable light. But now that matters are explained, we must all do everything in our power to make him forget what is past, and look with hope into the future."</p>
               <p>"Such exertions will afford us all pleasure," Grattan replied; and after a moment's pause he asked: "where is Hugo? why is he not here, too, to partake of our joy? Poor fellow! this will only make his unhappy situation more painful by contrast."</p>
               <p>"He was here just before dinner," said Mrs. Grattan, "and we wished him to stay and dine with us, but he declined. Did he not say he would return this afternoon, Mary?"</p>
               <p>Mary blushed deeply at this question, and replied that he had said something about coming again after dinner.</p>
               <p>"Don't blush, Mary," Grey said, kindly; "you have nothing to be ashamed of. Hugo is as noble a young man as ever lived, and it shall be my care to provide for you both at the proper time."</p>
               <p>Mr. Grattan looked surprised at this, and said to Mary, who had come forward and thrown herself, in tears, upon his breast, as Grey proceeded—</p>
               <p>"My daughter, if this means that you and Hugo have pledged your young hearts to each other, I have only to say that a worthier pair were never so pledged."</p>
               <p>"There, Mary!" Grey laughingly exclaimed, and kissing her kindly, "dry your eyes; he is coming along the hall now, or my ears deceive me. You are much richer than any of us."</p>
               <p>As he concluded, Hugo presented himself at the door, not, however, until Mary had retreated to her own room.</p>
               <p>Grattan received him warmly, and Hugo's heartfelt congratulations were so honest and fervent, and his manner spoke so plainly of the thoughts of his own situation, which were passing through his mind, that Grey, interpreting his conduct aright, caught him by his arm, and, drawing him affectionately to his side, tried to speak words of encouragement to him—</p>
               <p>"Come, come, Hugo! we must have none but happy hearts here; you are one of <emph>us</emph> now, and shall be cared for like the rest; it is but one family now, my boy; dry your eyes." This had the effect to open the floodgates of Hugo's heart, and he leaned upon the old man's shoulder and wept like a child.</p>
               <p>Recovering himself as soon as possible, he turned to Grattan, as if suddenly recollecting himself, and told him that Byrnie was below and desired to come up and give him joy of his changed prospects.</p>
               <p>"Show him up directly, Hugo," Grattan replied, with a look of pleasure. "All here must know Byrnie; he is as noble a fellow as ever lived—too noble entirely for the atmosphere he lives in."</p>
               <p>Hugo went out, and after a short absence returned with Byrnie, who greeted his friend warmly, and was introduced<pb n="376-377" xml:id="VAC6567-00000189"/> to his father and family, and the whole party were soon seated and conversation became general. Byrnie's sallies of wit were irresistible, and his own buoyant spirit extended its influence to all.</p>
               <p>"I wonder," he said to Grattan, "that Broadway is not literally barricaded with the magnificent equipages of our aristocracy, come to pay homage to your new inheritance;" and added, with a merry laugh, "a slight halo of gold helps the eyesight wonderfully, my friends, and, in the language of our glorious Art, brings into bold relief what before may have been very obscure."</p>
               <p>"This reminds me," Mrs. Grattan suddenly interrupted, "that some gentlemen have called here and left their cards while you were sleeping, Mr. Grattan."</p>
               <p>"Bring them out, Mrs. Grattan," said Byrnie, rubbing his hands with glee; "I have no doubt they are from some of your husband's aristocratic acquaintances." And here he drew down his face with a droll expression that was perfectly irresistible.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Grattan brought the cards, and Byrnie eagerly reached his hand for them, and, once in his possession, he commenced reading them with an air that made even Grey laugh roundly.</p>
               <p>"'James Grabb, broker, Wall Street,'" said Byrnie, reading the card in a loud voice, and added, "would like to grab any loose cash Mr. Grattan may have to place in his clutches. 'Office hours from nine A.M. till two P.M.' 'Theophilus Gamble'—ha! ha!" roared Byrnie, as he read this name; "don't let him gamble on your money, Grattan, 'Carter Dodge, Esq.'" he continued, reading from another; holding this out before him, he looked at Grattan with a peculiar expression, and said: "you will do well to dodge him." Looking farther, he started almost from his seat at the name of the Hon. Peter Cognovit, and exclaimed, "This surpasses anything I ever heard of. Well, Grattan, you will have more orders before the week is out than you can fill in a year. Mark my words: Cavil, the spiritual adviser of our "solid men," will call upon you before many days, to give you ghostly advice, now that your purse is long enough to pay for it; and if you play your cards right, you will be in favor with his whole congregation, and the recipient of their most distinguished favors."</p>
               <p>"Who is Cavil?" Grattan asked.</p>
               <p>"Don't you remember the sleepy-looking gentleman I called your attention to at Mason &amp; Carter's some time ago?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, Byrnie, I remember. It was the day those gentlemen were so taken in by Hugo's group of dogs."</p>
               <p>"Exactly; and you recollect I told you that he would call as soon as you had succeeded in attracting the notice of some of the wealthy members of his congregation, which you have now done most effectually. I should like to be present at the interview, if he does come. Don't forget your old friends among the new ones who will flutter around you, Grattan, in the new sphere to which you will now be suddenly elevated. I will call as often as my <emph>pressing</emph> engagements will permit, to give you the benefit of my advice and experience in the management of your fortune." With these words, Byrnie left. His auditors had followed him through his rambling discourse, full of good-humor at the merry sort of indifference with which he viewed life.</p>
               <p>"A better heart never beat than Byrnie's," said Grattan, as the door closed behind him; "but there is real sorrow and grief beneath this exterior of humor."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXXV.</head>
               <head type="sub">EXCURSION UP THE HUDSON—WHAT OCCURRED ON THE WAY—GOLD MAKES FRIENDS—THE COTTAGE NEAR THE CATSKILLS—POOR SHARKEY!</head>
               <p>FOR some weeks after this the family continued to board at the Astor House, and Grey was making all about him as comfortable as possible. Himself, Sharkey, and Grattan were to start for England as soon as he could remove Grattan's family to a piece of property which he had purchased on the Hudson, not far from the Catskill Mountains, where he proposed to leave Mrs. Grattan and her family in charge of Hugo, who was to spend a portion of his time with them.</p>
               <p>Hugo's new rooms in the Art-Union building had been elegantly furnished, and he was now boarding with the family of Grattan at the Astor House—a state of things which did not much contribute to his happiness, as the mortification of being under obligations even to his best friends for all these comforts, detracted much from his enjoyment. But there was no evading it; and since he had either to be under obligations to Joe Tyson or Mr. Grey, he chose the latter, particularly as all the means he had advanced to him, some five or six hundred dollars, came in the shape of commissions for pictures, which the kind old gentleman said he wanted for their new house. Byrnie had also received a handsome commission, and the whole family were to sit to Brown so soon as they were settled.</p>
               <p>Thus Grey, not content with filling hearts with joy which were near and dear to him, early began to seek for worthy objects upon whom to lavish a portion of his means. His son was provided with everything that his heart could desire, and money was furnished to him to dispose of in his own way, so that he need feel no embarrassment in gratifying any of his tastes to the fullest.</p>
               <p>Furniture, carpets, and all the necessaries for the new establishment were already shipped to their future home some weeks before, and the whole family, including Byrnie, were assembled, when we again return to them, in the public parlor, awaiting the arrival of the carriage which was to take them to the landing.</p>
               <p>They were all going to spend a week or two with Grattan's family at their delightful country house, after which Grey, Grattan, and Sharkey would sail for England to settle up Grey's affairs there, previous to returning here to reside permanently. Sketching materials and sketching stools were liberally provided, and a delightful time was anticipated by the artists, and Grey was running about happy as a child, acting as general superintendent; looking after trunks, packages, parcels, etc., and asking a thousand questions of every member of the party to assure himself that nothing had been forgotten, and he did not cease his inquiries even when they were all in the carriage and fairly under way for the landing.</p>
               <p>Had the children all been provided with necessary clothing? Had Kate and Mary dresses, shawls, and other conveniences and necessaries for the trip? Had Louis forgotten nothing? How did Duncan feel? had not he better put on his overcoat? Had Hugo and Byrnie provided themselves sufficiently with all that was needful for their comfort or pleasure? And these anxious inquiries of the kind-hearted old man had not ceased when they arrived at the landing and were pushing there way aboard of the magnificent steamer which was to convey them to within a short distance of their destination. Everything here was bustle and confusion. Parties of pleasure for Saratoga, the Mountain House, Lake George, West Point, and many other places of public resort, were scrambling and hurrying to get on board; and drivers,<pb n="380-381" xml:id="VAC6567-00000191"/> porters, news-boys, pamphlet-venders, and all the general attendants upon such an occasion, crowded and elbowed one at every turn. Grey, experienced in such matters, had previously secured berths for his whole party, and now saw that their baggage was safely on board before he joined the others, who had hurriedly deposited carpet-sacks, satchels, shawls, overcoats, etc., in their state-rooms, and were walking up and down the magnificent cabin, enjoying the trip in anticipation, and laughing at the lively sallies of Byrnie, who had some sarcastic remark or witty joke at the expense of every new party that huddled through the cabin in search of state-rooms.</p>
               <p>Grey laid aside his overcoat and valise, and after going to Sharkey's state-room, where he had gone to lie down, and asking many kind questions in regard to his health, he joined the others in their promenade about the boat, which was soon "rounded to" and under headway up one of the most magnificent streams in the world.</p>
               <p>Byrnie, Hugo, and Mary, arm-in-arm, followed by Grattan, Grey, and Mrs. Grattan, were about to go on deck to enjoy the beautiful views which here at every mile open upon the sight, when their attention was attracted by a coarse, fat woman, bedizened with jewelry, silks, and laces, who came swinging out of one of the state-rooms near them, and commenced calling, in a wheezing voice that came rattling up through her throat as if she was struggling against strangulation—</p>
               <p>"John! John! where are you, sir? Come here, John, instantly! I am astonished at you, sir, that you dare to venture about the boat without your father or me!" she continued, as the aforesaid John made his appearance.</p>
               <p>"I was with father," the boy replied; "we were only just out on the guards there a little bit."</p>
               <p>"Well, sir," the fat lady continued, in a peremptory voice, "tell your father to come here, <emph>instantly.</emph> I am not going to be melted in that state-room," she said, pointing to the one she had just left, angrily, "it is almost over the boilers, and it is hot enough, dear knows, without seeking any artificial means to swelter one's self."</p>
               <p>At the conclusion of these sentences the fat lady shook herself with the air of one who had never known contradiction, and John departed for the father.</p>
               <p>Byrnie exclaimed to Hugo, in a low voice: "Lord preserve us from any such calamity as the woman seems to dread—the boat would be deluged with grease. But look there! there comes Johnny with his father—and as I live it is old Gamble! Now we shall have some fun, for certainly there are others of the same class of the 'genus homo' on board." Here the whole party bowed to Gamble, as he passed on to listen in private to his wife's complaints, and Byrne continued: "These folks have all called, I suppose, long ago, Miss Mary, have they not?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes!" Mary replied, with a laugh; "all those whose cards amused you so much, the first evening <emph>you</emph> called to see us; and a great many more."</p>
               <p>"You will find New York a queer place, miss. Everything depends upon the dress a thing is got up in. A little gilding will brighten up a character that has been blacker than 'Egyptian darkness,' and a fine broadcloth coat, a few finger rings, and a gold chain will convert an ass into a gentleman."</p>
               <p>"I have no love for the city, Mr. Byrnie, and I am perfectly happy that we are going again to the country. I know our new home will be a pleasant one, as our dear old grandfather has such fine taste, and such an appreciation of the beautiful, that I feel sure I shall be perfectly delighted with the place he has purchased for us."</p>
               <p>"No doubt," Byrnie replied, "it will be all that could be desired. Your grandfather, miss, is one of the most extraordinary men I have ever met. He has means and he has taste; he has affections that are pure and fresh, which he does not take especial pains to disguise or root out of his nature entirely; he is honest, and acts from honest impulses; he is moral without being bigoted; he has wealth without being avaricious. If these are not enough," he continued,<pb n="382-383" xml:id="VAC6567-00000192"/> laughing heartily, "to constitute him a miracle, in these times, I am no judge."</p>
               <p>"I could listen to the praises of my grandfather forever," said Mary; "and I am not mortified with any internal convictions that every word you said is not true."</p>
               <p>As Mary closed this sentence, the whole party came upon deck, and exclamation followed exclamation as one object or another attracted the admiration of some one of the party, and the delightful air and sunshine seemed to warm and invigorate the hearts of all.</p>
               <p>The deck was covered with passengers no less curious, and apparently as happy, as these in whom we are just now more particularly interested; and it was some time before Hugo and Byrnie could find seats for the ladies and Mr. Grey.</p>
               <p>As Byrnie gave a seat to Mrs. Grattan, he turned to Grattan and Hugo with a countenance full of concealed humor, and said: "We have, just as I expected, a strong delegation of the 'cod-fish' on board. As I was coming back with the stools, just there by the wheel-house, a gentleman touched me on the elbow, and when I turned, who should present himself but the Hon. Peter Cognovit. He bowed profoundly and with marked respect, and asked me if it were true that Mr. Grey and 'his party' were on board. Distancing him altogether in the magnificent grandeur of my bow, I told him that I was happily a member of that party, and that Mr. Grey was at that time a little farther forward on the deck, and would, no doubt, be glad to greet him. With this, another pair of profoundly polite bows, and the Hon. Peter Cognovit and George Jarvis Byrnie, P.X.T., separated. Did I do right, Mr. Grey?"</p>
               <p>"Perfectly right, Byrnie," Grey replied, laughing at his humorous description of the interview.</p>
               <p>"The whole party will be here in a few minutes," Byrnie rejoined, "whoever they may be, and perhaps you will not then say perfectly right."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I shall, even in that case," Grey answered. "I have seen enough of the world to know that the most quiet way to get through it is to treat those with politeness, at least, who are disposed (no matter from what motives) to pay you attention."</p>
               <p>While Grey was yet speaking, a party of gentlemen, among whom Mr. Carter Dodge, the Hon. P. Cognovit, Mr. Gamble, Mr. Grabb, and the Rev. Mr. Cavil were quite distinguishable, were making their way toward them; and as they approached, Byrnie said, loud enough for our friends all to hear—</p>
               <p>"Now we shall see how much shallow ignorance and conceit, even in the very distinguished individuals who are about to bestow such attention on the party of Mr. Grey, can swagger and assume, upon the strength of its money capital, which stands here in the place of brains. Hugo, we shall all have commissions as sure as we are here. Stand back," he said, in a low voice, "and 'we shall see what we shall see.'"</p>
               <p>As Byrnie concluded this sentence, the gentlemen alluded to joined their party, and introductions followed among those not already acquainted; and after the first formalities were over, and each member of the party had told some other member what he already knew—viz., that it was a beautiful day, a fine breeze, a fast boat, a glorious river, etc.—the conversation became more general. Mary and her mother, feeling, perhaps, overawed by the predominance of the opposite sex, left the gentlemen as soon as politeness would permit, and walked farther forward.</p>
               <p>Hugo's eyes followed the lovely form of Mary, and he would gladly have followed in person had he not been obliged to remain and listen to compliments, coarse and palpably insincere, lavished upon himself, Grattan, and Byrnie. "This is the young gentleman, Mr. Tompkins," said the Hon. Peter Cognovit, pointing to Hugo, "who painted that wonderful group of dogs that you purchased from Mason &amp; Carter, and about which I confess I was somewhat skeptical. This is Hugo Blanc, and this gentleman," he said to Hugo, "is a great admirer of yours—Mr. Jonas Tompkins."</p>
               <p>"Ah, young man!" said Mr. Tompkins, "I am happy, indeed<pb n="384-385" xml:id="VAC6567-00000193"/> deed, to make your acquaintance. Wonderful talent you have, indeed; are you on a sketching excursion now?"</p>
               <p>"Partly," Hugo answered, modestly; "Mr. Grey has purchased a country-seat somewhere near the village of ——, and we are going to see our friends comfortably settled and have a few days' sketching in the Catskills."</p>
               <p>"Delightful!" said Mr. Tompkins, "delightful! We shall, no doubt, have the pleasure of meeting you at the Mountain House before you return to the city? Do me the kindness, my young friend, to select from your sketches some piece which you can work into a picture for me. I shall not limit you in the price—that I leave entirely to you."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Mr. Tompkins," said Hugo, hanging his head, and hardly able to keep from laughing, as Byrnie gave him some vigorous punches with his elbow—"thank you; I shall endeavor to please you."</p>
               <p>"No doubt you will—no doubt you will; you have wonderful talent. Mr. Grattan, I believe, sir?" he said, turning and addressing that gentleman. "I understand you design visiting England with your father shortly."</p>
               <p>"Yes," Mr. Grattan replied, "as soon as my family feel settled in their new home."</p>
               <p>"Ah, indeed!" exclaimed Mr. Grabb, "is this so? I must beg of you, then, Mr. Grattan, to bring me a bit of English scenery—anything that you may select. How long will you remain?"</p>
               <p>"That will depend entirely upon my father," Grattan answered.</p>
               <p>"I can not tell, gentlemen, how long we will probably be absent; it depends entirely upon circumstances; at least, however, six months, and perhaps longer," Grey replied.</p>
               <p>"Oh, you will have time enough to remember <emph>all</emph> of your admirers, Mr. Grattan," chimed in the Hon. Peter Cognovit, "and I shall also expect something. Do you visit the Continent?"</p>
               <p>"Not at this time, sir; but I shall make another visit in company with my young friend here, expressly to see the world of Art, as soon as I can make arrangements to do so after my return."</p>
               <p>Hugo blushed scarlet at this announcement, as he had not even heard that such a thing was in contemplation, and it revealed to him how entirely he was looked upon not only by Grey, but by Grattan and all the family, as already one of its members.</p>
               <p>"You will not visit the Continent without giving your friends due notice?" said Mr. Tompkins.</p>
               <p>"Oh, there will be full notice, Mr. Tompkins. Mr. Byrnie will, I hope, also accompany us," he added, desirous that our humorous friend should receive a little of their notice.</p>
               <p>"Byrnie! did you say, Mr. Grattan? Byrnie, did I understand you?" Mr. Carter Dodge exclaimed, coming forward and confronting Byrnie; "is this gentleman the artist Byrnie?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir," said Mr. Grattan; "Mr. Byrnie, Mr. Dodge."</p>
               <p>"Ah, Mr. Dodge," said Byrnie, bowing low, "I am glad to meet you, sir—knew you by reputation, sir, but have never before had the pleasure of an introduction." This was followed by a profound bow from Byrnie, who could not, however, avoid the opportunity of treading on Grattan's toes significantly, and then turned away to conceal a smile, as Mr. Dodge replied—</p>
               <p>"This is a pleasure, Mr. Byrnie, I didn't anticipate; quite unexpected, I assure you; none the less agreeable, however, I assure you. I am the owner, sir, of one of your pictures, which, believe me, gives me great pleasure—purchased it not long since in the Art-Union rooms. I thought of calling on you with a commission, but my business engagements have prevented. Paint me something that suits your fancy, Mr. Byrnie, and draw on me at any time."</p>
               <p>Byrnie returned his thanks in a style as pompous as Mr. Dodge's, and after expressing ardent wishes to meet Mr. Grey's party at the Mountain House, the two again separated.</p>
               <p>Mr. Grattan, in the mean time, had been drawn into conversation<pb n="386-387" xml:id="VAC6567-00000194"/> versation with the Rev. Mr. Cavil, who took occasion to congratulate him upon his good fortune and the extraordinary restoration to his father after so many years of privation and hope deferred. "You have, like most artists, Mr. Grattan, passed through a fiery ordeal, to emerge at length with enduring laurels which will be all the more highly prized for the very struggles which have at length made you worthy of them."</p>
               <p>Mr. Grattan did not altogether like the termination of this speech, and there was a patronizing air about the reverend gentleman which, coupled with Byrnie's previous description of the man, made him knit his brow somewhat, as he replied: "Excuse me, Mr. Cavil, I am not conscious of being any more worthy of what you call my good fortune to-day than I was twenty years ago. Indeed, much of my natural hope-fulness—much of my faith in men—much of the best of my nature—has gone, I fear, never to return. The fiery ordeal to which you allude has left me, in common with most of my class who have been subjected to it, in much the same condition as other substances which are sometimes subjected to fiery ordeals. There is little left but charred and blackened cinders—very little of the original material."</p>
               <p>"This is a very unpleasant picture, Mr. Grattan, and I hope it is not so bad as you represent. You artists are a strange set of men, and it is seldom the case that you take a practical view of life. However, you find yourself appreciated now, and will no doubt be rewarded fully for all your sacrifices."</p>
               <p>"Rather say, Mr. Cavil, that my pecuniary prospects are appreciated. I might have lived in New York in the condition that I found myself but a short time since, until I was as old as Methuselah, and never have been better received, better understood, or better appreciated. It can not be said that I have seen so much of the world without having learned some lesson that will last me through life."</p>
               <p>"Beware, Mr. Grattan," the reverend gentleman replied, solemnly, "that these lessons do not lead you to do injustice to God and his holy religion, as well as to man. Whatever be our condition, would it not be the part of wisdom to accommodate ourselves to circumstances as they are wisely ordered?"</p>
               <p>This was too much for Mr. Grattan, as it was asserting that which he did not believe, and he exclaimed, in some heat: "Ordered! this, Mr. Cavil, is the everlasting cry of those (clergy as well as laity) who are well satisfied with the present unjust and unequal state of things, and the iniquitous injustice of man to man in every form and under every conceivable garb. You find it very convenient to charge upon the Almighty in this never-ending song, 'It is so ordered,' and when it suits you, you add '<emph>wisely.</emph>' The religion of the present day, Mr. Cavil, is entirely too flexible, and but little like that of its Founder."</p>
               <p>Mr. Cavil looked about him uneasily, as if conscious that he had a dangerous antagonist, and no doubt wishing that some of his friends would happen along and relieve him from his position. He, however, ventured to reply that "true religion should not be condemned because there were sometimes found spurious imitations; neither, Mr. Grattan, should really good men be made to answer for the sins of the bad."</p>
               <p>"My remarks were not directed against <emph>true</emph> religion or <emph>true</emph> men, but rather against the spurious imitations you allude to, which pass current for the pure coin. I have as much respect for true religion as any man, but I have, unfortunately, seen but little of it, and, judging from the effects of the labors of those who profess to believe and teach, there is but little of it left in the world at this time. Jesus Christ, and his disciples of old, taught what they believed, and practiced what they taught, but his disciples of our time, teaching the self-same doctrine, practice what they please."</p>
               <p>"I hope, Mr. Grattan," the reverend gentleman replied, drawing himself up in a dignified manner, "you do not mean any personal reflections by this language?"</p>
               <p>"By no means, Mr. Cavil; I could not so far forget myself. If you are an exception to the rule, my remarks can do<pb n="388-389" xml:id="VAC6567-00000195"/> you no harm. If you disagree with me in opinion, this is no reason why we should not be friends. If I believe that fashion has usurped the place of religion, and you disagree with me, you fall short of your duty if you do not try to convince me of my error. If I believe that money has taken the place of God in the hearts of men, and you believe the contrary, it is an open question between us, and earnest opinion on either side can be adhered to, I trust, without the suspicion of being personal."</p>
               <p>"I am glad that I have misunderstood you, Mr. Grattan, and there are errors in your opinions, which I shall be pleased at some future day to point out, as I fear they may result in fatal consequences. I must join my friends now, but will do myself the pleasure to see you at your rooms in the city at an early day." With these remarks, he bowed himself out of the unpleasant interview, and in but a few minutes afterward was expressing his pious horror and indignation at the sentiments of Mr. Grattan, to his wealthy friends in another part of the boat.</p>
               <p>Hugo, in the mean time, was seated beside Mary upon the bow of the steamer, whither he had gone as soon as he could find a favorable opportunity to leave the other gentlemen; and when Mrs. Grattan left him and rejoined her husband, Grey and Byrnie were now laughing heartily as they detailed to each other the conversation just narrated.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Grattan," Byrnie said, as she drew near, and offering her at the same time a seat, "our fortunes are made, madam! Upper-tendom has spoken! Louis Grattan, Hugo Blanc, and your humble servant," he added, bowing low, "are <emph>the</emph> artists of New York for the next six months, if they do not get reduced to bread and molasses again before that time."</p>
               <p>"Why, Mr. Byrnie, what has happened?"</p>
               <p>"Every one of us commissioned, as I predicted. Oh! is it not one of the funniest things in the world? What a talisman is this gold!"</p>
               <p>"It is, indeed, Mr. Byrnie; but such circumstances as these are calculated to engender unpleasant suspicions of our fellow-creatures creatures, which cause us more unhappiness than we at first would suppose."</p>
               <p>"There," said Grey, noticing the cloud upon his son's brow, "that will do; we won't talk any more of these matters at present;" and taking Mrs. Grattan's arm through his own, he commenced sauntering about the deck, and Grattan and Byrnie followed, arm-in-arm, and discussed together more coolly and dispassionately all the strange occurrences of the past few weeks.</p>
               <p>Nothing further of interest transpired until their arrival at the little village of ——, where they parted from their New York friends, with many hopes on both sides that circumstances would permit them to meet at the Mountain House in a few days.</p>
               <p>The trip had been delightful to all parties. Hugo and Mary, the happiest of the happy, had scarcely separated for a moment after he joined her upon the bow of the boat, and their present and future were canvassed with happy contemplations on both sides. The same scenes were admired by both as the noble craft plowed its way up the stream; the same mass of clouds brought forth admiring exclamations from both, and when at length the Mountain House became visible, and the beautiful range of the Catskills, they became perfectly enthusiastic, and the cloud-shadows, as they dragged their slow length up the mountain sides, filled them with delight. Grey and Mrs. Grattan would sometimes, unobserved, draw near the happy pair, and as the old man listened to their joyous exclamations, he found frequent use for his handkerchief to clear his eyes sufficiently to see the beautiful things which they were pointing out to each other—and then, with a remark to Mrs. Grattan, that they were "certainly designed for each other," they would resume their promenade. Grattan and Byrnie were no less delighted, the latter particularly so, as this was the first trip he had taken out of the city for a year, and these glorious sights, the fresh breeze, and smiling nature all around him, so elated him, and so stirred up the fountains of his enthusiastic nature, that he was as merry and<pb n="390-391" xml:id="VAC6567-00000196"/> happy as a school-boy during vacation. And a constant torrent of wit, sarcasm, and sentiment kept Grattan in a perpetual roar of laughter.</p>
               <p>Thus they arrived at ——, and to their great satisfaction they found that the servants sent forward with the household goods had left word that they would be in condition to receive them there whenever they came. This added greatly to their happiness, as the prospect of stopping at a hotel for the night, or perhaps for a longer time, was anything but pleasant. They had nothing now to do but secure a conveyance, which was no difficult matter here, and started forthwith. Parties destined for the Mountain House had long since proceeded in coaches, which ran to that place, and our friends soon found themselves whirling over a beautiful road, which wound along the bank of the river—all, however, except Grattan and Grey, ignorant of their destination.</p>
               <p>The road they were following gradually left the river, and began to ascend more and more as they approached the mountains, which lie but a few miles from the shore. At length the driver, who received his instructions from Grey, who was riding with him, turned suddenly to the left and entered a lane bordered on either side by magnificent chestnuts, oaks, and other forest trees, and a few rods in advance of them a beautiful cottage could be partially seen through the trees which surrounded it. The noise of the approaching carriage had aroused the inmates, and a large gate, which opened into the lane, was swung back upon its hinges by one of the servants, and the carriage, following a semicircular carriage-way, drove up in front of an elegant veranda, and the happy travelers alighted amid the boxes and packages, opened and unopened, which covered it from one end to the other. A few rooms had been put in order, and as they were gathering upon the veranda, what was their surprise to see Joe Tyson come forward to welcome them, followed by his wife and the sweet little Mary.</p>
               <p>"Why, Joe!" said Hugo, running forward to him and seiz ing both his brawny hands, "what does this mean? is it possible that <emph>you</emph> are to live here with us?"</p>
               <p>"So it seems," Joe answered; "Mr. Grey has made us a home here, he says, for so long as we are satisfied to remain."</p>
               <p>"Did you get the carriage and horses here safe, Joe?" Mr. Grey inquired.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, they were all in fine condition, and I should have driven down to —— to meet you, but you ordered me not to do so."</p>
               <p>"All right, Joe," said Grey; "it was just as well to come out in a hired carriage, and I was not certain that we would be here to-day. Louis, my dear son," he said, turning to Grattan, "this is <emph>your</emph> house, to which you can in future welcome your <emph>real</emph> friends, and dispense its hospitalities, which shall be neither meager nor stinted. I have named it 'Denwood,' after my English home, which name will serve to keep fresh in my mind pleasures that are past, never to return."</p>
               <p>Grattan could only grasp his father's hand without replying, and retire hastily into the house, while all present were variously affected by the noble and unselfish kindness of Grey, whose sole object now seemed to be to compensate his son, by every means in his power, for the sad experiences of his past life.</p>
               <p>It was now nearly sunset, and while supper was being prepared, under the supervision of Joe Tyson's wife, the various members of this happy family were scattered over the grounds and through the house, admiring and wondering. Sharkey, who had appeared unwell when they left the city, grew worse during the day, and retired to a bedroom provided for him immediately after their arrival. This circumstance alone seemed to alloy their happiness, and although but little was said, there was a general impression that "poor Sharkey," as they all called him, was more unwell than he seemed willing to acknowledge.</p>
               <p>A week, abounding in pleasant experiences to all, was passed here and enjoyed to the very fullest extent by every individual of the little family party. Visits from the distinguished<pb n="392-393" xml:id="VAC6567-00000197"/> guished sojourners at the Mountain House were received and returned; picnic parties and sketching excursions made our friends familiar with many of the beautiful localities of the neighborhood, and past sufferings and disappointments, struggles and mortifications, as well as anticipations of the future, seemed swallowed up in the present joy and happiness.</p>
               <p>Hugo and Mary were in a delirium of unutterable delight, and wandered unrestrained together wherever fancy led them, giving pleasure to those who witnessed the purity of their feelings and the untrammeled and unsophisticated exhibition of these under every circumstance. For hours they would sit upon the mountain-side, watching the distant steamers and vessels as they passed and re-passed upon the broad bosom of the noble Hudson, and would drink together from the pure fountains of nature in dreamy silence, joys too deep for words—joys unknown and unappreciated except by refined and intellectual natures. Again, wandering through shaded ravines or upon the rugged mountain-side, new pleasures would be derived from other and no less pure sources, and the happy pair would return in the evening loaded with wild flowers, ferns, cuttings of pine, hemlock, and strange scrubs, with which the parlor vases were filled and adorned every day.</p>
               <p>Reader, we will close this chapter by an announcement which broke in with melancholy sadness upon the pleasures of our friends, and for the balance of their stay checked the current of their new-found happiness. Poor Sharkey was found dead in his bed a few mornings after their arrival, having died in the night (probably without a struggle), a victim to uncurbed passions and remorseful penitence, full of good resolutions, which came too late to be put into practice.</p>
               <p>He was buried upon the mountain-side, upon a projecting point which commanded a magnificent view up and down the river, and a beautiful marble obelisk marks his resting-place.</p>

               <head type="sub">PASTIMES AT DENWOOD—LETTERS FROM MR. GRATTAN, LOUISE, AND MR. BLANC—THEIR CONTENTS DISCUSSED—MATRIMONY IN PROSPECT.</head>
               <p>A FEW brief days of happiness, the forerunners of many which were to follow, and the party at Denwood is broken up. Hugo and Byrnie have returned to the city to follow their vocations under pleasanter auspices; Grey and Grattan have sailed for England, and, upon the broad ocean, are divided in their emotions between the pain of leaving so many loved ones behind, and the pleasurable anticipations of the future, which, as they look forward, is obscured by no cloud, but is bright with promise.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Grattan and Mary have become quite at home in their new abode, where they are provided with everything that heart could wish, and with Joe Tyson as general manager during Hugo's absence in the city, nothing is left undone that can be done to make them happy. It is settled that the marriage of Hugo and Mary is to take place immediately on the return of Grey and Grattan, and Mr. Blanc has been written to for his consent—and himself, Mrs. Blanc, and Louise invited to spend a few weeks with them before the celebration of the nuptials.</p>
               <p>Hugo Blanc has risen to the height of popular favor, and has employment for every moment of his time, and to be the possessor of one of his works is quite a distinction even in New York.</p>
               <p>Byrnie is his constant companion, and frequently visits Denwood with him when he goes up (which is generally<pb n="394-395" xml:id="VAC6567-00000198"/> every Saturday), and returns with him again on Monday. <emph>His</emph> fortune has also mended, and he is in finer spirits than ever, but still indulges in his humorous sarcasms at the world.</p>
               <p>Brown has been to Denwood and executed elegant portraits of Mrs. Grattan and Mary, and the patronage of the millionaire Grey has called around him, in admiring crowds, all the apes and toadies in Gotham. He has elegantly furnished rooms upon the second floor of a fine block of buildings near the Art Union, and the new star has paled the luster of Adolphus Rembrandt Tucker, who now promenades Broadway looking quite a different being from what we last saw him, and those <emph>discriminating</emph> friends who thronged his rooms when we first introduced him to our reader, have deserted him. Adolphus, reader, is seedy—his hair is not so scrupulously combed or curled; his cane is not flourished with so much confidence; his gait is not so erect; his hat is not so glossy or so jauntily perched upon his head. Adolphus, in his general appearance, is dilapidated, and there are none to sorrow or sympathize with him. Others have risen into notice and taken his place, not, my dear reader, because they are appreciated or understood, or because there is any greater disposition to encourage true merit, by no means; but this has happened because the wealthy Mr. Grey, a man of acknowledged taste and means, has taken these worthies under his protection, and is disposed to advance them because he is conscious of their merit. This is enough to draw upon popular favor, and we can throw ourselves back in our easy chair (if we happen to enjoy such a luxury), perfectly satisfied that <emph>they</emph> at least, out of the large number of talented artists in the country, will no longer need our sympathies, so long, at any rate, as our kind old Grey continues to smile upon them.</p>
               <p>Months have gone by since the departure of Grey and his son, and every steamer brings from them to the impatient expectants at home, messages of love and long and interesting accounts of their doings and pleasures abroad.</p>
               <p>Three or four commissions, executed by Grattan in England land, have been sent home, and the papers have heralded their arrival in due form, lavishing unheard-of praises upon the artist, and duly chronicling the fact that "one is the property of that munificent patron of Art, the Hon. Peter Cognovit;" another commissioned by "Mr. Jonas Tompkins, a man who has one of the best private collections of Art works in America;" and a third "destined for the gallery of James Grabb, a well-known patron of Art." The same article publishes the fact that "the artist has executed many commissions, mostly from American subjects, for distinguished English noblemen, among whom figures conspicuously Lord Rattan, who boasts of a descent in a regular line from William Rufus; the Duke of Donghenny; the Earl of Littleton; Count Krakissky, Russian Charge to the Court of St. James; and many others known to fame, or in the records of English nobility."</p>
               <p>The next steamer which sailed for Europe after this announcement, carried out several new orders to Mr. Grattan; and is it strange, dear reader, that the artist who has been noticed in all the leading journals for months as the sole heir to an estate of some two or three millions, should receive commissions to his heart's content? And can you reasonably expect that other artists, just as good as himself, should be as well patronized, who have not been so fortunate in this respect? But these poor artists have their hearts warmed occasionally by a note like the following, containing a handsome inclosure:</p>

               <p>Heaven only knows what this example will lead to, but it is not at all unlikely that a "whirlwind of petticoats" will besiege the quarters of poor Albert Fordos, if the contents of this note should be made public, and he will be scarcely able to accommodate all the admirers of his genius.</p>
               <p>But we turn with pleasure to another class of Art patrons, who, though "few and far between," still are enough to keep our artists in tolerable heart, and encourage the little hope existing among them, that better times are coming—men of education and refinement, of correct taste and sound judgment, who, giving themselves time from their business pursuits to gratify these feelings, have preserved themselves bright, glorious examples of true men. We know many such, who shine out from amidst the gloom which envelops Art in the country, with a brilliancy quite dazzling and ever to be admired.</p>
               <p>Hugo had made many firm friends among the former of these two classes, and his talent was by them, and them only, fully appreciated. His room had already become a favorite place of resort for men of intellect and refinement, who patronized him because convinced of his innate worth, and not on account of his good fortune, either present or prospective.</p>
               <p>But let us return to Denwood. It is Saturday evening—an October evening—and the splendor of cloud and sky, as the sun sinks in the west, is rivaled by the gorgeous hues of the surrounding landscape. A dreamy haze pervades everything to such an extent that objects, even at a short distance, have, in the language of the artist, "no sharp outline," but rather appear like objects seen through a vail. Joe Tyson has gone with the carriage to the village of —— to meet Hugo, and supper is kept warm from him and the table waiting. Susie and her little daughter Mary are as happy at the prospect of seeing Hugo as Mrs. Grattan and that other Mary (whose heart has no other idol), who are sitting upon the veranda watching for the appearance of the carriage at the end of the avenue leading to the house. The steamer has passed an hour ago, and the black smoke from her chimneys can still be dimly seen far up the river as she nobly breasts the stream.</p>
               <p>Ah, there is a cloud of dust! Yes, it is the carriage just turning into the lane. Joe sits proudly upon the box, and the merry ring of his coach-whip shows how generously his heart throbs at the delight which it is his province to give to both the anxious expectants.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Grattan has risen and walked to the front of the veranda, and stands, with a sweet smile upon her face, watching the approaching carriage. But Mary, wild with joy, has bounded forward, and now stands at the great gate, ready to give the first greeting to him whose image has been with her constantly, and welcome him to hearts which only know him to love him.</p>
               <p>Hugo, no less joyous or eager, has sprung from the carriage, ran forward, embraced the lovely girl affectionately, and they are now, arm-in-arm, approaching the mother, who can hardly resist the impulse to run forward and fold them both in her arms.</p>
               <p>Little Mary Tyson, has caught sight of Hugo, and is now clinging to his hand, asking him over and over what he has brought for her; and Susie, standing a little behind Mrs. Grattan, her hands folded under her neat white apron, looks on no less happy than the rest.</p>
               <p>After an affectionate salute from Mrs. Grattan, and a warm shake of the hand from Susie, Hugo is led to the large parlor, and, seated with the mother on one side and the daughter on the other, is opening his carpet-sack, and the eager interest of the two ladies shows distinctly what they expect. At length letters are brought forth, after a great deal of vexatious delay on the part of Hugo—one for Mrs. Grattan from her husband, one to her also from Grey, one for Mary from Louise, and one for Hugo from Mr. Grattan.</p>
               <p>As these were being distributed, Mary watched Hugo with curious eyes; and when he had done, she asked, anxiously—</p>
               <p>"Did you get nothing from your father, Hugo? Has he not written yet?"</p>
               <pb n="398-399" xml:id="VAC6567-00000200"/>
               <p>"Yes, Mary," said Hugo, "I got a letter from father;" and he added, bitterly, "it is such a letter as no one but my father could write. But don't let us keep Susie's supper waiting. We can come here and spend the evening delightfully, reading our letters after that is over."</p>
               <p>"Oh, then," said Mary, clapping her hands joyfully together, "your father's letter is what we all have wished—he is reconciled?"</p>
               <p>"Don't anticipate, Mary," said Hugo, patting her cheek fondly; "whatever its contents, rest assured <emph>I</emph> feel but little complimented by it."</p>
               <p>The whole party adjourned to the supper-room, but with the exception of Hugo, not one of them ate with much appetite. His curiosity and anxiety upon the nature of his father's letter had been gratified, and the journey home had given him a keen relish for his evening meal; but out of compassion for Mary and Mrs. Grattan, he dispatched it as quickly as possible, and all returned again to the parlor.</p>
               <p>Lights were brought; the center-table was rolled to the middle of the room; the letters were thrown upon it, and the three sitting around it were soon engaged in devouring their contents with an eagerness which all will understand who have ever received a letter from a long-absent dear friend or relative.</p>
               <p>"Good! good! good!" Hugo exclaimed, over his letter; "that is the best news yet!"</p>
               <p>"What is it?" said Mary and her mother, in a breath, both dropping their letters to hear what had induced such a joyful exclamation.</p>
               <p>"Listen, Mary, what your father says—</p>
               <p>"We shall return home by the next steamer if I can possibly complete a picture which I am now working on for Lord Hardwicke. I have painted many from our old familiar haunts about Coldwell which have been commissioned by the nobility here. I have seen the glorious works of Turner, and I find myself incapable of giving you a description of them that will convey to you any idea of their peculiar merits. They are so different from the pictures of any other man, and executed upon such entirely different principles, that they must be seen to be appreciated. I have the prospect of a commission from the Queen, and if such an honor should be conferred upon me, I shall expect to be greeted with unusual respect on my return, such is the admiration for those who have even looked on royalty. Is it not disgraceful? London, Paris, and many other European cities are filled with American travelers who fawn and toady for a smile from some distinguished nobleman, and are as pertinacious in their demands for audiences, and as intoxicated if they are given, as the degraded sot who hangs around a low bar-room all day, until his longing for the liquid poison is gratified, and then reels home with scarcely sense enough to find his way. I love America and American institutions, and I could not be induced to live elsewhere, notwithstanding all the evils we have to complain of; and when I see our countrymen abroad aping the follies of the European aristocracy, and fawning for the smiles of titled fools, it fills me with inconceivable disgust.</p>
               <p>"'Art is but little better appreciated here than with us, and artist life is much the same, success depending upon much the same causes. A commission from some distinguished nobleman who has not a particle of taste, is sufficient to make the fortune of the veriest daub, while artists of towering genius, for the want of such notice, live as with us, in garrets and lumber-rooms, upon bread and water, until their overtaxed powers of endurance produce partial insanity, and they become desperadoes, or die by their own hands.</p>
               <p>"'The government here has recently become alive to the importance of government aid in the development of Art, and schools exist in many of the manufacturing districts which will eventually accomplish great results for Art in England.</p>
               <p>"'If the Congress of the United States, instead of holding long sessions to make a satisfactory division among hungry political harpies, of the immense revenues of the nation,<pb n="400-401" xml:id="VAC6567-00000201"/> would appropriate a fair proportion of these revenues to some such purpose, thereby giving a permanent and fixed aid to Art, American genius in this branch would as much astonish the world as it has in every other where there has been proper encouragement.</p>
               <p>"'I shall bring home for our collection some fine pictures which have been presented to me, or exchanged for sketches of my own, by artist-friends here. Among them is a small Turner, a Landseer, one from Stanfield; a beautiful sea-piece by Clint, a fine marine painter; and many others that will afford you delight and instruction.'"</p>
               <p>"Will not this be delightful," Hugo asked, as he paused in his letter, "to have specimens from some of the first English artists, where we can see them every day? And are not the facts your father alludes to in regard to Americans abroad, enough to make every American cheek crimson with shame?"</p>
               <p>"This is all very true," Mrs. Grattan replied; "but so long as we countenance such exhibitions as are witnessed in Broadway every day, we must not be surprised that when such people go abroad they return anti-republican in manners, tastes, and feelings. Here, at home, is the place, Hugo, to commence the reform."</p>
               <p>Here Mary remarked that she had something to read them from Louise's letter that would delight them very much—and proceeded as follows:</p>
               <p>"We have been surprised and happy at the almost daily accounts we hear of the wonderful progress of our dear Hugo. But the communication in his last letter, although it has not surprised us so much, has made us all—even father—happy. As for me, Mary, I can hardly restrain myself; I long for that meeting with you when I am to claim you as my sister, and I can scarcely wait the time. Now don't jump out of your chair, Mary: Doctor Draper will visit New York in a few days, and I shall accompany him as far as Denwood to remain a long—long time. Father and mother will be there some week or two before the occurrence of that happy event which is to unite us all again as we were long ago."</p>
               <p>Hugo had leaned forward as Mary proceeded, with a flushed and happy countenance, and when she had concluded, he asked, eagerly—</p>
               <p>"<emph>Does</emph> she say that? Mary, is <emph>all that,</emph> there?"</p>
               <p>"Every word of it, Hugo—every word; is it not strange? Oh! shall we not be <emph>so</emph> happy?"</p>
               <p>"Why," said Hugo, thoughtfully, "Louise will be here in a few days; I shall most likely find her here when I come up next Saturday."</p>
               <p>"Now, Hugo," said Mary, coaxingly, "<emph>do</emph> read us your father's letter."</p>
               <p>"Mary, it is a painful letter to read; and although it sanctions all our wishes, yet the motives that have influenced my father are such that I can not dwell upon them without a sense of shame."</p>
               <p>"No matter about the motive, Hugo; when once we have your father here, surrounded by an atmosphere so pervaded with happiness; with so many things in nature and art to appeal to his better feelings; with my father and our dear old grandfather for companions, he must become like the rest of us, Hugo; he can not help it. Read us the letter, now do."</p>
               <p>Thus urged, Hugo read his father's letter; it was exceedingly brief, considering the matter of which it treated, and ran thus:</p>

               <p>"Well," said Mary, who had risen and was leaning affectionately<pb n="402-403" xml:id="VAC6567-00000202"/> tionately on Hugo's shoulder while he read, "I don't see anything in that, that should make you feel so badly."</p>
               <p>"Well, Mary, if you don't see it, I shall not point it out to you."</p>
               <p>"Oh, it is a little cold, to be sure, Hugo; but your father has been so long angry with you that you could hardly expect anything else at present. We shall see him a different man before he leaves us."</p>
               <p>Mary understood well enough the purport of this letter, and these remarks were only intended to soothe Hugo, whose feelings were evidently sorely wounded by the manner in which his father treated a subject which with him absorbed every other feeling.</p>
               <p>"Give me that letter, Hugo," said Mary; "I want to keep it. You will only let it make you unhappy every time you look into it;" and as she spoke she took it out of his hand, folded it up carefully in the envelope, and turning to her mother, asked: "Mother, does father say nothing to <emph>you</emph> that will be interesting to us?"</p>
               <p>"I will read some passages," Mrs. Grattan replied, "and you can judge of their interest yourselves. Here is what he says of his visit to some places of interest to him, as connected with his father's past history:</p>
               <p>"'I went yesterday with father to the country residence where he resided at the time Sharkey made the attempt upon his life, and afterward we visited the spot where this attempt was made. The house is one of those fine old picturesque English mansions, surrounded with venerable trees, and presents an air of hospitality which is seldom met with except in the English country houses. The grounds are extensive, and are beautifully and tastefully laid out. A large library and a fine collection of paintings add much to the attractions of the place. Father intends to remove the paintings and library to America, so that you will have an abundant opportunity to see them. When we arrived here, the servants were perfectly wild with joy, and old and young clung around my father as if crazed. One old man and his wife, a son and daughter, whom he intends to bring back with us, I thought exhibited the most feeling I ever witnessed upon a similar occasion. This old man and his wife, my father tells me, were servants of his father's, and have been attached to the estate from their birth. They are the happiest creatures you ever saw, at the idea of coming home with us.</p>
               <p>"'This afternoon we rode out to the cliffs where that terrible scene was enacted which no doubt led to the remorse that killed poor Sharkey. When I stood upon the brow of the cliff and looked down into the roaring water far below, my mind was filled with wonder that the fall itself did not kill the good old man. But a kind Providence preserved him, no doubt for a wise purpose, and many a heart will be made glad that would have been clouded in eternal mourning, if this attempt had succeeded. The cliffs extend for miles each way from the point I allude to. My poor father must certainly have perished but for the almost miraculous circumstance of the appearance of the fisherman. This man is now living upon a small farm of his own, a present from my father, and is doing well and raising a thriving and happy family around him.</p>
               <p>"'My father has sold nearly all his real estate, and converted it into available means, for any purpose for which he may hereafter desire to use it. A very large amount is in the Bank of England, and the balance will be brought over and invested in America. I know nothing about the extent of his wealth, but it must be enormous; he has already sold some five or six fine estates with everything appertaining, and a splendid property in London. He has reserved from his fine stud of horses, four of the most beautiful specimens, of what they call here the "hunter breed;" one for you, one for Mary, one for Hugo, and one for myself, and he insists that we must all ride a great deal (as every one does here in England), as a necessary means of preserving health. Indeed, broad chests, rosy cheeks, and vigorous constitutions are here everywhere in striking contrast with the narrow, hollow breasts, stooping shoulders, sallow, cadaverous complexions, and loose gait,<pb n="404-405" xml:id="VAC6567-00000203"/> which, alas! we find so common among <emph>our</emph> people—as the wealthy Mr. ——, who, after the vital principle has been almost destroyed by a life of violence to all the laws of nature and of health, is driven out upon the Fifth Avenue, or up and down Broadway in his elegant carriage, with his servants in livery, to <emph>air</emph> his dried up carcass—which is nothing but carcass, the soul having long since departed.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Kate, when will our countrymen appreciate the great mission of America, and cease to become the mere apes of foreign vices and follies! When will Americans understand that they have it at their own option whether they become the greatest in arts, sciences, literature, and mechanics; and that they have the means within themselves to accomplish in each of these greater results than have ever been accomplished by any nation on earth! It will not be while low pot-house bullies and ignoramuses figure as Congressmen and legislators; it will not be while the American citizens permit such vile blots upon their national character to do their thinking for them; it will not be while the American sits quietly down, folds his arms, and thinks God has done everything for America, and therefore he has nothing to do; it will not be while young men are educated to be swindlers, and young ladies walking advertisements of millinery; it will not be while everything intellectual, everything refined, everything ennobling must be enjoyed in secret, for fear of giving offense to the national characteristic (love of money), and gaining for one's self the reputation of an idler.'"</p>
               <p>"Your father speaks bitter truths, Mary," said Hugo, when Mrs. Grattan had ceased reading; "but he is in a situation where no man, or set of men, can rob him of his bread-and-butter for doing so; and if his views were made public, I have no doubt they might do a great deal of good."</p>
               <p>"Or secure him a ride on a rail from those who differ with him," said Mrs. Grattan, smiling.</p>
               <p>"I can not believe it possible that the world is so bad," Mary exclaimed, earnestly; "and you, Hugo, must not think so. Father's experiences have made him think sadly of the world, and I hope his opinions are not of very general application."</p>
               <p>"Hope on, Mary! it is better to hope than despair, wherever the truth may be," Hugo replied; "and I confess that, although my experience so far has confirmed your father's opinions, I must still continue to hope with you."</p>
               <p>Thus the three conversed happily upon subjects suggested by their several letters, or by their own happy hearts, until late in the evening, when Hugo took a light, and, bidding the ladies good-night, ascended to his little bedroom, to sleep and dream of a happy future. Here he found everything arranged by hands prompted by a loving heart; bouquets and vases of flowers and shrubs; books and periodicals arranged upon the table should inclination prompt him to read; pencils and sketching materials, if his thoughts should wander into the realms of fancy, where artists generally live. A bed with snowy pillows and sheets wooed him, however, so effectually, that everything else was soon forgotten in the soft embrace of Somnus.</p>

               <head type="sub">WHAT MIGHT BE TOLD AS A SEQUEL TO THE STORY—THE SUNSHINE FOLLOWS THE STORM—MR. BLANC ANOTHER MAN—LESSONS HOPED TO BE IMPRESSED.</head>
               <p>EVERYTHING must have an end. And although we might dwell with pleasure upon many scenes and incidents which would be likely to occur in the interval of time we propose to pass rapidly over, yet we shall bring our story to a close in this chapter. We might entertain the reader, pleasantly perhaps, with accounts of delightful rambles in the neighborhood of Denwood, where Hugo and Mary whiled away the greater part of the day following the scene we have just recited. We might tell of the pleasant Monday morning ride, in the family carriage, with Joe Tyson on the box, as happy as any of the "insides," when Mrs. Grattan (who already came to look upon Hugo as a son) and Mary accompanied him to the little village, where he took the steamer to return to the city. We might chronicle in detail the incidents attending the arrival of Louise, and the happy, laughing, "joy-laden hours" spent in interchanges of bright hopes by these lovely girls, and the bright pictures which their fresh and youthful imaginations painted of the future; how lovingly they walked, each with an arm circling the waist of the other, to every accessible point of interest in the neighborhood; and how already their common salutations were "sister Mary" and "sister Louise." We might tell, too, with what interest Louise dwelt upon Mary's graphic descriptions of the generous and noble-hearted Byrnie, and how she always, at the close, "wished she could see him;" and again, when this wish was expressed, how Mary would playfully pat her under the chin, and with a look full of mischief, exclaim: "Look out for your heart, Louise, when you <emph>do</emph> see him." And we might, out of all this material, weave a most pathetic tale of love, and prove that hearts so congenial must have been united in heaven, where, it is said, matches are made.</p>
               <p>We might tell you of another Saturday visit from Hugo and Byrnie, bringing with them letters from England, which made it quite certain that the following Saturday Grey and Grattan would be with them. We could (perhaps) give you a thrilling picture of the happy meeting between brother and sister, so long and so cruelly separated, and of the delightful hours spent in introducing Louise to new scenes and localities, full of romantic beauty, about Denwood; and the visits to the Mountain House, the Kauterskill Falls, the Sylvan Lake, the Clove, and many other places familiar to the summer tourist. We could divulge conversations (known to no one else) between Louise and Byrnie which caused palpitations of the heart to both, and we could pause pleasantly together, reader, upon various little incidents which made these happy hearts, if possible, happier, and rendered their attachments, by greater intimacy and closer acquaintance, stronger and more enduring. We could tell you how delighted Hugo and Mary each dwelt upon every word uttered by the other, and how often Louise thought to herself—"They are certainly made for each other."</p>
               <p>We could go back with Hugo to New York, and I could introduce you to the daily visitors at his studio, and could write down the character and caliber of each. We could tell you how the heartless, soulless, unideal, commonplace Dalpoodle, an embodiment of fact, talks to him of the importance of the cultivation of fancy, cherishing the ideal as a preventive against acquiring notions too practical, of the admiration he feels for himself and his pictures, and how many he would buy "if he only had the loose means from other<pb n="408-409" xml:id="VAC6567-00000205"/> engagements." We could tell you how often the greasy Gamble called, and how his admiration of a picture, like that of all of his class, generally commenced and ended with the frame; and we could tell you the precise number of times, upon each visit, he used the terms, "fine effect," "great breadth," "pearly tone," "magnificent handling," "wonderful facility," "impasto," "chiaro-scuro," etc., etc., which, in common with many of our Art critics and connoisseurs, as well as editors, he utters with about as clear an understanding of their meaning as the parrot when he says, "Polly wants a cracker."</p>
               <p>We could tell you of another class of visitors, who are attracted by pictures rather than frames, who praise judiciously what is worthy of praise, and censure only to benefit the artist—to whose remarks he listens with respectful deference, knowing well that they speak and act from appreciation, which comes of love; and we could tell you how insensibly he is drawn toward these men, and with what a warm greeting they are always welcomed.</p>
               <p>We could devote a chapter to the incidents connected with the return of Grey and Grattan, and the curiosities and wonders they brought with them—the splendid collection of paintings, the statuary, the library of choice and rare books upon every conceivable subject, which were all duly placed in the new gallery and library at Denwood. And then we could fly with you, in imagination, over hill and valley, upon the back of one of those noble hunters, which the excellent Grey, ever more mindful of others than of himself, has brought from England for the use of his family; and as we rode along we could point out to you the warm glow of vigorous health in the cheeks of our companions. We could ask you to mark how constantly Hugo was at the bridle-rein of Mary whenever her horse became restive, and could tell you to note, especially, how perfectly rapt our friend Byrnie is in every word and movement of Louise, and ask you whether you did not think there was a mutual feeling of interest growing up between them which would yet lead to something?</p>
               <p>We could tell you of the arrival at Denwood of Mr. and Mrs. Blanc, and Doctor Draper, and we could note together the gradual change which took place in the character and feelings of Mr. Blanc. Then we would not overlook a little scene which occurred between Mary Grattan and this gentleman—how she pressed him to walk with her one evening, and after leading him through mazes of winding paths, which ramified in every direction through the beautifully shaded grounds, how she seated him in a little arbor, and handed him his own letter to Hugo to read; how she stood watching him until he had finished reading it, when, as the tears stood in her eyes, she grasped him by the hand, and looked him artlessly and affectionately in the face, and exclaimed, "Dear Mr. Blanc, please do not be so severe toward your noble-hearted Hugo, who, through all his trials, has never ceased to respect and love you as a father!"</p>
               <p>We could devote a chapter to telling you the process by which the heart of the stern practical man was softened, and how the affectionate disposition of the girl melted him to tears, and how he embraced her enthusiastically, exclaiming "that she was an angel; that he himself was a brute; that after a lifetime spent in misdirected aims, unsatisfying ambitions, and heart-corroding cares—he had but now learned how to live—he had but now learned where to go for true happiness. You," he added, "have taught me that beauty is something—refinement is something—ideality is something—that charity is real—love is real—sympathy is real—and that without these, all the gems of Golconda can not procure happiness." We could then tell you how Mr. Blanc and Mary both wept in this silent little arbor, and how, after an hour, they returned together to the house, much wiser, much better, much happier than they left it.</p>
               <p>We could tell you of the elegant improvements which were added to the new home; of the fine cottages that were built for the tenants; of the beautiful property purchased in the neighborhood by Mr. Blanc, and his final removal there; how Joe Tyson, from simple coachman, was gradually promoted until he finally became Mr. Grey's principal manager, and was<pb n="410-411" xml:id="VAC6567-00000206"/> intrusted with full control of much of his most important business. We could devote a chapter to a recital of the diligent and determined exertions of Mr. Grattan to place the fine arts upon a better footing by aiding every effort for the education of a public taste, and the delicate kindnesses he lavished upon deserving artists in every part of the country. We could show you the array of talent and genius which surrounded him, and could introduce you to many a delightful and instructive reunion of such spirits beneath his hospitable roof. We could also entertain you with the mortifications of the spurious would be men of taste and refinement—the painted apes, the fawning sycophants, the money-made men without brains—and how naturally they shrank from such an atmosphere as now surrounded Mr. Grattan, and how bitterly they did launch forth their invectives among themselves. We could show how the character of Mr. Grattan gradually changed, and how imperceptibly his youthful feelings, spite of all his fears, were eventually reinstated, and how his bitterness and misanthropy were replaced by active and energetic exertions to remove the evils which hang with such a depressing and almost hopeless weight upon the prospects of national Art.</p>
               <p>We could paint for you another scene which should be the climax to my story. In this the minister of the sacred gospel officiated, and formally united two hearts that had long been one; and we could follow this up with descriptions of the round of festivities which followed as a matter of course; and with an account of the final trip to Europe, where our hero won undying laurels in his profession, and, returning to his native country, devoted his talent and his means to the advancement of Art, opposed by a tide of adverse and discouraging influences, against which he could make little progress.</p>
               <p>All these things we could tell, but we shall leave it to your imagination, dear reader, to fill up all that may to you seem wanting in this concluding chapter, satisfied, if our poor efforts shall have the effect to bring up into life from a "living death" one single individual who is now wearing out his physical and mental powers in the vain pursuit of wealth as the only good, which, when attained, unless accompanied with taste and refinement, can yield none but coarse enjoyments.</p>
               <p>If such are led to believe that artists of every class, as well as tradesmen, merchants, lawyers, doctors, mechanics, etc., were thought of by the Almighty in his original plan, and that they have a mission to perform as well as these, in which it is a duty to aid them to the extent of one's ability, we shall have done more than our most sanguine wish could have led us to hope.</p>
