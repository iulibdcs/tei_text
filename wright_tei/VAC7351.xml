Preface to the Last Days of Pompeii.    10'CA'NAL STREET.    &#xD;<pb n="0" xml:id="VAC7351-00000002"/>  THE    HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE. CHAPTER I. O, THE SWEET SOUTH.  By W. GILMORE SIMMS.  O, the sweet South! the sunny, sunny South! Land of true feeling, land for ever mine! f I drink the kisses of her rosy mouth And my heart swells as with a draught of wine, She brings me blessings of maternal love; I have her smile which hallows all my toil; Her voice persuades, her generous smiles approve, .  She sings me from the sky and from the soil! O, by her lonely' pines that wave and sigh! i, by her myriad flowers-that bloom and fade!  By all the thousand beauties of her sky, And the sweet solace'of her forest shade, She's mine-she's ever mine- Nor will I aught resign Of what she gives me mortal or divine; Will sooner part With life, hope, heart- Will die--before I fly,  &#xD;<pb n="2-3" xml:id="VAC7351-00000003"/> 2    THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; O! love is hers-such love as ever glows In souls where leap affection's living tide; She is all fondness to her friends-to her foes She glows a thing of passion, strength and pride; She feels no tremors when the danger's nigh But the fight over and the victory won, How, with strange fondness turns her loving eye In tearful welcome on each gallant son! O, by her virtues of the cherished past- By all her hopes of what the future brings- I glory that my lot with her is cast, And my soul flushes and exulting sings She's mine-she's ever mine- For her will I resign All precious things-all placed upon her shrine; Will freely part With life, hope, heart Will die-do aught but fly! AT the time this story begins, there was situated, a few miles below  the city of New  Orleans, a magnificent chateau, on a large and extensive sugar plantation. In front swept the bold Mississippi, bearing on its bosom the mighty ship freighted with cotton or sugar, or the lighter craft of some Cuban Dago, returning to his island home after his sale of fruits. Ships and vessels of all nations were plying the river, and the hum of voices and song of the sailor were heard at all hours, night and day. In the rear of the building lay, for miles in extent, the cane fields, whose verdure and undulations in the  wind resembled a heaving sea of emerald. Here and  there were seen the sturdy negroes, as they worked at - their daily labour, and in the background their cabins,  at whose door, after their tasks were completed, they  assembled to dance by the light of the moon or stars,  to the sound of the all-inspiring "banjo." All spoke of    OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.       3 happiness and repose, as well as of industry. The in- terior of this Southern home was not the less inviting than its exterior; it was built in a square form, inter- sected by halls of polished marble, and on either side were beautifully carved doors, entering upon suites of apartments, which an inhabitant of the Orient might feel rich in possessing. Statuettes lined the halls, and filled the niches of doors and windows, while little Dryads were seen peering from the richly wrought leaves of the carved staircase, which led to the upper apartments of the building. Everything bespoke the elegance and refinement of the possessor, to whom the reader will now be introduced. Seated in the library in an arm-chair was a gen7 tleman of about forty-five years of age. His classic head and face would have been a,study for an artist; though advanced in years, his hair was jetty black, and his flashing, dark eyes bespoke him a Creole of the sunny clime, in which we find him. Poring over a book with the intentness of a deep thinker, and with con- tracted eyebrows, he had sat for hours, until, startled by a soft hand placed on his own, he started and ex- claimed: "This you! my ybeautiful girl; have you come to arouse me from my dreams of ambition to the realities of my state, or to chide me for spending my time in reading of the heroines of romance, when there are those around me rivalling far in excellence and beauty anything that history affords us?" "Ah, no; the first I would not rouse you from, for mny own soul soars aloft on the wings of ambition, and [ feel that within me which, I am assured, did circum- B 2  &#xD;<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC7351-00000004"/> 4    THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; stances afford an opportunity, would give the power to execute deeds such as only a Joan of Are could dream of; as to the latter, I know your preference for the heroines of the ancient school, and am not willing they should lose any part of your admiration." "Possibly, then, my dear girl, you will soon have an opportunity of displaying the power to which you allude, and I may yet be so lost in admiration at the adventures and exploits of my darling ward, as to be' disgusted for ever with the tame heroines of romance." ' "Why think you so? Is there aught in the elements which forebodes a storm? Is the political heaven in a murky state, and do the Jupiters of our country forge the thunderbolts of battle?" "Alas, I fear that ere another month glide away, the clangor of arms will be heard amongst us, and the shrill bugle note will call to arms every honest citizen. And then will come the worst of all wars,-fraternal and civil conflict." "My soul, perfectly resigned, my dear guardian, will go forth to meet it. Too long, too long, indeed, have those fierce myrmidons of the North been allowed to make laws for us, to govern us, to teach our youth, and worst of all, to enter our homes, and bring, concealed under their sheep's clothing, the wolf's teeth, destined to gnaw out our very vitals. Yes, my dear guardian, come what will, I am ready to give my last cent to a cause so holy as that of our independence. Jealous of our wealth and happiness, they have sworn to exter- minate us, as sincerely as we are determined to be exter- minated ere they shall rule over us." "Yes! it is indeed too true," he answered; "we     OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.        5 have brought into our homes, and warmed at our fire- sides the serpents that, with renewed life, were to turn and sting us. But we must triumph; our's is the holy cause. The South will only rise when she is invaded. It is our determination to act on the defensive; and as South Carolina has already seceded, our own State will so6n be in rebellion against a government who places in the Presidental chair a negro president or defender. Would I were a Titan, to hurl him from where he sits, together with his adherents." "Yes, dear guardian, it is the base machination of a minister who, with a host of satellites, sit at his elbow, and whisper in his uneducated ears their 6wn well- matured and fiendish plans. He is controlled by a crew of abolitionists, whose only grudge against the South is--slavery. Guardian, I feel that, woman as I am, I could seize a sword in so just a cause." Rising from his seat, he took the maiden's hand, and pressing it to his heart, answered--"My dear Natalie, you would not be the grand-daughter of General de Villerie, did you not feel thus; and I have no appre- hension that should it at last come to a conflict between us, that the girls and women of sixty-one will not be behind those of seventy-six in deeds of daring and courage; though your Southern blood rises in all its vigour, I feel that you are yet too much the woman not to wish for an. amicable arrangement of our diffi- culties." "Assuredly, you do me but justice in saying so; though I feel my spirit rise in defiance, my heart would bleed to think that a day would come when brother would wield knife against brother, father against son,   &#xD;<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC7351-00000005"/> 6    THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; son against father, and friend against friend; but should that hour come you will not see me shrink." "Well, adieu, Natalie, until my return from the city. I shall be absent to-night and to-morrow-I shall return and bring company with me; be prepared to meet them; and say to Madame Ernestine I shall expect such a welcome for my visitors and self as she can so well prepare, and which will do credit to herself and me." "Rest assured, all shall be as you desire, and with your permission, and to render your happiness more complete, I will ride over to Valambrosa and bling your fair friend home with me, that she, too, may be here to welcome you on your return. So, au revoir!" "a Au revoir, my dear girl." In another moment our hero was seated in his carriage on his way to the city, while his fair companion, mounted on a magnificent steed, with a groom follow- ing, dashed gaily down the coast. The young lady who has thus far interested us was the orphan daughter of Colonel de Villerie, and upon the death of her father was taken to the house of his earliest friend, Judge de Breuil, the subject of our story. He was the only son of an old French Count, and who, with an only sister, his senior by some years, were the sole inheritors of the plantation and grounds which have just been described, Miss de Villerie, on the death of her father, was brought to their home, and, ever since that event, had been the light of the household. Not very wealthy herself, she was not the less aspiring, and those around her, although possessing greater wealth, felt themselves when near her of less importance. Proud, high spirited,   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.       7 intellectual, and beautiful, she shone as a star of the first magnitude in every assembly, and was the observed of all observers. No relatives, she felt herself entirely alone in the world, but, her good sense and refinement caused her to look with feelings of love on those who had taken to their home the bruised flower and nourished it in their hearts. She was never so happy as when near her guardian and his gentle sister, and their hap- piness was ever, hers. We will now leave her to pursue her ride and turn to other scenes which will be described in the next chapter.  &#xD;<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7351-00000006"/> 8     THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; CHAPTER II. "THE SOUTHERN CROSS AND THE NORTH STAR." "Lo! the crowned virgin lifts her silver shield; From Alleghanian peaks resounds the strain, Let glowing freedom stand once more revealed Nor bend beneath the tyrant's yoke again. Better the sickle to the sword should yield; War's desolation mar the fertile plain; The ripened harvest rot upon the field- Far better than to wear the despot's chain.' From shadowy vales, from mountain summits bright Gleam the sharp lightnings of the Southern sword; Bathed in the warm meridional light, Symbol of faith and token of reward, Flaming aloft the Southern cross shall rise While pale Arcturus wanes in Hyperborean skies." SEATED around a dining-table in the salle-a-manger of one of the most stately and imposing private residences in Esplanade Street, was an assemblage of the most intellectual gentlemen of the crescent city. Though wine flowed freely, as it ever does at a Southern dinner party, there was no gaiety visible in the countenances of those who composed the company. The party con- sisted of four gentlemen. At the head of the table was seated the host, a man of about fifty years of age, small in stature, with a face the traits of which displayed   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.       9 no ordinary intellect; a quick, penetrating eye, that would seem to fathom the very soul, and a voice which could inspire a crowd with whatever feeling the pos- sessor might wish to convey. To his right, was seated one who was, by at least fifteen years, his senior, and whose countenance bespoke more of generosity and philanthropy than that of decided intellect; though it did not lack the expression of intelligence, it rather wore the look of genial kindness. Opposite to this gentleman was placed one who, for many years, had shone as a conspicuous member of the bar, but who had, in the last few years, retired to private life to enjoy the fruits of his labour. He had long been the brilliant orator and statesman, and was again, in the political emergency of his country, called forth from the privacy of his retreat, to lend, once more, his voice and counsel to his country's cause. His countenance was marked by a quick, shrewd, and haughty expression. The fourth party was one whom we have already described, and his visit to the city was for the purpose of meeting and discussing, with the- prominent men of the day, the state of national affairs. As the servitors waited on the guests, and poured out wine into goblets of Bohe- mian glass, the following conversation was carried on:- "My friends," said the host, " we are assembled to day for the last time, I imagine around a table of the Union; for, ere another month passes away, the tocsin of war will sound in our streets, be echoed in our vales, and re-eclhoed from the mountain tops of a Southern Confederacy. The hour is at hand when we must strike for our rights; when a nation consents to relinquish its  &#xD;<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7351-00000007"/> 10   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; independence it must take the consequences of its con- dition. It must obey the behests of a power to which it is subject; it must follow the dictates of a naster, or endure the stripes which are the penalty of disobedience. I ask you, gentlemen, will you calmly submit to servi- tude? Negotiation might arrest a war; negotiation might effect a peace. How to come to a negotiation, is the difficulty. According to our theory, a way is open, to a common basis, upon which the parties might nego- tiate, but Northern theory has excluded the very possi- bility of a basis. It places both the North and the South on as entirely different planes as Hades and Elysium. It has left a chasm, between which nothing but hate can fathom, and nothing but war can pass." "But," said the gentleman to the left, " if the South were even to compromise her theory, for the purpose of meeting the North in negotiation, the expedient would defeat its own object, for the moment she yielded one jot of her theory, she would, by her own confession, lose her national character, and pass out of the pale of diplo- matic intercourse. On the other hand, the Northern theory would seem to be essential to the very existences: of the Lincoln government, or it might be said, perhaps, of any government at all in the North. Nothing, indeed, at this moment, appears to stand between what there is of government left in the North and a whole legion of revolutionary demons, save the pending war with the South, Lincoln must fight for the life of his government. He must labour, or seem to labour to crush out rebellion, restore the Union, or, in other words, to satisfy the arrogance, the rapacity, and the complex fanaticism of the dominant party in the North; or, must confront   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.       " the certainty of being himself overthrown as the head of the government. War will be the issue, and war to the knife let it be. It may be, that we shall never see the daylight of peace breaking through the clouds and darkness of war, until the last remnant of Federal government has passed away, and the last Bruce or Wallace has slept with their fathers.   But be the end as it may, let SECESSION be our guide and watchword, and, until our independence is achieved, let not a voice be silent, but let our determination to be free ring abroad, as did the cry of our forefathers, when, crouching beneath the English lion, they broke the chains which fettered them; and may our efforts be as glorious and successful." "Yes," replied the individual to the right, " let our watchword be SECESSION and Independence, but let it be done peaceably, if possible; if not too late, we may yet arrest the progress of that fatal demon-war, and spare the lives of thousands, ay, millions. We sit calmly, in our council chambers and discuss the liability, possibility, and necessity' of war, but we little think of the misery it mill entail on those who will be compelled to fight your battles. The clouds are not, as yet, all lowering. I perceive one bright spot in the horizon, and we may yet reach the shade of its protecting shelter, ere the thunderbolts burst over our heads and leave us exposed to the storm of violence which is agitated in the political horizon of both parties. God forbid, that I should live to see this glorious Union dissolved, that my forefathers had fought, bled, and died for, whose flag, waving over all seas commanded the respect of all nations, and whose influence, none could deny.

America was the mother of the exile and home- less emigrant, America the mother, the impartial mother, who received, with outstretched arms, her children from every clime. Pause, my kind friends, ere this step is taken. The shades of our forefathers rise up to warn you, to entreat you to pause, ere our mother lies bleed- ing at your feet, and your matricidal hands are steeped in her blood. Will you look calmly on, and take no effective means to redress such evils?" "Shall we, sir," exclaimed the third party, "bend our backs to the lash of insolent would-be masters, and, helot like, receive the chastisement of these Romans- Romans only in cruelty? Shall we go on in this course and not take effective means to redress such monstrous evils, shall we forfeit self-respect, abase ourselves in the eyes of posterity, or shall the South, thoroughly aroused to the necessities of her case, insist upon war to settle our difficulties?" "Sir, do not deem that I wish to see our country humiliated, no sir, I am Southern, as well as you, and I believe I need not refer you to the pages of history to prove my ancestors no cravens. Their names shine on history's page, as brave and honourable, but humane men. I shall not presume, longer to speak of them, it is only to vindicate myself; my birth is Southern, my education is Southern, my family and friends are Southern; but with these sentiments come stronger feelings still, the feeling of philanthropy, which forbids my desire to see the blood of the human race flowing in streams from the sanguine altars of Moloch, when it   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE,      13 might be arrested by those who rule at our seat of government. Yes, I am Union now, Union ever, but the South must have my defence, my assistance, should ' Greek meet Greek.'" "You speak, Sir, as a Christian and a Southerner," said the host, "but there is no aid that is human, to avert this war. Have we not foreborne until it has ceased to be a virtue ; are we not looked upon, already, thy other nations as the footstool of a greater power. We are deemed, Sir, but another Ireland or a Poland. A press, which has pretended to be Southern, is found not only to applaud the doings of our enemies, but, also to direct its slanders against those who adopt a patriotic course. What wonder is it, that we should sink in the estimation of other nations. Has not the South ne- glected to employ her instrumentality in the production of native, vigorous, healthy, loyal institutions; and, has she not, thus far, apart from local politics, depended on foreign nations for her reading? to pause would be for her to manifest a fatal hesitation; and has she not doomed herself to dwell amid the defilements of a detested past, and to famish in arid plains, to feed on Dead Sea apples? but she is now about to break her bonds. She is now standing on the threshold of a glorious, mysterious, and wonderful future. Beneath the rainbow arch of hope that spans the dreadful cloud of war, her gateway lies, her path extends; but she must not hesitate, she must not cast one regretful look upon the doomed cities of the plain, under peril of being petrified upon the spot, to remain a melancholy monu- ment of national suicide." "To the future we must look," replied the person to  &#xD;<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7351-00000009"/> "   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; the left, "our past relics of pride and greatness, a patriot would blush to gaze upon." "But, sir," said the host to the fourth party, "you have not, as yet, given us your opinion; you sit a silent listener. What are your sentiments?" "Mine, sir," said the person addressed, " are those of the South in general, or that of every true Southerner. Lincoln went into the Presidency with the declaration on his lips that the Union could not exist, half-slave and half-free, and, he called to the chief places in his council the Northern politician, who proclaimed an irrepressible conflict between slave labour and free labour, which no constitutional provision and no state measures could withstand. I now state that the only condition for peace which any part of the South will consent to, is that of final separation from the North and acknow- ledgment of complete independence; that wars to resist and force unwilling millions into connection as subjects with a government they have deliberately denounced, will be a gigantic folly, as well as an enormous sin. Abolition has taught its children to curse the South, to abhor the slaveholder. Could so saving a principle be sedulously inculcated without, at the same time, carry- ing along with it a group of destructive instincts and venomous propensities, that would annihilate all that is beautiful, truthful and good? Abolition, with its capa- cious mouth, has swallowed up everything. In that one idea, all self-culture, virtue, and intelligence has been neglected. What abolition has sown, that also must it reap. Its manifold crimes against society and mankind have been heinous and unnatural, its retribution must be equally so. The South, when she once shakes the dust   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.        15 off her feet, will never enter the gilded portals of the union again. She is confident in the glorious destiny that awaits her, and feels her mission to be one of ex- tension and conquest, and will stand alone and unaided. It may be years ere the trial is ended, but, aught that can be urged to the contrary, is as nothing in the way of her determined will. To-day we know that in every Southern state the cry is 'Secession," and many more suns shall not rise ere the Confederacy will be organised. South Carolina, with all the spirit of its Irish ancestry, has sprung, armed cap-a'-pie, from the head of the re- volutionary Minerva. She shall not go forth alone; but what think you of our navy?" "Sir, our navy is as nought, in comparison witlh that of the North. In fact, we possess none; but then  we will be acting on the defensive. Our ancient foes possessed all the arts and implements of warfare, but, being the aggressors or invaders, were defeated. Rest assured, they will find us equal to the emergency, and when all our Southern officers shall have left them, they will have little to boast of in a naval point. Then let Secession be the watchword of every true, Southerner," exclaimed our host; "and now, gentlemen, we will cease this discussion for the present, and enter the drawing-room, where you will find the ladies, with whom you will, no doubt, be pleased to discuss other topics." "Union, Sir, is my motto, and will ever be so. Nevertheless, I shall lend my assistance to the South," exclaimed our distinguished and philanthropic friend.

"Yes, Madame, my ward, as well as myself, I believe, is prepared to rise and don the sword and buckler in defence of our country; and, I doubt not, she could almost lead an army herself against the foe." "Ah, indeed," exclaimed Madame S--, "is she so determined and patriotic? If she were not so beautiful, I should fear her offering herself as a sacrifice on the altar of her country, something on the Joan of Arc style; but from what I know of her, I would say she will be more prudent, and offer sacrifice on the altar of Hymen." "She is a noble woman, indeed, and happy the one who will call her his," exclaimed Mr. R . "By the way, Judge," said Madame B   , "we learn from the best of authority (which, of course, you know, is Madame Rumour) that your ward is soon to be led to the altar by the elegant Lieutenant Belden. May I ask, Sir, if there is any truth in the report." "As you have received your information, Madame, from so reliable an authority, my gallantry does not permit me to contradict a Madame, so I shall have to refer you to Miss Natalie for particulars." "Ah, Judge, you are very severe, at all events. I did not give credit to the rumour, as Lieutenant Belden is a Northerner by- birth, as well as by education, and I am sure that, with her high principles, she would never consent to wed one of our enemies. No, we cannot   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.       17 consent to see our beautiful flower borne from us. She must wed one of her own clime."       I! "It is unhappily the case," answered Madame S --, "that our Creole young ladies are, most generally, in favour of the blue-eyed, fair-haired sons of the North, and that, vice versa, the Creole gentlemen admire Northern beauty. But should a war take place be- tween us, it will end such relations between them for years to come, and I shall be only too happy to know how soon it may be the case." The conversation was here arrested by the entrance of the usher, bearing, on a silver waiter, a card, which he delivered to Madame S  . Glancing at the card, she remarked, "Usher the lady in," at the same time, turn- ing to her guests, she said, "Those amongst you who have never met before the elegant Madame N   , of New York, will have the pleasure of seeing her now." As she ceased speaking, there entered a lady, gorgeously attired, of a commanding person, but not, what we of tlhe South would even term handsome. Madame S    advanced to meet her, and, after their salutations were over, turned, and  in a most graceful manner introduced her to the company. " I have called to make my parting adieus, Madame S  , and I am happy to find some other of my friends with you, as my time is limited, and I might not have the pleasure of seeing them ere my departure for New York." "Then do you leave us so early," replied Madame S  , "you have, generally, remained much longer with us, and have often spent a portion of the season at our summer resorts." a  &#xD;<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7351-00000011"/> 18   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; "Yes, such had been my intention when I came South, but our difficulties have thrown up a barrier between us and enjoyment. That hissing word, Secession, whose very sound would suggest the proximity of a serpent, is the only thing to be heard in your city, and there is not even the common courtesies of life exhibited towards any save those who utter Southern sentiments."  "I am sorry," replied Madame B  , with a smile, "that your stay should be rendered so unpleasant, but, at the same time, must inform you that you are address- ing Southerners who are quite as devoted to that un- pleasant word as you are against it, and though to you it may suggest the proximity of a serpent, to us it is only like the brazen serpent which Moses erected for the Israelites. We will only have to look upon it to be healed, and, like the Psylla of ancient times, we are proof against the venom of serpents; were it not so I  fear, my dear Madame, your Northern reptiles would have exterminated us long ago." "My dear Madame N    ," exclaimed ]Madame S   "I am sorry that our city is not more agreeable, but I dare say that, during the present state of affairs, a Southern lady in New York would not be any more agreeably situated when listening to words such as union, abolition, &amp;c." The gentlemen who conversed apart were amused at the conversation, and Judge de Breuil hastened to remark, with all the courtesy of a true Southerner,  "Madame N   , you, of all persons, I should say, have the least cause to think harshy of us. I have ever deemed that you had received so manyfetes, and met with such flattering attention, during your visits here that we had   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      19 almost won you to our cause. I trust, however, we shall meet in better and happier times. So, wishing you I bon voyage,' I will now bid you farewell." With a graceful bow he left the room, followed by the other gentlemen. Madame N   ,after several bitter vituperations, took leave, and there was not one of the party who regretted her departure. She was one of the Jellaby sort of women, the only difference being that she hwd wealth to assist her in disseminating her ideas. She was one of that style of wealthy, ill-dressed, ill-bred Northern aristocrats who fill our hotels during the winter, and who, through courtesy, are invited to the homes of our planters, and then return to the North to write of "Legrees " and "Uncle Toms."

"Know ye the land of the cedar and vine, Where the flowers ever blossom, the bees ever shine; Where the light wings of zephyr, oppressed with perfume, Wax faint o'er the garden of Gull in her bloom; Where the citron and olive are fairest of fruit, And the voice of the nightingale never is mute; Where the tints of the earth, and the hues of the sky, In colour, though varied, in beauty may vie, And the purple of ocean is deepest in dye " THE reader is now about to be introduced to another scene, one that may be seen at all times during the winter or spring in our clime. The air in the Southern States, or those bordering on the gulf, is fresh and salubrious. It fans the cheek with a fragrance borrowed from the aroma of deep green fields, which the frosty hand of winter scarcely changes. The forests stretch far away and are pictured in dark relief against the sky. The heavens seem rounded up in their sublime expanse of deep blue, in which the diamond stars appear to swing as it were on golden pendulums. As was said above, the breath of winter does not wither the dark and rich green leaf of the forests. The flowers are gorgeous and flaunting while the entire scenery of this boundless Eden reminds one of a flower garden on an ;                 ,   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.        21 extensive scale. Music of thousands of birds fill the air, and their variegated plumage, golden green and red, present a brilliancy of appearance which the most fervid imagination can scarcely realize.  The mocking-bird swings on the branches of giant trees that seem   to sweep their arms against the sky, while the Spanish. moss, swaying gracefully to and fro, seems like a morning drapery worn for the ancient owners of the land (who are in this region almost extinct), and re- calls to mind the beautiful lines of the Rev. T. Hemp- stead :- "There is a little tangled plant that grows, Within our Southern clime ; And in the fanning breezes hangs and flows Like flakes of hoary rime. "The red bird singing 'gainst the tassels grey, Presses her flaming breast; And tears, with her strong beak, the threads away, To weave them round her nest." All nature seems here to be offering her' incense to the great Giver, and here the boundless heart of Southern philanthropy seems flowing over with good vill and generous hospitality. The future of the Southern country is as glorious as ever were those of Italy or Greece, and her brightest and best days are but dawning. Her sun is but beginning to cast its early beams around, her noon will awaken    the world. In the midst of such scenery as has just been described was located the home of one who will figure conspicuously in this story. The house was adapted to Southern comfort, being a one-story building with a  &#xD;<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7351-00000013"/> E HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; verandah running round it, opening on which were windows descending to the floor. A spacious hall ran through the centre, on either side of which were situated parlours, library, and drawing-rooms; the right wing contained bed rooms and boudoirs, the left being devoted to the " salle-a-manger." In the front of the house was a large park, while, in the rear, a terraced garden displayed to the visitor flowers of every hue and clime. In the distance might be seen the negro quarters glorying in brilliant wlhite- wash, and almost hid beneath the vines which grew in front of each door-way, and which formed a pleasant shelter from the rays of the sun at noon-day. To each cabin was attached a little garden, in which the useful and ornamental vied with eac h other. Far away, as the eye could reach extended the verdant enclosure, by which fields, house, and cabins were encircled. The beautiful cherokee rose turning its tendrils, and forming a fence so dense that not even a bird could penetrate it, and reminding one of a rich mosaic brooch in a setting of emerald. Standing side by side on the steps of the mansion just described were three ladies. The eldest was about forty years of age, and from her fair hair, and yet un- wrinkled brow, you could easily perceive her to be a daughter of the North. The youngest, firom the great resemblance she bore to the former, might easily be recognised as her daughter; though her complexion and features were very like her mother's, she possessed that dolce-far-nzente air which is only peculiar to  native- born Southerners. Her face was round, childish, and artless. Her complexion, fair as a lily, with the rose   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.   tints blushing on her cheeks, while her long golden curls swept over her neck and shoulders in wanton disorder. Her figure was tall and slender; with hands and feet so delicately moulded that they would have served as a study for an artist. She was dressed in a riding-habit of dark-blue cloth, with a cap of blue velvet and black plumes. Her companion, the very opposite of this, was Miss Natalie, spoken of in the first chapter; she seemed like a very Diana, as, with whip in hand, and attired in a dark green velvet riding-habit, with a cap, the feathers of which floated over her shoulders, she stood awaiting, while the groom   brought forth two richly caparisoned horses. "Adieu, Mrs. Clifton," she said, gaily i " I shall keep your charming Cornie with me until you issue one of your stern mandates for her return, or until, at least, I can send her home under the protection of such an escort as shall prove agreeable to her." " I trust you will not keep her long; she is the light of Vallambrosa, and her voice, ringing through our halls, dispels somewhat the gloom whiclh weighs upon our hearts, when we permit our thoughts to stray outside the home circle." "Chere mamma,' replied the daughter, " I shall soon return to you; and say to papa, if either he or brother will come for me, the day after to-morrow, I shall most willingly return." Kissing her mother, she sprang into her saddle, and joining Miss de Villerie, their horses were heard clattering down the road through the park, and they were soon out of sight. As they rode onwards, &#xD;<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7351-00000014"/> 24   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; the following conversation, commenced by Miss Natalie, took place. "When I look around and behold our beautiful forests, noble lands, and. majestic rivers, I think how blessed we are in this lovely clime; but then, when my thoughts dwell upon what it may become, through the cruelty of an invader, my heart sinks within me. Look, Cornie, and see those sturdy negroes in the field; do they look much like what the fiends of Abolitionism represent? Well clothed and well fed; their songs are rising on the air in anthems of happiness. See, yonder, the smoke rising from their cabins where they rest after their day's labour is done. No care, no fear for the morrow. If sickness prostrate them, they are nursed and cared for; not like the poor white slave who toils without ceasing, and then, when illness prevents him from labouring, he is wretched at the thought at having to pay all his hard-earned money for the services of a physician or a nurse. Which is the happier, think you?" "Ah, my dear Natalie, to us who know the difference, of course, the former state is preferable, but liberty, you know, is sweet. The negro may imagine that to be free comprises all the necessary enjoyments of life; he knows nothing of self-reliance; and, almost in every instance, where freedom has been bestowed he was willing, after a very short time, to seek the home of his master, content to roam no more. Freedom, like many other things, palls upon his senses when he finds that it merely consists of independence, coupled with the necessity of supporting himself. My father, though a large slave-holder, whose very interest is in the South, is of my mother's opinion--that a means might be   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      25 adopted for their emancipation at some future day, which, if undertaken at the present, would involve the ruin of the whole South." "I fear, my dear Cornie, that your father has been biased in his judgment by your excellent mother, whose northern principles and education has prejudiced her too much, perhaps, in favour of the land of her nativity, and too much against the land of her adop- tion. -Such an advent will never arrive; God forbid it should. What, think you, would become of this beau- tiful land? Who would there be to till those large fields whose bosoms teem with the wealth of nations? And who, think you, would work beneath the tropical sun? They alone are fitted for it by nature. If no other feeling than that of interest would prevent my desire of their returning to their own land, the! feeling of pity for their condition, which in their own country is so degraded, would banish for ever such an idea. By ancient as well as modern writers we are told of their low state, morally and physically. They worship nought save reptiles, and, if we can believe statements made by men of science, they are, in themselves, only a higher order of serpent. Have you ever read Dr. Cart- wright's treatise? if not, I should be pleased were you to do so, as it will elucidate more clearly my remarks. If his statements have any truth in them, or any of those from whom he -quotes, then slavery has been, indeed, a mercy to them." "Yes, I have read his discourse; but O, Natalie, it would be terrible to entertain such a belief. If I imagined it was so for a moment, I could never consent to live surrounded by them."  &#xD;<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7351-00000015"/> 26   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; "Cornie, it is not in your power or mine to render their condition happier; but we should be content with the thought that God has willed it thus, and that we are carrying out the Divine intentions when we strive, in the manner we do, to ameliorate their unhappy con- dition. But, Cornie, here we are at home, and here comes the porter to open the gates for us." "Glad you come, Miss Nat'le, and how ee do, Miss Cornie; I was jist 'bout to go arter you.

Ere the old man had finished this compliment the young ladies had rode in and dismounted, and were exchanging salutations with their friends, who had come out to greet them. "Miss Natalie," said an elegant young gentleman, stepping forward, "I feared we were to be deprived of your society this evening, as the day was waning, and you had not arrived. 1 accepted your guardian's invi- tation to Rosale for the express purpose of seeing you, and enjoying a spirited conversation with you.", "I am most happy to see you, my kind friend; but before proceeding further, permit me to present to you my friend Miss Clifton. Miss Clifton, allow me to intro- duce you to Mr. La Branche." "And now, if you will excuse us," said Miss de Villerie, "we will retire and exchange our habits for more fitting attire, and then have the pleasure of rejoining you in a few moments." Bowing low, he left them, and our young friends ascended the staircase to their rooms, where we will leave them until their return to the salon.   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.        27 CHAPTER IV. "From life without freedom, say who would not fly? For one day of freedom, O! who would not die? Hark! hark! 'tis the trumpet! the call of the brave, The death-song of tyrants, the dirge of the slave. Our country lies bleeding-haste, haste to her aid; One arm that defends is worth hosts that invade." RECLINING on a divan, in the back parlour of Rosale, was a lady of about fifty years of age; her face was fair, and the bloom of earlier days was still visible on her cheeks, Her hair was silvered over by Time's frosty fingers, but her dark, clear, and penetrating eyes would have added a charm to one even younger. 'She was attired in a steel coloured silk, while her head was orna- mented by a rich barbe of pointe d'Alengon, fastened with pins of jet set in the Etruscan style. She pos- sessed an easy, self-possessed manner, while her voice had that distinct, but modulated tone of the well-bred woman. By her side was seated a young gentleman, to whomtlhe reader has just been introduced in the former chapter, while his friend, Count Beauharnais, was in a deep conversation with Judge de BreOil. "You will, I trust, remain with us some time, Sir. A person cannot be a judge of a country, its manners, customs, and institutions in less than, at least, a six o,.   &#xD;<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7351-00000016"/> 28   THE HEROINE OE THE CONFEDERACY; months' sojourn. There have been too many histories, books of travel, and such like, written on only a bird's- eye view of a nation." "This is my first visit to America," replied the stranger, " and, though I cannot see much in its institu- tions to admire, still, the courtesy of its people adds a charm to one's tour, and makes one love and respect them for receiving, with such open hospitality, the stranger in a foreign land. They seem to be perfectly unsuspicious, and receive one in a truly democratic style." "You are, possibly, mistaken in your judgment, Sir, of us, and draw your conclusions from our Northern friends, or rather, our enemies now. They are more enthusiastic than we, and receive, with out-stretched arms, any one who may present themselves bearing letters with any stamp of nobility or marque; but we of the South must be very well assured of a person's claim on society, ere he is introduced into our home circle. You do not find our Southerners making beasts of burden of themselves to draw the chariot of one even royally descended, much less that of a danseuse or prima donna, as was, and is, the case still, in the North. No, Sir, though we do not lay claim to any coat of arms, save those of nature's noblemen, every man in the South feels himself afiee-man, and that is more than I believe your kings, queens, or princes can say. Merit, with us, is the only nobility we acknowledge. You are well received, Sir, both North and South, not for the fact that you bring letters of undeniable marque, but for tile reason that your family is not unknown to us. We are quiet, unostentatious, but sincere people."   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.       29 "Yes, the difference of manner is very observable to a traveller," said the gentleman; i" but, to one who can linger but a short time in the country, the manners of the Northerners prove more agreeable. They seem to be warm-hearted and unsuspecting; and, if it be but ephemeral, it is like the ray which gilds the mountain- top, though it melts not the snow upon its summit, nevertheless, lends a charm, while it lasts " "And to complete the metaphor, I will add," said Judge de Breuil, "that, like the mist which floats around the mountain peak, obscuring, for a while, the snow on its summit, that reserve we 'bear towards strangers when we prove their worth, vanishes as imperceptibly as does the mist. Should you remain with us for any time, I trust you will leave us with the impression that, if not so democratic, we are, at least, more sincere, than the people of the North." The young ladies entering, the gentlemen rose to receive them, and, Albert La Branche introduced his friend, Count Beauhamais, to Miss de Vilerie, when the latter introduced her friend to the Count. Saluta- tions being over, the party seated themselves, and Albert la Branche, turning to Miss de Villerie, said- "Madame de Breuil," (which she was termed, in courtesy to her age,) " and myself have just been listen- ing to a long discussion on the manners of North and South, between your guardian and my friend. I'am sure the North will find a warm advocate in you, n'est ce pas." "Though I am no friend to the North, I am not, yet, so prejudiced in my opinions but to confess that there are many, very many great intellects and shining lights  &#xD;<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7351-00000017"/> E HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; amongst them, and some, too, that we might be proud to denominate Southern. Yet one who will claim the politics of the North can never be very dear to me." "Miss Clifton, may I ask your opinion on this all- engrossing subject? " said Albert la Branche. "My opinion is of very little weight," she replied; "but having relatives North, my views are, probably, not unprejudiced. I love the Union, and, regret that aught should have ever occurred to render its dissolu- tion necessary. We lived so happily together, all like one large and happy family, that I must say that I dread the hour which shall see us sundered; but my friend, Miss de Villerie prays for the separation as ardently as I do the contrary." "Ay, verily," said Miss de Villerie, "we will put it to the test. 'And say, as stern Elijah said of old, The strife now stands upon a fair award, If Israel's Lord be God, then serve the Lord: If he be silent, faith is all a whim, Then Baal is the God, and worship Him."' "South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Texas, have already seceded, and, to- day, we look for the returns of Louisiana," said Judge de Breuil. "Having so many friends at the North," said Miss Clifton to Miss de Villerie, "I should imagine that you would feel some pang at the impassable gulf which Secession will inevitably cast between you. Are there none whom you wish to retain as friends?" " Not one, I would sever my very heart strings, if I   thought they bound me to an individual of Northern principles. What! to kiss the rod that smites me. Never! No, never! I trust to-day will bring the news of our separation from our detested enemies." "I was not aware the ladies of the South were politicians," said Count Beauharnais, "but I perceive that Miss de Villerie is quite a strong one. I had imagined it was only the ladies of the North who ever expressed themselves on politics, and had supposed, that, into the sacred precincts of a Southern symposium such subjects were never introduced nor debated." "I am well aware, Sir," said Miss de Villerie, "the very exalted opinion most nations have of us. They imagine us to be entirely devoid of the fundamental principles of an education, with only a slight knowledge of accomplishments; that we do nothing; are, in fact, incapable of thinking for ourselves, and, worse than all this, they imagine that we dream our lives away in quite an Oriental style, and sip our cafe or eau sucre quite a la Turqite. We are indebted to our fair sisters of the North for this very flattering portrait. In future, we shall paint and draw   our own, even should we be considered somewhat egotistic for so doing." "They should employ you then to paint for all, Miss de Villerie. I think a better artist could not be found, but one so ardent and sincere as yourself on political subjects, would not be the less so in matters of love, friendship, or any feeling of the human heart. I do not think for an instant that you would cease to love one because his principles did not coincide with your own, or that you would yield up, on the altar of dis-  &#xD;<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7351-00000018"/> 32    :HEs HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; sension, the affection of years' standing, or the claims of an old friend." "Then, Sir, you do not judge me rightly; not because another's principles do not in everything agree with mine, but for the reason that those who affirm that the North is just in her course to the South, and that Lincoln is right in his determination to force her to remain in the Union, and by so doing to oppress us in the manner we have already submitted to. But hark! heard you that sound? Yes, there it is again. I am sure we have seceded, yes, again and again." "Miss Clifton," said the gentleman, " do you not rejoice with us." "1 No, no, I can never exult with you over this. To you the sound may be sweet, to me it is almost a death- knell, tolling the dirge of all I love. How very sad the booming of those cannon strikes to my heart." "Boom  on," said Miss de Villerie; "to me it is sweeter than the music of the spheres. Count Beau- harais, behold Miss Clifton, she is positively weeping." "I am  not weeping, my dear friend," said Miss Clifton, as she hastily brushed a tear away, which trembled on her eye-lid; " but tears will start involun- tarily when I behold the once triumphant flag of our country each day losing a bright star, and that too of the first magnitude. What to you brings joy, to me brings sorrow." As she ceased speaking, she rested her arm on a corner of the table, and bowing her beautiful head, whose golden curls swept over her, she gazed out into the dark, until you would have supposed, from her atti- tude, that she was holding converse with unseen spirits, and from the expression of her deep blue eyes, that she   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.       33 could read, on the defaced records before her, ie future of her unhappy land. Count Beauharnais seated himself by the side of Miss de Villerie, while Albert la Branche seemed rapt in an admiring gaze of Miss Clifton.  He at length approached, and, seating himself by her side, said, "Miss Clifton, you seem to be quite abstracted; will you allow me to ask what may be the subject of your meditations?" "Certainly. I was just thinking that when we shall cease to exist on earth, will our troubles end for ever, or is there still another and yet another world, where the good and evil passions of man shall strive for the mastery. If we are all, as Plutarch supposed us to be, each possessed of a good and evil genius, or, as the moderns have it, a good and bad angel, is it not a pity that the Evil One's counsel most generally predomi- nates?" "It is, indeed, to be regretted," added he, "that such is the case.  We are all born, or supposed to be, in the state of original sin, and our inclinations tend more in the direcion of evil than of good. From the time of our first parents' trespass to the present moment it has been the same. There seems to be more pleasure in doing evil than good. Unless we have been fortunate enough to have been morally educated, man's passions when not governed by sentiments of morality, are apt to lead him astray, and when once he does lose sight of his good angel or genius, they seldom meet again on this side of the grave." "Yes, it is too true," she replied, "that when the angel guardian takes leave of some poor wanderer, in this' D  &#xD;<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7351-00000019"/> 34    THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; vale of sorrow, or rather, when some misguided youth turns his back upon his monitor, or closes his ear to- his low but kindly whisperings, he nevertheless still follows on. Ever ready, should repentance come, to administer counsel, and to plead his cause with the King of Kings; it is seldom he is recalled, unless the dying struggle of some poor erring one summons him to his bedside at the eleventh hour, to offer some atone- ment to an offended Deity. There, even at that moment, the gentle guide is standing, his wings drooping over the couch of the dying sinner, until the last sigh is breathed forth when his earthly mission is ended; then, pluming his flight for heaven, he records the deeds of one whose footsteps he followed here below. It is a beautiful idea, that when all desert us, that there are two who sympathise with us, our Heavenly Father, and our good angel." "You cannot, certainly, Miss Clifton, have ever known such sorrow as would have caused you to seek sympathy from any source, celestial or terrestial." "Sorrows of my own I have never experienced, but sorrow for others' woes I have. I feel an interest in every one's joys and griefs. The poorest wayfarer on life's high road is one of God's creatures, and, as such, is entitled to my consideration. Oh! how I have sighed for some fair Arcadia, where all might live in peace and tranquillity, where no storms should arise to destroy the calm of life!!" "You desire, then, to inhabit some fair Utopia, where all would be perfect. I would say to you, then, dream on, fair dreamer, for this state of affairs can never be while the human race exists. Sir Thomas Moore   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.       35 wrote his work under the inspiration of some fair spirit of another sphere. The idea is sublimely beautiful, but would require creatures of a different species as inhabi- tants, totally unallied to the human race." The servants entering, placed before each of the guests small tables of rosewood, others served the tea in cups of Sevres china, while cakes were passed around in baskets of silver. The conversation now became general, when, tea being over, and the tables removed, the young ladies were called upon for music. Mr. la Branche arose, and, throwing open the piano, requested the ladies to sing a duette. "As   we can sing with more ease standing," said Miss de Villerie, "it would be better if Madame de Breuil would play the accompaniment for us." "Will you be so kind, Madame de Breuil, as to play for us?" said Miss Clifton. "Avec plaisir," said Madame de Breuil, and, rising she was escorted to the instrument by Mr. la Branche. "A votre service, mademoiselle." "What would you like to hear-something from Norma, or La Juif?" "The former, Miss de Villerie, as it is well adapted to your style," said Count Beauharnais. "I think you will do Norma justice, while Miss Clifton, will make a fine, imploring Adalgisa." Soon music filled the room, and the exquisite voices of our fair friends rose and fell in rich bursts of melody through the halls, while the moments flew on unheeded, as song after song was sung, and piece after piece exe- cuted. Madame de Breuil played with a  masterly touch, as did also the young ladies.

"Certainement; but I shall ask Miss de Villiere to sing the first, and I will sing the second." "Guardian only desires to hear you, Miss Clifton; I shall not break the magic of the spell your voice will throw around him by any discordant notes of mine." "Miss de Villerie, 1 should be delighted to have you sing with Miss Clifton, if she requires a voice to sustain her, but I am more anxious to hear it unaccompanied." '"Thus, you see, my dear Miss Clifton, I am formally dispensed with." "Allow me to turn your music," said Mr. la Branche; "what will you sing?" "Your favourite, if you wish." "Then sing your own, and that will be mine," he answered, bendmng over her. She softly and tremblingly struck the chords, and sang, in her most touching tones, "Ave Sanctissima." Her voice rose and fell like the sighing of a lost spirit, and the " ora pro nobis" died away in lingering cadence. When she ceased, there was not a sound,; silence reigned supreme. All seemed too rapt in the dying echoes to feel that she no longer sang, and ere they were aroused, our fair cantatrice had left the piano, and sought a seat in a retired part of the room." Miss de Villerie was the first who broke the en- chantment. Smilingly pointing to her guardian, who sat as though fearful to move, lest he should lose a note of the melody, she said, turning to Miss Clifton, "Behold thy work, fair syren."   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      37 "Thanks, many thanks, my dear Miss Clifton," said Judge de Breuil. "Your voice has lost none of its pathos since I last heard you. When 'I listen to such music as yours, I do not doubt of the power of Orpheus." Madame de Breuil, rising and bowing to the gentle- men, withdrew, followed by the young ladies; they retiring to their rooms to spend a gay hourn in discussing the events of the day, and then to sacrifice to the gods Somnus and Morpheus, while the gentlemen retired to the library to enjoy a cigar. As we have no disposition to know what they have to say, we will follow the young ladies, and, for your pleasure, reader, become eaves- dropper on this occasion, and will relate, as accurately as possible, their conversation. On entering the room, Miss de Villerie remarked- "Now, my dear Cornie, we shall discuss the gentle- men, as, no doubt, they will take the liberty of doing with us. How are you pleased with our young scion of nobility and my old friend Albert la Branche." "They are both so agreeable I can scarcely make a distinction." "Ah! it is useless to ask you for a decided opinion upon any subject. You are too grand a diplomat. I think Albert would be more candid, from what I was able to discover this evening. Cornie dear, you. opened the artillery of your charms upon him, and he surren- dered at once." "Natalie chere, you are cruel. If I were desirous to make use of the lex talionis, I do not think you would have much the advantage, but I shall be merciful. May I ask what you think of Count Beauharnais?"  &#xD;<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7351-00000021"/> 38    THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; "Most assuredly. What do I think-let m'e see. Rather a handsome Frenchman, air, tres distinguE, very much more modest and retiring than most of his country- men; not remarkably intelligent, but quite graceful in his manners, with a radicated sense of his position and aristocratic connections, with a very capacious heart, and your humble servant, if I judge aright, occupying the largest chamber in it this evening. To-morrow I shall abdicate (being the best policy, where a French- man's love is concerned) in favour of a more fortunate rival. Is this sufficient, or shall I be still more candid?" "Ma chere Natalie," you have been over candid, I assure you, but, as you are such an excellent delineator of character, draw a slight portrait, if you please, of Mr. la Branche." "Yes.  Albert la Branche, an elegant, high-bred, high-souled Creole, partaking in disposition and tem- perament of the tropical nature of the clime of which he is a native. Fiery and impetuous, generous and the soul of honour, devoted to friends, implacable to enemies, loving with all the ardour of a sincere nature: and now that I have finished the picture, I will give it to you to treasure in your heart of hearts." "Thank you for the gift, but I am scarce worthy of such a keepsake; but, Natalie, vraiment et entre nous, have you never loved any one, or do you, and have you ever treated your admirers as cavalierly as I have ob- served you to do on all occasions. Is there none who has ever made an impression." "Tres bien pour vous, my fair inquisitor, you have donned the priestly robes, and are prepared to hear and absolve, I suppose. Well, you deserve to have your   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      39 penitent make a clean breast of it, and now listen: the citadel of my heart was stormed and taken possession of the first winter of my debdt in society. The victori- ous general was one whom you have never seen, though he is not unknown to fame. He is a native of the far- off north, but I know he entertains no such ignoble sentiments as those by whom he is surrounded. I feel assured, when the war-cry rings from hill and dale, we will find him foremost in our defence. I know that he will never become the oppressor of the South." "Ah, ma chere Natalie, think you that he will yield for ever his claim upon home, friends, and kindred to become the champion of a cause in which he can have no interest, save that of his love for the daughter of a clime where everything in it is opposed to him and his except that one fair being. I am no logician, my dear Natalie, such is my opinion, and you will find your idol dust; if so, be not disappointed. He may love you ardently (and who is there, knowing you, that would not?) but, Natalie, he will never, no never, desert the cause he will espouse for any love, be it human or divine." "Then hear me, Cornie, the moment he becomes my country's foe he can no longer be anything more to me than any other invader of our homes and firesides, though I love him as I can never love other than my God, I would cast him from me, and the gulf of oblivion should for ever roll over every reminiscence of the past. I would offer my love, my burning, my first, last, and only love, as a sacrifice on the altar of my country. But this can never be, he is too noble ever to become an oppressor."  &#xD;<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7351-00000022"/> 40    TIlE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; "I trust, for your sake, dear Natalie, that he may be all you would wish him, but should ' a change come o'er the spirit of your dream' you will remember, often, what I have said to-night." Miss de Villerie, sounding a bell, a nice-looking ! mulatto girl answered the summons.  "Cornie, Vic- torine is at your service, 1 shall not retire just at present, when you feel disposed to do so, iact sans ceremonie." "I shall do so forthwith, and leave you alone in your boudoir, for I am anxious to seek my couch to revel in the land of dreams, while I leave you to think on the past and dream over the future. Bon soir," she whispered, bending over Miss de Villerie until her curls, like a veil of golden mist, enshrouded both. "Dans votre orisons souvenez vous de moi," and then turning to the maid she said, "Vien Victorine." Alone in her boudoir Miss de Villerie sat till long after midnight. As the damask curtains fell on the retreating form of Miss Clifton, our heroine threw herself at the feet of the statue of the blessed Virgin which reposed on an altar in the room, which served both as oratory and boudoir; long and fervently she prayed, her dark hair falling over her shoulders in artless confusion, and her large and dark eyes raised to Heaven, while her hands were clasped in an agony of despair. Her words were wild and stormy, and ran thus:- "Oh, God! who hearest thy suppliant, I beseech thee, if possible, to let this bitter, bitter cup pass from me; but, like thy Son, I too say, ' Thy will, not mine, be done.' Dark and dreadful presentiments fill my soul, but He, to whom there is nothing in Heaven or on   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      41, earth impossible, shield me from all ill and dash not to earth my brightest hopes.

Yes, Thou who rulest the heavens and earth, and who giveth victory to the just, art with us, Thy strong arm shall divide the sea of blood which will flow between the North and South. Thou wilt pass thy chosen people through its depths, and Thine arm shall be withdrawn and, like Pharoah and his hosts, our enemies will perish in the surging waves which shall pass over the last remnant of them. God of my forefathers, thou hast given me the gift to foretell the fate of our blindfolded enemies, and though, Cassandra-like, I should trumpet it forth, it would meet with a Cassandra-like reception. Not until the fire and the sword should have devastated and swept all be- fore them would my words find belief. The hour is fast approaching in which shall sound the clarion note of war; oh! in that hour remember the father, the mother, the sister, the brother. In that hour, oh, God! the father shall go forth from his family, mayhap never again ,on earth to behold them. The son shall go forth in the might of right, and his young blood shall flow upon the battle field, and his last sigh escape to Thy throne from his gory bed of death.

I, oh, Lord! am but a creature of a day, formed but to die, but not eternally. I am thy victim, do with me as thou wilt. If my young life would serve as a holocaust on the altar of my country, thou knowest, who readeth all hearts, how gladly I would yield it up an offering to thee and to my own beautiful sunny South and native land! Like the daughter of Jephtha, I would go forth to meet the victorious general and bless the hand that smote me.

MORNING found our party assembled around the break- fast-table discussing over their chocolate and caf6, the morning journals, which contained the news of the seceding of the State. The gentlemen were exultant while Madame de Breuil uttered her sentiments in favour of the act with her usual quiet dignity. Miss de Villerie's eyes sparkled with enthusiasm and all were joyous, save Miss Clifton. She was true to the union. "The city, I presume, will make a demonstration to-night in the way of an illumination," said Judge de Breuil. "Without doubt," said Albert la Branche, "and Judge, Count Beauharnais, and myself will be pleased to accompany you in your drive to the city this morning, as we are anxious to see and hear all we can."  &#xD;<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7351-00000024"/> '44   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; "My dear guardian, Miss Clifton and myself will also go this morning, as Madame de Breuil wishes to illuminate, we are to send out the necessary materials; and, if you have not forgotten, my fete to celebrate secession comes off as soon as possible. Miss Clifton and myself will spend the day in the city, giving the necessary orders and superintending the purchases." "Then I perceive, Miss de Villerie, that you are de- termined your sentiments on political subjects shall be blazoned forth?" said Count Beauharnais. "Most assuredly, Sir; I trust no one will deem me other than I am, a loyal Southern woman." "Ladies and gentlemen, the equipages await you," said a servant. The ladies retiring, in a moment returned attired in carriage costume, and rejoined the gentlemen, who were waiting to assist them to their carriages. "Miss de Villerie," said Count Beauharnais, as he placed her in the phaeton, "I shall long have cause to remember my pleasant visit to Rosale, can I hope the remembrance of it will be at all agreeable to you?" "Why should it be otherwise?" she answered, slightly colouring; "it affords me much pleasure to receive and welcome to my home all my friends, and as such I cannot but denominate any one to whom my old and well-b loved friend Mr. la Branche may introduce me, and will certainly be remembered by me with pleasure." "Then adieu for the present, Miss de Villerie," and springing into the carriage he sat awaiting his friend Albert la Branche. The latter, as he was taking leave of Miss Clifton   ua, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      45 said, ", May I hope to be permitted to call on you at your own home, and cultivate an acquaintance with one whom I am desirous to know more of?" "If a farther knowledge of myself is pleasing to you, I shall be happy to see you at Vallambrosa." "Then, with a hope of meeting at an early day, I bid you good morning." Bowing low to Miss de Villerie, he rejoined his friend, and they were soon driving rapidly up the coast towards the city. Madame de Breuil, with her housekeeper and maids, sat all day twining wreaths and triumphal garlands; arches of evergreen were made, and doors, windows, and gates were festooned, while japonicas and other flowers were suspended from pillar to pillar, which were entwined with evergreens. Evening came, and brought with it our young ladies. "Oh! how perfectly charming, Madame de Breuil," said the young ladies, in the same breath; " we have seen nothing throughout the whole city to compare with it; you may feel assured that your residence will be far more beautifully illuminated than any." "I think my design very pretty, as did your parents, who drove over this morning," said Madame de Breuil. "By the way, they desired me to say to you, that your brother would be over this evening, and that, if you chose, you could go home with him; though she did not leave it to your choice until, at my earnest solicitation, that if you wished to remain longer with Natalie, you could do so. I trust ybu will consent to remain with us and assist in issuing invitations for ourfete."

THE BEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; until everything is arranged for her entertainment. Will mamma illuminate, Madame de Breuil?" "Your father wished her to do so, but your mother, I believe, objected. Your brother will be here this evening, and will join with us in our demonstrations. He, I believe, is not of your sentiments." "Yes, my brother is a Unionist; but he has always said he would fight for the land of his nativity." "Ah! Cornie chere, your brother knows the just side, mais allons, there are many things to be arranged before night, and we have yet our toilettes to make, and let them be quite becoming, as my dear guardian seldom comes home alone." Night came, and saw the mansion one blaze of light -halls, doors, windows, and gates shone forth in all the brightness that two thousand wax tapers could throw upon the scene, while in every tree hung coloured lamps, and through the garlands entwining the pillars light shone forth and was reflected far out into the river. In the centre of the house, and over the door- way, on a ground of cerulean-coloured silk, shone lights representing the constellation of the Southern cross, and the emblem of the State embroidered in silver--the pelican and her young; while, in rainbow colours of light, shone the motto, "We live and die for those we love;" on the archway of the gate blazed the word "Secession," while the sparkling waters of the foun- tains throughout the grounds added their tinkling sound to the loveliness of the scene as they fell into their marble basins. All beauty and light without, while revelry and harmony reigned within. "You cannot conceive, Mr. Clifton, what a strong   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      47 Unionist your little sister is. I firmly believe that when the Union ship is beheld a sinking wreck, she will be found clinging to the mast." "My sister is -devoted to the cause, I know, as much so, possibly, as any strong-minded woman of the North; but, like many others, her birth was cast upon an evil time. She is no politician; she is guileless in the world and all that pertains thereto. You have drawn, Miss de Villerie, a very good portrait of my sister. Whatever cause she espouses, she will cling to it with tenacity, and where she loves, it will be with devotion." "Miss Clifton, if you have no objection, we would like to hear 'La Marseillaise,'" said Judge de Breuil. "Shall I open the piano?" "Yes, if Miss de Villerie will lend her voice to mine. and my brother and yourself consent to sing the chorus. Madame de Breuil, will you be so kind as to accompany us?" The latter was escorted to her seat by Beverly Clifton, and soon that soul-stirring air rang out and rolled in swelling numbers through the spacious halls. As the song ended, there were heard approaching voices, and the servant, entering, announced Colonel Leland, Madame Bienvenu, Hon. P. S  ., and Madame S  . "Rather late visitors," said Colonel Leland, as Judge de Brieul advanced to meet them; "but we were attracted by the beauty of your illumination, together with the singing, and we at once drove in to see and admire. We rode all round the city to-night, but they have nothing there to equal the beauty of this scene." e  &#xD;<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7351-00000026"/> 48   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; "I am delighted to see you, and thank you for the compliment, and am glad, as you have just arrived in time for supper. I see Victor coming to announce it." Bowing low, the servitor advanced, saying, "Supper waits." He remained standing to usher them in. The guests entered, and partook of a delightful repast, of which oysters, soft shell crab, mayonaise, with cham- pagne and old burgundy, formed the principal. "Miss de Villerie," said the Hon. P. S , " did you design this illumination? If so, it speaks well for your taste." "I designed it," she answered, " but it was arranged by Madame de Breuil." "How are you, my charming friend?" said Colonel Leland to Miss Clifton; "I am surprised to find you here this evening, and lending countenance to such a demonstration. Public Opinion deems yourself and family Unionists." "I was not aware, Sir, that ' Public Opinion' ever did us so great an honour as to think at all of us; but I am pleased, that when it did, it thought correctly, as is but seldom the case with that well-known busy-body. My family are Unionists, Colonel Leland, but they are, notwithstanding, Southerners." "The rockets are ascending, ladies and gentlemen," said Judge de Breuil; " will you walk out on the balcony, to have a fine view?" "Oh! how transcendently beautiful," exclaimed the whole party, as one after another they flew up into the air and exploded, sending out their meteor-like lights. "You have yet to behold the most charming sight," said Madame de Breuil; "but," she added, "I believe   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.       49 we will have the whole city with us," as carriage after carriage stopped in front, depositing their occupants at the gate, which entering, they sauntered through the grounds in admiring wonder. "Bon soir, ladies and gentlemen," said Albert la Branche and Count Beauharnais, as they sprang up the steps on to the balcony, where our party were standing. "We could not resist the temptation of driving out to have a view of this scene." "I assure you, Miss de Villerie," said Count Beau- harnais, "such a scene of enchantment would do credit to the taste of a Madame de Pompadour, and vies with any scene, I think, ever given at ' La Petite Versailles.'" "There is nothing that taste or art could suggest, Count Beauharnais," she answered, "but is worthy of the cause, for which this is but a feeble demonstration." "Miss Clifton, I had not hoped for so great a plea- sure as again meeting you here, and the enjoyment of. this evening will be greatly enhanced by your presence," said Mr. la Branche. "Thank you, Sir,' for your kind sentiment. But, hark! what is this?"The company all rose, as a most magnificent band was heard in the distance. Nearer and yet nearer it approached, until immediately in front of the mnansion were seen several beautiful sailing-boats. In the front were seated the musicians. The masts were wreathed with flowers, while lights, varied as the rainbow, threw a charm over the whole, far too beautiful for the power of description. Resting upon their oars immediately in front of the mansion, the band discoursed the most delicious strains, to the delight and amaze.- ment of the guests.

"If this is the prelude, Iam sure it will be a most magnificent affair; and, by the bye, I must not omit telling you of some distin- guished arrivals in our city. There is at Madame G---'s a most charming young lady. She is from Cuba, and spends a few months in our city. I trust Miss Clifton and yourself will call on her, and show her some attention while she remains amongst us. Her name is Senorita Inez Montijo. The other distinguished arrival is Lord Ethelred, a Scotch nobleman, whom, if you will permit, I will take pleasure in introducing to you." "-Myfete will come off as soon as I can issue invita- tions, and as I do not think I shall be aile to call on Senorita Montijo, I shall remember to drop her a card, nor shall I forget your other distinguished acquaintance." "I do not think, Miss de Villerie," said Count Beau- harnais, " that you will be able to forget him when once you have seen him, for he possesses the peculiar tact of saying or doing something that generally makes an impression." "I should not judge that you were very much prepossessed in his favour," said Miss de Villerie, smiling. "I cannot say that I am. He seems to possess that barbarian style of manners only fitted to the highlands of his own country. A lord he may be, and with right and title too, but a gentleman never." "You should not judge so harshy," she answered; "you know there are many rough diamonds." , Certainly there are, Mademoiselle, but we do not   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      51 wear them in the rough. They are left with the lapi- dary until such time as there is sufficient polish on them." "The lapidary, in this instance, Count Beauharnais, to whom this gem may have been entrusted, may have been unskilful. We are told that there is but one in the world at present to whom jewels of rare value can be entrusted, and this is, I believe, Coster, of Amster- dam, and I do not think a Scotchman would consent to a polish from a ' Hollandais. " "I shall not argue the subject further, but will await your opinion of the gentleman, and if it does not agree with mine, then Miss de Villerie will deceive me very much in the estimation I have formed of her judgment. However, to change the subject, would you like to promenade over the grounds?" "Yes; I have had but a contracted view of the whole scene this evening, and will walk out as far as the levee, and take a glance at the scene. Miss Clifton," she said, " will yourself and Mr. la Branche join us in a promenade to the margin of the river? The view, I imagine, is quite pretty from thence." "Most willingly," they replied; and soon their voices were lost in the distance, and their forms amidst the- mazy labyrinths of the shrubbery. While they pursue their walk we will return to the other guests. "Who is that distingue looking gentleman with your ward, Judge de Breuil?" inquired Madame Bienvenu. "He appears to be a foreigner."   a "It is Count Beauharnais. He has been here but a few weeks, having, as is the case generally with all visitors to America, paid his respects to the North first.

Ever comparing its buildings, its manufactures, its commerce, and institutions to those of the ancient world, forgetting that our nation is but in its infancy, and that, Hercules-like, it can now strangle in its infant grasp the monsters that would seek its destruction." "Yes," said Colonel Leland, "it is but too true that there are but very few who can look upon our country as it was, and as it is. To think, but yesterday, in com- parison with other nations, this vast country was but a boundless wilderness, and that too where foot of white never trod; where the Indian war-whoop rang through hill and dale; and that nothing larger ever floated on the surface of those broad lakes and rivers than the birch canoe of the savage. Behold it now! Palatial steamers ply our waters; and see yonder forest of masts, and then think of what we were and are. America, independent of the whole world, bears within her maternal bosom the teeming wealth of the globe. The seed of the old Puritan stock, dashed upon Ply- mouth rock from the Mayflower, has spread its poison- ing influence throughout our lovely land, and choked up and withered that purest of all seed, the seed of brotherly love. The latter can never blossom again; there is one pert of the nation where it has not taken root. The proper method shall be taken to prevent it from doing so." The young ladies returning to the house, the guests took leave, and as the gates closed upon the last stroller through the grounds, the band struck up the beautiful   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      53 air of "Farewell, farewell to thee, Araby's daughter," and soon the fairy boats were out of sight. Our heroine and Miss Clifton were up early the next morning, and after breakfast commenced their prepara- tions for the fete. The first thing to be done was to issue cards of invitation, and the two young ladies spent a greater portion of the morning in this employ- ment, while Madame de Breuil went from room to room superintending the arrangements. Victor was employed with his corps of assistants, and Mannassier in the con.. fectionery department. "Victorine," said Miss de Villerie, " tell John I wish him to deliver these cards." 'The servant withdrew, and soon returned, accom- panied by John, who bore a large, silver card basket. Miss de Villerie arranged the tickets in the basket, and, with an injunction to return as 'soon as possible, sent him on his way. "Young ladies," said Victorine, 'Madame de Breuil wishes to see you, in the library." "Come, Cornie, we must now assist in the upholstery of the arrangements." Upon entering, Madame de Breuil said to them, "I merely wished to ask you if it would not be well to partition the library into separate apartments, with hangings of damask, for card tables. The drawing- room being hung with green and gold, I thought I would make the partitioning for the library of crimson." "Where will you have the dancing, Madame de Breuil; not, surely, in either front or back parlour, it would ruin the elegant hangings?" "The devotees of Terpsichore will have the drawing-  &#xD;<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7351-00000029"/> "   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; rooms devoted to them, while the salons will be devoted to those who feel disposed to be merely ' lookers on in Verona.'" "But, my dear young ladies, if you expect to receive your guests at the appointed time, you must assist your- self, and Miss Clifton can order the arrangement of these hangings with much more taste than I. How unfortu- nate that Siebrecht could not come; possibly he may be here to-morrow." The hours wore on, and night fell upon the scene, when our heroine, fatigued by the labours of the day, sauntered forth to breathe the air, unattended. The moon shone bright and beautiful upon the earth, and robed each object in silver sheen. A little star trembled beside the moon, and now and then a dark cloud would roll over and obscure both moon and star. "Pale trembler!" said our heroine, ;' I, like thee, follow at a distance, in thought, a planet still more. lovely, for it is the image and likeness of Him who created thee. Sail on in thy unwavering course, thou beautiful moon! The little star is still beside thee. Dark clouds enshroud, but when they vanish, your little star is still seen following on.

"There is a festival, where knights and dames, And aught that wealth or lofty lineage claims, Appear-a high-born and a welcome guest To Othb's hall came Lara, with the rest. The long carousal shakes the illumined hall, Well speeds alike the banquet and the ball; And the gay dance of bounding beauty's train Links grace and harmony in happiest chain: Blest are the early hearts and gentle hands That mingle'there in well-according bands; It is a sight the careful brow might smooth And make age smile and dream itself to youth And youth forget such hour was past on earth, So springs the exulting bosom to that mirth!" "Lo! all the elements of love are here- The burning blush, the smile, the sigh, the tear." MORNING dawned clear and cold, but found all the in- mates of Rosale astir, each anxious to see the last or finishing touch given to the arrangements for the even- ing festivities. Siebrecht, with his corps of assistants, had arrived, and was arranging, with his usual taste, the hangings of the apartments.:  Victor and Mannassier were controllers of pantry and cuisine; and when evening with its purple tints fell upon the scene, it foumd all com- plete.   2'i  I::s  &#xD;<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7351-00000031"/> ,58   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; "Victorine," said Miss de Villerie, as she sat before her elegant toilette mirror, "I trust you will exert your utmost skill this evening, to render me as beautiful as possible, as I presume this will be our lastfete this season, and, mayhaps, for years to come." "Yes, mademoiselle, but it is impossible to contribute a ray to the sun." "Ah, Victorine, I permit not flattery, and now do your duty in silence." Her toilette complete, Miss de Villerie descended to the parlour, where she sat with her guardian and Madame de Breuil, awaiting the guests. Before their arrival, however, we will spend a few moments in a description of her attire, commencing with her coiffure,  which was arranged in a most becoming style. Her glossy black hair was braided on either side of her face in a massive, triple plait, while the back was caught up in loops with a diamond comb. In the left front plait, glittered a diamond star, while a chain of the same jewels, but of larger size, crossed her hair just a little above the forehead, and fell in a glittering festoon of light on the right side, and was connected with the comb in the back. She was attired in a rich crimson rep silk, with two deep flounces of rich Chlantilly lace. Her corsage was tres decolte, displaying her beautiful neck and shoulders to advantage, while her bouquet de corsage was composed of flashing diamonds. Her ear- rings, necklace, and bracelets were composed of the same, while in her hand she held a fan, which was literally covered with the same jewels, and which would have been envied by a Sultana. Madame de Breuil was dressed in a rich black silk   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      59 velvet, while her white, and yet well-rounded neck, shoulders and arms were covered by a guipure spencer. Her only ornaments were a lace barb of guipure fastened on the side of her still glossy hair by diamond pins, while her spencer was caught in front by a brooch of the same jewels.  Judge de Breuil, with his usual taste, was habited in a suit of black cloth, while a white vest and kid gloves completed his simple toilet. It was now the hour of ten, and the gates, thrown wide -open, admitted the carriages with their elegantly attired and fashionable occupants. Soon the parlours began to fill with as distingue looking a crowd as ever assembled in the halls of fashion. The lights of the chandeliers were softened by the lambent rays of six hundred wax tapers, and the blue and gold hangings and furniture of the front parlour, as also the white and gold of the back, shone like the starry vault of heaven, while the swaying crowd seemed like the galaxy. There was quite a stir in the assembly as Monsieur G--- , Madame G---, and Senorita Montijo were announced, and, though we have heard much of Spanish beauty, Senorita Montijo rivalled all that was ever seen or heard of. She was of the medium height, of a dark olive complexion, and black lhair, with large and flashing dark eyes. She was dressed in a heavy satin of pale straw colour, with over-skirt of rich white blonde. Her hair was richly braided with pearls, and gems of the same kind adorned her ears, neck, and arms. Her corsage, formed in the Spanish style, of satin and blonde, was fastened with a ceinture of pearls. She had the tread of a queen, and in her countenance was perceived the dignity and bear- ing of one who sprang from a noble race. She had all  &#xD;<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7351-00000032"/> 60   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; the grace of an Andalusian, with the perfect features of a Castilian. As she passed through the rooms, escorted by Monsieur G---, she was followed by crowds of ad. miring beholders. Soon music rose with a voluptuous swell, and soon the dance began. Albert la Branche led out the graceful Miss Clarendon, while Lord Ethelred sought the hand of the bewitching widow Bienvenu, who, though not beautiful, possessed that esprit which never failed to draw around her a gay and brilliant crowd of admirers. Judge de Breuil, with Madame S--, was the vis-a-vis of Colonel Leland and the beautiful Senorita Montijo, while Mademoiselle de Villerie's hand was sought by Count Beauharnais. Many stars of lesser magnitude sparkled in this festive throng, but, amidst all, none shone with so much splen- dour as the Cuban beauty and Mademoiselle de Villerie. They reigned supreme, and seemed to rival each other in graceful display, as both seemed to possesss the very poetry of motion. Miss Montijo, as she glided through the mazes of the dance with her floating veil and drapery, seemed a very Venus, with the foam of the sea still resting on her; while Miss de Villerie, with her regal, queenly, brilliant diamonds and flashing eyes, seemed a very Juno. "Ye Gods," said Lord Ethelred, as Miss de Villenie passed him, "I must say it would be a difficult matter for a Paris to decide this evening to whom the apple should be awarded. I must candidly confess that, in all the assemblies in which I have been, either in Europe oriAmerica, I have never seen two more beautiful ladies. In fact, I have noticed that the Creoles of New Orleans   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.       61 in beauty can vie with any nation of the earth, not ex- cepting the fair Circassians, and in taste of dress excel even the Parisians." '"I thank you for the just compliment you pay my countrywomen," said Albert la Brancle, " and they would not be the less grateful could they know your flattering opinion; however, Senorita Montijo is a Cuban, but not the less entitled to your praise of her truly trans- cendent beauty. "She is indeed beautiful," replied Lord Ethelred, "but I rather prefer that lofty style of Miss de Villerie; her face is classically perfect and highly intellectual, while her eyes speak volumes. I would imagine her equal to any sacrifice when her pride was aroused." "Miss de Villerie is, most certainly, the undisputed belle, I shall not say of our city, but of our State; she is not unknown either in a literary point of view, and bids fair, in poesy, to be the Landon of America, while her prose equals that of De Stael." "She is, then," said Lord Ethelred, " a blue belle." "Yes," said Albert la Branche, laughing, "and I believe gentlemen of your nationality are partial to bluebells." "I am, indeed," said he, " and should be proud of such a lovely specimen of that class." "You will excuse me, Sir," said Albert la Branche, "while I speak to some friends, who, I see, have just arrived." As he spoke, he bowed to Lord Ethelred, and the latter, joining a party of ladies, was soon engaged in brilliant repartee, while Albert la Branche hastened for- ward to greet Miss Clifton, who had just, entered with  &#xD;<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7351-00000033"/> 62   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; her brother; and now all eyes were turned upon brother and sister. Beverly Clifton was about medium height, being slightly but well formed. His head was covered with wavy, golden hair, which fell over his fair and highly intellectual forehead in the most careless manner, while his large, full, blue eyes with their darkly-fringed lashes, Grecian nose, and well-formed mouth, completed as perfect and handsome a face as is ever beheld. We have already described the sister, but we will now endeavour to pourtray her as she stood at the present moment. Attired in white glace silk, with an over-skirt of puffed illusion intermingled throughout, with rich blonde and small bouquets of white moss-roses and gauze ribbon confining the puffs here and there. She wore no jewels, her only ornament being a natural white moss-rose bud fastened on the left side of her hair, and confining her golden ringlets in their place. If Miss de Villerie and Senorita Montijo were the Juno and Venus of the occasion, Miss Clifton was certainly the personi- fication of the lovely and retiring Psyche. Albert la Branche paid his devoirs to sister and brother, and was presently seen promenading the superb apartments with Miss Clifton leaning on his arm, while Beverly Clifton was observed bowing low at the shrine of the Senorita, to whom Judge de Breuil had intro- duced him. "This is, I presume, your first visit to our city," said Mr. Clifton, " as I have not had the pleasure of meeting you before." "Yes," she replied, with her rich accent, "but I grieve to say it. Had I known of its many attractions, I think I would, ere this, have been an old friend. As l   OR, TRUT1I AND JUSTICE.      635 it is, I do not feel as if this were but a first visit.

"They may truly deem themselves fortunate who bear in their face an impress of your dreams, for I imagine you regard them with more favour than 1: unfortunate individual whose only recommendation is his introduction." "By no means; yet it is pleasant to feel that we are surrounded by scenes and persons that are seemingly old acquaintances; and yet it may be my feelings arise from the fact that Louisiana, at an early day, was under Spanish government.  How  strange it is, the many changes the government of this state has undergone. First under the French government, then under) the Spanish, again the French, lastly the United States, and soon, I presume, to be under that of the Confede-   a racy. How does the latter, Mr. Clifton, accord with your sentiments?" "I feel it were useless to express my opinion, as it has now gone too far for aught that one of Union principles could do or say to arrest the great issue, which is war. My family are Unionists, and regret to see the bright stars of the old spangled banner disap- pearing from the cerulean sky on which they shone so brightly for so many yesfis. It may be only their Isidereal day. I trust if so the sun, which rose so gloomily, may have a refulgent setting. The South is mine by birthright, the Union mine by heritage from forefathers, who fought, bled, and died in her defence." t"  &#xD;<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7351-00000034"/> "   THE HEROINE OF THE PONFEDERA qY,; r As he ceased speaking, Madame de Breuil advanced towards them, leaning on the arr of the Hon. P. S--, and said, in her most engaging mianner, "Mr. Clifton, I trust you have not been entertaining our fair guest with treasonable sentiments. Methinks I heard the words 'Union' and 'star-spangled banner.' You are aware, I presume, that these are ostracised from all patriotic assemblies." "Most assuredly, Madame, and lest I should meet with the same fate, I shall henceforth be more guarded in my use of the condemned expressions; however, I know that you, Madame de Breuil, would refuse to deposit a shell against me." "I will promise you my support, I assure you, but on condition that you will never more offend. And now let us go and take a view of the card tables and their occupants, as I do not think you have yet even glanced at the rooms devoted to the graces." As they entered the room Miss Montijo's eyes became riveted on the face of one of the card players, a lady, seemingly but in the prime of womanly beauty, though, on -close inspec- tion, she was no less than forty-five years of age. She was above the medium height, of a rich brunette com- plexion, dark brown hair, and large, penetratinghazel eyes. Dressed in a robe of crimson velvet, with a scarf of black blonde, richly embroidered in gold, thrown over her magnificent neck and shoulders, which the part of none but a Creole would -dream of covering. She sat with one arm resting on the table, gazing steadily on the cards which the rest of the party had thrown down. "What magnificent lady is that?" said Senorita Montijo to her companion. "She is my very idea of   + OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.       65 an Oriental beauty."  As she spoke, Beverly Clifton turned in the direction,to which he saw her looking, and replied, "Is it possible that you have not seen before the superbly handsome Madame D   , of our city? She is the wit, and undisputed married belle. You perceive how completely absorbed she is in the game before her. She is accounted an unexcelled card-player, and report says she almost nightly at her palatial home either wins or loses a fortune." "I was under the impression, Mr. Clifton, that my country alone permitted the fair sex to indulge in such amusements. I had imagined it to be something un- known in America for a lady to bet on cards:." "With the American portion of the community it is not tolerated, and it is only so amongst those Creoles who adhere to the customs of their French ancestors, and have clung with tenacity to a fashion which the very idea of its being Parisian is enough to make it legal in the upper circles. But let us on to other scenes, Miss Montijo. The band has ceased, and I hear a magnificent voice in strains of song. Will you go with me in pursuit?" Leaving Madame de Breuil surrounded by a coterie of octogenarians, of whom she was the divinity, they advanced towards the chamber from whence the sing- ing proceeded. Miss Clarendon stood at one side of the piano, a very;beautiful and attractive girl, while Miss Clifton stood on the other, and the melody of their voices soon drew a crowd around them. ("What an enchanting voice Miss Clift in-possesses," said Lord Ethelred. "Her voice is perfect supplication ,j ' *     '    F  &#xD;<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7351-00000035"/> "   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; and tenderness. I never listened to a sweeter in my life. Though Miss Clarendon's is more the superb style, I do not like it as well. The latter would urge one to deeds of daring, while the former would soothe one to acts -of gentleness. The one the lark, soaring aloft, while the other is the plaintive dove. But see," he added, "here is the Philomel," as Miss de Villerie was seen advancing with a party of ladies and gentlemen towards the piano. "Come, Miss de Villerie, give us some music," said Madame Bienvenu, who anticipated the wishes of Lord Ethelred. "To afford pleasure to my friends, I consent," said Miss de Villerie, and, seating herself, she sang, with a soul-subduing tone, the beautiful solo "Viens," from Charles VI. As she ended she was called upon again and again, and politeness only caused her to relinquish the seat to others, for had she yielded to the solicitations of her friends she would have done so at the expense of her courtesy. Miss Montijo was now called upon to play, and seating herself at the harp, she struck the chords with all the wildness and mastery of a Welsh bard, and sang in thrilling tones, "The Moorish Lament." Her large and liquid eyes seemed to swim in revenge, and her voice rose and fell like the sighing of a storm spirit on ocean's rock-bound coast. Her style was lofty and grand, and her every note thrilled to the very soul. When she ceased the band struck .up a march, and the doors being thrown open, the guests entered the salle-a-manger, where was spread a banquet that the most fastidious disciple of Epicurus could not find /   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.       67 the least cause to complain of. Wine flowed, and wit sparkled from fluent tongues, and the hours rolled on in revelry. Miss Clifton and Albert la Branche had sepa- rated themselves from the festive throng, and sought the inviting beauties of the conservatory, which opened from the parlours, and which was now illuminated, dis- playing the various exotics and gaily-plumaged birds in their golden wire cages. There in the depths of arti- ficial groves, cataracts, and fountains, one might easily forget their identity, and imagine themselves in the midst of a South American forest, or standing amidst the deep and fertile valleys of Switzerland, as here and there a miniature chalet peeped forth from an artistic opening in the shrubbery. In one part might the sad notes of the arapengo and alma-perdido be heard, and in another, and not far distant, the tinkling of a sheep bell, reminding one of Alpine glaciers, and the grazing of flocks at their vernal base. Arriving at a fountain at the lower end of the conservatory, Miss Clifton and her com- panion seated themselves. The tableau was beautiful. By the side of this fountain, in whose waters their forms were pictured, they sat while Time's flying hand pointed to the "wee small hours," Shaded by the leaves of 'a graceful palm, and gazing abstractedly at the nereids and dolphins which sported in the basin of the fount, sat Albert la Branche and Cornie Clifton, seemingly in all the boyishness and girlishness of a Paul and Virginia. "Miss Clifton," said Albert la Branche, as he took within his own her yielding hand, "I trust the impetuo- sity of my nature will be sufficient apology for what I am about to say to you, and this, I find, is quite as appropriate a place as any other for the avowal of my F 2  &#xD;<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7351-00000036"/> 68    THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; feelings. I need scarce utter the words, for you must have known that, from the moment we met, I loved you with all the ardour, depth, and sincerity of one who, though possessing a susceptible heart, never knew the meaning of the word love until he met you. Yes, though I have knelt at many shrines, it was done with the same feeling as one who bows at the altar of the idol his ancestors worshipped, with the conviction that there was a true God, not formed from things of earth. I, like this idolator, have found my idols dust, but in you have found the true divinity, at whose shrine I shall only offer heart-incense, pure as ever rose in clouds from the altars of Baal, or the true God. Speak, Miss Clifton; tell me that I may hope to win your love, and that I am not wholly indifferent to you." As he ceased speaking, she raised her'eyes to his, and said, as the blushes suffused her neck and face, "Mr. la Branche, is it possible you can love, or desire the love of one whose feelings and sentiments are so diametrically opposed to your's?" "What matters it to me," he said, " what your senti- ments in regard to other things or objects, so that I possess your love? If we love each other there will be no difference of opinion. Parthenia gives to Ingomar the only true definition of this divine feeling- 'Two souls with but a single thought, Two hearts that beat as one."' "Then," she replied archly, " this implies a yielding up of one or the other's nature, which yields?

It was the latter that caused a God to immolate himself for ungrateful men. It was the former which caused Coriolanus to forego a victory. It was the latter which left us records and footprints of saints and martyrs. It was the former that gave strength to a queen to suck the poison from the wound of her husband, caused by an envenomed dart. It is by the latter we hope for our salvation. Yes, Miss Clifton, it is only those who can boldly face suffering, and are pre- pared to make sacrifices, who can love. I feel assured, too, that your sentiments on this subject coincide with mine." "Vraiment," she said, "you are a most excellent expounder of the code of Cupid; he has an able advo- cate." "Ah, Miss Clifton," he answered, "I perceive that you are disposed to trifle with me, or that my homage has been offered to one who cares not for it, or who possibly gives me to understand by evasions that she would spare me the pain of a rejection." "Do not, Mr. la Branche, I entreat you, judge me so lightly, nor think for a moment I would trifle with any one's feelings, particularly one who has honoured me with such sentiments as you have expressed. No, be assured that your kind regard for me is not unappreciated, and believe me when I say that I am gratefuil for the partiality which has sought me out from amongst so many fairer and worthier ladies, and which has placed me, too, in the enviable position of, being chosen by one whom it might be deemed a privilege to be permitted to love." She stopped soon as this sentence was uttered,  &#xD;<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7351-00000037"/> 70   THE HEROINE OF TIIE CONFEDERACY; and the blood which had died away, now returned in gushing tides, surging over neck and face, and Albert la Branche rapturously and respectfully placed her hand to his lips, and then pressing it to his heart, said,- "Bless you, Miss Clifton, for those words, though they do me more than justice. I knew I was not mis- taken in your true womanly heart, and though if you could not love me, even I should deem myself happy and honoured in being possessed of your friendship. I know that our acquaintance is brief, almost too much so in the estimation of the world, for the liberty which I have taken in giving utterance to words and feelings which are but the outpourings of a heart burning with all the intensity of a first, pure, and devoted love. I had dreamed I loved before, the reality convinces me, Miss Clifton, years of acquaintance could never make me more wholly yours than I am at this moment. If you doubt, then let years of devotion prove it. Exile me, if you will, Iwould deem centuries of toil as little, com- pared to any ray of hope that you would in the end be mine. May I look forward to that moment, say, dearest Miss Clifton, shall I be allowed to hope?" "Mr. la Branche, I am unskilled in the world's arts, and in its deceptions. I have never, like many others, been able to don the habit of hypocrisy to suit a pur- pose, and then lay it aside at will, like an unpleasant garment. I know, however, that if a woman wishes to be loved, she must conceal her sentiments from the object of it. This may be a true philosophy, but it is only suited to the  Stoics.

"Generous and devoted girl," said Albert la Branche, throwing his arms around her, and drawing her close to his heart, "you shall never have cause to regret the confidence you have reposed in me. Yes, love and trust me, darling, and you will find' me not unworthy; and may the love which you here confessed this evening, joined to my own, grow deeper, stronger as time passes away, and may it, when your golden locks and my raven hair are changed to argentine threads, may it be still as now, each loving and beloved. Dearest in your love, I possess strength to arm me for the combat, and a shield, which shall be my safeguard from all evil. And now, beloved, let me have once more your sweet assurance (ere we are intruded on), that I am loved, and that you promise to be mine?" "Yes, dearest Albert, I love thee, and thee only, now and eternally." "May this then seal the compact which angels now record," he said, bending over, and kissing her fair cheek, "and may your assurances be as often, ay, more often  &#xD;<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7351-00000038"/> 72   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; renewed than that rainbow covenant, which reminds us of God's mercy to men." They arose from their rustic seat just as the merry voice of Madame Bienvenu broke upon their ears, saying in the most bewitching, tones, *"Here are the truants! Come, you must give an account of yourselves, and tell us how you dared to absent yourselves from the presence of our noble company, thus displaying your preference' for the solitude of the forest to the splendours and gaieties of a palace." "Your Majesty being surrounded by so many cour- tiers, should not envy your less fair dame d'honneur, the attendance of one of her truest, faithful, and most liege subjects," answered Miss Clifton, in the same ironical tone; " but see," she continued, " your court approaches; gay ladies and their attendant cavaliers, and Misses de Villerie and Montijo being alone likely to dethrone you by their seeming conspiracies amongst the nobles of your realm." "Ma here," so long as the vrai nobility are loyal (alluding to Lord Ethelred), I shall not even fear a dethronement a misfortune, as you are aware that royalty seldom  succeeds in pleasing the rabble. Mais allons, Lord Ethelred, I have many beauties in Rosale to point out to you." Bowing they passed on, and soon our young friends were surrounded by the crowd, who now filled the conservatory, and when each and every one seemed delighted to rove. The band discoursed sweet strains, which fell upon the ear harmoniously in this lovely spot, and served to drown in melody the tones of lovers, as they breathed forth their love tales.

There still lingered one " when lights had fled and garlands were dead," and he alone had not "departed." Reader, can you divine who it is? Not to keep you longer in suspense, it was Albert la Branche, the accepted. When the crowd had dispersed, the lovers had returned to the conservatory, and now he stood with his arm around her slender form, seemingly loth to part from his chosen and beautiful fiancee. But foot- steps are approaching, and he must leave. Dipping his fingers into the waters of the fountain, he said (as he sprinkled the water drops upon her head), "I baptise thee, my own dear Cornie, in a new faith, that of trust in the one you have chosen as your guide through life, and in that of the noble cause I have espoused, and may it be pure as these crystal drops which I sprinkle upon your golden curls ; and may it wash away for ever every Union sentiment now existing in the bosom of my lovely, beloved, and affianced bride, and may this parting kiss be the seal on these lips to close for evermore the elo- quent pleadings, which in a just cause might win a world." Thus, with a kiss, they parted, and leaving her, he hastened to pay his respects to the family, and then left a happy and a proud man. Miss Clifton stood still beside the fountain where he had left her, and truly she looked the " spirit of the fount, as with her eyes dreamily gazing into the waters, she seemed not of earth, but of a holier sphere." The lights were fast paling as she arose to seek her chamber, there to " think on the past, and dream o'er the future." We will follow her, and listen to her soliloquy.

A MONTH has passed by since the events recorded in the last chapter, and Time in his onward march has wrought many changes.   Nought was now  heard in the streets of the city save the measured tread of the regular soldier, or the less perfect of the raw recruit or volun- teer.  Business houses were closed, and but few gather- ings were observed on the pavement of our once busy thoroughfare, Carondelet. Revolution, together with no cotton going to market, has wrought this change, and the haughty merchant, princes of Carondelet, bowed low in reverence to its once humble rival, Camp, which now with its banks, brokers' offices, insurance houses,   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.

Pale and anxious these individuals passed one by, so occupied with their schemes of outwitting the Govern- ment, and making transfer of property that they brushed past unheeding all save self. These despicable beings, who sucked the blood, and ground the bone and sinew of our wealthy planters, as the last act could only turn traitor to a country that had bestowed affluence and position on the sons and daughters, children and great grand children of Yankee school-masters and school- mistresses, as well as milliners, shopkeepers, and pork- dealers. Ingrates, that they were, their hour was fast approaching.  Camp Street, as before remarked, was now the street, and this morning thousands thronged its broad pavements to witness the entree of General D. E. Twiggs who was just returned from Texas, after having delivered into the hands of the Confederates the United States garrison. Every door, window, and balcony was lined with welcoming spectators. Soon the swell of music rose upon the air and fell'upon the ear of the expectant multitude, telling that the "chieftain advanced." Now the chariots came in view which bore the honourable escort, which consisted of the first gentlemen of the different seceded States then in the city.   Next came the veteran himself in a  &#xD;<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7351-00000041"/> 78   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; splendid landau drawn by four beautiful white steeds. Bowing and smiling to the ladies who were enthusi- astically waving their handkerchiefs and strewing his way with flowers, he passed slowly on, and every now and then the vast assembly of people rent the air with accla- mations as he " bent his eminent top to their low ranks." On he passed, and the vast crowd of people rolled on in waves also, until, arriving at his mansion, he entered and was lost to view. Night came and still they sought to do him honour, and when the serenade roused him up at the close of his day of weary travel, but of pleasant reminiscences, his heart bounded with grati- tude to think he was still remembered, and advancing into the corridor bade his domestics throw wide the portals and admit those who sought to do him hom- age, and to prepare a banquet worthy of his name. (The author need not dwell upon this subject, for others who were also witnesses of the honours con- ferred on him, and the high appointment which was soon after bestowed will recognise the sentiments of the people, and the patriotic devotion which prompted them). It was far into midnight when'the crowd once more reluctantly withdrew, and the shouts of "Hurrah for Jeff. Davis, Gen. Twiggs, and the Southern Con- federacy," broke upon the still air and died away in the glooming. But a patriot's act had called forth these huzzahs, 'and in the soul, heart, and voice of every man, woman, and fair maiden, did it echo and re-echo again and again. Yes, the hour had dawned for Southern liberty, and to her standard flocked the great and lowly, and one amongst the first to place his sword at the feet of the Southern Bellona was the hero just   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.       '4 named; he had served too to an honourable old age in the service of the United States, but when his native soil was threatened he, like a true son of a noble mother, espoused her cause and rallied to his standard his faithful adherents. Sublime is the picture, "When all deserts thee I shall still be with thee," and such were his sentiments now in the hour of his country's need. He was not however alone, and every day found the desks in the senatorial clambers at Washington deserted one by one, until none but the republican or Abolition party remained, and our hopes grew bright and strong. The North at this hour was losing the radiance that had made her appear as the light of a new universe, and in her political, moral, and martial firmament her stars were beginning to pale, while in the Southern canopy of Heaven beamed forth new and brighter constellations. The storm of, hatred had not as yet swept over the earth (true some blood had flown), but it was brewing, and the elements looked dark and for- bidding. Did it find us unprepared to meet the issue? The end will prove. Dark clouds and rolling thunders, presage, ruin, but after they are passed come brighter days with smiling sunny skies. Dear reader, I am not an historian, nor do I wish to venture on historic soil. My work is only intended to pourtray a few (to some perhaps interesting) events that will be probably lost sight of by more worthy " gray goose quills " than mine, but which are not the less true or valuable.

So now, kind reader, I will transport you to other and more agreeable scenes. We will now return to our fair heroine with whom we parted so unceremoniously on the night of thefete, on this bright spring morning, and find her seated in a grotto, whose rocky sides are thickly covered and over- hung with jessamine and honeysuckle. She holds in her hand a book entitled "Woman's Faith," and so intent is she gazing on its pages that she hears not the footfall which approaches. The intruder speaks, when slightly starting, she arises to her feet as Count Beau- harnais says- "Miss de Villerie will, I trust, pardon this intrusion on her privacy of so warm a friend as Eugene Beau- harnais will prove himself." "You are pardoned, Count," she answered, with a slight blush; " but may I ask who gave you the clue to this Rosamond bower? it is not many, I assure you, who ever enter here-this is my sanctum sanctorum. Tell me, I pray you, who directed your footsteps to this spot?" "Most willingly," he responded. "Being told you had gone forth to promenade in the grounds, and not caring to sit in the parlour to await your coming, I thought I would stroll through the groves of this arcadia likewise. So, sauntering through interminable labyrinths of flowers, vines, and trees, I came at last upon this grotto which, in its appearance, reminded me of Calypso's, and I thought I would enter-and, behold! -and lo! a divinity! And now, Miss de Villerie, I have but one word more to say, and that is, that I promise   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      81 to act towards you with more gratitude than Ulysses or Telemachus, provided you are as generous towards me in your invitation to prolong my stay." She smilingly remarked, "I do not think, Count, that you stand in need of the consolations of either of those classic heroes, as you have not as yet apprised me of your misfortunes, nor on what coast you suffered shipwreck-as the latter will only entitle you to my protection." "Then, fair mortel ou deesse, I claim it, for I have long since been wrecked on the coral reefs, and I now throw myself upon your mercy, as you alone have the power to render me insensible to my sufferings." "Then, allons to the mansion, where I shall take pleasure in receiving you, and where myjejune nymphles await your pleasure." "No, Miss de Villerie, let it be here, where nature vying with art may render me eloquent to express my sentiments to you. We will now lay aside trifling, and speak sincerely. Sit down, Miss de Villerie, I have much to say. I will not speak to you of love in the hackneyed strains that is always used, but I will tell you simply that I love you-have loved you from the moment we first met-and that now I desire a candid response from you." As she essayed to speak, he said--"Hear me through, Miss de Villerie, and then answer sincerely, and, as I know you to be a  true woman, considerately. I came this morning to lay at your feet my heart and hand, as also to ask if the love which burns within my own breast has met with a reciprocal feeling in yours; and to say that, should you not entertain feelings of love  &#xD;<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7351-00000043"/> 82   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; for me, such as would prompt you to accept my proposal at this moment, I would say, Miss de Villerie, that if you can but esteem me, and still will permit me to love you, I shall hope to win you at last. If, on the other hand, you love me, as I have been vain enough to hope, will you consent to wed now, and leave with me a country that is soon (I may say already) to be the theatre of a civil war, which will end in the ruin of every one? Yes, Miss de Villerie, I prophesy for your country a lengthy contest, then consent to be mine, and fly with me to la belle France, where mid its scenes of splendor you are fitted by birth and nature to adorn, you will forget the woes of your native land, and with my devoted love to guard and cherish you, you will cease to regret the honoured, loved, but distant guardians of your child-, hood's days. And now, Miss de Villerie, I await your answer." She had in vain essayed to speak, and now as he ceased she arose from her sitting posture and stood erect, leaning her arm upon a jutting rock, and regard- ing him with a sad, regretful look, she said--"Count Beauharnais, you will confess that it is your own fault that you have gone thus far in making an avowal of  ! feelings that I can never--no, never, reciprocate. If I had ever given you to understand, by word or action, that such feelings were known or would be reciprocated, then, I assure you, it was done without any such inten- tions on my part. But were it otherwise, and that I loved you, Count, you know little of my nature when  ! you would make such a proposal as your last. Think you, would I leave my country when the invaders' foot- steps are polluting its soil, and when their assassin   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.       83 hands are raised to strike at the heart of each and every countryman of mine, to revel in the halls of fashion and nobility?  Count Beauharnais, you little know me Could I, suppose you, leave the graves of my father and mother behind me, and know that they were being trodden upon by our ruthless enemies, and I, too, far away? Could I leave either the honoured, dearly; beloved guardians of my   childhood, girlhood--ay, womanhood, to brave the storm alone, who had sheltered me from the tempests which usually beset an orphans life. No, never, Count Beauharnais!  My God, my country, and her people first-these are termed celestial affections. Love of man last, which is terrestrial. One who is untrue to the three former, would never be true to the latter. So, now, my dear friend, you will perceive that if the first of yourproposalwere possible, the latter were impossible. And now I trust that I have answered you as fully, as concisely, and considerately as you could desire, trusting that my  candour has not forfeited your esteem." "My esteem, Miss de Villerie? No; nor what is more, my love, which you still possess, and which is but increased by the utterance of these noble sentiments. I shall not be long in your city, Miss de Villerie, and I trust that I still shall be permitted the pleasure of your society, as, notwithstanding all you have said, I hope to win you yet. Yes, I   will hope on--hope ever, for you will never meet with love so true as mine; and when ocean's waste is between us, remember that I shall need but one word of recall and I  shall be with you. Your friendship, Miss de Villerie, I accept for the present; all aspirants to honours must serve an apprenticeship." 2  &#xD;<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC7351-00000044"/> 84    THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; Saying this, he took her hand, knelt before her, and pressing it to his heart, impressed a burning kiss upon it, and then rising, said-"Come, let us home-; I have no desire to remain longer here." As he led her forth, he plucked an ivy leaf, and said-"Permit me, Miss de Villerie, to fasten this in your hair." She bent her head gracefully, and as he secured it with her golden pins in her raven tresses, he continued--"I am like the ivy you will find-should adversity overtake you, I will cling the closer to you." He walked beside her for some time in silence; at last, glancing at the book she now held closed in her hands, he said-"May I ask of what subject your book treats that you were so engrossed with when I entered this morning?" "I was reading and pondering on the inconsistency of this author, who evidently advocates abolitionism, and Protestantism, yet in her writings has been culpable of many errors, inconsistencies, and, without malice, I can say, untruths, some of which I will read you. First, the writer is evidently a rank Protestant, and can find nothing in the Cat/holic religion to censure, but launches forth into a very pathetic strain of moralizing, which she puts into the mouth of her hero, referring to N. 0., says, 'Here no temple-spires frown upon the gay votary of pleasure, but beneath the very shadow of the old cathedral, and under the unreproving eye of those who minister at her altars, I may pursue pleasure in her wildest revels, to her hidden and most secret retreats.' In this the author has displayed such malevolence of spirit, as well as gross and astounding ignorance, that, though controvertible in every point, the very idea of combatting the arguments of such a benighted indi?   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.       85 vidual, worries me; for though we would be willing to instruct a child, we would hesitate to begin the task with one who had grown up to manhood, or woman- hood, with such a foundation for their guide, and with false views on every subject, gathered from those with as small a share of enlightenment as themselves. So it is in this case. To plant the seed of a good fruit is pleasant enough, but to uproot the bad, is not so agree- able a task. But, notwithstanding, our ministers do not reprove us for sinning; her hero comes to the conclu- sion that in our church (the Catholic) alone are found the 'self-sacrificing angels of earth.' Hear what she says. 'I know, rejoined Blanche, that few of our sex have won for themselves the golden opinions of the world, by acts of disinterested and self-denying benevo- lence, but there are some who, though their names are not blazoned upon this world's scroll of fame, will find that they are written in the book of life for the unseen and blessed charities which from their hands have fallen like the dew upon the poor and deserted children of humanity.   How  often by the bed-side of wretched want, and pining poverty, are seen those Sisters of Chlarity-providing for the necessitous, even to the most menial offices, or soothing the last hours of the sick and the dying, when   others of our sex, blessed with the most ample means by the Father of us all, look with stolid indifference, and unconcern, upon the saddest picture presented  by the wretchedness of our fallen race!' The world looks upon these, I know, as a part of a great orginery prepared by the Roman Catholic church, but such acts could spring from no sectarian feeling, and no more belong to that church than does  &#xD;<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC7351-00000045"/> 86    THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; the magnificent old Gothic architecture, the living, breathing pictures of the Madonna, and the crucifixion, or the ora pro nobis, whose mellow, rich, solemn tones are so deeply entrancing.' 'My dear Mademoiselle Blanche,' continued Miss de Villerie, 'this is just so much wholesale robbery on your part. Will you tell me who it is that recognises the crucifix as the emblem of salvation, or who it is who has preserved from the wreck of time the 'life-breathing portraits of the Madonna,' as also who the composer of this chant, whose solemn tones seem so deeply to entrance you? These were all in existence ere your Luthers, Amsdorfs, or Melancthons were dreamed of, and generations ere their presumptuous separation from the mother church. Ye have wandered forth like the prodigal, and would now willingly gather to yourselves the crumbs which have fallen from our groaning board. Return, kind friends, like that prodigal, and we will share our treasures with you, even to the ' fatted calf.' But permit me to read you again another of her very consistent speeches. After anathematising slavery and slave- owners, she says, in reference to some slaves who were emancipated, and sent north, in response to the following question. 'How are the negroes,' said Burns, ' treated by their white neighbours?'  'I am sorry to say,' replied Eaton (who, by the way, is a Methodist minister, and, as something quite rare in this instance, one of that sect tells the truth), 'with no little degree of dis- favour. Even those are loudest in their denunciations of slavery, are the least tolerant of the dark skins of these children of Africa.' And further on, a Northerner by birth expresses these sentiments. 'I regret to   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      87 admit,' said Burns, ' that there is strange contradictions in the conduct of those who reside in the free States, upon the subject of the rights of the coloured race. They exclaim, with holy horror, against the sins of slavery, and yet their prejudice against colour is vastly greater than it is at the South. And in some of the free States they have carried it to the extent of passing laws forbidding free persons of colour to reside within the limits. This is the philanthropy they boast so much of, and this is the consistency you will ever find amongst them. I can truly exclaim, 'Consistency, thou art a jewel! '" "From the style, Miss de Villerie, in which it is written, I should judge the author to be a female, and you know a good writer amongst your sex is seldom met with, and still more rare the jewel, consistency." He said this with an arch look, and was about to speak again, but she stopped him with the imperative com- mand of, "Not one word more, Count. Not one word more will I listen to, after this flattering compliment paid our sex. Not writers indeed!  Is it not well known that the Greek poetess Corrinna took the prize five times over Pindar; and that in a later day a woman's pen caused one of the greatest Generals the world ever knew, afterwards an Emperor, viz., Napo- leon, to tremble and grow pale. So much did he fear the world-renowned De Stael that he even ordered her to quit his dominions. I could quote many, but you are too well aware of those facts to make it necessary." They had now reached the door of the drawing- room, and Judge de Breuil, advancing to meet them, said, as he handed Miss de Villerie a letter, "My dear  &#xD;<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7351-00000046"/> 88    THE HEROIIE OF THE CONFEDERACY; Miss de Villerie, I was about to go in pursuit of you, as I imagined you would be pleased to peruse the letter. The Count and myself will excuse you while you retire to learn the contents." Saying this, Judge de Breuil drew the Count's arm within his own, and they entered the library, where we will leave them to smoke their Havanna cigars if they like, while we follow Miss de Villerie. What has caused the blood to rush in crimson tides to our heroines neck and brow? Glancing at the superscription, she had clasped the letter to her wildly- beating heart, and with hurried steps had sought her chamber, and there, turning the key in the lock to pre- vent intrusion, she kissed the seal, and there opened the missive. Reader, as her eye glances over the page, what causes her cheek to pale, and the tear-drops to dim those lustrous eyes? Can you not divine it? The next chapter will unfold all. f'   OR, TRUTII AND JUSTICE.      89 i CHAPTER Vill. "A change came o'er the spirit of my dream." MSS DE VTrJLRIE sat for hours gazing upon the letter she held in her hand, while the large tears coursed slowly down her cheeks. "Can I be dreaming?" she murmured. "Oh! is it not some dreadful illusion, or, is it indeed true that he whom I have loved so fondly can be other than he once seemed to me? And yet I thought him noble, and would have yielded up my life for hs happiness; but now, when he sees my country on the eve of a revolu- tion, which may end in the ruin of her people, he ingloriously consents to wield his sword in defence of a Union which long since ceased to be just. Oh, Clarence, Clarence, recall what you have said. No, no, I can never, never wed the enemy of my country and her people." But, kind reader, I will not hold you longer in suspense, and will lay before you the letter which called forth those remarks: "I My beloved Natalie, "Long ere this reaches you, possibly the blockade of your Southern ports by our Government (or rather  &#xD;<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7351-00000047"/> 90    THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; mine) may render a response to this by mail impossible.

And now, my own dear Natalie, I will lay before you the exact position of affairs in regard to us both, and I know that as usual, with your good sense, sound judgment, and loving heart, you will triumph over and defeat every obstacle and objection that may come between yourself and the fulfilment of my own, and I trust your wishes, and con- sent to be mine without further delay. The dissolution so long looked forward to, by some with sorrow, by others with joy, has at last arrived, and our country (though we of the North still mention it as one, we must inwardly confess that il feeling it can never be so again) is divided, and civil war now frowns upon us in its most fearful panoply. Natalie, my own dear, be mine, ere rivers of blood shall flow between and separate us, mayhap for ever.  I have espoused the cause of my native land, and am now clothed cap-a-pie in the armour of faith, right, and justice, to go forth to quell this unholy rebellion. Beloved, there are none to whom you owe obedience. Though early ties will cling around your memory, and mayhaps cost you many struggles, fling them aside, darling, and trust in one whom you so fondly promised to love. Trust in me, and give me that right which you long since promised, to protect you, and I shall feel strengthened for the contest which approaches. Give me but the right to claim you, Natalie, and I will soon be with you.

One word, dearest, will bring me to you; less may separate us for all eternity. Be it in this world, or in the next, you can never be other than mine. Fly with me, my Natalie, from a land that will soon be deluged in blood, and its now verdant and cultivated fields and gardens be laid waste and desolate. Yes, fly with me to a clime where there are those who await to shower all the blessings of peace, love, affection, and heart-worship upon you. I await your decision, my truly, dearly beloved fiancee.

But I must yield one or the other, and though it sever my very heart- strings, I will resign him for aye.  Yes, now while love, pride, and honour struggle for the mastery, I will write my last (O God! that it should be so) to one whom it is the sacrifice of all my earthly happiness to resign, but whom it were now dishonour to love." Sounding a bell, she said to Victorine, who answered the summons, ",My escretoire, and let none enter my apartments, and say to all calls for me to day, 'Not at home.'"

"Say to him that I am indisposed, but V;ill be pleased to see him on his next visit to Rosale, which I hope will be soon." The maid disappeared, and in a few moments re- turned, bearing the escretoire, as also a large crimson poppy, which she presented to her mistress, saying, "Count Beauharnais desired me to present to you this flower, which he said he himself had culled on the parterre, and the card attached." Taking up the card, she glanced at it, and seeing the word "Consolation," remarked, "Nothing could indeed be more appropriate. I do indeed need consolation, but there is none save One who can afford it me. Noble-hearted as you are, Count Beauharnais, I could never love you, though perhaps on the altar of a less true idol my heart's best gifts have been offered up, and now the idol has proved but com- mon clay, and those God-like attributes where are they? Ay, echo answers, 'Where are they?"' Seizing her pen, she wrote the following reply:-- "Rosale Plantation, Louisiana.

I need not say to you how I had trusted in your bravery and chivalry, and, lastly, I need not say (for you must know it) that by your last act you proved to me that my idol was only formed from common dust or gilded loam, and the last stroke of your pen transferred my beau ideal into all and everything but that which is noble, elevated, and sincere, and how, when Clarence Belden donned his sword and buckler and armed himself cap-a-pie for the contest, that the first thrust of the glistening steel entered Natalie de Villerie's heart. Oh, no! this were all unnecessary. It may be some consolation to' you to feel that when the ' deluge of blood,' of which you speak with such unconcern, shall have inundated our country, and our ' verdant fields are laid waste' that its sanguine floods will sweep .over the graves of every man, woman, or child of our own sunny land, and that when the avarice of our Northern foes shall drain these fields which you say are to be laid waste, and with the natural con- sequence of a sanguinary deluge to be submerged in blood; when they shall drain them I repeat, to plant, and in time to reap their ill-gotten harvests, they will find, perhaps, the dragon's teeth which they sowed with such diligence as the fruits of their labour.

Rest assured we are prepared for all emergencies, and even our women, in devotion to their country's cause, will stand unparralleled in history. Each and every South- ern woman's cry is ' Give us but a crust of bread and a cup of water from the running brook, but give, oh, give, us liberty.' The truth of what the poet has said in the following lines is but well exemplified in the unanimity of the sentiment which pervades all ranks and condition of my sex:- 'The love that bids the patriot rise to guard his country's rest, With deeper mightier fulness thrills in woman's gentle breast.' "Yes, like the Spartan mothers of old, our women say to their husbands, sons, fathers, and lovers, 'Come with your shield, or on it.' What would under other circumstances have been death for me to do, under the present I do without one pang of regret, not even one lingering thought of the past. After this letter shall have received its address from my pen and be des- patched to you, the waters of oblivion will roll over every souvenir of the past, and efface even your name from a heart where once I had thought it as deeply written as Queen Mary said of Calais, it would be engraven on my heart.

The struggle was now over when Miss de Villerie laid down her pen; she was calm, but it was the calm- ness of a martyr who. lays down his life for "his faith, but whose flesh only writhes on the rack of torture, the soul being elevated far above the ephemeral joys of this world. Her nature was one that loved deeply and with all the intensity of those who can love but once. To Clarence Belden the first pure gushing love of her youth and womanhood was given, and now that he had failed to be all that she had deemed him she had no further faith in men. Alas, how sad it is to think how mere gilding can seem so like genuine gold! Rising from her seat Miss de Villerie paced the apartment slowly and thoughtfully, murmuring sadly, "Yes, I have: given thee up Clarence Belden, but like Maring Falerio who con- demned his son to banishment, the sentence I have pronounced will kill me. Oh! -how false the words 'without one pang of regret,' and yet they are true, for it is not one pang, but ten thousand, and my poor heart is breaking 'neath its weight of pride and honour.

Throwing herself upon a couch, she fell asleep, with her dark hair falling around her she slept a fevered sleep. Madame de Breuil entering, and seeing her thus, gently drew the letter from her hand, which she held close pressed to her heart. She then  i summoned Victorine, and ordered her to bring ice-water and lavender. She gently bathed the brow, temples, and neck of the Unhappy girl, and bending over her with all a mother's tenderness kissed her fevered cheeks, while a hot tear stole down her own and dropped upon the burning cheek of Miss de Villerie, who starting from her uneasy slumber, and seeing Madame de Breuil raised her head from the pillow and said wildly, "Yes, yes, he is gone for ever, and past recall, and like Mary Queen of Scots I have signed an abdication to all happi- ness. Oh God! why have I loved so fondly?"Burying her face in the lap of Madame de Breuil, who understood  all, she wept convulsively, and tried to speak.

It was only a delicious dream of that long ago, dreams of that sad but still happy time-when the few shadows that fell around my    path in life was like the green spots in the desert where the traveller halts to rest awhile, and feels the cool refresh- ing influence of repose. Oh, I saw him as when I had first met him, in the moment when he first taught my young heart the delight, the ecstacy of loving and being loved; and when he had breathed into my spirit bright and sunny hopes as well as celestial aspirations--making the world, this life itself, a Heaven of bliss and unalloyed felicity! Oh, as I dreamed, there stole over my senses that perfect sense of repose which children of earth rarely feel, and to which I doubt the famed cup of Haskesch could add one drop to. This sensation thrilled my whole being, and I felt borne upon the wings of angels far past earth and clouds, ay, further, and yet further still into the realm of eternal light. Then sucih strains of music burst upon my ear, that it seemed as though the melody was produced by the rushing of angels' pinions, as they swept past each other in their worship before the -throne of the Eternal. But slowly died away the mellifluous cadences-and slowly, one by one, Heaven, its angels- bright wings and golden throne-fled from my view, and earth again appeared to me as I slowly passed through aether descending. When, lo! as ,I approached nearer, there stood an angel on a beautiful green knoll, who beck: oned me towards him. Unconsciously I was borne to the spot; and seating myself at the feet of the angel (methought his wings o'er-shadowed the whole hill and valley in front of me), I glanced beneath 'at the base, H  &#xD;<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC7351-00000051"/> 98    THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; beyond the valley, there rolled a river of blood, and beyond it nought save desolation; while on the side on which I sat with the angel, smiled verdant plains, clear and sparkling streams, with charming cottages beside sylvan lakes, and at my feet grazed flocks and herds, and all seemed busy, active life. On this sanguine river floated a gilded steamer, out of whose pipes flew birds instead of smoke. To the opposite side there flew the vulture, raven, crow, and petrel, and the side on which I sat with the angel, flew over the dove and gay plumaged songsters, until all the vale rang with their song. After I had beheld the sight, the angel plumed his wings for flight, and saying, "Thou hast chosen well," vanished into the thin grey air; and thus, me- thought, there fell upon my face a holy dew, which dropped frgm his wings as he ascended; but alas! dear, dear friend, I awoke to find it but a dream, but yet you have endeavoured to make up for the dew of Heaven by the refreshing dew of friendship, which your kind hands were administering when I awoke. Would thou were a Joseph to interpret my dream or vision. Oh! why is it, that it should be thus; that he, whom of all others I idolized, should now prove unworthy, but still dear, ever dear to me. Why, oh! why, did I rely so implicitly in him? 1, whom the world has termed cold, and even austere, am stricken like a fragile blossom by the first gale on life's shores. Oh, my country, my people, though I love you much, this sacrifice, for me, is greater than Jephtha.

Slowly she sank upon her couch, and with her white hands crossed upon her breast, she once more sank to repose. She had asked for his letter, and it now rested on her heart.   One large tear trembled on her eyelid, coursing its way down her fevered cheek, fell upon her bosom, and rested like a diamond on polished marble. She slept calmly, peacefully, and when morning dawned it found her serene as a spring day. No one could have told how hard the struggle had been who saw her as she greeted Judge de Breuil, as he entered the breakfast apartment on the morning after her reception of Clarence Belden's letter. No, not the keenest observer could trace, in the smiling face, and proud  manner, a single mark of grief or self-sacrifice. Little do the smiling valleys, green and fertile sides of the volcano, with here and there a hamlet at its base, bespeak the convulsion which oftens rocks the earth to its centre, and devastates the land. So with Miss de Villerie, the convulsion had passed, and the lava which flowed from the fire of love out of the crater of passion, had now cooled, and   she appeared like the exterior of the volcano, smiling and unconscious of the still slumber. ing sparks within. Breakfast was eaten in silence, and though not a word was spoken on the subject to Judge de Breuil, he had guessed all. As they arose from table, he said to Miss de Villerie, " at your leisure I would see you in the library." "Then let it be now, .dear guardian, as my leisure is ever at your pleasure." On entering the library, Judge de Breuil seated Miss H 2  &#xD;<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC7351-00000052"/> 100   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; de Villerie in a chair, and drawing one beside it, seated himself, and thus began:- "My dear ward, I would speak to you this morning, not as your guardian, but as your father, which part I have acted, to the best of my ability, since the demise of my highly esteemed and much valued friend, your father. I shall ask of you no recital of what I have already my suspicions, though none but the anxiety of one who loves you with parental devotion could have discovered it. I would not lacerate your heart by requesting any particu- lars of a subject which, as a woman, you would feel a delicacy in discussing, even with me; but thus much I would say, my beloved ward, that, if Clarence Belden has possessed your heart until this moment, permit him to retain it, and do not blast your hopes of earthly happi- ness by resigning him. No, let no such love of patriotism destroy your felicity.-; You are now of age, and your own mistress, still though we (my sister and self) would regret to see the moment in which you parted from us arrive, yet if you can be happier with him who has won your heart's worship than with us, we both would resign you to love and joy, though it must be confessed we would feel a pang in yielding you to one whom I learn is now our declared enemy, and thus placing a barrier between the intercourse of love and friendship, which, if . your lot had been cast amongst us would exist. Never- theless, by following the dictates of heart and conscience, you will never forfeit the love of those whom long years of acquaintance have endeared you to; rest assured dear Natalie, that because you should give us up for a newer, but less tried love, we should not love you the less, or   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      101 would the name of Mrs. C. Belden should ever be less esteemed, nay worshipped, in our hearts and homes than that of Natalie de Villerie. Your property which the laws of the Confederacy, under such circumstances, would not yield to you, I have taken the precaution to save, and secure to you, and to the amount your father left you, I will add fifty thousand dollars, as your marriage portion; thus you perceive, I have shielded you from all the obstacles which generally make the road to true love so unsmooth; and now, my dearly-loved Natalie, choose as you will, and rest assured if it be the ' better part' it shall not be taken from thee." Miss de Villerie had sat with her face averted during this conversation, and now she knelt before him, from which position he in vain endeavoured to raise her, as, sinking low at his feet, she rested her head upon his knees, and clasped his hands close within her own, in vain she essayed to speak, when a torrent of tears coming to her relief, she said, "Oh, my guardian, my own dear father, how could you speak' thus? Leave you, oh no, never. Leave you to go to the love and home of one who is now and for evermore your enemy, and that of all that is true to me.  Oh, my own kind, my own dearly-beloved guardian, how could you deem me such an ingrate. Yes, Clarence Belden, I have loved deeply, fondly, ay, almost madly, but it is passed nonw. The power he held was a tyrant's, and now I am free. Yes, free, but like a bird in the serpent's power, my heart yet clings to reminiscences of the soon to be for ever buried past, and sighs for the love-illumined paths through which I once roamed when under his fond eye.

No; to happiness I have breathed a long, a sad adieu, and on the shrine of God and my country I have laid my bleeding, but trembling, lace- rated heart. Yes, dear, dear guardian, I have cast the die, and crossed the Rubicon, and am now passing on to victory, sadly, but gloriously. No more shall love's spells weave their thralls around me; never again shall my bosom inhale the consuming air of passion, save love for tried and faithful friends, such as you, my dear father, by your care have proved to me.  Yes, dear guardian, I shall choose the better part, and where my girlhood days have passed in blissful repose, here will Natalie remain, and when once more tranquillity of mind asserts its sway, you shall see no tears bedewing these now dimmed eyes, but you shall see me the heppy, gay, almost thoughtless, being I was when first your kind hands, and those of your sister, commenced the training of this crooked vine. Yes, your home shall not be sad. dened by any sorrows of mine. Yes, oh yes, these bitter, bitter tears in which my eyes now swim, shall cease to flow, and I shall never look beyond the threshold of home again for love and happiness, save far above to that One whose love shall never change, and in whose guidance I shall ever trust through  life. Yes, my guardian, with thee have I lived, with thee will I die. The storms that may ruffle the waves of thy existence  i shall break over mine also, and the billows which may engulf thee shall also roll over me. The friends who are thine shall be mine also; the stars which beam o'er thy pathway shall shine on mine; the breeze which fans thy cheek shall sweep o'er mine; the flowers which waft their fragrance to you on the summer air will bear "   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      103 my prayers for you as incense to the throne of God; and, lastly, that God who shall be thine shall be mine, and the grave that closes over you shall also clasp me in its cold embrace. And now tell me, oh tell me, have I chosen well, my father, or do you doubt that I love you, and all the bright joys of a life which was spent with thee, and which shall continue? -Clarence Belden was all to me once, but now the spell is broken, and here alone in my childhood's home will I seek love such as will survive the ephemeral joys of earth. Keep the dowry which you so generously offer to bestow, or lay it as an offering on our country's altar, and take all else, but leave me, oh leave me, your love, which is far more preferable than gold can ever be." Arising, she caught his hand, pressed it to her heart, and imprinting a kiss upon it, turned to leave, when gently arresting the movement, he drew her to his bosom, saying, "My daughter, you have indeed chosen well and nobly, and may you find in the affection of those around you com- pensation for the love you have so heroically resigned. You have won the victory over self, and proved yourself by far a greater general than those who have won their laurels upon a gory field. Your father, who, perhaps, at this moment is witnessing your noble self-sacrifice, smiles a benison on thee from his far off heavenly home. Time, the great assuager of grief, will dry those tears, and you will again love as truly and ardently as you have loved your misguided Clarence.'  "Never, oh never, my guardian. I have-I have loved Clarence, and though on earth the irrevocable will of Fate is such that we have been separated, I shall at last be his in that land to which we are all hastening,  &#xD;<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7351-00000054"/> '104   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; where no cold terrestrial ideas enter; and though I renounce him for ever here, yet beyond, far beyond, ' the foes that threaten, and the friends that weep,' we shall be one. Though, like the flowers, my love dies for awhile, it shall bloom again in the clime where spring is eternal. Though the world may deem me stern and cold, and though Clarence should think me false-hearted, I reck but little, we shall at last meet to part no more. Then speak not of other love for me. No, never shall other love come between mine and thine, my dearly-beloved Clarence. My country now, my Heaven hereafter." "Then be it so, my child; and may no clouds darken the vision of the celestial joy which you have so beau- tifully pictured, but may every gale waft you nearer that port in which your hopes are centered, and may all your aspirations of unalloyed bliss be fulfilled; and now dry those tears and come with me for a drive to the city " "If it were to any other I should plead an excuse, but to you, my beloved guardian, whose will is law, I shall say I go with pleasure." Leaving the room, she hastened to her apartment, and soon after Judge de Breuil, who stood on the verandah, whip in hand, awaiting her, handed her into the phaeton, and they were soon seen dashing up the coast. The morning breeze, as it was borne from the Gulf, fanned our heroine's still flushed cheeks, but soon they paled, and returned to their usual healthy, but peach-like, tinge. They drove briskly, and though Miss de Villerie was far from happy, you would say she was perfectly so, could you have seen how entirely she seemed to forget self, as she gaily talked with her guardian.   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      105 "I received this morning," said Judge de Breuil, " a card from Count Beauharnais, who leaves to-morrow for Europe, and wishes to know if a visit from him this evening would be agreeable; I, -therefore, thought we would take him home with us; what say you?" "I shall be pleased indeed to say farewell en personne, and regret exceedingly the loss to our circle of friends, to which Count Beauharnais has been such an acquisi- tion. He combines in himself the true gentleman and the man of the world, and forms a rare exception to the latter class in retaining purity of heart and mind, though in constant intercourse with the world's most varied scenes. Though wealthy and noble, he is unassuming, and humble-he is a true 'descendant of his illustrious house, though he is quite as modest, if not much more than one of our republican-born creoles." "He certainly possesses a fine eulogist in my fair ward, and, I fear, if he were heretofore not proud, and heard your eulogism, he could no longer boast humility as one of his characteristics." "Well, I assure you, I admire Count Beauharnais, and seek not to disguise my sentiments, and must candidly confess that if my heart had not been smitten ere I met the Count, it would most undoubtedly have surrendered itself to him.' There are none even among my oldest acquaintances who claims a higher place in my regard and esteem than does Count Beau- harnais." "A countess's tiara would well become my ward, and I shall be delighted to see one sparkle upon her brow. What sayeth Natalie?"

No, place a man like him in a rude hut, amid the wilds of our own native forests, and he would be distinguished from the common herd by soul." They had now reached the suburbs of the city, and the morning sun gilded spires and' domes, and its radiance fell alike on the elegant mansions of the rich and the less pretentious abodes of the poor. M3arket carts were returning from the city, and their owners were chatting gaily as they drove to their humble homes, while the light bark of the fisherman glided over the waves, as, with sails unfurled, he swept down the stream to his home on the gulf coast. Singing gaily, these rude children of nature passed on their way, and our heroine contrasted her happiness, her hopes with these, as thus she mused in silence. "Ah, were it not well for us if the gilded visions of joy, bliss, and dontent- ment which our vain imaginations picture forth, should iqnis fatuus like evade us as we pursue; and that we might descend to the tomb still trusting that the far-off morrow would realise the hopes of to-day. Their aptici- pation  of each honour and aspiration are as great, according to their sphere, as mine; but how far short when we have tasted the cup of reality, from that of the sparkling fount of imagination.  There is the same difference as that between the appearance of the ocean which, to the observer, is deep blue, but when put into j a glass, proves that only to the eye it appears thus." i They rode on in silence, occupied solely in thinlking and  gazing at the different sights which now crowded on   I   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      1 07 their view. All was busy animated life, the Rue Royal was crowded with persons of every age and sex, and Canal-street's broad pavement thronged with the beauty of this gay city, while the drums and fife of the W. A. were playing a martial air, to the time of which the young volunteers stepped. Dashing officers rode by on prancing chargers, and all was as a holiday. Our heroine bowed low as she passed down the Rue Rampart to a couple who were promenading, and whom   she recognised as Lord Ethelred and Madame Bienvenu, the sprightly lady returned it, and passed on, seemingly engaged in a deep political discussion which, doubtless, had more to do with Scotland's being the most agreeable place in the world for one to reside, than the States of America at this period, and of which he might doubtless convince his fair companion, who, it seems he had almost won to his opinion and politics, and who bade fair to be Lady Ethelred. Our heroine had now arrived at the residence of Colonel G , and, ringing the bell, Judge de Breuil left her at her friends' to spend the morning, while he returned . to town to meet his gentlemen acquaintances. Miss de Villerie was ushered into the parlor, and was very soon in the warm embraces of her friends, of whom there were many. "Oh! my dear Miss de Villerie, you cannot imagine the happiness it affords me," said Madame D--, "to receive you once more in my home, you have scarcely afforded your friends a view of you since spring, and I have understood that your kind friend, Madame de BEreuil, could not even prevail on you to come from your recluse's cell.

"I assure you I have not denied myself the pleasure of my friends' society for any such reason as your remark might suggest, but in spring-time my custom is to seek the society of more inanimate natures than the human kind. I spend a great deal of time enjoying the unfolding of the buds, and with my botany in hand I spend hours in wandering among these gentle harbin- gers of spring, thus I feel more pleasure in receiving my friends' visits than in returning them, as I know you will agree with me in saying that it is much more pleasant to be the dispenser of hospitalities than the recipient." "I quite agree with'you in its being a great pleasure to dispense them, but I assure you I find an equal pleasure ill the reception, and trust on being convinced of the latter. My dear Miss de Villerie, you will make your visits much more frequent, and thus afford me an opportunity to dispense the honours of hostess much oftener. And now I intend to engage your fair hands in our service for some weeks to come, and I know if your love for your friends does not draw you from seclusion your well-known patriotism will. We are engaged in making up clothes, uniforms, for the volun- teer companies, and have formed societies to this pur- i pose, of which my friends have appointed me president, Miss Bienvenu as vice-president, and yourself, sang votre permission, secretary, knowing that you were anxious to further the cause, et maintenant.

The companies are rapidly forming throughout the State, and it is only just that we should do all we can to aid the glorious cause of independence.  'Miss Clarendon, montrez Mademoiselle, the bannerets which you have made.' " That young lady arose and brought forth the ban- nerets of silk, which were made for the regiments, and, as she presented them to Miss de jVillerie, said, "To you we have left the design for the grand banner which we propose presenting to the regiment next week, who leave on the 15th; and I was requested in the name of the ladies of our mutual acquaintance to beg that you would also consent to present it." "I thank you, and my friends, for their generous partiality in selecting me for so distinguished an honour among so many entitled to that distinction, and will most willingly accept, if but to manifest that I shall not only thus prove my loyalty to our cause, but the gratitude I owe them for their kind preference. So trusting to meet you again soon, I beg leave ladies to wish you good morning, as Judge de Breuil awaits me without."

The meeting was soon called to order by Madame      , and after some two hours, the regulations being formed and the places of meeting being decided upon, the assembly adjourned, sine die, but not until they had appointed a place of rendezvous for those in the paid employ of the committee. A spacious room at the corner of Canal and Camp Streets was the place decided upon for the seamstresses of the committee, and Madame L---      was appointed to the charge of this department, while Mesdames Gardame and Millendon were authorized to receive all donations for the society. Mesdames L    ,, F   ,T --, R were chosen to present subscription lists, and to Misses de Villerie and Clarendon were given the charge of the flag department, with the request of the committee that Miss de Villerie should design the same. The forethought of the ladies seemed to embrace everything which might contribute to the wants of a soldier, and to the comfort of a camp life.   One was appointed to receive lint bandages, and jellies, for the wants of the sick soldiers, while others were to receive shirts, drawers, and socks, for the comfort of those who were well.  As the President of the Committee parted from Miss de Villerie, she said, "I trust you will have your drapeau in readiness for the sabbath, as we wish you to present it to the battalion."   &#xD;<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7351-00000058"/> "2   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; "I shall not fail to do so," said Miss de Villerie, "as the fair hands of Misses Clifton and Clarendon, as also Madame Bienvenu have volunteered to assist me in the work of love." "Certainement," these ladies responded, while Madame Bienvenu continued, "I assure you it will be a pleasure to set the stitches in a flag which shall wave trium- phant over our foe, and it will be more agreeable still to think that as many foes as there are stitches shall fall on the spot over which it shall ever wave victorious." "Ah, ma chere amie, you seem to be sanguinary, but I am happy to think though you wish our enemies anni- hilated, that you do not display that blood-thirsty feeling after all which has immortalized the Chicago young lady, who, it is well known, said 'that if the South did secede, and war ensued, she would have what she most of all things wished as an ornament, viz., a necklace of the eyeballs of Southern men,' which her beau, or lover, has promised to bring her." "Mon Dieu! what fiendish cruelty. I think a woman who could give birth to such an idea worthy of the most cruel deatlh that could be inflicted, and after death to undergo eternal punishment," said Madame Bienvenu. "Oh, no," she went on, " though I trust our foes may be defeated, and suffer for their wrongs and insults, yet such punishment, or the idea of it, could not originate in the mind of either a woman or man, but only a fiend incarnate; and all I have to say for this young lady is that if she had existed in the time of our Saviour, he might have been called upon to dispossess her of a fiend, as none but one possessed could ever dream of such a thing; or had she lived at that time she would possibly have whispered   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      1H something into the ear of Herod which would have sug- gested a more agonising death, if, indeed, there could be one more terrible, for our Saviour.

"No woman can ever entertain    such feelings. Woman's heart has but two feelings which are natural, namely, love and pity. Revenge is not part of a true woman's nature, and hatred has no part in her breast. When her foe lies bleeding, her resentment is gone, be the wound literal or allegorical, and she flies to render all the assistance in her power, and to pour into his gaping wounds the balm of Gilead. Such is woman, the minis- tering angel in adversity, the sage' counsellor in pros- perity. But, come, let us go; time flies, and we forget our banner is to wave on Tuesday next over the heads of our brave battalion." The ladies were soon in their carriages and on their way  to Rosale, where  they had soon arrived, and. were busying themselves cutting and sewing long strips of red and white, and embroidering white stars upon the blue ground.

As she said this she glanced up, and became silent, when she saw the agonized expression of Miss de Vil- lerie, who first crimsoned, and then paled, but sustaining her courage she left the room in a few minutes, but was quickly followed by Miss Clifton, who said, throw- ing her arms around the convulsed form of Miss de Villerie, "Forgive, oh forgive me, Natalie; indeed, in- deed, I did not intend to wound you. You know I did not," she weepingly cried. , Oh, how could I have been so thoughtless!

"Oh speak not thus, Natalie, my friend of friends, you will meet again to be happy, I trust, when war's stern voice shall cease to be heard within our pleasant homes, and when once again you will be the brilliant, gay Natalie of yore. Hope for the brightest, whatever betide." "No bright sun shall ever rise to me again, Cornie; I have sacrificed my happiness on my country's altar, and never again shall bliss on earth be mine; but pardon this weakness, my dear Cornie, I did not mean to beatray it and thus distress you. Come, I shall summon courage to bear the next shock, and now let us descend to our friends." They were soon within the room where the ladies were employed, and seating themselves they commenced the embroidery of the stars. "I assure you, Miss de Villerie, you deserve to have conferred on you L'etoile de Legion d'Honneur, you have embroidered these so beautifully," said Madame Bienvenu, as she glanced over the shoulder of Miss de Villerie and caught sight of the beautiful golden stars which seemed to sparkle as in the firmament on their rich azure ground-work.

I am sure, had I conferred a less compliment on our friend, Madame L   , of world-wide reputation, she would scarcely have thanked me. Nothing less than a royal compliment would be noticed by her." "Yes, I am quite well aware of our friend's weak- ness, and have felt amused at her conversation in regard to the nobility with whom she mingled during her brief sojourn abroad. I have often been surprised that a lady who had held a position in her own country could have ever so far forgotten the nobility of self as to pay the court to rank which she did." It is not at all strange to me," said Madame Bienvenu, "anxious to shine in a sphere herself, to which she was a stranger, she deemed it more politic (which it certainly was) to serve than to act as her predecessors had done, she stooped therefore to curry favour where an American lady would not more than condescend.

I am  astonished that she should have been as well received even, as it is generally the case, that those whom we seek to please most, we generally succeed least with." "I am not at all surprised, Madame Bienvenu, as after a twenty-five years' diplomacy with foreign countries, through the medium of every sprig of nobility that appeared on our shores, and the entertaining at her home of every traveller of note, she was certainly entitled to some notice; it would be more than rude had those whom    she entertained, and, for whom sle strained every nerve to serve, as well as the strain of her purse-strings, treated  her otherwise than cour- teously." "But why is she so silent now?" said Miss Clifton; "she who is always the first in the public arena; what can be the cause of her silence at this time? Surely, now, she were excusable for appearing where before she might have been censured for even speaking." "Ah, my dear young lady," said Madame de V--, "her politics are like Talleyrand's.

"Bravo, ma chere Mademoiselle," said Judge S--- , who had entered unperceived, and stood silently admir- ing the eloquence of Miss de Villerie; "Bravo! Such an advocate in our cause is sufficient guarantee of success." "Welcome to Rosale, tfrice welcome, Judge S  ," said Miss de Villerie, advancing towards her guest, "and permit me to assure you I am not alone in my sentiments, as each of my fair lady friends here ex- pressed themselves with quite as much spirit, but I was only fortunate in being heard." "By no means, Miss de Villerie; to you we most unhesitatingly and unanimously accord the palm of patriotism, and to you alone there seems to be given an inspired voice in advocating your sentiments," said Madame Bienvenu, (" but we, though unable to express ourselves in the same glowing terms and speech, nevertheless feel the justice and truth of all you say.

"I thank you," said Miss de Villerie, " in the name of my sex, for this graceful compliment; and now I pre- sume, Judge, we ladies are indebted for this visit to the  &#xD;<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7351-00000062"/> [E HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; complimentary rumour which has been spread abroad relative to our handiwork, and the design of the flag, which was originated within these walls, and in the fertile brains of the ladies whom you see present." "I will admit, fair lady, that such is the object of my visit, and I feared I would be compelled to return without gratifying my very laudable curiosity, as your porter informed me our sex were entirely excluded from these meetings; but on informing him of my septe- genarian claims to entrance to these sacred precincts, and assuring him that I possessed no attractions to dis- tract the demoiselles from their occupation, I was per- mitted to enter on my own responsibility. I think had I remained silent, I could have proven conclusively there were no Freemasons in your society, as you all seemed so intent on your own affairs, that I think I could have made my exit undiscovered, had not Miss de Villerie's oratory drawn forth the exclamation which betrayed my presence." "Then," said Miss Clifton, "we are indebted to Miss de Villerie, for had you remained longer, we know not what denouement might have been made, and it is well there were no traitorous sentiments expressed, or you might have brought us before the grand jury for these Roland assemblies." "On the contrary, dear Miss Clifton, I should doubt- less, by force of logic, be converted to your principles, and joined your meetings." "Judge," said Miss Clarendon, "I think you more complimentary than sincere with our sex." "Ah, my fair sceptic, what proof can I give of my honesty ?

But come, ma chere, bring forth this gonfalon, and I will pass sentence on its worth, and rest assured you shall have my ideas upon it in all candour, if I do not give them  on your sex sufficiently so." Miss de Villerie now advanced, bearing the flag, and firmly planting the silver staff on the floor (whose silver tip was surmounted with gold), the broad and stream- ing banner almost fell to the floor, in its heavy silken folds. A blue union, with seven golden stars of the first magnitude surrounding a silver embroidered mag- nolia tree, whose branches overshadowed emblems of the different agricultural products of the state, while a pelican d'argent rested with outstretched wings upon the topmost limb, and underneath the tree, by the margin of a lake, were discovered the female pelican feeding her young, while far above both tree and pelican were seen the stars of the OLD UNION, growing " beau- tifully less" in the dim horizon, as they were eclipsed by the brilliancy of the mystic seven.   The whole surrounded by this motto, "We live and die for those we love." Three horizontal stripes, red, white, and red. The first red and white extending from the union to the end of the flag, and the lower red stripe con- tinuing the whole length of the flag, occupying the entire space below the union. The stripes all of equal width, while bordering the whole was a rich golden fringe. Now, Judge, tell us what you think of our ensign,' said Miss de Villerie, "as all the ladies are present to   &#xD;<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7351-00000063"/> 122   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; receive your opinion? I fear from your countenance, however, that you do not like our design, if so, suggest an improvement, and we will be most happy to act upon it." "My face, Miss de Villerie, is but a poor mirror of my thoughts, if such a sentiment is expressed. I most assuredly admire your skill and taste; nothing could be more beautiful, and the warrior surmounting the staff with his sword drawn is the most apt device that could be imagined. The pelican, about to plume its wings for flight, while beneath repose his mate 'and young, is emblematic of those who now leave their homes and children under the protecting shadow of the Confederacy, and go forth to win laurels on the gory field. It is both apt and beautiful, and too great praise, Miss de Villerie, cannot be awarded to yourself and your noble companions. It is certainly the most beautiful of all the state standards that I have seen. I am only sorry that these Alpine hairs are too numerous on my brow, or I should be proud to form one of those who will fight beneath its folds, but I trust my son will do honour to his father's name, and to that of his country and state." "Ah!" said Miss de Villerie, " no doubt of that. We have not forgotten his father's claim to our lasting gratitude for his noble actions, which called forth the benedictions of our people in the war of 1812, with our more ancient foes, and the strong arm who helped to send those British curs howling from our shores 'Like father like son,' so may it prove, as I have no doubt it will in the present case."

Your memory is no less praiseworthy than your taste and genius, but I fear, if Madame Bienvenu's friend were here he would not relish the latter part of your remark, eh, Madame?" "I cannot be prude enough to affect not to com- prehend you, Judge, and if it is to Lord Ethelred you refer, I will answer for him that he is too loyal a supporter of the remnant of the Bruce and Wallace spirit which exists in his native land, to care for a thrust aimed at the breast of the ferocious and blood-thirsty Taurus, whose horns are ever ready to pierce the hearts of the weak and unguarded, and whose portentous bellowings proclaim his deeds of oppression and ini- quity.

Whatever your senti- ments are towards our transatlantic cousins, or however bitter they may be, they are not more so, be assured, than are Lord Ethelred's. There are hearts ready to tear in pieces the first gladiator who shall enter the arena, and I assure you they need no bait to encourage them." "I am really indebted to you, Madame Bienvenu," said Miss O'Gara, " for your expressions in regard to my foes, for I believe I claim it as an hereditary privilege to detest a nation who left my ancestors penniless, and who, because they could not change their religion with as much ease as Harry the Eighth could his wives, and Luther his principles, were disinherited and cast out from their ancestral homes to wander, some to Spain, and others to America, to seek asylum wherever they could from oppression."  &#xD;<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7351-00000064"/> E HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; "Ladies, ye are stanch friends, but unrelenting foes, and though I accord with you in your sentiments, they are nevertheless tres amere." "Yes, they are bitter, Judge, I own, but not com- pared to the gall which constitutes the life-blood of those Anglo-Saxon barbarians." "It is true, indeed, Madame, that their blood seems to be of gall, and not such as course in rich generous streams through the hearts of other nations. And now, ladies, I will say bon soir, as I feel I have already tres- passed too far on your time and courtesy. To-morrow, I presume, I shall again have the pleasure of seeing you, when we shall meet to present to our noble volun- teers this standard, which your fair hands have executed. Au revoir." As he said these words, Judge S  bowed most gracefully to the ladies and withdrew. "Well, ladies," said Miss Clifton, "we have finished, and now it remains for Miss de Villerie to grace our labour, and her own exquisite taste, by presenting this banner." " Which I shall not fail to do on the morrow, in the name of my sex," responded our heroine. "Miss de Villerie, we will now say adieu, with affec- tionate remembrances to Madame de Breuil, and the Judge, whom we trust to see to-morrow." "Adieu, mes cheres amies," said Miss de Villerie, and soon the last carriage had rolled out of the grounds, when Miss de Villerie sought her chamber to seek repose, and prepare for the approaching ceremony, which was but five hours off. Aurora's roseate hands were just unfolding her tissue-like veil to display more fully the visage of the gentle goddess, whose most gracious smiles were bestowed upon her votaries. In donning her   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.       125   robes of green, gold, and azure, she seemed to hasten to the scene to which the vast concourse seemed advancing. It was but seven o'clock and all the youth and beauty of the city of New Orleans were out, some in carriages, others on foot, but all hastening to the cathedral of St. Louis, where already the deep tones of the organ were swelling through the arches of the magnificent building. Enter with us reader, with gentle tread, and let us witness the ceremony. This way, for the aisles are already filled with the richly-dressed soldiers of the battalion, and their magnificently attired officers, while every pew and niche is crowded, almost to suffocation, with the elite and beauty of the Crescent City. How gorgeous and picturesque is the effect the whole scene presents.  The glowing rays of the bright morning sunbeams stealing in through the beautifully-stained windows, mingling with the red light of the innumer- able wax tapers, tinging the rich draperies of the altar and its glittering vessels of gold and silver, with a party-coloured light, the stalwart forms of the stern soldiers, clad in their rich uniforms of varied tints, the men like bronzed statues with their dark eyes and beards, and stern and handsome forms; the women fairer somewhat, but wearing an heroic expression on their lovely faces; the array of priests, with their venerable bishop in his purple robes, and the procession of youths in their dresses of crimson silk and white lace, added to a scene which surpasses the powers of description to pourtray; while rich and odoriferous incense rose and filled the vast cathedral, and cast a hazy veil over the scene, both deep and impressive, which obscured some-   &#xD;<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC7351-00000065"/> 126   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; what the rich frescoes of the ceiling, but added a more solemn air to the ceremony.  At length the bishop advanced in front of the congregation, when Miss de Vil- lerie came forward with her procession of ladies, and knelt before the altar during the consecration of the banner; when, rising as the last words of the benediction were given, she placed her. hand upon the staff of the flag which was supported by Gen.   , and in a few grace- ful and impressive words presented it in the name of the ladies of New Orleans. As the last words died on her lips there rose upon the ear a strain so rich, so inspiring, from the hundred chanteurs in the choir, as is seldom heard on earth, and nowhere equalled unless in Rome (who yet retains a moiety of her ancient grandeur). Slow and sad it rose at first, but gradually quaickening, the anthem pealed through the vaulted cathedral, and as the battalion marched out, each face expressed a deter- mination to die beneath the magnificent standard rather than yield to the foe, and every soldier seemed to feel inspired with a divine courage as reverently they left the house of God, and to the sound of their own band proceeded to the steamer which was to bear them to e  the scene which would soon, they anticipated, be one of deadly strife. The steamer has moved off from the wharf amidst the loud huzzas of the multitude and the signalling of friends-the last farewell to many, perhaps, had been- spoken, and some have " parted for years, and it may be for ever;" and now the pearly tears are coursing down the cheeks of many a fair girl who had restrained them for " his sake," or lest a betrayal of her own weak- ness should unnerve him for the coming conflict.   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      127 Farewell, brave soldiers! your wives, your children, your homes and firesides, ye have looked upon, per- chance, for the last time on earth, Blush not for the rising tear which dims your vision of the loved object you are parting from, for long ere ye meet again, if ever, the grass will have sprung over the breasts of many a loved one whose eye shone bright at parting, but whose quivering lip bespoke the suppressed grief within. God bless ye, noble men, ye are leaving homes of luxury and ease for the hard and trying scenes of camp life. Your beds of down will be exchanged for hard earth, and your only canopy often will be the spangled firmament. But ye are happy in the thought that ye will bequeath to posterity names whose glory shall vie with those of Greece or Rome, whose untarnished lustre shall shine on history's page when the poor form of clay shall be mouldering into dust, and whose memory will breathe inspiration into the breasts of the youth of future ages. Then blessings on ye, noble soldiers, where'er ye go. Among the last carriages that homeward turned from the wharf were the magnificent equipages of Judge de Breuil and Colonel Clifton. In that of the  '1. former were seated Miss Clifton, Miss de Villerie, and Colonel Clifton, while in the latter were seen Madame Bienvenu, Madame de Breuil, and Judge de Breuil. As the carriages slowly turned, Miss Clifton leaned forward to catch one other parting glimpse of her brother, who stood upon the deck of the steamer, in his appearance reminding one forcibly of a description of one of Ossian's heroes.

("Farewell, my brother, my darling brother," sobbed Miss Clifton, while her slight form seem convulsed with grief, " you have left us, I feel, for ever. I shall never again hear thy loved voice, never again wait to welcome thee at twilight's hour, when night seemed only to draw her veil around where thou wert not. For, oh! my brother, I lived, I breathed in the sunshine of your bright, noble, happy face, and now all is darkness in our home. Has not indeed our day-star sped? Alas! yes, for it is only night where thou art not Oh, my dear brother, my own dear brother, we have parted to meet no more on earth. I feel thou art lost to my earthly vision for aye; but Beverly, far from the pains and ills of life, in that starry world beyond the clouds, and beyond the tomb; 'in that mansion of whose beauty' eye hath not seen, ear hath not heard, nor hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive, there, my brother, there shall we meet once more, and thou shalt know me as thy own dear sister. Yes, there I shall find thee, like St. John, resting on the bosom of thy God. Yes, Beverly, farewell until that last meeting." Miss de Villerie, whose own heart was' aching, and down whose pale cheeks the tears coursed, gently stole her arm around Miss Clifton, and said, "Do not weep thus, my friend. I feel it is sad to part, and trying it must be with your only brother; but remember it is not all who enter the field of battle that are slain. Your brother is brave, and has proved it ere to-day; then trust that he will return as formerly." "Oh, dear Natalie, it is for this I fear. I know him   OR, TRUTH AND JUS'rIICE, ;    129 to be brave. No, bravery is not the word. He is more than brave; he is Mars himself; and knowing this, I fear for him the more, simple victory will not content him; it must be a complete triumph, or death." "My daughter," said Colonel Clifton, who had up to this moment sat silent, almost choking with emotion, "your brother will return to us ere long, and your tears will be changed to joyful exultations.   He will, I feel, win laurels for himself and family. At all events, my daughter, he has offered himself as a victim to his country's god; and though he is my only son, I have freely sent him forth to fight for his native land, and should Almighty God see proper to take him hence, in the flower of his age, and thus bereave me, I shall only bow this grey head of mine in resignation to the Divine fiat, who thus chasteneth me. Then, my daughter, be hopeful, be cheerful; it is time sufficient to prepare' for the shower when the sky becomes clouded." Thus he sought to cheer her, though his own heart was sore and heavy.  It was all in vain; her tears flowed, and would have washed to view a. bed of dia- monds had they fallen on the mine, so bitter was her woe. She was no picture of Niobe, she was Niobe herself.  "I imagine," said Miss de Villerie, "that a speedy contest is at hand in Virginia, and I daily anticipate the news of a great battle." "Yes," said Colonel Clifton, "our armies are ap- proaching each other rapidly, and the cry with our foes seems to be ' On to Richmond.'" "Affairs are indeed portentous at present, and I think this war will not be a very short one.

"Yes, this is the only compromise that ever can, or ought to be made," said Colonel Clifton, "but it is one that never will be, only at the point of the bayonet, and much blood. Yes, rivers will flow ere this." They were now arrived at Judge de Breuil's, and Miss de Villerie politely requested Colonel Clifton and his daughter to remain to dinner. They respectfully declined, and entered their own carriage that had just arrived with the other party, and drove home. Madame Bienvenu dined with Miss de Villerie, and returned' to the city in the evening, where she made one of a most brilliant soiree at Madame D 's, as she had no one in particular for whom to grieve amongst the departed battalion, she was the gayest of the gay, being as usual accompanied by her (nowfiancee) Lord Ethelred. She shone the star of the evening, and many were the envious glances cast upon her by the young ladies, and the young (old) ladies whom Lord Ethelred had found favour with, but for one smile of the widow he would have yielded all other marks of favour.

In vain they essayed to introduce the sub- ject, and though they discussed many things, that which   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      i33 was nearest to the heart seemed farthest, and most difficult for expression, and the tears' were welling to many eyes. At last Mrs. Drew, observing their grave looks, remarked, "I know not why you are all looking so sad this morning. As for me, I have never felt happier in my life; that is," she added gaily, "in the absence of Charles." At length her brother-in-law entered, and said to her, "I have sad news for you, Mollie; but you must meet it with fortitude. .Mollie, Charles is dead. He was killed, and they are bearing his body home; but look upon it with strength, and God will help you." She gazed at him incredulously, and then laughed, saying, "Ah, my dear brother, you cannot deceive me; you think me credulous enough to believe anything, but I know this is not true." Then seeming in a moment to realize the truth of what he had told her, from the countenances of those around her, she gave one piercing scream, and fell fainting in the arms of her brother. Language is inadequate to describe the grief of the desolate wife. Her life seemed only to return to display more plainly before her her heavy loss, and convulsion succeeded convulsion until nature seemed exhausted, and she lay calm in her desolation and grief, like a beautiful ruin over which the moonlight throws its charm, adding a ten-fold beauty to this' lonely one.

To tell you the truth, my dear, we also have to move; the orders have just been received by me from the Adjutant-General, and the camp is now in a stir, preparing to move army and baggage.

To the heart of every patriot, husband, and father, it speaks in thrilling language, and long after peace shall smile upon us, that page on which this touching letter is inserted, shall be turned to and read, while tears shall bedew the lines which were traced by him, whose form is mouldering to dust, but who still exists in the hearts of his people. This brief letter was traced by the patriot husband and father; it is these who speak, and not the orator, states- man, or warrior. Of his own, and to his own was it written, and flowed from his pen with all the ease with which the silent stream courses onward to the great river, for it flowed from his heart. Here is display of no rhetorical and pompous language, which so often is traced by the pen, but so seldom emanates from the heart. In his lone and distant camp he wrote to her, who was the choice of his youth, and whom he was never again   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      137 to behold, and to her he poured forth his last thoughts. Two objects of love seemed to possess his entire being, and like a Christian who, standing on the confines of eternity, is offered on the one hand a terrestrial kingdom, where he shall rule as king, and on the other a celestial and eternal inheritance, where he shall be subject of none save God; who, with the faith of a Christian yields his earthly for heavenly bliss, and closes his eyes to all, save his implicit trust in the Divine assurance, so he closed his eyes on the alluring joys of home, and fol- lowed, where duty led, confident in the noble sense of honour and justice. For his native land he resigned these, and to-day it proves that it is not ungrateful nor unmindful of the sacrifice and wrongs. From early dawn the whole city seemed astir, and now it was approaching the hour'for his burial. Up and down the streets rode officers, while sentinels were placed at the corners of all the principal thoroughfares, and with their pointed bayonets repelled the mass, which otherwise would have blockaded the way of the pro- cession, but which, thus driven back, stood on either side of the pavement, like the moving, rolling waves of the ocean, while the space between reminded one forcibly of the passage of the Red Sea. Every balcony, window, doorway, or niche was crowded with anxious spectators, who came from far and near to gaze for the last time upon the youthful hero's mortal remains.  Eulogies fell from every lip and voice, as every one proclaimed the departed's merit. Butr silence, like a spell, falls uplon the crowd. Every voice seems hushed, and not a breath seems to float upon the air, for the procession is seen in the distance advancing, and the  &#xD;<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7351-00000071"/> 138   THE HEROINE OF TIE CONFEDERACY; dirge-note and solemn beat of the muffled drum break upon the ear. Slowly it advances, headed by the band, whose instruments were draped in mourning; then came a company of cavalry, followed by several other companies of foot and horse, with furled and draped standards; then came carriages bearing the bishop and clergy, the former, as also the latter, arrayed in their robes, next to which (surrounded by a small number of his company, who had arrived from Virginia, as the escort of his remains) came the corpse, enclosed in a magnificent coffin of rosewood, and resting on gun carriages (while, by its side, walked an African groom, leading his splendid charger, elegantly caparisoned). A magnificent pall of black velvet drooping below, while bannerets and floating streamers waved from each festoon, above which were flowers of rich fragance, as also on every portion of the carriage, and breathed their sweet incense around him. Then followed all the other military companies-cavalry, artillery, and foot; while the procession wound up by carriages bearing private citizens, with the students of the Jesuit College, and the orphan boys brought up the rear, with their juvenile musicians, who played a sad, sweet requiem. Slowly and reverentially wended the cortege through the principal streets; when at last, arriving at the St. Louis Cemetery, the body was borne to its last resting- place, and there an eloquent oration was delivered over the remains; and thus, the last religious rites having been  paid, they slowly lowered him to rest, while the banner of the Confederacy enfolded him in its em- brace. Sadly rose the requiem   on the air, as the magnificent procession turned to leave; and fast fell   OP, TRUTH AND JUSTICE:      139 the tear-drops which sprang from many hearts, as the cannon and guns were fired, and they cast a last glance on the spot which contained the body only, from which the spirit had winged its flight to that " better land." Bitter the regrets for that young oak cut down in all its strength and beauty, but sweeter the memories of its twilight shadow. The last lingerer had left the cemetery, and when night opened her dusk eyes upon the scene, it found him " alone in his glory." There shall that body slum- ber on, in its silent repose, until those last dread words shall break the cerements of the tomb, "Arise, ye dead," &amp;c; when man shall don his mortal 'robes again, and appear in the presence of his God. Then, with the humblest subject in that vale, shall stand the Coesars, the Hannibals, the Neros, and. Caligulas; their smiles or frowns then none shall heed, and in the 'presence of the "King of kings" shall these tyrants tremble as their lowliest subjects. The tyranny of a royal decree alone caused men like the above to receive homage at their death, and a royal sepulchre after; but no such compulsory means drew forth the homage to the patriot whose obsequies I have just described. Love and honour were the sole dicta- tors, and these suggested to a grateful nation the mag- nificent tribute to a warrior's memory, -in which none were forced to act a part that did not coincide with their sense of justice or his merit.

On an evening in the latter part of the month of July, there were assembled at Valambrosa (the residence of Colonel Clifton) a party, some of whom the reader has met before, and others to whom he will be introduced. A sultry July air rendered in-doors unpleasant, and sauntering under the piazzas and in the gardens, the guests sought refuge from the ardent heat. The elders of the party confined themselves to the house, while the yomunger people sought the borders of the lake, where, seated on the verdant turf, they whiled the hours away; moored in the recess of some drooping willows, was a small fairy-like boat, which seemed to invite to a row on the lake, and which espying, Albert la Branche (who formed one of the party, and who was now an old and expected visitor at Valambrosa) said, Ladies, the water appears inviting, this evening, what say you to a row? As none seemed inclined to go on the lake, I must content myself on the side, though beyond in that dark grove, is nestling that little hut, with its glimmer- ing light Ireflected in the water, it looks enchanting." "Well, come then, Mr. la Branche, since you are so anxious to explore my extensive realm," said Miss *e   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      141 Clifton; " come, Miss de Villerie will join us in a row, if only to prove the truth of Campbell's lines- "'Tis distance lends enchantment to the view." "Come," she said, " wind this horn, and our Charon will appear." He took the shell, and winding a long note on the horn, there emerged from the hut beyond the lake, a very old, but noble-looking negro, who advanced, and seated himself in the bottom of the boat, and with two or three heavy strokes of the oar, which sent the waters scintillating all around him, he reached the spot to which he was summoned. Albert la Branche placed the young ladies in the boat, and then seating himself, the old ferryman plied the oars; soon they were in motion. "Adieu, fair ladies," said Mr. la Branche; "I am sorry you had not the necessary coin to pay your ferri- age, and as this is a ferryman who admits of no gallantry in paying each others' fare, I shall be forced to leave you to wander on the shores, as you lacked the proper coin, which in this case was consent." "Fear not for us," said a merry voice, "from the number that crosses, I think we shall have a much merrier time on the shores; at least, we have, I think, the stronger party, and though victory is not always in strength, there is sometimes success in numbers, par- ticularly odd numbers." But, come, let us follow the water party. Arriving at the opposite shore, they left the skiff, and walked towards the hut.

Why! quite a picture for an artist, is it not? All the implements for fishing, hunting, and visitors, too," said he, advancing to the back part of the room; he stood at a door leading out under a shed, formed by large branches of the palmetto, spread over long poles; seated there were two persons, obscured entirely by the shade. "Come, give us an air on this instrument," said Albert la Branche, as he handed a banjo to one of the persons. "Come, play the ladies a welcome to your shores; which is the best performer, Ike or Joe?" Turning rudely around, they demanded, in a gruff voice, "For whom do you take us, Sir?" "Well, from your insolence, the place, and circum- stances," answered Albert la, Branche, boldly, "I should take you for what I presume you are-ruffians; and nothing would prevent my chastising you on the spot but the presence of these ladies, whom I shall at once convey home, and then return and attend to your case, to learn the particulars of why you are here in this place, in the negro cabin of one of Colonel Clifton's slaves, and within the precincts of that gentleman's domain." Miss Clifton and Miss de Villerie, who had stepped back appalled at the first sight of these intruders, now became alarmed, and the former, trembling violently, entered the hut, and placing her hand on the arm of Mr. la Branche, said- "Albert, for heaven's sake forbear, if not for your own, for my sake! You know not these men, nor their intention. Come, let us go. Oh! would that we had not come."   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      143 Thus entreated, he turned to leave, at the same time he said--"If your design is not malicious in being here this evening, I shall expect to find you on my return, when I shall be pleased to hear you prove your inno. cence, if, on the contrary, you are absent, it shall prove your guilt." "Ha, ha, ha, ha!" roared this pair of worthies. "Well, you talk pretty fine, young gent. I would like to know if you can fight as well ; I think I will try you at a round or two; but let somebody tell us which must have kum out to protect t'other, for I'm darned if I can tell, that black-eyed girl seems to have none of the 'white feather' about her, but I cannot say as much for you, young man; it's a pity you couldn't exchange sex." Albert la Branche, as well as the young ladies, had now reached the boat, and a deaf ear was turned to this last insulting speech. They were rowed swiftly to the other shore, and springing on to the bank, Albert la Branche assisted his companions out of the boat. The party whom they had left beside the lake had returned, and they now hurried on towards the house. i"What a singular and alarming rencontre," said Miss de. Villerie. "I little presumed we should meet in Charon's hut abolition spies, for such they certainly appear to be, for not even the meanest Southern white man could be found who would presume to enter a gentleman's. domain and visit his slaves, as we found those to-night."

"Ma chere Natalie," said Miss Clifton, " excuse me for a few moments, and if you feel like retiring, act sans cere- monze," and, gliding from Miss de Villerie's side, she placed her arm in that of Albert la Branche, and said- "( Come, dearest Albert, and promise me that you will not return to that dreadful place to-night. Oh! that grove beyond the lake with its twinkling light, which we so admired, now that I look back upon it after the terrors of that interview, seems like some dismal marsh, while its light appears the ignisfatuus which leads us on to deceive us-do not return, Albert; let those men go their way in peace, they cannot injure us, our slaves are faithful, and you, dear Albert, are involving yourself in a difficulty for u: and our safety; for my sake, Albert, let this go no further." "Retire to your chamber, my darling, and fear not for my safety. I think, however, the occurrence of this evening has unstrung your nerves." Placing his hand upon her head, he bent down and, kissed her polished brow, and then disappeared through the library door, where Colonel Clifton sat reading by the light of a silver lamp, which was suspended from the ceiling by richly wrought silver chains, which radiated to the four corners of the room. Hearing footsteps, Colonel Clifton raised his eyes, and then recognizing his visitor, he arose and placed a chair with all the urbanity of a gentleman of the " old school."

"I trust you will pardon the unceremoniousness: of is visit when I relate to you its object." "Most assuredly, my young friend; no apologies are cessary; and now proceed." Albert la Branche at once entered upon the sub- It, and related the particulars of the adventure, and en said, "Colonel, I await your advice, for I wish do nothing rash, or without consulting you." Colonel Clifton arose from his seat, and rang a bell, rich was answered by his valet. " Louis, say to the erseer that I wish to see him immediately." 'Then sting himself, he said, "It is very evident these men ve evil designs, and their true object is tampering th slaves. They must at once be sought for and Lnished, though as far as my negroes are concerned, I ve no fear. These men have been lurking around r some time. I have heard of their being seen at the Larters of several of my neighbours. As to an insur- ctionary movement on the part of our slaves, I have t the least apprehension, yet the interference of these mn may give rise to a great deal of trouble, which by e immediate execution of one or two of such vile -etches, would be put an end to." The overseer now tering, Colonel Clifton, said, "Valois, have you any owledge of the two white men who have been visiting e plantations of our neighbours, among the negro bins, and who were found this evening in the hut of Laron across the lake?"

Ring for the drives, and proceed at once to Charon's cabin, to which place Mr. la Branche offers to accompany you. As for myself, I am too old to be of any service. I would be, more hindrance than help."       - "Come, Valois," said Mr. la Branche, " we will not cross the lake; we will go round it, and enter Charonfs cabin by the back way." Leaving the house, Mr. la Branche, the overseer, and a few trusty slaves, pursued their way in perfect silence towards the cabin. Not a sound was heard save their footsteps. All was hushed, and the light which had glimmered from thewindow of the hut early in the evening was now extinguished, and the door half closed. The party entered and found it deserted, save by the old man, who lay in unconscious slumber on a cot. Rousing the old negro, Valois demanded in stern tones of Charon his knowledge of his visitors. The old man appeared stupefied at first, but was soon brought to his senses by the voice of lr. la Branche, who asked him to say at once by whose permission those men were in his cabin. ,iassa, 'bout sun-down I was sittin by de lake fishin, when de first ting I kn'wd, dem two men kum up behind me, and gan talkin to me.

Pursuing their way around the lake, they entered cautiously, stables and carriage-houses, and every possi- ble place that could serve for a hiding-place, but ail to no purpose. They had entered the boat to return across the lake, when, just as they were well seated, a shot came whizzing by Albert la Branche, and struck the overseer, wounding him but slightly. Pushing back to shore, they sprang out, and made towards the vicinity from whence the report of the pistol came, but all in vain, they were nowhere to be found; and, uneasy in mind, they again returned, with a full determination to scour the whole country when daylight dawned. They reported their adventure to Colonel Clifton, but made no mention to any other members of the family, who were, ere this, sleeping, unconscious of the vicinity of foes.; But those arch-fiends were still abroad; and when four o'clock dawned, it found the occupants of Valambrosa gazing in the distance on the rising lurid flames of their burning sugar-mill, with its two thousand hogsheads of sugar destroyed in its ruin.

How base must be the creatures (for I can- not call them men), who would stoop to such vile methods to carry out party revenge and prejudices. This is but the prelude, I fear, to more terrible scenes. These are the acts of men who visit our shores with a psalm-book in one hand, while in the other, the torch and assassin's knife are concealed only by the volumin- ous folds of their cloak of sanctity. What can you say for them now, my friend?" "Alas! ma chere Natalie, I know  not what to say. I would fain have both North and South amicably united, but I feel this hope is at an end for ever.

In Virginia, whose soil has boasted so many noble heroes in our struggle for independence, and is made sacred by the nativity of a Washington, and from whence there never sprang a traitor (save one, and he dotage and imbecility will excuse)-in Virginia, I say, will soon be heard the battle-cry, .and our Southern youth shall doubly hallow with their young life-blood every spot of ground defiled by the footsteps of these Vandals, or drive them to their own rude haunts.

"Then, let it never be our part to reciprocate at least such deeds as these. Let us thank God, dearest Natalie, that we are not the aggressors in this terrible and unrighteous strife.

Yes, to him who has so signally defeated and humbled the enemy on several occasions, award we the palm.

But as it is, another fearful and sanguinary battle must be fought, and we may not fear the result if a proper force be placed in the hands of Beauregard. Blood must still flow, and aching hearts there still must be, but who will fear the issue who place their trust in God and Beauregard? Let us look when he first took his position at Manasses. Gloomy indeed was it, and nothing but the terror of his genius could have restrained the enemy from  crushing him. With a mere handful of troops, within one day's march of the enemy, boldly he made his stand in the very face of an overwhelming force.  With weak forces badly provided, his fertile brains had to achieve all. With unwearied energy he bent his mind to the task, and planned the campaign according to his condition, and the means furnished him.  The whole field was drawn and marked out according to his plans.

"Let us indeed congratulate ourselves," said Judge S   to Colonel F  ., as he hurriedly glanced over the columns of the morning journal, " upon this brilliant victory, for truly it is the most stupendous battle ever fought upon the western hemisphere; with a hundred thousand men upon the field, and fifty thousand men actively engaged in the contest, with all the most approved, fiendish, and murderous appliances of modern warfare, with all the deadly rancorous hate that low fanaticism and foiled avarice could engender on the one side, and all the burning hate that bitter scorn, and outraged honour, and trampled right could arouse on the other, has been fought between the Northerns and Southerns, planned and won by our great Beauregard. He taught them, to use the language of the London 'Times,' that Southerners are not to be walked over like a partridge manor, and that they have some mili- tary heads amongst them.' Yes, their cry of' On to Richmond' is changed to one of wailing, and their floating banners, under which they marched, are either in the hands of the Southerners, or trampled in the dust, and the grand army of thee Potomac is dispersed  &#xD;<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7351-00000080"/> 156   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; like chaff before the wind. As an army they are com- pletely annihilated. Gallantly have the invaders been repelled, and have not Generals Beauregard and John- stone well sustained their reputation for valour? Has not Beauregard won the greatest battle since that of Waterloo, and has he not established a claim to ample, to perfect confidence? To what now amounts the vain boastings of the North that an 'exhibition of Federal power would soon crush the rebellion, and bring back the revolted states to the old Union?' They said that the contest would be easy and brief if the old Government would use force; but to manifest that strength, which it possessed, would cause a change in all the seceded states, and that the greater number would be found loyal to Lincoln. In all and every thing they have asserted and done, they have been woefully deceived and frustrated." "Yes, 'tis true," said Colonel F -, " they are now beginning to feel, and we to understand, the sage remark of Solon--' It would have been easier for us to repress the advances of tyranny and have prevented its establishment, but now that it is established and grown to some height it will be more glorious to demolish it ;' and most valiantly have our brave soldiers acted upon his words. Yes, our Beauregard has won a name than which there are none brighter. With Beauregard in the field and Jef. Davis in the presidential chair, sup- ported by such men as Stephens, &amp;c., we may look forward to nought but success. Yes, we now have a form of government, not an experiment of statesmen, but one which has proved to be the best ever inaugu- rated at the time, pruned of those errors, and improved   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      157 by the addenda that were pointed out by the experience of nearly a century's test, and weeded and brought to still greater perfection by Jef. Davis, our modern Pub- licola. Now let those of the North, whose extravagant * conceits led them to believe in our weakness, feel our strength, and whose proud boastings and vWin exulta- tions unhorsed them at Bull Run and Manasses. Our foes' early victories in Western Virginia and in Missouri, seemed to sustain the complacent theories of sanguine Unionists, and they predicted a speedy annihilation of the '.rebel mob' (which term  the London 'Times' gracefully applies to both armies), but now their tone is changed to loud lamentations, and the predictions of Webster and Seward are now about to be realised, 'that the great controlling power on this continent would ultimately be in the Mississippi valley.' Yes, looking to our portion of America, we view the Confederate States as the model republic of the world, possessed of every element of greatness and prosperity that can exist in a mundane Government. We are a strictly agricultural people, and will never cultivate commerce and manu- factures further than our own necessities require, hence we have common interest and aim. We have one and the same social system, that from its peculiar nature unites us in feeling against surrounding powers, and cultivates that manly independence, boldness, and love of liberty which have ever distinguished the Southerner. We have a common heritage in the achievement of our freedom from political vassalage, and the laurels won and blood shed by our volunteers fighting side by side against the Northern foe, fully equal to that which almost alone caused Southern men to cling sorrowfully,l ,..   &#xD;<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7351-00000081"/> 158   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; yet tenaciously, to a Union that had become for them an engine of injustice and oppression. We have a com- pact and united territory, a common object, and a common destiny, and though we cannot say with the mother of Bresidas, should our Beauregard f dll 'that Lacedoemon could boast of many better men he,' yet there are other brave chieftains in our Confederacy who could lead us on to victory." Such were the sentiments and such the praise awarded to the chieftain whose triumph was complete over the invader. Yes, in their admiration and love of their general, the Southerners had been almost idolaters, and in every house was found an image of the hero, and in every heart was enshrined his deeds of chivalry; but come with us to Valambrosa, where, reader, you shall peruse the letter which Albert la Branche has placed in the hands of Miss Clifton, from her brother, who fought upon the renowned field of Manasses. "My dear Sister, "The great battle which was so long looked forward to, is fought, and the grand army, with its streaming flags and glistening bayonets, is now a defeated and dis- persed rabble. We are in possession of the field, and I have seized the firn't few moments of repose since the battle, to give you a brief account of our glorious vic- tory. "The scene opened on a quiet Sabbath morning, but the red light of the sun had not more than dawned upon the rich tableaux of landscape, forest, and armed men, when the whole was obscured by the dense smoke of battle. A fierce and terrible conflict was kept up on   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      159 both sides, and the storm  of battle seemed only to animate and add strength to the weakest arm. Heavy losses were sustained on both sides, and our shattered columns fell back more than once, under the enemy's terrific fire, but at last our retreat was arrested, and animated with heroic courage, we again dashed into the thickest of the battle, and we renewed the dreadful work of carnage. At this moment fell several of our most brilliant officers. The enemy bore hotly down upon us, and many brave hearts felt their hopes expiring, when Generals Beauregard and Johnson appeared, and by their presence re-animated our flickering spirits. General Beauregard rode through the ranks with words of encouragement, and urged his soldiers to the noble resolution of victory or death, to which they responded with cheers of 'Long live our noble General Beaure- gard.' " Now the fortune of the day seemed to change, and the enemy, ivho at one time deemed themselves victorious, began to fall back precipitately, and the last charge made by General Beauregard sent them flying over the field, where, panic-stricken, they fled towards Bull's Run. The rout now became- general, and our soldiers pursued the flying enemy for miles, but want of a cavalry force arrested the pursuit. No language can describe the mad, the wild, insane flight of these cowardly bravadoes. In this disgraceful flight, hundreds of the wounded were crushed to death, and sights of thrilling agony met the eye everywhere. For ten miles the road over which the ruthless Vandal had marched with gay, floating, and unstained banners, and with confidence of ability to defeat the rebel, was strewed with the remains  &#xD;<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC7351-00000082"/> ]60   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; of the retreating foe, which in one day had all the magnificence of months' labour demolished and strewed upon the earth. We have won a glorious victory, and though many are the bright names which will be en- shrined in the hearts of the nation, Beauregard must ever stand first, while those of Johnston, Early, Bee, Withers, Stuart, Kirby, Smith, and others will be none the less dear, while to those nameless heroes who fought so valorously, and who fell upon the gory field, is due a nation's gratitude. The victory is ours, but dearly it was won, by the blood of some of our best and bravest, and though the universal joy is great, the inward sorrow is not less so, and no loud bursts of triumph or enthusiasm escaped from the conquerors; no, it is a solemn, glorious achievement, and it is felt, not spoken. We cannot forget the noble dead, and rejoicings would be ill-timed. But alas! the scenes I witnessed when riding over the field on the morning after the battle, are almost too painful for description. There lay dead and dying around our path, and our officers were going amongst them, doing all they could to relieve them. "Observing an elegant-looking man lying in great agony, I went towards him, and turning upon me a look of intense agony, he said ' Water!' I had none, but taking out a small bottle of brandy, I offered it to him, and placing it to his lips he swallowed some, which seemed to revive him. Being in great pain, Colonel F--- (who accompanied me, and who seems to be pos- sessed of more valour than heart), said, ' What brought you here to fight us? This is the fate that awaits all our fobes.'   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      161 "He turned his reproachful dying eyes upon him, and said, ' Is this the place for such language?' "I felt my face crimson at the just rebuke, and wished myself out of the company of such a heartless, soulless being. To our enemies in the field, and with arms in their hands, or compassing our injury in any respect, we cannot be too terrible. May Heaven guide every shot, and strengthen every blow aimed at such, and may every spy and traitor be brought to a just punishment. May every battle-field be a Manasses, save in its martyrs, and may many Bethels witness as in the ancient days and of late, the presence of the Divine favour. But an enemy at our feet is no longer the target of a brave man's wrath; the captive who asks for quarter, and he whose wounds appeal to our humanity, no magnanimous man will embitter the lot of such with rudeness or unkindness. It is a very safe thing, no doubt, to reproach a helpless man. It is very easy to deliver lectures to him who is on his back, groaning under wounds. Alas! how   true is the pro- verb, 'It is only the ass who spurs at the dead lion.' But, thank God, we have few such men, and no gene- rous spirit will (except from great inconsiderateness) thus violate the teachings and the instincts of chivalry. We   next passed to one who was lying under a tree. His appearance and dress indicated high social position. By his side lay a beautiful sword, and a handkerchief was thrown over his face. I removed the covering, and I thought I had never beheld a more beautiful face. "Calm he lay in death, with his dark locks falling over his high pale forehead, and his hands clasping a small book. Desiring to know something more of the person,  &#xD;<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7351-00000083"/> 162   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; I withdrew the book from the hands which clasped it so fondly to his breast, and on opening, perceived it was a small and very elegantly bound bible, while in the front was a photograph of a most beautiful woman, seemingly too young for a mother of one of his years (who was about twenty), but whose strong resemblance to the deceased led me to presume it was his mother or sister. In a beautiful hand was written on the fly-leaf, "To my son, A   T--  , from his devoted mother. "My son, remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth." Sadly I turned from him after placing in his hand the cherished souvenir, and as I gazed down upon that inanimate form, I felt that the grave should bury every error, cover every defect, extinguish all resent- ment. From its tranquil mould should spring none but fond regards and tender memories. Who can gaze upon the grave of even an enemy and not feel a throb of compunction that he should ever have battled with the poor handful of earth that is lying before him?  "Manly other heart-rending scenes met my view, and I must confess that I was not so callous as not to be affected by the sight. I turned away, overwhelmed with feelings of sorrow and regret. Yes, my dear sister, though bred in a military school, I lack one trait of the soldier, that is, to be stony-hearted, and for this it requires a man should not only be bred but born a soldier. I can never become insensible to the miseries of others. But I must draw my letter to a close, as doubtless the newspapers will give you a much better account of it than I can in so brief a space, and all I can say is to repeat that all fought bravely. South Caro- lina's, Tennessee's, and Alabama's sons reaped laurels,   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE,     163 and the hardy freemen of the Virginia mountains, who know'nothing of the scientific rule of warfare, deserve a more lofty eulogy than could emanate from my pen, and which doubtless they will receive. The Missis- sipians, who fought with a reckless daring 'Seize- him-Towser'-ferocity came in for their share of the glory of the day, and their renowned 'Bowie-Knife Fighters' will long be remembered by those who wit- nessed what dreadful slaughter followed wherever they made their way. "These men, throwing away their muskets, met the Yankees hand to hand. The knives, with which they fought, were from 15 to 20 inches long, and were attached to a lasso some 4 feet in length, fastened round the wrist. They would plunge their knives by throwing them in harpoon fashion through and, through the bodies of their antagonists, and then, with the ferocity of a tiger, jerlk them out again and repeat the experiment until they themselves were slain. As for Louisiana, it is unnecessary to say what her soldiers have accom- plished; all the troops sent from that noble state are gallant specimens of soldiers, and well and nobly has Louisiana acted her part in this war; and still her brave sons flock to the standard of their country. She can boast some of the best soldiers in the field, and she has furnished the Beauregard. "I am proud of my native State,',and of my brave regiment, to whom possibly the journals may do more justice than I could. Victorious we have been. and are, and will continue to be, and say to Albert la Branche that while such laurels are to be won, he should be in the arena.

We must therefore be watchful and ready. "Affectionately your brother, "B. CLIFTON." "Yes," said Albert la Branche, " it is indeed time I were in the field, and I am heartily tired of a delay which prevents my being placed in some active position, where I can prove to my country my devotion to its cause. I feel a contempt for myself, and yet it is not my fault, for I have in vain desired a command, which would at once place me in active service. Yes, I must at once quit this life of inaction, and if not win laurels for myself, win them for my country. Yes," he said, and I feel that you will be the first to bid ' Go where glory waits thee.'" "Indeed, Albert, I wish to see you win laurels, but I cannot say that I am Spartan sufficient to be the first who bids you go. I cannot say that I wish it even; it is only such natures as Miss de Villerie's who can make such sacrifices, I am not equal to them." "My dear Cornie, then be mine, and go with me, and though you cannot be beside me on the field, you will be near to cheer me in my hours of leisure. Come, darling, be mine, and let us be united now." She turned pale, and said, "Oh, Albert, you know not what you ask, or how I have dreaded this hour. My mother will never consent to our union, though she has . never said it. I feel that she will not yield to our wishes. My mother is, as you no doubt have often heard,   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      165 a Northerner, and to that cause she clings. My brother resigned his commission in the army, against her will; he espoused the Southern cause against her will, and is now fighting against her will. I have heard her often say that she would never form a tie of any kind with a Southerner. Though my father is a Southerner, she will not yield to his wish to go into the army, and thus we are a disunited, unhappy family. I feel it is but natural for my mother to cling to her people, but, oh! why render us all miserable? To my dear brother she had ceased to speak, and refused to bestow her blessing on him the morning he left. I know that she will never consent to our union." "Do not despair, my darling, I shall speak to your mother on the subject; but should she refuse, then, Cornie, what is your intention?" She leaned her head on his shoulder, and placing her hand in his, looked up into his face and said, 4"Oh, dear Albert, what alternative remains?' "To be mine, darling, at all hazards." "Oh, tempt me not, I feel that happiness could not follow such an union." "Then, dearest, we will not anticipate her refusal. Give me but your consent to ask her, and this evening shall decide our fate. Be it as you will, then; I will seek an'interview at once." Rising he summoned a servant, and said, "Say to Mrs. Clifton that I should be pleased to see her for a few moments." "Oh, Albert, I  dread the result of this meeting," and saying this she went out as Mrs. Clifton entered. Our hero was by no means bashful, but as Mrs. Clifton  &#xD;<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7351-00000085"/> 166   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; appeared, his courage faltered. Rising and placing a chair for her, he at once entered upon the subject : "My dear Madam, my devoted attentions to your daughter have doubtless ere this arrested your attention, and given you some idea of the purport of this inter- view, which is simply this, to demand in marriage the hand of her whom I love, and have loved since the moment of our first meeting. I have the assurance that this affection is reciprocal, and have sought this inter- view with your daughter's consent; and now, dear Madam, with your knowledge of my character, social position, etc., I await your answer, and trust you will view this matter favourably, so that at any moment I may leave with my command." "Colonel la Branche," said Mrs. Clifton, and as she spoke she drew herself up to her full height, rising, and standing before him, "it is needless to state that I feel you are fully aware of my political views, and that I am not a Southerner, in birth, education, or feeling, in nought, sir, save my place of residence. I have no sympathy with the cause of the South whatever, and let my husband's and children's feelings be what they may, I can never be other than I was born-a loyal Unionist; nor can I ever consent that my child should wed any save a friend of that glorious banner under which they, as well as their mother, first drew breath; nor can child or friend of mine ever receive my benisolr who shall raise an arm against the standard of our forefathers. These are my sentiments, Colonel la Branche, and furthermore I will add that if I could be base enough to yield her up to an enemy of the Union, I would not wish to confide her to one who is more   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      167 worthy of her, and who is every way more estimable than Colonel la Branche, but whose misguided zeal in an unrighteous cause has placed a barrier to a union which, under other circumstances, might be the acme of any mother's fondest ambition. Colonel la Branche, it is needless to prolong -this interview; you have my irrevocable response, and I will have the honour to bid you good evening." She walked- out of the room, and Albert la Branche, not wishing to convey in person the answer of Mrs. Clifton, took out a card, and wrote upon it a few words, which, after summoning the servant, he desired to be delivered to Miss Clifton, and then, leaving the house, he was soon on the road to the city. Miss Clifton was immediately requested to attend her mother, when upon entering, she threw herself into her mother's arms, saying, "Mother, dear mother, do not, oh! do not blight my happiness for all eternity; recall what you have said, and bestow your blessing. on us both; let not your devotion to the land of your birth destroy for ever the peace of all the loved and loving inmates of our once happy home, and in blessing us may not your benediction be wafted to your darling son and my dear brother, whom you permitted to leave, perhaps for ever, without one kind adieu. Oh, my mother, you who are so noble, so beautiful, can you, oh! will you, suffer the felicity of our home to be banished for aye, by the refusal of your gentle smiles, which of yore cast a halo over all, and everything upon which they fell.

Darling, ask life, or anything of your mother, and all she has will be bestowed freely on you, but to prove recreant to the Union--that Union which my forefathers bled for and assisted in forming-I will never, my child, never; and, my child, let us proceed to the termination of this sad interview, which is now necessary, but which, by your consent and submission to my will, need never be renewed again. Then, my daughter, promise me faithfully that you will never again suffer Colonel la Branche to approach you, and that by word, verbal or written, you will not encourage his addresses. Avoid him as you would a mortal enemy, and should you meet him, remember, it would be the roseleaf on the surface of my already brimming cup if you were ever to disobey my last injunction; and were I dead, darling, remember that from the portals of the tomb my voice would still proclaim the existence of that immeasurable abyss which must for ever separate yourself and Colonel la Branche " "Oh, mother! mother!" shrieked the wretched girl, "this will kill me-unsay it, mother dearest, or your poor already blighted blossom must perish by the same dreadful fiat that separates Albert la Branche and myself."

As she said this, Mrs. Clifton fondly imprinted aiss upon her daughter's marble brow.  Summoning all her courage as for a mighty effort, Miss Clifton said, "My mother, you who gave me life and being, have the right, I presume, to take it from me when you will; I obey you, but when all that is mortal is laid in the grave of your daughter, think then in that hour, dear mother, that you could have bid me live for love and thee, and that though Cornie Clifton may have loved deeply, fondly-ay, wildly, her duty of obedience to an earthly parent, according to the laws of God, triumphed over all other feelings, and in this thought, dear mother, you may find a solace for your grief for though a stern parent, I know you love your child." Raising her mother's hand, she kissed it and pressed it to her heart, then silently left the room and proceeded towards her father's study to imprint the wonted kiss upon his brow, and receive his nightly benediction, which he never failed to accord her. Oh! how wildly, tumultuously, palpitate 1 poor Cornie's heart as she hesitatingly drew near the door! with what keen anguish did she stop to press her hands upon her bosom, endeavouring to arrest its wild throb- bings! She leaned, oh! how painfully, against the door before entering, but an almost preternatural fortitude seizing her at this moment, as it often does at the crisis of the most trying ordeals, she regained her composure, and tapping gently at the door, she entered. She drew an ottoman beside him, and taking one hand in hers, she threw the other arm round his neck, and drawing his f',  &#xD;<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC7351-00000087"/> 170   TI-E HEROINE OF ,THE CONFEDERACY; head down, the sunny curls of eighteen summers mingled their hues with the silver locks of sixty winters. "My dear father, will nothing dissipate the sombre shadow which darkens your otherwise glorious brow? Can your own Cornie do aught to dispel the gloom which seems to surround her dear, dear father?" "No, darling, the shadow is on our hearthstone, and the reflection falls here;" and pressing one hand to his heart, he bowed his head upon the other, and a large tear-drop fell upon his daughter's hair and rested there like a diamond upon golden sands ; " but," he continued, "Iet not this gloom take possession of your buoyant soul; and now, darling, forget my too inconsiderate speech and everything, my beloved, only how I ever, and shall ever, study your happiness." Pressing a kiss, warm and fervent, on her brow, and resting his hands upon her head as she knelt to receive his blessing, he spoke his gentle " good night." Raising her he led her to the door, and as she passed out he repeated his benisons upon his lovely child. Miss Clifton sped to her chamber. She cast herself upon a couch, and the pent-up stream of grief then burst its bonds, and threatened to destroy the channel through which it flowed. She rose from the couch, and wildly throwing herself upon her knees, she called on God to strengthen her in this her bitter woe. She gave vent to low and passionate wailings, and inco- herent words of agony. Alas! it was sad, sad indeed, to think that one of her years, who was but just verging on the bloom of womanhood, and when the world should be expanding before her as a lovely garden full of roses and lilies--Oh, it was sad indeed, that one   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.     , 171 like her should experience such bitter, bitter deso- lation; and yet, poor Cornie% thy cup was but half filled at this hour.

But, alas! nature at last sank under this ineffectual effort, and as she lay'upon her bed of grief, her pallid face in vain appealing to her mother, who watched and nursed her kindly, but sternly repelled every approach to that  subject which alone occupied the thoughts of the suf- ferer as she lay before her. Not that Mrs. Clifton was a liard-hearted woman, but she had schooled herself for this trial, and her resolve was irrevocable. Next to her God and husband, she loved her country, and though she married a Southern planter, her soul ab- horred the system of slavery, and ever her thoughts returned to the green fields of her New England home, where free labour tilled the soil and garnered the grain; and though her children were born and bred in the South, her deep-rooted principles could never be eradi- cated. In her early wedded days she had often sought, for her husband's sake (whom she deeply and ardently loved), to mould her ideas to suit his tastes, but alas! in vain, the teachings, the inculcations, and preju- dices of childhood and youth triumphed over the expe- rience of maturer years, and at the age of forty, when her home should have been the harbour of repose for herself and all she loved from the storms of life, she had made it the maelstrome of affliction, to which she beheld every loved object approaching, and calmly she sat to see them drawn into its eddying depths.

From the cradle to the grave she is by his side as his ministering angel, no less needed in the tottering steps of childhood than in those of old age. Women, fair countrywomen, women of every nation, would you seek a nobler sphere?

Clinging to false ideas, which neither reason nor time could subvert, she gazed coldly upon the ruin of her fast fleeting happiness, ready and willing to sacrifice all she held dear to that false idol who sat enthronded in her heart, and whose name is Fanaticism. "My daughter," said Mrs. Clifton, "Miss de Villerie will soon be here; but as she has been so much engaged recently since the battle of Manasses in her various patriotic pursuits, I fear it will be,trespassing on her kind- ness to invite her to be the companion of an invalid."

Throwing open the door of the chamber, the servant ushered Madame de Breuil and Miss de Villerie into the presence of mother and daughter, and the two young friends were soon clasped in a warm embrace, while tears welled from Miss de Villerie's eyes, as she gazed on the pale face of her sad friend. "Oh, Cornie, darling, why did you not inform me earlier of your illness, and I should have ere this wooed you from this close chamber," and again she pressed her friend to her bosom, while Cornie drooped her radiant head upon Natalie's breast, and wept.  &#xD;<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7351-00000089"/> 3 HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; Mrs. Clifton and Madame de Breuil soon withdrew, and Miss de Villerie directing the servant to draw the couch towards the western oriel, she said, as she placed the cushions gently, and laid her friend's frail form upon them, "Come, chere Cornie, unburden your griefs to me, if you will, and here, while gazing out upon rich flowers, birds, lake, and bower, take courage and remember, yon brilliant orb, which is just descending, sets only to rise brighter on the morrow."

A WITH hand clasped in hand, those two friends whiled the evening hours away; and between sobs and bitter tears did Miss Clifton unfold to Miss de Villerie her woes, and ended with these words--" Oh, dearest Natalie, you who seem to be above the weakness of the flesh, impart to me, in this trying moment, somewhat of your lofty fortitude; endow me, with a portion of your philosophic nature to face this blasting simoon of affliction which threatens to destroy both me and mine. Oh, Natalie, would that, like you, I could give up, for the sake of duty, what you relinquished so nobly for country; but, Natalie, within me rages a fearful storm, and, amid the muffled din, Albert's voice appeals to me not to desert him; then counsel, aid, and guide me, dearest friend, in the true path, be it for weal or woe," and throwing herself on the bosom of Miss de Villerie, Miss Clifton wept bitterly.   &#xD;<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC7351-00000090"/> 176   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERAGY; Miss de Villerie's own bosom was torn and rent with convulsive sobs, and though she endeavoured to soothe her friend by sisterly caresses, it seemed as though her own heart was bursting beneath its weight of agony; language seemed a mockery, as a source to convey consolation; but the wildest storms must cease, and, casting herself back on her couch, Miss Clifton closed her eyes, while the last tears from grief's fountain were seen welling to her eyes, slowly overflowing their fringed margins, and coursing down her wan cheeks. Miss de Villerie gazed upon her friend, and there seemed an inward struggle of contending feelings, which appeared visible in her actions. She slowly drew forth from the folds of her dress a note, and placing it * in the hands of Miss Clifton, said, "Cornie, darling, forgive me if, ere this, I have not gladdened your heart by the sight and perusal of this missive, which Albert la Branche entrusted me with for you. Read it, and may its contents be more soothing than my poor expressions of condolence ; and forgive me if I withheld it; I feared to interfere, dear Cornie, in matters between mother and daughter, but your grief has reopened the wounds in my own heart, which bleeds for you, my sweet friend, from every pore. God grant you grace to bear your sorrows like a Christian and as a woman, and rest assured, that He who permitteth not a sparrow to fall to the ground without His will, will at last dry your tears." Miss Clifton seized the note, and tremblingly broke the seal, then kissing it, she was about to read it; when she hesitatingly laid it down beside her, as she said,   OR,' TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      1" "t Oh, I fear to read it; I fear that Albert's pride has abandoned me to my fate, and that my mother has separated us for ever. Oh, Natchi, my friend, my heart sinks within me, when I think of the possible contents of this note, but I will read it, and learn to bear my, sorrows." Once more pressing it to her lips, she tore it open, and her eyes glanced quickly over the page. "Beloved one, fear not, though, at present, our sky be clouded, the sunshine of a glorious love shall yet beam upon us in all its splendour. Yes, dearest, ere this reaches you, you will have, I presume, heard all from your mother's lips relative to our interview, whose issue was as you feared. But fear not, trust , as implicitly in my love, as I do in yours, and all will end, darling, as we desire. Love and trust me as you ever have, and I fear not that any earthly power shall part us. Yes, for the moment we are parted, and heartless as it may seem to you, I have pledged my honour to your mother, that all communication between us, either verbal or written, shall cease, until she shall herself desire its renewal. I have hope, darling, and like Pandora's box, the lid of my heart has closed upon it, and there the bright spirit rests securely. Honour on my part, duty on yours, will prevent our meeting; but the future, dearest, is before us, and but a silver veil intervenes, through which I view, with the soul's eye, a happy, peaceful vision beyond.

But, oh, Na^thi, never, never will my mother yield to our wishes. No, she would rather clothe me in my burial robes than bridal. Tell him, oh, say to him, my friend, that he cannot doubt my love, nor its depth. Say to him that I will love on, even though it may be hopeless; tell him his bright spirit has done well to fold her wings and rest in the chamber of his generous soul; had she appeared to me, she could have found no dwelling-place. 'Tis well he gave it admittance, for, indeed, we know not when the angel is at the door. "Yes, Albert, cherish your fair spirit of light, for mine is one of darkness; but tell him not, Natalie, that this is so, tell him only that I am happy, very happy, in all and everything, but the knowledge that we are to meet no more renders memiserable. Oh, strange incon- sistency! Happy and unhappy too. What shall I say, dearest Natalie? tell me, you who seem to scorn the weakness of a feeling which has overpowered me, tell me how to veil my words, that no foolish or inconsiderate expressions of mine shall add to his grief.

Gently Miss de Villerie smoothed her golden hair, and kindly she soothed her sad spirit. "Cornie," said Miss de Villerie, " have you appealed to your father in regard to this affair?" "Oh, no, chere Natalie, I would not for worlds broach the subject to him; already his poor heart is bowed down with woe, and I would suffer my own to break rather than add one pang to his; besides, Natalie, it would be a source of strife in our already unhappy home. My father would consent, while my mother would pro- nounce maledictions on me, more fearful to me than death, for oh! what child can be happy in the know- ledge that she has disobeyed a parent, one who has cherished her from infancy, through thoughtless girl- hood, to perilous womanhood? Oh no, my, friend, though I love Albert dearly and well, I could not leave my home to follow him, with the knowledge that I left that home blighted and desolate, nor would he wish me to do so. No, he would scorn me, and justly too. A faith- less daughter will be a faithless wife, and never will such a union be productive of good. This is all we can do to repay a parent for their care,--to marry in accordance with their desires, if at the altar we can feel we are not perjuring ourselves, but should we feel that by acting in accordance with our parents' wishes, we are acting contrary with those of God, we should obey our Heavenly Parent's dictates, and never marry if we cannot feel that in doing so we obey the voice of our terrestial and celestial guardians."

" No, never, though she loves my father devotedly, she would not yield in this. I know her well, and she would not give up her prejudices for either love or. reason. No, Natalie, to God and time I trust forhappi- ness; but I have a strange presentiment, which seems to warn me of evil."  " Banish it then, darling, it is only your sad state of mind which conjures up these phantoms. In a few weeks more your mother will relent, and then, my dear friend, you will once again be joyous and glad. Come, dearest, rest your head upon my bosom, and gaze upon this gorgeous sunset. See, it seems to bid farewell to earth lingeringly, and to cast upon it its most lovely dyes and  warmest embraces, though it passes from us to light another sphere; so with you, dearest, your sun of sorrow  is but setting for a joyful dawning. You, Cornie, are unlike me; your gentle Christian spirit can school itself  to resignation, through the Divine influence of religion, while I act simply from the sentiments of duty and honour. I feel that I am not one of the chosen, and yet at times, when all my senses seem slumbering, when I feel as it were dead to the world, there steals over my soul that sublime feeling of repose, which elevates me, and seems to bear me on its wings to the feet of Jesus, where oft I have lingered in meditation for hours. Oh, Cornie, in those moments I feel I have given up for ever the world and all its vanities; that all, all is but a day-dream, compared to the glories of eternity. But soon the dream is dispelled, and then the weary round of every-day life again commences, until in some sad   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.   181   moment my gentle guardian returns, and seeks to lead me to the only true Fountain of peace. Oh, my friend, in those moments how ardently I have prayed to die ! How gladly would I leave this earth, and all its loved objects, to dwell for ever with Him! With you it is never thus,. You, my friend, seem ever ready to plume your wings for heaven, and to feel none of those relapses of conscience which must prove fatal in the end to the soul. At the feet of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph I-have indeed poured forth my sorrow, and have risen from thence much happier. Alas ! I have felt that though they loved me, I was not their favoured child. Some natures, like gentle streams, wind slowly on, and empty into the great river of life, and flow silently into the great ocean of eternity, without one single obstruction, while others course madly onward, bearing all before them, and hurl their seething waves into the vast waters. Such a nature as the latter is mine. Oh, Cornie, darling, what would I not give to possess your gentle spirit, to feel that, like you, I could 'wrap the drapery of my couch around me, and lie down to pleasant dreams!'" " Dearest Natalie, your partiality does me more than justice. It is true that I have ever sought for bliss in the holy teachings of the Church. Nurtured in her bosom I am indeed her child, and alike in sorrow and in joy my spirit turns ever to her, and in her ear is poured forth the wail of affliction or the glad tones of exulta- tion. To the shrine of Jesus I ever go, dearest Natalie, and in the arms of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, I trust to breathe mny latest sigh." " Yes, bliss is thine, Cornlie, in your lovely faith you possess the alchymist's power, not to turn earth to gold  &#xD;<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7351-00000093"/> i82   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY, but to tinge all objects with its golden halo.

"Ah, dearest Natalie, if you are the true and sincere lover and follower of Jesius, the more doubts and con- flicts with Satan here would but more surely lead you to that more bright immortal existence hereafter. Beyond the dark and dying struggle man will be for ever and completely free. The grave is the spot where he will lay down his weaknesses, his desires, sorrows, and sins, that he may rise to a new and bright existence in the realms of everlasting day. This glorious hope of finally being ' made alive in Christ' is the only true and inexhaustible fountain of happiness on earth. Turn to it, darling friend, drink deep of its waters; it is acces- sible to all. All who taste of its sparkling waters are substantially free and equal. We are all journeying to the celestial world, where happiness unalloyed will be our portion, where the ties of love and friendship are indissoluble, whose bright and enduring realities vill never be dimmed by the clouds of sin or affliction." "You, Cornie, are one of the few who were born in the knowledge of Christ, and who seem to possess that mystic comprehension of the great (and to me incom- prehensible) works of the Unknown. I admire the works of the Great Being, while you seem to under- stand their uses."   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      183 "Ah, Natalie, God has given all the heart to love him if not the spirit to know him. Suiely you, possessed of so glorious an intellect, do not feel your comprehen- sion fail on this subject alone?" "Yes, Cornie, religion alone to me is a mystery which I fain would solve; I believe in a God, I believe in the apostolical succession, and many other sublime articles of our faith, but, oh! Cornie, there are many, very many, pious doctrines that have been handed down by tradition at which I am perplexed and doubting. My religion is that of the heart alone, I know none other. If to belong to a church be to believe all it teaches, then I must say I am of no particular creed, though bowing at the altar of Catholicism." Thus sped the evening hours, and Miss de Villerie sought in such converse to soothe the mind of her unhappy friend, and when she arose to leave she was repaid in the quiet and peaceful expression of her friend's angelic face as she whispered, Yes, dearest friend, tell him I am happy, that if I were not previously, your visit has made me so." i Madame de Breuil and Mrs. Clifton entered, and the former bidding an affectionate adieu to Miss Clifton, said, "My dear, we trust to see you soon at Rosale, and also we hope for your assistance, as we are getting up tableaux for the benefit of the soldiers, and we are anxious you should take part in them." A servant entering, handed to Miss Clifton a letter. "Stay, my dear friends, and learn the news. This is from Beverley, and bears the postmark I Columbia.'

Ere dawn on the morning of the 7th inst., General Polk was informed that the enemy was under command of General Grant, and were prepared for an attack at the small village of Belmont, on the Missouri shore. General Pillow was ordered to cross at once with four of his regiments, to the assistance of Colonel Yappen, who was stationed at Belmont. No sooner had our men got into position than the conflict opened. We were, as usual, greatly outnumbered, and there were sufficient of the enemy to have completely van- quished us, had their valour been equal to their hate. Again and again, were attempts made by the enemy's infantry to flank both wings of our army, but the at- tempts on the right were defeated by the galling fire kept up by the 13th Arkansas and 9th Tennessee, com- manded by the brave Colonel Russell, brigade com- mander. That on the left proved ineffectual through the gallant conduct of Major Beltzhoover, whose bat- tery belched forth destructive fire. Firm and unbroken stood these wings for hours, but at last the centre, being greatly exposed, began to falter, as Colonels Ball, Wright, and Beltzhoover, almost at the same moment, reported themselves out of ammunition. The enemy's force now boldly advancihg into the open field, General   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      185 Pillow ordered the line to use the bayonet. The charge was valiantly made by our men, and soon the enemy sought the forest, but unbroken and steadily, not a line being broken, keeping up all the while a heavy firing, and being supported by a large reserve, which soon sent us retreating before them. We now desponded of victory, and General Pillow ordered the whole line to fall back to the river bank. In this movement the line lost all order, and they reached the river bank more like a dispersed and panic-stricken mob. However, the loyal hearts took courage with the hope of reinforce- ments, and at the very moment when Pillow reached the river, hopeless, and, as he himself believed, defeated, there arrived fresh troops under command of Colonel Marks, which were ordered over to the assistance of General Pillow by General Polk. "Arriving at the scene of strife, and seeing his men mowed down like chaff, Colonel Marks ordered his men to retreat, saying, I Boys, we shall all be cut to pieces,' when Lieutenant-Colonel Barrow rode up and exclaimed, 'No, no, never. We can at least cut our way to the river, and come on, my brave boys, if we have to die, I can teach you how as well as any one else,' and seizing the command from Colonel Marks, who seemed paralysed with fear, and swaving his sword, he dashed into the thickest of the strife. To this bold and courageous act are we indebted for the great victory of Belmont; the flank movement which gained the day, and turned the tide of battle in our favour, was made upon this able officer's own judgment and responsibility. Too much eulogy cannot be awarded him, and in after days, as now, he must ever be regarded as the HERO OF BEL-  &#xD;<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC7351-00000095"/> 186   THEE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; MONT. On history's page this action will scintillate with an undying brilliancy. This was a moment that tried men's souls, and he was found equal to the emergency; one of the veterans of Florida and Mexico lost his laurels on the field of Belmont, while they were trans- ferred from his brow to that of the modern Caractacus. But, the foe vanquished, he modestly placed himself under the command of his senior, though less worthy, officer. Modest and retiring, he seems to seek no fame save the shedding of his blood for his country, and when the din and struggle of battle were over, and he sought his tent once more, there arose along the lines a deafen- ing shout of joy and admiration for the brave ' Hero of Belmont,' as the soldiers have styled him. By his kind and generous deeds this officer has endeared himself to the rough soldier, as well as the more refined officer. Suffice it to say, that his conduct was worthy of more praise than my poor pen can award him, and in the hearts of those who fought under him on that day will ever live the name of this gallant man. This is one of the few cases which have proven that it does not require a military education to form the warrior. The effect of this movement was the dismay and flight of the enemy, who were soon seen pressing to reach their boats. General Polk ordered the pursuit, and the rem- nant of the Federal army retreated in their boats, and they steamed through an avenue of fire, (which was formed by the sharpshooters,) and up the river for more than a mile. "The dead and wounded lay everywhere, and when we sought the battle-ground to gaze upon the dead, our eyes rested upon the noble form of the elegant and   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      187 brave Major Edward Butler, who had fallen in the first charge of his regiment, the 11th La.

Butler to die,' he said to General Polk. Peace to his slumbers!' A warrior's wreath, and a warrior's grave are his! Many brave men fell, but there were none more gallant than he. A  gentleman in every sense, he won the esteem and admiration of all, and there were but few exceptions, save where his evident superiority excited their envy. As for myself, dear Sister, it will suffice you to leam that I escaped unin- jured, though I was everywhere surrounded by the missiles of destruction. Oh! my dear Sister, you cannot conceive the horrors of this war. Mercy seems to have fled from us for ever, and war, in all its dread signifi- cance, we have surely. Yet it is but just we should show no mercy, but it is only on the field of battle that we neither grant nor ask for quarter. While I have seen these Yankee soldiers thrust their swords through our wounded and sick men, ay, even in the agonies of death. The vindictiveness of these Yankee hirelings know no bounds, and indeed we must prepare for the worst, for long and bloody will be the contest. Craven- hearted indeed must be the man styling himself North- erner, who would consent to remain one moment under such a Government. The tender mercies of the wicked are cruel. The ravages and devastations of Attilla the Hun, the fanatical rage of Omar, the Turks' oppres- sion, the Sepoys' revenge, have been humane and charitable compared with the conduct of these hyenas.  &#xD;<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC7351-00000096"/> 188   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; We can now have some conception of how terrible the malignities of our foes would be, were their capacity for evil in proportion to their malignity, which exceeds anything ever known or heard of. But the arch-fiend is chained in darkness, and thus powerless; so it is with human beings. In the goodness of Providence those who surrender themselves to the dark passions of their nature are doomed to blindness and impotence. "When we look at the results that have been achieved by the South, in spite of the incalculable disadvantages growing out of the fact that we have been cut off from the commerce of the world, and forced to depend almost solely upon our undeveloped and otherwise limited resources, I confess that I am astonished at the might and prowess of an infant nation that has thus grappled successfully with a powerful antagonist whose gigantic strength, humanly speaking, should have crushed us long ago. Hence no wonder that the sages of the North laughed to scorn the first premonitions made by the South to establish and defend herself as a distinct Government among the nations of the earth.  They saw our weakness, more than we did ourselves, for we were in a degree blinded by that mysterious ' Divinity which shapes our ends, rough hew them as we may.' Seventy-five thousand men were thought, at first, amply sufficient. to put down the rebellion, and at that time it did seem to be a formidable army, especially when panoplied' so magnificently, and marching under the prestige of a flag that had never been known to trail in the dust of defeat. But time has proved th,3 insufficiency of this army, and then fire hundred thousand were added to them.

The sympathies of the European World have been stirred in our behalf, and tributes of praise are being showered upon us from every direction. In view of these facts, the future possesses nothing in reserve to discourage us. The finger of Providence has traced in the events of the past sufficient to indicate that we are yet to befree. Our situation in Kentucky is one of weakness at present, though the occupation of a portion of it is of great and imminent necessity for our own benefit, and for her own. By menacing Cincinnati and the Northern shore of the Ohio, we can effectually checkmate all further raids into Western Virginia or Missouri, and, at the same time, remove the fear of trouble in East Tenessee; Kentucky is decidedly Southern, and the assumed powerful position on the part of the Union party was, from the first, a mere farce. It was but a hypocritical scheme, conceived by her designing and disappointed politicians of the stamp of those who would ' rather reign in hell than serve in Heaven,' such men as Magoffin, Wiokliffe, Holt, and others to betray their State into the hands of the aboli- tion oligarchy. But we have all the military talent of the State with us, Buckner, Smith, Williams, Marshall, Breckenridge, Hanson, and   others who have seen service, and who are prepared to marshal their hosts around our standard.

She is in the midst of a civil warfare, so cruel and sanguinary, that by the side of its prodigious horrors, the cruel troubles in other States appear cold and tame.

All seemed in anxious ex- pectation, and as the curtain rose, a tableau of such' marvellous beauty met the gaze, that the hum of voices ceased, and not a breath so faint as to waft the down from the dandelion could be heard or perceived in that vast assembly. The scene was that of "Miriam, the Prophetess, ex- o2  &#xD;<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC7351-00000100"/> 196   THE HEROINE  r' 1O r wT v ib ,. .,  nlting over the defeat of Pharoah and his host." On a cliff overlooking the sea, as it were, stood Miss de Vil- lerie, attired in a dark crimson kirtle, trimmed with silver, while her rich black velvet boddice, bien decolte, displayed her magnificent form, rounded and beautiful as ever-a gem of the Orient. Her hair in glossy, jetty 4 braids, hung over her shoulders, and her arms were ei- t circled with jewels of everyhue and description. From a crescent of flashing diamonds on her brow, fell a veil of silver tissue to her waist, and with her hands she held high above her head a cymbal, while her glowing cheeks, sparkling eyes, and parted lips, whose coral borders displayed the glistening ivory with which her mouth was adorned,-spoke but too plainly the triumph of her heart. In the background were seen a band of Jewish maidens with their timbrels, in the  I act of beginning their dance of victory. A minute   I only, and the curtain dropped, to rise again upon the same scene, amidst thunders of applause. There in- deed she stood a very Miriam, for but a short while before had not "the horse and his rider" been overthrown when pursuing her own people? Yes, in triumph she stood, darkly, grandly beautifll, and when the cur- tain fell upon the scene it was amidst a deafening burst of delighted voices. "Magnifique " ' Superbe!" were heard on every side, and the picture spoke volumes to the sanguine. A few moments elapsed, and then the curtain arose upon a scene so enchantingly beautiful that language cannot even convey an idea. In a light shallop, whose silken sails were unfurled, stood Albert la Branche. The waves were about to envelop the frail shell, in which he stood like a minor Neptune, and   he was in the act of casting anchor. Far off on the shore stood Miss Clifton, despair pictured in every feature, her hands clasped, and eyes raised to Heaven. Her fleecy robe fell around her form like a cloud of ether, and her golden ringlets vied with the rays of morn, which threw their mild beams over the scene. !"Charmante .! exclaimed one and all, and the curtain once again fell; to rise upon very many other scenes of beauty and interest. As the crowd arose to leave, music burst upon the ear, and died away in gentle cadences as the audience dispersed. On the morrow it was found that several thousand dollars were added to the account realised by the various exertions of the ladies, and this was the fruit of this amateur display of the elegance, grace, and beauty of la belle Creole. Many  i a night when the poor soldier slept on the cold damp earth, with "scarce a sentinel star in the sky above," would the fair images of these devoted women cheer the darkness and solitude around him. And is it not indeed gratifying to them who have left home and all its joys for the tented field to know and feel that they are not forgotten? Is it not a solace for them to think that their friends' only pleasure and amusement consists in some endeavour of the kind to supply their wants? In such acts have our women displayed their devotion to the poor soldier. Each day and hour wit- nessed fresh proofs of their devotion, and when next the fair ladies of the Crescent City met it was to propose "a fair, to provide clothing for the soldiers. The Hotel St. Louis was chosen for the display of all goods or arti cles sent for the use of the country, and there night after night were the fairest of the fair seen at their - %  &#xD;<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC7351-00000101"/> 198   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; tables, selling to the patriotic, or promenading the rooms, in order to purchase something to aid the sol- diers. Here was displayed self-sacrifice, and Miss de Villerie was the first (amongst many) to go forward and place her jewels upon the altar of her country. She cast it into the general purse, and her $100,000 set of jewellery served to clothe many a poor man, whose home was in the camp. Momentarily the com- mittee of the bazaar were receiving donations. Ladies sent to be sold, as an offering to their country, their carriages and horses, preferring to walk rather than to see their soldiers deprived of comforts. The most rare and costly works of art were here purchased, and one seemed to vie with the other in bestowing their most valuable articles on those who were defending their homes and firesides. Diamonds, pearls, cameos, mo- saics, and gems of all kinds were sold here in profusion, all the willing sacrifices of the patriotic. On the closing night of the bazaar, Miss de Villerie was seen promenading with her friend Miss Clifton. They were followed through the room by a train of admirers and Miss de Villerie was as usual the centre of attraction. Colonel, E--  approached her and said, "Miss de Villerie, what would I not give to possess that bunch of flowers in your belt? I would give worlds for a spray even." "You shall have them, then, entire, but I shall not expect even one world for them. Are you willing, Colonel, to give my price?" ".Most certainly, Miss de Villerie," he said, " anything I will give that I possess."   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      199 "Gentlemen and ladies," said Miss de Villerie, "witness this sale. I resign herewith all right and title to the bunch of roses and geraniums which I hold in my hand for the sum of $10,000, which amount I bestow upon the institution for the benefit of the soldiers of our State." "Bravo!" they all exclaimed, as, bowing low, she presented him the flowers. Whether he liked it or not we cannot say, but he bowed and accepted them. "Step this way, Colonel," said Miss de Villerie, " here is the office, and if you have no objection I will just take your note or order for the amount, as we expect to close with this evening's work." With seeming goodwill he entered, and gave an order for the amount. As she came out she laughingly remarked- "I trust you will not think you have paid too dear for your whistle." "Miss de Villerie," he answered, "I would not think twice the amount too much to give for a leaf even that you had handled." "As gallant as ever, Colonel; you prove to me that the days of chivalry are not gone by." "Thank you," Miss de Villerie, " and permit me to reciprocate by saying that 'you have proven that all the rare, noble, self-sacrificing women did not end with the revolution." Miss Clifton promenaded the room with the Hon. P   S  , and though she was seemingly gay, there was a pensive look about her which but added to her marvellous beauty. Many other lovely girls, as well as  &#xD;<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC7351-00000102"/> 200   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; aged dames, sauntered through the apartments with their attendant cavaliers, and all was life and animation. A splendid supper ended this affair; and when a few days afterwards it was known that by this effort there were $300,000 realised, it thrilled the heart of many an honest soldier. The Mobilians were also desirous to prove their ardour in this cause, and soon a few of the sister city were doing all in their power to rival the patriotism of "Les belles Creoles." I must not forget, however, to mention one of the noblest of all the efforts of the Southern people, viz., "The Free Market." Too much cannot be said in favour of this institution and its benevolent conductors. To this institution many a brave soldier is indebted for the gratuitous support of his little family, and on every Tuesday and Saturday did this mother of the people bestow with generous hand her gifts of food and cloth- ing to her needy children. Contributions flowed in from all quarters, and the surplus store of every home of affluence or ease was sent to this place, to be disposed of as the committee thought best. All here were treated impartially, and all alike received their allowance of whatever the market afforded. Steamers from the Belize and the upper portion of the Mississippi river, as high up as Memphis, each day arrived laden with meal, corn, sugar, rice, potatoes, molasses, and vegetables, as well also as delicacies for the invalids. Even the confec- tioners of the city contributed their mite, and many an infant sucked its first piece of candy from the hand of this thoughtful mother. No mendicants were seen in the streets, and Plenty seemed to shower her gifts upon one and all.   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.     201 In the country or interior of the state (I speak espe- cially of Louisiana) this feeling was alike displayed. In the different parishes various methods of assistance were adopted, and in West Feliciana the most generous pro- vision was made for the destitute. The wife of each soldier was allowed $25 per month for her support, and $5 for each child, until it amounted to $50, when it ceased. She also was provided from the Free Market of the village of Bayou Sara, and by the neighbouring planters, with everything she required in the way of provision. To give an idea of how these fair dames lived in the absence of their lords upon' the field, I will just state heie a remark which was made in the presence of a friend (by a poor'womai of the village, whose husband was not a model father), and which was told to me, as I knew the woman. She said-"As for me, I never have lived so well in my life as since my husband left me, and for the sake of my children, not self, I hope they may keep him where he is, for they have more use for him than I have." This remark did not proceed from want of affection, but from a mother's love for her children. Never were the poor happier, never did Want hang her head so low. In every home in the land Plenty smiled, though Bellona frowned. True, sadness was in the heart of many, but Hope, bright-winged Hope, stood by all her children in this moment of struggle. Each and every one looked to the glorious future, and each mother saw her son a hero, crowned with unfading bay-wreaths. Fear entered no hearts, and though the strong fleet of the enemy frowned in the gulf, they had not dared to venture near the forts.  &#xD;<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC7351-00000103"/> 202   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; Shells were sent into Forts Jackson and Phillip, and were rained upon the defenders by thousands. And what had this effected? Nothing. Still our forts sent their fiery response to the invaders, and held them at bay. True, they succeeded in burning the soldier's quarters and all their clothing, yet it mattered not so as they held the fort. News daily reached the city of the enemy's advance, but the evening edition would generally contradict the morning's statements. The morning journal would exclaim "They come! they come!" the evening's "They fly, they fly!"Newsmongers were abroad, of all de- scriptions and every variety of reports was afloat. However, things were approaching a crisis. For nearly four months New Orleans hadobeen threatened, and at Shiloh the forces on both sides were soon to be engaged in another terrible combat. But still the cry was "New Orleans cannot fall, nor shall not." The nearer the enemy approached, louder grew the voice of the people in pro- claiming it impregnable. All was hope and valour. About this time Miss Clifton was plunged in the deepest grief, as also her family. A hastily written note of a friend had informed the family of the death of Beverley Clifton, whom he said was killed in a skirmish. It said no more, giving no particulars whatever. Miss Clifton bowed once more her lovely head in sorrow, and when summoned to her mother's apartment, it was to hear that mother rave madly for her loved and lost son, and to implore her pardon for the days of misery she had caused her. "Ah my daughter," she exclaimed, "it is too late now to say how I worshipped my beautiful son; it is too   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.     203 late now to say what agony was mine, when I turned from him, and would not say farewell. It is too late, my darling to shed the bitter tear when he is gone from my gaze for ever. Tookate! too late! I have darkened my home, but, dearest, light shall shine for thee yet. False views, false prejudices, and false pride have made me what I am, a curse to my family and self Oh, dearest, it was not heart, but judgment which erred, and God has stricken me, but justly. Have I lost your love, too, as well as all things besides? Have you become estranged, my own noble one?" "Ah, mamma, you pain me even by such a suspicion. Could I cease to love my mother? No, dearest mamma, it' is you who have grown cold. You know not how I have longed to cast myself in your arms, and tell you how all our hearts were broken by your coldness." "My child, you shall no longer yearn for my love, or that of any other; and now, darling, leave me to my own bitter grief, and say to your ever kind father, that I wish to speak with him when he shall be disengaged." Kissing her mother, she turned towards the door, and there encountered her father. "Mamma desires to see you," she said, as she kissed him, and passed on. "Ah, dearest husband, can you forgive me for my long and cruel coldness towards you, and my loved and stricken family? I loved you, my own dear husband, through all the changes that have occurred, and though you knew it not, my poor heart has been yearning to unite once more with my family. But, dearest, can I ever be forgiven for my conduct? Oh, dearest, I am lone and sad.

O God! can it be that I shall never see my beloved Beverley again? Can it be that birds and blossoms return to us, but that he is gone from our gaze for ever? Oh, my husband, can I be forgiven? tell me, oh, tell me'!" "Calm yourself, Julia, my dear wife, and try to forget this unhappy circumstance in our lives. I will love you, dearest, ever, and had never ceased to love you; in the grave of our child let us bury all remi- niscences of the past, and let the first blade of verdure which shall spring from his grave be but to thee a souvenir of how ardently he loved you. Let us, my dear, look to the future for our happiness, for is it not always better than to a mingled past of bitterness and regrets? Calm yourself, my wife, we have yet left our lovely Cornie, whose waning cheek methinks grows paler day by day at the thoughts of this estrange- ment." "Again my husband, I must implore your pardon. I am the cause of her pale cheek and downcast eye. Has she never told you why? Oh! my children. I have sent one away from me to die amongst strangers, and witiout the mother's parting kiss; the other I have doomed to worse than death-the separation from her beloved. Has she not told you how I sent him from her, and forbade her ever again to see him? Has she not, my husband, told you it was her mother who was the executioner of all her brightest hopes? Oh! my God, forgive me. I have almost, Medea-like, sacrificed my children to my hatred of those I should have loved. Oh! I shall go mad. My beautiful boy gone! gone! and for aye!"   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      205 Exhausted, she threw herself upon the pillow, and wept, as though her heart would break. As Colonel Clifton smoothed her temples, and endea- voured to calm her, she said, "My husband, it is not too late to atone somewhat for the past. Send for Albert la Branche without delay, and let me reward the obedience, the self-sacrificing love of my child, by yield- ing her up to one who is every way worthy of her. Send for him, dearest, and ere the sun sinks in the west I will see my darling happy. Her poor mother never again can be so. Do not wait to write for him, send at once." As he started to summon the servant, she said, kneeling at his feet, and clasping his knees, "Say before you go that you pardon and love me still." He clasped her yet beautiful form to his breast as he answered, "Love you, Julia? no, dearest, I do not, it is adoration I feel for you; and, though I may be weak to confess it, never, even on the nuptial eve, did I love you better than now. We have both grown older since then, and both have felt the icy touch of time upon heart as well as brow, but I trust that we can both say, with sincerity, that we have never ceased to love one another. My darling, you are weak and nervous, lie down and rest yourself." He gently placed her upon the couch, and drawing aside the curtains, he said, "Look out, dearest, upon the scene, and permit the evening air to fan your cheek. Spring is with us again in all her beauty, and promises much. I have never seen richer verdure, nor brighter skies; let them be to us a presage of the future, dearest." She sobbed herself to sleep as a stricken child.  &#xD;<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC7351-00000105"/> 206   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; When evening's shadows cast their lengthened forms around, a different scene was witnessed in the boudoir of Mrs. Clifton. She still reclined upon the cushions of her couch, and by her side sat Colonel Clifton, holding her beautiful hand. At the foot of the couch sat our friend Albert la Branche, whose face wore the expression of chastened joy. Mrs. Clifton said, "Mr. la Branche, I have sent for you in this moment of sorrow and affliction, when my poor heart is breaking, and filled with repentance for the injustice of my conduct towards my son and my gentle daughter. Towards one it is too late to repine; but yet there is one gentle, tender flower that I do not wish to crush'for ever. Say, Monsieur la Branche, if my daughter still possesses your love, unchanged by my harsh measures?" "Ah, my dear Mrs. Clifton, how can-you ask me this? Can you deem me so fickle, so inconstant, as to cease to love her who is to me all that makes life dear? Love your daughter? Yes, Madame, now and ever!" ( Thank you, Monsieur la Branche, for your fidelity to one who is every way worthy of it. Zaide," she said, as a servant appeared that she had summoned, "say to your mistress that I wish to see her." In a few moments the door opened which entered from the garden, and Miss 'Clifton appeared in the apart- ment. She was clad in a white India muslin, trimmed with Valencienne, without other ornaments. She held in her hand a bouquet of star-jasmine, and in her belt was a bunch of star-myrtle. She entered rather quickly, and was about presenting her flowers to her mother,   UK, T'lU'T:Hl ANUD J U'l'lJ!.  ^U  when she observed Monsieur la Branche, who rose to greet her. She staggered, dropped her flowers, and said, wildly, "What can this mean? Albert here, and at such a time! Father, mother, Albert, tell me quickly what this means!" "My daughter, come hither. This but means that you must be restored to happiness, and that your father and myself now yield you to one worthy of you. Come, Albert la Branche, and take her hand she is yours, now and eternally. That is right, Albert, press her close to your heart, she is worthy the best spot even in your noble breast. Weeping, Cornie, darling? I thought to make you happy." "Come, Albert, kneel with me, and ask our parents' blessing. Mamma, I am indeed happy, a heart too full for utterance ; but bless you, dear mamma, for this, and dear, kind papa, for your never-failing kindness and devotion to your child." As Albert folded his arms around her they bent their heads, and Mr. and Mrs. Clifton joined their hands and blessed them. "( And now, my children, go forth and breathe the air. The last tints of evening are gilding the earth, and my soul longs to pour forth in quiet its song of praise to the Great Giver. The twilight of repose will soon be here, and while you, my children, wander forth to gaze upon the flower and the tree, I will offer to the Deity orisons for you. But, Cornie, dearest, where are your jasmines? Pick them up, love, and let us each keep one as a souvenir of your betrothal." She gave to her mother and father the jasmine, but to Albert she gave a sprig of myrtle. And now we will  &#xD;<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC7351-00000106"/> 208   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; leave them alone in this, their hour of joy. We will not speak of the words of endearment which were spoken by both. We will only say that two purer or truer hearts never beat than those re-united on that lovely eve of spring. The scene must change again. I will ask you, ,reader, to accompany me to the family chapel of the Cliftons. It is noon, the dazzling sun streams in golden floods through the windows of the chapel, which is richly decorated for the nuptials of Miss Clifton. Elaborate drapery of gold and silver festoons the walls, partially concealing shrines of precious metal, on which images of the Saviour, Virgin, and saints  shine, blazing in jewels of l" purest ray serene." The altar, before which the Rev. Bishop O  - now stands, with his numerous attendants, is a per- fect scene of light and beauty, with its varied hues and gorgeous ornaments. The few friends who are assembled to witness the ceremony stand anxiously awaiting the party. At length sounds sweep along the corridor; the folding doors at the lower end of the chapel are flung open; the bridal party enter, and slowly pass up the centre aisle to the front of the altar, where all kneel. Miss Clifton's beauty is heightened by her expres- sion of countenance, which, as her floating veil falls apart, reveals her face, which seems to shadow forth the soul within, and which appears to affect the most indifferent spectator with a species of awe and veneration. In spiritual beauty she kneels beside one, whom in a few minutes will be to her, her all   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      209 in life. A breathless silence reigns until, in clear silvery tones, comes the response, "I will," to the "Wilt thou accept this man as thy wedded lord--to love, honour, and obey?"    A moment more, and Cornie Clifton and Albert la Branche are receiving the congratulations of their friends as man and wife. j  Slowly the guests departed, and the last to leave was Miss de Villerie, after again and again clasping hdr friend to her heart, and kissing her fair cheek. It was over; Miss Clifton left the chapel, followed by the train of bridesmaids, to don her travelling robes for departure, as Colonel la Branche had been ordered with his regiment to Corinth. Already our fair bride and bridegroom are on their way, and as they are borne onward to their new home let us bid them "God speed." They are now far upon their way, and night has fallen, calmly but softly upon the scene. Oh, who that looks upon the radiant arch above, filled with its glowing beauties, of what are said to beeach and every one another, and yet another world, can imagine, without a feeling of pain and sorrow, the great mass of , human passion and intense suffering which one little corner of the globe contains? Who that feels this presence of infinity, speaking as it does in the awful stillness of spiritual gloom, can return in thought to earthly things without a repulsive shudder at the misdeeds of man? The hour was fast dawning for one more struggle, which promised success to our arms, and the steamers and trains which daily left the city, bore food and clothing to the noble undaunted soldiers that stood p  &#xD;<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7351-00000107"/> ,210   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; awaiting the contest. As usual, our foes not only armed themselves with steel, but hoped to find their "pen as mighty as the sword" in promulgating false- hoods like the following (probably the effusion of the "elegant Madame N--  , of N--  Y--, or some other of her style); I will place it before the reader, who is welcome to his own opinion. "A TERRIBLE PICTURE. "We find in the 'Cincinnati Gazette' some extracts, purporting to come from the 'London Chronicle,' descriptive of the horrors of slavery in this country, and the cruelties and atrocities practised by slave- holders. For the amusement of our readers we cull the following :--        ' "'No country on the globe produces a blackguardism, a cowardice, or treachery so consummate as that of the negro-driving States in the new Southern Con- federacy. It is not enough for the auctioneers of African 'fesh and blood that they can torture their stripped victims, and commit assassination with im- punity; it is not enough that they are privileged to flay or burn alive their breathing chattels; they must stalk into the Senate House armed with instru- ments of murder; they must conspire to establish a reign of terror by means of a cut-throat policy. They must plot to take the life of their new President, while the Republic is charioting him to her sacred throne.

The worst element in the position of the Union is this position of the South, which has derived from the Spaniards its barbarous vanity; from the Huron and Mohawk, its savage indifference to suffering; and from the mongrels of the- Gulf its loathsome habit of combining   the manners of the bull-ring with the morals of the bordello. President Lincoln is called upon to deal with this seditious, turbulent, and homicidal population. It is to his- credit that he has not yet been provoked into repaying their menaces in such coin as may be minted at arsenals and issued at the cannon's mouth. "'The South attempts to treat the North as it treats its own black vassals, who, like the serfs of Sparta, are -scourged to death at the altar of the only God that the cotton planter worships, And how is the policy exemplified?  Ever since Mr. Lincoln's ascent to the Presidential chair, the cruelties of the slave-owners have been   multiplied and intensified, because it is feared that, unless a system of terror be established, the hereditary bondsmen will make weapons of their chains, and crush oppression itaelf under the heel of revolted slavery. Not in Algiers, when the Deys were at the summit of their execrable power; not in Rome, when the poor captive girl, after being jfagi. tiously abused, wasflung into a fish pond; not in Russia, when the executioner cuts out the tongue of his knouted victim, have horrors more terrible been recorded, than haveo been testified to unwilling witnesses since the triumph of Mr.     $  K   p X'?f *  &#xD;<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC7351-00000108"/> 212   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; Lincoln.

The "Cincinnati Gazette," which ought to hav known how stupendous are the falsehoods in the above not only publishes them without any denial, but callf special attention to the way in which the "Londor Chronicle" " denounces the brutality" of Southern slave holders. We wonder if it ever occurred to those pious people who grieve so much over the cruelties practises upon slaves, that interest alone, to say nothing o humanity, would prevent any such treatment of slaves worth from fifteen hundred to two thousand dollar! a-piece, as is above recorded? We suppose not.   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      213 The "London Chronicle" got its information, no doubt, from some roving Abolition liar like Redpath, and eagerly swallowed the story. The great Arrow- smith hoax of the London "Times" was a tame and spiritless affair compared to the above. It must indeed be a credulous community in which such vile misrepresentations can find belief, and the per- sons who can give it a second thought must be bereft of their senses. A few mornings after the above appeared, Colonel Clifton, who had been glancing over the morning journal, remarked, "Doubtless these are the same individuals who burnt our mill," and read the following:-"A lady, the wife of a planter, living some few miles from a village, was seated upon her balcony late one summer's evening; her husband being absent, she sat awaiting his return. A horseman rode up to the front gate, and, dismounting, entered the house, saying, 'Madam, it is growing late, and I should like to remain here to-night.' She arose and said, ' I should be happy, Sir, to entertain you, but cannot receive you, as my husband is absent, and there are none here but myself and servants; but,' she continued, ' the village is only a short distance, and you will there be able to procure lodging.' He turned from her with a dark scowl, and went out. Mounting his horse he rode off. Fearing all was not going to pass off so smoothly, the lady entered her room, and, taking her revolver from the bureau, she returned to her posi- tion. Just as it grew quite dark the same individual stopped in front of the house, and came into the balcony, saying, 'Madame, I have returned to stay here to-night, and will do so, whether you like it or not,' at the same  &#xD;<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC7351-00000109"/> 214   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; time walking towards her room door, which opened upon the balcony. She quickly arose, and, placing herself in the doorway, said, ' If you dare to enter here I will shoot you, so do not attempt it;' at the same time she drew a revolver. He attempted to brush past her, and to take it from her, when she fired. He fell, mortally wounded, across the threshold. She then called her servants, and said to the man, who was in the agonies of death, ' If you have any friends, say who they are, and I will send for them. You forced me to do this, but now I will do what I can for you.' He answered, faintly, 'Madame, you are a brave and noble woman. I cannot blame you, nor shall you or yours be harmed. In the village of which you spoke is my accomplice. Send there and have him arrested. He drives a small waggon, seemingly a pedlar, but it has a false floor, and underneath are fire- arms, with which we had intended to arm the slaves of the whole country for an insurrection. May God for- give me, but I hope it is not too late for repentance.' As the last words escaped his lips his spirit went forth to its Creator. The lady dispatched a servant to the village with an account of the affair. The other party was arrested, and his simple little waggon proved as for- midable as an iron-clad. He was taken out to see the remains of his companion, and he was then hung in the negro quarters, as also the dead body of his associate." "They met with a just reward," said Colonel Clifton as he cast the paper aside; " but I trust that God will have mercy upon their souls." A brave woman, and may all our women prove as heroic on such occasions.

"Rodriguez clasped one arm about his charming bride, while he shook his other fist at the planters, who immediately dodged behind the trees.

Mrs. Clifton remained silent, she had yielded only in her affections, but she could not yet condemn the North. In her inmost heart-cells smouldered still the ashes of the sacrifice she had made to the memory of her son, whose light would never fade. But now she ceased to either speak or think of all such subjects as politics, and calmly she seemed to submit to the chastisement which a Father's hand inflicted.  An earnest desire to contribute towards the happiness of those around her, seemed to take possession of her; with an entire disregard of self, the quiet serene smile told of the change within, and of the strength her spirit had gained in its upward flight, and longing for that world where she knew her son now dwelt.' The poignant anguish had passed, but the memory of her love for him still lingered. Some weeks had passed since the events related above, and Mrs. Clifton was seated in the boudoir of her absent daughter. She was clad in deep mourning, and grief was written on her beautiful features. She was glancing over a letter, which we will place before you, reader, as it is from Mrs. la Branche to her mother: "Camp Moore, La.

While lhe is entertaining his friends, I will endeavour to give you an account of my trip, and what the prospects of comfort are. On entering the cars at New Orleans, I met several of my friends, who told me they were destined for the same journey, and all being in excellent spirits, and in a mood to enjoy the trip, we anticipated a pleasant time. The spring morning, with its fresh gladness, its glowing beauties of earth and sky, and delicious atmosphere, added to the beauty and joyful- ness of the scene. For miles on our way we went through fields inlaid with a perfect mosaic of gold, white, red, violet, and green, formed by the myriad flowers with which the gentle goddess crowns herself. Here and there hedges of the Cherokee rose, and osage, orange, the impenetrable defence of the cotton fields. In the various trees all shades of green were displayed, from the most delicate tinges of the early foliage to the deeper shades of winter-green, or olive. The borders of streams and rivulets in our course were gemmed with smiling flowers, and the wild violet peeped forth from its vernal couch, seeking a share of the praise which the more gay and flaunting beauties of the field and wood received'as their just homage. "Many cottages appeared to us as we flew past in our steam carriage, and here and there a princely looking residence would burst upon our view, and ere we had time to gaze upon it, or consider its style of architecture, it would disappear from view, and each moment the scene changed, like some phantasmagoria beneath the in-   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      221 fluence of light and shade. On we flew at rapid rate, and though, dear parents, I was, and am happy, my thoughts would return to you, and linger around' the loved ones -at home.' As I sat gazing out upon the clouds of smnoke, or mist, as they rose and floated over the extensive fields, seemingly like the spirits of departed ones ascending to heaven, leaving behind them their earthly vestments, I thought of one who has left us for ever, and of his to be for ever vacant place beside our family hearthstone. Forgive me if I have pained you by referring to this, but I could not write home without giving a thought to him. It was but a few hours ere we arrived at this place, and though it is not the point for which we started, Albert thought it best we should stop here to rest for a day or so, and, besides, we both have many friends here. "This, you are aware, is what its name implies, and hundreds of soldiers surround the village. Constantly troops are arriving and departing from this point, and you cannot conceive how picturesque the scene which presents itself to the eye, as one views the panorama- like tableau. The two hotels (or, to give them their proper names, inns) are the chief buildings in the place, and one stands on either side of the railroad, and when- ever the cars arrive, a stream of individuals pour into the open doors of the road mansion. A negro generally appears at this moment on the gallery of each, and rings a bell in the most scientific manner, whichlthe tired, and generally famished, travellers hail as the sweetest of music.

You will be surprised, dear mother and father, when I tell you that here we are not put to the trouble of making dinner toilette, and that I find my travelling attire more than stylish enough for the rustic mode of apparel which I perceive here. Albert has returned to escort me to the table d'hote, and I will not close until we return from dinner. "Oh, dear parents, you cannot imagine what a truly Lacedemonian meal I have just partaken of!  One, indeed, must be patriotic to subsist on such fare. Albert, however, ate without comment, and says it is all that a true soldier requires. I tried, for Albert's sake, to eat something, but I hope to cultivate a taste for the ' black broth.' I am sure I can do anything for my Albert's sake. Come what may, I am prepared to meet want, and even beggary, with him.

"Forget not our wounded companions, who stood In the day of distress by our side ; While the moss of the valley grew red with their blood, They stirr'd not, but conquered and died. That sun which now blesses our arms with his light, Saw them fall upon Ossory's plain;- Oh! let him not blush, when he leaves us to-night, To find that they fell there in vain." THE spring has again appeared, and ere we raise the curtain upon the principal events of '62 we will just glance over a few incidents worthy of note in the closing pages of last year's records. From the first gun fired at Fort Sumpter to the last boom of the cannon at Belmont in that same year, the "Rebels" were, with slight exceptions, the victors. Many martyrs were added to the list upon which the noble Jackson's name must ever be the first, and many were they who met with the fate of the ruffian Ellsworth, when daring to seize upon 'Southern trophies." A monument was proposed to the Hero of Alexandria, and a grateful people contributed towards the wants of his bereaved family. But the wild storm of despotism which has swept over the sunny South has left no traces of even the tombs of those' whose obscure position should have   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.     225 rendered them sacred. Churches and cemeteries alike were spoiled lby the invader, and for this reason the idea of erecting monuments to the memory of the martyred dead is abandoned for the present. The battles of Bethel, Rich Mountain, Bull Run, Manasses, Carthage, Oak Hill, Lexington, Leesburg, and Belmont, had been fought, and, with the exception of the second named, they were all brilliant Southern victories. Among the heroes whose names should be engraven on all hearts are Generals Garnett and Bee, as also Colonels Bartow and Fisher, who fell nobly upon the battle-field. General Bee must ever be remembered, not only for his valour, but his having bestowed upon noble General Jackson the suggestive name of *' Stone- wall," and by which he is, and will ever be, most gene- rally known (Thomas F. Jackson). But the last month of the y'ear '61 (December) will long be remembered as that in which the outrage of the Federal vessel, the San Jacinto (Commander Wilkes), to the British flag, in the seizure of the Confederate Commissioners, James M. Mason, of Virginia, and Hon. John Slidell, of Louisiana, and their Secretaries, Messrs. Eustis and M'Farland, who were passengers on board H M.S S. The Trent, commanded by Captain Mann. The day after she had sailed from Havannah she was intercepted by the Federal steam.-frigate above named, and brought-to by a shotted gun, and then boarded by an armed crew; when the persons of the Messrs. Slidell, Mason, Eustis, and M'Farland were demanded, but these gentlemen refusing to leave it, except at the instance of physical force (and claiming British protection), were informed by Lieutenant Fairfax that he was ready to use it. The Q  &#xD;<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC7351-00000115"/> 226   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; Commander of the Trent made many protests against such a piratical seizure of Ambassadors under a neutral flag; but all of no avail, and the Trent, being an unarmed vessel, could make no resistance. The Com- missioners, with their Secretaries, were taking leave of their friends, and the Hon. John Slidell had gone into his state-room to take leave of his family, when Miss Slidell stationed herself in the doorway, to prevent intrusion on the leave-taking of her parents. At this moment Lieutenant Fairfax appeared, and wished to force an entrance into the room, at the door of which Miss Slidell was posted as sentinel (an office which she proved herself worthy of), when that young lady re- marked, "You cannot, nor shall not, enter, Sir!" Telling her to stand aside, and endeavouring to force her from her position, the noble girl resented the affront by boxing his ears, thus recalling to mind the action of Cleopatra, who slapped Seleucus, and proving to us that "the most beautiful are most brave." Had it not been, however, for the interference of the British officers on board, Miss Slidell would probably have felt the effects of her rashness, as the chivalrous Lieutenant ordered his men to bayonet her upon the spot. Then numberless cheers for the fair Rebel and modern Cleopatra, and may such examples not be lost upon every Southern woman when called upon in such emer- gencies. This act, instead of crushing the hopes of our people, brought only renewed confidence in the almost worn out expectations of "'foreign intervention," and these ideal dreams were proven vain, when, at the demand of the English Government, the persons of the "Trent arrest" affair were delivered up and sent on   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      227 their way. The ludicrous statements of Seward, in his letter to iEarl Russell, that " the safety of the Union did not require the detention of the captured persons, and that an effectual check had been put to the existing 'insurrection,' and that its waning proportions made it no longer a subject of serious consideration," were shown to be false, and yet it contained an element of truth. Our people, elated with their success in arms, had felt confident that "foreign intervention" would speedily arrive, and that "King Cotton" would soon wave his sceptre triumphant. But at the close of this year it was evident how useless, how worse than vain, our hopes of any aid, save God's and right.   The Southern people, no longer buoyed up with such expec- tations, nerved themselves, and prepared for a long and bloody contest, to conquer or to die, and felt that the battle-field alone would decide their fate. Our sick and wounded at this period were deprived of many articles necessary for their comfort, and the blockade now com- menced to be felt. Diseases of all kinds were daily making their inroads into the army of the Potomac and Western Virginia, as also among the troops at Chute Mountains and the Kenawha Valley. The dampness, exposure, changeable climate, cold, and rain, want of tents, suitable food and clothing, were producing their effects, and the many nameless graves which surround the numerous camping grounds on the borders of our rivers, in our sombre forests, and in the wilds of our mountains, tell of those "unnoticed heroes" whose last days were passed in sacrificing on the altar of their country their love of home and friends.

At this date in our history the folds of the Anaconda seemed tightening around the brave armies of the Confederacy, and a ruthless foe seemed to gloat in anticipation of their ruin; but they were dis- appointed, and found our noble soldiers undismayed, and prepared to gird up their loins deliberately, and determinedly to drive the Abolition hordes from our borders. The prospects of hunger, cold, and heat did not make them shrink; the wealthy planter and his sons went forth, as freely yielding up the comforts of luxurious homes as the day-labourer did his humble but happy abode. The issue will prove how a just God repaid them for this self-sacrifice, and that time and suf- fering but proved themt worthy of the success which they felt awaited them. ,/   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.        229 CHAPTER XV. "This battle fares like to the morning's war, When dying clouds contend with growing light; What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails, Can neither call it perfect day, or night." " Farewell!-God knows, when we shall meet again. I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins, That almost freezes up the heat of life." "Oh! fair as the sea-flower close to the growing, How light was thy heart, till love's witchery came, Like the wind of the south o'er a summer lute blowing, And hush'd all its music, and wither'd its frame! "And still when the merry date-season is burning, And calls to the palm-groves the young and the old, The happiest there, from this pastime returning At sunset, will weep when thy story is told." THE morning of the 6th of April, 1862, opened upon a scene that will long be remembered; and, for thrilling incident in the history of the Southern Confederacy, must ever beam upon its pages in letters of flame. For some time this engagement had been looked forward to with eagerness as to its result, and it was with a shout of joy the forces under command of Generals Hardie, Bragg, Beauregard, and Johnston were informed that the hour had arrived for the attack.  &#xD;<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC7351-00000117"/> 230   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; The evening previous to the battle of Shiloh, there had been considerable skirmishing, and early on the morning of the 6th, General Hardie made an advance upon the enemy's camp, who were completely taken by surprise, and, some in demi-toilette, and others cooking their breakfasts, were instantly compelled to cease all :opera- tions, and form themselves into line of battle, to meet our forces who were now advancing from every direc- tion. The spirits of the Confederates were high and buoyant, and the trumpet-notes rang merrily through hill and dale, while the rattle of the infantry drums sounded sharply from the wooded glens, and the bayonets flashed in the morning light, with the Con- federate standard waving proudly above them. As the " rebel " columns advanced towards the foe, many a love-lit eye looked its last upon the beautiful scenery which met its view at every step. Charming the varied scene of hill and dell, rock, lakes, and streams, with now and then the gray gables of the farm-houses peeping forth from the groves of stately trees that screened them from the travellers' sight on the highl-road. The wild-rose and honeysuckle per- fumed the air, as arching over tihe road they twined their luxurious tendrils with some sister plant, thus forming a triumphal archway, under which, on that morning, some passed to death, but most to victory. Argentine streams wound among the forests, and upon the grassy banks grazed herds of cattle. As the army passed on, it was cheered in its progress by the encouraging voices that rang out from   the cottages by the road side, and each vowed to perish in   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      231 defending this beautiful land. All nature was beautiful --the mists were rolling away from the sun-lit earth, and the odour of spring blossoms floated upon the fresh morning air. Nature seemed to wear her brightest and most resplendent robes, in honour of those whose eyes might close upon her beauties for ever; and the boom of the cannon which now pealed across the sky, told that the strife had commenced. Smoke curled in shell- like ridges along the hill sides, and soon the bloody conflict was at its height., From six o'clock the battle was deadly; and though each fought with desperation, the brave and disciplined Federal troops could not resist the valour of the Con- federates, who dashed upon the advancing foe like angry waves, and meeting with resistance, were only forced back to return with renewed strength and fury; like chaff before the wind, they fell and strewed the earth, whle their broken ranks rallied behind trees or underwood, only to meet the same fate afterwards. Awfully sublime grew the scene. Shells bursting into flame, and scattering their meteor-lights high in air, while the sharp crack of their report startled the dwellers of the wood, as they burst far beyond the scene of action; peals of musketry rose upon the ear, while dead and dying strewed the ground. Examples of reckless daring met the view, and into the very mouth of gaping fire would the "rebel" soldiers dash with mad determination. Officers' and soldiers alike won laurels of unfading glory; and, as clouds of smoke rolled away, the form of some brave fellow would be seen mangled beneath the feet of his comrades. Among the first who fell was the commandertin-  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC7351-00000118"/> 232   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; chief, General Albert Sidney Johnston, who was wounded in the calf of, the right leg, and soon after reeling in his saddle, fell from his horse, and in a few moments expired. The knowledge of his fall was kept from the army until the day was secured; and there, amid the cheers of a victorious army, and the roar of artillery, the noble all-lamented hero breathed his last. Among others whose names deserve more than a. passing notice, were General Gladden, of South Caro- lina; George M. Johnston (Provisional Governor of Kentucky); as also Colonels Adams, of Louisiana; Kitt Williams, of Tennessee; and Blythe, 'of Mississippi. Among the lesser grade, the slain were too numerous to mention; but as the noble Captain J. T. Wheat was so well known, and so well-beloved in Louisiana, it is only just to mention him. Native of Virginia, he entered the army the moment the first threat of subjugation came from the North. He had the honour of being secretary of the Louisiana Convention, His brother Robert, noted as Cuban Fili- buster, was wounded at Manasses, but recovered and entered again upon duty, and was soon after killed. He was associated also with Walker in the expedition to Nicaragua. The Confederate victory was complete. The entire encampment of the enemy was taken possession of by them, and they found the fruits of their day's labour immense; an abundance of forage and munitions of war, as also a great amount of clothing, fine blankets, and numerous tents, repaid them for the latter which they had thrown away in their wearisome march. Sunday night General Beauregard established his   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      233 head-quarters at the rude log-church of Shiloh, and tle troops were ordered to sleep upon their arms, but the time had now come for feasting upon the spoils, and all night long soldiers and citizens were seen robbing and plundering. Disgraceful as this is to an army, there may be an excuse for such conduct on the side of the Confederates, as they, being deprived for so long a time of even the necessaries of life, they could but hail with gladness the moment such prizes were within reach. Before we condemn, let us not boast of strength to conquer temptation such as our hearts have never felt; it is only those who are exposed to the heat of the furnace, that can judge of its intense heat. Monday morning found the enemy reinforced, and the Confederates much demoralised by their night of feasting and revelry; notwithstanding they bared their bosoms to the strife 'and fought valorously, until Beau- regard ordered a retreat, which was executed with steadiness. General Breakinridge, who had been ordered to cover the retreat, stood guard and vigil, with his little band prepared, if necessary, like Leonidas at the pass of Thermopyloe, to hold the enemy in check, if it required the sacrifice of his- last man. The enemy, already sorely chastised, did not pursue, but Breakinridge and his noble heroes are not deserving of the less praise. Beauregard retired to Corinth, intending to make that place the strategic point of his campaign. But let us return to the field of battle, which presented a frightful scene of slaughter. The whole earth was strewn with ghastly corpses, and fthe dying who had fallen among horses, muskets, swords, drums, and haversacks; many of whom were in agony, moaning and entreating, for  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC7351-00000119"/> 234   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; water, or begging that some kind hand would kill them outright, and thus end their pain. Many had died whose wounds were slight, from exposure and want of attention. The calmness of the descending dew revived some, while to others it sent a chill, as they struggled in the cold embraces of Death. Alas! a sad and strange sight is that of a battle field--all those who were, ere yesterday, strangers to each other, now lying side by side on their sanguine couch, and taking their eternal sleep together. A scene of horror from which the coldest turns with a shudder, while gazing upon .the distorted visages and discoloured features of the dead, over which insects were creeping, and from which there now rose a miasma foul and sickening. With morning came many women, the mothers, wives, sisters, and friends of the soldiers, to search among the slain for the beloved ones, gone to return no more, and their shrieks, sobs, and wild cries, mingled with the moans of the dying, sent a pang to the heart of the observer, and deeply did the arrow of sympathy enter the soul for those who died alone and uncared for. There they wandered over that field of carnage, some with dishevelled hair, blood- shot eyes, and blanched cheeks, searching out from the already decaying mass of human beings, the loved and brave. Oh! the sight was heartrending. Apart from the rest of the bodies lay the form of a young man, beautiful even in death, and over which a young and lovely woman was bending. Her face was of an ashen hue, and her eyes were tearless, but in them a wild stare, as she cast them upon the body before her. She seized the arm of the dead man, and endeavoured to place it around her neck, but, alas, its stiffened state rendered   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      235 it impossible, then kissing its hands, she madly cast her- self on the body, and pressed her lips to the cold fore- head. "Albert, Albert," she murmured, "ask of God to take me too." The most callous-hearted wept at this scene of deso- lation, and seeing her endeavour to re-enfold him to her heart, her friends approached, and as they essayed to draw her from the scene, by pleadings and gentle force, she fell fainting upon the body, and was borne from the spot in the arms of her friends. Reader, do you recognise the characters? They are Albert and Cornie, and soon the curtain must drop for ever upon two whom I feel you have followed with some interest this far. - Yes, Albert la Branche was in the thickest of the glorious strife, and fell upon the last day. He had taken a fond farewell of his bride that morning, confident in his promise of returning as soon as the conflict was passed, and had kissed her at the cottage door of the rustic abode in which they had taken up their quarters. Anxiously she had watched and awaited the couriers, as they almost momentarily dashed by, and when Monday passed and no hastily-scribbled line told her of his safety, unheeding the counsel of her friends, she flew to the battle-field, and now the reader, if he will, may witness her last hours. Sadly her friends bore her to her couch, and weep- ingly they pressed around her inanimate form, that they might assist in restoring her to consciousness. Thus she lay for hours, seemingly dead, with her icy gaze rivetted upon them. No sound escaped her lips, but at length her breast heaved with heavy sighs, and the tears  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC7351-00000120"/> E HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; stole quietly down her cheeks from that now unsealed fountain in her heart. Tenderly they watched her, and silently she thanked them, while now and then she pressed their hands to her heart, or smiled upon them in her almost seraphic beauty. But the canker worm was at her heart, and momentarily they saw her fading away. Her parents were summoned, and they came and stood beside her, and that mother, now crushed and broken.. hearted, no longer raved, but bowed to the Divine will, which seemed not to feel satisfied with the already brimming chalice which she had drained to the dregs. There lay that fragile flower-the blessed, the loved, and cherished; she was passing "to that bourne from whence no traveller returns," and to that land "where never sounds farewell." She gazed lingeringly upon the departing sun, and watched the shadows of the vine-lines, which drooped in festoons from the doors and windows of the room she occupied, and when the last gleam of sunlight departed, with it her spirit fled, to shed its light and radiance on another world. Her deli- cate hands were clasped upon her breast, and her cheek shone with a hue unlike that of death. The dark and troubled waves were stilled; the lamp had gone out, and her soul had gone forth to meet the kindred spirit that stood awaiting it. The harps of heaven were hushed, and darkness spread her pall over the scene. Wrapt in gloom sat the pale watchers by the dead- father and mother. They shed no tears, for they felt their darling was now in her proper sphere-an angel in heaven as she had been on earth. But while these events were passing, other scenes were being enacted in the various portions of the Confederacy, which cast   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.   an additional lustre upon the Confederate arms. The commencement of the year '62 was disastrous to the Southern cause, and though many battles were fought, few were termed victorious. Many of our brave men had fallen upon the various battle-fields, and in particular Virginia's soil was crimsoned with the blood of her heroes. Tennessee had felt the foot of the invader, and Nashville was occupied by the enemy. Her citizens turned out of doors, and her most palatial residences possessed by the hordes of hirelings that composed the Federal army. Not content with confiscating property, the vilest insults were offered to the families of those brave men whom duty to their country left their families unpro- tected and exposed to their tender mercies. Arrests were daily made, and a repetition of the Washington style of espionage was instituted. Mrs. Greenhow and family's treatment was but tame in comparison with that of many others, and the most sacred privileges of the female sex were wrested from them, and private correspondence of every nature was laid open to the world. No family was deemed secure from intrusion at any hour, night nor day, and though the ladies feared the brutality of those in command, they ever displayed a defiant spirit when face to face with their jailors. Many fled their homes to return no more, and the man- sions that a few weeks before blazed with light, and in whose halls echoed happy voices, were now dark and desolate, and the floors soiled with the dust shaken from the feet of the blood-thirsty invaders. Those who remained, however, spurned all attempts at recognition, or effort of social intercourse with the Yankees.

No condescension on the part of the inhabitants was mani- fested, and the insulting foe was soon taught that "stone walls do not a prison make," so that the mind be free. The enemy was harassed in every manner, and the dashing and intrepid cavalier, Captain John H. Morgan* (since ColoneD, was every day performing deeds of valour which, for strategy and boldness, rivalled all the daring exploits of the time.

OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      2kB wondrous adventures related.  His name was long known, and already historically, when the war broke out, and Texas looked to him as one of her strongest pillars of defence. On the field of San Jacinto and Mexico he had won unfading laurels, and in later days he was known as the "Texas Ranger."  This noble man joined his fortunes with those of the Confederacy, and was killed at the battle of Elk Horn; standing on a slight elevation, he was marked by one of the sharp- shooters of the enemy from his conspicuous dress, which was a black velvet suit, patent leather high-top boots, and on his head a light-coloured broad-brimmed hat. His death was regarded as a national calamity, and General Van Dorn, in his official report, declared that no successes could repair the loss of the gallant dead who had fallen on the well-fought field. in this engagement General McIntosh also fell, shot through the heart; but in hastily reviewing those events I will not forget to pay a just tribute to the gallant veteran, Major-General Price, and his brave troops, who had won glory on other fields than Elk Horn. A more gallant commander than General Price the Confederate army could not boast of, and not only for his bravery and military skill was he remembered, but for his noble heart and tender sentiments. On many occasions this hardy warrior gave evidence of his humane feelings, but particularly on his retreat at the battle of Elk Horn, and I can give no better idea of it than quoting the exact words of the historian: - In the progress of the re- treat," writes an officer, " every few hundred yards we would overtake some wounded soldier. As soon as he saw the old General he would cry out, ' General, I am  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC7351-00000122"/> 240   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; wounded!' Instantly some vehicle was ordered to s+op, and the poor soldier's wants cared for. Again and again it occurred, until our conveyances were covered with the wounded. Another one cried out, 'General, I am wounded!' The General's head dropped upon his breast, and his eyes, bedimmed with tears, were thrown up, and he looked in front, but could see no place to put his poor soldier. He discovered something on wheels in front, and commanded-' Halt, and put this wounded soldier up; by G--d, I will save my wounded, if I lose . the whole army!'" This explains why the old man's   poor soldiers love him so well. But even he is not without his enemies, nor his brave soldiers, and it has been frequently asked, "Who are Price's men?" and, to quote in compliment to Missouri's soldiers, we reply, "These veteran soldiers never falter in battle. They are never whipped! They do not seek sick furloughs.  They do not straggle. When batteries are to be taken, they take them! When an enemy is to be routed, they charge him with a shout of defiance. They have met the foe on fifty battle-fields! They may be killed, but they cannot be conquered! These are ' Plice's men!" General Price had under his command troops from Arkansas, Mississippi, Texas, Louisiana, and Tennessee, as well as those of Missouri; and when, after the battle of Shiloh, it was resolved to consolidate the armies of Price and Van Dom with that of Beauregard, the call was responded to with the most self-sacrificing spirit by the Missourians and Arkansans.

General Price's address to his army, though properly belonging to history, I cannot resist introducing here, teeming, as it does, with beauty, patriotism, and flow of soul, which seems to have gushed forth from his honest, manly heart in unfettered language, .like one of the mighty streams of his native State :- "Head Quarters Missouri State Guard, "Des Moines Arkansas, April 3rd, 1862.

THE morning of the 24th of April, '62 dawned upon the most important event of the times.   An event that   will long be remembered, and  one that cast gloom  over the whole Confederacy.                     On 0  &#xD;<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7351-00000124"/> 244   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; New Orleans had long been considered an impreg- nable point, and the inhabitants had considered them- selves perfectly secure in their defences of coast and river. Vast sums had been expended on the river batteries, and the city itself was supposed to be occupied by a large and well-disciplined force under command of General Lovell, and in its harbour was a fleet consist- ing of twelve gun-boats, one iron-clad steamer, and the famous ram "Manasses." The outer line of defences were Forts Jackson and St. Phillip, some sixty miles below the city, and General Duncan, who was said to be the best artillerist in the Confederate service, was in command. The bombardment of these forts by the Federal fleet, had continued some time without much damage, and though 25,000 thirteen-inch shells had been thrown within the forts, the Federals only succeeded in dis- mounting some guns, and killing five men and wound- ing ten. On the 23rd the news from the forts was encourag- ing, but on the morning of the 24th the Federal fleet steamed up the stream to the forts, and opened fire upon them and the gun-boats. Soon the strife became furious, and in one hour several of the attacking ships sailed past the forts. Owing to the night-signals being the same as those of the Confederates, the vessels were not discovered until abreast of the batteries. The conflict now became deadly, and the forts belched forth fire from all the guns that could be brought to bear; but it was too late to produce much impression, and the "Hartford," commanded by Comman- der Farragut, led the van, and the Federal fleet pushed   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE,      245 on through the storm of shot and shell. On the other hand, the Confederate fleet, which consisted of only seventeen vessels in all, eight of which only were armed, disputed with desperation the pass, and fought against overwhelming odds, until they were driven on shore. These vessels were scuttled or burned by their own commanders. The "Manasses" was run ashore and sunk, and the famous "Louisiana," the great iron-clad, could not be brought into action, as her machinery was not in good working order. Fifty-two killed and wounded, were the total loss of this contest; amongst the latter was Commander McIntosh, desperately wounded. In the fiercest of the strife, he and Commander Mitchell stood on the deck of the "Louisiana." Valiantly that little fleet withstood the attack, and towards the close of the action, and just as the "Doub- loon" appeared in view, the "Iroon" was about over- hauling her, when the "Governor Moore," commnded by Captain Beverley Kennon, darted upon the "Iroon," and  ran into her three times. The Federal vessel managed to escape, and was again about capturing the "A Governor Moore," when the "Quitman " ran into her amid-ship, and sunk her, thus allowing General Lovell to make his escape. But Captain Kennon, the last to yield, sped down the liver into the midst of the Mam- moth fleet--dashing hither and thither, attacking first one and then another of his monstrous antagonists. Being ordered repeatedly to haul down  his flag, which floated defiantly in the face of the foe, he would answer, "Come and take it down, if you can." "Haul down that flag," repeated the Federal com- mander.  &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC7351-00000125"/> 246   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; "Never!" replied Captain Kennon, as he answered with a volley of shot. Again came the command, "Haul down that flag, or I'll fire into you!" "Fire!" he added, with a strong objurgation, at the same time firing away his last round of ammu- nition, and, seeing that he would be captured, he sprang to thile bow of the vessel, and drawing his sword from the scabbard, broke it across his knee, exclaiming "I will never surrender this to a d--ned Yankee." Then, perceiving the Federals about to board the vessel, he drew his pistol, and aiming at one, fired, and the splash which followed the report, told of the precision of the aim. The wounded lay thick upon the deck of the "Gover- nor Moore," and though Captain Kknnon felt that he no longer possessed the means of fighting the foe, he determined not to yield, and seizing a torch, set fire to the vessel and then sprang into the river, hoping to swim to shore, but was captured after some resistance, being only slightly wounded. Refusing to take the oath of parole, he was sent on board the "Cayuga," which vessel bore him to Fort Warren, where he re- mained some three months, and then, being exchanged, arrived shortly afterwards in Richmond, and once more proffered his services to the Confederacy. He may well be styled the HERO OF FORT JACESON, and his valorous conduct -elicited compliment even from his enemies. The Northern journals teemed with accounts of his gallant behaviour, and articles headed "Honour to whom honour is due," "' Give the Devil his due," etc., were devoted to anecdotes of his chivalrous deeds.   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      247 When all the other vessels of the Confederate fleet had lowered their flags at the command of the invader, or by force, one alone remained floating defiant alike of threat or force, and when Captain Kennon was sent to Fort Warren, it was on the criminal charge of having kept the standard raised when the rest of the fleet had surrendered. The officers of the Federal navy recog- nised in this hero their friend of former days, and Captain Kennon did not sever the ties of sixteen years' companionship with many of those without regret. But a Virginian by birth, he sprang from a race of heroes, and his father will long be remembered as the gallant Commodore Kennon who was blown up on board the "Princeton " several years since. He left two sons, one the subject of this sketch, and the other, Captain Dan- bridge Kennon, who with his brave cousin, the gallant J. E. B. Stewart, fought and won laurels from the commencement of hostilities. Allied to the families of George Washington (through the Custis's), the Lee's, and Butler's, we are'not surprised at Captain Kennon's deeds of valour. The "Governor Moore" being the last antagonist, the Federals had nothing further to fear from the fleet, and slowly they passed on towards the city. The citizens of New Orleans, startled from their slumber of repose and by the tolling of the alarm bells, supposed that the foe had passed the forts, and were approaching the city. The entire city was thrown into a state of commotion, and the whole of its inhabi- tants rushed into the streets, each enquiring the meariing of the excitement, and when they were told ot their danger they could not believe it, until General Lovell arrived, at 2 P. M., from the forts. The river forts  &#xD;<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC7351-00000126"/> 248   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; had not fallen, but two of the enemy's gun-boats actually threatened the city and the works at Chalmette; five 32-pounders on one side of the river and nine on the other; still remained intact. The civil authorities of New Orleans entreated the Confederate commander to retire from the city, as it was feared a bombardment would be the result if he did not. General Lovell ordered his troops to Camp Moore, a distance of some seventy miles above New Orleans. Farragut made a formal demand for the surrender of the command, which General Lovell refused, and told the officers who bore the message that he would attack any troops that might land. General Lovell held an interview with Mayor Monroe and offered to hold the city as long as there was a man left. But this sacrifice of life was deemed unnecessary, as the few raw and poorly armed infantry could do nothing against the fleet, and the whole force then in the city amounted to only 2,800 men. Language can give no idea of the scene which followed the order for evacuation' Through an avenue of grief and woe indescribable, the Confederate soldiers passed on the way to the trains which were to bear them from their homes, and all they held dear. Slowly they passed on through the different streets, and hushed and awful was the tread of their feet, like their now muffled hopes. Stern was their look, and they scarce dared a glance of adieu to the fair who bade them "God speed " through their tears and sobs. No drums sounded, not a note was heard, but the beating of many hearts was in unison with the dirge-like sounds of mourning which were wafted on the winds of Heaven to the ear of the brave little band, who were forced to   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      249 see their beautiful city polluted by the footsteps of the invader. Lovely in their sorrow even, stood the women of New  Orleans, waving farewell to the heroes, and some in their desolation reminded one of the daughters of Zion hanging their harps on the willows by the waters of Babylon. Some stood calm as statues,'with clasped hands and tearless eyes, while others wept convulsively, and some again gazed upon the scene with heaving bosoms and kindling eyes. The latter were predominant, and by their manner convinced the parting fathers, husbands, sons, and brothers, that there was nought to fear for them, and that should a br'rtal soldiery take possession of their city, there yet remained a protection against the foe, viz., nerve to plant the steel deep in the heart of the dastard who should dare to outrage or oppress them.  Carriages, with the fairest and loveliest of the city, were rolling on towards the depot to bid a passionate farewell to departing friends, and when the train moved off with the mass of human freight, it was amidst tears, bless- ings, and sobs. But hope yet remained, and the citizens of New Orleans believed their city still secure, as forts Jackson and Phillip had not fallen.  Alas! on the morning of the next day the Federal fleet turned the point and came in sight of the city. The Confederate troops were still busy in the evacu- ation, and the streets were thronged with all descrip- tions of vehicles, laden with every article of warfare. Mounted officers were galloping to and fro, in a state of the greatest excitement, and the streets were crowded  l with persons, who were laden with provisions plundered  &#xD;<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC7351-00000127"/> 250   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; from the public stores, while others, more patriotic, were busy in destroying property which would prove of value to the enemy, and huge loads of cotton were seen rumbling along on the way to the levee. When the Federal flbet made its appearance, it was amidst the smoke of burning cotton, and the stifling odour of the sugar and bacon consigned to the flames. Vast columns of flame rose in the air, and vied with the sunlight, and sublimely grand became the scene, when the torch was set to the steam-boats, ships, and gun- boats -which were in the river, and: they were sent floating down the stream into the midst of the enemy's fleet, threatening destruction to it. In the sacrifice was included the celebrated iron-clad frigate the "Mississippi," which was accounted the most important naval structure the Confederate Government hadyet undertaken. Fifteen thousand bales were consumed, the value of which was estimated at a million and a-half of dollars. The specie of the banks, to the amount of twelve or fifteen millions, was removed from the city, and placed in concealment as well as all the stores and moveable property of the Confederate States. Thus when the Federal Comman- der took possession of the city, a few days afterwards, it was to find it deserted, and in place of the royal monarch "King Cotton," whom he had expected to grace his triumphal entrance, he found. only the smoking funeral pyre of this Sardanapolis. Throughout the city deeds of heroism were being enacted, and in Carrollton the cannon were spiked by Mrs. Brown and her maid, while the delicate hands of the former were swollen and bleeding from her patriotic effort to prevent the guns being of use to the enemy.

Beautiful and delicate, you would scarcely suppose her possessed of such nerve--to gaze upon her when her beautiful dreamy eyes were in repose. Her husband had left with his command, and she remained to do what she could for the cause of her country. The city was now under the jurisdiction of Mayor Monroe, and nobly, gallantly, did he perform his part in this trying hour. To the demand from Flag Officer Farragut to the Mayor, that all the flags should be hauled down that were flying from the various public buildings in the city, the latter replied, that the citizens of New Orleans yielded to physical force alone, and that they maintained their allegiance to the Confederate States. On the 26th of April, however, a force landed from the sloop-of-war "Peuslacola" lying  opposite Esplanade Street, and hoisted a United States flag upon the Mint. The excitement was intense, and this was the moment in which an act was done, that in a few days after added one more martyr to the list of Confederates. In that crowd stood one in whose eyes flashed indignant fire, and with whom to think was to act, when, mount- ing to the dome, he tore the emblem of oppression from the staff, and descending with it, he was joined by others, who trailed it through the dust of the streets, until it was soiled and in rags. Flag Offcer Farragut, exasperatedbeyond all bounds, determined to spare no mortification to a city, whose only protection was now in its civil officers. The State flag still floated from the City Hall, an emblem of State sovereignty, nothing more, yet it was required that this should be lowered by the citizens.  &#xD;<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC7351-00000128"/> 252   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; Again the fair and lovely women of New Orleans proved their claims to an immortal wreath of glory, when the proudest and wealthiest of them signed a memorial, praying the Common Council to protect at least the emblem of their State sovereignty from insult. The copy of the memorial I place before you:- "This petition was drawn up and signed by some fifty to sixty names before it was known that the Mayor and Council had decided upon their reply to Captain Farragut's ultimatum: "To the Honourable the Mayor and Common Council of the city of New Orleans:- "The petition of the wives, the daughters, the mothers and the sisters of your constituents:- "Understanding that Flag-Officer Farragut, com- manding the naval squadron now threatening the city, has given notice to the authorities to haul down the Louisiana State flag from the City Hall, and to make a formal act of surrender of the city of New Orleans, with the alternative of removing the women and children within forty-eight hours, we do pray your Honour and your honourable body to refuse to surrender the city, or to haul down the flag, which is the emblem of the sovereignty of Louisiana, promising you our counte- nance and support."

"Gentlemen of the Common Council, "I herewith transmit to you a communication from Flag-Officer Farragut, commanding the United States' fleet now lying in front of this city. I have informed the officer bearing the communication that I would lay   it before you, and return such answer as the city authorities might deem. proper to be made. "In the meantime, permit me to suggest that Flag- Officer Farragut appears to have misunderstood the City of New Orleans. He has been distinctly informed that, at this moment, the city has no power to impede the exercise of such acts of forcible authority as the Commander of the United States' naval forces may choose to exercise; and that, therefore, no resistance could be offered to the occupation of the city by the United States' forces. If it is deemed necessary to remove the flag now floating from this building, or to raise United States' flags on others, the power which threatens the destruction of our city is certainly capable of performing those acts. New Orleans is not now a military post; there is no military commander within its limits; it is like an unoccupied fortress, of which an assailant may at any moment take possession. But I do not believe that the constituency repre- sented by you or by me embraces one loyal citizen who would be willing to incur the odium of tearing down the symbol representing the State authority to which New Orleans owes her municipal existence. I am deeply sensible of the distress which would be brought upon our community by a consummation of the inhuman threats of the United States' commander; but I cannot conceive that those who so recently declared themselves to be animated by a Christian spirit, and by a regard for the rights of private pro- perty, would venture to incur for themselves and the government they represent, the universal execration of the civilized world, by attempting to achieve, through a   &#xD;<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC7351-00000130"/> 256   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; wanton destruction of life and property, that which they can accomplish without bloodshed, and without a resort to those hostile measures which the law of nations condemns and execrates, when employed upon the defenceless women and children of an unresisting city.

"Gentlemen,-The Forts St. Phillip and Jackson having surrendered, and all the military defences of the   city being either capitulated or abandoned, you are re- quired, as the sole representative of any supposed autho- rity in the city, to haul down and suppress every ensign and symbol of government, whether State or Confederate, except that of the United States. I am now about to raise the flag of the United States upon the Custom House, and you will see that it is respected with all the civil power of the city. "I have the honour to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant, "D. G. FARRAGUT, ' Flag-Officer, Western Gulf, Blockading Squadron." Correspondence between the Mayor and Captain Farragut:- The following letters conclude the correspondence which has been going on for several days between the U S. Flag-Officer and the Mayor of this city. It will be seen from the letter of Captain Farragut that he seeks to vindicate himself from the conclu- sion that he intended to threaten the city in a certain event. We would further add, in justification of the construction placed by the Mayor and the people, and we may say of the foreign Consuls, on Flag-Officer Far- ragut's letter, that when Commander Bell delivered the last letter to the Mayor the following conversation oc- curred:- Mayor Monroe-"As I consider this a threat to bom- bard the city, and as it is a matter about which the notice- should be clear and specific, I desire to know when the forty-eight hours began to run?" s 2   &#xD;<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC7351-00000132"/> 260   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; Commander Bell--"It begins from the time you receive this notice." The Mayor then drew his watch, and showing it to Commander Bell, said, "Then you see it is fifteen minutes past twelve o'clock." The Commander recognised the correctness of .the time, and made some remarks, which were understood by all present to convey distinctly the threat, that if the flag was not hauled down in forty-eight hours, the city would be shelled. The letters below were laid before the Council by the Mayor, but the Council did not see any necessity for any action on them:- ,' Mayoralty of New Orleans, "City Hall, May 1st, 1862. ( To the Common Council in Joint Session. "Gentlemen, -I herewith lay before you a copy of a communication received yesterday from Flag-Officer Farragut. You will observe that the note intimates a misinterpretation on the part of the city authorities of Flag-Officer Farragut's previous communication. I ven- ture ,to say, gentlemen, that no reasoning mind can fail to place on the note of Monday, the 28th instant, the interpretation attached to it by the people of this city. The notification to remove our women and children within forty-eight hours, in case we adhered to our reso- lution not to haul down our flag, can be construed in no other way than as a threat to bombard the city. The meaning was plain, not only to us, but to the Consuls of the foreign nations residing here. But in so clear a case argument is superfluous.   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      261 "Flag-Officer Farragut informs us that, in conse- quence of the offensive nature of our answer to his threat, he declines further communication with us, and; shall, on the arrival of General Butler, hand the city over to his charge. He certainly should be conscious that the city of New Orleans sought no communication with him or his forces, and that the cessation of inter- course, while it depended entirely on his will, could not fail to be quite as agreeable to us as to him. "It would add still further to our gratification should General Butler find it equally unpleasant to hold com- m nication with the city. "Respectfully, (Signed)  "JOHN T. MONROE, Mayor." 2 "' U. S.

"Very respectfully, your obedient servant, " (Signed)  D. G. FARRAGUT. "Flag-Officer, Western Gulf, Blockading Squadron." Thus he forced the insolent foe to perform this act of insult, and reluctantly Flag-Officer Farragut con- sented to send his own forces to take down the flag. At noon appeared a force of about two hundred armed marines, and a number of sailors, dragging two brass howitzers, and the officer in command mounting to the dome of the building, removed the flag of the State, in sight of an immense crowd, who stood viewing this act with a solemn and sad regard. The stillness was awful of that vast assembly, and the tears bedewed the cheeks of stern men, as well as fair maidens. The scene of humiliation was over, and as the crowd dispersed for their homes, the silent grasp of the hand spoke volumes, and told of the agony of heart with which they left the spot. An incident of the time is well deserving of record. A prominent citizen-one of the city fathers-passing the residence of one of our most patriotic and warm- hearted women, not a thousand miles from the City Hall, and seeing the ladies of the house on the front steps, saluted them, and entered into conversation respecting the events of the hour. He remarked upon the demand of Commodore Farragut to haul down our flag from the City Hall, and said that if even the Mayor and Council   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      263 came to the determination to yield, there was no man to be found willing to perform the humiliating and craven act. He then, by way of banter, said to one of the ladies:- "Won't you relieve us from the difficulty, and go up to the roof and take the flag down?" To which she replied, "Yes, I will go up, but will take a hammer with me, and nail t/he flag to the flag- sta ." We wish it were possible to transfer to .paper the spirit and manner of the utterance of this noble and fearless woman. The expression of her feelings was worthy of her-worthy of the cause; and a fit represen- tation of the sentiment which animated both sexes. In this moment of excitement, the most shameful and outrageous scandals were being circulated, and with- out grounds or satisfactory evidence. Generals Lovell and Duncan, though they had done all that men could do to defend forts Jackson and St. Phillip, were by the ignorant, rash, and inconsiderate, pronounced "traitors." General Lovell acted upon the advice of the Mayor and City Council, and General Duncan only surrendered when the soldiers threatened to fire upon their own officers, and spiked their guns. He had no other resource than to haul down his flag, and when on his return he made his address to the citizens of New Orleans, he wept like a child. But even for the poor worn out, weary soldiers there is some excuse for this conduct, as they had been exposed for many days to the furious and terrible fire of the bombardment, having been in water to their waists during the whole time. One com; pany, however, refused to join the rest of the garrison  &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC7351-00000134"/> IE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; in this act of mutiny, and in letters of gold let their names shine for ever, the "ST. MARY'S CANNONIERS." The Mayor thanked General Duncan, in the name of the citizens, for his gallant conduct, and the Hon. Pierre Soule was called upon to express to General Duncan the sentiments of the people, and that he would be held in everlasting remembrance for his gallant conduct. This scene was void of formality, and had no display or useless parade. In the hearts of all honest individuals Generals Lovell and Duncan were awarded their proper praise and merited admiration. An article appearing about this time, General Lovell presumed it referred to him, and accordingly responded. Both are worthy of perusal, and I place them before you. "FATLTIEN BUT NOT DISGRACED. "Let us not be humiliated. New Orleans has borne herself in this great struggle as became the renown of her people. She has fought, singly and alone, with her own resources, and those of a small State, with less than half a million of population, the naval and military power of a great nation of twenty millions of people, and with vast military resources. She has kept that hostile nation at bay for more than twelve months. She has only yielded now to an overwhelming power. Her only protection, the forts below the city, have held out for ten days against a hostile squadron, carrying over three hundred guns, including mortars of unusual calibre, and against a land and naval force of many thousands. It was only when the small garrisons of these forts were worn out and exhausted by the constant toil and   sleeplessness of an uninterrupted bombardment of ten days that they succumbed. When the United States' squadron succeeded stealthily in passing the forts, they were met by a small and weak squadron of gunboats, which grappled their huge -ships, and fought until they were sunk or blown up. The success of the hostile squadron in passing the forts left the city at their mercy. The surface of the Mississippi, now at its highest stage, gave their four large frigates, carrying over one hundred large guns, and their ten smaller ships, bearing as many more, complete range of our streets and houses. It was folly long to resist such a power. Our troops had left the city. There only remained the foreign brigades, th6 non-combatants, the women and children. ,The demeanour of these was noble and heroic beyond all example. When on a point of etiquette to them, but a point of honour to us, the city was menaced with a bombard- ment, there was no panic, no hesitation, no fear. Awful as the consequences would have been in such a city, withnoplace to retreat save the swamps, already sub- merged, the people cheerfully awaited the fate with which they were threatened.  If the men had dared to yield the point of honour, the women would have scourged them from the city; but there was no yielding. The civil authorities were worthy of the people. No flag was lowered by them, none hoisted but that which the enemy alone could by his physical force raise. The in vader met no friend, no ally, no sympathizer among us; the people presented their breasts to his guns and bayo- nets, in a solid phalanx. Thus far, we can honestly say that, except in the  &#xD;<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC7351-00000135"/> 3 HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; inconsistent, unauthorised, and cruel demand of the commanding officer of the fleet relative to the State flag, and, in the event of refusal, the menace to bombard the city, the enemy has borne himself with dignity and propriety. The terms yielded to the gallant gar- rison of our forts were honourable. The officers retired on their parole with their side-arms. The highest tributes were paid by the enemy to the heroism of the defence. The United States' flag waves over the city. It is the flag of the conqueror. Its presence has made doubly dear the standard which it has displaced. That will be embalmed in the hearts and memories of this people. This sad fate has come upon our city from no fault of our people and authorities. Louisiana was left alone to defend this great city. The forts were prepared, armed and defended exclusively by the troops of this State; the river by hastily constructed gunboats, manned by our own volunteers. The Government at Richmond gave us little aid, and, indeed, embarrassed us by the aid which it attempted to give. The defences would have been stronger and more formidable if a Con- federate naval officer had never had command in our river. The lack of energy and earnestness on the part of the agents of the Confederate Government deprived us of the most powerful of our resources for defence. Indeed, had not our resources been drained for the defences of other and far less important portions of the Confederacy, Louisiana would have had ample means for the maintenance of her own integrity; but we had already nearly exhausted our military resources to pro- tect distant sections of our Confederacy. There is another source of consolation to us. All   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.   the great cities of the world have been subjected to the humiliation which we are now passing through. Paris, Vienna, Moscow, London, Madrid, Antwerp, and all the great capitals of Europe, have in their turn been occu- pied by hostile armies. So, too, in our own country, Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Washington, Charles- ton, and Savannah, have had to succumb to invaders. There is no disgrace or dishonour in this. The only dis- grace and dishonour that can come to us will be when we surrender the convictions of our minds, the loyalty of our hearts, and the duties of our conscience. The physical victory has been won by the invader; it is for us to see that the moral victory is ours. GENERAL LOVELL. We publish below a letter from General Lovell, which presents a clear and satisfactory vindication of his course in the defence of this city. The statements of General Lovell, we believe, are fully sustained by the facts. In vindication of ourselves for the allusion to which the General takes exception, we beg to say that he never was in the contemplation of the writer in reference to lack of energy and earnestness on the part of the agents of the Confederate Government. We believe, on the contrary, that General Lovell, so far from being obnoxious to the charge of a lack of earnest- ness and energy, accomplished with the resources placed at his command, results of a character which have excited general surprise and admiration. There were other parties who were in our view in the allusion to' which the General takes exception, who did not prove equal to the occasion.  &#xD;<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC7351-00000136"/> E HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY;  We would further add, that in the several allusions to the evacuation of the city by General Lovell, we do not think it was intended by any sober-thinking person to convey any censure or any doubt as to the propriety of General Lovell's conduct in withdrawing his troops from the city after the fortifications had been forced by the enemy. Left with only an infantry force, General Lovell remained in the city after the enemy's fleet had anchored in its port. He was willing and ready to share the fate of the city; but it was evident that he was not only impotent for defence, but the enemy, with his command of the river, would have had it in his power to reduce the city to starvation, by cutting off all communication with the interior. Besides, the continu- ation of the troops in the city would have exposed it to a bombardment, in which the enemy would have been justified by the laws of war, a garrisoned town being always subject to such a fate. If General Lovell had had five or ten times the infantry force which he really had, he could not have made any adequate defence against the enemy's powerful fleet. His retirement was, therefore, not only an act of sound policy and wisdom, but one of absolute necessity for the salvation of the city from the most terrible disaster, as well as for the security of the army, which General Lovell has saved to lead to other fields, where their valour may be made available for the maintenance and defence of our cause. "New Orleans, April 29th, 1862. "To Judge Walker. "Dear Sir.-In the 'Evening Delta,' in an article headed 'Fallen but not Disgraced,' this expression   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.    269   occurs:-' The lack of energy and earnestness on the part of the agents of the Confederate Government,' &amp;c. "This includes me in its sweep, and I think un- justly. When I came here, but a few short months since, I found the State completely defenceless; its ports blockaded, and its young men gone to other parts of the Confederacy in the army. Without anything but what was created, every inlet was put in a position to offer a protracted and gallant defence. Forts were armed, powder and munitions of every description were made, and a gallant body of troops organized and drilled. Guns were cast and materials of all kinds extemporized by incessant labour and activity. The river, at the forts, was twice bridged by obstructions which would have resisted anything but the formidable rush of the great Mississippi in its swollen wrath. "My troops, at the call of their country, rushed to Corinth, and the deeds of the Lovisiana regiments on the 6th and 7th of April, indicated their courage and their training. Our founderies were beginning to turn out heavy guns of the best quality; and a newly- erected arsenal furnished us with various implements of war. All this has been done since October, besides pre- paring sixteen vessels for river defence, eight of which are now defending the upper river, and eight have been destroyed in the vain attempt to keep back the enemy's fleet of war vessels below. This has been done with no host of generals and staff-officers of experience to assist. Almost alone, with but few exceptions, I have worked day and night for more than five months to defend this great city. The responsibility of its fall is not due to any want of 'energy or earnestness' on my part.  &#xD;<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC7351-00000137"/> [E HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; In a short time more I should have had guns enough, and men enough, to defend the numerous approaches on that element on which the enemy is so pre-eminently powerful; and I, therefore, beg that you will do me the justice to say to the people of New Orleans, that I did all that one man'could do to preserve them from an insolent and powerful foe. "When their fleets passed all our batteries, I with- drew my infantry forces beyond the city limits, in order to permit the people of New Orleans to decide whether they would subject their wives, their children, and property to bombardment in the endeavour to maintain their freedom intact; and returned to the city to-day to learn their decision, and to offer myself and my command to stand by them to the last moment, in case they should decide to undergo a bombardment.  I know that there are many gentlemen here who will bear me witness that all that is here set forth, and much more, has been done to avert this sad disaster. An examination of my letter and order books and telegraphic despatches, will show that no stone has been left unturned by me to save New Orleans from this humiliation; and I feel well convinced that a few short weeks would have rendered the position impreg- nable. All I ask is simple justice, and nothing more. In conclusion I will add, that terrible as the blow has been, I am neither disheartened nor in despair. This war of independence is not yet fought out.  Our ancestors struggled on against the massive power of Great Britain, when Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Charleston, and Savannah were all in possession of the enemy, and gained their liberty.   "It is a moral and physical impossibility that we can be conquered. Let us but be true to ourselves and our cause-never tiring, never despairing-but rising, Actaeon-like, with renewed vigour from every fall, and we shall yet be rewarded with success. Above all, we should not crush down the spirit and the energies of those who are using all the faculties, mental and physical, that God has given them, by making light of their labours, because, with limited means and under adverse circumstances, they have not been successful in resisting at all points a great, wealthy, and powerfui enemy, with all the appliances of modern warfare, both military and naval, in great abundance at his control. We have never yet seen such dark days as those which environed George Washington at Valley Forge; and should such be our lot, I trust that the same spirit will animate us to work out the same successful results. "Respectfully your obedient servant, "M. LOVELL, "Major-General, C S.A." Could such sentiments exist in the heart of a traitor? I answer, No! The brigade of foreign residents, under command of General Paul Juge, deserve lasting gratitude for the efficiency displayed in maintaining peace and order in the city, during the confusion and trouble incident to the appearance of the United States' fleet in the port. And now little remains to be said. The city was taken possession of by General B. F. Butler, and as his troops marched into the city, they found how great was the mistake that Union sentiments existed in New Orleans, &#xD;<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC7351-00000138"/> 272   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; and well they know that Union feelings could not be masked by the darkened visages which met their gaze at every step, and the fearful scowls, and muttered curses of the few men who gathered around to witness their entrance, left them no hope for establishing, on anything like a firm basis, Federal government in Louisiana. General Butler established himself at the St. Charles Hotel, which, on the arrival of the Federals, was by the Southerners vacated, and the Yankees were thus left to occupy it. General Butler, as well as several officers of the Federal army, were accompanied by their wives, but unfortunately for those ladies they were regarded in quite a different light by the citizens of New Orleans, and thus subjected to the most cruel suspicions; the commanding general's own wife was regarded as a courtezan, and in a few days after her arrival, was called upon by two women of infamous character, who represented themselves as the wives of Confederate officers. A longer stay, and greater knowledge of the Southern women, proved to General Butler and his staff, that none save a courtezan, and one of the most reckless character, would have dared to countenance or recognize them or their wives. They were thus forced to seek society amongst their kind; and the Southern man or woman base enough to stretch forth the hand of recognition to them, was stamped with the brand of infamy, and their names remembered for that day in which the traitor shall be judged. No kind glance, no word of welcome met the eye, or fell upon the ear, and the lone sentinel paced the streets of the silent and fallen city, with a vision ever   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      273 before his eyes of a gleaming stiletto, and muffled form, for they knew not at what moment they might fall victims to the suppressed, but burning hatred of the citizens. Tremblingly the pickets marched to their duty on the outskirts of the city, as with blanched cheeks they each day heard of the guerilla bands and their daring deeds. Within the city military rule was now established, and soon "The Reign of Terror" was inaugurated, which has given to future ages even more material than its sister period in France. General Butler won 'the title of Robespierre, and many other tender soubriquets, which will appear in their proper places. Officers and men paraded the streets daily, investi- gating matters, to them of great importance, and houses were searched throughout for Confederate arms, flags, tents, clothing, and money. A party for the above purpose landed from one of the enemy's ships above Carrollton, and proceeding to the abandoned fortifica- tions -inspected them, and tore up a small Confederate flag which they found flying over the works. Returning down the Levee, the officers met a family of ladies and children, accompanied by their coloured servant. The Federals, addressing themselves first to the ladies, expressed a hope that the presence of the fleet was not a cause of fear to them. We will relate, verbatim, the conversation that ensued:- Mrs. B.: "That sensation, Sir, is unknown to us here." Officer: "Madame, may I ask you if there is any Union sentiment here?" Mrs. B.: "None, Sir, that I am aware of; certainly none among the ladies." T  &#xD;<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC7351-00000139"/> 274   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; Officer: "Then -we may take it for granted that there is none among either sex, as the ladies generally go with the gentlemen in political questions?" Mrs. B.: "I am confident, Sir, your inference as to the entire absence of any Union sentiments is correct. As to the ladies following the gentlemen in political questions, I beg you to understand that, however it may be in your section, the ladies here advocate that only which is just and honourable." Officer: (Turning his attention to one of the ser- vants) "Well, Sis, can you tell me if all the troops have left yet?" Nancy being for a moment quiet, the lady said: "Nancy, why don't you answer your brother?" Nancy: (With great indignation) "Don't you call me Sis again. I don't want no Yankee for a bruder." The whole Federal party passed on without another word. This was the reception they met with on every side, and Mrs. Brown proved herself as spirited in her converse with the foe, as she did when spiking the guns. Then long live such women, and may the foe, when he comes in his insolent pride, ever meet with the scorn of all true women. We will now close the veil upon this scene, and introduce you, reader, to spectacles of interest which will never fade from memory, though they be lost to vision.   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.        275 CHAPTER XVII. "Our earth as it rolls through the regions of space, Wears always two faces, the dark side and sunny; And poor human life runs the same sort of race, Being sad, on one side,-on the other side funny. "For our parts, though gravity's good for the soul, Such a fancy have we for the side that there's fun on, We'd rather, with Sydney, south-west take a ' stroll,' Than coac h it north-east with his Lordship of Lunnun."

THE fall of New   Orleans, though a  most dreadful blow to the Confederacy, in no    manner decided the fate of the war, and the victories of the brave troops in the battles around Richmond gave them  renewed hopes for the future.  The Confederates needed  something  to %waken them  from  the lethargy into which they had allen, through their long and almost constant success.

' The Drill of the Lapstone Rangers.-This body of citizen soldiery, composed of the best blood of the   j land, has grown into a regiment, and has so organised  E in advance to meet the requirements of the new law which goes into effect on the 15th, that Colonel Sole, commanding the regiment, assures us that the regi- ment embraces in its ranks none but gentlemen; and Colonel Sole being a reliable gentleman himself, we repose the greatest confidence in his statement. He has presented us with a revised copy of Hardee, de- signed for the exclusive government of the Lapstone Rangers, which certainly goes to show that the regi- mental orders, the drill exercises, and the manual   * generally, were gotten up expressly for the government of gentlemen. Colonel Sole always publishes the order for battalion drill on the second page of a morning paper-headed notice--and in the following courteous style:- ," Gentlemen of the Lapstone Rangers, "If in perfect accordance with the economy of your digestive code, I have the honour to invite you to ride down town to your respective armouries, as soon after dinner as you may deem it prudent, to-morrow, to par- ticipate in a portion of the exercises incident to battalion   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      2" drill.

Supposing, of course, the invitation harmonises with "digestive code," the different companies composing the regiment of Lapstone Rangers appear, according to card, upon the field used for drill, Colonel Sole, after saluting the vast number of ladies who are gathered on the field, and replacing his white handkerchief, turns to the regiment, draws his sword, and opens- "Gentlemen,-If any gentleman in the battalion has in his mouth a cigar that is not quite smoked, I have the honour to inform him that the hour has arrived when he can throw it away with impunity, if he chooses to do so." Upon this courteously delivered piece of military information, sundry gentlemen proceed to suck sundry cigar stumps, preparatory to the whiff that will consign these stumps to the usual position of " old sojors." Whereupon Colonel Sole draws his sword, lifts off his hat, throws his eyes to the left, then to the right, wreathes his military lips into a bland smile, and says, "Gentlemen of the Battalion -I desire to state, to insinuate, with due sense of the courteous relations existing between the members of this regiment and your humble Colonel, that if perfectly agreeable to you, you will place yourselves in the attitude of attention."  &#xD;<pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC7351-00000141"/> 278   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; The gentlemen thus courteously appealed to, of course respond, with the exception of one or two of the men who are deeply absorbed in an argument with their Captain and 1st Lieutenant upon the most improved method of tanning hides without the use of bark. They too, however, take their proper position in line, and the Colonel, after acknowledging the fact, proceeds- "Gentlemen,-You will do me the favour to shoulder arms-if you please." The arms are duly shouldered in gentlemanly style. The Colonel now goes on- "Gentlemen,-Alexander wept for a second world to conquer, Solomon sighed for the wings of a dove, but neither of them, could they have realised their desires, would have been happier than your Colonel would be if you, by the right of companies, would change your position to the rear into column. In order to accomplish this very important manoeuvre, gentlemen, I will beg that each company will face to the right. Now do me the kindness to march?" The request is complied with to the extreme satis- faction of the Colonel and the delight of the ladies. The applause of the latter is gracefully acknowledged by Colonel Sole, who gallops away to the right of the line, and then gallops back again. After satisfying himself that the line is dressed to suit those in it, he continues- "Gentlemen,-It would probably be more to your con- venience and ease-and I assure you it would meet with the entire approbation of your Colonel--were you to come to an ' order arms.'" Of course, the regiment comes to an " order arms." Whereupon Colonel Sole says:-   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      279 "Gentlemen,-Your Colonel, ever mindful of the fact that the human frame, after the performance of arduous duties, should indulge in reasonable repose, you are invited to assume the position usually assumed by soldiers when the order is given to 'rest.' It now devolves upon Major Strap to see that every gentleman in the ranks who is suffering from fatigue is supplied with refreshments." A reasonable time having elapsed for rest, the Colonel respectfully insinuates, in an extremely delicate manner, that the gentlemen should resume the attitude of a corps : inl attention. The Colonel then states:- "Gentlemen,-You would place me under lasting bbligations if you would kindly consent to shoulder arms." The regiment courteously complied. "Gentlemen,-Would you pow honour your Colonel and please the ladies by showing them the perfect regu- larity with which you can support arms." The regiment kindly honoured the Colonel and pleased the ladies by executing the order. Colonel Sole, highly   delighted, put his white handkerchief into his pocket, and relieved himself thus: "Gentlemen,--There is one more manoeuvre which I desire executed, provided it meets with your approval. Gentlemen,-If you are not too much fatigued (I will not ask you to shoulder arms), gladden the heart of your commanding officer and yield to the request he will now make of you. Gentlemen,-I beg that you will now form a column upon the company wipch has the deserved honour of being the first--that is, if the  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC7351-00000142"/> E HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; front had not been changed-and I hope the gentlemen who command the different companies will hire people to see that wheeling distance is observed." This is a movement which belongs especially to the regiment of Lapstone Rangers, and is executed in superior style. Whereupon Colonel Sole, in the pride of his heart and the full satisfaction of the afternoon's performance, addresses the regiment: "Gentlemen,--The country is safe. I have the honour to congratulate you, gentlemen, upon the punc- tuality of your attendance, the precision of your move- ments, and the military bearing which every gentleman exhibits. Gentlemen, you will now take the first street you come to without the formality of forming into line and sending the commissioned gentlemen to the front and centre. Gentlemen,-If you should find it incon- venient to take the first street you come to, please take any street or streets convenient to you. And you would consult your own interests and futurewelfare if youwould select those thoroughfares in which the mud is less than two feet deep. Gentlemen,-Hoping to meet you again upon the occasion of our next drill, I have the honour to wish you a very good evening." The Lapstone Rangers, it is almost unnecessary to state, form the very upper leather of society. Awl the chivalry of the parish, not connected with other regi- ments, may be found in its ranks; and should they wax wroth, and have to foot it to the borders of the land, the bristles will be taken from some of the Yanks sure. Colonel Sole assures us that the Feds may hammer other portions of our reserve corps, but when they come to the regiment of Lapstone Rangers, the latter will   welt them till they are thinned out like shoe thread, and are compelled to peg out at last. This likeness bears a strong resemblance to those who filled the volunteer ranks in New Orleans, and their sybarite customs could not be laid aside until the stern experience of camp life made them feel that to the patriot Lacedemonian fare and the "black broth" of Sparta is sufficient luxury. The above picture was not overdrawn, and though it only referred to the working men of Southern cities, who, not like the opulent planter, in whom this indolence was by nature, became inoculated with this truly tropical spirit. But this scene was too bright to be lasting, and it wanted some shadow to relieve the dazzling hues, whose glow and voluptuous richness were but the true harbinger of storm and devas- tation. We were not sorry thus to see the sinews of the South strung to the war-pitch, as much was to be dreaded from the national languor which the last blow felled by the Federals dissipated for ever. The spirit which actuated the South was not that of fanaticism, which in its mad orgies kindles the torch of intolerance, and in its insane fury threatens destruction to all, save those who join in its diabolical rites. The fanaticism of the North has plotted the death of the Goddess of Liberty, and though she still struggles to shun the fate which the world knows awaits her, Fanaticism has pro- nounced her sentence, and she must die. Then let the South take warning, and give no encou- ragement to the stranger-let them extend no welcome, and let their hearts close upon this demon, whose kiss is poison, whose embrace is deadly, whose triumph would   &#xD;<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC7351-00000143"/> 282   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; banish God from creation, and convert creation into chaos. It plotted the massacre of St. Bartholomew, and organised the Reign of Terror. It set up the Inquisition in Spain, and in France worshipped Reason in the form   of a courtesan, and chose a madman for its priest, a fitting representative of its hellish ceremonies. It was Abo- lition fanaticism, which appeared sans toilette, and in its most hideous deformity in its last character before the world, which elicited the compliment, "Nothing civilizes them" from the London "Times," and pronounces the Northern people "neither amenable to courtesy nor misfortune" and now to quote a criticism on this remark, I will beg, dear reader, your kind attention :- "The barbarism of the North, Nothing civilizes them." It is held by some writers on the philosophy of history, that civilisation is not the result of gradual development, but is an essential condition-that it is not an incident to progress, but an inherent principle; that it cannot be superadded where it is not already an indwelling quality, appertaining to the thoughts and sentiments, and manifesting itself in the manners and institutions of a people. History has proved, as far as history can prove anything, the utter incapacity of certain races to acquire a genuine and intrinsic civilisation. No amount of white-washing can place the African on the same social platform with the civilised European. No tempta- tions of commerce, of comfort, of security, can localise the nomadic Arabs and Tartars. No laws, no treaties, no threats, no promises, can overcome the ferine propen- sities of the North American aborigine. We have had   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      283 good historical grounds for regarding these races as uncivilised and uncivilisable. But what are we to say to the bold assertion of the 'London "Times," that the Yankee race belongs to the same category? Will the glorious land of universal Sham consent to see its claims to superior civilisation thus contumeliously spurned? Will the famous authors of liqueous nutmegs, and 'the similitudes of hams that are perfectly innocent of pork, peaceably bear to have those eminent tokens of march of mind and culmination of art insultingly overlooked by the leading organ of English opinion? We pause breathless for an answer. Meantime let us note more particularly the proposition of the London '"Times." That journal (as may be seen in its article pub- lished in another column), while speaking of the battle of Manasses--of the vulgar bravado of the Lincoln press that preceded it, the rout and disaster that attended it; the monstrous mendacity and brutal sentiments of the same press, that followed it--remarks that, judged by these and like indications, the Northern people " are amenable neither to courtesy nor misfortune. Nothing civilises them." Strange, indeed, must such language sound .to an English public, which had been so long schooled in the belief that if there was any civilisation in the States lying between the St. Lawrence and the Rio Grande, the true and only well assured seat of it -existed in what was known as the Northern section. All the rest--Seward and Sumner, Beecher and Stowe Cheever and Helper had told them, and their press, with small exception, with indolent complacency, had parroted the canting accusation--was blighted with the " black  &#xD;<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC7351-00000144"/> 284   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; curse of slavery." The text of the last and longest of Sumner's senatorial philippics was "The barbarism of slavery." The South, he maintained, was maculate with all manner of vice and crime, and barbaric to the core by reason of slavery, and it was the rightful and bounden mission of the North, immaculate, saintly, and pre-eminently enlightened and progressive, to broad- cast the seeds of genuine civilisation to the moral wilderness of the slaveholding States. Now, what is Mr. Sumner to think?  What are his constituency at Boston, that "hub of creation," that "Athens of America," to think? What are the great war party of the North to think? What are the pen-and-ink warriors of the Northern war press to think? What is the whole Abolition and Lincoln capoodle of them to think, when told by the principal journalistic representative of the English public, whose sympathies they have so assiduously courted, and so confidently counted on, that, taken upon evidence of their own making, upon their avowed acts and public professions, they are uncivilised, and incapable of civilisation? The language of the London "Times," to which we refer, is doubtless to be construed, with some allowance for an exaggeration of bitter sarcasm. But the words contain a cruel sting, which no qualification of that kind can remove. It is the sting of truth-of truth as inexorable as death, as remorseless as the grave. Allowing for all excess of badinage, for all extravagance of ridicule, the general accusation against our vaunting enemies at the North remains, that in their arrogation of superior civilisation, in their assumption of moral and intellectual supremacy over their Southern neighbours, they were practising a   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      285 stupendous cleat upon the world, and that now, when war, with its vicissitudes and excitements, reveals them in the nakedness of their nature, in all the coarseness of their bad propensities, they are found to be " amenable neither to courtesy nor misfortune," that, in .fact, "nothing civilises them." Even so. The Abolition fanaticism of the North is only another name for bar- barism. Slavery is an occasion, not the cause of its manifestation. The Union is the symbol of cohesion employed by the leaders of barbarous hosts thirsting for rapine and slaughter, not the intelligible object of the war which is waged upon the South. If there were no cry of slavery, no cry of Union, there would have been some other cry, which would have meant- the same thing. Substantially the same issue would have been forced upon us under any disposition of events. It is a proverbial impossibility to manufacture a "silk purse out of a sow's ear." With the "Times," so we exclaim, "Nothing civilises them," and not till New Orleans fell did these savages prove their claim to ancestry with the Aborigines--and full scope was now given by their chief B. F. B. (which being translated means brute, fiend, butcher), whose acts of brutality, military domination, and insult, causing the universal poverty and beggary of millions, and the triumph of the vilest individuals in the community, and abasement of the honest and industrious, together with the outlawry of slaves (with whom on his arrival in New Orleans he professed to have no sympathy) the destruction in this region of agriculture and commerce, and the emigration of some of the wealthiest and most thriving citizens. But the soldiers of the Confederacy left for other  &#xD;<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC7351-00000145"/> 286   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; fields, where they could meet the foe on equal terms, and none remained save those who had families depen- dent on them, and were incapable of efficient military duty. But those who remained proved themselves as patriotic perhaps as those upon the field, in their noble resistance to the Federal authority. On the arrival of the Federals, every one who could conveniently leave the city did so at once, and amongst the number Judge de Breuil, leaving his sister and Miss de Villerie to follow at leisure. As the fleet came slowly up the river, passing "Rosale Plantation," one of the sentinels on board the "Pensicola " remarked, "Is not that a Confederate flag which I see floating from the turret of yonder man- sion?" "By heavens, it is!" exclaimed one and all. "And methinks a lady is standing with her arms around the staff." "Fire a volley at it," remarked the commander, "and blow the woman and flag into h-11!" A thundering sound was heard, and, when the smoke cleared away, the flag which a few moments before had streamed out so defiantly was now no longer to be seen, and those who looked through the telescope could per- ceive that much damage was done to the building, and, from the seeming confusion amongst the persons on the plantation, that it was more than probable the captain's order had been obeyed. And now turn we to Rosale. Miss de Villerie, on learning the approach of the fleet, had gone up into a turret of the building, and taking with her the Confede- rate flag, resolved to die beneath its folds. Standing   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      287 out on the small balcony in front of the turret, she placed the staff firmly in one corner, and, clasping her arms around it, she stood awaiting the penalty of her rash course. Thus, when the shot struck one, it struck both; and when Madame de Breuil and her terrified servants sought Miss de Villerie, it was to find her wounded and bleeding beneath the folds of the "Southern Flag," whose every fold was saturated with the blood of this intrepid girl. "Let me die here!" she murmured, as they sought to restore and to remove her. 1"Oh! let me die beneath the folds of our own true banner.  I ask no greater glory than to share a like fate to those who have fallen beneath it,!" "This is an act of madness, dear Natalie," murmured Madame de Breuil, as she washed the blood from her wounds, and endeavoured to staunch it ere the physician would arrive. On the arrival of Dr. S   , he pronounced her wounds not dangerous, and, administering an opiate, left her, with the injunctions to Madame de Breuil that all exciting news should be kept from her, and no one should visit her until she was entirely well. With a constitution such as hers she was soon able to dispense with all services of the disciple of Escu- lapius, and her first resolve was to leave the city, or rather her home, which was now within the Federal lines. Ordering her carriage one morning, she drove, unaccompanied, to the St. Charles Hotel, and, sending her card to General B. F. Butler, requested an inter- view, as she desired to obtain passports to go into the Confederacy. She was shown into the reception-room,  &#xD;<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC7351-00000146"/> 288   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; and soon afterwards the General entered. Bowing to Miss de Villerie, who rose upon his entrance,' he said, "Madame, can I serve you?" "Yes, Sir," she answered, " if you are so disposed. I wish to obtain a couple of passports to go into the Confederacy, and trust you will have the kindness to grant them." "I am granting no passports at present, but in a few days I shall be happy to oblige you, or that is, as soon as Vicksburg shall be in our possession, which is momentarily expected."  "Am I to wait, General," she replied, "until Vicks- burg falls, for a passport?" I can grant none until that event." "Then," she responded, "I may as well take a fare- well to my hopes of getting one, for I am convinced you will not be troubled soon for them, as Vicksburg is regarded as an impregnable fortress." "I believe, Madame, that Forts Jackson and St. Phillip were also so deemed, but they were by our fleet regarded as but toy fortifications." "Rather formidable toys, I should judge, that kept at bay your fleet for four months, and when you did make the attack, held out seven days against all the engines of destruction that your imagination could devise." "Truly, this is the case, Madame; yet you must acknowledge your fleet is but a burlesque when com- pared to that of the Federal."

" Spare General Lovell, and do not term him traitor, for that is our name for him, if he deserves it of either; but remember him gratefully, for if he be a traitor you are indebted to him, and others of the same sort, for your present victory." "We are indebted to none save our own valour, Madame, which has placed us in possession of this city, and which will soon open the Mississippi River, which has been so long    closed from  Western commerce, and thus place within my power the'means to assist your starving population." "I was not aware, General Butler, that our popula- tion were in this condition before, and feel assured it must have been since your arrival, as thus all communi, cation has been cut off from whence supplies heretofore were sent to New Orleans." "No, Madame; when I arrived here I found them in a starving state, and it is not even the poor that have sought me for assistance, but I have had your wealthy men, slave-owners, to come   and plead to me   on their knees for bread for their families and food for their slaves."

There may be persons who have represented themselves as such, but they were neither Southerners or slave-owners. It were impossible that any one could have been in such a state of extreme distress, and in so short a time after your entrance, as before you came there was an abundance of provisions, and such a thing as a mendicant in our streets was unknown. Never, Sir, never, was there less pauperism known in the South (where it at all times exists less than in any part of the world) than since the war commenced, for our State Government provided against the wants of the families of her soldiers, and even in the country, in the differbnt parishes, so much is allowed to each family, say $20 to the wife, and $5 to each child, until it amounts to $50, and then it ceases. Besides this, provision is given them by the surrounding planters, and thus, you perceive, Sir, our poor are properly cared for. No, Sir, you may be assured there are none now in the city vile enough to take the oath, to save their property or obtain provision." "Madame, will you be so kind as to name some of those you imagine so loyal, and I will send for them this moment and prove to you that they will take the oath, and in your presence?" "Doubtless, Sir, as a man would deliver his purse to a highwayman. I could name many to you, Sir, that not even such a threat could intimidate, but I have no desire to compromise my friends."

Remain and subject the city to a bombardment (which vas threatened by Farragut) and perhaps perish with the women and children, with no means left them to defend it?" "There was no reason," he answered, "for the flight of these men, nor the destruction of property, and as for a bombardment it was never threatened." "Pardon me  , General Butler,; if I tell you that I am not dull of comprehension, and I do not know what other interpretation could have been put upon the words of Conmander Farragut, when he ordered that the women and children should be re-moved within forty-eight hours.

They are the flower of the land, and men that were most of them nursed in the lap of luxury, and this is why they fight so well, for history tells us that the patricians have been better soldiers than the plebians. They do not shrink from suffering, and already have given proof of their ability as warriors, orators, statesmen, ,and authors. Amongst the first named we place the im- mortal Washington, amongst the second, their names are too numerous to mention. Can you now deny our claims?"

"Twenty-five graduates of Harvard College," she scornfully replied, "I can point out to you, General, one company of the Parish of West Feliciana, inm which there is scarce an exception in it, and those who compose it are graduates of the first colleges, either in the North, South, or of Europe. They are each and everyone worth at least some four or five hundred thousand dollars, and thus you will perceive they were not educated, like most of your Northern young men, with the view of making their way in the world by their  &#xD;<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC7351-00000149"/> 294   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; talents-therefore I cannot admit a superiority of intellect.

"I am well aware," he responded, " of your vast wealth, but, Madam, when we look at all this we must consider that it is the poor slave who works for it, and that it is his hands that fill your purses and provide these luxuries, and that no personal endeavour on your part have ever placed one penny in your pockets. As for me," he added, "I would prefer to earn my bread by the sweat of my brow." "General, as we have broached this subject, what, presume you, must your soldiers have thought on arriving in New Orleans, to find the negroes pro- menading in the square and streets, dressed in broad- cloth, and some in silks and satins, carrying gold watches in their pockets, and looking better, and living better, than their poor families at home, whom they had left there in poverty to fight for the negro, and to loosen their bonds of slavery. Whtat were your sentiments?" "Oh, my dear Madame, as for me, I have ceased to be astonished at anything; and I must assure you that I am no Abolitionist, have never been one, nor have I any sympathy in this cause; I came here to fight for the Union, to restore order, and to feed your starving people."

This, Sir, may be a pleasant enough theory seated, as you are, in a cool apartment of the St. Charles, in the most delightful part of the city, and with ices to drink every hour, and when inclination prompts a pro- menade, seat yourself in an equipage; but if you would like the practice for a few moments, I would advise you to enter a cotton-field and begin your day of labour by pulling off your coat and exposing yourself to the sun's rays, and then take the cotton-bag in your hand, cull a few of the beautiful white blossoms that look so delicate, or take the hoe (if earlier in the season) and turn the soil up, even lightly, for a few hours, and then give me your idea of 'earning your own bread.' Theory, most usually, is pleasant--practice, seldom so."

Miss de Villerie was about to reply, but at this point a lady made her appearance at the door of the apart- ment, and said, addressing the General, "Before you go out I wish to see you." The General rose, and bowing, said, "I will attend you soon." Then the lady withdrew. She was ladylike and graceful in appearance, and Miss de Villerie being anxious to learn who it could be, remarked, "I was not aware there were ladies in the hotel now; I presumed they had all left the day of the arrival of the fleet."

"Well, Madam, I own they might have done worse than we did; for instance, we have a right to take the feather beds from under the people even, and it would only be considered just according to the rules of war- fare." "I assure you you are quite welcome to all the feather-beds you find; but fortunately we don't use them, spring mattresses are in vogue here; and now, General, I presume that I must leave without a pass, as you need not have the slightest hopes of placing Vicksburg within your lines." "We shall see, madam; and should you feel disposed to take the oath and return here within two weeks, I will provide you with a passport." "Bidding you good morning, General, I will state that I should not value nor accept a passport purchased at such a price," and thus saying she bowed low to the commander, who accompanied her to the door.

In a few days, the latter plantation was deserted by all the white inmates, and Miss de Villerie had gone to figure in other scenes. General Butler soon established his head-quarters at the Custom House, and the orders for confiscation and arrest began. He took possession of the residence of General D. F. Twiggs (the latter having left immediately on the arrival of the fleet), and also seized all the silver and articles of value he could find in the house, as well as the jewels of Mrs. Myer (the daughter of General Twiggs), but returned the latter by request of Dr. N. Mercer.  Ascertaining, through the domestics, that General Twiggs had left his swords in the keeping of the Florence family, as also some silver, he sent an order to the family to give them up, which they refused to do, asserting that General Twiggs had presented those articles to Miss Florence, but this was considered as a mere subterfuge, and General Butler took them without further ceremony. He forbade all display of Confederate badges, emblems, or other rebel demonstrations. Yet in the face of threats, and with Ship Island and Fort Jackson as the penalty, there were those reckless enough to sport the colours, and to meet, face to face, the Union officers and soldiers without a tremor for the con- sequences. Amongst the number famous for such conduct was Mrs. Phillips (formerly of Washington) and her daughters.

But I cannot say that I advocate such a course. It but exasperates the enemy, while it benefits the cause in no way. The only course to be pursued in such circum- stances is one of quiet dignity. I feel that all ladies of pride will agree with me in saying I would not care to sport my flag where it was simply tolerated, and could only feel at ease in wearing my colours where they floated triumphant. It was the mistaken zeal of some well-meaning, but rash and thoughtless persons, that created bitter sentiments and unjust facts to spring up and originate in the minds of the many, that a proper self-respect and guarded manner would have avoided. Before the city was invested, all acts of heroism were to be admired, but once it had fallen, the only course should have been a silent, cautious, and resolute endea- vour to bear the chains in cold disdain, until the moment should arrive when they might cast aside their shackles and walk forth free. But it would be useless to advise the almost frenzied citizens of New Orleans; and often when the commanding general was driving with all the state of office in his equipage, followed by twelve armed cavalry, he would see a Confederate fan flirted before him, or perhaps catch the glimpse of a head with a Confederate rosette, as it hastily, withdrew from a window on his approach.  &#xD;<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC7351-00000152"/> 300   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; In vain were menaces of vengeance; the Confederate emblems were everywhere seen, and sported even by the French, British, and Spanish officers. The Spanish man-of-war generally was crowded during the evening; and the commander, who was a most splendid performer on the piano, generally regaled the assemblies with Confederate music during the intervals of the dance; and the summer evenings passed off gaily in this man- ner, for those who remained in the city. Though Lincoln's emancipation proclamation had not been published, the negroes arrived in vast numbers every day in the city, as they heard their deliverers were come, and soon the plantations in the vicinity of New Orleans were depopulated, not through any will of their own, blut by the violence of the Yankee soldiery they were forced to leave their comfortable quarters, and take lodgings at the Custom House, where, being closely confined and treated to rations from the refuse of the soldiers, they became sick, and daily the remains of those who died were borne off in waggons to the commons, were a hole was dug in the damp earth, into which their bodies were rudely pitched and left to decay. Hundreds in this manner died and were buried; and when, half-starved and almost mad, they, in their moments of recreation, wandered through the streets with no kind glance to meet theirs, sadly they sighed for their comfortable cabins, and the green bright fields, where the breath of heaven fanned their cheeks, when the day's labour was ended. Gladly would they have returned, but alas! the spot once so dear to them was deserted, and the masters' or mistresses' kind smile would greet them never again.   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.       301 Do we blame you, ye misguided beings, for what ye were and are? No. Our hearts bleed for you, victims that you are to the lying hypocrisy that led you from all that could render your lives pleasant; and ten thousand curses rest upon your murderers, who tore you from the arms of repose and, happiness, only that they might see your bones bleaching upon the earth. "Vengeance is mine saith the Lord."   Ay! with blood shall blood be paid. Not alone were they tempted to leave their homes, ay, forced, but they were advised, like the Israelites of old, to " spoil the Egyptians," and daily were heard of ladies who were left without a gar- ment, or one article of dress orjewellery-the most valu- able articles were stolen, and the receivers were the officers and soldiers of the United States Army and Navy. All that could not be confiscated was purloined, and no redress could be had for any grievance whatever. General Butler at first did not countenance this con- duct on the part of the slaves, but General Phelps did, and the former, when the proclamation was issued, be- came as violent an Abolitionist as the latter, notwith- standing his asserting to Miss de Villerie that he sympathized in no way with the negroes, and his public , address to the authorities in Washington, where he ends by quoting from Lord Chatham's celebrated address:- "I will never consent to so vile an act, and if ye wish to adopt this course, you must find some other instru- ment to carry out your intentions, for I will never be used as such."

In vain do we attire ourselves in character; if the mask be not raised before the end of the pageant, it must fall from the face at its close, and when morning dawns we appear in our own garb. Once the mask dropped from General Butler's face he did not seek to conceal aught further, and we must admire his boldness and the entire indifference with which he regarded public opinion. The first men of New Orleans and its vicinity were arraigned before this absolute monarch, and for the most trifling offences were sent to Fort Jackson. Mayor Monroe, Dr. Stone, and others of celebrity, were imprisoned there, and now the clergy trembled for their safety, though many of them posi- tively refused to pray for the President of the United States, and were threatened with torture in conse- quence. One fact is here worthy of record, and this is, that the Reverend Father Mullen, of St. Patrick's Cathedral, resisted to the last all threats of the General's, and when called before the Commander said, in response to his menace of Fort Jackson, "Sir, I do not fear you in the least; and were you to dare to interfere with me, you would find your ranks of soldiery quickly thinned, as   more than two-thirds of your army is composed of Irish Catholics, and with them their God and Religion is first, and then their country; So touch me at your peril " General Butler, feeling the force as well as truth of the remark, made no further threat, but insisted on the prayer for the Confederacy being dispensed with, to which Father Mullen consented, and on the next Sunday made the following remarks:--" My Beloved Brethren, there are some here to-day who have listened to my voice of instruction from infancy to womanhood and manhood, and others who have but just entered the fold of which I am the shepherd. We have passed through various changes of life, and yet we never dreamed the hour would arrive when the invader would silence our tongues, or close our ears to the dictates of conscience; but it has come, the invader is at our, doors, and now we can only pray in silence for that which is dearest and nearest. Beloved Brethren, I have taught you how to pray, and what to pray, and now do your duty!!!" Comment is unnecessary. On another occasion he was requested by General Butler to officiate at the burial of an officer, and, to the inquiry of whether he would do so or not, he replied, "Most assuredly, with a great deal of pleasure; it will aford me happiness to bury the whole army !" Officers attended the various churches, not from motives of piety, but to act as spies upon the ministers. The places of worship were for a time deserted almost, as the inhabitants refused to bow at the altars of the same God with their cruel and heartless persecutors.

ONCE arrived in the Confederacy, Miss de Villerie sought to aid the cause of her people in contributing towards the support of the soldiers, and her first act was at Crystal Springs, Copiah- County, Mississippi. Madame de Breuil and herself, on entering Rebeldom, proposed remaining at the first village which would promise any degree of comfort, until they should be joined by Judge de Breuil, who had gone to Richmond. Learning that Crystal Springs was a quiet, beautifully-situated retreat, and free from soldiery, they determined to await the Judge there, and, accordingly, they engaged rooms at a cleanly-looking mansion in view of the railroad, and  &#xD;<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC7351-00000155"/> 306   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; which gloried in the poetic and floral name of "The May House." The proprietress of ttis establishment, a Mrs. May, was a lady of about sixty years of age, a thrifty, hard-worling dame of the olden time, and one who had constantly " many irons in the fire," as keeping boarders was not her sole means of subsistence, but together with keeping a loom, and sewing for the soldiers, she seemed to coin money. Hers was such a face 1" as would a home- spun dress adorn," and Miss de Villerie did not refuse to enter the weaving-room where the old lady invited her. After watching for some moments the manner in which the rosy, good-looking rustic lass (a :niece of the proprietress) dashed the shuttle to and fro, she sat down at the loom and commenced weaving with even more celerity than the rustic maid. The old lady was quite charmed at the "city gal's" condescension, and vowed she'd make "Elie " (her lubberly bumpkin son, whose name was Elijah) set up to her; "for," she ended, "arter all, when it kums to the pint, I believe the town gals is just as rashanal as the country wuns, and it all depends upon their fotchen up." After having weaved a quarter of a yard, which the old lady pronounced a "nashun site evener than Jemima's," Miss de Villerie was desired to walk out and see the gyardin (garden), and afterwards the chief beauties of each plant, ornamental and useful, were dis- cussed; the old lady pointed out a beautiful hedge of the Cayenne pepper, saying, "I alliz liked um, and them's purty to look at, and mazen healthy, and I'se tried to get a contract from the Government for furnishin the soldiers with bottles of pepper sarss, which would save a heap of sickness 'mongst 'um, but I couldn't git um to   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      307 do it, and I wan't gwine to make the vinegar and raise the pepper for nothin, so if they want sarss they may pay for it." Next Miss de Villerie was shown the process of smoking beef, which in the language of those who under. stand itis termed "jerked." The latter, though delight- ful to the taste (to those who have strength to masticate it), threatens momentarily to demonstrate the definition of its name. Miss de Villerie was next invitedto ride with the old lady in a search through the country after home- spun, which she intended purchasing to speculate upon, and forthwith they started in a nice little buggy, with one horse, which the dame herself drove. As they passed   through the country, Mrs. May explained to our heroine each object of interest, and drove to the beautiful and truly crystal spring from which the village derives its name. In the midst of a lovely pine forest, and at the base of charming hills, it gushes forth, and invites the weary traveller to a drink from its mossy brink. Miss de Villerie, getting out of the buggy drew near to the well of nature, and plucking a leaf from a small tree which grew near, formed it into a cup, and dipping it into the water, regaled herself with a draught of pure Adam  's ale. After this they re-entered the buggy, and drove to each and every cottage for miles around, and then returned to the May House, when Miss de Villerie recounted her adventures to Madame de Breuil, and dwelt upon the extreme poverty of what is termed the, "piney woods" people, and their extreme flth, and almost brute ignorance, concluding her account of them by saying that more intelligence, and more marks of x 2  &#xD;<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC7351-00000156"/> 308   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; civilisation might be found amongst the wildest and most roving tribes of the desert. But like all countries where great and intelligent men have existed, there may also be found their opposites. Ireland, amidst all her poverty, has produced some of the greatest lumi- naries of the world, and in her firmament has sparkled some of the greatest constellations of the British realm. Charonea, in Greece, gave to the world one of its great- est historians, and Plutarch is an example of where tie mire produced -a gem. Mississippi produced many brilliant men, and Kentucky a Jeff Davis, with many others whose intelligence more than compensate us for the ignorance of her masses. However partial we may be to Mississippi, for having given birth to illustrious statesmen, we cannot forgive her treatment of Con- federate soldiers, nor can we forget that on the retreat of the army from Tupelo they (the soldiers) were charged by the patriotic inhabitants twenty-five cents for a canteen of water, and ten cents for a glass! Think of this, Mississippians, and ye who boast of your deeds of patriotism. "By their works ye shall know them," and thus do we judge you. Coming generations shall point with the finger of scorn to this fact in history, and speak in trumpet-tones of the self-sacrificing spirit of those who ministered to the weary soldiers for filthy lucre. In sorrow do we trace the words which record your avari- ciousness, but truth alone we write, and therefore " let the galled jade wince." Long years after ye are gathered home, and when even the little mounds that mark your resting place lie level with the earth around it, these deeds will be your only mausoleum, to remind us that ye existed, and more huge this memorial shall be of ye   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.   i   309 than the pyramids of Egypt; but ye have erected it yourselves, and it is neither of stone, silver, nor gold, neither of iron nor brass, but of pinchbeck, emblematic of your narrow hearts. Sad is it that it should rain "alike on the just and the unjust," and though there certainly were more than " ten just," we could not spare. like Him, the rest. Miss de Villerie, who in her own State had witnessed naught but the most ardent endea- vours to add to the happiness and comfort of the soldiers, saw with feelings of surprise and indignation their treatment at every place in this State.   Famished soldiers ordered on a hasty movement to some point, and having no time for waiting to cook rations, would beg even for a crust of cold bread wherever they stopped, and were invariably refused. Becoming desperate at times, they would scale walls, leap fences, and break down gates to steal a few vegetables, such as turnips or onions, which  they would eat raw.   Occasionally a soldier more bold than the rest would shoot a chicken, or a turkey, and for this offence be severtly punished by the officer in command, whose well-filled stomach left him no room for sympathy with the starving soldiers. On all occasions the officers fared well, as wherever they went the best was at their disposal, but RANK was treated not MERIT. Miss de Villerie had just returned from Jackson, where she had been for some months, and was now established again at Crystal Springs. One morning towards the close of October Mrs. May, the proprietress, who has already been'presented to the reader, came into Miss de Villerie's room, and, seating  herself, re- marked, "Dr. R---   has jist bin to see me, and to ax  &#xD;<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC7351-00000157"/> 310   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; me to take into my house a sick soldier, but you knows yourself, Miss Villery, I hasn't any room." "Then, my dear Madame," exclaimed Miss de Vil- lerie, "I trust you will not refuse to take him on this account, as Madame de Breuil and myself will consent to occupy the same chamber, that you may give place to him. I assure you, I would much prefer yielding all claims to comfort, than one of those men should be deprived who has fallen ill for my sake and for yours." ("Wall," replied the old lady, whose features were seemingly carved out of stone, "I'll see him, and, if he ain't too sick, I'll have him fetched over, for he's lying now in the depot, and they talk 'bout takin him to the hospital at Magnolia," and so saying she left the room, and donning her sun-bonnet, left the house. In a few moments she returned, and said, "I'm not gwine to take him, for he's most dead anyhow; and, besides, he ain't got any money, and I'm too old to have the trouble of him, and ther's plenty folks in the neighbour- hood sides met" This was quite true, and so thought Miss de Villerie; but she replied, "My good Madame, it should be no reason that, because others act unkindly and uncharit- ably, we should follow their example; by no means, and I would much prefer your taking this man, as his being so ill is a greater call upon our charity. I beg you will do this, and I will endeavour to make him as little trouble as possible to yourself and servants, by waiting on him myself; and, if money be the object with you, I will pay you." "No, money hain't the reason," the old dame re- sponded  "but I  don't like sick folks in the house."   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      3" "Mrs. May," said our heroine, " did I understand you to say that this man is in the depot?" "Yes, and it's orful cold too thar, and it's jist bloin a perfect harricane out doors. I'm sorry, but, Miss Villery, I can't take him." Miss de Villerie arose, and, remarking to Madame de Breuil that she would go and see what she could do for him, and at the same time she took a couple of letters for the mail, as she wished this. to serve as an excuse for going to the depot, the post-office being at this place, and, owing to the absence of most of the gentle- men, the ladies now crowded the depot. Entering the dep6t, Miss de Villerie deposited her letters in the box, and then, casting a glance around the room, where several of the villagers were assembled, she perceived the sick man lying on a hard bench, and seem- ingly near dying. From his emaciated form, sunken cheeks, and hollow eyes, even the careless observer would know that he could not live many hours, and that the flickering light of life was about being extinguished for ever. Seated in the same room were the cold heart- less beings who had refused him shelter, and talking, laughing, smoking, and chewing, they sat there, view- ing with stolid indifference a fellow-creature's suffering and last hours. Miss de Villerie, who was exasperated almost beyond bounds at the brutal conduct of these men, turned to- wards the most respectable in appearance of the group, and asked, in a clear and imperative voice, "Is this the man you intend sending to the Magnolia Hospital?" "Yes, Madame," responded the gentleman addressed. "What, this man?"  she said; "why he does not  &#xD;<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC7351-00000158"/> 312   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; seem scarcely to have life in him, and how do you -imagine he will be able to make such a trip? Is there no person in Crystal Springs that will give him shelter until he is able to travel?  To send him now, in his weak state, and in such cold weather, will be murder. May I ask how came he here?" The dying man turned upon her his languid eyes, and opening them to their fullest extent, as it were, to gaze in wonder at this being who dared speak in his defence, said, "Lady, they would not have treated me so if I had had money; but," he added, "I did have a little, about $160, which my captain keeps for me, but now it is too late, it would not do me much good if I even had it." "Money!" exclaimed our heroine; " what do you want with money?  Should not every man's money be the soldiers' money, who have gone forth to defend their homes from the enemy, who spill their heart's blood for their country's safety, and expose themselves to all kinds of danger for the public defence? Money, indeed, my poor man; you are entitled to every man's money, and none save brutes could refuse you. Pro- tecting these people and their property has brought you to this, and while such lazy louts as are here as- sembled have been lolling on downy couches, eating and drinking of the best, you, poor man, were lying on the cold, damp earth, with your musket clasped close, even in your sleep, to your breast, that you might be ready for the foe at any moment; and now," she said, turning to those around her, "what must you think of your- selves, in a village of plenty, where no troops are quartered, that you refuse even to grant this man, this   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      313 soldier, a roof to shield him from the inclement weather, and a bed whereon to die? To term you savages and Hottentots would be to pay you a high compliment. I am houseless myself, or I would take you, my poor man," she said, addressing him. "I have already prof- ferred my room, if the person with whom I am boarding will take you, and, if there is any one to give you shelter, I will pay them." "Are you a Mississippian?" inquired the person first addressed by Miss de Villerie. "Mississippian!" she almost thundered out, "Mississi- pian! Oh! no, Sir. I would scorn the name; and if I had been so unfortunate as to have been born here, *I would, after" this example of their patriotism, and generous, high-souled, and charitable conduct, disown for ever all knowledge of such a State." Miss de Villerie left the room, and soon after return- ing to the depot with some brandy and port wine for the invalid, found that the people, brought to a sense of their duty by her bold and stern remarks, had lifted him on a mattress and taken him to the hotel on the opposite side of the rail-road, then placing him in bed, in the most comfortable room in the house, they sought by 'their attention to efface the unfavourable impression, and to gain a charitable reputation. Alas! the cloven foot had been displayed, and no arrangement of the drapery around the form of the hideous figure could disguise or erase the vision of its natural deformity. However, Miss de Villerie was delighted to think her conduct had been the means of even gaining for one human being repose in the last sad moments of his pilgrimage here, and proceeding to the hotel, she  &#xD;<pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC7351-00000159"/> 314   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; placed brandy, port wine, and tea in the hands of the proprietor of the house, to be used for the patient, 'and then made a search through the village for some one who would sell her a chicken at any price, to make soup for the invalid. She was fortunate enough to meet with a German woman who was kind enough to let her have one for 50 cents (at this time a most reasonable price) and paying her for it, had it sent to the May House, where she had a soup prepared, and took it herself to Stubbs' Hotel, where the sick man was quartered. Alas! it was almost too late for atten- tions, and he was too weak to eat the chicken, but sipped a few mouthfuls of soup from the spoon, which Miss de Villerie held to his lips. After remaining with him until late that night, Miss de Villerie returned to her hotel, at the same time extracting a promise from several men that they would remain for the rest of the night, and administer the medicine which the physician had ordered for him. Returning early the next morning, Miss de Villerie found the medicine on the mantel-piece, the room deserted, and the poor soldier evidently dying fast. She had said and done all she could; her vocabulary of invectives was exhausted the day previous, so, seating herself by the bedside, after she had wet his parched lips with brandy and water, she took the soldier's hand in her own, and while the tears hung upon her fringed lids, endea- voured to discover his name and family, that she might apprise them of his death. The day previous, he could speak distinctly, but now it was with difficulty she could make out what he said. At last she learned all that was necessary, his   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.       315 name, place of residence, and his mother's address, and also that he was the son of a widow-whose husband was an Episcopalian minister in Tennessee. .Miss de Villerie stayed with him  until dinner hour; when, returning with Madame de Breuil (who had offered to watch the poor man during the next night), they found that his spirit had fled from the coldness and sorrow of earth to its home in Heaven, where, we trust, that in the glory and happiness there he is amply repaid for his suffering here below. The tears fell fast over the form of the poor soldier; and I will do the town of Crystal Springs the justice to say that it did wash the body, and give it a clean shirt, as well 'as bestow a few feet of earth on the edge of the public road dand belonging to the government), and-to their honour be it said for ever-they did bury him. "Tennesseeans, remember your debt to Mississippians, you owe them one day's lodging for a soldier, and the price of six feet of public earth. I, Natalie de Villerie, am witness to it," said our heroine, as she sadly walked into the house from the gallery where she had remained gazing at the waggon which contained all that was mortal of a widow's hope. That night, Miss de Villerie seated herself to pen a letter to the bereaved mother, and she endeavoured to send balm for the wound which she knew the informa- tion would inflict, by stating the kind treatment her son had received in his last hours; and though she felt she was doing a foul injustice to the human race by slander- ing the inhabitants of Crystal Springs so greatly as to call them kind, Miss de Villerie did state that her son had received every attention in the power of the people of  &#xD;<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC7351-00000160"/> 316   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; Crystal Springs. At the same time she enclosed a lock of his hair, which she caused to be cut off, reserving another in case the first letter should not reach its destination; his canteen was the only souvenir of him that she could obtain, and she sent this to the express office at Vicksburg, to be forwarded to his mother, but was told there was no express farther than to Okolona. In a few weeks she received a response from the mother, a beautiful and grateful epistle, penned by the family physician, and in heart-inspired tones it breathed of gratitude. But now that we have broached this subject, we must not forget to give to the public the name of the chief actor in this scene. The young man whose melancholy end we have just recorded, was on his way on board the cars, with his company, to Camp Moore. The train being very much crowded, and having stopped for a few moments at this station, he got out to walk about, and when the whistle sounded, and the cars started, he endeavoured to get on again, but was pushed off by the crowd, and left behind. Wandering around the village, he was met by a man living in the neighbourhood, who, though not the representative of a Southern planter, was a very rich person, and owned a number of slaves. He lived in the vicinity of the village, and was considered the wealthiest person in the neighbourhood. This day he happened to be in town, and meeting with the soldier, asked him to accompany him home in his buggy, and remain until he got well, which invitation the poor fellow gladly and thankfully accepted. In a few days after his arrival, Mr. Robinson (for   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      317 such is the person's name) went off to some place, most probably to Jackson, where he intended remaining some days.  Mrs. Robinson, finding the man was becoming worse instead of better, and considering him very troublesome, determined to send for the village doctor, with the view of obtaining an order for his removal to the hospital. She having accomplished this, on a cold and blustering day in October, the man was told by Mrs. Robinson that she had ordered the buggy, and that the driver would take him to the depot, whence he could go to the Magnolia Hospital. The poor man arose from his bed, the picture of death, and started out into the cold air, less cold than the heart that turned him forth. Two days after, God released him from his pain, and we trust He may forgive the unkindness of those into whose hands he fell. Had this woman been a person who had never been a mother there might possibly be an excuse for such conduct, but in one who had herself lost a son a few months before on the battle-field, and who was told that it was not certain where or how he died, it cannot be over- looked. Lost to all feeling must that mother be who can gaze upon the sufferings, in any form, of the child of another and not feel that perhaps her own may yet be in the same condition, and need a friend. Base, beyond conception, are those who can view the necessi- ties and miseries of their fellow-beings and not seek to relieve them. But "Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord, I will repay." The soldier was buried on the evening of the last day of October, 1862, and the next day Miss de Villerie, according to the custom in New Orleans on All Saints' Day, gathered a few blossoms and, accom-  &#xD;<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC7351-00000161"/> 318   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; panied by a young lady of the village, strewed them over the grave of the humble dead.   Seven other soldiers were sleeping beneath the brown hillocks, and Miss de Villerie was alike thoughtful of them as she strewed the blossoms around. Kneeling at the head of each grave, she breathed a fervent prayer to the One who alone can give either celestial or terrestial peace, and transcendently beautifiul was the tableau, as with hands clasped, and eyes raised to heaven, she knelt in holy prayer. The last rays of the setting sun, as it glinted through the autumn foliage, fell upon her; and it seemed to enfold her in its last embrace, and to cast a halo around her which nought save a celestial being could wear. She arose from her knees as the last rays of the sunlight died in the West, and, as she turned to leave the spot, she raised her hand, and making the sign of the cross in the air above the eight sleeping forms, thus consecrated their resting-place, and departed for home. Judge de Breuil arrived at Crystal Springs a few weeks after, and Madame de Breuil and Miss de Villerie left without regret the village which, possessing all the natural characteristics of beautiful scenery, will be always engraven on her memory as the most frightful of all spots on earth, from the unpleasant circumstances above-mentioned. Miss de Villerie, on arriving in the capital, joined at once the association for contributing towards the wants of the soldiers, and in her dress of Confederate grey she might be seen every morning at the rooms of the various societies, aiding with money and counsel to the utmost of her power. Miss de Villerie was charmed with the   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      319 patriotic spirit of the ladies of Richmond and Virginia generally, and, in her letter to her friends in New Orleans, spoke of their conduct in the most glowing terms. And well the maidens of Virginia deserved her admiration, for more faithfully than the vestals of Rome did they tend the sacred fire of patriotism, and kept it blazing brightly amidst the dim clouds of war. South Carolina's women are also worthy of undying praise, and many a wearied soldier will long remember the bright faces and willing hands of those he met at the "Soldiers' Rests " (established by the side of the railroad, tended by ladies and their servants), and the generous attention received there. The scene presented on the arrival of the different trains at the various stations were interesting to the : beholders, as, laden with provisions, the ladies flocked towards the cars bearing abundance of fruit and delica- cies, as well as the more substantial articles of diet -viz., bread, and meats cooked in every manner, made doubly delicious by being bestowed by the fair and lovely women of the South. On every hand they administered aid to the weary soldiers, and in filling canteens with water and milk, and in distributing loaves of bread, these ladies would stand for hours seemingly unwearied, smiling and speaking words of encourage- ment and good counsel to the rough and stern-looking soldiers, who, in their dusty attire, formed a strong contrast to the lovely women and girls by whom they were served. . Much lighter felt the knapsack of the trudging infantry man as he turned from one of these "'Rests," and stouter grew his heart when he felt he was not fighting uncared-for, and that kind ,  &#xD;<pb n="320-321" xml:id="VAC7351-00000162"/> 320   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; hearts and gentle hands were ready to nurse him should disease lay low his form or render him unfit for service. Willingly, devotedly, worked the women of the South for the promotion of the Confederate cause, and day and night in untiring labour were their fair hands employed in knitting, sewing, and mending for the army, and the most expensive articles of dress were sacrificed to provide comfortable apparel. Elegant India shawls were cut up and made shirts of, while silk, satin, and mering dresses were sacrificed in the same manner. Carpets were dispensed with in every mansion, and when army blankets became scarce, these were formed into blankets for the soldiers. Everything that could be found about the homes and in the apartments of the rich, were bestowed at once upon the public altar for the use of the country as soon as its value was known to the possessor. Few were the cases in which those who could bestow refused, and when such were met with, and the avaricious being who refused was known, the Government, like a sensible mother, said to the base and ignoble child, "Your brothers and sisters have divided their portion with you, and now I shall force you (since fair means have proven ineffectuaD to share with them," and accordingly she acted. How proud, how gratified, must those persons be who generously came forward when the tocsin first sounded and placed their all at stake for the country! How happy they must feel to think they did not wait, like many others, to have it all swept from them, and by the foe; and who, in their ruined state, are now left to wander homeless, without the t/hanks or eulogy those   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.       321 will ever receive who spring to the assistance of their treasury at the first cry of alarm! In vain those selfish individuals looked forward to peace, and in vain they counted their rich herds and flocks, hoping that the storm of war would pass over their heads, and leave them   possessed of their treasure. "All is vanity," saith the preacher, and these beings proved the truth of the proverb. Sans remorse, we have seen the torch applied to hundreds-ay, thousands, of cotton-bales which were heaped in the gin-houses of these national thieves, and with delight we witnessed the ruin of those miserable narrow-minded specimens of the human race, that were ever ready, for avarice' sake, to plant the poignard in the heart of patriotism.  Yes, I have seen these "Gods of their idolatry cast to the earth." "And the widows of Ashur were loud in their wail, And the idols were broke in the temple of Baal." Not less, kind reader, were the widowers; and wheyn the moment shall dawn wherein our country shall havo properly chastised these worshippers of false gods, let us hope that they will view, with different ideas, their former misguided actions, and in the freedom of their country kneel with us in the worship of the true God, and of liberty. y  &#xD;<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC7351-00000163"/> 322   THE HEROWE OF THE CONFEDERACY; CHAPTER XIX.

"MADM, are you willing to-undertake this business?" said General J-,-", to a lady who ',had just entered his tent, escorted there by one of the General's sta officers. i"Most assuredly, General," she replied!"Do I look like one that would fear the consequences, if resved po Then, Matdam  , I feel I can safely entrust you with this despatch," he said, as he handed to her a folded paper, " and trust to hear of your successful entrance into L----, and your safe exit once your mission be ended.

He will wear a slouched felt hat, and over his left eyebrow you will perceive a deep scar. You will deliver to him, without delay, the paper; and now, dear Madam, this accomplished, I shall hope for the pleasure of meeting you again." The lady arose, and bowing to the General, was escorted to her carriage, and was soon on her way to L- -. On arriving in L---, she drove as directed to the House. She soon procured a room, and entering made a hasty toilette, and descended to the drawing- room. There she sat for hours, and looked and looked in vain for the person to whom she was to deliver the despatches. She knew not at what moment she would be arrested, and probably searched, as she had been sus- pected on a former visit to the place as a spy. She at last (when day commenced to close, and he had not made his appearance) resolved to retire to her chamber, feeling fatigued and annoyed. Once in her apartment, she began to think of some means of secreting the despatch, as she feared keeping it about her person. In her fear no place seemed safe, and after thinking of several modes of concealing it, decided on placing it under the carpet. She was just in the act of stooping down to raise the carpet, when a rap -at the door startled her, and the blood rushed from her heart in terror. She unlocked her door, however,' and to her amazement she received from the waiter the card of a Federal officer. Though it was one whom she had some acquaintance Y 2  &#xD;<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC7351-00000164"/> 324   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; with, and who had done her several acts of kindness in his official capacity, she knew not at this moment to what cause she should attribute his visit. In her con- fusion she knew not what to do with the paper, fearing that should she leave it in the room, it might be found there (should they have it searched during her absence); having no time to conceal it with any certainty of safety, and presuming that at the very moment, probably, she would not have it ready to deliver when the person would call; resolving, however, to dare the worst, she placed it in her pocket, and proceeded to the drawing-room. The cordial manner of the officer soon placed her at ease. A few moments passed in agreeable converse, when Colonel D  , said, "With your permission, I shall be most happy to present to you my friends General G d and Major N  n." With a feeling of uneasiness Miss C-- consented, saying "I shall be most happy," when excusing himself, he withdrew, and returned in a few moments with two gentlemen, whom he introduced to her. She conversed for an hour or more quite affably, and then being asked to sing and play, arose, and seated herself at the piano, thus placing her back towards the door. She struck the chords nervously, and was so excited she could scarcely command her voice to sing. She had not been long thus, however, when the door opened, and turning to see who had entered, she beheld the person to whom the despatch was to be delivered. Recognizing her at once, he came forward, saying,- "I am pleased to see you again, Miss C--; when I left you about three hours since, I went to my aunts,   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.     1,325 and informed them of your arrival;, they will be down to see you in the morning." Surprised at his cool manner, she said, "I shall be pleased to see your aunt and Cousin Mattie." "May I request you to continue your musical enter- tainment of your friends," he rejoined; " do not permit my entrance to interrupt your performance," and leaning on the piano, he said, "By-the-way have you written, or rather copied those words of 'Lorena,' which you promised me this morning?" Taking the hint, she replied, as she drew forth the despatch,' and threw it on the .piano, "Yes Charles, I scribbled them off this morning. I doubt if you can read them, but I assure you you may make the most of this copy, as I dislike of all things copying." Taking up the paper, he said, with nonchalance, as he placed it in his vest-pocket, "Thanks, many thanks," and after waiting some fifteen minutes, said, "I have an engagement with a party of gentlemen, and if you will excuse me, will go and keep it, and return in one hour hence." "Au revoir, then," she answered ; "but remember, if later than an hour hence, you will not find me in the parlour, and I shall ask you to excuse my receiving you until to-morrow." ' I shall return in an hour," and bowing to the gentle- men, he left the room. Feeling free now that the despatch was out of her possession, she soon excused herself on the plea of fatigue, to the officers, and -left the room, after having summoned a servant, in the presence of the officers, to whom she said,-  &#xD;<pb n="326-327" xml:id="VAC7351-00000165"/> 326   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; "1You will say to a gentleman who will ask for me this evening, that I am quite indisposed, and will see him in the morning.' Once alone in her apartment, and the paper no longer in her possession, she breathed a sigh of relief, and sought her couch to seek repose, for the first time since she had undertaken the mission. Of course, friend Charles did not return, and it is more than probable these patriots had met for the first and last time on this side of the grave. Miss C---- determined she would not leave the city with a less important object than she entered, so remained several days, until learning that the bridge between the Federal and Confederate lines had been destroyed, to prevent an attack on the city, which it was rumoured was contemplated by General M---- that night, she resolved to cross the lines, and thus give warning to the Con- federates. She sought her friend, the Federal officer, and stated that it was absolutely necessary she should reach home in two days, and implored him to obtain her a pass. "Are you aware, Miss C  , that there is no exit in the direction you wish to go, the bridge having been destroyed?" I am aware of that, Colonel D . Only obtain a pass for me to leave, I will find the means to cross the bridge."              * "Why, my dear lady, nought remains save the beams, the flooring has been removed; and surely you would not venture upon the beams without further sup- port."   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      327 "Obtain the pass, Colonel. and you will see whether I will or not." "Then be it as you desire, fair lady," and, leaving the apartment, soon returned with the desired pass. "Thanks, Colonel, thanks; I value this pass more than my life." Miss C   left the city in a few hours, led over the beams of the bridge by a Federal soldier! By this fearless act she saved the destruction of General M and his whole force. On arriving in the Confederacy, she at once proceeded to the head-quarters of General J . It is needless to say that he received her kindly, and once again placed in her hands despatches. These were of much greater importance than the former, and were to be borne several hundred miles.   They were written upon two small slips of paper. One of these slips of paper she rolled tightly, and placed in the top of a quill tooth-pick; the other she folded and placed conveniently, that, at a moment's warning, she might place it in her mouth. She- had many miles to travel, and, seating herself in a rude conveyance, a carry-all (on the style of an army ambulance), she started upon her hazardous expedition. Her driver was a negro man, and, with some degree of doubt, she had resolved to go with him. They drove all the first day through a lonely plain, and at night stopped at a plantation. Early on the next morning they began their journey, and late in the evening came upon the head-quarters of General R  , situated on the river R   ; and some twenty miles beyond this point it was necessary she should cross the river, and' this would place her within the Federal lines. As she  &#xD;<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC7351-00000166"/> 328   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; stopped in front of the tent (or rather as the conveyance stopped) she bade the negro to summon a soldier, and ask him to request the General to step to the carriage (we will thus dignify it), that a lady wished to speak with him. A soldier advancing, he and the driver entered the General's tent, and in a few moments re- appeared with the General, who walked at once up to the carriage, and, politely bowing to Miss C  , re- marked, "Madame, can I serve you?" "You can, Sir, if you desire."        1 "In what manner, Madame?" "I wish to cross the river some twenty miles distant from here, and to enter the Federal lines. Will you be so kind as to furnish me with a pass?" "Most assuredly not, Madame. I would not permit at this moment a colonel of our army to do so. I regret it, Madame; but I cannot comply with your request." "You will let me pass, General," she said, smiling, as, stooping down, she drew off her shoe, " and in less than ten minutes." "Not if I know myself,;' he rejoined. Raising the shoe, she handed it to him, at the same time saying, "General, does this article look imperative, commanding, authoritative, or anything in that style?" He answered her, though his risibles were much affected, "Madame, there was a time in my life that the sight of a slipper might awe me, but I am past that age." "Not yet, General," she said; "you are still under dominion of sole leather." Pressing the heel of the shoe, the sole flew apart,   OR, TRUTH[ AND JUSTICE.      329 and therein lay a small strip of paper, which, taking out of its bed, she handed to the General. He glanced at it, and said, "I have nothing further to say, Madame. You shall have a pass." It less than ten minutes it was in her possession, and she was on her way. It became quite dark as she reached the river, and in a dense swamp, with the rain pouring in torrents, she was forced to abandon further travel. Imagine the scene, gentle ladies, in your quiet homes. Out in a lonely marsh, the rain falling, thunder rolling, lightning flashing, the terrified birds screaming in the midnight air, with venomous reptiles around you, and a burly negro, dark as Erebus, as your sole companion. Imagine yourselves thus, and seated back in the corner of a dilapidated vehicle, with your hand grasping a revolver, and your thumb upon the trigger, not daring to close your eyes; the negro a stranger to you, and fearing lest he should prove less gentle or merciful than the elements. If you have, dear ladies, 'imagination to picture this to yourselves, you can form some idea of what one of your own sex suffered in her character of Confederate emissary. The negro was true to his trust, and in this act might have put to the blush many a free man, with fair face, but with a black heart. Here was beauty, youth, and money, all within the negro's reach; yet, like " an honest man, the noblest work of God," he laid him down to rest, with the warring elements as his lullaby, and when morning's roseate stole upon the world once more, he arose, and they proceeded on their journey. God bless you, noble man! You are a bright example of the "genus homo."  Yes, erring, sinful man! As  &#xD;<pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC7351-00000167"/> 330   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; you read this does it not strike home? Ponder upon it, ye who have injured the brightest beings! Ponder upon it, ye who have had charge of the youthful maiden, and have destroyed her!  Ponder upon it, ye. who have blighted homes, and sent the gray-haired sire to his grave with a broken heart! Ponder upon it, ye who have ruthlessly torn from her home the young and fair, and have then cast her from you to sink in the mire of destitution and disgrace! Yes, go think of it, and compare your heart with that of this dark son of Afric, and ask yourselves whose crown should be the brightest in that home to which we are all passing, slowly but surely, and where He who sees all hearts shall judge. There, indeed, will appear dis- tinction, not of skin, but soul. Oh! could we but remove the silver veil, so dazzling, from the faces of some we deem so fair, would not we, indeed, find re- vealed the loathsome visage of a Mokenna? Miss C--- soon arrived at the point from which she would be forced to continue her journey alone, as the negro could not venture further. She bade adieu to her faithful attendant, and after having purchased a mule and a buggy, seated herself in it, and was soon on the other side of the river, on what is termed neutral ground-being within Federal authority at one time and Confederate at other, as well as being infested with guerilla bands, making it dangerous for any one to venture within the limits. On the side to which Miss C--  crossed, ran a road, in a direct line of a mile and a half, through a dense swamp, bordered with oak and cypress, whose sombre forms were rendered still more so by the Spanish moss   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      331 which drooped in festoons from the boughs; the under- brush was impenetrable, while weeds and coarse marshy plants grew in profusion; the decaying trunks of trees formed asylums for the serpents which the traveller might observe trailing across the road, or coiling them- selves around the huge bodies of giant lords of the forest. Miss C---   shuddered as she entered upon this scene, but felt that if it were only these reptiles to fear she could brave them undaunted; she grew faint as she thought of the human eyes that might be staring upon her, whose glance was more deadly than the serpents'. She summoned all her courage, and rising in her seat, struck the mule with the hickory-rod (in lieu of a whip), and plying it well, she almost flew past thnis mile of horrors, and soon entered upon a less dangerous part of the country. Warm, weary, and soiled with dust and mud, she arrived in the suburbs of M--, and at the station where a train every half-hour conveyed the passengers into the city. She was just about congratulating her- self upon the success of her journey, when, in front of the depot in M-  , two officers stepped up to the train, and just as she was descending from the car, one of them accosted her, saying, "Miss C-- , I presume?" "Yes, Sir." "I regret exceedingly, then, that I am under the painful orders to arrest you." The passengers becoming quite excited at this, an old lady ran forward, and placing her arms around Miss C--, said, "Oh, dear, what have you done, young lady? I trust you have not been guilty of any crime."  &#xD;<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC7351-00000168"/> 332   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; Miss C-- answered in dignified tones, "PrayI do not be alarmed, dear madame, I have committed no crime, nor have I offended in any manner against the ten commandments; permit this gentleman to perform his duty. I am quite ready," she said, " to accompany you, Sir, and may I ask upon what charge I am arrested?" "I regret to state I am not fully informed, but think it is simply on suspicion as a spy. We will go to the ladies' waiting room of the depot, madame, where I will leave you in the charge of a couple of soldiers, until such time as I can summon some ladies to search you." She bowed, and withdrawing from the crowd they were soon in the apartment mentioned. Calling a couple of soldiers, he said, "You will guard this lady until my return, and do not for a moment withdraw your eyes from her; pardon me, lady, such is their duty;" and taking up her cabasse, he said, "I will keep this safe for you, and hope, for your own sake, you may prove innocent of any charge against you." Miss C--, now   left alone with her guards, pro- ceeded to scan their appearance. Their faces were ruddy  and smiling, and bespoke them honest plain fellows. She entered into conversation with them at once, and turned the subject upon home and friends. She could perceive their eyes fill as they spoke of loved ones there, and, knowing she had not a moment's time to spare, said, when she felt their hearts were filled with tender memories, "Just see that great boy in front of the door imposing on that little urchin--is it not shameful?"  They turned, as quick as a flash of lightning the tooth-pick was in the grate by which they were   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      333 standing; and when they turned their eyes upon her, she was quietly poking the fire. One despatch still remained, and what to do with it she knew not-to destroy both she could not bear the thought of it, and after undergoing so many difficulties in reaching this point. Time was flying, their eyes were up- on her, and she could not, dare not, place her hand in- her pocket, to pull out her purse (in which the other despatch lay) and open it before them. She glanced at every object, did everything to divert their attention, and at last saw an old fruiterer passing the door. She turned to the soldiers, and said, "I am very thirsty, and hungry as well, would you not let me have some apples? You do not object to my purchasing, do you?" "Certainly not, lady." "Then call the man;" at the same time drawing forth her purse and emptying the contents into the palm of her hand. Miss C--  paid for the apples, and saying "Help yourselves, my good men," returned the money to her purse, keeping the despatch in her hand. Peeling an apple, she cut a small piece, and placed it with the despatch in her mouth; and, laughing at the time, pretended she was quite choked, and coughed violently, thus finding an excuse to place her finger in her mouth, and arranged the despatch between her cheek and gum. She now felt safe; and it was with an air of indifference she viewed the return of the officer, in a few minutes after, and the ladies, with whom he entered. The officer left the females to perform the work, and withdrew. Miss C----   stood viewing them contemp- tuously, as they undressed her, and searched each  &#xD;<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC7351-00000169"/> 334   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; article of clothing-ripping open hems, letting out tucks, and tearing away the linings of her garments. Satisfied with this, they next proceeded to take down and comb out her hair, apologizing for this last act, Miss C-- not even condescending to acknowledge it. She was quite determined they should do their work alone, and stood quite nonchalant as they undressed and re- arranged her toilet. When finished, her national-paid femme des chambres, left the room mortified, not even having claimed the perquisites of the office. The officer now entered, and said, "Madam, you are quite at liberty, and I will take pleasure in placing my carriage at your disposal to proceed to the hotel." Miss C   thanking him, accepted his polite offer, and was soon in her apartment at the hotel.  One despatch reached its destination, when she returned once again into the Confederacy. Miss C--   was untiring in her efforts to promote the interests of her country, and Louisiana and Tennessee are as much indebted to her as Virginia to Miss Belle Boyd (the present Mrs. Hardinge). The latter's career, though more brilliant and dashing, is not more praise- worthy.  Miss Clayton and Miss B  were kindred spirits. The former was to General T  in Louisiana what Miss Boyd was to Stonewall Jackson in Virginia. Both risked life and liberty for the Southern cause. Miss Boyd's patriotism gushed forth like the mountain torrent; Miss Clayton's, like a hidden spring in the desert-each alike destined to empty in the sea of glory.

They gently bore the litter towards the room, as directed, and entering they placed him upon the pure white couch. The lady sent an attendant to summon the surgeon, and placed bands and lint convenient for his use when he should arrive. The surgeon soon entered, and prepared to examine the wounds. Anxiously the lady awaited to learn his opinion, and when he whispered softly, "Poor young gentleman, his race is almost run; not many hours ere Death shall claim him," she clasped her hands, and bowing her head, prayed for his souil's rest in that clime where no evil cometh, and her tears fell fast for those to whom he should return no more. "You will please summon Soeur Secessia to attend this patient," the Doctor said; "she is a fitting nurse, and well prepared to prepare one for such a journey as he is soon to enter upon." "I am sorry to say she is at the upper hospital, Doctor, but if you will call and say to her as much, she will, I know, return here at once. She felt that the invalids at the other hospital were neglected, and went there to remain a week; but I am certain she will not refuse to return here if requested by you to do so."

Like a new star, she beamed in the clouded firmament of the sick and suffering. She was welcome everywhere, and in her floating black serge garb, and religieuse cap, she glided through the chamber, tending the sick, speaking words of hope and comfort to the sorrowful, praying with the despairing, kneeling beside the couch of the dying, and placing wreaths on the brow of the dead. The small apartment which was allotted to her was now occupied by the wounded Federal officer. The couch upon which she sometimes reclined when overpowered by fatigue, was simple in its style, and covered with snowy dimity, spoke of purity. The room was devoid of all luxury, as a hermit's cell. One large window descending to the floor, was cur- tained with the same material as the couch. Graceful, wreaths of woodbine and wild yellow jessamine looped back the drapery from the casement, permitting balmy breezes to float through the room. A crucifix twined with garlands of sweet briar and honeysuckle, was sus- pended over the mantelshelf, while two vases filled with myrtle and orange blossoms, completed the ornamental part. Three cane-seat chairs and a lavabo, and you have a list of the furniture. The officer lay in this chamber, seemingly uncon- scious, nor did he move even when the door softly opened, and a form glided to his bedside. His face was covered, and turned from her, but one of his hands lay outside. Taking it in her own she felt the pulse, and then summoning a domestic, ordered a basin of ice- water and lavender. Turning up the cuffs of her habit:, she prepared to bathe his temples, and softly drew the 7.  &#xD;<pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC7351-00000171"/> 338   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; cover from the face, when the officer, opening his eyes, turned them upon her. She cast her eyes down, as he rested his gaze searchingly on her face, and she said, quietly, "Pardon me, Sir, I should not have disturbed you, but I was only going to lave your brow." "Can it be?" he faintly murmured, "or am I but dreaming, and yet it is the voice." Soeur Secessia raised her eyes, and they rested full upon his face.  She  grew pale, and wildly crying, "Clarence, Clarence," she threw herself on her knees beside the couch, saying, -"At last we have met. Oh, God, that it should be thus ordained." The wounded officer, with all the energy of an almost dying struggle, raised himself, and bending over the side of the couch, clasped his arms around the kneeling form, as he said, "Yes, darling Natalie, we have met, and I to release you from your promise in a few short hours; tell me, oh tell me, ere I die, that in heart you have been true to me, and reveal the reason for this strange apparel." While sobs choked the utterance, she answered, "Clarence, beloved, when I had strength to sacrifice you on the altar of my country, I needed not so great a struggle to renounce the world. You were my world. Without, all was as a fearful night. I donned this garb that none should love me more; that voice of man should never breathe to me of love again. They are but worn for the period in which I attend here. I did not vow to wear them. Say, tell me, was not this love?"

Oh, Clarence, Clarence, would to God it were but a dream!" He caught her to his heart and impressed a kiss on her brow, while the hot tears (which physical pain had failed to draw forth) fell upon her burning cheek. "Natalie," he said, "I wish to see thee as in the olden time. Cast aside this cap, dearest, in this last parting hour." She threw off the religieuse hood, and her hair thus unconfined fell in sweeping tresses around her, like a sombre pall. She knelt beside him, and bowed her head upon his throbbing bosom. The excitement caused by this scene brought on a hemorrhage, and feeling some- thing cold dripping upon her, she glanced up, and found his life-blood streaming over her dark hair. She sprang to her feet, uttering a cry of despair, to summon assist- ance, but he held her firmly, and, as a smile of ineffable happiness wreathed his lips, said, "Let us be  alone, Natalie; it is meet we should thus part, and may He who parts us, hear my prayer, and grant that we shall at last meet where there shall be no more griefs, trials, or separations; and may God for ever guide, guard, and bless thee.

Clarence, Clarence, thou knowest not all I have suffered-the anguish caused by the vow to which I was impelled by an imperious conscience, and which I must hold sacred, as it was sworn to the dead and registered in heaven, by death alone to be absolved." "Thou wilt be mine above, darling," he answered; we were not destined for each other here." She kissed his pale brow, and twining her arms around him, said, "Yes, thine indeed above."  Silence, like a shadow, rested for a moment, and then folding her to his heart, he murmured, "Farewell, press closer to my heart, its last struggle will soon be over.

She wrung her hands wildly, and then madly clasped him to her heart with a cry of intense agony, saying imploringly, "Stay with me, Clarence, or pray that God may permit us to enter upon this un- known shore together. I cannot bear to think of your entering upon the labyrinthianwpassage to the world of shades alone."

One heart-rending shriek burst upon the startled inmates of the hospital, and the surgeon entered the apartment with an officer of high rank. The two stood in speechless amazement gazing upon the scene, while the room was filling with the frightened convalescents, attendants, and servants. Seated upon the couch, pressing in her arms the rigid corpse of her lover, her long raven tresses (clotted with his life-blood), streaming around her, her dress of black serge stained with gore, and her dark eyes staring upon his marble face. The surgeon was first to approach her, and, as he did so, she clasped the form of her lover more tightly, saying, t' You shall not take him from me, in death at least he's mine." The officer now approached, and, with the surgeon, disengaged her hold, when she fell in their arms fainting. The officer regarded her features attentively for some moments, and said slowly to himself, as he placed her in charge of the female attendants, "I feel it is the same, yet how changed.

Soon the story rang through the city, and Soeur Secessia was borne to the mansion of Mrs. General L:-, where she received every attention. The shock,' it was supposed, was such that she could not speedily recover from. Tlhe Federal officer, Major Clarence Belden, was interred with the honour due to his rank, and the small chamber, where he breathed his last in the embrace of Miss Natalie de Villerie, was closed by order of the Commanding General, made sacred to his memory, and only permitted to be entered by Soeur Secessia (as she was now known). Nought was removed, the flowers withered in their vases, the woodbine and jessamine wreaths decayed and scattered their petals and leaves upon the floor, the alpine-hued dimity changed to amber- tint, and silence hung its mournfill pall around S(EUR SECESSIA'S CELL.  &#xD;<pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC7351-00000174"/> 344   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; CHAPTER XXT. "Why should this man So mock us with the semblance of our kind? Moor! Moor! thou dost too daringly provoke, In thy bold cruelty, th' all-judging One, Who visits for such things! Hast thou no sense Of thy frail nature I 'Twill be taught thee yet; And darkly shall the anguish of my soul, Darkly and heavily, pour itself on thine, When thou shalt cry for mercy from the dust, And be denied!" AMONGST the first plantations that were seized were those of Mr. Milleudon, one termed the Milleudon, and the other the Estelle.  The atrocities committed on these places by both the Federal soldiery and the negroes are beyond description. I will, however, en- deavour to give an account of some of the scenes which transpired. It. was in the month of October, '62, that Colonel Thomas and Captain Lynes, of Co. I, 98th Vermont, were sent to take possession of the plantations just mentioned, belonging to Mr. Milleudon. Captain Lynes informed Mr. M   that his plantations were in posses- sion of the United States Government, and that they would take off the crop. Mr. M  went immediately to New Orleans, and, having consulted some of his friends,   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      345 was advised to call on General Butler, which he did at once, and was told by the General that he would make inquiry in regard to the affair. BMr. M   , after having left General Butler, called upon the General's brother, Colonel Butler, to endeavour to make some arrangement for the sale of his crop, but, failing to come to satisfactory terms, he entered into a bargain with a Mr. Benjamin F. Smith, the latter agreeing to protect the plantations and take off the crops. Colonel Butler, or rather General Butler, hearing of this arrangement, sent -a company of coloured soldiers to the plantations to take possession, When Mr. Mil- leudon returned to his home he found that his negroes had been tampered with, and that they were completely demoralized. The overseer complained repeatedly of the insubordination of the slaves, and of one especially, called Freeman. Mr. Milleudon summoned Freeman before him, and rebuked him for his impudence to the overseer, and threatened him with chastisement, when the negro actually attacked his master, and, a scuffle ensuing, they both fell to the ground. By some most fortunate chance, Mr. M    obtained possession of his revolver, which, the negro perceiving, relinquished his hold and fled. Mr. M    then returned to the city, and' the first thing he heard from his plantation was that the negro Freeman had seized an axe, and incited the slaves to revolt, and had made an attack on the overseer, who was obliged to fly to his house for safety. The negroes then surrounded the house, into which they fired several shots. The overseer, being armed, returned their fire bravely, until, wounded and exhausted, he sank upon I  &#xD;<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC7351-00000175"/> 346   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; the floor. The negroes then determined to set fire to the building, observing which, the overseer endeavoured to creep out at the back door, and by this means to make his escape; but he was observed, pursued by the negroes, overtaken, and hewed to pieces. Freeman, having been the ringleader, was arrested, with one or two others, and taken to the city for trial, and are still in gaol (or were up to February 1, '64) await- ing sentence. General Butler had arrested, some few weeks after his arrival, the man who had torn down the flag from the Mint, and he was placed in confinement until the month of August, when, after a trial, he was sentenced to be hanged. Up to the moment of the verdict being given there were but few cognizant of the name of this man, which has been traced in blood upon the escutcheon of the Confederacy. But as soon as the fate which awaited him was known, the name of Mumford was pro- nounced and blazoned forth by Northern journals as that of a traitor, and by the Southern as that of a martyr. In vain were petitions of mercy drawn up and signed by the most prominent citizens, in vain did Mrs. Butler plead upon her knees for his life. The fiat of this stern monarch had gone forth, and would not be recalled; Mumford must die, and meet the penalty of his daring. Not even when the scaffold was erected did the people believe that Butler would dare out this act of worse than Haynau atrocity. But they little knew the man until he had proved, by his countless acts of despotism, his claim to be classed amongst those whom Shakes- peare has pourtrayed so faithfully in the lines:-   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.       347 "But man, proud man, Drest in a little brief authority; Most ignorant of what he's most assured; His glossy essence-like an angry ape, Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven, As make the angels weep." On a bright and beautiful morning the sun rose for the last time to meet the gaze of the condemned prisoner, and its glorious rays illumined the cell whose portals would only open to usher him into the arms of death. Bravely, manfully, heroically, he met his doom! Tried and condemned to death, and such a death! How would he have rushed to meet it on the battle-field in Freedom's strife, in any form save this most vile and most degrading one. To the last moment he was prof- ferred life, if he would forswear his allegiance to the Confederacy; but no, he spurned the proffer at such a price, saying death had no terrors for him, and with un- blanched cheek, upon the verge of eternity, bade them do their duty, and to finish their work of cruelty and infamy. One more act-the rope was drawn, a soul was ushered into the presence of its Creator-Butler stood before the world an assassin and a murderer- while the " dew-fall of a nation's tears" consecrated the spot where Mumford, the martyr, fell a victim to fanatic hate. After large confiscations of property and beggaring thousands, General Butler prepared to leave New Orleans, having been recalled by his President, Mr. Lincoln. Prior to his departure he made the following address to his soldiers:-  &#xD;<pb n="348-349" xml:id="VAC7351-00000176"/> 348   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; "Head Quarters, Department of the Gulf, "New Orleans, Dec. 15, 1862.

WE all know how, in the communities in which we live, that there are many facts bearing upon the habits and character of public men, which in no way appear in the journals; and invariably there is an under-current of action and of interest, which, if known, would satis- factorily explain an inexplicable political combination, which the world at large never knows. But as the actors die, and the causes of reserve cease to exist, so truth is laid bare, and a future generation finds nothing concealed. The riddle is thus solved. It is almost impossible correctly to analyse the various causes, influences, and motives which, have stirred up the fearful strife. It is hard, indeed, to fancy any one, however earnest, however loyal in his connec- tions, and however deep his feelings, contemplating beforehand this four years' contest, with tits misery, its bloodshed, its hundreds of thousands of victims, its myriads of happy homes devastated, the anguish it has   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      353 caused, the innocence it has polluted. Who could find in his heart reasons to justify such a holocaust? But events grow from events, and a small matter is often the commencement of great things. The first inflammatory signal of civil war was flung upon the winds in Kansas, and with every breeze from the North it increased, until its burning breath has consumed all kindly feeling between North and South, and trodden  out every brotherly sentiment.  Who cast this brand amidst us? Who sounded the clarion note that started the fears, the passions, the furies which have their haunt amidst tfie multitude? Who guided on the ship of state to this fearful pass-this strait between Scylla, and Charybdis? Who, for all this mischief that has accrued to us in fact, and still guiltier design, is responsible? Who, but the Black Republicans? They broke in upon the peace of our country, and filled it with bayonets, angry  blood, desperate broils, confusion, and wrong. The Catalines of America wrought this work of turbulence and sedi- tion, and with torch-light processions and riotous songs are now slowly, but surely, bearing the corpse of the Union to its interment. Yes, these conspirators left no means untried to advance their schemes; and a press, venal and un- scrupulous, backed them by its pestilential influence, and in its task of devotion to the cause, paled its almost ineffectual fires before the fulminations of brimstone, which issued from the pulpits of the Beechers and the Brownlows. Ministers of the gospel, with a voca- tion only for cant and slander, thundered their anathemas against the Southern people; and fibrous old maids, 2 A  &#xD;<pb n="354-355" xml:id="VAC7351-00000179"/> 354   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; secure of self-approbation and trusting to notoriety, as a dernier resort, set up their hue and cry, and went to raising subscriptions for the purchase of Bibles, to be sent to their barbaric brethren of the South. The gaol-birds were loosed even, to fill the ranks; and Billy Wilson and Ellsworth were placed in command of men whom, to use the expression of their own commanders, it was necessary to place six feet apart, when in line of march, to prevent their picking each others' pockets. These were the braves sent to sub- due the "rebellion." These were the men sent into the heart of a lovely land to ravage and lay waste all before them; these were the men our unprotected women had to face, and these were the dastards that applied the torch to the dwellings of our gallant absent soldiers, and left our women and children without a shelter from the summer's gale or winter's storm. Yes, in Alexandria, the citizens, after the town was laid in ashes, had to shelter themselves under the boughs of the trees; and a Mrs. Texhada (whose husband had been a wealthy man, and a Louisiana State senator, ere the war), when heard of last, was seated in a go-cart, with her six little children, and with rope reins attached to a mule, was driving to General Banks' head-quarters, to beg rations for herself and little ones, while the ruins of her once happy home was still vivid in her memory. Such scenes are common to the view of our people; and the agitators of' the North are exulting, though they pretend to be overwhelmed with despair and grief. Nero-like, they now sit upon their tower, fiddling over the conflagration of their country, and singing paeans of triumph over the success of their vile project.

It is now four years since the turbulent passions of man broke loose his shackles of virtuous restraint, and wooed the demon intolerance. It is now four years since the mad fanaticism  of our Northern brethren cast the firebrand of desolation into the midst of our Southern homes, and left in the charred ruins their lasting testimonial of fiendish hate. Yes, four years of deadly contest has passed into the ocean of time, and its billows now roll over friend and foe alike. Where are now the misguided beings, on the one hand, who rushed to battle for filthy lucre? Where are now the valiant heroes, on the other, who fought for country and their firesides?

The Winifield Scott style of compliment was paid the troops, and the "rich Irish brogue," and the "sweet German accent," were made the "Faughaballach " to many a battle field of the Union. Yes, the poor deluded victims of foreign birth, by the cunning of Yankee eloquence and Yankee trickery, were marched out and placed foremost in the ranks, that should death await any, the foreigners should be the first to meet it.

I WILL now direct your attention to other scenes. You will please accompany me in fancy to New Orleans, the, theatre of those scenes. General Banks was now stationed here, and he entered upon his duties with seemingly a disposition to efface by gentle treatment the evil impression left upon the minds of the people by the despotic rule of General Butler. General Banks bore an air of mildness and suavity towards all who approached him, while his promises of protection, assist- ance, and influence were lavished on every side. The dictatorial style of his predecessor was not adopted by him, and in driving out for an airing, he could scarce be recognised from the plainest citizen. But the inhabi- tants of New Orleans soon discovered this habit of humi- lity was but the sheep's clothing to conceal the wolf, and he had not been long in the city ere he might have heard, had he listened attentively, the same compliment paid him as the tyrant of Syracuse received. Thus it runs:-"One day a  tyrant of old Syracuse overheard a  woman praying to the gods to prolong his life. He demanded of her what he had ever done for her, that she prayed thus. Frightened into sincerity, she said, 'You have done nothing for me, but the tyrant that   I reigned before your predecessor, oppressed the people   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      359 so that we prayed for his death. When'he died, the tyrant that succeeded him was worse than he had been. We prayed for his death, and the gods have sent you. Taught by the past, I see that each change of tyrants increases the common misery. Hell itself may find some even worse than you. So I pray for your life."' General Banks' principal achievement in the South was the capture of Port Hudson, General Grant having the entire honour of the surrender of Vicksburg. Both these places were strongly garrisoned, but poorly victualled; after suffering innumerable' hardships at Port Hudson, its commander, General Gardiner, surren- dered, and was sent with the famished prisoners to New Orleans. There is no eulogistic expression of sufficient. strength to give an idea of the esteem in which General Gardiner, the modern Massena, was and is held. On his arrival in New Orleans, he was sought by high and low, and the Federal officers were each day galled at the attentions which the noble captive received, who, as he promenaded the streets during his hours of liberty, clad in his sober garb of gray, was surrounded by bevies of ladies, each desirous of the honour of hi's acquaintance, as his gallant and self-sacrificing conduct had won tleir undying gratitude and admiration. General Banks stationed at Port Hudson  several coloured regiments, under command of General Andrews. Port Hudson had been fortified by the Confederates, after the attack, and though the fortification was but hastily constructed, it could have 'withstood a siege of any length had it been well supplied with provisions.

His was now a life of ease and luxury; driving to the office on a fine morning, after a late breakfast, such as the most fastidious disciple of Epicurus would feel content to partake of; residing in a confiscated mansion, with the servants and equipage of the former owner at his disposal, and treating his staff and honoured guests to sumptuous entertainments, which the unfortunate Confederates were forced to pay for. The next acts of this "most potent, grave, and reverend seignior" were his banishment of those who refused to take the -oath, and his victory over the female sex on the occasion of the departure of husbands, sons, and brothers for the "Land of Dixie." Banks is immortalised in the graphic description given of his troops, by the fair poetess Eugenie in her poem of "Le Bataille des mouchoirs," which I place before you. "E BATAILLE DES MOUCEHOIRS.

They came in hundreds-thousands lined The streets, the roofs, the shipping too, Their ribbons dancing in the wind, Their bright eyes flashing love's adieu. 'Twas then to danger we awoke, But nobly faced the unarmed throng, And beat them back with hearty stroke, Till reinforcements came along. We waited long; our aching sight Was strained in eager, anxious gaze-- At last we saw the bayonets bright Flash in the sunlight's welcome rays; The cannon's dull and heavy roll, Fell greeting on our gladdened ear- Then fired each eye, then glowed each soul, For well we knew the strife was near. Charge! rang the cry, and on we dashed Upon our female foes, As seas, in stormy fury lashed, Where'er the tempest blows. Like chaff their parasols went down, As on our gallants rushed, And many a bonnet, robe and gown, Was torn to shreds or crushed.

One startled shriek, one hollow groan, One headlong rush and then- Huzzah! the field was all our own, For we were Banks's men.

OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      363 Mrs. Banks, after this great conquest of her lord's, felt that she was losing the opportunity of getting into first class society, which she felt assured she had only to go South to enter. Thus one fine morning she arrived in the city, much to the delight of the Federal ladies, who had been awaiting her entrance into New Orleans as the signal for the season of gaiety, which theyknewwould follow. They were not disappointed. After Mrs. Banks had received several calls friom her Union friends, she gave a fete, to, which all who had called upon her were invited, as well as those who had not. Ramour says it was a most gorgeous affair: the incense or perfume which floated through the extensive salons was most delightful and agreeable to the sympathisers of the sable race, and an odour only patronised by Republicans or Abolitionists; it is distilled in Boston, in the largest quantities, and is called "L'eau d'Afrique," or essence of Africa. Mrs. Banks was attired in a blue silk dress, witl an overdress of point lace, with diamonds adorning ears, neck, and arms. She exhibited the elegant taste of being the best dressed at her own reception, thus intro- ducing to the ladies of the South a new code of etiquette. Mrs. Banks's next effort to become the leader of the 'ton' was in getting up tableaux representations qt the Opera House, in Bourbon Street. She personated the North, while several Federal ladies were surrounding the pedestal on which she stood, and kneeling in suppli- cation to her, the latter representing the Southern States. Think of it women of the South, kneeling to the North, and that represented in the person of a MASSACHUSETS FACTORY GIRL!

General Banks's fickle master at Washington was about to send him for this last defeat, to join that procession of fallen Generals who have long since passed into the gulf of oblivion, but whose shades yet wander sadly on the shores. The banner of their countrv, the faithless "Stars and Stripes," now waves over their successors, who in their turn, too, must join the ranks of those phantoms of illustrious men, who have not died, but only "gone before," to meet contempt and shame as the reward of their valour. The "Stars and Stripes" is a beautiful standard, and was given up with regret by many. The poem introduced will display the cause of its being renounced for its noble substitute the glorious STARS and BARS. STARS AND STRIPES. "O 1 there was a time, but 'twas long ago, In the days of my childhood's years, Ere the North had evoked this cloud of woe With its tempests of blood and tears- When I loved to look on the stars and stripes, On that banner waving so free, O'er the hills and vales of a happy land, And o'er many a rolling sea.

"Yes, I loved it once, I despise it now, 'Tis the ensign of fraud and wrong; And here in the presence of God and man, I recant each word of that song! Aye, that childish song, when with childhood's trust I believed the North to be true, Nor dreamed it,would seek, in its soulless lust, To defile the land to its rue. "I sang of that banner an artless song, Such as ignorant childhood sings; 'Twas childish, I know, 'but now I'm a man, I have put away childish things.' And I say to the reckless, heartless crew, Who insanely rave at the North, That your 'Union ' is dead, its requiem said, And what is its prestige worth? Worth? Scarcely the dust in which it is laid, Slain, slain by your murderous hands! And its tomb, enwreathed by the stars and stripes, In the field ' Aceldama' stands.

"Thy sails, my friend, are to me the clouds of the morning; thy ships the light of heaven, and thou thyself a pillar of fire that beams on the world by night.- Ossian. RECLINING on a pile of cushions on the deck of a blockade- runner might be seen a beautiful lady, apparelled in deep  mourning.  The bark was steadily advancing through the dense fog, and  anxiously she watched through her ivory lorgnette the course of the vessel as it glided out of the harbour of M  and pursued its perilous way through the vapour and invisible guns of the enemy's ships.  The few passengers calmly and almost breathlessly awaited the moment when they should arrive in the open sea, and thus have space to spread their canvas and to dare the foe. No fear was exhibited in the countenance of either passengers or crew, but a determination to meet the foe man to man, hand to hand, should they encounter them. On flew the fairy craft, like a frightened bird o'er the waves. First poising on a mountain billow, then sinking, seemingly, the next minute, to rise to the surface. Several hours passed thus in suspense, and then safely the bark was afloat on the deep. One long, loud, cheer for Jeff. Davis and the Southern Confederacy, and then the "Bonny Blue Flag" was sung in stirring tones.   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.     367 The passengers and crew, when this was ended, sought amusement to while away the time. The morning of the sixth day had dawned upon the voyagers, and they were just entering the salon from their respective state rooms when they were startled by a voice crying out, "The Alabama! the Alabama!"In a moment all were on deck, and straining their eyes for a glimpse of the fast approaching noted privateer. Just in front, and grimly frowning upon the little bark, loomed the dreadful " demon of the deep." Guns pro- truded from the port-holes, and the stern-looking crew seemed armed to the teeth. All was excitement on board the blockade-runner, and everyone was anxious to catch a view of Commander Semmes as he stood upon the bow of the vessel. The lady whom I mentioned as dressed in mourning, said to the Captain, as the vessel drew near the Alabama, "Sir, may I ask if we are to have the pleasure of meet- ing Captain Semmes en personne, or does he condescend to board us?" ("I think it is not his custom, lady, to leave his own vessel, though we cannot answer for his movements." "Oh, I should so like to meet him," she said, "and I may never have such another opportunity; would he think it unladylike if I should go over in the small boat? Oh! if I could but grasp his hand, and say to him how his valorous conduct is appreciated, and how the Southern people long for the moment wherein they shall bear him in triumph through their cities. Pray, Captain, permit me to enter the boat; I would dare death to feel that I had but clasped his hand!" "Certainly, lady," the old weather-beaten Captain  &#xD;<pb n="368-369" xml:id="VAC7351-00000186"/> 368   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; replied; "I will await you here until you get your hat." She disappeared, and in a moment returned, when she was placed in the dancing boat, and was soon beside the "Alabama." Commander Semmes was not a little surprised to see this lady mounting the side of the vessel, and stood politely awaiting her. The moment she placed her feet upon the deck she advanced frankly towards the Captain, saying- "Fame, Sir, has already presented you to me, and I will take the liberty of introducing to you (in the person of myself) Miss Louise Laval, who has overstepped, perhaps, the boundary of propriety in her desire to see and hear Captain Semmes." "Thanks," replied the "pirate"Captain, as he clasped both her hands within his own, while the blushes tinged his bronzed face; "thanks, dear lady, I am scarce able to reply to so complimentary a speech. I will say, however, that I am gratified for the kind ex- pressions you have honoured me in using, and would further state, you need have no fear as to the propriety of the act, as you are amongst gentlemen, and those, I feel, who appreciate your conduct, and who, if necessary, would be prepared to chastise any who might impugn your motives." "Most gallant Captain! accept my most profound acknowledgments. I have only met the reception I anticipated at the hands of yourself and brave com- panions, but come, Captain, I wish you to show me over your vessel, and to point out each gun yourself- would that I could assist in sweeping from off the ocean the fleet of our grim foe. Yours, Captain, is an   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.     369 enviable position." Captain Semmes smiled, and, accom- panied by several officers, he showed her over the vessel. She examined the works minutely, and said, as she turned to go on deck, "Oh! how glorious and trans- cendent must be the feeling when after a combat with the enemy, when victory has crowned your arms, you exclaim, as you furl your sails contentedly, 'Alabama' (Here we rest)." They had reached the side of the ship, and Miss Laval raised her hands to her neck, and, unclasping a neck- lace of exquisite pearls, said as she took the Captain's hand within her own, "Permit me, Captain Semmes, in the name of all my sex, to place upon your brow this little offering, suggestive of the crown of more unfading gems with which your brow is decked in the image of yourself, which every loyal man and woman of the South wear enshrined within their hearts." Captain Semmes bowed; she placed it over his brow; he then, smiling, took it off, and, kissing it, said, "I have met the enemy many times, Miss Laval, and met them to defeat them, but I have never had, I confess, so surprising, and yet so embarrassing, an adventure on land or sea as the present. I accept your gift in your own name and that of the lovely sex which, in yourself, is so well represented, trusting that the purity of my course, devoid of self interest, will prove me worthy of this offering." "Farewell, Captain, we may never meet again, Had I never met you I could not be a less ardent admirer than this brief personal acquaintance has made me. Farewell, Captain, once again; such men as Davis, 2 B  &#xD;<pb n="370-371" xml:id="VAC7351-00000187"/> 370   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; Semmes, Lee, Jackson, and Beauregard need not the 'painted flourish' of mine or anyone's 'praise.'" He handed her into the boat, and the "Alabama" and blockade-runner were soon parted on life's wide sea, perlhaps never to meet again; but we will follow our little bark, for it bears within its bosom much that is precious. Miss Laval promenaded the deck late on the evening of the morning of her interview with Captain Semmes, and when the stars peeped forth she was still wrapped in her shawl and Nubia, gazing upon the sea and sky, and soliloquising thus-"I am a wanderer and alone; what should I care for if not for my country? I gaze upon-the past, and down its solemn aisles I see the forms of loved ones draped in habiliments of woe, and gloom shrouds their once happy homes. I am lost in immeasurable darkness, the torch of patriotism alone lights my course or cheers the solitary Heavens!" she exclaimed, as a cannot-shot burst across the bows of the vessel. In a moment the startled passengers were on deck, and, though the Captain knew he must surrender, he steadily kept on his course through a perfect river of fire; on flew the pursued and pursuer, and with intense excitement gazed Miss Laval; at last one appalling burst boomed across the waters, and when the smoke cleared away the blockade-runner was seen in a dis- mantled and sinking state, with the crew and passengers seemingly collected, awaiting their doom. Not a word was spoken; not a cry for mercy arose upon the air, not a voice to cry "Save or we perish." Miss Laval drew forth a small Confederate flag, which had been concealed beneath the folds of her attire, and,   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      371 raising it on high, said, "Beneath this emblem none need fear death!" The waters gathered around the little barque, the pursuing ship was soon beside them, and, though the pursuers sprang on board, they could not rescue all that determined band. The boats were ready, and vainly the foe sought to persuade them to board their vessel; they coolly stood amid the rush of waters, with defiance gleaming in their eyes and scorn upon their lips. "My dear lady, place yourself under my protection," said a Federal officer, as he approached Miss Laval; "You have not a moment to lose." "Away!" she   answered; "I  scorn the succour afforded by an enemy, I will die beside my friends." ' Madam, pardon me, I shall not permit you to thus perish." Seizing her gently around the waist, he bore her per force to the side of the vessel and lowered her into the arms of the men, who awaited to receive any who might seek the boats. He returned to seek out others, and  was with his companions near perishing with the resolute crew of the blockade runner. The few females were saved, but the men preferred death to languishing in Federal dungeons. Down like a  flash almost sank the Confederate steamer, while the few whom the mercy of the enemy saved were borne to the victorious vessel. Miss Laval bore with her the banneret, and closely she pressed it to her heart, as she left the wrecked vessel and its inmates in their watery couch. "Sir," she said, "I cannot thank you for my  life; for I have suffered death in seeing my friends en- gulphed."  &#xD;<pb n="372-373" xml:id="VAC7351-00000188"/> 372   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; He bowed, and politely ushered her into the cabin, where she was most comfortably provided for. The Captain soon entered, and addressing the group of ladies who stood weeping and wringing their hands, said, "Dear ladies, permit me to say how sincerely I regret the fortune of war which has placed both yourselves and me in so painful a position. I shall, however, do all I can to mitigate your troubles, and will send you to your various homes at the earliest convenience, or land you at any port you may wish to enter." Miss Laval being the only one who could command her voice, said, "If you will but send us to Havre, you will be acting in accordance with the desire of one and all." "You shall, ladies, be sent upon the first vessel bound for Havre, and in the meantime I will exert myself, as well as all my officers, to make you comfort-. able." He kept his word. The ladies were placed upon a vessel, and not many days elapsed, ere the following note was received by a Confederate Commissioner:-- [ "Paris, Rue Chaussee d'Antin. Sir,--I send by the bearer of this note a package; it contains a black Irish poplin dress. You will doubtless deem this a strange gift, yet if you will rip the seams you will discover that the cord is valuable, and only manufactured in' Richmond on the James,' and used for tying up Government documents. The buttons are large, and if uncovered will 'a tale unfold.' Should you find it serve you, retain it as a model, but if you should   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      373 design any improvement on the style, I will take pleasure in bearing a specimen of your model for Gabrielles to Richmond, which I may safely have patented. "Hoping for an early response, "I am, respectfully, (Signed)     "OUISE LAVAL." It is needless to state the Commissioner's surprise, when on taking out the cord it proved to be despatches on diplomatised paper, and rolled as cord and covered as such. The buttons each bore one word, and when placed all together, formed quite a long despatch. In wonder the Commissioner gazed upon this dress-at the wit which could have conceived this plan of artifice. Miss Laval had worn this dress, changing neither night or day during the voyage. She feigned her desire to perish, and had the Federal officer known that in his arms was held a contraband parcel, he would doubtless have left it on board the wreck. In a few days Miss Laval was again attired in the black Irish poplin gabrielle, and on her way to Rich- mond, where I will introduce you to her in an interview with the noble President, Jefferson Davis. The room in which Miss Lavall sat awaiting the President, was furnished with Cretan simplicity. No glare of sunlight illumined gilding or fresco, but papers, books, maps, and designs were scattered over the plain tables, "etageres," &amp;c., which filled the room.  Miss Laval was gazing intently on a portrait; when a step fell upon her ear. She turned, and met the kindly beaming but worn face of the President, who said, as he warmly grasped her hand,  &#xD;<pb n="374-375" xml:id="VAC7351-00000189"/> 374   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; "Welcome! thrice welcome to these halls once again; their echoes, Miss Laval, can never be awakened by truer voice. than thine." "Thanks" she answered, 'smiling; "feeling the sin- cerity, and being conscious myself of the truth of your speech, I will not accuse you of gallantry. Yes, I am true to my country. I feel there can be no doubt of this, with my weak ability true as yourself. The mind, the power, the vast erudition of the President is greater, but his energy is not superior to Miss Laval's. I have returned after a successful mission to Europe, and now I stand ready and willing to serve my country or its ruler, should either choose to honour me again. Would, Sir, that I had eloquence sufficient to utter the just eulogies which everywhere in Europe I have heard lavished upon my country and its wise and renowned President. Would that I could have borne these foreign, priceless gems of rich and rare value in a proper casket to present you; but they come to you not the less pure in a Confederate case of rude workmanship, but honest and firm setting. The sleepless nights, the long, long weary hours by day that you have spent in planning, reasoning, counselling, are each numbered in golden sheen upon the rec9rd of Fame." "Lady, I am gratified for your generous appreciation, and feel that I am indebted to many from your report of my character abroad. I serve my country and her people, however, with no desire or expectation of reward, yet I must say it is refreshing to feel that our motives are understood, and that such men as Lee and Jackson have, as warriors and men, entitled themselves to rank amongst those whom Fisher Ames would call great, when he   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      375 says, "The most substantial glory of a country is in its virtuous great men; its prosperity will' depend on its docility to learn from their example; that nation is fated to ignominy and servitude for which such men have lived in vain. Power may be seized by a nation that is yet barbarous, and wealth may be enjoyed by one that it finds or renders sordid. The one is the gift and sport of accident, and the other is the gift and sport of power. Both are mutable, and have passed away without leav- ing behind them any other memorial than ruins that offend taste, and traditions that baffle conjecture." Good and noble actions, lady, strike an everlasting root, and leave perennial blossoms on the grave. Man should not consider self; our men have been regardless of their lives, their fortunes, their all, in the great endeavour to promote the interest of their country. I have much to be thankful for, Miss Laval, for if success has thus far crowned my efforts, I owe much of it to Messrs. Benjamin Stephens, Yancey, and such like, on the one hand; while in the field, Lee, Beauregard, Jackson, Hardee, Taylor, Stewart, and others too numerous for mention, have made the sword finish all the pen or tongue was incapable of executing." "Had we, Sir, a less sage President," Miss Laval replied, "I fear we would, ere this, have had a disgrace- ful compromise, which I feel assured will never be listened to by you." "Not for a moment, lady, trust me. We have sacri- ficed too many of our best and bravest; we have been called to witness the devastation of our homes; we have felt the sting of their vile pens where they have pre- sumed to caricature our ragged and worn troops.

"I am glad to hear you speak thus; I knew I was not deceived in my ideas of your intentions, and may God grant thee and thy countrymen heart and nerve to bide the issue.

This fact, David Strother, your chief of staff, could have told you. The house was built by my father, a revolutionary soldier, who served the whole seven years for your indepen- dence.  There was I born; there the sacred dead repose; it was my house and my home; and there has your niece, who lived among us during this horrid war, up to the present moment, met with every kindness and hospitality at my hands. "Was it for this that you turned me, my young daughter, and little son out upon the world without a shelter? or was it because my husband is the grandson of the revolutionary patriot, and of the noblest of Christian warriors, the greatest of generals, Robert E.

"In the case of Mr. A. R. Boteler, both father and mother were far away. Any heart but that of Captain Martindale (and yours) would have been touched by that little circle, comprising a widowed daughter, just risen from her bed of illness, her three little fatherless babies, the eldest not five years old, and her heroic sister. I repeat that any man would have been touched at that sight but Captain Martindale; one might as well hope to find mercy and feeling in the heart of a wolf, bent on its prey of young lambs, as to search for such qualities in his bosom.

These women seem to have tacitly accepted the fact that, until the war is over, courtship is a mockery that had better not be thought of. "The maiden who says good-bye to her lover makes up her mind for the worst that can befall. Death is the rival of love; and death, nine times out of ten, is con- queror. Is it strange, then, that we who seek for ten- derness in the hearts of these women must seelk deep? Wrong as is the cause, it has a more wide-spread, and a bitterer, deeper devotion among the masses in this region than has ours. One of the most beautiful of any women in the valley, who visited the North before the war, and was a belle at several watering-places during the summer months, refused last week to take the hand of an old friend, in Federal uniform, who presented him- self at her door.

I believe they meant what they said, and would abide by it to the letter. Such women as these are influential enemies, and it will be said by many that they deserve all the insult and harm they have received in return for their enmity. I do not think so, and, far as I am from defending their devotion to a cause wicked in its inception, I cannot refrain from as much wonder as admiration of the few among the many in the valley who preserve a like devo- tion to the sacred cause of the Union. "One incident will always be grateful and thrilling in the memory of this army. While the troops were passing through Winchester, on their return, three young and accomplished ladies, wearing the colours of our flag upon their breasts, and waving the same banner borne by the marching regiments, stood in front i of a single dwelling, smiling welcome. To the officers who stopped to greet them they expressed a heartfelt joy aftthe presence of our soldiers, and to those officers they bade farewell with trembling voices, and eyes swimming in regretful tears."

Has it destroyed that courtesy and those delicate atten. tions towards ladies for which our country was once so justly famed? It would seem, indeed, that our instincts were changed, and that our sense of propriety had worn itself out. "The tale I will now tell does not seem to appertain to an order of things apparently possible in the nine- teenth century, and yet I vouch that it is not taken from the history of the Goths, Vandals, or Saracens. The whole is modern history; not that of the middle ages, but of yesterday. The hero is an officer of volun- teers, a captain, a provost-marshal, and not one of Attila, Totila, or Tamerlane's savage  hordes. The heroine is a pretty girl of seventeen, of French descent, a sweet, a lovely Creole. "There you have, Mr. Editor, the ' dramatis personae.'

He did not succeed in the attempt, but he pushed her against the wall. A second time he made an effort to throw her, when she, taking hold of his long beard, fell upon his breast. She clung to that beard with all the desperate energy of an offended female. There were present at that hideous scuffle Leontia's venerable grandmother and little Ondine; her mother is in the grave, her father was not at home-he is far away, he will come. "The maddened provost, now bearded, seized her wrists, tearing her skin with his nails, shaking her whole  frame with all his power, while she, having become frantic with pain, convulsed with indignation, clings to his whiskers and beard, tearing both away.

There is no flag of truce sent from  , one belligerent to the other; they are still face to face, but panting, bleeding, choked with pain and madness, in the presence of the witnesses whom his roaring, the cries of the children, and the loud supplication of thej grandmother have caused to assemble. The Captain asks for quarter; he proposes terms to her who is nearly fainting, but whose indomitable courage bears up against the weakness of her sex. "He capitulates, 'Please, miss, let my beard go!' She at first says nothing, but continues to hold on firmly. 'If I let your arms go will you let my beard go?' ' Yes,' she answers. ," Well, then let my beard go.' "'No, let my arms free first.' "Then he released her. He can look on what he has left behind, "'stroy'd in dishonour," scattered on the floor, and hanging to those delicate fingers which an iron will has made terrible; he maddens at the sight; it is a whole wreck of his manhood around him. But he dares not return to the charge; there stands before  him that pretty girl of seventeen, with her large beautiful black eyes, her dark tresses, her delicate features of the deepest crimson. All her blood seems to have rushed to her heart to make it stout, and to her face, returning to render her more lovely. There she stands, mute, bidding defiance.

And then, coming nearer to her and holding a handful of that hair which had been his beard, he piteously said, ' What must I do with it ?'

Hear! hear! he spake first of Julienne, the servant-girl, stating that she had been cruelly treated by Miss Bordis. To this statement Leontia gave an indignant denial. There was contempt enough in her curved lip to crush an ordinary man, but not enough for a captain of volunteers; there was a flash of indig- nation in her eyes-erect, she was beautifully scornful. The judge dropped the nigger, and his beard was the next charge. Some has been saved, it is true; he has it in his pocket; but there is no salve that will remedy the evil.

While sacred music floats upon the air, The mournful cortege wends its way along Through myrtle groves, while feathered warblers waking Blend with the chant their melancholy song. The grove is reached! the last sad notes are over, The requiem fades upon the morning air! They strew bright blossoms on the earth above her, And leave her, while they breathe a silent prayer. No cypress tree above her couch is waving, But palm and date trees shade her lonely grave, While glancing sunbeams, and the bright stars shining, Keep quiet vigil by the amber wave. "Be just and fear not." AGAIN we turn to New Orleans to witness a mournful spectacle, one in its solemnity, sublimely grand. The bells are pealing the funeral knell of one of Louisiana's fairest and best beloved daughters, and we behold in front of her residence, corner of Rampart and Esplanade Streets, the sympathising multitude, who have assembled from humble cottages and stately homes to catch a glimpse of the coffin, in which the mortal remains of Marguerite Caroline Deslonde, wife of General G. T. Beauregard, are  enshrined.  Hushed  and  respectful stand the vast multitude. A stifled sob arises at inter- vals, but breaks softly on the rock of despotism, which   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.       395 it struggles against. The voice of the petty tyrant has proclaimed that she may be borne to her last resting place, in the parish of Saint John Baptist, "provided there be no demonstration." The procession of priests in their robes, with Bishop Odin at the head; the array of youth and age; the sad regard that each face wears, the silent tear coursing down the cheek; the flower- covered streets which lead from her mansion to where the steamer lay; the almost audible beating of hearts as the burial casket comes in view of the multitude on its bed of lilies, roses, and orange blossoms; the bowed heads of the awe-inspired thousands; the whispered prayer of the vast throng-is demonstration, such as no tyrant can suppress, and beyond the power of language to pourtray. Only sixty persons are allowed to act as escort to the body, and Marguerite Caroline Deslonde, the honoured, noble wife of G. T. Beauregard, is soon borne down the river to the plantation, where, after an imposing service, she is left in quiet peace, alike uncon- scious of homage or of insult. General Banks would scarcely have granted the request, to convey her body to the plantation, nor would he have placed his own steamer, the "Nebraska," at the disposal of her family, had not the organ through which he breathes his true sentiments, betrayed his inhuman and indelicate feelings, when it published the following brutal announcement of Mrs. Beauregard's death:- "The morning papers announce the death of the wife of G.

He also swore at one time to support the consti- tution of the United States. He does not hold his oath in very high estimation, as we find him not only plotting for the destruction of his country, but deserting his invalid wife for years together, and leaving her depend- ant upon others for those acts of kindness and support that should be given by a husband. We know very little of the life or character of the deceased, further than that she was an invalid, neglected by her sworn protector, and left by him under the powerful protection of the flag whose glory he is devoting his puny energies to sully. But when he is called to his final account, he will have the mortification of knowing that the lustre of the Stars and Stripes is all the brighter, and his betrayed country the more powerful, for the treason of himself and co-conspirators." The intense excitement caused by this article filled General Banks's soul with dread, and in order, after a fashion, to make some show of manliness, he permitted a public funeral. This was poor atonement for the base insult, and the scowl which rested upon the brow of Southerners, as they read "this woman," told of a deeper thrust of the poignard of outrage than the famous article No. 28, of General-Butler-notoriety, which only pointed to "women styling themselves ladies," and whose conduct in the public thoroughfares deserved reproach. "This woman" was applied to a lady, born and bred such. One whose position during her whole life was exalted, and whose career from the cradle to the grave   was one of virtue and unparalleled excellence. Not content with casting a slur upon the dead, he has pre- sumed in this article to asperse the character of the noble Beauregard, whose attachment to his wife is well known. Yes, in the silent face of the dead has this vile loathsome wretch dared to utter falsehood. General Banks did not even require his mouthpiece to apologise. How different did General Butler act, when upon his arrival in New Orleans, he heard that Mrs. Beauregard was ill. He sent for Mr. Sauve, and said to him, "I learn that Mrs. Beauregard is quite ill-not expected to live; if this be the case, and she desires an interview with her husband, he may enter the city, unmolested, I shall not see it." It was said that General Beauregard did visit Mrs. Beauregard, but I can only vouch for the conduct of General Butler, as related by an intimate friend of General Beauregard. General Butler again evinced charitable feeling upon an occasion which it may not be inappropriate to mention here. I had been staying some few weeks at the Ursuline Convent, and it was during the dearth of provisions (flour especially), when Generals Butler and Shepley monopolised the purchase and sale. One of the nuns (the Mother Assistant) said th me, "From what I have heard you say regarding your interviews with Generals Butler and Shepley, they may allow us, at your request, to purchase flour, for if they do not we shall have to discharge our scholars, retaining only our orphans, whom we are forced to keep. We cannot get provisions, and are nearly out."

I was received most courteously, but was refused the pass unless I would take the oath of allegiance to the United States, which I refused most positively to do. Upon rising to leave, I mentioned briefly my conversa- tion with the Mother Assistant of the Ursuline Convent. "When did this occur, Miss?" he said. I responded, "Last week." "Then present my compliments to the Superior, and say to her, that if she will make out a list of what pro- visions she requires, I will fill it with pleasure with or without money." I forthwith bore the message, and was told by Sister St. Michel that they had that day been fortunate enough to make a purchase at auction of all they would need for some time. I wrote the General a note of thanks, in the name of the ladies, saying that they would be most happy to accept his proffer should a dearth occur again. I write this from my personal experience, and to prove to the world that there is a difference between " to seem" and "to be."  I was detained in New Orleans after its occupation, for five months, and though I was granted every favour which I condescended to ask of either Generals Butler or Shepley, I was thus put to many inconveniences, but at last made my escape, with a pass penned by General Butler himself, for a Miss "Jane Florence," which he gave to a lady who had taken the oath for a per- son whom he deemed her protdgd, as the individual led him to suppose.

General Butler did many acts while in New Orleans, for which he has just claims on the regard of some of the first families; in fact the elite of the city in many instances wrote him letters, in tdhfich were expressed the most unbounded admiration and esteem. Mrs. Slocum of New Orleans, wound up her epistle of grateful acknowledgments (for his protection of her property) by a sentence which speaks volumes for Butler, while it reflects no credit upon her as a Confederate and Southerner, whose son was then in the Confederate States Army.   She concluded, 1' Your magnanimity can only be equalled by the cowardice of the men of New Orleans."

Miss de Villerie was chosen to present the colours; and in military style, in front of the President's man- sion, and in presence of the entire population, Miss de Villerie, at the appointed hour, escorted by a corps of ladies, attired in grey, and mounted, like herself, on magnificent steeds, and wearing the military chapeau, proceeded to the place of rendezvous. Arrayed in thread-bare uniforms, and mounted upon war-worn steeds, awaited the generals and military men, and when Miss de Villerie appeared, a cheer of enthusiastic greeting arose and rent the air; an avenue at the same time opening through the dense throng to admit the cavalcade. General Beaumont was seated beside the President, in an open landau, drawn by four magnificent grey chargers. Miss de Villerie, joined by General S   (who bore the banner), advanced towards the equipage and stopped immediately in front, a burst of applause startling the echoes of city, hill, and dale. When silence reigned, she spoke in clear tones; address- ing a few appropriate remarks to the General, expressive of the appreciation of the Southern people for his ser- vices, so nobly, gallantly rendered, and placing her hand upon the flag-staff, she said, in conclusion, "Accept this tribute of a bleeding nation's esteem, hallowed as 2 D  &#xD;<pb n="402-403" xml:id="VAC7351-00000203"/> 402   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; its folds are by the tears of mothers, wives, and sisters, and consecrated to the cause of Truth and Justice."

Miss de Villerie passed through this scene in dreamy abstractedness; her pale cheek, firom which the roses had long since fled, bespeaking suffering such as only those who have seen their brightest highest, hopes perish, and have witnessed the entombing even of their best and firmest trust, can feel.

Not that I received your country's homage and witnessed its gratitude, but because God should have so ordained it that the offering should be made by Natalie De Villerie, the only being I ever loved;," at the same time throwing off the light wig and whiskers he stood before Miss De Villerie's astonished gaze the veritable Count Beauhar- nais, he continued, "Natalie, do you not know me? Do you not feel me at last worthy of your love? I who have so long, so ardently hoped and prayed for this moment when your country would have acknowledged me worthy its lovely daughter. Speak, Natalie; tell me I have not loved in vain."   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.      405 Miss De Villerie trembled with emotion at this denouement, she clasped her hands to her forehead as it were to shut out some vision; gradually her head sunk upon her breast-he approached her, she waived him off, but he knelt before her, saying, "forgive me, Natalie, if my expressions of a feeling which overpowers me pain you. tI know your heart and read its story long ago, and none, save love pure as mine, could have wor- shipped you, even when you held the cold lifeless form of another pressed to your heart, and prayed for your happiness while you kissed another's lips. Natalie, nought but love, enduring as Time could have recog- nised under the various forms and disguises of Miss Clayton, Soeur Secessia, and Miss Laval, the beautiful Natalie De Villerie. I have traced you everywhere; I have followed on faithfully; I know your suffering, I respect it; but, Natalie, endeavour to forget, and trust to my love for future happiness.", She answered through her tears, "Happiness, Count! Alas, there is none for me in this world. My heart is in the grave. I speak thus, as you seem to know all. I never loved but once-can never love again. You ask me to be yours; would you care to wed with one between whose love and yours would hang a funeral pall? Would you wish to place the firm founda- tion of such a structure as love has reared in your noble heart upon a quagmire in which it would, sink to rise no more? Do you desire to place golden drapery on the windows of a ruin where the mildew of cold and damp shall gather? No! no! I cannot consent to a deed of sacrilege." "Natalie, I will not urge the matter, nor say more  &#xD;<pb n="406-407" xml:id="VAC7351-00000205"/> 406   THE HEROINE OF THE CONFEDERACY; at present. You have termed your heart a ruin, it is, nevertheless, dear to me. I will rebuild its broken arches, I will on the adamantine base of my own rear again its fallen columns of beauty, and on the pinnacle of this edifice inscribe my motto,- Nil desperandum.' Farewell." Respectfully he raised her hand, and pressing it to his lips arose and left the apartment.  Again the tide of bitter memories rose and fell, and once again she was called upon for a sacrifice. The morning passed away in tears and reflection, and when evening fell she wrote thus:- "Count Beauharnais,-If the gratitude and esteem of one whose love dwells with the dead are deemed a sufficient recompense for your long and faithful service to my country, and your unwavering devotion to me, I consent to be yours; trusting that if I cannot be happy myself, I shall thus render happy one who is worthy of a purer and more profound affection than I can ever give him. "Give me but until the end of this unhappy strife, and by that time, perhaps, the feeling which now seems perjury to the dead will have somewhat lessened, and I shall be more fit to vow fealty as your bride, and more strengthened in the idea of the duty I owe towards the living as well as the dead. The heart, withered and crushed, could never be revived by a less noble or ardent love than that of a Beauharnais; this name alone is worthy the heart's first offering, which, alas! it is not mine to yield. "Farewell! Rest content with my promise; if God   OR, TRUTH AND JUSTICE.   '     407  so ordains it, it will be fulfilled. Until then we are, before the world and to each other, but as friends. "NATALIE DE VILLERIE." Reader, I feel you would fain know more. Would that I might rise the dim veil of futurity, and take your hand in mine, and, pressing it to my lips, say farewell to her and thee, as I pointed to a happy home, environed by all which is bright and beautiful. ' Shut out by Alpine hills from the rude world, Near a clear lake, margined by fruits of gold And whispering myrtles; glassing softest skies, As cloudless, save with rare and roseate shadows, As we would have her fate!" ROSALE PLANTATION. 1865. "The steed is vanished from the stall; No serf is seen in Hassan's hall; The lonely spider's thin grey pall Waves slowly widening o'er the wall: The bat builds in his harem bower, And in the fortress of his power, The owl usurps the beacon-tower; The wild dog howls o'er the fountain's brim With baffled thirst, and famine grim ; For the stream has shrunk from its marble bed, Where the weeds and the desolate dust are spread." The once beautifully cultivated fields are overgrown with nettles, and the fences are torn down; the slaves are no longer to be heard by the traveller, at morn or at eve,. singing their songs of merry, innocent glee; the charred ruins of their once pretty cottages are seen, and the cattle even are no more heard, nor tinkling bells of sheep greet the ear, while within all speaks of ruin   &#xD;<pb n="408-409" xml:id="VAC7351-00000206"/> 408   THE HEROINE' OF THE CONFEDERACY; and decay. The shrubs are withered and uncared for, the parterres are weed-grown, and reptiles lurk beneath; now and then a shattered marble rises amidst the rank grass and brambles, to speak of some spent shell aimed at an imaginary guerilla; the places where statues once stood are now but the resting-place of the couchant in- vader on sentinel duty; the fountains are fissured and broken, and their once clear streams are now a sanguine hue; the birds, even, have flown to sunnier scenes, and warble their strains amidst gayer foliage; the chateau is in a state of dilapidation, and the mournful winds sweep through its open casements, wailing for the dead, and absent; the floor is strewn with pieces of marble of exquisite workmanslip, while the fresco work of walls and ceilings is covered with ruin, and insects are creep- ing over all; the bat flaps his dark wings in the upper chambers; and the dove alone remains to moan in piteous strains o'er DESOLATION'S TABLEAUX!!!    &#xD;</p>
