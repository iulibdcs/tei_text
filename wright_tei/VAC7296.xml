                  <p>"DEAR brother, do leave your pencils and your palette, and come forth upon the terrace with me and see the glorious sunset."</p>
                  <p>These words were addressed by a beautiful girl to a person, who, though still young, was many years her elder, and who, clad in a dark velvet tunic and wearing a cap of the same material, sat before an easel in a darkened apartment, busily engaged in the completion of a female head of exquisite loveliness. The earnest speaker, though a daughter of Italy, had not the dark eyes and hair and the deep complexion that usually characterize her countrywomen. On the contrary, her skin was white and transparent as the marble of Carrara, her eyes light blue, and her hair flowing in waves of gold over her shoulders. It was the Saxon type of beauty. Still her figure, though she could scarcely have seen eighteen summers, had that full and early development which only belongs to the daughters of the south. Her brother, though resembling her somewhat, had the true national stamp in the manly beauty of his face. His hair was black as a midnight wave and escaped from his cap in broad statuesque curls; his eyes were dark and lustrous, his complexion very dark, and his features pure in outline, though bold and striking. His figure, as he rose to his feet, and laid aside the implements of his calling or amusement, appeared tall and well moulded, and there was something almost regal in the grace of his attitude and movement.</p>
                  <p>"You are ever my dear, judicious monitress," he replied, with a smile. "It is getting too dark to paint, and I am afraid my last touches have rather injured my performance. What say you, Estella?"</p>
                  <p>"You never do anything amiss, Giulio," answered the fond girl, "and I see nothing but perfection in that lovely face. But you have never told me the subject. Is it a Madonna? The meek expression—the soft, pitying purity of those eyes—would make me think so, and yet the dress is almost of our times."</p>
                  <p>"It is not a Madonna," replied Giulio, with a half sigh.</p>
                  <p>"Who is it then? There is a strange fascination in the face. Is it a dream or a memory?"</p>
                  <p>"It is painted from recollection."</p>
                  <p>"Then, brother, sometime you shall show me the original."</p>
                  <p>"You will never see her on earth, Estella," said the painter, sadly, as he drew a curtain before his picture, after a last, lingering gaze at his handiwork. "But come—or we shall lose the golden glory of the sunset."</p>
                  <p>The brother and sister left the apartment, descended a stairway, and stood upon the highest terrace of the villa of Monte Rosa. It was an old edifice with two square towers built of stone,<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC7296-00000003"/> and perched upon a little plateau, near the summit of a considerable elevation of land, and facing the south. Behind it rose a dark forest that crowned the mountain. Before it, terrace on terrace, planted with fruit trees, with vines and flowering shrubs, with here and there a white vase gleaming among the shrubbery, the territory descended, till the garden merged in a wide tract devoted to agriculture, and far down in the valley was seen a cluster of peasants' cottages, reflected in the river that flowed through it, while the land again rose abruptly and wooded on the other side of the valley, nearly to the height of Monte Rosa. From the latter, a brawling torrent, affluent in numerous springs, descended to meet the river in many a turbulent cascade, crossed here and there by rustic bridges, built rather for ornament than use, for the stream was but a single pace in breadth. The whole scene was suffused now in the matchless glow of an Italian sunset, which burned in the west in cloudless glory, bronzed the heavy woods and feathery shrubs, and made the mountain torrent and the river in the valley glow like streams of molten gold.</p>
                  <p>"Estella," said the young man, after they had both gazed for some moments in silent admiration on the scene, "how poorly does a scene like this make us think of art! How impossible it is for the pencil and the colors to counterfeit glories like those before us! The world is enraptured at the master's landscape—but he himself feels how far short he falls of the original, and blushes at the praises of his skill."</p>
                  <p>"And yet you devote many hours to your art, brother."</p>
                  <p>"Yes—I require variety of occupation. I cannot always be in the fields, superintending my laborers, nor in the forest hunting the boar, nor in the plain flying my hawk. I should find time hang heavy at those seasons when the weather confines me within doors, were it not for some such pursuit."</p>
                  <p>"Yes—you would soon tire of my poor company," said the girl, reproachfully.</p>
                  <p>"Never, dearest Estella," replied the young man, "never, unless I were weary of myself—and Heaven knows that happens frequently enough."</p>
                  <p>"Then you must have some secret grief, Giulio, that you have never imparted to me. I confide all my thoughts to you—but you—you are moody and abstracted oftentimes. Surely you are not poor?"</p>
                  <p>"Poverty is one of the lighter ills we have to contend with. No, Estella, I—rather we—have broad and productive lands, that my skill has increased tenfold in value since I came into possession of them; my peasants are industrious, contented, and love me; there is a bit of forest, where, on my own soil, I can hunt the wild boar, and none to forbid the ringing of my bugle and the footfall of my steed."</p>
                  <p>"Why, we are rich, brother!"</p>
                  <p>"Wealth is comparative, Estella. If I look below me, I am rich indeed; if above me, I am poor."</p>
                  <p>"Then why not look below?" asked Estella.</p>
                  <p>"Because I come of a race trained like the eagles, to look upward—not to the lowly valley with its miserable peasants' huts—but to the mountain height crowned with feudal battlements, over which the silken banner blazoned with arms in gold embroidery flaps defiance at the foe."</p>
                  <p>"I, too, have been taught to look upward," said Estella, meekly; "but I look beyond the battlement and banner, and see only the serene smile of heaven itself."</p>
                  <p>At that instant the sound of a convent bell from the valley far below them, stole upward like a prayer. Both of the listeners bowed to its influence, and side by side they kneeled and prayed. When their devotions were ended, Giulio led his sister to a seat, and then said:</p>
                  <p>"You questioned me just now about yon picture—Estella, it is the image of your mother. Who scarcely saw you, sister," continued the young man, with emotion. "The date of your birth was that of her death. She but pressed her wan lips to yours, gave you to our father's arms and died."</p>
                  <p>"And our father?"</p>
                  <p>"He followed our sainted mother to the grave in a few weeks, broken-hearted. His last request was that you might be educated in the convent of Our Lady of Mercy. At the age of sixteen you were to decide whether you would come out into a world so full of trouble, or pass the remainder of your life with the peaceful sisters. I need not say with what joy I learned that you wished to abandon your life of seclusion, and with what delight I welcomed to the walls of Monte Rosa, as its mistress, so charming a companion."</p>
                  <p>"And it may please you to know that your little sister is perfectly happy here, Giulio."</p>
                  <p>"Perfectly?"</p>
                  <p>"Except when I see a shadow on your brow, brother. But you have only told me half your tale. Your skill has produced on canvass an image of our mother—so that I already know her features by heart—you must paint our father one day, but in the meanwhile, tell me what manner of man he was."</p>
                  <p>"He was taller than I am, Estella, and erect as a standard staff. As I remember him, his close cut curls were black with threads of silver. Splendor of attire well became the elegance of his person—but to my eyes he never looked so glorious as when he was sheathed in steel from head to foot, and reined with a light hand the barbed steed that curvetted beneath his weight."</p>
                  <p>"Then he was a soldier?"</p>
                  <p>"Ay—Estella, and a leader of soldiers—while I—I only command a few peaceful peasants, and perform no higher achievement than couching my spear against the spring of a wild boar."</p>
                  <p>"Is war the only pursuit worthy of man's attention, brother?" asked Estella, reproachfully.</p>
                  <p>"No, dearest, there are other spheres worthy of ambition. There is the council chamber. Is it not something to manage the affairs of a wide territory—to develop the resources of numerous subjects—to foil the cunning of neighboring potentates—to make wise laws, and, what is more, to enforce them? I administer a little estate—my father ruled over a wide domain: I am lord of Monte Rosa—my father was duke of Parma."</p>
                  <p>"Our father is dead—why are not you duke of Parma?"</p>
                  <p>"Because a villain has stolen my right, Estella; because the Parmese ducal coronet rests on the brows of an usurper."</p>
                  <p>"And that usurper?"</p>
                  <p>"Francisco Veroni—our father's brother, our uncle, a man that our poor father loaded with favors, with whom he shared his heart and purse, his table and his palace. It were long to tell you, Estella, how, even during the life of our father, that bold, bad man tampered with the people and the troops—how the odium of every severed measure was made to rest upon our father's shoulders, the merit of every favor claimed by this man. You cannot yet understand the wiles and machinations and treacheries of bad men. Here it is needless that you should do so—did we enjoy our rights it would become you to study them."</p>
                  <p>"Then I thank Heaven I am not princess of Parma," said Estella, fervently.</p>
                  <p>"Hush! hush! Estella. Do not tell me that now I have given you a glimpse at the glories from which we have fallen, you are content to lead this ignoble life here."</p>
                  <p>"I have known no other. Let me enjoy it. And now that I have the secret of your unrest, dear brother, let me conjure you to lay aside all thoughts of your wrongs and the evil deeds of others, and adapt yourself to your present condition."</p>
                  <p>"I have essayed to do so," replied Giulio. "And since you came hither, I thought I had succeeded, and that Giulio Brigaldi—for my ancestral name, even, was denied me—the painter, farmer, vine-dresser, hunter and student, might be quite as happy a man as the wearer of the ducal coronet of Parma. But I am afraid I have deceived myself—a single spark sufflees to kindle the pride of birth and fire of ambition. I am ready to gnaw my heart out like a prisoned wolf—and you know I <emph>am</emph> a prisoner, Estella."</p>
                  <p>"How so, dear brother?"</p>
                  <p>"The usurper assigned me this domain, banishing me from his court, and forbidding me to enter a foreign service. Hence the glorious career of arms and the equally glorious career of diplomacy are closed against me. I must vegetate here, within a brief ride of his capital, so that if I show the slightest symptom of rebellion, his bravoes can surround me and make me prisoner. Malediction! what a defence I could make here, if my peasants had not hearts of hares. I could easily turn the parapet of the villa into battlements and plant them with culverins, loop-hole the walls for musketry, have a store of rocks to roll down on the invaders, and then, if it came to the worst, and they overcame my defence, it would be but a match to the magazine, and goodby to Monte Rosa."</p>
                  <p>"O, pray, brother!" said Estella, "do not abandon yourself to these wild fancies. Do not try to fancy you are unhappy here—and if you dwell on the usurpation, remember that in its own good time Heaven punishes the wicked and rewards the good. We have many blessings, if we do not have power—let us enjoy them."</p>
                  <p>"You are right, dear sister," said Giulio, "and I stand rebuked. My wild fit has passed, and my ordinary philosophical mood returned I <emph>was</emph> ungrateful—I am no longer so. But the mists are rising from the valley, and there is a chill in the air. Go in. Blame me not if my bugle breaks your slumbers at an early hour tomorrow. I am bound for the chase."</p>

                  <head type="sub">BEHIND THE CURTAIN.—THE DUKE AND THE EQUERRY.</head>
                  <p>FROM country to city, from the villa to the palace—let us hasten on the swift wings of fancy. At sunset we stood upon the slope of Monte Rosa: the night has passed—morning, bright, dewy and effulgent, has dawned upon the earth, and we have now passed the threshold of the most closely-guarded apartment of all Parma—the cabinet of its duke. In the hall without, halberdiers are pacing to and fro: night and day they keep watch and ward over the repose of their sovereign lord. In that hall, from nightfall to day-dawn torches blaze in their sockets, throwing their ruddy glare upon steel corslets and gleaming pikes. When the prince goes forth, it is between walls of steel—troops line the streets when he rides abroad. And when he goes to church, clad in the silken and velvet robes of his rank, and wearing, to the popular eye, a serene and smiling aspect, next to his heart he wears a coat of Milan steel, curiously fashioned by a cunning artificer, and so finely wrought and tempered as to turn the point of an assassin's dagger, should any impious hand be raised against the life of the Lord's anointed. And Francisco Veroni, duke of Parma, sees that hand raised at every moment of his life—for the imagination of an unjust man is ever haunted by spectres. Guilt is constantly conjuring up the phantom of retribution. Sumptuous is the fare beneath the weight of which his table groans: yet fears he that death lurks in the tempting viands spread before him; so that of no dish dares he partake until his chamberlain has first eaten of its contents. Yet he has for some years enjoyed his usurped authority unchallenged. No attempt upon his life has yet been made. His brother's son lives in exile, and no powerful friends have raised their voices in his behalf. Why then, should not Duke Francisco eat, drink and be merry? Because for the criminal there is no real enjoyment, because the worm that never dies cannot be quieted by music, by feasting, by wine, by pomp or luxury.</p>
                  <p>But let us pass the threshold of his cabinet. It is sumptuously furnished: hangings of crimson velvet with gold bullion fringes swing from the gilded cornice to the floor, curiously wrought in mosaic of many colored and perfumed woods. Against this dark background stand, on richly carved pedestals, beautiful statues of snowy marble, some the handiwork of modern artists, others the work of those immortal Greek sculptors whose skill has never yet been equalled. The daylight streams in many colors through a high window of stained glass: the furniture is richly carved and gilded; every article is costly and tasteful.</p>
                  <p>In a richly carved chair, beneath a splendid canopy, sat a man past the middle age, attired in a robe of purple velvet richly embroidered with gold, one hand resting on the arm of his chair, the other playing with the chased hilt of a dagger. The long locks that escaped from his velvet cap were thickly threaded with gray, yet there was nothing venerable in his aspect. He was approaching the confines of age, without deriving from years that dignity which commands reverential homage. His features were regular and even noble, yet there was a sinister expression in the mouth and eye, a mingled sensuality and cruelty which chilled and repelled the observer without awing him. His dark eyes rolled restlessly in their orbits, and there was an habitual contraction of the brows which indicated physical or mental pain.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of Parma was not alone. Standing before him in an attitude of respectful deference, was a young man of fine figure and handsome countenance, with bright hazel eyes, rich brown curly hair and mustache, and a glow of health in his cheeks which contrasted strongly with the sallow and livid hue of the duke. The young man held a plumed hat in his left hand, and wore a pair of golden spurs upon his heels, for he was the duke's equerry or master of the horse, as well as a relative. He bore the name of Ferrado Montaldo.</p>
                  <p>"How slept your grace last night?" inquired the master of horse.</p>
                  <p>"As usual, kinsman," replied the duke, who generally adopted a familiar tone in his private conversations with this young man. "Sleep and I are becoming strangers. Or if sleep, coaxed by the wine cup, does visit my eyelids, it comes attended by such a troop of dreams, that, faith! I prefer a wakeful night."</p>
                  <p>"Your grace must be unwell."</p>
                  <p>"My physicians tell me otherwise. They say I have no bodily ailment. Yet they tell me I must take more exercise. How is the weather to-day? Does it promise well for our sport?"</p>
                  <p>"A glorious morning, my lord. There's not a cloud in the sky. You will trace the falcon in his flight far up in the stainless blue, and lose not a motion of his wing as he sweeps upon his prey."</p>
                  <p>"And you bade the huntsmen be in readiness?"</p>
                  <p>"The whole train has been ordered, my lord. Your attendants are already in the saddle. The beaters are ready for their work. The falconers sit with the hooded hawks upon their wrists, and black Astolfo is stamping with impatience in the court-yard."</p>
                  <p>"And our daughter, the Princess Margarita?" asked the duke.</p>
                  <p>"She hath signified her intention of riding forth with us," replied the equerry, "and her horse is saddled beside yours. We shall have glorious sport, my lord. In what direction will you be pleased to ride?"</p>
                  <p>"Towards Monte Rosa."</p>
                  <p>"The villa of Giulio Veroni!"</p>
                  <p>"That name!" cried the duke, a dark frown, like a cloud, passing over his sinister countenance. "No one now bears the name of Veroni but myself. But you mean," he added, with an attempt at a smile, "Brigaldi—the untitled tiller of the soil, the amateur dauber, the exile, my hopeful nephew. To think his doting father once dreamed of bestowing the coronet of Parma on <emph>his</emph> brows!"</p>
                  <p>Ferrado looked down and was silent.</p>
                  <p>"Why are you so mute, man? stricken dumb in a moment!" pursued the duke. "Are you thinking that this boy ought to have filled the throne we occupy?"</p>
                  <p>"Nay, my lord, I was thinking only of the ordering of the hunt to-day."</p>
                  <p>"I believe on my honor your soul is utterly engrossed with your employment. It is well. I would have such men about me," said the duke. "Yet you must help me in my need in other ways than seeing that I am well mounted. Know then, Ferrado, that something more than chasing the heron and hunting the wild boar enters into my plans to-day."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed, my lord!"</p>
                  <p>"Yes—and it is fitting that I give you some inkling of the part that you are to play."</p>
                  <p>"Your grace may always command my poor services."</p>
                  <p>"Of course, my good kinsman—for have I not made you all that you are? I found you a poor relative; I have given you rank, occupation and emolument. You are not overtaxed. Your purse is ever full, you wear fine apparel, you ride forth as well mounted and appointed as myself. There is no limit to the fortune of a man on whom the sunshine of a prince's favor falls. When he inclines to wed, he may raise his eyes to any height. Ay, my good Ferrado, even should he covet the hand of a princess." The duke watched his equerry narrowly as he uttered the last words with marked emphasis, and smiled slightly as he noted the color mounting in the young man's cheek, and animation sparkling in his eyes. "Tell me," he continued, "could you have hoped for any such fortune, had yonder exile ruled over Parma instead of myself?"</p>
                  <p>"Your grace has been my benefactor—my best friend—I owe you all!" replied the equerry. Only tell me in what way I can serve you. My head, my heart and my hand—every faculty of my being—are yours."</p>
                  <p>"I trust you—I trust you entirely," said the duke. "You shall see that I place implicit confidence in you. Come nearer, Ferrado. Think you my throne is firmly established?"</p>
                  <p>"It is impregnable," answered the equerry.</p>
                  <p>"And yet the rightful heir lives!" said the duke.</p>
                  <p>"Your authority is acknowledged without a murmur. Your brother's hold upon the people was weakened before he died. The nobles, the masses, acquiesced in the bold step by which you grasped the reins of power and gave them a firm government. Even the duke of Milan did not protest against it. Surely, after so long an undisturbed enjoyment of your authority, you cannot now doubt its stability!"</p>
                  <p>"My brother's son yet lives."</p>
                  <p>"He lives in exile," replied the equerry, "in contented exile, so says the popular rumor. He divides his time between the culture of the lands your grace's bounty bestowed on him, the sports of the chase, and the pursuits of an artist. His vineyards are flourishing, his rooms are crowded with pictures by his own hand—would this be the case if he were a discontented, ambitious aspirant?"</p>
                  <p>"You reason well, Ferrado," said the duke.</p>
                  <p>"And again—must he not feel that he owed his liberty and life to your grace's favor?"</p>
                  <p>"You remind me," said the duke, gloomily, "that I might have held him in a dungeon, or given his head to the block."</p>
                  <p>"Pardon me, your grace, but extreme measures like those, would not, in my opinion, have been politic, granting that self-preservation authorized your adopting them. Instead of martyrdom, you gave him exile—instead of a dungeon,<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7296-00000005"/> an estate. It was the wisest plan—it disarmed his friends."</p>
                  <p>"They are only quiet, Ferrado, so long as he is contented."</p>
                  <p>"And he is so, my lord. Report speaks him quiet and happy."</p>
                  <p>"We must not trust to hearsay," said the duke. "And this brings me to my project. We shall hunt to-day in the direction of Monte Rosa."</p>
                  <p>"We shall find the game abundant, my liege."</p>
                  <p>"No matter for the game—that is merely a secondary object. You must contrive to separate yourself from us and to penetrate the enchanted abode of the exile."</p>
                  <p>"That is not difficult, my lord. It is protected by neither walls nor gates."</p>
                  <p>"You must contrive to see this Giulio—and that by chance. Let it not appear to be a premeditated interview. You have strayed from your companions, you will say, you are thirsty and crave a cup of wine; frame any plausible tale that may occur to you as an apology. Speak to him; win his confidence, as you know how to win it—and learn his feelings, his views and his intentions."</p>
                  <p>"My life upon it, my lord, that you will find him contented with his lot."</p>
                  <p>"Pray Heaven, it be so; for his sake as well as mine," said the duke. "If it be otherwise, I will find a way to crush this young eaglet. I have tasted the sweets of power, and will not abandon them except with life. Ferrado, I have not forgotten the old life I led as a dependent on the bounty of my brother. Think you I could bear to resign this state, the environment of guards, the salutations of the people, the wealth of the treasure-house, and all that wealth procures me? No—though there be dreams that haunt my slumbers—though there be phantom shapes that stand and mock me in the shadows of the hangings when night comes down upon the palace—though I see the shadow of the assassin falling across my path."</p>
                  <p>"These are but evil dreams, my lord."</p>
                  <p>"They are! they are!" cried the duke. "They vanish in broad daylight, do they not? Wine has the power to dispel them, has it not?"</p>
                  <p>With these words the duke raised a golden goblet, brimming with wine, from the table, and carried it to his lips. But as he was about to drink, he shuddered and turned deadly pale.</p>
                  <p>"Ferrado," he said, almost imploringly, and extending the goblet to him, "will you be my taster?"</p>
                  <p>"Willingly, my lord," replied the young man, and bowing low, he received the goblet from the hands of the sovereign, and quaffed a draught from it before returning it.</p>
                  <p>"Behold one of the conditions of high estate," said the duke, with a bitter smile. "The peasant churl drinks without a fear of the juice of his vine—but the crowned monarch must timorously sip the leavings of a subject's cup. Envy me, Ferrado. To your health."</p>
                  <p>The duke drank off the wine and set down the empty goblet on the table.</p>
                  <p>"There is fire in that Xeres," said he. "It warms my blood. And now to horse. I will drive these shadows from my brain."</p>
                  <p>Escorted by his equerry, and joined by his nobles in the ante-chamber, the duke of Parma descended through glittering files of halberdiers to the court-yard, which presented an animated seene—horses pawing with impatience, dogs yelling in their leashes, plumes waving, spurs jingling, and hawk-bells tinkling on the trained falcons. Radiant in beauty and brilliant in attire, Margarita, the duke's daughter, sat upon her snow white palfrey, which she reined with consummate grace. The duke saluted her kindly as he vaulted into his saddle. The bugles rang out a merry blast, the great gates of the courtyard were thrown wide open, and forth rode the trampling cavalcade amidst the vivas of the populace of Parma. Ah, how few of the envious crowd that gaxed upon that goodly company were aware that beneath those smooth brows and smiling lips lurked agony and care? The countenance of the duke himself was particularly radiant, and he lavished his sunniest smiles upon his loyal subjects.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE FAIRIES' GLEN.</head>
                  <p>ON one of the sides of Monte Rosa was a glen, a deep furrow ploughed by the hand of nature, and extending far down the mountain side. It was a singularly romantic place. The luxuriant soil that covered its sides had given birth to a multitude of trees, embracing every variety peculiar to the latitude. They clustered on the ridges of the ravine, and stealing down into its depths, plunged their strong roots into its dark, stony heart, so that even at noonday, there were points in the glen where the green arch overhead was so dense as to be almost impervious to sunlight and to make a midnight in the lonely dell. But it could never be said to be gloomy. From early dawn the birds were singing in the leaves, and after sunset the plaintive nightingale took up the thread of melody, and continued it till morning. Nor was this the only music of this enchanted spot. From the head of the glen poured down a little mountain streamlet, now springing like a chamois from rock to rock, now gliding swiftly and noiselessly along like a bright serpent, now seattering into a hundred threads, and now united in a broad circling pool. The pool was often black as night with tree shadows, but sometimes a gleam of sunshine penetrating the interstices of the foliage, would dart into the sullen water, revenling its very depths, just as a sudden glimpse of fortune in the life of a lonely man brings forth qualities, the existence of which you never suspected. It would have been a weird place at midnight but for the smiles of the moon, whose light trembled in patches on the surface like glimmering silver fish. But the loneliness of the fairies' glen, for so it was called, was not unfrequently invaded. In the pool the heron came to drink, but scared by a sudden noise would expand his wings and glide away, his long legs trailing behind him, for a bridle road wound through the whole extent of the glen, which it entered by the summit, and following the course of the stream in a zigzag direction, crossed a rustic bridge that had been thrown over the torrent and then came down the other side of the water. Unlike the passage of avernus, the ascent of this road was safe and easy, the deseent precipitous and even dangerous.</p>
                  <p>The reader will now suppose himself transported into the heart of this lovely and romantic glen on the very morning ushered in by the last chapter. The place was as solitary as if the foot of man had never intruded there, and indeed, the evidences of his handiwork in the bridge across the stream and in the road were so slight that you might imagine that both had been produced by the unaided will of nature. The rustic bridge might have been a clump of trees casually thrown across the water by a tempest; the road might have been the dry furrow tracing the path of some former torrent. The small birds twittered among the dewy branches, the fishes leaned in the pool, breaking the dark steel mirror into silvery flashes, and overhead, seen through the opening of the trees formed by the little lake, the sky was serene and cloudless. It looked an unwritten page of Arcadia. The hush was that sort of summer stillness which is not absolute silence—for as gentle airs stirred now and then, the leaves whispered to each other, and myriads of inseet wings made their small music heard. The throbbing of the great heart of nature is always audible, except in those lonely deserts or those Siberian wastes where she appears at times to be parched or frozen to death. Still, if not perfectly silent, the murmur of the stream was slumberous and quiet. A deer might have drank fearlessly of the water without once pausing to listen if danger were at hand.</p>
                  <p>Suddenly there swept across the pool the shadow of wings. A large bird darted over it, and instantly glided off over the upper part of the glen. Swift as an arrow from a bow followed a second bird in pursuit—a small, fieree creature of the hawk species—and almost simultaneously a horse crashed through the branches at full gallop. The rider was a bold one who forced him across the stream and up the rocky bank, but that rider was a woman. With her long hair floating on the breeze created by the rapidity of her motion, her eyes flashing like diamonds with excitement, her rosy lips parted, the Princess Margarita followed the course of the heron and the falcon up the glen. Without a moment's hesitation she dashed over the bridge that a man would have crossed warily on foot, and disappeared through the trees.</p>
                  <p>"Heavens! she will be lost, if she rides at that rate," cried a man, emerging from the bushes. He was dressed in a hunting suit of green velvet, with a silver hugle hanging at his side, a white plume in his hat and a light spear in his hand. It was no other than Giulio Brigaldi.</p>
                  <p>"I should have warned her," he added, addressing a companion who now made his appearance.</p>
                  <p>The second comer was fantastically attired in a parti-colored dress of red and yellow. On his head he wore a cap of the same colors, decked with silver bells, the token of his calling, for this queer personage was no other than a fool, or jester, in those days an indispensable attendant of a man of rank.</p>
                  <p>"I should have warned her, should I not, Tonio?" he repeated.</p>
                  <p>"To what purpose, master of mine?" replied Tonio. "They say a wilful man must have his own way, and I am sure on't, a wilful woman must. You can as soon stop a runaway horse with a bit of straw and a rein of packthread, as hinder a woman from following her whimsies."</p>
                  <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7296-00000006"/>
                  <p>"You malign them, knave. You are always speaking ill of women."</p>
                  <p>"It is but returning the compliment, then," said the jester.</p>
                  <p>"Go up the glen, sirrah," said Giulio, "and post yourself in the pathway at the stone cross, and warn the lady or any other rider, not to return by this road. It were perilous."</p>
                  <p>"To think of <emph>my</emph> running after a woman to hinder her breaking her neck!" said Tonio to himself, as he scrambled up the rocky pathway and disappeared in the distance to execute his master's mandate.</p>
                  <p>Giulio leaned upon his spear musingly.</p>
                  <p>"What a vision of beauty!" thought he. "Who would have dreamed of these solitudes being blessed with such a duzzling image? Who could she be? she was splendidly attired, and in her cap she wore gems worth a duke's ransom. Yet they were dim in the brightness of her eyes."</p>
                  <p>As he gazed mechanically in the direction which the lady had taken, the sky was suddenly darkened. Down swept the heron with the falcon above him in full pursuit.</p>
                  <p>"Bravely flown, my gallant hawk!" cried Giulio, the ardor of the sportsman banishing every other emotion for the moment.</p>
                  <p>But the current of his thought was speedily changed by the reappearance of the princess. She came down the dangerous path at full speed, with a careless rein, her eyes raised to view the progress of the chase. Giulio dared not shout a warning, for fear of startling her horse. He could but wait the result of her rashness in breathless agony. The horse passed the bridge safely, but at the sudden turn of the rocky path, he missed his footing, fell, and as he rolled over, the fair rider was thrown into the torrent, and instantly swept like a floating feather to the pool. The whole scene occupied scarcely a minute, and almost before that period had elapsed, Giulio had plunged into the lake and seizing the precious waif had borne her in safety to the bank. How he hung over her lovely face, watching her return to consciousness! It was not long before she opened her eyes, and perceiving a stranger bending over, the color mounted to her late pallid cheeks.</p>
                  <p>"Where am I?" she asked, gazing around her.</p>
                  <p>"Safe, lady," answered Giulio. "But I fear the consequences of this plunge in the cold stream."</p>
                  <p>"Nay—it was but an unasked-for bath. Nature is bountiful to me," said the princess, with a slight smile.</p>
                  <p>"But your garments are dripping," answered Giulio.</p>
                  <p>"The sun will dry them," replied the lady.</p>
                  <p>"Nay, lady. If you will permit me to offer you the poor shelter of my house, your wants shall be cared for."</p>
                  <p>"It matters not, signor. I must rejoin my friends," said the lady. "Where is Orlando?"</p>
                  <p>The question annoyed Giulio. Was he already in love? Did his heart beat at the mention of a supposed rival?</p>
                  <p>"Orlando?" he repeated.</p>
                  <p>"Ay, signor—my horse."</p>
                  <p>The reply was ready. The animal was near at hand, quietly cropping the grass by the side of the path. The princess held out her tiny hand and called. At the sound of her familiar voice the beautiful animal raised his head, and after gazing at her for a moment with his bright eyes, trotted up to her side and put down his head for the expected caress.</p>
                  <p>"Ah, Orlando!" said the princess, "you are a good and faithful servant. But I taxed your powers too severely, or, rather you missed the hand that should have sustained you when you fell."</p>
                  <p>"Let me," said Giulio, who gazed upon the princess with increasing interest, "permit me to repeat my offer. Let me urge you to accompany me to my villa. You shall be waited on by female attendants, and a blast from my bugle will summon my sister to minister to your needs; she is riding in the forest."</p>
                  <p>The princess appeared to hesitate, as she glanced from the speaker to her wet garments.</p>
                  <p>"Is it far hence to your villa?" she asked.</p>
                  <p>"But a short distance signora. Nay, you must have seen the towers of Monte Rosa as you approached the glen."</p>
                  <p>"Monte Rosa!" exclaimed the princess. "Methinks I have heard that name before."</p>
                  <p>"It is a retired abode with no pretensions to more than comfort," said Giulio.</p>
                  <p>"And Monte Rosa is your residence, signor?"</p>
                  <p>"It is."</p>
                  <p>"You, then, are—" said the princess.</p>
                  <p>"Giulio Brigaldi, at your service, signora."</p>
                  <p>"I—I—have heard your name," said the princess, with a confusion she could ill conceal. "Men speak of you as a skilful painter and farmer."</p>
                  <p>"I am proud of their commendation," replied Giulio, biting his lips. "Yes—the pencil and the pruning knife are more my implements, and at a time when the sword and lance are grasped by manly hands. But enough of this. I shall be happy to offer such comforts as the villa affords."</p>
                  <p>"I thank you with all my heart, signor. Next to Heaven, my thanks are due to you for the very breath with which I coldly utter them; and to-night, when I kneel at the virgin's shrine, to pour out my gratitude for my deliverance your name will mingle with my supplications."</p>
                  <p>"I am more than repaid for an involuntary act," answered Giulio.</p>
                  <p>"The time may come when I may be able to testify my gratitude," continued the princess. "Now I can only thank you in words, while I decline your offer. Nay, urge me not, my friends are hunting in the forest. I shall soon be with them. A note upon this silver whistle will bring my attendants to my side."</p>
                  <p>Giulio's whole frame thrilled as he lifted the princess to her saddle, and placed the rein in her hand. He even fancied that she pressed his hand. She certainly blushed as she bowed to him and wheeled her horse, and once more she looked back before she disappeared from view, and smiled a kind farewell.</p>
                  <p>"No longer," said Giulio, "shall I pursue the ideal in my day dreams. It is found—brighter, fairer far, than any vision that ever dawned upon my path. O, that my skill were equal to my wishes. Such a face should beam upon the canvass, that the world would pay it homage as my heart does now. Who can this enchantress be?"</p>
                  <p>Thus musing, he slowly ascended the glen, and crossed the bridge. As he emerged from the denser portion of the road, he encountered Tonio, his tawdry finery soiled with dust, and his garments in a state of strange disorder.</p>
                  <p>"How now, sirrah!" cried his master. "Can you give me a good reason why I should not break every bone in your worthless careass with my spear-staff?"</p>
                  <p>"Do it! do it!" cried the jester. "The wise man's body is ever the butt for the fool's blows."</p>
                  <p>"What mean you, raseal?"</p>
                  <p>"I mean you will-o'-the-wisp on horseback ran away with your wits when she caused you to send me up the glen to stop her progress to destruction. Here I stood, like a sentinel on duty, to say that no one could pass the line—when, slam! bang! the first thing I knew I was rolling in the dust, with a vision of horse's heels passing over, and the long garments of a flying witch trailing on the wind."</p>
                  <p>"Poor fellow! I forgive you," said Giulio.</p>
                  <p>"It is easy to forgive those we have injured," said the jester.</p>
                  <p>"Get you to the villa, Tonio," said Giulio, "and here's compensation for your injuries," he added, giving him a piece.</p>
                  <p>"There's no ointment for broken bones like gold," said the jester. "One can pocket any affront in this shape."</p>
                  <p>With these words he retired, leaving Giulio to indulge in day dreams—for he was in love, Enthusiastic, impressionable, imaginable, more of a poet than a practical man, it was not difficult to interest and excite him, and the person and manners of the princess would have moved a statue.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE CROSS OF GOLD.—THE WARNING AND THE SPY.</head>
                  <p>IN another part of the forest, Ferrado, who had dismounted from his horse and sent him away in charge of a groom to a certain spot which the duke had indicated as a rendezvous for his hunting party, was slowly pacing the shaded footpath, reflecting upon the mission with which he had been entrusted by his master, and revolving the manner in which he should acquit himself thereof. As he thus advanced, with his eyes fixed upon the ground, he suddenly discovered a sparkling object half hidden by the grass. He picked it up and examined it. It was a small golden cross of elaborate workmanship, covered with minute carved figures which the skill of Benvenuto Cellini might have been proud to acknowledge. He turned it over in his hand and saw the name of "Estella" engraven on the back. The lustre of the ornament was undimmed, and it had evidently been but just lost by the owner. While he stood contemplating the cross, a horsewoman, whose approach the velvet turf had prevented him from hearing suddenly reined up before him. He looked up and gazed with involuntary admiration on the exquisite beauty of the fair apparition. The lady, on her part, somewhat disconcerted by the close attention of the courtier, blushed deeply, a circumstance which added to the effect of her charms already flushed by the animation of exercise.</p>
                  <p>"Signora," said the equerry, respectfully, "I<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC7296-00000007"/> am induced to hope that in you I have found the owner of this little article," and he extended the glittering cross he had just been contemplating.</p>
                  <p>"It is indeed mine, signor," replied Estella. "That cross is one of my highest-prized treasures—it belonged to my mother. I missed it this moment, and turned back in the forlorn hope of finding it in the path I had just traversed."</p>
                  <p>"It gives me great pleasure to be the means of restoring it," said Ferrado, bowing.</p>
                  <p>"I thank you most heartily, signor," replied the lady, as she received the ornament; and then bowing to the stranger she wheeled her horse round and prepared to ride off.</p>
                  <p>"Stay one moment, lady," said the equerry, anxious to prolong the interview upon any pretext. "I am seeking the villa of Monte Rosa—and this wood is a perfect labyrinth. Perhaps you can direct me thither."</p>
                  <p>"You were in the right road," replied Estella. "You have only to follow the path, you will soon come to an opening in the wood from which you will see the towers."</p>
                  <p>"Are you acquainted with the inmates, signora?"</p>
                  <p>"I am one of them, signor," replied the lady.</p>
                  <p>"Indeed! then you can perhaps inform me whether Signor Brigaldi is at home?"</p>
                  <p>"My brother went forth early this morning," replied Estella. "But he should be returned by this hour. If he is not there, I will send one of the servants for him. <foreign xml:lang="ITA">Addio,</foreign> signor."</p>
                  <p>And bowing to the equerry, the fair equestrian touched her horse and cantered off through the greenwood.</p>
                  <p>"She is a glorious creature!" thought Ferrado.</p>
                  <p>"Born to grace a court. Which of the dames of Parma can compare with her in attraction? I ever thought the duke's daughter a peerless creature—but beside this lady, her beauty would be lustreless. Estella! I shall see her again, perhaps at the villa."</p>
                  <p>With this reflection he resumed his walk. Ferrado was peculiarly susceptible to the influence of female charms, and was, moreover, just of the age when beauty exerts its greatest sway over the human heart. This vision of loveliness imparted a new charm to his existence; the day seemed brighter, the sunshine more golden, the air more perfumed. Perhaps it would have been better for the success of his diplomacy had he not encountered this radiant fairy. Beauty has more than once foiled the arts of a practised politician.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile Estella rode on towards the villa. She, too, had been favorably impressed by the appearance of the cavalier she had just encountered. He was handsome, courteous and richly attired—and accustomed as she was to see herself surrounded only by peasants, she could not fail to note the contrast he presented to those men of toil. He realized, or, at least, approached very near to that ideal of an accomplished suitor which she had dared to dream of in her lonely reveries. And what girl of eighteen, at least what Italian girl, has not such day dreams? If Ferrado had the person of Romeo, Estella had the passionate heart of Juliet.</p>
                  <p>Musing on this little adventure, she had insensibly drawn her bridle-rein, and was walking her horse along the velvet pathway, when she met her brother coming in an opposite direction. She blushed scarlet, scarce knowing way.</p>
                  <p>"You here, brother!" she exclaimed.</p>
                  <p>"You appear very much astonished, Estella. Pray, where should I be?"</p>
                  <p>"O, I thought you were at the villa."</p>
                  <p>"It is not unusual for me to wander for hours in the woods on such a day as this."</p>
                  <p>"Well, brother, there is a cavalier going there to pay you a visit."</p>
                  <p>"How did you know that?"</p>
                  <p>"I met him by chance inquiring his way to the villa."</p>
                  <p>"What manner of man was he?"</p>
                  <p>"I did not take particular note of him," (O, Estella!) "but he was a gentleman, richly dressed in a hunting garb, and he wore golden spurs."</p>
                  <p>"'Tis he! Where is he, Estella?"</p>
                  <p>"He is following this path on foot."</p>
                  <p>"Very well. Ride on to the villa. I will join you there before long."</p>
                  <p>"Shall you bring the cavalier with you?"</p>
                  <p>"Perhaps—I cannot tell."</p>
                  <p>Estella rode on, hoping that she should before long again meet the stranger.</p>
                  <p>Now, a few moments before Giulio had encountered his sister, he had met a groom in the forest, who, after inquiring his name, gave him a note and immediately rode off. The note contained the following lines:</p>
                  <p>"Forewarned, forearmed. You are an object of suspicion to the Duke of Parma. He has sent a spy to interrogate you, Ferrado Montaldo, his master of horse, a dark haired man, wearing a gold bugle horn and golden spurs. If you are discontented with your lot, conceal it from him. Foil Italian diplomacy by Italian shrewdness. I cannot say how much depends on your discretion. Destroy this as soon as read. YOUR FRIEND."</p>
                  <p>Giulio obeyed the injunction, tore the missive into minute fragments and scattered them to the winds, curious to know who could have thus become interested in his fate and fortune. At first he thought the warning might be a jest, but his brief interview with his sister dispelled this idea. He hastened therefore to meet the spy, dismissing every trace of suspicion from his countenance, and wearing the serene expression which was habitual to him. He had not advanced many paces from the spot where he had encountered his sister, before he saw the master of horse coming towards him. Ferrado, as he approached, paused and raised his cap in salutation.</p>
                  <p>"Can you inform me, signor," he asked, "if I am in the right direction for the villa of Monte Rosa?"</p>
                  <p>"This path leads directly to the villa, signor."</p>
                  <p>"I am in quest of the owner," said Ferrado.</p>
                  <p>"I am at your service," replied Giulio.</p>
                  <p>"What!" exclaimed Ferrado, with a joyous air. "Am I indeed addressing Giulio Veroni?"</p>
                  <p>"That is a name I have renounced, signor," replied Giulio, calmly. "I am known as Giulio Brigaldi."</p>
                  <p>"Pardon me—I cannot forget that you are entitled to a name intimately associated with the historical glories of Parma. Let me make myself known to you. My name is Ferrado Montaldo. Straitened circumstances compelled me to take service under the reigning duke. I am his kinsman, and consequently yours. Give me your hand, my dear cousin. We should have met long ago."</p>
                  <p>Giulio accepted the profered hand of his kinsman, and shook it warmly.</p>
                  <p>"Come," said he, "you must see how I am lodged in the Villa Rosa. It must never be said that my kinsman was within arrow flight of my house and went away without drinking one cup of wine, or breaking a morsel of bread with me. My sister, too, will aid to made her kinsman welcome."</p>
                  <p>"The temptation is very great," said Ferrado, with apparent hesitation. "I have met your sister. She is indeed charming, cousin. But you forget I am a slave, Giulio. The very spurs upon my heels are not given me that I may ride where I will, but that I may hasten to obey the mandates of a—tyrant—yes! that is the word, kinsman. In your ear, I may breathe it without fear of the consequence. I escaped from the ducal retinue in the hope of gaining a brief interview with you, but I must not go out of ear shot of the duke's bugles. He is a hard task master."</p>
                  <p>"You do him injustice, Montaldo. Report speaks him a good ruler. It is said that the people of Parma were never so happy as under his sway. A judicious management of the finances has lightened the taxes of the people. The reigning duke is not immoderate in his pleasures, he has placed good judges on the bench, he has kept peace with his neighbors, at the same time that he has repelled aggression, not by force, but by dignity and firmness."</p>
                  <p>"All this is true to a certain extent," said Ferrado, "though if I were disposed to contest the point with you, I could easily show that you have exaggerated the merits of the sovereign. But it matters not how good a use he has made of his power—he is a usurper."</p>
                  <p>"There are times when men of ability are justified in grasping the reins of power," replied Giulio. "Usurpation is palliated by the acquiescence of the people governed. You forget that I was a mere boy when my father died."</p>
                  <p>"Why did not Francisco administer the duchy as regent during your minority, and resign the throne to you when you came of age? You inherited the blood and talent of a noble race; the ducal coronet of Parma was and is a prize worth grasping."</p>
                  <p>"An empire is worth nothing, if the heir has no ambition."</p>
                  <p>"And do you tell me that you have no ambition, Giulio?" asked Ferrado, fixing his eyes keenly upon his kinsman.</p>
                  <p>"Yes—I have ambition," answered Giulio. "Idesire to transmit my name to posterity; I were else unworthy of my lineage. But there is more than one path to fame. Think you the ruler or the soldier monopolizes the glory of this world? Is it nothing to paint like Raphael or Michael Angelo? Is it nothing to be a poet? Is it nothing even to cover these hillsides with vines and fruit trees and flowers?"</p>
                  <p>"In truth, you have a noble estate here."</p>
                  <p>"I hold it from my uncle."</p>
                  <p>"Very true," replied Ferrado, with a sneer. "He robbed you of the whole duchy, which was yours, and gave you a mountain side to vegetate upon! Truly you ought to be very grateful."</p>
                  <p>"A man has always enough when he has content."</p>
                  <p>"I cannot think of your wrongs without indignation<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7296-00000008"/> nation!" exclaimed Ferrado. "You, a noble, tilling the soil like a base peasant! You, gifted and learned, wasting your time in daubing pictures! You, trimming vines and planting olive trees, when you ought to be reining a war horse, and leading the Italian chivalry to deeds of prowess! How can you exist in such mediocrity?"</p>
                  <p>"My dear kinsman," answered Giulio, mildly, "you forget that a fall is most to be feared in the loftiest station. The blast that prostrates the tall oak but bends the flower at its foot. Books have served me in lieu of experience, and I know that greatness is but another word for care and unrest. I am under obligations to the duke for sparing me the miseries and temptations of a more exalted station."</p>
                  <p>"Do you never think, then, of the injuries he has inflicted on you?" asked the persevering Ferrado.</p>
                  <p>"I think only of enjoying this peaceful villa, which contains within its narrow limits more than you can find in builded palaces. What pictures can compare to the thousand ever varying and ever charming views that nature presents? What canopy of Genon velvet so rich as this elm which droops its pendulous branches ever glorious in the wealth of its unrivalled verdure? What Venetian mirror truer, brighter than the pools in the greenwood? What broidery of fair hands can equal the myriad flowers that gem the velvet turf? None of these grow old; they renew themselves annually without cost. Those riches which are not subject to the vicissitudes of fortune, are dearer to me than those which you seem to imagine I regret."</p>
                  <p>"Do you not desire to triumph over a cruel avidity?"</p>
                  <p>"All my desires are confined to the enjoyment of the blessings of the country, and to the continuance of the sweet society of my sister. Nature never deceives my hopes."</p>
                  <p>"Is it possible for a man to forget to this extent that he was born to reign?" exclaimed Ferrado.</p>
                  <p>"Power is a vain dream. Of all worldly vanities, what does man really possess? Food, clothing. Why should I crave for possessions I could not enjoy?"</p>
                  <p>"Solitude has made you a misanthrope."</p>
                  <p>"On the contrary, it has made me a philosopher. But enough of this. Will you walk to the villa?"</p>
                  <p>"No, no, Giulio. I should fear a spell would come upon me. I like fine garments, fine horses, lovely ladies, splendid pageantry, the glitter and whirl of the court circle. I should stifle in these solitudes. But I may take occasion to visit you."</p>
                  <p>"You will always be sure of a welcome."</p>
                  <p>"That I doubt not, and I thank you for the offer."</p>
                  <p>The equerry raised his bugle to his lips and blew a call. In a few moments a mounted groom appeared, leading a saddled charger. Without touching his foot to the stirrup, Ferrado vaulted into the saddle, and giving the spur to his horse, rode sharply away.</p>
                  <p>"Farewell, minion of the court!" said Giulio, to himself. "A few such specimens of the satellites of power, willing slaves, and I could indeed be content to pass my life in these solitudes. Nor should I ever crave place or power, the throne or the battle field, had I a partner in my lot; such a one as this lady of the Fairies' Glen. Shall I never see her again? Yet how unlikely that we shall ever meet. She is evidently one of the ladies of the court, and I am forbidden to set foot in the city. I could almost risk my head on the chance of meeting her again. But I must curb the swellings of my heart, and learn to endure my lot."</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE ASTROLOGER AND HIS PATRON. THE MIDNIGHT MARCH.</head>
                  <p>IN the cabinet of Francisco Veroni, the usurping Duke of Parma, there was a certain panel in the wainscoting, concealed by the rich hangings, which was furnished with a spring that, on being pressed, the panel slid back, disclosing a narrow, winding stairway. In fact, the dueal palace was a perfect labyrinth of secret passages, places of concealment and acoustic apparatus for conveying a whisper from one part of the edifice to another. Many of these devices were of older date than the period of our story, but Francisco had added to them, for he was by nature a coward, and the arms of timidity are cunning and concealment. The passage, to which particular allusion has been made, conducted to the apartments of a learned man, in the employ of the duke as his astrologer. Superstition still attributed to the stars a mysterious influence over the destinies of men, and to the fallen science of astrology the power of fathoming those starry influences and of reading in the combinations and movements of the heavenly bodies the story of their fate. There was something flattering to the vanity of the great in the belief that their destinies were recorded on the crystal battlements of heaven in letters of undying fire; that, at the period of their birth, a new star burst forth on high, commissioned to be the beacon of their hopes, or the lurid index of their woes. No honors, no treasures, were too great for the gifted one who possessed this pretended gift of divination and the learning, which would have been neglected by the ignorant and brutal princes of the dark ages had it appealed directly for their support, was encouraged indirectly under the guise of astrology, so that the accurate science of the present day owes much of its perfection to the superstition of the past. The belief in astrology, however, was so universal, it formed so certain a portion of the creed of the age, that few of the astrologers could fairly be called impostors. Most of them believed what they taught, at least at the outset of their career.</p>
                  <p>Magnus, the astrologer, had been but a few years resident at the court of Parma. Whence he came, no one knew, but it was supposed from the East, the birthplace of science. Men said, indeed, that he possessed strange gifts, that he had discovered the elixir of life while pursuing his studies in Egypt, and that he bore a charmed existence, proof against disease and violence.</p>
                  <p>He had suddenly appeared one day before the gates of Parma, a tall, majestic looking man, with a long silver beard, clad in the richest Oriental costume, and accompanied by a train of Nubians splendidly attired and armed. A file of pack horses were laden with his goods. To the captain of the guard, whom he addressed in choice Italian, he presented a pass from the duke, authorizing the entrance of himself and train, and commanding that the utmost respect should be paid him. He was accordingly admitted within the city, and moved directly to the palace, where he had a long private interview with the duke. While this conference lasted, the courtiers and hangers on of the palace endeavored to be obtain some information of the stranger's attendants respecting their master. But not one of the sable servitors proffered a word. They shook their heads on being addressed, and on being closely plied with questions, frowned savagely and laid their hands upon their yataghans. At the conclusion of the interview between the duke and his mysterious visitor, orders came from the former to transport the effects of the stranger into the upper story of one of the wings of the palace. This done, the train which had escorted the guest into the city took its departure, moving forth in a glittering cavalcade, and from that day not one of them had returned. Nor was the astrologer, for such it was soon rumored that he was, ever seen, save by the duke himself and two or three old and confidential servants, who went into the tower where he lodged, from time to time, to put it in order, and to carry thither fuel, of which he used large quantities, stores of food and wine, and other necessaries of life.</p>
                  <p>These men were, of course, at first closely questioned as to what they beheld in the mysterious apartments which they had the privilege of visiting; but they refused any answer, and the duke, finding how much they were annoyed, hinted that such interrogations would not be permitted. A hint was found quite sufficient, as no one cared to brave the indignation of the duke, and so the life of Magnus, the astrologer, remained an impenetrable mystery to the court. Men and women contented themselves with watching and surmises, and there was no end of the stories circulated with regard to the avocations and attributes of the stranger. The sentinels on duty in the night observed that lights were never extinguished in the astrologer's tower. And these lights were of changeful hue. Sometimes, through the loopholes of his apartment, strange crimson rays shot forth like arrows on the night. At other times, ghastly blue and green flames rose from the chimneys, lighting up the surrounding turrets and tree-tops with a spectral glare. More than once a dull explosion had been heard. Of course, the superstitious minds of the observers of these phenomena attributed to the stranger a commerce with the enemy of man, and many a credulous eye saw, in the midnight storm-cloud, the wing of the familiar demon, sweeping through the sky, to visit his mortal ally and associate. We have thus rapidly indicated the position and popular character of a personage about to be introduced to the reader, in connection with our narrative. We will now pass to the apartment of the duke on the evening of the day of the hunting party.</p>
                  <p>He had laid aside his hunting dress for a richer and easier garb, and was engaged in conversation with his equerry, all other attendants having been dismissed.</p>
                  <p>"Now, then, Ferrado," said the duke, "I have had no opportunity of questioning you before. You saw him?"</p>
                  <p>"Ay, my lord."</p>
                  <pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7296-00000009"/>
                  <p>"And questioned him?"</p>
                  <p>"Carefully and closely. Machiavelli himself could not have conducted the examination more adroitly or plausibly, nor have found a franker or more unsuspicious subject to deal with."</p>
                  <p>"Well, go on."</p>
                  <p>"My lord, he is as harmless as a dove. He is void of ambition as a cloistered man. He is a philosopher."</p>
                  <p>"What did he say?"</p>
                  <p>"In the first place, I must ask your grace's pardon for the liberty I took in representing myself to Giulio as a discontented subject—as strongly attached to the old duke and his son."</p>
                  <p>"I believe my brother <emph>was</emph> an especial favorite with you," said the duke, drily.</p>
                  <p>"With me, my lord!" said the courtier. "He scarcely knew me. I was a mere boy when he died, and was indebted to him for no favors,—while to you I owe all."</p>
                  <p>"Leave out protestations of loyalty," said the duke, impatiently. "What said this Giulio Brigaldi?"</p>
                  <p>"He talked like a poet, a peasant, a philosopher. Babbled about his fields, and nature, railed against the follies of the court, lauded your grace's administration, your bounty to himself, and proclaimed himself a perfectly contented man."</p>
                  <p>"A Phoenix which philosophers and divines have never yet been able to discover!" said the duke, sarcastically. "I congratulate you on your fortunate discovery."</p>
                  <p>"Your highness seems to doubt my tale."</p>
                  <p>"I doubt not, Ferrado, that you have reported the <emph>words</emph> of this young gentleman correctly. But the countenance often gives the tongue the lie. How looked he when he made his declaration?"</p>
                  <p>"His expression was that of perfect candor; I can conceive of nothing more guileless. I think you may trust his declaration implicitly, my lord," said the equerry.</p>
                  <p>"Ferrado," said the duke, rising, and laying his hand on the arm of the equerry, "I doubt, I doubt! He has deceived you; he cannot hoodwink me. But enough for the present. You must be weary; get you to your bed. <emph>You</emph> can sleep. Restlessness and vigil are my lot. But stay—is there not in my troop of horseguards a man who was lately in the employ of Giulio?"</p>
                  <p>"Ay, my lord,—Ramon Castro, a Catalan of Spain."</p>
                  <p>"It is well. Adieu, Ferrado! pleasant dreams to you."</p>
                  <p>The master of horse retired with a low obeisance.</p>
                  <p>"I must see this man myself," muttered the duke. "His image haunts me day and night, and portends danger. If the astrologer confirms my fears, my resolution is taken."</p>
                  <p>Lifting the hanging, and pressing the secret panel, the spring flew back, and the duke entered the secret passage and ascended to the astrologer's apartment.</p>
                  <p>The room he entered was a laboratory; a furnace, retorts, chemical apparatus, mingled with implements of unknown utility, crowded the room, which was pervaded by a pungent odor. The astrologer was seated at a table, with a parchment filled with cabalistic signs and figures, spread out before him.</p>
                  <p>He did not rise on the entrance of the duke, but contented himself with a salutation of the head. The duke seated himself near him, and addressed him rather with the manner of a client conferring with his advocate, than a ruler addressing his subject.</p>
                  <p>"Thou hast perused the stars lately, my friend?" asked the duke, with a tremulous voice.</p>
                  <p>"Every night I study them," replied the astrologer, "and every day I base my calculations on the observations."</p>
                  <p>"And what is their aspect?"</p>
                  <p>"They portend danger to thee."</p>
                  <p>"Danger!" exclaimed the duke.</p>
                  <p>"Ay, danger to thy throne. There is a star whose influence threatens to eclipse yours. I know not who he is,—that my art cannot tell; but there is a mortal who, I am convinced, is plotting against your security."</p>
                  <p>"And is the danger near or distant?"</p>
                  <p>"It is near at hand."</p>
                  <p>"Thanks for the warning; I shall know how to meet it. I have had a presentiment of this."</p>
                  <p>"There are ever, my lord, invisible spirits, the messengers of yonder bright luminaries, who are whispering in our ears the timely warning. Woe to those who turn a deaf ear to their suggestions!"</p>
                  <p>"I am not one of those," said the duke. "I am ever hearkening to their mysterious voice. Once more thanks, and good-night."</p>
                  <p>The duke rose, and as he departed, laid a purse, filled with gold, upon the astrologer's table. The wise man gave no heed to the tribute,—at least, in the presence of the duke; but when the latter retired, he clutched it convulsively, poured out the contents on the table, counted them piece by piece, and then restoring them to the purse, locked it up carefully in a huge iron chest that stood beside him.</p>
                  <p>"Gold! gold!—glorious gold!" he muttered. "I shall be rich—rich to the extent of my heart's desire!"</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile the duke descended to his cabinet, and blew a shrill note upon the silver whistle which he always wore, suspended to his girdle by a gold chain.</p>
                  <p>In a moment an attendant stood before him, craving his commands.</p>
                  <p>"Send me the captain of my cavalier guard."</p>
                  <p>In a very few moments, for night and day he awaited the bidding of his master, a bronzed warrior, sheathed in steel, entered the apartment and saluted the duke.</p>
                  <p>"You can read, I believe, Gonelli?" said the duke.</p>
                  <p>"Like a clerk, my liege."</p>
                  <p>"Here are your orders, then," said the duke, giving him a paper he had been writing. "Take ten picked men, among them Ramon Castro, the Spaniard, and fail not, on your head, to execute the mission confided to you. By an hour after sunrise, to-morrow, I shall expect your return."</p>
                  <p>"My life shall answer for me," said the soldier.</p>
                  <p>Ten minutes afterward, the trampling of horse was heard in the court-yard, and the file detailed by the duke rode through the palace gateway at a sharp trot.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE MIDNIGHT VISITOR,—A PRINCE'S INVITATION.</head>
                  <p>THE night had commenced fair and cloudless, but in proportion as the hour advanced, a change had gradually been coming on the scene. Mists had risen from the valley, chilling the frame of the benighted travellers, and now portentous clouds were rising rapidly, pushing each other along, their black drapery almost sweeping the hills. A deep hush pervaded all nature; but it was not a soothing quiet, it was that unnatural calm which is the prophet of commotion. Captain Gonelli rode in advance of his troop, looking neither to the right hand nor the left, his brows knit in the effort to penetrate the darkness, his bridle-hand steady and firm, feeling his horse's mouth, but not pulling on the heavy bit. From time to time he loosened his sword in its steel sheath, and from time to time striking back his rowels, he mended the pace of his powerful but somewhat sluggish charger.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile the men conversed with each other in whispers. Fierce fellows, who passed their time between the guard-room and the saddle, who bartered hard blows for hard coin, would have charged through a legion in the broad daylight, they liked not this midnight excursion to which they had been summoned from the flagon and the dice-box. It is said that the bravest men are cowards in the dark, and though these bravoes rode stirrup to stirrup, and were not insensible to the cheering influence of companionship, still the gathering storm and the midnight darkness, acting on their superstitions minds, produced a vague feeling of terror.</p>
                  <p>"I would it were six hours later or earlier," muttered Pianori, a Corsican, through his thick moustache to his flank comrade. "Everything betokens a storm, and the lightning loves to play with a steel corslet, and often finds a crevice in a gorget that lance-point could never discover. And they do say," he added, "that the evil one rides abroad on such nights as this, with a train of spirits from the place of torment for attendants. Mortal foe I fear not—but I can't fight with phantoms i' the dark."</p>
                  <p>"Tush!" replied his comrade. "I am proof against the spirits of the air. I wear a bleased relie next my heart, which cost me a round score of ducats. I grudged the red gold, when I was chaffering with the Capuchin about the bargain for the golden sunshine was blazing through the guard-room windows, and I thought, had the huckster been other than a priest and no lookers on at hand, I would have paid him with steel from my dagger sheath rather than coin from my purse. But now the relie of the blessed saint I feel to be beyond all price."</p>
                  <p>"Look!" said the Corsican. "Do you see that pale blue flame on the lance-points of our file leaders? By all the saints! my own spearhead is blazing! It is an evil omen." And the savage hireling crossed himself.</p>
                  <p>The phenomenon that alarmed him was a manifestation of the ondition of the atmosphere, the steel lance-points of the riders having attracted the electricity of the low hang clouds, but in those days it was quite sufficient to excite the fears of the ignorant. Other soldiers perceived it, and murmurs arose.</p>
                  <p>"Silence in the ranks!" cried the stern voice of the leader, as he reined back his horse to allow he troop to close up. "What is the reason of<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7296-00000010"/> these unseemly murmurs? Gottfried, what is it?"</p>
                  <p>The man he addressed was a veteran German, who, though sixty years of age, was as erect and active as any man in the command.</p>
                  <p>"Noble captain," said the veteran, saluting his officer, "if you will but look around you, you will see cause enough for the murmuring. The foul fiend and his imps are abroad to-night, I verily believe, and he hath affixed his signal-lights to every lance-point."</p>
                  <p>"And if he were here with a legion of his imps," replied the leader, raising his voice so that every one of the men heard him, "I should spit at and defy him. Are we not the soldiers of a Christian prince, and true children of the church, every cut-throat of us? The powers of darkness cannot prevail against us."</p>
                  <p>"But, noble captain," continued the veteran, "the signs of the heavens are portentous. We are on the eve of a fearful storm. Don't you hear the batteries of heaven opening overhead?"</p>
                  <p>"The sooner then that we accomplish our orders the better. The prince hath sent us forth for a certain purpose, and it shall be accomplished, if the heavens rain fire and the earth opens beneath my horse's feet. Forward then, comrades; make good use of your rowels, and the sooner will you return to cup and trencher."</p>
                  <p>Stirring his horse with the steel, Gonelli dashed onward, followed by his troop at a sharp trot, and for a few minutes nothing interrupted the unnatural hush of the night but the clatter of hoof, the ringing of curb-chains, and the clash of scabbard and stirrup.</p>
                  <p>They had not ridden far, however, when the storm overtook them. It burst down with fearful fury; the wind, a perfect hurricane, roaring through the gorges of the hills, twisting branches from trees and strewing them in the road, while peal on peal of thunder shook the very earth. The lightning blazed from every point of the compass—piercing, blinding flashes, cleaving the air at every moment, and terrifying the horses so that it required the utmost efforts of the riders to control them. The plumage was tost and torn on the crests of the cavaliers, and they were compelled to bend forward over their saddle-bows to resist the fury of the sweeping blast. The rain, at first pattering in huge drops, came down at last in a deluge, so that the whole country, sheeted with water, and blazing with lightning, looked like a sea of fire.</p>
                  <p>Captain Gonelli summoned the Spaniard, Ramon, to his side.</p>
                  <p>"Know you whereabouts we are now?" he asked.</p>
                  <p>"Ay, captain, I could find my way hither like a sleuth-hound in the dark, and there is light enow, by the mass! to discern the smallest object. We are almost at the turn now."</p>
                  <p>"And then?"</p>
                  <p>"I will lead you, if you like."</p>
                  <p>"Do so," replied Gonelli, "and beware of misleading me."</p>
                  <p>"Never fear," replied the Spaniard, riding to the front.</p>
                  <p>The troop followed in single file. The guide suddenly wheeled his horse, and stooping, to avoid the hanging branches of a sturdy oak, turned to the left into a bridle-path through a wood. The ground here was very slippery, and the riders necessarily slackened their pace as they advanced. They soon came to a torrent, commonly a mere thread of water, but now increased prodigiously in volume by the rain. Through this they boldly dashed, though the water rose to their saddle girths, and then struggled up the opposite bank. After riding a few hundred yards farther, the guide drew rein.</p>
                  <p>"Captain," he whispered, "we have reached the spot."</p>
                  <p>"'Tis well," answered Gonelli, and wheeling his horse, he gave the command to halt, in a low but perfectly audible tone. "You will keep the men here, Gottfried," he added, addressing the German veteran, "till I return. See that no man leaves his saddle."</p>
                  <p>He then moved forward with the Spaniard. They soon reached a building of some size, when the captain halted, and giving his bridle-rein to Ramon, dismounted, and approaching a low door studded with spikes, knocked loudly on it with his mailed hand. There was no reply for some minutes. He repeated the summons, and after another delay a wicket in the door was opened, and a voice inquired:</p>
                  <p>"Who goes there?"</p>
                  <p>"A friend," was the reply. "A benighted traveller, overtaken by the storm."</p>
                  <p>"Wait, friend, till I undo the bolts, and then you shall find a welcome entrance," replied the voice.</p>
                  <p>In a short time the door was opened, and Gonelli sprang into the building, and closed it behind him. At the sight of an armed man, Tonio, the jester, for it was he who had opened the door, started back, nearly extinguishing the torch he held, and uttered an exclamation of surprise and terror.</p>
                  <p>"Not a whisper, knave!" said the soldier, sternly, "or—" and he laid his hand menacingly on his dagger.</p>
                  <p>"Good signor soldier," said the jester, between his chattering teeth, "you would not harm a poor fool."</p>
                  <p>"Not if the poor fool acts the part of a wise man, and keeps his tongue within his teeth."</p>
                  <p>"There's many a wise man who cannot govern his tongue, and you expect a poor fool to do so. Marry, sir, me thinks I should hail you as a brother."</p>
                  <p>"Silence, dog; is your master within?"</p>
                  <p>"My master is within, most noble signor, but he is not visible on account of the darkness of the night. He is suffering an occupation—an eclipse."</p>
                  <p>"Lead me to him, sirrah," said the soldier, fiercely, grasping the jester by the collar. "I am weary of this bantering."</p>
                  <p>"If you mean him harm," said the jester, warming in turn, and shaking off the soldier's grasp, "you shall only reach him over my dead body."</p>
                  <p>"Bravely said!" exclaimed the soldier. "The spirit of a man-at-arms is in that fool's head of thine. I seek not to harm your master, that I tell you on the word of a soldier. Does that suit you?"</p>
                  <p>"Since there is no better pledge, I must e'en rest contented. And there is something in your looks that assures me you would not deceive. Then follow, most noble signor, and I will conduct you to the apartment of the lord of the villa, without the slightest fear that you will stab me in the back as I precede you. March on—folly first, valor afterward."</p>
                  <p>Treading close upon the heels of Tonio, the captain ascended to the second floor, and then, after passing through a long corridor, paused, with his conductor, before a door.</p>
                  <p>"Shall I disturb the sweet slumbers of my lord?" asked Tonio.</p>
                  <p>"Knock, sirrah, without more ado!" said Gonelli.</p>
                  <p>The jester knocked.</p>
                  <p>"Who goes there?" said a voice from within.</p>
                  <p>"It is I—Tonio, your friend and counsellor," replied the jester.</p>
                  <p>"Is it morning—is it time to rise?" asked Giulio, from within.</p>
                  <p>"It is not morning, but it is time to rise," replied Tonio. "Here is a gallant gentleman to pay his service to your greatness."</p>
                  <p>"This is some foolery of thine, knave," replied Giulio, in an angry voice. "But if thou art playing me a trick at this unseasonable hour, thy back and the scourge shall be made acquainted."</p>
                  <p>"No need of an introduction, they are old friends," muttered Tonio, as he pushed open the door, and holding his torch on high, led the visitor to his master's bedside.</p>
                  <p>As soon as Giulio's eyes became accustomed to the light, he sprang from the bed and grasped for his sword, which usually lay beside him—but it was gone.</p>
                  <p>"Traitor!" he cried, grasping Tonio by the throat. "You have betrayed and disarmed me!"</p>
                  <p>"Don't harm the fool," said the captain. "Here is your weapon. The moment my eyes rested on it, I seized it. Not that it would avail anything against a coat of mail, but gentlemen roused suddenly out of their slumbers, are apt to do rash things when they first waken."</p>
                  <p>"Whence come you? Who are you? What is your purpose?" asked Giulio.</p>
                  <p>"From Parma—captain of the ducal guard—to conduct you to court," answered Gonelli.</p>
                  <p>"Where are your credentials?"</p>
                  <p>"Here," replied the captain, presenting a parchment scroll to Giulio.</p>
                  <p>The latter perused it thoughtfully. He appeared somewhat disturbed, but he answered:</p>
                  <p>"Retire for a moment. I will dress myself, inform my sister of this circumstance, and then he ready to depart."</p>
                  <p>"Pardon me," said the soldier, "I cannot permit you to communicate with any one."</p>
                  <p>"Not with my sister?"</p>
                  <p>"With no one whomsoever."</p>
                  <p>Giulio glanced at Tonio in a peculiar manner, the latter replied by a look of intelligence, and nodded. The keen eye of the soldier noted these signs. Without saying a word he beckoned to the jester, and they left Giulio alone to perform his toilet.</p>
                  <p>"Now, my friend," said Gonelli, "isn't this a fine night, or rather morning, for time is verging on the latter, for a ride?"</p>
                  <p>"The storm is hardly over," said the jester. "But for them that like the saddle, all hours are propitious."</p>
                  <p>"Well, how should you like to accompany your master?"</p>
                  <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7296-00000011"/>
                  <p>"Well enough, for the matter of that," replied Tonio. "And now I think of it, I'll go and saddle my mule."</p>
                  <p>"You shall do no such thing, my friend," said the captain, laying an iron grasp upon his shoulder.</p>
                  <p>The jester looked disconcerted.</p>
                  <p>"You are fond of my company," he muttered, ironically.</p>
                  <p>"So much so that I cannot spare you from my sight a single moment. And yet so jealous am I, that if you attempt to desert me, I'll cut your throat from ear to ear."</p>
                  <p>"I shouldn't like to have such an open countenance," said the jester uneasily. "Is that the way you cut your acquaintances?"</p>
                  <p>"When they show an inclination to cut and run," replied the captain, grimly.</p>
                  <p>At this moment Giulio appeared. He was plainly attired, and had thrown his cloak over his shoulders. He wore a sheathed rapier at his belt. He looked pale and firm.</p>
                  <p>"Tonio, you will remain here until my return," said he.</p>
                  <p>"Answer him 'yes,'" whispered Gonelli, in the jester's ear.</p>
                  <p>"Certainly, certainly, signor," replied Tonio.</p>
                  <p>"Will you give me your word as a soldier," continued Giulio, addressing Gonelli, "that you have shown me all your instructions, and that, to the best of your knowledge, no harm is designed to me or mine."</p>
                  <p>"Upon my honor," replied the captain, "I have dealt fairly with you, and know of no evil beyond this compulsory visit to the court."</p>
                  <p>"I am satisfied, signor; lead on."</p>
                  <p>They stood without the villa, when at a signal from their leader the troop advanced from the thicket where they had been posted.</p>
                  <p>"You give me a numerous guard of honor," said Giulio.</p>
                  <p>The captain made no reply. One of the troopers led up a horse which Giulio mounted. He was then confided to the care of the lieutenant of the troop, who was ordered to commence his march.</p>
                  <p>"Remember what I told you, Tonio," he said, as he rode away.</p>
                  <p>"Ay, signor, I shall not forget it."</p>
                  <p>When they had all ridden off except the captain, he turned to the jester, and said:</p>
                  <p>"And now, my man, we'll follow."</p>
                  <p>"Ay, noble captain—I will but go and get my mule."</p>
                  <p>"Nay, you shall be better mounted," said the soldier, laying on the jester's arm that same mailed hand the weight of which he had before felt. "You shall have a seat behind me on my own good charger."</p>
                  <p>He changed his grasp to the jester's collar, and used it as an assistance in mounting his horse; then, swinging the man off his feet with an exertion of his giant strength, he placed him on the saddle.</p>
                  <p>"Now take a firm hold of my belt," said he, "for my horse is a high stepper."</p>
                  <p>Striking the rowels into his charger's flanks, the captain followed the trail of his band, the rear of which they soon overtook. Tonio was very uneasy. Daylight was approaching, and he knew that, should the Lady Estella discover the doors of the villa open and her brother gone, she would suspect foul play, and be nearly distracted at the event. He was anxious to relate the affair exactly as it stood. He could conceive no better plan than slipping quickly off the horse, even at the risk of breaking his neck, but the captain must have divined his intentions, for suddenly drawing his rein, he remarked:</p>
                  <p>"Tonio, I see you're a bad horseman, and if I don't have a care for you, you will catch a bad fall."</p>
                  <p>Thereupon this benevolent officer unbuckled his belt and passing it round both Tonio and himself, buckled it firmly, taking care to secure the jester's arms beneath the cincture.</p>
                  <p>"Now you are safe," said he, pleasantly, "and you can enjoy your ride."</p>
                  <p>In this manner, the captain silent from habit and the jester from wrath and disappointment, they rode on some miles, keeping a little in the rear of the escort. At last, after a period of time which seemed an age to the poor jester, the cavalier halted his horse and unbuckled his belt, and suffered Tonio to slide to the ground.</p>
                  <p>"Now, my friend," said the captain, "you are at liberty to return to the villa which I had forgotten your master told you not to leave. How thoughtless of me! And how sorry I am not to have a horse to offer you. It will take you full two hours to walk back. Farewell."</p>
                  <p>With this, the captain rode off sharply, leaving the jester standing in the middle of the road.</p>
                  <p>"The fiends seize you!" muttered the jester. "What a thorough knave that is. But he reckons without his host. Two hours to the villa! He little knows how fleet of foot I am. Now for it. If I die on the track, that iron-hearted hearted villain will pay for it some day or other, if there is justice anywhere."</p>
                  <p>And girding up his loins, Tonio started back at a flight of speed which justified his boasting. In less than one hour he reached the villa, panting, it is true, with his exertions, but sound in wind and limb.</p>
                  <p>It was high time. Morning had dawned, and the Signora Estella, who was the earliest riser at Monte Rosa, had already discovered the absence of her brother. Tonio encountered her on the threshold, and her first words were:</p>
                  <p>"Where is my brother? What has befallen him?"</p>
                  <p>"He is gone to Parma," gusped the jester.</p>
                  <p>"Alone?"</p>
                  <p>"No, signora. Carried off by a troop of the duke's horse. They took me half way, the villains, and then dropped me like a bad bargain, in the road."</p>
                  <p>"His life is in danger!" shricked Estella.</p>
                  <p>"Not so bad as that," answered the jester, "but his liberty perhaps."</p>
                  <p>Estella wrung her hands and burst into tears.</p>
                  <p>"Alas! alas!" she cried, "this usurping duke is destined to be the ruin of our house! But I must dry my tears, and think and act!"</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE DUCAL COURT.—A SURPRISE.</head>
                  <p>AFTER Captain Gonelli had dismissed Tonio he rode forward and joined Giulio Brigaldi, to whom he addressed a few words, but as they were answered with monosyllabic brevity, the conversation was not continued. Giulio rode on absorbed in his own thoughts. His position was somewhat anomalous. Captain Gonelli had been sent with instructions to <emph>invite</emph> him to court, but to bring him thither by force, if he were recusant. Inestimable courtesy! The aggravating circumstances of instant departure and of non-intercourse with his household, might or might not have been a subordinate assumption of power, and yet Giulio strongly suspected the duke of verbally ordering every detail of his arrest and abduction. Once or twice, when he thought of his sister, he conceived the idea of escaping by a sudden dash, but the moment he glanced at his escort, he perceived the impossibility of executing any such project. The riders were formed in a deep, compact column, in the centre of which he was placed. On his left rode Gonelli, a man of giant strength, while his lieutenant, a perfect Hercules, flanked him on the other side. He was in the centre of a moving steel fortress, a huge machine, as it were, which he could no more penetrate than he could leap through a wall of solid rock. Bitter as these reflections were to him, his high spirit came to his aid, and he resolved to brave whatever might befall him with a courage worthy of his blood.</p>
                  <p>It was broad day when Captain Gonelli answered the challenge of the sentinel at the gate he had selected for his entrance to the city and rode within the walls. Clattering over the stones the troop trotted through the streets, approached the palace and entered by a broad gateway the vast enclosure formed by the quadrangular pile.</p>
                  <p>A few persons were sauntering about the courtyard. The first that Giulio recognized, expecting indeed to see no one he knew, was Ferrado. The latter rushed forward, aided him to alight and shook hands with him with unfeigned cordiality.</p>
                  <p>"My dear cousin," said the master of horse, "you are the very last person I expected to see here! Has the duke rescinded his order of banishment, and have you tired so soon of solitude?"</p>
                  <p>"I am here by invitation of the duke," answered Giulio, bitterly. "He was so bent on my company that he would not take no for an answer—would not even give me time to make preparations for my journey—and you see what a splendid escort he has given me!"</p>
                  <p>Gonelli beckoned Ferrado out of car-shot, and they whispered together very earnestly for a few moments. At last Ferrado returned to his relation's side, the horses of the troopers were led off to their stables, and the officers repaired to their barracks.</p>
                  <p>"Do you mean to tell me, Ferrado, that you knew nothing of my arrest?" asked Giulio.</p>
                  <p>"Nothing, upon my honor, nor can I conjecture what the duke's intentions are with regard to you. Gonelli has just given me verbal instructions to attend to your wants, and to present you to the duke."</p>
                  <p>"I am glad he has given me so gentlemanly a jailer at least."</p>
                  <p>"Don't persist in calling yourself a prisoner. The duke may intend to open a brilliant career to you, in atonement for his error and neglect in the past. But, in the meantime, come to my apartments."</p>
                  <p>"Ferrado!" said the young man, "this Parma I revisit has changed from the city I remember—the city of my heart. The same palaces,<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7296-00000012"/> the same villas, the same fountains, and the same gardens meet my eye—but the population of the streets is different. Not in my father's time were troops of male and female mendicants, in sordid rags, hollow-eyed, man and sickly, seen moving through the streets."</p>
                  <p>"They are disgusting objects, these beggars," answered Ferrado, "they are eyesores—they must be removed from the public way."</p>
                  <p>"Better remove the poverty," answered Giulio, as they entered the palace.</p>
                  <p>The apartments of the equerry were sumptuously furnished. Gilded chairs covered with three-pile Genoa velvet, were arranged around the walls, on which hung huge Venetian mirrors and pictures, while silver branches holding wax candles were profusely introduced.</p>
                  <p>"What do you think of a prince who lodges his subjects in this style?" said Ferrado, pointing out this magnificence to the attention of his guest.</p>
                  <p>"I should rather see plain furniture in the palace, and fewer rags in the streets."</p>
                  <p>"Pooh! still harping on the beggars! The priests tell us that the poor are always with us."</p>
                  <p>"And so we must seek to increase poverty! Admirable logic!"</p>
                  <p>"I have no disposition to discuss political economy with you, Signor Philosopher, but had much rather discuss a good breakfast which is waiting for us in the next room. Will you honor my repast by sharing it?"</p>
                  <p>Giulio had half a mind not to break bread in the palace of the duke, but an instant's reflection taught him the absurdity of such a proceeding, and to say the truth, his ride had given him a keen appetite. He accordingly sat down with Ferrado in the next room, and did ample justice to his cheer. When the repast was over, Ferrado showed him his wardrobe.</p>
                  <p>"There," said he, "take your choice of these dresses; they are new and will fit you. How will you array yourself for presentation to the duke? Here's a suit of blue and silver. Or do you prefer one of purple velvet and gold? Suit your fancy."</p>
                  <p>"I thank you, Ferrado," answered Giulio, coldly. "When I have cleansed the travel stains from my own dress, I shall be sufficiently presentable. I do not wish to appear in the borrowed plumage of a courtier."</p>
                  <p>"As you please," replied the equerry, a little piqued at the refusal.</p>
                  <p>Yet the manly beauty of Giulio's face and figure needed no adventitious aid from dress. His plain, dark suit well became his person, which was both elastic and muscular, and when he had completed the arrangements of his costume, even Ferrado could not help envying his appearance, notwithstanding the simplicity of his apparel, though he himself blazed with purple velvet, embroidery, lace, gold, jewels and plumes.</p>
                  <p>At last an usher appeared to conduct Ferrado and his companion to the presence of the duke. They passed up a long marble staircase and reached a spacious ante-chamber, lines with the steel-clad halberdiers of the ducal guard. Thence they were ushered into a magnificent saloon, the frescoed ceiling of which was supported by a double row of Corinthian pillars of cream-colored marble, while ladies and courtiers crowding the floor in dazzling array, gave it the appearance of a brilliant flower garden, and dazzled the eye of the spectator. On a marble platform raised above the level of the floor, on a carved and gilded throne overhung with a canopy of crimson velvet, richly embroidered with gold, sat the Duke of Parma, in his splendid robes.</p>
                  <p>But Giulio was unmoved by this display. He moved towards the throne with a firm and elastic step, and a serene countenance, and respectfully paid his obeisance to the sovereign. The duke arose, and descending to meet him, took his hand.</p>
                  <p>"Nephew," said he, while the courtiers fell back to a respectful distance, so that the interview was in a measure private, "it is a long time since we have met."</p>
                  <p>"That was not entirely my fault, my liege," replied Giulio.</p>
                  <p>"It is needless to remind us of that," said the duke, a slight shade of color mantling his usually pallid cheek. "I trust your ride from Monte Rosa did not fatigue you too much."</p>
                  <p>"I am a hunter and hardened by the exertions of the chase. But I was hurried hither somewhat rudely."</p>
                  <p>"What! did Gonelli dare affront a relation of mine? He shall pay dearly for it," said the duke, with affected anger.</p>
                  <p>"Nay, my lord, he did but follow out the spirit of your orders, which he showed me."</p>
                  <p>The duke bit his lip.</p>
                  <p>"The change of scene must appear striking to you," he resumed after a few minutes' silence. "Do you not think we are worthy to sustain the honors of our station? There is no ducal court that is said to surpass ours in magnificence."</p>
                  <p>"I should appreciate it better, my lord," replied Giulio, "had I not witnessed so much misery in the street. In my humble judgment, the true glory of a ruler lies in the comfort of his people."</p>
                  <p>"Giulio, you were born for a courtier," said the duke, ironically.</p>
                  <p>"I was born to utter my free thoughts as they sprung from my heart to my lips," replied the young man.</p>
                  <p>"You are not unlike your father—my poor, poor brother!" said the duke. "You have grown up his very image," he added, gazing keenly upon his nephew; "the very figure, air, voice and sentiments! They tell," he continued, after a pause, "that you are wedded to a rural life."</p>
                  <p>"They have informed you truly, my lord," replied Giulio. "Nothing can tempt me to abandon it. I have had, indeed, to be frank with you, ambitious dreams at times, but I am satisfied they were only idle illusions, and that my heart is at Monte Rosa."</p>
                  <p>"Nay," said the duke, in a tone of affected kindness, "you have no right to bury yourself in obscurity, your talents deserve another sphere."</p>
                  <p>"I am content," replied Giulio. "And the more so, since I have again witnessed with my own eyes, the hollow splendors of high station."</p>
                  <p>"Nephew," said the duke, "I wish to make friends with you. I propose to attach you to our person; to give you rank, splendid apparel, fortune! What say you to the offer?"</p>
                  <p>"That I respectfully decline it, my lord. It would not add to my happiness, nor is it in my power to do you service."</p>
                  <p>"I am not used," said the duke, in a tone of vexation, "to have my good offices rejected. But if you imagine you cannot serve me, you are mistaken. What say you to a commission in my guards?"</p>
                  <p>"The rank has no temptation for me. We live in a period of peace. It would vex my soul to command a guard of honor; day after day to go through the same dull routine, to marshal a band of idle men, to be the director of a mere court pageant. I could not endure it."</p>
                  <p>"Yet the profession of arms," said the duke, "is usually tempting to a young man of spirit."</p>
                  <p>"Ay, when the war-trumpet wakes the land," replied Giulio, fire flashing from his eyes. "Were the state menaced, were my country in danger, then I would not wait for rank and emolument to win me to your service. If not otherwise, then, forgetful and disdainful of rank, I would enter the ranks as a volunteer, asking nothing but where I might meet the enemy. But O, I feel the temptation—the intoxication of a command in time of war. I know how glorious it must be, at the head of a gallant band of lunces, to hurl destruction on the foe—to carry the colors of your country into the heart of the enemy's array, to raise the shout of victory upon the hard-fought field, or even to die in achieving it, with that shout ringing in your ears."</p>
                  <p>At this moment, the crimson drapery behind them parted, and a beautiful woman, splendidly attired, her countenance flushed with warm color, her eyes shaming the diamonds that blazed upon her person, advanced upon the platform. Giulio stood transfixed as this radiant vision burst upon his sight. He had recognized, with astonishment, the lady of the fairies' glen.</p>
                  <p>"Margarita—daughter—" said the duke,"this is Giulio, your cousin."</p>
                  <p>The lady, trembling and blushing, extended her hand. Giulio knelt, and with a hand that trembled also, raised hers to his lips, and imprinted thereon a respectful kiss of homage.</p>
                  <p>"We have met before," murmured the princess to her father.</p>
                  <p>"How? where?" cried the duke.</p>
                  <p>"At the hunting party in the forest. Our brave young kinsman saved my life."</p>
               </div>
               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE PRINCESS MARGARITA.</head>
                  <p>THE duke was surprised when he learned from the lips of his daughter the fact that it was her cousin who had rendered her such important assistance on the occasion of her accident on the day of the hunting party. Secretly he was displeased with the occurrence, but he could do no less than thank Giulio in warm terms, which contrasted, however, with the coldness of his tone and expression, for the service he had rendered. After thus expressing himself, he retired with the Princess Margarita, leaving the young man bewildered and yet pleasantly excited by the unexpected meeting.</p>
                  <p>Ferrado came up to him, and affected to congratulate him warmly.</p>
                  <p>"Bravo, kinsman," said he, "your fortune is made. You have placed our duke under the deepest obligations. He cannot do too much to repay you. Either as courtier or soldier, a brilliant<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7296-00000013"/> liant career lies before you. Why man!" he added, "how thoughtful and absent-minded you appear. What are you thinking of?"</p>
                  <p>"Of Monte Rosa," replied Giulio.</p>
                  <p>"You are perfectly incorrigible," said Ferrado.</p>
                  <p>At this moment, a beautiful young page made his appearance, and approached Giulio.</p>
                  <p>"You will please to follow me, signor," said he.</p>
                  <p>"And pray, young sir, whom have I the honor of addressing?" asked Giulio.</p>
                  <p>"Hush!" whispered Ferrado. "He is Selim, the Princess Margarita's page."</p>
                  <p>"Lead on, sir," said Giulio, before the boy had time to reply to his question, and they retired together.</p>
                  <p>"He loves her!" thought Ferrado. "Loves the woman whom the duke hinted was not too high for my aspirations. Does she love him? He has saved her life. The princess is romantic. But the duke—what will he do? Will he seek to disarm Giulio's enmity by favoring the alliance? Yet the maid of Monte Rosa is fairer in my eyes, and that brief interview I had with her was fraught with fascination. I am tossed by conflicting passions—love, ambition—and know not which to choose. Time will decide."</p>
                  <p>In the mean time Giulio had followed the elastic step of his youthful guide, until the latter opened a door, and passing the threshold, he again stood in the presence of the lovely princess. If she had looked beautiful in the lonely forest green—if fairest of the fair in the brilliant circle of the court, her loveliness was still more dazzling now that she sat alone, in a sumptuous dress that enhanced her charms, and in an apartment where the colors of the drapery were artfully contrived to give the fullest effect to her attractions. Yet there was an air of conscious dignity which awed the beholder and checked the current of his youthful blood. With an imposing gesture, she dismissed her attendant, and beckoned her cousin to approach.</p>
                  <p>"I little thought," she said, calmly, and as if acquitting herself of a duty, "that I should so soon meet you again, and to repeat my thanks for the inappreciable service that you rendered me."</p>
                  <p>"It was a service I would have rendered any one in your situation," replied Giulio; "a mere act of humanity; but for you, I would have qraved a still greater peril."</p>
                  <p>The princess inclined her head to the compliment, but with little animation in her manner.</p>
                  <p>"I learn," she said, "that you visit Parma at my father's invitation."</p>
                  <p>Giulio could not help smiling.</p>
                  <p>"I indeed received a very pressing invitation from your father, lady," he replied. "He was so very anxious to see me, that he sent a troop of horse to bring me; and his messenger, the captain of his guard, made me rise from my bed to accompany him."</p>
                  <p>"But you were not harshly treated on your arrival?"</p>
                  <p>"Nay; presented at court, the duke offered to attach me to his person, to give me rank in his army."</p>
                  <p>"And you answered him—"</p>
                  <p>"That I preferred the peaceful shades of Monte Rosa."</p>
                  <p>"The life of a hermit, rather than the life of a man!" said the princess, sarcastically.</p>
                  <p>"The life of a philosopher, a painter, a poet, an agriculturist; is there baseness in the choice?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes; when a nobler career is open to you," replied the princess.</p>
                  <p>"How nobler?" said Giulio. "Is it nobler to flaunt in silk and velvet, with the idle minions of the court? Is it nobler to wear a useless sword, and grace an idle pageant as a carpet-knight?"</p>
                  <p>"But peace cannot always endure," said the princess.</p>
                  <p>"You have not studied the position of Parma," replied Giulio. "She is weaker than the surrounding states."</p>
                  <p>"Then why not seek a state which will give you an opportunity to win your spurs?"</p>
                  <p>"That opportunity has offered."</p>
                  <p>"And you have refused it?" said the princess.</p>
                  <p>"I have refused it."</p>
                  <p>"Are you incapable of a daring enterprise?"</p>
                  <p>"I know one happiness which I would give worlds to reach; a prize worthy the best efforts of my heart and hand," he said, meaningly, as he fixed his dark eyes on the princess.</p>
                  <p>"You will never attain any lofty aim," said the princess hurriedly, as the color mounted to her cheek, "unless you boldly venture. I counsel you to accept my father's offer. At least reflect on it; I am going this moment to seek him, and shall perhaps return with him. Remain here—reflect on what I have said."</p>
                  <p>"She taunts me with baseness," said Giulio, as he paced the apartment. "Yet Heaven knows I do not deserve it. I love her—and I feel that this passion, the birth of a moment, has become a part of my life. Yet to win her can I not accept cept rank and employment at her father's hand; the hand of a usurper. So long as I deemed him a worthy ruler, I could acquiesce in his possession of the ducal coronet that is mine of right. But now that my own eyes have witnessed his lavish prodigality, the misery that crowds the streets of my native city, the arbitrary character of this man, my soul rebels against longer inaction. The Duke of Milan, my father's friend and mine, has offered me his aid to regain my rights and depose the usurper. I will not harm a hair of his head, but I will reduce him to the rank from which he rose. <emph>He</emph> become <emph>my</emph> patron! He shall live to do me homage, to acknowledge his wrongs to his own blood, before the world."</p>
                  <p>At this moment a light step entered the apartment. It was the princess's page. He looked cautiously around him, then came close up to Giulio, and laying his hand upon his arm, uttered a single word in a low tone:</p>
                  <p>"Danger!"</p>
                  <p>"Did the princess send you to me?"</p>
                  <p>The boy shook his head, and smiled disdainfully.</p>
                  <p>"I came of my own accord."</p>
                  <p>"Speak out then, and explain yourself."</p>
                  <p>"You are in danger, signor."</p>
                  <p>"I am always in danger at the court of Francisco Veroni."</p>
                  <p>"Do you prize liberty?"</p>
                  <p>"More dearly than life."</p>
                  <p>"Then fly!"</p>
                  <p>"That were the part of cowardice—and from an unknown danger."</p>
                  <p>"Hear me!" said the boy, hurriedly. "I have played the eavesdropper; and I know that the duke means to arrest you presently and cast you into a dungeon."</p>
                  <p>"Ha!" cried Giulio. "Is he capable of such treachery?"</p>
                  <p>"Stay not to reflect on my words, but fly!"</p>
                  <p>"I have no means of escape."</p>
                  <p>"Follow me, and quickly," said the page. "I will give you an Arab steed, fleet as the wind. I can guide you past the sentinels and the guards at the city gate. This way, stop not to consider."</p>
                  <p>The earnestness of the boy, the frankness of his manner and expression, banished all scruples from Giulio's mind. He motioned his youthful friend to lead the way. The boy directed him to the door by which Giulio had entered, and threw it open.</p>
                  <p>Two spearmen posted in the corridor, levelled their weapons at his breast. The page hastily closed the door, and was retracing his steps, accompanied by Giulio, when directly opposite them appeared Gonellie, with a file of dismounted troopers.</p>
                  <p>"I arrest you!" said the soldier.</p>
                  <p>"In whose name?" said Giulio, drawing his sword.</p>
                  <p>"In the name of the Duke of Parma!"</p>
                  <p>"I deny your authority."</p>
                  <p>"Disarm the rebel!" cried the duke, suddenly appearing.</p>
                  <p>"Rebel!" exclaimed Giulio, as the soldiers wrenched the weapon from his hand. "Thou art the rebel. The armed ruffians that do your bidding make not your right. My right is the blood that flows in my veins, and that you know full well, usurper."</p>
                  <p>"You shall utter your lofty apostrophes to stone walls," said the duke. "Away with him to the dungeon!"</p>
                  <p>"You have entrapped me like a coward!" cried Giulio. "Your minions surprised me in my bed. Yet this very morning you spoke me fair. Lately I saved your daughter's life—is this your gratitude?"</p>
                  <p>"I will hear no more!" said the duke, stamping furiously. "Remove the prisoner."</p>
                  <p>"Think not," said Giulio, "that this outrage can be perpetrated with impunity. Think not I am friendless. Milan is near to Parma. And when this news reaches her brave duke, who, but for me, would long ago have thundered at your gates, he will summon his brave lances to the rescue, and they will flock hither to award stern justice."</p>
                  <p>"They may come too late for you," said the duke, with a sinister look.</p>
                  <p>"But not too late to avenge me," retorted Giulio.</p>
                  <p>"I cannot hear my noble master abused thus!" cried the page. "Gonelli, why do you not close the ruffian's mouth?"</p>
                  <p>"I thank you, boy," said the duke.</p>
                  <p>"I was aware," said Giulio, "that I had no friends in this accursed place. Lead me to prison, then," he added, addressing the captain, "a dungeon is preferable to the presence of this crowned villain."</p>
                  <p>At this moment the Princess Margarita appeared. The guard paused a moment to present arms, and Giulio took the opportunity to address her.</p>
                  <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7296-00000014"/>
                  <p>"To you, lady," he said, howing with mock humility, "I am indebted for the fair lodging to which your father has consigned me. It was at your bidding I came hither. While I was listening to your fair words, your noble father was planning my arrest."</p>
                  <p>"Answer him not," said the duke, peremptorily, addressing his daughter. "He is beneath your indignation. He will have time enough to reflect upon his threats and the charges he has uttered, in his cell."</p>
                  <p>Giulio folded his arms in proud disdain, and without uttering another word, followed Gonelli, while the armed troop closed around him. They passed into a corridor, and after traversing a long gallery came to an iron door, which was opened on a summons from the captain, admitting the party upon the landing-place of a long flight of stone steps. These they descended, and came to another iron door which was opened by a stern, gray-haired man, dressed in a shirt of leather and wearing a bunch of huge keys at his girdle.</p>
                  <p>"Matteo," said the captain, "behold your prisoner."</p>
                  <p>The jailer smiled grimly, and bowing with mock courtesy to Giulio, said:</p>
                  <p>"This way, noble signor, this way. I am only too proud to wait upon your lordship."</p>
                  <p>Giulio followed his new guide, while the soldiers returned to the palace.</p>
                  <p>"To a gentleman fond of retirement," said the jailer, with a sardonic smile, "this place offers a pleasant, agreeable retreat; easy of access, though not so easy of egress."</p>
                  <p>While he spoke he put one of the keys in the lock of a low door, and the bolt shot back with a jarring sound. He then ushered his visitor into a small cell, dimly lighted, where there were a pallet bed, a stone bench, a water jug and a table.</p>
                  <p>"You would find it much cooler," said the jailer, "if you wore irons on your wrists and ankles, but it seems the duke did not order these additions to your comfort."</p>
                  <p>"Leave me, ruffian!" cried the prisoner, stung to madness by the cold, taunting tone of the jailer. "At least you were not commissioned to affront me."</p>
                  <p>Chuckling at having roused the indignation of his victim, the jailer slowly withdrew, locking the heavy door behind him, while Giulio threw himself upon the bench, a prey to agonizing thought. Heavily rolled on the hours of the morning, and it seemed to the weary prisoner as if he had passed days in the dungeon, when he was roused from his gloomy reflections by hearing the key turning in the huge lock of his cell door. His eye had now become accustomed to the light, and as the door opened, he discerned the features of Selim, Margarita's page.</p>
                  <p>"Jailer!" shouted Giulio, fiercely, "do not let that young viper enter here. I would be alone."</p>
                  <p>"Prisoners are choosers no more than beggars," replied the grim janitor, chuckling, as he withdrew, leaving the page and prisoner together.</p>
                  <p>Selim approached Giulio, and, to his surprise, fell upon his knees at his feet, burst into tears, and sobbed as if his heart would break.</p>
                  <p>"Did you come hither to perform a farce, boy?" said the prisoner, sternly. "Rise, and cease this foolery."</p>
                  <p>"Prince," said the page, "I will not rise till you forgive me for seeming to desert your cause in the princess's apartment just now. The look you gave me pierced me to the heart. Yet, sir, it gave me the acutest pain to side with your enemies; but it was done that I might have the power of serving you. The duke now reposes confidence in me, and sends me to you as a spy to win from you all your plans and hopes."</p>
                  <p>"How do I know that you are not one?" asked Giulio, though softening somewhat from his former severity of manner.</p>
                  <p>The page sprang to his feet, took the prince's hand, pressed it to his heart, and then covered it with kisses.</p>
                  <p>"I would pour out my life-blood for you," he said. "But tell me—if I succeed in procuring the means of evasion for you, will you permit me to accompany you in your flight?"</p>
                  <p>"I think not of escaping now," said the prince, "but I would give my hand for a trusty messenger to my friend and kinsman, the Duke of Milan."</p>
                  <p>"Hush!" said the page. "Speak low; prison walls have ears. Confide in me; I will be your messenger."</p>
                  <p>"Can I trust you?"</p>
                  <p>"As your other self."</p>
                  <p>"Boy! if you redeem your promise, you may rely upon my gratitude and friendship; your for tune will be made."</p>
                  <p>"I care not for fortune," said the page, "but only for your good opinion."</p>
                  <p>"Is the princess aware of your visit to me?"</p>
                  <p>A dark shade crossed the handsome face of the youth.</p>
                  <p>"She is your enemy," said he; "speak not of her."</p>
                  <p>"So fair and yet so false!" exclaimed Giulio.</p>
                  <p>"Lose no time," said the page, impatiently. "The message!"</p>
                  <p>"Go to the duke; tell of my hard case, of the treachery and enmity of the usurper; leave the rest to him."</p>
                  <p>"Consider your message as delivered," said the boy. "I bear a charmed life, and will traverse the space between here and Milan like an arrow. Sleep in peace, noble prince; the tyrant shall be foiled."</p>
                  <p>He summoned the jailer and departed, taking care, before the grim functionary, to address an insulting remark to the prisoner, to lull any suspicions the jailer might have entertained. The visit of the page was a ray of sunshine in the dungeon's gloom.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE MESSENGER.—PLANS OF GUILT.</head>
                  <p>SELIM, the princess's page, was a youth of rare beauty—a beauty of a character that might have been charged with effeminacy but for the redeeming fire of dark eyes, bright and duzzling as a fuleon's, and wild and daring in their expression. The rose and lily were blent in his complexion, and the curls that clustered on his head, were of that intense blackness which has a glittering metallic brilliancy where it catches the light. He had come to court in the train of the astrologer, and a few words of recommendation from him, secured his appointment as page to the duke's daughter. At first, he spoke but little and with difficulty, and that with a strong foreign accent, but when afterwards he had learned to speak Italian, he was scarcely more communicative, and associated little with the other youths of his own age, the pages of the duke and sons of the courtiers. He rarely stirred from the side of the princess. When she rode abroad, his horse was ever beside her bridle-rein; when she sat in her apartments, surrounded by her ladies, his place was on a cushion at her feet, either playing some plaintive air on his guitar, or reading to her from a favorite volume. Yet for all this, he possessed a sufficiency of manly spirit. He brooked no insult—at the shadow of one, the color would rush to his cheek, and his hand sought his dagger hilt instantly. Then he rode with grace and fearlessness; no one but himself dared back Abdallah, the dapple Arabian appropriated to his use. Yet the desert-born would obey the lightest whisper of the page, and whenever he approached to mount him, that half-wild horse, the terror of the grooms, would express his delight with a neigh, and gently stoop his head for the expected caress.</p>
                  <p>Such was the youth who now sought the ducal stables, and quietly directed a serving man to saddle his Arab. Springing on the back of the priceless animal, Selim then, by unfrequented streets, gained one of the city gates, and passing the guard unchallenged, rode moderately forth. It was only when he found himself beyond the reach of curious eyes, that he ventured to mend his pace.</p>
                  <p>"Now, Abdallah!" said he, addressing his horse, "desert child of a desert sire—offspring of fire and wind—show thy blood and breeding, for thy master has sore need of them. Hearest thou, Abdallah? One lieth in a dungeon yonder—beautiful, brave, unfortunate, the least hair of whose head is worth a thousand of thy race. So now, Abdallah, stretch thy beautiful limbs, and fly with me likes the arrow to the target. Away!"</p>
                  <p>It really seemed as if the intelligent animal understood the language of his master. Snorting joyously, he stretched himself like a greyhound, and sprang at once into his swiftest gallop. His footfalls were as rapid as the pattering of raindrops in a summer shower. Horse and rider moved in unison and seemed animated by the same spirit. The wind sung by them—the trees danced past—the ground disappeared, as if the velocity of the earth were suddenly made manifest; up hill and down hill spend the matchless gray, never once faltering, each stroke of his gallop being as clearly executed and vigorous as when he started on his race. And still the page encouraged him by word and rein. Mile after mile was thus passed in an incredibly short space of time.</p>
                  <p>At last Abdallah slackened in his speed—changed from a gallop to a eanter, then dropped into a walk, and came to a full stand-still. It was not weariness, for he erected his head, and after listening intently for a moment, with his small, delicate cars pointing forward, uttered a loud, clarion neigh.</p>
                  <p>"What is it, Abdallah?" said the page.</p>
                  <p>The horse tossed his head playfully and resumed his gallop with redoubled ardor. The page now entered a deep chestnut wood, where the road wound, broad and level, through the cool shadows.</p>
                  <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7296-00000015"/>
                  <p>All at once Selim heard a sound of horses' feet approaching, which the quick ear of his Arabian had detected long before, and presently there came sweeping towards him, round a turn in the road, a file of horsemen in bright armor, preceded by an officer of gallant bearing, who wore his beaver up, displaying a frank, handsome and determined face. As soon as this person saw the page, he reined in his horse; and obeying a command, uttered in a low tone, his men came into line and occupied the entire breadth of the road with a close front.</p>
                  <p>"Sir knight," said the page, "I am in great haste—on a message of life and death. I pray thee stay me not, but give me passage."</p>
                  <p>"Not so, fair sir," replied the stranger, "till I know whence thou comest and whither thou art going."</p>
                  <p>"You are hardly courteous," said the page.</p>
                  <p>"And yet I care not to conceal that I come from Parma, and am hastening to Milan."</p>
                  <p>"To Milan!"</p>
                  <p>"Ay, signor; with a message to the duke."</p>
                  <p>"You will not have far to ride then," said the stranger, "and I myself will be your escort."</p>
                  <p>He whispered a few words to a subaltern officer, and the horsemen, breaking their line, resumed their march leaving part of the broad road free.</p>
                  <p>The commander of this little party then wheeled his horse, and he and Selim galloped on together, leaving the soldiers to pursue their march. But few words were exchanged between the riders, until reaching the brow of a hill, they emerged from the forest, and the road stoped down from the high table land they had been traversing, into a wide, open plain.</p>
                  <p>What was the astonishment of Selim to find it covered with a large army. In the centre of the plain was a group of tents, over one of which floated an emblazoned banner, while horses were picketted round it, and men-at-arms marching to and fro, flung back the sunbeams from their glittering appointments. Dark masses of troops extended on the right and left.</p>
                  <p>"What is the meaning of this warlike array?" asked the page, in astonishment.</p>
                  <p>"That is a question which the duke alone can answer," replied his companion, with a smile.</p>
                  <p>"O, lead me to him at once!" cried the page, impatiently.</p>
                  <p>"That I should have done without your asking," replied the officer, as they rode forward once more.</p>
                  <p>A few moments brought them to the front of a magnificent silken tent, the head-quarters of the army. Leaving Selim sitting on his horse, the guide dismounted and entered the tent. After a few moments, he reappeared, and told Selim that he might enter.</p>
                  <p>The boy complied with the invitation, and soon stood in the presence of the Duke of the Milanese. He was a man in the prime of life, with a frank, handsome face, and sitting in a loose robe on a couch of velvet. The page saluted him and waited for him to speak.</p>
                  <p>"What is your name, my lad?"</p>
                  <p>"Selim, my lord."</p>
                  <p>"You are a page, by your habit. In whose service are you?"</p>
                  <p>"In that of the most noble lady, Margarita, Princess of Parma."</p>
                  <p>"We have heard of that peerless lady," replied the duke; "any commands of hers will be respectfully received."</p>
                  <p>"But I come not from her, my lord."</p>
                  <p>"Not from the duke, I trust," said the sovereign of Milan, a frown darkening his handsome countenance.</p>
                  <p>"No, my lord—but from one of his victims—a prisoner in the ducal dungeons."</p>
                  <p>"Ha!" cried the duke, "his name?"</p>
                  <p>"Giulio Brigaldi is the name he bears," answered the page. "But his rightful name is Giulio Veroni."</p>
                  <p>"Boy!" cried the duke, vehemently, "if you have deceived me in this matter, a short shrift and a long halter shall be your reward. Is Giulio in the hands of the usurper?"</p>
                  <p>"He is, my lord."</p>
                  <p>"How came he in Parma?"</p>
                  <p>"He was arrested at midnight in his villa, and brought to the city. At first the duke plied him with fair words, but he was suddenly seized and thrown into a dungeon. The duke suspected not my sympathy, and hence I gained access to the noble prisoner. He bade me inform you of his position and beg your aid in his sore distress."</p>
                  <p>"Swear," said the duke, holding up a crucifix before the page, "swear by this holy sign, that you have spoken the truth."</p>
                  <p>"I swear it," said the boy, reverently, and touching the cross with his lips.</p>
                  <p>"Then I have taken the field not a moment too soon," cried the duke. "The martial array you have witnessed was intended as a demonstration against Parma. I was on the march thither with a thousand lances at my back, and heavy artillery to boot, to demand the restoration of Giulio's heritage. And now he is you villain's prisoner. Go back, boy—go back as fast as horse can carry you, and tell Giulio that ere many hours my trumpets shall be ringing at the gates of Parma. If the usurper dare to harm a hair of his head, he shall swing like a felon from the battlements of his own city. Go—yet stay; you have ridden on the spur hither, have you not?"</p>
                  <p>"Ay, my lord."</p>
                  <p>"Then your horse must be jaded. Leave him. You shall have the fleetest horse in camp."</p>
                  <p>The page smiled.</p>
                  <p>"Abdallah and I are too good friends to be parted," replied he. "And he is fresh and strong as though he had not galloped a mile. And for fleetness—he has not his match in Italy."</p>
                  <p>"Away then, in Heaven's name!" said the duke, "and I will follow with my utmost speed."</p>
                  <p>The page bowed and retired from the tent. In a moment he was mounted and riding swiftly out of camp, accompanied by the same officer who had been his escort thither. His guide rode with him till they had passed the farthest videttes, and then bade him adieu.</p>
                  <p>Abdallah needed no urging. He flew rather than galloped over the surface of the ground, and soon the towers of Parma appeared close at hand. Selim halted in a little skirt of wood, beside a babbling stream, and dismounting, washed the foam and dust from his horse's flanks, and waited till he was cool and dry—the work of a few moments only, for the hardy steed of the desert had suffered little from the ride. This precaution taken, the page again mounted, and rode into the city as carelessly and calmly as if he had been just riding out for exercise.</p>
                  <p>About this time, the Duke of Parma was closeted with Magnus the astrologer, in the apartments of the latter.</p>
                  <p>"Your science, then," said the duke, in continuation of their train of remark, "has made you as familiar with those subtle poisons which destroy life, as with those wonderful elixirs which promote and prolong it?"</p>
                  <p>"Ay, my lord," replied the astrologer. "I understand the compounding of deadly substances, and have brought with me from the East, ingredients known only to those adepts who have derived their lore from the ancient sages and magicians. In Egypt I have seen a light finger-ring, with a secret hollow that contains a single drop of poison. That single drop of poison—tasteless, colorless, has the property of instantly destroying life. The man who should swallow it would instantly fall a lifeless corpse, annihilated as by lightning. Medical skill would vainly search the frame to discover the cause of death, and would conclude it to be the effect of a sudden dispensation of Providence."</p>
                  <p>"It is wonderful!" said the duke.</p>
                  <p>"There are other poisons," said the astrologer, calmly, "which do their work with equal certainty, though their operation is slow. I know of one, a few drops of which may be administered in any liquid without awakening suspicion by its flavor. He who drinks it is doomed. Thence-forth the world begins to fade before him. His check grows gradually pale, his eye loses its lustre and its power, his hearing is impaired, his blood turns to ice and water in his veins, his frame is bowed, his hair is bleached, food does not nourish him nor wine sustain him, his bones become brittle as glass, and finally he sinks into the grave, though dead to all intents and purposes long before the breath has left his body. This poison is for the use of those to whom vengeance is a luxury, who love to gloat over the prolonged misery of their victims. The impatient heir asks for the quick poison—the epicure of vengeance for the slowly-working weapon."</p>
                  <p>"I would kill," said the duke, hoarsely. "But I would slay speedily—at once. But there must be no trace of my work. Can you aid me?"</p>
                  <p>"Will you reward me?" said the astrologer, in a low whisper.</p>
                  <p>"Ay—with an unsparing hand."</p>
                  <p>"But I must know the subject my art is to deal with."</p>
                  <p>"I will tell you all," replied the duke. "I will repose entire confidence in you. The man against whom you warned me, is now within my grasp—lying in a cell of my prison-house."</p>
                  <p>"Giulio Veroni?"</p>
                  <p>"Giulio Veroni."</p>
                  <p>"The heir to the throne of Parma?"</p>
                  <p>"Ay. There is no safety for me while he lives. Yet I dare not put him to death—he has too many friends and allies. <emph>He must die a natural death.</emph> Do you understand me?"</p>
                  <p>"Perfectly."</p>
                  <p>"You are interested in this catastrophe as well as myself. While he lives there is yet a chance of his recovering his rights. In case of his success, what becomes of you? Think you he would retain you at his court? Never—for he is one of those fools, who, wise in their own<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC7296-00000016"/> science, laugh at the lore of the stars—one of those who despise all secret dealings, and act their will in the broad face of day. He would drive you from Parma—nay, more, he would probably confiscate your wealth!"</p>
                  <p>"My wealth!" cried the astrologer. "I have none, I am poor. All your bounty is consumed in the costly pursuit of the occult sciences—in the search for the philosopher's stone; in the which if I succeed, my noble patron will be wealthier than Solomon. I am poor—I am poor."</p>
                  <p>"Be it so. Then he will put an end to your pursuit of the occult sciences. Now you understand your position, will you furnish me with the means of ridding myself of this enemy—speedily, at one stroke?"</p>
                  <p>"I am not by trade a poisoner," said the astrologer. "I must be largely bribed to do that at which my soul revolts. You must give me the means of bribing priests, of enriching altars, of purchasing salvation—and it is expensive in these hard times."</p>
                  <p>"You know me," said the duke. "My largesses shall exceed your wildest expectations."</p>
                  <p>"I will do it," said the astrologer, setting his teeth and drawing his breath hard.</p>
                  <p>"Enough. Have you the ingredients for compounding that swift poison that you spoke of?"</p>
                  <p>"I have—but it will take some time to compound it. It is a difficult and dangerous process."</p>
                  <p>"Set about it then at once," said the duke. "By nightfall it must be in my possession."</p>
                  <p>"You shall have it, noble duke. And my reward?"</p>
                  <p>"It shall be yours—fear not. Farewell."</p>
                  <p>He rose, as did the astrologer. The latter followed his patron to the outer door, cringing obsequiously till he was alone in his mystic chamber. Then he drew himself up to his full height and paced the apartment with long strides.</p>
                  <p>"I shall be rich—I shall be rich!" he cried, in an exulting tone, tossing his arms aloft. "But not for myself do I covet the red gold and sparkling gems. Zelic—child of my heart—daughter of the loveliest of Circassia's children, she shall be the pride of the world in magnificence as well as beauty. She has served me faithfully, at once my slave and daughter; but she has won my entire heart. We will not live here. We will go to the far East; I will build a palace on the banks of the Ganges. Its minarets shall point to heaven and their golden crescents shall be studded with diamonds. And deep—deep in the bowels of the earth will I build me a treasure house that shall be ever full. I know where the river sand is full of gold. I know of valleys where the diamonds are sown thick. We will have horsemen, and slaves, and camels and troops of elephants. My daughter shall be mated with an eastern prince—and for me, I shall discover—I have approached the threshold of discovery—the elixir of life, and I and mine shall enjoy perpetual youth. This it is to have a fool for a patron. The poison! I told him not that it is already prepared, ready to do its office on any enemy of mine."</p>
                  <p>Lifting a small jar from a shelter, he carefully took therefrom a few drops of a colorless liquid which he put in a small phial that stood upon a table, and then replaced the larger vessel. As he turned away after the completion of his task, a clear, musical voice, yet thrilling withal, uttered these emphatic words:</p>
                  <p>"Thou shalt do no murder!"</p>
               </div>
               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE ASTROLOGER'S DAUGHTER.</head>
                  <p>THE astrologer turned as that voice fell upon his ear. His expression, at first dismayed and confused, changed to one of the sunniest delight; his eyes moistened, his lips, his whole frame trembled, and he stretched forth his arms in the direction of the voice, as, gliding from behind a mass of drapery that concealed her, a woman of dazzling beauty, in all the glory of youth, stood before him. She wore a turban on her head, from which, fastened by a diamond of prodigious size, which blazed like a star, fell a parted veil of gold tissue to her very feet. A tunic of azure blue silk, with loose, hanging sleeves was girt to her slender waist by a cincture of diamonds and amethysts. She wore very loose trowsers of rosecolored silk, and her blue-veined, high-arched instep, guiltless of any covering, was seen as her foot entered the embroidered Persian slipper. Such was the dazzling creature who stood before the astrologer, and whom he sought to clasp to his heart. But she avoided his embrace with a shudder.</p>
                  <p>"Wouldst thou sell thy very soul for gold?" said the maiden, with indignant emphasis.</p>
                  <p>"Nay, nay—Zelie; what are these Christians other than dogs, that we should shrink from ridding ourselves of them without compunction? It is but an animal less in the world—but to me one stride nearer the end."</p>
                  <p>"And that end?"</p>
                  <p>"Thy happiness, my daughter—thy joy, my delight—thy greatness, light of my eyes—star of my existence—thou, memory of the past, hope of the future."</p>
                  <p>"Father," said the beautiful girl, drawing nearer to the astrologer, and no longer shunning his embrace, "I know that you love me, idolize me, all unworthy as I am."</p>
                  <p>"And I will make you happy, Zelie. You shall mate with a prince."</p>
                  <p>"I love a prince."</p>
                  <p>"You!" exclaimed the astrologer, in astonishment.</p>
                  <p>"Ay—father. A noble I have seen at this court."</p>
                  <p>"It cannot be the Duke of Parma!"</p>
                  <p>"It should be the Duke of Parma."</p>
                  <p>"Francisco Veroni?"</p>
                  <p>"No! Giulio Veroni—the rightful heir to the throne."</p>
                  <p>"It cannot be!" said the astrologer, trembling with excitement. "You have not dared to fix your affections on that man."</p>
                  <p>"Have you not often told me, father, that we cannot fix our affections—that they are decided by fate? Have you not told me that two souls destined for each other, coalesce the moment they approach each other?"</p>
                  <p>"But this Giulio has but to-day arrived at court. Scarce arrived he was arrested and thrown into a dungeon."</p>
                  <p>"He has been here long enough. To see him was to love him. He was the realization of my maiden dreams. My page's disguise, which I assumed, you know how reluctantly, to favor your enterprise, to obtain you information and enable you to play your part successfully, allowed me to see him as I might not have done had I worn the garb of my sex. I know the nobility of his soul equals the perfection of his form and face. I sought him in his dungeon, and became his messenger; I would have undertaken for his sake to go to the end of the world. I carried a message for him to the Duke of Milan."</p>
                  <p>"Zelie! Zelie!" cried the astrologer, wringing his hands, "you have ruined me. But go on—did you see the duke?"</p>
                  <p>"I saw him. He is approaching Parma in arms at the head of a powerful force."</p>
                  <p>"Instantly will I apprize my master. Mad girl! you know not what you have done. Our fortunes—perhaps our lives hang on the breath of the reigning duke. If he falls, we are driven hence—branded as charlatans, impostors—enemies of the state—stripped of our treasure—turned adrift upon the world without a ducat."</p>
                  <p>"Nay, father; I hope more from the kindness of Giulio than from the caprice of Duke Francisco."</p>
                  <p>"You know nothing of him; you are bewitched—enchanted; you are blighted by the evil spirit. O, Zelie! it was a fatal hour when you saw this youth."</p>
                  <p>"Father!" cried the girl, passionately, "hear me—I love him; you have consented to give the duke the means of destroying his life, and too well I know your fatal skill. Now hear me—and obey me, or even you, my father, shall incur my deadly hatred. If you have labored for me, I have in turn labored for you. We are partners in imposture. To please you, I have laid aside the garments of my sex—crushed the sensitive feelings of a woman's nature—been the slave of a woman's caprice—the companion of men with whom I could not sympathize. I demand some requital. I can love but once—I have fixed my affections on this man whose life you seek—a man who has never wronged you. Spare him for my sake, and my blessing and the forgiveness of Heaven shall rest upon your head."</p>
                  <p>"Were you in your senses, I might listen to you, Zelie," replied the astrologer, "but you are mad. This sudden fancy for the stranger is start insanity. When he is no more, you will look back on this passion as a fevered dream."</p>
                  <p>"Never, father; my mind is unshaken even in the midst of my distress. Spare the life of this young prince!"</p>
                  <p>"My word is pledged to the duke," replied the astrologer, gloomily."</p>
                  <p>"Revoke it."</p>
                  <p>"It cannot be."</p>
                  <p>"Then behold the alternative!" exclaimed Zelie. Springing to the table, where the astrologer had placed it, she seized the phial containing the deadly poison and uncorked it.</p>
                  <p>"Hold, Zelie!" cried the astrologer. "Pause! a single drop of that deadly venom will lay you a quivering corse at my feet."</p>
                  <p>"I know it," said the girl, approaching it to her lips. "I have no wish to live."</p>
                  <p>"Zelie! Zelie!" cried the agonized father, "I will do all you promise. Come ruin, come want—anything, but harm to you. I will break with the duke."</p>
                  <pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC7296-00000017"/>
                  <p>"You swear it?"</p>
                  <p>"I swear it by the prophet of our faith!" said the astrologer, solemnly.</p>
                  <p>"It is well," said the girl, calmly, as she closed the phial.</p>
                  <p>"Give me that fatal draught," said the astrologer.</p>
                  <p>"Nay, father," said the girl; "you have furnished me a weapon that I will never part with. Not against yourself, but in the chances of life, should the storm clouds gather too darkly overhead, should shame and disappointment ever render life a burthen, then this precious draught would give me peace and quiet." As she ended, she hid the phial in her bosom.</p>
                  <p>"You have the soul of the bravest man in the loveliest form of woman," said the astrologer, half-admiring, half-shuddering at her energy. "Now you have my word. But how am I to deal with the duke?"</p>
                  <p>"Listen to me, dear father," said Zelie. "You have often told me that your art enables you to compound a potion the effect of which, seemingly, is to destroy life utterly, but which, in reality, simply suspended animation for many hours, without injuring the patient."</p>
                  <p>"I do indeed possess that secret," replied the astrologer. "It is one of the simplest of my craft. Nay more—I have some of that potion already prepared."</p>
                  <p>"Well then, give it to the duke, instead of the fatal mixture that you promised him. You pledge me your word that it will not injure Giulio."</p>
                  <p>"I should not fear to administer it to your own dear self."</p>
                  <p>"I trust you then. Give this to the duke. Let him administer it to the prisoner, and then we will watch the course of events."</p>
                  <p>"I fear—I fear the issue," said the astrologer, doubtfully.</p>
                  <p>"Fear nothing. You look already brighter—already more like your truer and nobler self, now that your soul is relieved from the weight of guilt you were ready to assume. And O, father, if you value my love, believe me that I love you now more dearly than ever!"</p>
                  <p>"Zelie," said the astrologer, kissing the fair forehead of his daughter, "you can do with me what you like. Your love is the gleam of pure sunshine that traverses my wild and dull existence. So that you are near me and happy, I care not what befalls. These stolen visits give a perception of the bliss of the blessed."</p>
                  <p>"Adieu, father. We shall meet again soon. I must put off these garments, and appear once more in those I hate. It is only in disguise that I can now serve the man I love."</p>
                  <p>With a light step she glided behind the drapery that hung on one side of the apartment, and vanished through some secret egress.</p>
                  <p>"It is destiny that shapes our ends," said the astrologer, as he busied himself with the preparation he was to deliver to the duke, in the place of the deadly composition he had promised. "What is to be will be. It is useless to strive against the decreese of fate. This sudden passion has even mastered the girl. But it may pass like a delusion—a dream. Not even gratitude will induce this prince to marry Zelie, though she be a mate for a monarch. Yet if he prove insensible—if he break her heart, her father will know how to avenge her."</p>
                  <p>In a few moments the duke again sought the presence of the astrologer.</p>
                  <p>"I came," he suddenly said, "to urge your utmost diligence in the matter we agreed upon. I shall have occasion speedily to use the preparation. How soon can you place it in my hands?"</p>
                  <p>"It is ready, my liege," said the astrologer, handing a small phial to his patron.</p>
                  <p>"Thanks, thanks!" cried the duke, joyously.</p>
                  <p>"When murder is to be done, the stroke should be speedy," said the astrologer.</p>
                  <p>"And when work is performed, the recompense should be swift," answered the duke. "Look at these, they are some diamonds I purchased in an extravagant moment of an Eastern merchant. See if they are worth your acceptance;" and he placed a small casket in the hands of the astrologer.</p>
                  <p>The latter was a man accustomed to veil his emotions; yet, when he opened the case and the blaze of the gems shone forth, he could not conceal his satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>"They are magnificent," he said. "It is a gift worthy of a monarch."</p>
                  <p>"If the product of your skill fulfil your promises, the reward shall be doubled," said the duke.</p>
                  <p>The astrologer bowed low, and poured forth his acknowledgements, following the duke to the door, and taking leave of him with the utmost obsequiousness.</p>
                  <p>"Wonderful art!" said the duke, as he regained his cabinet. "A death in every drop of liquid. How much better than the steel and axe!"</p>
                  <p>He concealed the phial, and summoned Montaldo, his equerry.</p>
                  <p>"Ferrado," said he, "the evil days are upon us."</p>
                  <p>"I trust not, my liege."</p>
                  <p>"I will not disguise it. Evils menace the state. Giulio is in my power."</p>
                  <p>"That danger is conjured then."</p>
                  <p>"Not so; he has friends. If the news of his arrest and imprisonment take air, they will be swarming about my ears."</p>
                  <p>"Let them come; we will fight."</p>
                  <p>"Ferrado, I am no longer young," said the duke. "A suit of armor would chafe my limbs. These latter years of luxury have weakened my courage. I must have a strong arm to lean upon."</p>
                  <p>"Your grace knows that my arm and life are at your disposal."</p>
                  <p>"I think so," said the duke. "Ferrado, you must be nearer yet to me. I give you the command of my troops—absolute over them; you will only be subjected to my pleasure."</p>
                  <p>"I accept the post with gratitude," replied Ferrado.</p>
                  <p>"That is not all. I must bind you in yet closer bonds."</p>
                  <p>"The gratitude I owe you is a sufficient pledge of my good conduct," said the equerry.</p>
                  <p>"Nay," said the duke, "hear me out. My daughter, Margarita, is reported lovely."</p>
                  <p>"None lovelier in all Parma."</p>
                  <p>"When she is your bride, Ferrado, you will be as dear to me as herself."</p>
                  <p>"The princess my bride!" exclaimed Ferrado. "Am I dreaming?"</p>
                  <p>"You have my full permission to address her," answered the duke.</p>
                  <p>"My liege, my liege!" cried Ferrado, "you will drive me wild! Never dared I raise my eyes so high as you have bid me look."</p>
                  <p>"Go, good Ferrado," said the duke, pressing his hand, "marshal our men, and see what effective force we can rely on in case the enemy should suddenly assail us."</p>
                  <p>Ferrado, after a warm expression of thanks, retired from the presence of the duke. Had he really forgotten Estella?</p>
                  <p>An usher presented himself, and announced that the vassal of a lady of rank craved an audience with his highness.</p>
                  <p>"Admit him," said the duke.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE MISFORTUNES OF TONIO AND HIS MISTRESS.</head>
                  <p>THE duke's usher, after receiving his orders, withdrew, and immediately afterwards introduced our acquaintance of the villa of Monte Rosa, Tonio the jester. This marvellous individual was attired in a bran new parti-colored suit which he had been reserving for a great occasion. The orange-tawney and scarlet of his garments was absolutely dazzling, in his opinion at least; and he had, moreover, to increase the effect of his presence, bedizened himself with a multitude of ribbons of various lines, which flaunted and fluttered about him as he moved. Such was the extraordinary personage who, not one whit abashed by the rank of the duke, now went through a series of the most grotesque salutations.</p>
                  <p>"Cease those unmeaning gyrations, fellow," said the duke, angrily. "I need not ask what thou art, I perceive thou art a fool."</p>
                  <p>"Any fool can see that with half an eye," replied the jester. "You have hit my calling exactly, most screne and transparent highness. I am witty and wise enough to play the fool; it is my profession. But there are so many amateur fools in the world, they are spoiling the business."</p>
                  <p>"Will you tell me your name" said the duke, impatiently.</p>
                  <p>"That will I incontinently, most high-minded, illustrious, and never-to-be addressed-without-the-utmost-respect potentate."</p>
                  <p>"What is it, then?"</p>
                  <p>"Tonio, for default of a better."</p>
                  <p>"And whose livery do you wear?"</p>
                  <p>"The livery of folly; hence I am everybody's knave, your Screne Transparency. But most particularly and especially am I affected to the service of a very high, very mighty, very noble, worthy, accomplished, beneficent, refined and amiable prince, who dwelleth on the elevated summit of the hill, monticule or mountain, called by the vulgar, Monte Rosa."</p>
                  <p>"Guilio Brigaldi!"</p>
                  <p>"Your immaculate and effulgent excellency has named him."</p>
                  <p>"And what brought you hither?"</p>
                  <p>"Marry, your magnanimous highness, these same well-knit and elegantly modelled legs of mine, after which those of the Apollo would have been moulded had I lived a couple of thousand years ago. Not that I am compelled always to go on foot, tremendous sovereign; for in this world folly rides and wisdom walks. But on this<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC7296-00000018"/> occasion, my mule was affected to the use of a lady—and she was a noble beast; I mean the mule, craving your excellency's pardon."</p>
                  <p>"And pray, sirrah, what is the object of your visit?"</p>
                  <p>"If I were to tell you it was to see the glories of your illustrious court, I should be telling a falsehood, like your courtiers, my luxurious liege, and should deserve a flogging, as they do. We that is the lady and myself, come thither to crave a boon of your high and mighty excellency; a boon that involves the happiness of two worthy friends of mine—the lady I have been speaking of, and her brother, the excellent Signor Guilio."</p>
                  <p>"He is well cared for," said the duke.</p>
                  <p>"Your serene highnesses information is exceedingly acceptable," said the jester.</p>
                  <p>"And you, shall be lodged as he is," said the duke.</p>
                  <p>"Your highness is exceedingly polite," said the jester.</p>
                  <p>"What, he! there! Who waits?" called the duke.</p>
                  <p>The usher who had introduced the jester, entered. The duke whispered a few words in his ear, the man bowed, retired, and presently a tall, stout fellow of sinister aspect entered.</p>
                  <p>"Take this fellow to the place you wet of," said the duke. The man nodded with a grim smile.</p>
                  <p>"This way," said he, laying hold of the jester, and pointing to a door opposite to that by which he had entered.</p>
                  <p>"No, <emph>this</emph> way, my unknown friend," said the jester. "Here's a lady without."</p>
                  <p>"Away with him!" said the duke.</p>
                  <p>"But your highness—" pleaded the jester.</p>
                  <p>"Remove the villain from my sight!" cried the duke, waving his hand.</p>
                  <p>So, in spite of struggles, and of outeries that made the vaulted chamber ring, the unfortunate jester was borne away to durance vile.</p>
                  <p>During the interview between the duke and the jester, Ferrado Montaldo, in retiring from the audience-room, unexpectedly encountered Estella. He could not but feel flattered by the warm glow of pleasure that lighted up her face as she recognized him. She advanced to meet him as if he had been an old friend; for she lacked the experience which would have taught her to suppress her frank emotions.</p>
                  <p>"You here, signor!" she exclaimed. "I am glad to find one face I can recognize among all these stranger countenances."</p>
                  <p>While she was speaking, Ferrado was mentally comparing her attractions with those of the princess, and his heart could not help acknowledging that they far outshone those of the titled lady.</p>
                  <p>"I care not to ask by what chance we have again met, lady," said the equerry. "Whatever it is, it is a blessed one."</p>
                  <p>"My errand is a sad one," said Estella. "I came to seek my brother, hurried away from me, by a troop of the duke's men, in the middle of the night."</p>
                  <p>"I had the pleasure of meeting him here," said the equerry, evasively.</p>
                  <p>"Why was he brought hither, sir? You can tell me all about him—you who belong to the court."</p>
                  <p>"I am Ferrado Montaldo, late master of the horse, now raised to the command of the troops by the generosity of my prince."</p>
                  <p>"Then you are in favor with him, sir," exclaimed Estella. "And you will place his sister in the way to aid him."</p>
                  <p>"I cannot think your brother is in danger signora."</p>
                  <p>"In danger, Signor Montaldo! No! What has he done to endanger him? But he may be deprived of his liberty. Perhaps, however, you can procure me an interview with him."</p>
                  <p>"For that privilege, lady, you must apply to the duke," replied Ferrado.</p>
                  <p>"But you will be my friend—will you not?" asked Estella, persuasively. "You will not desert the cause of two innocent persons, Signor Montaldo."</p>
                  <p>"You may rely upon my services when they can be effectively rendered," said Ferrado. And he meant what he said. The impression the beauty and gentleness of Estella had produced upon him at first sight was deepened by the second interview.</p>
                  <p>"Will you not go before the duke with me now?"</p>
                  <p>"I regret to say that I cannot. He has just assigned me a duty to perform. As soon as that task is despatched, I will hasten back to the palace to receive your commands. But you need no friend with the duke. Your own beauty and eloquence will be the best advocates of your cause. Adieu, lady—you can rely upon my sympathy and aid."</p>
                  <p>Estella felt animated and encouraged by this brief interview. She had secured one friend—and a powerful one—at the court of Parma. While she awaited with some anxiety a summons to the presence of the duke, she was startled by the shouts and outcries of Tonio, as he was borne away. Alarmed beyond expression at this occurrence, and unwilling to desert her servant in his hour of need, she suddenly made her way into the presence of the duke, and to her astonishment, found him alone. The drapery which masked the door by which the jester had been carried away had dropped and hung as motionless as if it had never been disturbed.</p>
                  <p>The duke rose and saluted his visitor.</p>
                  <p>"If I mistake not," said he, "you are one so near to me in blood, that I should recognize you at the first glance, as my brother's child."</p>
                  <p>"You see before you, my lord," said the maiden, simply, "Estella—Giulio's sister."</p>
                  <p>"And is it to see Giulio or myself that you have visited Parma?" asked the duke, with a bland smile.</p>
                  <p>"Both, your grace," replied Estella, falteringly. "I am aware that it is only through you that I can see my brother."</p>
                  <p>"Why this anxiety about your brother, maiden? I had an urgent desire to see him—I sent an escort for him, and he is here."</p>
                  <p>"Where, my lord?" inquired Estella, fixing her bright eyes on the sovereign.</p>
                  <p>"Where he has no longer the power to harm me," replied the duke, sternly.</p>
                  <p>"Duke of Parma!" said Estella, shaking off her embarrassment at once, and assuming a tone of command, "I demand an explicit answer to my question. What have you done with my brother?"</p>
                  <p>"He is within a dungeon," said the duke.</p>
                  <p>"Ah! You have not dared to do it!" cried Estella.</p>
                  <p>"Dared!" retorted the duke. "You forget, girl, whom you are addressing. Am I not Duke of Parma?"</p>
                  <p>"By what title?"</p>
                  <p>"By the title of my iron will—a will that has hitherto broken every obstacle that crossed its path."</p>
                  <p>"What has my brother done," exclaimed Estella, "that you should treat him in this manner—so unnaturally? He lived quietly at Monte Rosa."</p>
                  <p>"Ay—but he lived!" retorted the duke.</p>
                  <p>"I understand you," said Estella: and though the blood curdled at her heart, she maintained a bold front, and continued to speak with an unfaltering voice. "So long as Giulio was at liberty, your throne seemed insecure. I know but little, it is true, of public affairs, but yet my common sense tells me you have made a mistake. Giulio at liberty is less dangerous than Giulio in prison."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed!" said the duke, sarcastically, raising his eyebrows as he emphasized the exclamation.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, my lord, a great mistake," continued Estella. "We have friends, my lord, humble as we seem. So long as Giulio was permitted to remain on his estate undisturbed—and I did my best to make him love retirement—those friends remained quiescent. You have deprived him of the dearest blessing of life—liberty, and have thus absolved them from the implied obligation to keep the peace."</p>
                  <p>"You talk like a politician," said the duke. "These ideas cannot have come to you intuitively. No, no, I see it all. Your brother has canvassed with you all the chances of success—estimated his strength, and prepared for rebellion."</p>
                  <p>"You wrong him—foully wrong him," cried Estella, warmly. "I have often heard him deny the right of an individual to risk the misery of a people in the convulsion of a civil war, even to regain a throne of which he was wrongfully dispossessed. The peace of Parma was dearer to Giulio than his personal aggrandizement."</p>
                  <p>"I believe it not," said the duke. "I believe he was secretly concluding measures with the Duke of Milan to strike for the dueal coronet of Parma."</p>
                  <p>"You have been grossly deceived—or your fears have deceived you," said Estelln. "No such thought ever entered Giulio's soul."</p>
                  <p>"He never allowed you to fathom its dark depths, then," replied the duke. "I am convinced that he was in league with the Duke of Milan."</p>
                  <p>"O, beware of Milan, my lord!" said Estella. "Her duke is the soul of chivalry—his lances are the best in Haly. When he marches against Parma, the knell of your power is tolled."</p>
                  <p>"I laugh to scorn the prophecy, girl," was the duke's reply. "I feared but one man—and that man is in my power."</p>
                  <p>"Set him free, and you are safe," said Estella.</p>
                  <p>"I accept no counsel from your lips," said the duke.</p>
                  <p>"Duke of Parma!" cried the maiden, "I came hither to implore my brother's liberation.<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC7296-00000019"/> I now no longer ask it for my sake—I warn you to set him free for yours."</p>
                  <p>"Were an angel to plead for him, I would spurn the suppliant."</p>
                  <p>"Then hear me!" said Estella "Christendom shall know from these lips that you are a false and traitorous sovereign. I will go from court to court and proclaim that Francisce of Parma is a false knight—unworthy of the spurs he wears. I will set up my banner, and summon all true knights to rally round it. These towers may be stormed, for mighty as they seem, while there is justice in Heaven and valor on earth, there is hope for us. My tongue shall become a trumpet to proclaim thy shame and my brother's wrongs."</p>
                  <p>"Verily you are transformed, maiden!" cried the duke, in a tone of affected admiration. "Minerva—Bellona—what shall I call you?"</p>
                  <p>"You know not, proud duke, what a woman—a young maiden—may achieve, when stung by a sense of intolerable injury."</p>
                  <p>"Nay, fair one, I know full well the power of a woman's pleading. I grant that your enmity would prove most formidable. I frankly confess that you might, in a few days, by the influence of your beauty and your admirable eloquence, arouse a mighty host against me. But there is one condition to your success that you have doubtless overlooked."</p>
                  <p>"Name it!"</p>
                  <p>"Your liberty."</p>
                  <p>"I do not understand you."</p>
                  <p>"When an individual becomes dangerous to the state," pursued the duke, "sex is no longer regarded. Though we may deem the limbs of a woman too delicate to wear chains, yet we may restrain her fury within solid walls."</p>
                  <p>"You cannot mean—"</p>
                  <p>"I mean simply—that as your relative, and, consequently, your natural guardian, in the incompetency of your brother—to hold you a prisoner."</p>
                  <p>"Ah!" cried Estella, perceiving at a glance the position in which she was placed. "Why did I come hither unarmed!"</p>
                  <p>The duke clapped his hands thrice. Three or four attendants answered the summons.</p>
                  <p>"Convey this lady to my daughter's apartments," said he. "Place a guard without, and see that she leaves them not, on peril of your lives. Now, maiden," he added, "I think your eloquence will do me little harm."</p>
                  <p>"False duke!" retorted Estella, "we shall yet be avenged."</p>
                  <p>With these words on her lips, she was hurried away.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">SUNSHINE IN THE PRISON.</head>
                  <p>GIULIO, sitting in his lonely cell, a prey to those anxieties and irritations which beset the bravest hearts in their hours of imprisonment, was roused from his unpleasant reveries, as the shades of evening began to darken, by the heavy footstep of the jailer, which he had already learned to distinguish from that of his fellows. But he could not hear, for it was light as a snowflake, the footstep of a companion. The heavy iron door was cautiously swung back, the burly figure of the jailer darkened the threshold as it passed it, and the sudden radiance from the lamp he carried in his hand, at first prevented the prisoner from seeing that the man was not alone. As his custodian withdrew, after placing the lamp in a socket attached to one of the stone pillars, Giulio became aware of a tall and slender figure shrouded in a mantle that remained behind. Deeming this personage a companion in misfortune, he advanced and said:</p>
                  <p>"Stranger, I know not your name, but I welcome you to a gloomy lot."</p>
                  <p>"I am no stranger," said a silvery voice, in reply, and as the veil parted and the mantle fell, Giulio recognized the Princess Margarita.</p>
                  <p>He bowed coldly.</p>
                  <p>"Signora," said he, "methinks you might have spared yourself the trouble of coming to witness the triumph of your father's tyranny and of your contrivance."</p>
                  <p>"My contrivance! Giulio—prince!" cried the duke's daughter, tears succeeding to the passing glow of indignation which had at first tinged her cheeks.</p>
                  <p>"Are you not my enemy?" asked Giulio, sternly.</p>
                  <p>"Your enemy?" She could say no more—her heart was too full.</p>
                  <p>"Was I not arrested in your own apartment, whither you had invited me?"</p>
                  <p>"True—but I knew not my father's intentions toward you. I was thunderstruck when you were seized—the atrocity of the act paralyzed my powers, and believe me, I experienced the deepest shame, the greatest distress, at this violation of the rites of hospitality and the claims of blood. Were not such my feelings, believe me, prince, I should not be here alone, at this hour. What—who could have induced you to form so unfavorable an opinion of me—to think me so mean, so guilty a wretch?"</p>
                  <p>Giulio was on the point of replying, "your own page," but he closed his lips ere the words found utterance. Though thoroughly convinced by the manner no less than by the words of the princess, that she had been grossly slandered, he could not in honor surrender the page—guilty of libel though he were—to her legitimate indignation. The boy had undertaken to perform a dangerous and fatiguing service, and that obligation should cancel his other fault, however great.</p>
                  <p>"Lady," said the prisoner, "I have sinned against you in my thoughts, prompted by appearances which, to the excited mind of a man in my situation, seemed convincing proof. But I blush to have entertained them, even for a moment—to have thought you for a moment other than the angel you are."</p>
                  <p>"I have ventured hither," said the princess, in a low tone, "using the authority my rank gives me, and abusing the confidence my father reposes in me, in obedience to an uncontrollable impulse, which bade me see you—beg you be of good cheer, and tell you that in the very heart of your enemy's stronghold, you had one powerful friend, devoted to your cause."</p>
                  <p>"Then I have friends within and without the garrison!" cried Giulio.</p>
                  <p>"I have other news for you," said the princess. "Your sister is at Parma."</p>
                  <p>"My sister here!"</p>
                  <p>"She came hither to seek you, and demand your liberation of the duke."</p>
                  <p>"Alas! why did she place herself in his power? Why did she not remain at Monte Rosa?"</p>
                  <p>"She is imprisoned here."</p>
                  <p>"Estella imprisoned! Her delicate form stretched on the cold floor of a cell!"</p>
                  <p>"Nay—hear me!" said the princess, with a smile. "The duke is not so hard-hearted as to treat a woman with that severity. She has a gentler jailer than yourself. She is entrusted to my charge and secluded within my apartments."</p>
                  <p>"I have nothing to fear, then, so long as she is with you. But tell me, signora—my sister came not to Parma alone?"</p>
                  <p>"No; your faithful servant, the jester, came with her."</p>
                  <p>"Faithful fellow! We are all then in the power of our enemy."</p>
                  <p>"I am sorry to tell you that the jester to imprisoned. I could not procure his immediate liberation. But I have ordered Matteo to place him in your cell."</p>
                  <p>"Thanks—thanks—you are indeed an angel of mercy, and your presence to-night is like a gleam of sunshine in the dark chambers of my heart. Beautiful princess, it was a providence by which we met; you are now my Providence, as you come on your errand of mercy. I lift my eyes to you as a superior being; and yet, in spite of your dazzling attributes, I dare to love you, and confess it."</p>
                  <p>The princess trembled with emotion. Giulio took her hand and kneeled at her feet.</p>
                  <p>"O, say not that you deside my suit and are offended at my daring. I cannot control my emotions, I cannot conceal my wishes. There is a wide, wide gulf between yourself and me; but it may be overleaped. Fortune may smile upon me."</p>
                  <p>"Your fortune would be my father's rain," said the princess.</p>
                  <p>"For your dear sake, I would not harm a hair of his head. In any event his life shall be sacred. But you turn away—you are offended."</p>
                  <p>The princess had concealed her face, but her tears fell upon the hand that grasped hers. Those tears were a revelation.</p>
                  <p>"Dearest Margarita, you do not hate me: those are not tears of grief and angel."</p>
                  <p>A gentle pressure of the hand was the reply.</p>
                  <p>"It is not walls of stone that make a prison!" cried Giulio, joyously, as he clasped the princess in his arms, and dared to imprint a first kiss on her lips. "You have made this cell an Eden; you have given me more than life—you have given me a motive for living."</p>
                  <p>The princess gently extricated herself from his embrace.</p>
                  <p>"Giulio," she said, "I have remained here too long. My place is elsewhere. I must be active in your behalf."</p>
                  <p>"Go then, dearest, since it must be so," said Giulio, "and tell my sister that I am happy. Tell her all; tell her that we love each other. And for my part, whatever may be my fate, this moment of bliss will atone for every pang that tyranny can inflict on me. Good night, sweets, I must not detain you, though every moment of your presence is a priceless joy."</p>
                  <p>And so, with one more embrace, the lovers<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7296-00000020"/> parted. Giulio paced his narrow cell with as light a step as if he were in the enjoyment of full liberty. He forgot the scene. The prison walls crumbled away. The blue sky of Italy was overhead, flowers springing up at his feet, the melody of birds and falling waters in his ears, and she beside him, the charm and joy of his existence. From this paradisiacal dream he was recalled to earth by the grating of his door upon its hinges. A light figure stole to his side. It was the page.</p>
                  <p>"So soon returned, my Mercury?" said Giulio.</p>
                  <p>"I returned long ago," said the page, "but I could not come hither before. Indeed, I had not many leagues to ride, for I met the Duke of Milan in arms, and on the march."</p>
                  <p>"Hither?"</p>
                  <p>"Ay, my lord."</p>
                  <p>"Then Heaven be praised. Liberty is not far distant."</p>
                  <p>"Ere to-morrow's dawn you will hear the trumpets of Milan at the gates."</p>
                  <p>"Gallant kinsman!" cried Giulio. "Would I were free to share your danger and mount with you to the assault. Boy, you have done me a priceless service; if fortune smile, I will require you loyally."</p>
                  <p>"Your words are an ample compensation," said the page. "But if I might crave a boon, I would pray you to bestow on me that little ring I see on your left hand."</p>
                  <p>"It has no value, it is a simple circlet of gold," said the prince, drawing off the ring.</p>
                  <p>"Have you not worn it?" asked the page, reproachfully.</p>
                  <p>"You are sentimental," said the prince, smiling; "but take it, and let it be a token of friendship. And if, intoxicated by freedom and success, Giulio Veroni forget his obligation to you, the sight of that ring will recall it to his mind. But fear not, boy—I shall never forget. I shall not, I think, exhibit the infirmity of princes—ingratitude. And now, good night."</p>
                  <p>The page kneeled and kissed the prince's hand. His lips were warm and soft, and he shed tears as he performed this act of homage. Giulio smiled, though he was touched at this boyish enthusiasm.</p>
                  <p>"I have certainly the faculty of making friends," he thought, as the door closed on his retiring visitor.</p>
                  <p>Some time after this, he was making preparations to retire for the night, when the door again swung open to admit another prisoner, and was then again locked. The new comer rushed forward and threw himself at the prince's feet. It was Tonio, the jester.</p>
                  <p>"Master! master!" said the faithful fellow, "we have fallen on evil days. Don't blame me. I would have prevented the scoundrels from getting at you in the villa, but they surprised me. I was helpless."</p>
                  <p>"I do not blame you. I never doubted your fidelity," said the prince, raising him.</p>
                  <p>"We are all in the power of the tyrant," said the jester, dismally. "Yourself, the signorina and the poor fool. What will become of us? Marry, I fear that they will send the signorina to a convent for life—you will be beheaded, and as for me, they'll make minced meat of me with their chopping knives and toss me to the dogs."</p>
                  <p>"You talk like a fool," said the prince.</p>
                  <p>"Then I speak in character," moaned the jester, "and that's a great consolation. It doesn't much matter about me. For I've lived like a fool, and it's a sort of promotion to die like a martyr. But you, my noble young master, the flower of Italy, to be cut off in the prime of life, by the ferocity of an avuncular relative. O, why were uncles ever invented? I am glad I was a foundling, and never troubled with relations. Once I had great expectations—cultivated a red mark on my left shoulder and expected to prove the heir to a title and a principality. But I don't want my relatives to come forward now. I'm afraid of 'em."</p>
                  <p>"I didn't expect you to be downcast."</p>
                  <p>"O, of course not! It's my duty to be funny under every circumstance. But let me tell you, master of mine, that professional gayety is the least reliable of all resources, and if they were to hang me to-morrow morning, I don't think I should have the least bit of a joke with Jack Ketch. It's your sad dogs that are merry ones in the last of the drama."</p>
                  <p>"But we haven't got to the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">exeunt omnes</foreign> yet, my friend," said the prince, smiling. "I have good news for you."</p>
                  <p>"Not before they're wanted."</p>
                  <p>"Hear me—if you can be rational one moment."</p>
                  <p>"I'm all ears, like a donkey," said the jester.</p>
                  <p>"The Duke of Milan is marching on Parma."</p>
                  <p>"Good!" cried the jester.</p>
                  <p>"He will be here to-morrow morning, at the furthest."</p>
                  <p>"Better!" exclaimed Tonio. "Go on, my lord, this is fine."</p>
                  <p>"You can conjecture what will happen next."</p>
                  <p>"Or I were no conjuror," replied the jester. "A demand for the unconditional surrender of the prisoners. Refusal. Slam hang! cut and slash, kick and hack, gunpowder and steel, broken heads, battering rams, lots of smoke—glory and victory. We are free—the usurper falls into our hands. We torture him a little, just by way of pastime, then chop off his head and set it on the city gates as a warning to all such carrion scoundrels."</p>
                  <p>"No, Tonio, banishment is the heaviest penalty I could find it in my heart to inflict on my worst enemy."</p>
                  <p>"You are too merciful by half. But are you sure of your intelligence, my lord?"</p>
                  <p>"As of my life."</p>
                  <p>"Who informed you?"</p>
                  <p>"An angel."</p>
                  <p>"Enough. I doubt no longer. And now, master—let us go to sleep and dream of a glorious awakening on the morrow."</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR.</head>
                  <p>THE Lady Estella sat alone in the private apartment of the princess, in which the lamps had not been lighted. The soft starlight, however, and the beams of a young moon detached her light and graceful figure, as she leaned upon the marble window seat, from the shadowy background of the apartment. Sad enough she was at heart, but she exhibited no external trace of emotion. She had passed through the phases of indignation and passionate grief; words of defiance were hushed, tears of passionate sorrow dried. Reverently, prayerfully had she bowed her spirit, and from her commune with the sole Power that could aid her in her distress, she had risen in a better frame, though still despondent. From her stirless position she was aroused by a bustle in the ante-room, and presently, the door opening, a female figure entered and moved towards her.</p>
                  <p>"Estella?" said a gentle voice.</p>
                  <p>"I recognize you by the tone, lady," said Estella, "for I cannot distinguish your features. None but the Princess Margarita could speak so gently to a lonely prisoner."</p>
                  <p>"Call me sister," said the princess, in the same sweet voice.</p>
                  <p>"Nay, lady," replied Estella, "I cannot—must not—forget the distance which separates you, the titled lady, from me, the humble maiden."</p>
                  <p>"Speak not of my rank," said the princess, sadly. "It reminds me of our shame. Alas! I am no longer ignorant that my father and myself are decked in borrowed plumes—that the splendor that surrounds us is not ours of right—and that one wave of the stern hand of justice may dissolve this stately pageant that environs me."</p>
                  <p>"No blame attaches to yourself, lady, in the course of events that placed your father on the throne."</p>
                  <p>"Whatever tarnishes his name is a brand upon my brow," replied the princess. "But let me do my part in mitigating the severity of his decrees at least. You are given to my charge—but your prison house shall be my arms. Believe me, I shall not be a cruel jailer. If you will await me here one moment, I will summon the attendants with lights."</p>
                  <p>"Do you not prefer the twilight glimmer of the moon and stars?" asked Estella.</p>
                  <p>"If you prefer them—certainly," replied the princess.</p>
                  <p>She came and sat down beside Estella, and took her hand.</p>
                  <p>"You declined just now to call me sister—you would not hesitate if you knew what had recently occurred."</p>
                  <p>"Indeed, lady!"</p>
                  <p>"Yes—something to draw us near to each other, Estella. I have lately seen your brother."</p>
                  <p>"Giulio? In his prison?"</p>
                  <p>"He is in confinement, but he is not treated with unusual severity. His limbs are free—my father has not dared to add chains to imprisonment."</p>
                  <p>"Thank Heaven for that."</p>
                  <p>"He learned from me that you were here."</p>
                  <p>"Thanks—thanks!"</p>
                  <p>"And that you were given to my charge; and he bade me he the messenger of his love to you."</p>
                  <p>"Was it with that you left him?"</p>
                  <p>"Nay—sister—" faltered the princess. "He told me that he loved me—and I—"</p>
                  <p>"You checked his aspirations?"</p>
                  <p>"I confessed my love for him."</p>
                  <p>"Ah! we are sisters then in heart!" cried the young girl, throwing herself into the arms of the princess, and weeping for joy.</p>
                  <p>"But why am I thus elated?" exclaimed Estella, suddenly checking her expressions of delight. "I forget the actual circumstances in which we are placed—Giulio regarded as an enemy<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7296-00000021"/> my by your father, and in prison. There is an insurmountable barrier between him and yourself."</p>
                  <p>"His life is safe," cried the princess, "while my life is spared. My father loves me tenderly. With all his faults there is that brilliant ray of sunshine in the darkness of his nature. Much may be hoped from that."</p>
                  <p>Estella shook her head.</p>
                  <p>"Love of power, fear of a rival," she said, "are motives strong enough to stifle even his love for you. Were that our sole reliance, Giulio might linger his life out in a dungeon, or perish there by the hand of violence."</p>
                  <p>"You appal me!" said the princess.</p>
                  <p>"Let me be a comforter in turn," said Estella. "Giulio has powerful friends without, who may demand his liberation in a manner not to be refused."</p>
                  <p>"But how will they learn his position?"</p>
                  <p>"They cannot long remain in ignorance. The deserted villa—the abduction of Giulio known to the peasantry will soon tell the tale. If Giulio is saved from immediate violence, something may be hoped."</p>
                  <p>"Then we will be of good cheer," replied the princess. "For my life shall be the guaranty of Giulio's safety. But the night is wearing on, dearest—both of us, shaken by emotion, have need of repose. I presume," she added, smiling, "my duty to my father requires that my charge shall not go out of my sight. You will, therefore, share my couch to-night. Shall I summon my attendants to disrobe you?"</p>
                  <p>"I am used to perform that service for myself," replied Estella. "And if you will permit me to be your handmaiden, I think you will not regret the absence of hirelings."</p>
                  <p>"Willingly, dearest," replied the princess. "I am weary of the forms of state. The attendants of the great are spies—their attachment only mercenary. Come, then, to my chamber."</p>
                  <p>The princess and her guest passed then to an inner apartment. Long after they had retired, they talked of their innocent hopes and wishes, until, wearied out at last, they breathed their holy prayers to Heaven, and sunk to repose in a sisterly embrace. So sound was their first sleep that neither of them was awakened by the shrill blast of a trumpet piercing the ear of night, and borne on the breeze through the open windows of the palace. Whatever this sound portended, it soon subsided. But the slumbers of Margarita were broken by a different cause. An ice-cold hand laid upon her warm check awoke her instantly.</p>
                  <p>"Hush! no noise!" said a voice, "or you will rouse your companion."</p>
                  <p>The princess, much perturbed, passed her hand over her brow in the effort to collect her scattered senses, and gently disengaged herself from the arms of Estella. By her bedside stood, dimly illuminated by the moonlight, a graceful female figure, clad in Persian or Turkish costume. From the dim countenance eyes of fiery lustre shone forth like stars in the night, and seemed to gaze into the very soul of the princess.</p>
                  <p>"Who are you? whence come you?" asked Margarita.</p>
                  <p>"No matter who I am, or whence I come. My purpose is sufficient. Arise and follow me to the next room, or you will awake you sleeper. There is no time to be lost. Deny me, and you will ever regret it."</p>
                  <p>"But how did you obtain admission into my private apartment?"</p>
                  <p>"No place is sacred to my footsteps when I will," replied the stranger. "But arise quickly—I command you."</p>
                  <p>Margarita was not exempt from the superstitions of the age. She scarcely doubted that the being before her belonged to the world of spirits, and obeying a will stronger than her own, she rose from her couch, and followed the visitor into the next room, where she sank upon a seat and breathlessly awaited the promised communication.</p>
                  <p>"I disturbed a dream of fantastic bliss," said the stranger. "Start not—I can read your very soul. You were dreaming of Giulio Brigaldi."</p>
                  <p>"Alas! what unhallowed power do you possess?" cried the princess.</p>
                  <p>"There are no secrets from me," replied the mysterious visitor. "This night you saw him in his dungeon."</p>
                  <p>"It is useless to deny it."</p>
                  <p>"He told you that he loved you, and you confessed your love to him."</p>
                  <p>The princess suffered her head to sink upon her breast. She was appalled and abashed.</p>
                  <p>"The sooner," pursued the visitor, "that you dismiss this fantastic dream from your mind, the better for your repose. Giulio loves another."</p>
                  <p>"It is false!" said the princess, shaking off the fear which had enthralled her. "Whoever you are, mortal or spirit—woman or fiend—I spurn the false assertion."</p>
                  <p>The strange lady smiled, and extended her left hand.</p>
                  <p>"Do you recognize this ring?" she asked, triumphantly.</p>
                  <p>The moonbeam fell upon the fair hand of the mysterious visitant, and illumined the little circlet of gold to which the princess's attention was directed, and which was of a peculiar construction. She was confounded as she recognized it.</p>
                  <p>"I saw it," she faltered, "this evening on Giulio's hand; how came you in possession of it?"</p>
                  <p>"It is a precious family heir-loom," replied the stranger. "Dying, Giulio's mother bestowed it on him, with the injunction to wear it until he plighted his love, and then to bestow it on the object of his affections. To you, he gave no pledge—to me, his mother's gift. You are warned. Profit by the warning."</p>
                  <p>"But this is dreadful!' said the princess, wringing her hands. "But come what may," she added, starting up, "you shall not leave this apartment till I know who you are. I will summon my attendants."</p>
                  <p>"Silence!" said the stranger. "You are completely in my power. Your attendants, drugged with medicated wine, sleep a leaden sleep most like to death. You are helpless, while I am armed. Advance one step toward me—utter a word above your breath, and your doom is sealed!"</p>
                  <p>As these words were uttered in a tone of determination, an unsheathed poignard suddenly gleamed in the woman's right hand. The princess was powerless as a child.</p>
                  <p>"Back to your chamber!" said the stranger, in a commanding tone. "Know that there are those who laugh to scorn the power of duke and princess here in Parma. Back to your couch and ponder on my warning. It was for your peace I came to you to-night. Do not make me repent my condescension."</p>
                  <p>Disheartened, distressed, appalled, the princess obeyed without a murmur, and retired, closing the door behind her.</p>
                  <p>"May this stratagem rid me of a rival, and turn her love to hate!" said Zelie, the astrologer's daughter, when she was left alone. "Next—to poison <emph>his</emph> mind—and then to win him by those arts that I am mistress of, when his liberty is secured. He shall love me, or he shall die by steel or poison. But I—" she murmured, shuddering at the images her imagination conjured up, "I shall not survive him."</p>
                  <p>Lifting the velvet hanging, and pressing the spring of a secret panel, she glided away like a spectre, and was soon in the suite of apartments occupied by her father.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE SUMMONS AND THE ANSWER.</head>
                  <p>THE sound of the trumpet, which failed to awaken the sleeping princess and her companion, roused the troops that manned the walls, as it broke on the silence of the night. A subaltern officer who held command at one of the gates, on looking, beheld a horseman in armor, bearing a flag of truce depending from his lance, and accompanying a mounted herald who had blown the shrill summons to the garrison.</p>
                  <p>As the herald refused to communicate his business to an inferior officer, Ferrado was sent for, and speedily made his appearance on the summit of a bastion, clad from head to heel in plate armor, beautifully inlaid with gold, while a towering plume of snow-white feathers tossed upon his crest, and the spurs of knighthood glittered on his heels.</p>
                  <p>"Behold," said he, "Ferrado Montaldo, commandant of the garrison of Parma, by the grace of his kinsman, the duke. And now, who are ye, who thus come in the dead of night, to break the slumbers of a peaceful city?"</p>
                  <p>The herald raised his visor, while the man-at-arms beside him lifted a torch he bore in his left hand, so as to throw its full ruddy light on the face of his companion.</p>
                  <p>"Sir commandant," said the herald, "in me you behold the herald king-at-arms to his grace, the Duke of Milan, who is close at hand. My noble master has learned that his grace of Parma hath caused to be seized, in the dead of night, in his peaceful residence at Monte Rosa, the person of Giulio, son to the late Duke of Parma, and kin to his grace of Milan; that he brought him into his city like a criminal, and that he has, without a shadow of cause, without trial, without hearing, deprived him of his liberty and shut him up, like a felon, in a dungeon."</p>
                  <p>"And if this were true," replied Ferrado, haughtily, "is not his grace of Parma as sovereign within his own state, as your master in Milan? Giulio was his vassal, over whom he has power of life and limb."</p>
                  <p>"It is true, then, that he is a prisoner?"</p>
                  <p>"I do not seek to deny it," answered Ferrado.</p>
                  <p>"Then listen to the remainder of my message, sir knight. His grace of Milan saith as follows.<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7296-00000022"/> He is here present with a powerful army, outnumbering, ten to one, that of Parma, whose weak walls can ill support an onset. If, saith my master, by sunrise to-morrow, the Prince, Giulio be set free and delivered to his hand, all is well; my master will depart in peace, and the friendly relations of Milan and Parma will not be disturbed; but if, blind to his own interests and a sense of honor, the Duke of Parma neglects to comply with this just demand, that his grace of Milan will proceed against him as against a foul traitor, a dishonored knight and a deadly enemy. He will advance to the assault of these walls, and in two hours will be master of Parma."</p>
                  <p>"These are boastful words," replied Montaldo, "and ere I report them to my master, I must be satisfied that Milan has power to make them good. I doubt the force he brings against us."</p>
                  <p>"You shall be satisfied of that, sir knight," replied the herald.</p>
                  <p>Wheeling his horse about he took the torch from his attendant, and waving it three times over his head, threw it high into the air. It was instantly answered by the sudden blaze of a beacon fire in the midst of the dusky plain that stretched away before the walls, and then, as if by magic, thousands of torches were instantly kindled, and the whole country was a blaze. It appeared to the astonished eyes of Montaldo, as if daylight had suddenly dawned; but what was his surprise when he saw that each torch was held by a man-at-arms, perfectly equipped in steel. There were clouds of archers with longbows and cross-bows—there were masses of splendidly mounted cavalry, and dense columns of infantry, their armor shining like black water in the torchilight, while the fierce blaze was reflected by the polished tubes of an immense park of artillery. Suddenly every torch was extinguished and the splendidly appointed and formidable host was swallowed up in a darkness that seemed Cimmerian, from its contrast with the recent effulgence, though the night was by no means dark, and after a while, Montaldo, now that he knew their position, could still descry the frowning masses of the enemy.</p>
                  <p>"I will repeat your message to his grace," he said calmly, "if you will await my return."</p>
                  <p>Descending from the walls, he mounted his horse and rode in hot haste to the palace, where he was instantly admitted to the presence of the duke, whom he found pacing his apartment with feverish impatience.</p>
                  <p>"Well, Montaldo, what is it—this summons?"</p>
                  <p>"Milan is at the gates."</p>
                  <p>"As I surmised and feared."</p>
                  <p>"He has sent a herald to say that the Duke of Milan has word of the imprisonment of Giulio."</p>
                  <p>"You denied the fact," said the duke.</p>
                  <p>"I could not deny it."</p>
                  <p>"It matters not—what next?"</p>
                  <p>"The Duke of Milan demands that Giulio be given up to him to-morrow morning at sunrise."</p>
                  <p>"What if I decline compliance with this arrogant demand?"</p>
                  <p>"He threatens to storm the city."</p>
                  <p>"Does he come in force?"</p>
                  <p>"He has force enough, my lord, to carry the city by assault."</p>
                  <p>"How know you that?" asked the duke.</p>
                  <p>"At a signal from the herald, the camp was suddenly lighted up by thousands of torches, and I beheld with my own eyes the entire strength of the enemy. On the word of a soldier, my liege, a better appointed army never took the field."</p>
                  <p>"The sight has terrified you, Ferrado," said the duke, though his own cheek was blanched with dismay, and his lip quivered even as he taunted his officer.</p>
                  <p>"Not so, my liege. I am ready to defend the city to the last gasp."</p>
                  <p>The duke remained for a few moments silent, and plunged in deep and painful thought. At last he raised his head, and said:</p>
                  <p>"Ferrado, I will accede to the demand."</p>
                  <p>"Shall I so notify the herald?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes—tell him that by sunrise to-morrow morning, the Prince Giulio shall be escorted to the camp of Milan with a guard of honor befitting his birth."</p>
                  <p>A gleam of satisfaction lighted up the face of the commander, as this decision was communicated to him.</p>
                  <p>"I am glad of this, my liege," he said, heartily. "You have not only saved your city, but your honor. Open to Prince Giulio an honorable career elsewhere, and he will never disturb your peace."</p>
                  <p>"You are a profound politician, my Ferrado," said the duke, with a crafty smile. "You must lay aside your plume and armor, and be my minister of state."</p>
                  <p>"I had rather deal hard blows than pore over parchments," replied Ferrado.</p>
                  <p>"There are no more hard blows to deal henceforth, my fair kinsman," said the duke. "We have arranged all that. Milan will be a faster ally than before, and if a hand be raised against us, Giulio, grateful for his liberty, will strike it down. Do you not think so?"</p>
                  <p>"I do sincerely, my lord," replied Ferrado, frankly.</p>
                  <p>"Then go to the wall with your message, and send back you herald to his master. He must be tired by this time of a chill seat in the saddle."</p>
                  <p>Ferrado made his obesance and hastened to perform his errand.</p>
                  <p>"Fool! idiot!" muttered the duke. "A boy could hoodwink him. But they shall have Giulio, and I wish them joy of their acquisition."</p>
                  <p>Leaving the duke, let us return to the chamber of the Princess Margarita. After her interview with her mysterious visitant, she found it impossible to sleep. An irresistible desire to communicate with Giulio took possession of her. She could not credit the tale of his duplicity. Her generous nature told her that it was impossible that he could be guilty of deception, and the idea of some dark plot against his happiness as well as hers, took possession of her mind. She resolved, therefore, to see him at all hazards.</p>
                  <p>Hastily dressing herself, she left her suite of apartments with a noiseless step, and tiaversing the passages that communicated with the prison, every door of which was open to her at all hours, for her father had commanded all his vassals to pay her the same obedience as to himself, she found and roused up the jailer from his sleep on abench. Mattco rubbed his eyes and gazed with astonishment upon her.</p>
                  <p>"Has morning broke so soon?" he asked, growlingly.</p>
                  <p>"No," replied the princess. "I have disturbed your slumbers, but you can resume them when you have accomplished my will."</p>
                  <p>"And what is it, lady?"</p>
                  <p>"I command you to bring hither the prisoner, Prince Giulio, committed to your charge yesterday."</p>
                  <p>The jailer hesitated.</p>
                  <p>"Did his grace, the duke, command it?" he asked.</p>
                  <p>"Vassal I your duty is obedience," said the princess, haughtily. "Know you this signet ring with the ducal coronet?"</p>
                  <p>She extended her hand as she spoke, and the man, after gazing on the token, hesitated no longer. Clashing his bunch of heavy keys, he shuffled away down the long, dark corridor, and in a few moments returned with Prince Giulio.</p>
                  <p>"Now leave us," said the princess, "and return hither in ten minutes."</p>
                  <p>The jailer bowed and retired.</p>
                  <p>"Giulio," said the princess, taking his hand, "answer me one question. When is the ring you wore upon this finger when we parted today?"</p>
                  <p>"I have bestowed it as a gift," replied the prince, no less astonished at the question than at her appearance in the prison at the dead of the night.</p>
                  <p>"A gift!" said the princess, falteringly, "to whom?"</p>
                  <p>"To your page—Selim—as a token that I would not be unmindful of the service he had rendered me."</p>
                  <p>"What service?"</p>
                  <p>"Know you not? But I forgot; you cannot know anything about it. For my sake, braving every peril, he rode forth to-day and communicated my situation to my kinsman of Milan."</p>
                  <p>"He breathed not a word to me about this errand."</p>
                  <p>"Doubtless he questioned your interest in my fate. In fact, he suspects you of being my enemy."</p>
                  <p>"I! <emph>your</emph> enemy, Giulio!"</p>
                  <p>"Do not blame him. He naturally thought that you would take your father's side."</p>
                  <p>"He knew me better. O, Giulio, I fear that boy is an enemy of both. I fear, I know not what—that some dark intrigue is weaving round—that your life is in peril. Prompt action alone can save you. You must fly."</p>
                  <p>"Fly? You mock my situation, dearest—a prisoner."</p>
                  <p>"But I posses power equal to my father, at least for a while. In a few hours my privileges may—nay, doubtless will be withdrawn. But I to-night possess my father's signet ring. It will give you liberty."</p>
                  <p>"But you will share my flight?"</p>
                  <p>"Nay; I cannot leave my father, guilty though he is. And I must remain to cover your retreat, and to protect your sister."</p>
                  <p>"But must I leave my poor, faithful Tonio?"</p>
                  <p>"No harm can come to him. His low estate protects him from danger, and I will guarantee him from persecution. Follow me; I will be your guide through these labyrinthine passages. You will soon be at liberty; but, O, Giulio, if you advance in arms against your native city, forget not that the poor inhabitants have done you no harm, and, if you are tempted to punish<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC7296-00000023"/> ish my poor father, remember it was his daughter set you free."</p>
                  <p>"I will never forget that he is your father, my guardian angel; my benefactress; my own true love!" cried the prince, passionately.</p>
                  <p>At this moment, the jailer returned.</p>
                  <p>"The time has expired," said he, looking doubtfully at Giulio and Margarita. "The prince must return to his cell."</p>
                  <p>"The prince does not return to his cell," said the princess, firmly. "He goes with me."</p>
                  <p>"But I dare not—"faltered the man.</p>
                  <p>"I dare assume the responsibility," said the princess. "And you dare not gainsay my authority. Have I not the signet ring? Only say nothing of this event. If the duke himself inquire respecting the prisoner, say that he is safe. To-morrow, early, I will place you beyond all reach of danger—and here, here," she tore off her priceless jewels and thrust them into his hand. "Here is an earnest of what I will do for you."</p>
                  <p>The sight of this unhoped for wealth vanquished all the scruples of the sordid jailer, with whom unsatisfied avarice had been a gnawing passion.</p>
                  <p>"Enough," he growled; "away with you—I will trust your promises—and my luck."</p>
                  <p>With a light and swift step the princess led away her ransomed lover, while the jailer, thrusting her gifts into his bosom, lay down again upon his bench coiled up like a dog. But he was not destined that night to enjoy the sweet boon of sleep. He had hardly closed his eyes again and begun to dream of the mines of Golconda, when a shake of the shoulder roused him to his feet. To his horror the Duke of Parma stood before him.</p>
                  <p>"Mattco," he asked, in a hoarse whisper.</p>
                  <p>"How is the prisoner?"</p>
                  <p>"When I went my rounds last, he was fast asleep," said the jailer, trembling lest the duke had come to visit him in person.</p>
                  <p>"It is well," said the duke. "Now hear me. The prisoner must never see the sun rise."</p>
                  <p>"Am I to get the block and axe ready?"</p>
                  <p>"No. He dies by a swifter and surer means. Take this phial," and the duke handed the jailer the potion he had received from the astrologer. "Put a few drops of this on every article of his food and in his wine—and serve him his meal at the gray of dawn. He eats well?"</p>
                  <p>"Freely, my lord."</p>
                  <p>"Ten minutes after he has partaken of his food, he will be a livid corpse."</p>
                  <p>The jailer listened attentively.</p>
                  <p>"In the meantime I have given orders for a suit of knightly armor to be prepared wherein to dress the corpse, and a coffin to enclose the remains. Now hear me—accomplish your mission faithfully, and I will make you rich—fail in it, and your head shall answer for your remissness."</p>
                  <p>"My lord," said the jailer, "your will shall be accomplished."</p>
                  <p>"Enough," replied the duke. "I know that I can trust you."</p>
                  <p>And, ghastly pale at the thought of the deed he had commanded, the duke retired to his palace, leaving the jailer overwhelmed with the responsibility that rested on him.</p>

               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE ESCAPE—THE JAILER'S PROJECT.</head>
                  <p>GIULIO, guided by Margarita, was conducted safely through the corridors of the prison into the palace, where there was less vigilance and less danger of observation. Yet she trembled every moment at the idea of a chance of detection. In passing from the prison to the palace, Giulio paused once. Hanging within reach on the wall of a narrow passage a sword was suspended. He detached it and felt a thrill of pleasure as he grasped the hilt of the familiar weapon. He could not resists drawing it and trying its temper. The blade was of Toledo workmanship—while it could be coiled up like a snake, the moment the compression ceased, it shot forth straight and true as an Indian arrow. Giulio glanced at the motto on the blade. It was the old Spanish one: "Never draw me without cause, nor sheathe me with dishonor."</p>
                  <p>"Dearest," said he, to the princess, "I will make bold to appropriate this weapon."</p>
                  <p>"Take it," said the princess. "Never could it be in better hands."</p>
                  <p>"I shall not be unmindful of the device on the blade," said the prince. "This steel may be reddened with blood—alas! but it shall not be crimsoned with shame."</p>
                  <p>"Hasten, prince! our time is precious."</p>
                  <p>Giulio checked her with one word.</p>
                  <p>"Estella!"</p>
                  <p>"I will inform her of your safety."</p>
                  <p>"I must see my sister, dearest, ere I leave these walls. I must have her parting kiss as well as thine, for a talisman."</p>
                  <p>"It is hazardous."</p>
                  <p>"I will not answer so much the better, for that were bravado, but I will say that I am willing to incur the risk."</p>
                  <p>The princess, then, not without some trepidation at the thought of the delay, ushered Giulio into a small room, the door of which was provided with bolt and bar, and having recommended him to fasten it, and agreed upon a signal by which she might make herself known on her return, hastened to her own apartment, where she found Estella buried in a tranquil sleep.</p>
                  <p>"Hist, Estella," she said, touching her very lightly.</p>
                  <p>The sleeper stirred.</p>
                  <p>"Giulio!" she murmured.</p>
                  <p>"It is of Giulio I wish to speak!" said the princess, arousing her.</p>
                  <p>"Is he safe? is he well?" asked Estella, starting up.</p>
                  <p>"Safe and well. But are you thoroughly awake?"</p>
                  <p>"Perfectly."</p>
                  <p>"And able to understand what I say?"</p>
                  <p>"I am broad awake, dear princess."</p>
                  <p>"Then rise, my love; wrap yourself in a cloak, and follow me quickly and silently."</p>
                  <p>Estella, who placed implicit confidence in her new friend, obeyed, and was soon prepared to accompany her.</p>
                  <p>The two lovely young women traversed the suite of apartments with rapid steps and soon stood before the door of the apartment in which Giulio was awaiting them. The princess clapped her hands thrice—the preconcerted signal; the door was opened, and Estella, with her friend, stood in the presence of her brother.</p>
                  <p>"Brother! dearest brother!" said Estella, as she rushed into his arms, "how happens it that you are free?"</p>
                  <p>"My liberator stands beside you," said the prince.</p>
                  <p>The embrace of the warm-hearted young girl was transferred to the princess, who blushed with pleasure and embarrassment as she received the tokens of gratitude.</p>
                  <p>"You meet but to part, Estella," she said, after a brief pause. "I must separate you."</p>
                  <p>"Separate us?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes—Giulio must fly."</p>
                  <p>"O, brother! take me with you!" cried Estella, clinging to his arm.</p>
                  <p>"Nay, dearest, I have dangers and perils to encounter."</p>
                  <p>"No matter."</p>
                  <p>"You would but impede my flight."</p>
                  <p>"Then indeed, I must remain," said Estella, with a sigh.</p>
                  <p>"You must; but we shall meet again shortly. I am sure of it," said the prince, earnestly. "Heaven has smiled upon me, and sent me a guardian angel in the midst of my enemies. I shall return, ere many hours, perhaps—I feel it—conquering and to conquer. My banner shall float gloriously on these very walls. Fear nothing. Now that I have seen you, dear sister, received your embrace, and felt the pressure of your lips, I go forth with a light heart."</p>
                  <p>"Farewell, then, dear brother, and may Heaven prosper you," said Estella.</p>
                  <p>"Remain here till my return," whispered the princess.</p>
                  <p>Once more, then, Giulio and his brave and gentle guide sallied forth. She took him to the confines of the palace yard, and opened a wicket for him to pass forth. She whispered in his ear the word that would carry him past the sentinels, minutely described the path that he must take, and then, as a last gift, bestowed upon him the duplicate ducal signet-ring she wore, only enjoining it on him not to use it, excepting in the most urgent need. A hurried expression of gratitude, fervent and sincere, though brief, a warm and close embrace, and the lovers parted—Giulio to try his fortune, and the princess to return with Estella to her chamber and await the progress of events.</p>
                  <p>But what has become of Matteo, the jailer, whom we left confounded by the parting injunctions of the duke? He sat on the bench holding the phial in his hand and racking his brain with perplexing questions and projects.</p>
                  <p>"What," thus ran the current of his thoughts, "What am I to do? I fear me I have run my neck into a halter, and thrust my hand into aniron glove too far to draw it back again. The princess has bestowed almost a fortune on me in these gems. What if I were to pitch these keys into the well and leave the prison to take care of itself? Impossible—I am forbidden to leave my post without a written order. I should be sent back; suspicion would be awakened; the whole would come out, and then the halter or the axe would be my reward. I must think of something better than that. Ha! I have it!" he thought, after a giant effort of his intellect.</p>
                  <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7296-00000024"/>
                  <p>"There is one chance to avoid detection, and only one. It is a forlorn hope, but it may succeed. The jester shall take the place of the prince. The duke said that Giulio must die before sunrise; therefore there must be great haste required in whatever scheme he is concocting. The body may be huddled into the grave without an examination or verification of identity. I am ready to swear to anything, and perhaps nothing more than my oath will be required. To be sure I have nothing against the poor fool—but a man must live—and I can't afford to be made a head shorter for him. It shall be done."</p>
                  <p>With these words the ruffian arose, and went to his appartment, where he prepared the materials for a substantial breakfast. Unsealing a flask of wine, he pourced several drops from the phial into it and then re-sealed it. A cold fowl was sprinkled with the liquid; several slices of bread were thus prepared—bunches of grapes and some dried figs also received the potions. Setting them out on a tray, he mingled with them a flask of unadulterated wine, and some bread and fruit, carefully marked so that he could identify the articles, and thus prepared sought the cell of the jester.</p>
                  <p>Tonio was buried in a profound sleep. Roused by a rough shake of the shoulder, he started up, and his eyes encountered the face of the jailer bending over him, and rendered more hideous by the ferocious grin he assumed in token of good fellowship.</p>
                  <p>"Come," said the jailer, "are you going to sleep all day? It's high time to be up and stirring."</p>
                  <p>"One never knows the difference between daylight and dark in this black hole," said the jester, obeying the summons. "But where is the prince?"</p>
                  <p>"O, he has been liberated," said the jailer, with what was intended to be a pleasant smile. "And I suppose you'll be sent for before long—for the duke, Heaven bless him!—told me to get you the best breakfast I could provide. And so I have brought you a regale fit for a prince of the blood. Bread as white as the snow on the Appenines; wine, to, you varlet—genuine Lachryma Christi—and such grapes! My own mouth waters; and, I' faith! I have e'en invited myself to breakfast with you."</p>
                  <p>"It must be a consoling reflection to you, my friend," said the jester, "to think, When you design a visit to any of your friends here, that you are sure to find them at home."</p>
                  <p>"Ho! ho! an excellent jest, i' faith," said the jester.</p>
                  <p>"Jesting is my trade, friend," said Tonio, "as yours is turning the key on better men than thyself."</p>
                  <p>"Come now, my employment is not quite so monotonous," said the jailer, "for I'm a favorite with my noble master, and sometimes, when the prisoner is to be tortured, I'm allowed my turn at the rack; and when the headsman is indisposed, I take his place on the scaffold. I've learned to handle the axe quite dexterously. And, my dear fellow, if your affairs should take an unlucky turn, I should solicit the pleasure of putting you out of your misery."</p>
                  <p>"Thank you," said the jester. "But I'd much rather breakfast at your expense, than have you take a chop at mine."</p>
                  <p>"Well, here's your breakfast all ready on this table," said Matteo. "Draw your stool close and I'll sit by you. I'm used to earving; which part of this fowl do you prefer?"</p>
                  <p>"I prefer the legs and wings, the breast, back and thigh, if you please," said the jester. "In a word, give me the whole bird."</p>
                  <p>"I'm glad you've so good an appetite," said the jailer.</p>
                  <p>"It's a chronic complaint with me," answered Tonio. "This is a capital chicken. Try some."</p>
                  <p>"I can't eat so early in the morning," said the jailer, excusing himself. "Here's a morsel of biscuit will serve my turn."</p>
                  <p>"This bread and fowl make me thirsty," said the jester, after eating heartily.</p>
                  <p>"Here's a bottle of capital wine," returned the jailer, breaking the seal and drawing the cork. "It has been in the duke's cellars for forty years."</p>
                  <p>"Fill up a cup for your trouble," said the jester.</p>
                  <p>"Thank ye—but I brought a brace of bottles of the same sort," replied the jailer. "There's one a-piece. Each to his flagon. Good luck to you."</p>
                  <p>"The same to you."</p>
                  <p>"Here's trade!" shouted the jailer.</p>
                  <p>"Ahem!" said the jester. "I can hardly drink to yours."</p>
                  <p>"Then here's wit and humor, and may they ever bring fortune to their possessor!" said the jailer filling his glass.</p>
                  <p>"Jailer!" said the jester growing suddenly affectionate, "you're an honest fellow—you've feasted me like a prince."</p>
                  <p>"Don't thank me for your entertainment," said the jailer, modestly, "but the duke, my master."</p>
                  <p>"Here's his good health!" cried the jester. "Faith! his breakfast has improved my opinion of him amazingly. I can't think he means to play me a knavish trick."</p>
                  <p>"He! bless you—he means well enough by you. He means to send you away this very morning."</p>
                  <p>"I could find it in my heart to hug you for your news!" said the jester, langnidly and yawsingly, for sleep had begun to creep over him.</p>
                  <p>"But, my dear fellow," he added, speaking with difficulty, "you woke me up too early. I hadn't had half sleep enough. I'm not an early riser; you mistook my habits."</p>
                  <p>"Why not go to bed again?" asked the jailer.</p>
                  <p>"Excellent—advice—jailer. I am—very—sleepy—and your wine—was confoundedly strong."</p>
                  <p>His eyes closed, and he fell back in his chair.</p>
                  <p>"So soon!" muttered the jailer. "It is wonderful!"</p>
                  <p>After his eyes were closed and his lips mute, there were one or two slight conculsive motions of Tonio's frame, after which all evidence of life was absent. As the jailer was contemplating this strange spectacle, he was startled by three heavy knocks at the cell-door. Bushing precipitately into the corridor to prevent, if possible, the entrance of the duke, he was relieved to find that the summons was not from his master. Two or three men in sad-colored liveries were there, who had brought a complete suit of plate armor, with the offensive weapons appertaining to the armament of a cavalier of rank, and a banner blazoned with the arms of Parma and shrouded with crape. They had also brought a coffin, which was now resting on a bier covered by a black pall.</p>
                  <p>The spokesman of this group of servitors now approached Matteo, and asked him if he required any assistance.</p>
                  <p>"No; I have plenty of my own," replied Matteo.</p>
                  <p>"The duke wishes to know how soon you will be ready."</p>
                  <p>"In half an hour," replied the jailer.</p>
                  <p>The attendants retired.</p>
                  <p>"I breathe freer," said the jailer. "I am saved. The duke will not discover the trick I put upon him till I am beyond the reach of danger."</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
                  <head type="sub">STRANGE SCENES AT THE GATE.</head>
                  <p>WE left Giulio parting from the princess, who had furnished him with every facility for making good his escape. Yet the desire of liberty was less imperative in his bosom than his passion for the lovely daughter of his enemy. To linger near her, even though fate rockoned the moments of life—to forget danger in the intoxication of her presence; these were follies his heart would have prompted him to enact, if his reason had not checked the impulse. Tightening his belt, then grasping the handle of his sword and satisfying himself that the blade played freely in the scabbard, so that it would leap forth to his touch on the occurrence of an emergency, he made his way to the city gates, through which his signetring and the assertion that he was a messenger of the duke, readily passed him. Striking into a little wood that crowned a little eminence within a few feet of the city walls, he paused for reflection, and deliberated whether he should immediately repair to the camp of the Milanese army or remain where he was and recomoitre the city.</p>
                  <p>He was inclined to think, that by adopting the latter course, he might discover some circumstances which might be turned to the advantage of his friends. He occupied a position from which he could look down on the ramparts of Parma, while at the same time, he could by changing his point of view, have a fair night of the camp the lines of which his practised eye could discover, beneath the gradually brightening sky streteching their dark array across the adjacent plain.</p>
                  <p>In the city an extraordinary activity reigned. He could hear the clash of weapons and the heavy tread of men-at-arms, as bodies of men were moved from point to point. Dark groups appeared on the walls, and now and then a torch moved along the lines of the defenders, as if an officer of rank were making an inspection. Meanwhile the sky grew gradually brighter—dawn was breaking in the east. Its chill gray gave place, by degrees, to a warmer hue, betokening the approach of the sun, and finally, bright, horizontal bars of gold along the horizon announced the immediate rising of the orb of day. As its disk shot above the horizon, the ducal banner of Parma was unfolded on the wall, its gorgeously emblazoned folds flashing back the sunbeams that sparkled on its surface. At this moment<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7296-00000025"/> the shout of "Long live Parma!" broke from the soldiery on the walls.</p>
                  <p>At the same time the camp of the Milanese army exhibited similar tokens of activity. Lances and steel armor glittered all over the plain. Mounted knights galloped here and there, distributing orders, and the ground shook as ponderous pieces of clumsy artillery, each drawn by many horses, were moved to the front. Before the splendid tent which Giulio recognized as the headquarters of the Duke of Milan, from a lofty standard staff, the ducal banner was flung out, as that of Parma had been upon the ramparts, while the exultant shout that greeted it, betokened the presence of a very formidable host.</p>
                  <p>And now the swarming masses of the Milanese begin to concentrate themselves and assume a military regularity of form. They were drawn up in three long lines, occupying the entire width of the plain, with heavy cannon at the intervals, and a broad passage through the centre of the lines. Through this passage there now swept as glorious a cavalcade as ever the sun shone down upon. First came a herald, attired in the splendid habiliments of his calling, surrounded by a band of trumpeters; then rode forth the Duke of Milan, mounted on a milk-white charger, and clad from head to heel in silver armor inlaid with gold, wearing golden spurs, and a splendid baldric glittering with precious stones. Beside him rode a standard bearer, carrying his banner, and he was followed by a large array of knights magnificently mounted and armed, and attended by their squires and pages. The road taken by the cavalcade led directly past the spot where Giulio had taken post. A few steps would have brought him to the feet of his kinsman, but he preferred to remain concealed and await for awhile the progress of events.</p>
                  <p>The glittering procession advanced to a short distance of the walls, halted, and then the herald, riding out from the foremost group, a parley was sounded on the trumpets. It was answered by a flourish from the ramparts.</p>
                  <p>The herald then, in the name of the Duke of Milan, asked for an interview with the Duke of Parma.</p>
                  <p>Ferrado Montaldo, presenting himself as the representative of the duke, answered that his master was unwell and unable to appear, and had commissioned him to parley and treat with the duke.</p>
                  <p>"There is little need of parley," replied the Duke of Milan, riding to the front. "Last night we sent an ultimatum to your master, viz., that at sunrise this morning our kinsman should be delivered into our hands. We received the assurance, and from your lips, that the request should be complied with. We have not hurried your preparations. Not till the sun had appeared above the horizon did we leave our lines. We now await the redemption of your promise."</p>
                  <p>"Alas, my lord!" replied Ferrado, "I am deeply pained—inexpressibly grieved to be the messenger of evil tidings. A heavy misfortune hath befallen us. The ways of Providence are inscrutable—in the midst of life we are in death!"</p>
                  <p>"Out on thy paltering delays, sirrah!" shouted the duke. "Cease prattling like a shaveling monk, and tell us at once, like a man and a soldier, what hath chanced."</p>
                  <p>At this point Giulio listened with the intensest curiosity, anxious to learn what story the Duke of Parma had conjured up to beguile the ear of Milan. What was his astonishment when he heard Ferrado's reply.</p>
                  <p>"My lord," faltered Montaldo, "it is my painful duty to inform you that the Prince Giulio is no more."</p>
                  <p>"Giulio no more!" cried the duke. "My kinsman dead! By Heaven, I believe it not. Men die not in their youth and health so suddenly, save in battle, unless foul play is wrought them. Go back to your master, and tell him that Conrado d'Este, Duke of Milan, proclaims him a liar, flouts the tale of his kinsman's decease, and defies him to mortal combat."</p>
                  <p>"My lord," said Montaldo, "were not allowance to be made for grief and disappointment, this conference should break off here. But I know what you feel. I loved Prince Giulio; all loved who knew him, and the intelligence of his death nearly unmanned me when it was communicated to me this morning. You even doubt the story of my friend's death, and I acknowledge that it needs confirmation. Alas! at this moment the proof is approaching."</p>
                  <p>Giulio listened and gazed in astonishment. He acquitted Ferrado of all intention of deception, and regarded him as the dupe of the Duke of Parma. But how this imposition was to be carried out to the end baffled his imagination. As he gazed from his hiding-place, however, he beheld the city gates opening, and forth, with the waving of the banners of the church, with monks walking bareheaded and barefooted, chanting a funeral dirge, with trumpets wailing low and mournfully, with soldiers marching with trailed arms, came forth a dismal procession escorting a coffin placed upon a velvet covered bier. Over it waved the ducal banner of Parma, shrouded with crape, and beside it walked Ferrado Montaldo, who had descended from the wall to do honor to the obsequies.</p>
                  <p>The procession advanced to the Duke of Milan, where it halted and set down the bier at the foot of his charger. Dismounting, the duke knelt beside the coffin and burst into a flood of tears.</p>
                  <p>"O, heavy day!" said he. "Giulio! Giulio! would that you could hear me. Would that you could hear me accuse myself of my long inaction and indifference to your cause. Proud eaglet of a royal race, thou shouldst have filled the eyrie where a foul kite now holds his state. But thou shalt not fill the grave unavenged."</p>
                  <p>Starting to his feet, he exclaimed:</p>
                  <p>"This is not a deed of Providence. It is a foul murder."</p>
                  <p>"And who is the murderer, my lord?" asked Ferrado.</p>
                  <p>"Thy master!" shouted the duke.</p>
                  <p>"I must not listen to this language," said Ferrado.</p>
                  <p>"Thou must bear it to thy master from me," said the duke. And tearing off his mailed gauntlet, he flung it at the feet of the equerry. "And with it," added the duke, "This my defiance and challenge to mortal combat."</p>
                  <p>Montaldo took up the gauntlet.</p>
                  <p>"I could not have chosen a fitter messenger," said the duke, "for thou art his accomplice in guilt."</p>
                  <p>"Thou shalt answer that charge at the sword's point," retorted Montaldo.</p>
                  <p>"What! fight with thee, vassal!" exclaimed the duke. "Only with his equals does Conrado d'Este deign to cross swords."</p>
                  <p>"I shall soon be thy equal, proud duke," answered Montaldo, "for know that I am to wed the Princess of Parma,"</p>
                  <p>"When thou art wed will be time enough to bandy words with me," said the indignant duke.</p>
                  <p>Without uttering another word, Montaldo, accompanied by the funeral escort, retired within the walls of the city, the gates of which were secured behind him.</p>
                  <p>"Giulio hath been foully dealt with," said the duke. "Quickly—an armorer here! and a skilful mediciner. We must examine the body on the spot."</p>
                  <p>At the summons, a surgeon and an armorer stepped forth. The latter, at a word from the duke, removed the coffin lid, while the former proceeded to an examination of the body.</p>
                  <p>"He is not dead, my lord! He lives!" said the leech, after a hasty examination.</p>
                  <p>"Raise him up! give him air!" cried the duke, rushing forward. "Remove the visor of his helmet."</p>
                  <p>His orders were promptly obeyed, and the removal of the casque gave to view the bewildered countenance of the jester.</p>
                  <p>"Tonio!" exclaimed the duke. "How came the fool there?"</p>
                  <p>"That is precisely the question the fool was about to ask your grace,"said the jester. "I go to bed in my fool's motley, after a hearty breakfast in a prisoner's cells, and I wake up, changed into a knight, and about to be buried alive, for aught I know. A very pleasant fellow, that same jailer of his grace of Parma, my lord, but his wine is confounded strong."</p>
                  <p>The Duke of Milan stamped his foot, while his cheek and brow burned crimson with rage.</p>
                  <p>"This is a deadly affront!" he exclaimed.</p>
                  <p>"To pledge me the return of my kinsman, and then not only to break his word, but to insult me with this farce! Dearly shall the traitor duke me his insolence."</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile Tonio had been assisted from his uncomfortable resting-place and stood upon his feet. Whether the astrologer had made a mistake in compounding his potion, or whether, as is more likely, the wine and food the jester had swallowed had some qualities that neutralized its potency, certain it is that the effects of the narcotic were much more transitory than had been anticipated. The jester yawned, rubbed his eyes, stretched himself as well as his unwonted apparel would admit, and then he appeared almost perfectly recovered.</p>
                  <p>"Where is your master, knave?" said the duke, sternly, for he visited some of his displeasure on the unconscious instrument of the deception which had been practised upon him.</p>
                  <p>"That I know not, noble duke." replied the jester. "I was placed in his cell and fell asleep beside him. In the morning, when the Jailer awoke me, he assured me that the prince had been set at liberty; and furthermore your deponent knoweth not."</p>
                  <p>"I have heard enough," cried the duke. "Return with me to the camp, and prepare for the assault. If harm hath chanced to one hair of my kinsman's head, I will not leave one stone upon another of this accursed city. The very<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7296-00000026"/> ground shall be ploughed up and salt sown thereon, so that not a blade of grass shall mark its utter loneliness and ruin."</p>
                  <p>He sprang upon his charger, the trumpets rang out a bold defiance to the city, and the glittering <foreign xml:lang="FRA">cortege</foreign> returned at a sharp trot to the camp.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">EXPLANATIONS.—A HOSTILE MEETING.</head>
                  <p>DESCENDING from the outer wall of the city, without waiting for the opening of the coffin, which indeed, as it took place surrounded by the suite of the Duke of Milan, was witnessed only by himself and followers, and by Giulio from his hiding place, and was invisible to the officers and troops of the town, Ferrado Montaldo mounted his horse, rode directly to the palace and was admitted to the presence of the duke, who was a waiting his return with great anxiety—an anxiety by no means dispelled by the stern and servere expression of the commandant's countenance.</p>
                  <p>"Well, Ferrado, what news?" asked the duke.</p>
                  <p>"I surrendered the body of the unfortunate prince to his kinsman," replied Ferrado, "with an honorable escort befitting his rank; with holy priests walking beside his remains, with cross and banner displayed, and soldiers marching with reversed arms beside one, who, if living, would bravely have led them forth to battle."</p>
                  <p>"Enough of this eulogy," said the duke, impatiently. "What said our cousin of Milan? He was overwhelmed with grief and astonishment?"</p>
                  <p>"He manifested less of either than indignation," replied Ferrado. "He accused you of foul play, as I myself did this morning, until you pledged your word as a sovereign and a knight, that Giulio had died a natural death, and that your physician stood ready to testify to the fact."</p>
                  <p>"You so assured his grace of Milan?" said the duke.</p>
                  <p>"He gave me no opportunity," replied Ferrado, "but flung defiance in my face. He threw down his gauntlet, defying you to mortal combat—I took up the gage of battle, and here it is."</p>
                  <p>With these words, Ferrado laid the mailed gauntlet on the marble table beside the duke.</p>
                  <p>"You should have let it lie where he flung it," said the duke.</p>
                  <p>"I am a soldier, sire," replied Ferrado, briefly, "though I have yet my spurs to win. But," he added, "opportunity enough will soon be afforded me."</p>
                  <p>"How so?" inquired the duke.</p>
                  <p>"How so? The whirlwind you have provoked is now rising. See if you can lull its fury. You rejected my counsel; now reap the benefit of your own."</p>
                  <p>"You assume a lofty tone, Ferrado."</p>
                  <p>"I speak frankly and bluntly. If my manner displeases you, you can command me to lay down my commission and resign my sword."</p>
                  <p>"Nay, nay, Ferrado, I like your frankness," hurriedly replied the duke. "Resign! you are my sole reliance. Beat back these minious of Milan, and the half of all my treasure is yours."</p>
                  <p>"I am no mercenary," replied Ferrado. "I will fight because they come as enemies to my country, and because, in so doing, you have assured me, nay, have sworn, that I am not upholding <emph>crime.</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"I have so sworn," said the duke, faintly. "Now, go to my daughter. Take your leave of her; she loves you—a parting word from her will nerve your arm in battle."</p>
                  <p>Ferrado bowed, and, availing himself of the permission, or rather command of the duke, passed to the apartments of the princess to which he was readily admitted. As he entered her presence, her attendants, on a sign from her, retired.</p>
                  <p>"Beauteous lady," said Ferrado, "I come from your father."</p>
                  <p>"I have but lately returned from an interview with him," replied the princess, blushing deeply, and trembling as she spoke.</p>
                  <p>"Lady," said the knight, "I come armed with his permission to address you."</p>
                  <p>"My father's commands are my law," said the princess. "To every wish of his, duty compels me to yield obedience."</p>
                  <p>Ferrado bowed, yet as he made no reply, the princess continued:</p>
                  <p>"But there are exceptions to this rule of obedience. I recognize no power in my father to jeopardize the happiness of my entire future. He can claim my love, my service as a daughter, but he cannot mortgage for me the wealth of my young heart's affections. He cannot bid me bind myself at the altar to link my fate forever to one to whom my heart is not surrendered. Ah, signor, the lot of a peasant girl is happier far than that of us high-born ladies. Few have the courage to protest against the tyranny of custom, as I have done. Ferrado Montaldo—I esteem and respect you, but brave and worthy as you are, I cannot love you."</p>
                  <p>"Princess of Parma," replied Ferrado, looking up in her eyes, "I know of none lovelier than thou in this fair land of Italy—and would maintain the assertion at my lance-point. In your service I would do all that a knight may dare, but truth compels me to declare that my heart is given to another."</p>
                  <p>"We are friends then," said the princess, joyously, "and here is my hand in pledge of it."</p>
                  <p>Ferrado raised the fair hand of the princess to his bearded lip and kissed it respectfully.</p>
                  <p>"Let there be no secrets between us," said the princess, "for we must be fast allies. The love I denied to you, I have bestowed upon another; I blush not to confess it—our kinsman, the Prince Giulio."</p>
                  <p>"Prince Giulio!" exclaimed Ferrado. "And yet I behold you joyous and exultant."</p>
                  <p>"Why not? He is no longer a prisoner. Hark in thine ear, Ferrado. I will give thee the highest proof of my confidence. Last night I set the prisoner free; gave to him a passport that ensures his safety, and he is now far removed from danger."</p>
                  <p>"Then whose body was it," exclaimed Ferrado, "that I this morn, by order of the duke, surrendered to his grace of Milan?"</p>
                  <p>"What is this you say, Ferrado?" cried the princess, turning pale.</p>
                  <p>"This morning a coffin with the arms of Parma was brought me from the prison. I was told that Prince Giulio had died suddenly during the night; your father swore by the visitation of God and not by violence—and that body I surrendered to the Milanese."</p>
                  <p>"It was some other unfortunate," said the princess.</p>
                  <p>"Yet your father believes it was the prince."</p>
                  <p>"Ha!" said the lady, after a moment's reflection. "I begin to see through this mystery. Matteo, the jailer, whose connivance I was compelled to purchase, contrived this deception to ensure his own safety."</p>
                  <p>"It must be so," said Ferrado. "Thank Heaven and thee, lady, that Giulio is safe. I can do my duty as a soldier with a clear conscience. Farewell, signora; I must to the walls."</p>
                  <p>"But not before you bid farewell to one to whose heart you are dearer than a brother."</p>
                  <p>The princess vanished as she spoke, but in her place stood the radiant figure of Estella.</p>
                  <p>Ferrado threw himself at her feet.</p>
                  <p>"Lady," said he, "these may be my last words. I go to repel an assault upon the city; if I fall in the storm; let me at least have the consciousness that I told you that I loved you, and that you did not rebuke the boldness."</p>
                  <p>"Dear, dear Ferrado," murmured Estella.</p>
                  <p>The mailed warrior sprang to his feet and clasped her in his arms.</p>
                  <p>"Now," he exclaimed, "I care not what chances. If I fall, at least I have been happy, if even for a moment; and that moment an eternity of bliss."</p>
                  <p>At that moment the loud blast of a trumpet echoed through the vaulted apartment.</p>
                  <p>"I must be gone," said the soldier.</p>
                  <p>"Farewell," said the weeping maiden. "May Heaven protect you! Should you meet with Giulio, forget not that he is my brother."</p>
                  <p>Ferrado sprang from her presence and descended to the street. Ere we follow him it will be necessary to return to Prince Giulio, whom we left astounded and indignant at the series of events he had witnessed from his hiding-place. But for one thing he would have gone down and made himself known to his kinsman, and joined the ranks of his friends. That one consideration was the assertion, extorted from Ferrado by the taunt of the Duke of Milan, that he was to wed the Princess of Parma, and thus become the equal of his opponent in rank. We have just seen how little real foundation there was for Giulio's jealousy; but it must be confessed that lighter words have stung a lover's sould to madness. Therefore, instead of joining his friends, and taking his chance of entering the city by assault, he determined to avail himself of the power of entering at his will bestowed upon him by the princess. It is true that he might have introduced followers by the same means, but his noble nature scorned to stoop to such a perversion of the princess's generosity; and he resolved, alone, to go back to the midst of his enemies, and to try to learn the exact relations of Ferrado and the lady of his heart. Therefore, after the train of the duke had retired, he emerged from his retreat and making a long circuit, approached the city by one of the side entrances, and without difficulty secured a passage by the exhibition of his signet-ring.</p>
                  <p>Once within the walls he was able to proceed without notice, for the attention of the inhabitants was too much taken up with the alarm of an attack to allow it to be diverted by the appearance of a single and plainly <unclear>attired</unclear> individual. Men were parting from their wives and children; soldiers moving along in squads;<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7296-00000027"/> mounted knights galloping to and fro, and bugles ringing in every direction.</p>
                  <p>As Giulio pressed forward towards the palace, regardless of his personal danger, and thinking only of the princess and her supposed lover, he suddenly encountered Selim, the page.</p>
                  <p>"You here!" she exclaimed. "I thought you were beyond danger; for I wrung from Matteo the secret of your evasion. Yet you were the man of all others I could have wished to meet. Step aside with me into the shadow of this archway. I have that to impart which you must learn at once."</p>
                  <p>Giulio followed the page, his heart beating with vague and inexplicable fears.</p>
                  <p>"Whence come you, Selim?" he asked, with a faltering voice.</p>
                  <p>"From the princess's apartment," replied Zelie.</p>
                  <p>"Where you have been playing the eavesdropper?"</p>
                  <p>Giulio's remark was made at random. Zelie blushed deeply.</p>
                  <p>"It was from a good motive," she murmured.</p>
                  <p>"And what heard you?" he asked; for jealousy craves for its food, no matter how obtained.</p>
                  <p>"I saw and heard Ferrado press his suit. I heard him tell her that he came to her with the sanction of her father. To which the princess made reply—the very words dwell in my memory—My father's commands are law: to every wish of his, duty compels me to yield obedience. I heard no more. It was enough for me, and I left them together alone to plight their mutual vows."</p>
                  <p>"Swear that thou hast spoken the truth," said Giulio, in a hoarse voice.</p>
                  <p>"I will not swear by the cross," said Zelie, as Giulio offered the cross-hilt of his sword to her lips, "for that oath were not binding on my conscience. It is not the symbol of my faith."</p>
                  <p>"What oath then <emph>is</emph> binding on your conscience?" asked Giulio, startled by this bold avowal of infidelity.</p>
                  <p>"An oath in the name of the prophet of Allah," replied the pretended page. "By my hopes of earthly bliss, of heaven hereafter, by all that man holds dear and holy, I swear that I have faithfully reported to you the meeting and the words of the princess and Montaldo."</p>
                  <p>"Then hear me swear that I will be avenged on one or both of them," said the prince.</p>
                  <p>"Be it so," said the page. "But whither are you going?"</p>
                  <p>"To the palace."</p>
                  <p>"To certain death!" cried the page.</p>
                  <p>"I care not—so that it leads to my revenge."</p>
                  <p>"I can aid you to secure vengeance," said the page, slowly. "But you need not throw away your life. Await my return in this spot, where you are safe. If I come not back in twenty minutes, follow your own plans."</p>
                  <p>"Zelie raised the prince's hand to her lips and kissed it; then vanished with a light footstep."</p>
                  <p>Half of the appointed time had passed away, when Giulio, listening eagerly for every sound, heard a heavy footstep. Looking forth from the archway in which he was ensconced, he beheld Ferrado alone and moving forward with as rapid a step as his armor would permit.</p>
                  <p>"Ferrado Montaldo!" cried Giulio, in a voice so changed with passion, that the equerry did not recognize it, "halt!"</p>
                  <p>"Who calls me?" cried Montaldo. "I am in haste."</p>
                  <p>"Giulio Veroni," was the reply.</p>
                  <p>"The Prince Giulio! here!" exclaimed Montaldo, hurrying into the archway. "By what chance—"</p>
                  <p>"I exchange no words with traitors," interrupted Giulio. "Draw, villain, and defend thyself."</p>
                  <p>"The names of villain and Montaldo were never coupled yet," replied the young soldier.</p>
                  <p>"But from you I hear them without anger. In what have I offended you?"</p>
                  <p>"A coward as well as a traitor!" cried Giulio. "Will nothing move you?" and the prince struck Ferrado a furious blow with the flat of his sword.</p>
                  <p>Ferrado's weapon quickly flashed in the air, and a fierce combat instantly ensued—unequal, because Ferrado was equipped at all points, while the prince wore no defensive armor. A moment, however served to cool the passion of the former—he remembered in time with whom he was engaged, and disarming his antagonist, held him completely at his mercy.</p>
                  <p>"Finish your work now, and slay me," said the prince. "I have no desire to live."</p>
                  <p>"Live—noble prince," said Ferrado, generously. "Live to repeat the wrong you have done may honor. I would fain linger and explain whatever appearances may be against me—but time presses—the troops are clamorous for my presence. Adieu! we shall meet again."</p>
                  <p>With these words Montaldo continued the course this incident had interrupted, while Giulio, picking up his dishonored sword, and resolved to wait no longer for the page, made the best of his way to the palace.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE SECRET CHAMBER.</head>
                  <p>BUT, though Giulio was half crazed with jealousy and passion, he was not bewildered to that extent as utterly to lose sight of his own safety. Stopping at a small shop or booth kept by a Jew, he exchanged his sad-colored cloak for one of a brighter hue, and his light cap for another, the broad brim and drooping feathers of which effectually concealed his face, and formed, indeed, an efficient disguise except upon the very closest examination. Tossing a handful of ducats to the astounded and delighted Isaraelite, Giulio continued his way to the palace, nursing his moody and wrathful thoughts, and chafed by his recent defeat. He was near one of the entrances of the pile, when he suddenly encountered the page, issuing forth.</p>
                  <p>"You here?" exclaimed Zelie, almost angrily. "I thought I told you to remain under the archway."</p>
                  <p>"I am master of my own actions," replied the prince, haughtily. "Stand aside, boy, and let me pass."</p>
                  <p>"You should not have come hither; I would soon have joined you. Has anything happened?"</p>
                  <p>"Montaldo passed the archway."</p>
                  <p>"He saw you not!" cried the page, anxiously.</p>
                  <p>"Nay—I called to him."</p>
                  <p>"Then he explained himself."</p>
                  <p>"Our intercourse was limited to the crossing of steel blades."</p>
                  <p>"You are hurt," said the page, springing forward.</p>
                  <p>"Not in body," replied the prince, gloomily, "but wounded in spirit. Montaldo was victorious."</p>
                  <p>"A knight armed cap-a-pie Could hardly be otherwise. But why are you here?"</p>
                  <p>"I would see the princess."</p>
                  <p>"Then go to certain death. The palace is full of your enemies—you will be recognized—slain! The princess will be the first to betray you."</p>
                  <p>"I care not. I must see her and upbraid her with her perfidy."</p>
                  <p>"Do that when, side by side with your kinsman of Milan, victory perches on your banner, and you enter these walls as a conqueror."</p>
                  <p>"I cannot endure the delay. Besides, my sister is in their power, and I must know and share her fate."</p>
                  <p>"You will not see the princess now," persisted Zelio. "She is preparing her for her wedding with Montaldo, which, her father says, must take place immediately."</p>
                  <p>"I will find her, if in so doing I forfeit my existence."</p>
                  <p>"Then I must guide and shield you," said the page; "follow me."</p>
                  <p>Submitting to the leadership of the supposed boy, Giulio followed without hesitation. Zeke opened a wicket gate that gave entrance to the garden, and passing through an alley concealed and shaded by dense foliage, unlocked a door in the wall. They were then at the foot of a staircase, which they ascended and soon stood within the princess's apartments. They were deserted. Neither Margarita nor any of her attendants, nor the prince's sister were visible.</p>
                  <p>"You perceive," said Zelio, "that I did not deceive you. But follow still; I will procure you an interview."</p>
                  <p>She now approached a picture on the wall, and pressing a spring, the panel on which it was painted slid back, disclosing an opening upon a staircase. Passing through, followed by Giulio, Zelie closed the panel, and then, assuming the lead, first giving her hand to the prince, for the passage was not lighted, he was conducted up a short flight of steps and into a small and neatly furnished room.</p>
                  <p>"Rest here awhile," she said, "while I go in quest of the lady. Observe the door through which I pass. When you hear the tinkling of a silver bell, you can follow me—but not before. Do not neglect my request as you did once this morning."</p>
                  <p>The page vanished and Giulio sat down to await the signal with all the patience he could summon to his aid. More excitement and adventure had been crowded into the last two days of his life, than he had experienced in his whole previous existence, and so strange was the series of events in which he had become involved, that it was hard to persuade himself that all that passed around him was not a feverish dream, and that he should awaken in the peaceful and tranquil solitudes of Monte Rosa. He had about reconciled himself to the monotony of his existence there, when the duke's hunting party came to disturb his equanimity. Then came the lovely vision of the fairies glen—the love at first night<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7296-00000028"/> of the beautiful stranger—the arrest at midnight—the dungeon—the escape—and now these torturing doubts of the fidelity of one for whom he would have poured out his life blood "as freely as flask gives its wine." If her treachery were confirmed, he thought, no matter what became of him. He would surrender himself to the duke, and lay his head upon the block without a murmur. These reflections were interrupted by the talkling of the silver bell that summoned him to the adjoining apartment. He sprang up, rushed through the doorway by which the page had vanished, and then stood transformed at the spectacle which presented itself to his eye.</p>
                  <p>He stood within a small apartment, fitted up with the utmost luxury, but with peculiar taste. It was draped throrughout with hangings of rich blue Genoa velvet, heavily fringed with gold bultion, and gathered in the centre of the ceiling, from which it descended in rich and graceful folds, forming a tent. The floor was piled with Turkey carpets so that a footstep awakened no echo. In the centre was a magnificient divan, and near it standing on the floor, a vast alabaster lamp, fed with perfumed oil, diffused light and fragrance through the apartment. These features the quick eye of the prince took in at a glance, but it was not these which excited his astonishment.</p>
                  <p>Reclining on the divan in the centre of the room, was a lady of surpassing loveliness. On her head she wore a turban of emerald green silk, encircled by a bandead of precious stones which held up a veil of gold issue that fell like a cloud around her, importing a warm sint to her polished shoulders, like that observed in Titian's pictures of Venetian loveliness. A short, rose-colored tonic of satin, covered with fanciful gold embroidery, in the flowers of which sparkled diamonds and rubies, descended just below the knee, where it disclosed full trowsers of blue satin, gathered at the bottom by gold anklets set with precious stones, while the little fairy blue-veined feet Just rested in slippers that Cinderella might have worn. Resting carelessly upon her elbow, the right hand of the lady, Sparkling with jewelled rings, played with the flexible tube of a nargillah, or Turkish pipe, the bowl of which, curiously carved and ornamented, was set in a crystal was that stood upon a mat at the foot of the divan. The dark eyes of the lady, that shamed the lustre of the diamonds on her brow, gased piercingly upon the prince, as if to estimate the effect of this display.</p>
                  <p>For a few moments Giulio was speechless. At last he spoke.</p>
                  <p>"Lady," he said, "I feel that I am an intruder here. I came hither in quest of another than yourself, and it appears that I have been misled by a mischievous page."</p>
                  <p>"The page is gone," said the lady, with a slight smile and in the most melodious of voices. "His mission is accomplished—he will never appear upon the stage of life again; but in the place of Selim, the page, can you not accept Zelie, the Persian maiden, equally devoted to your service?"</p>
                  <p>The eyes of the prince had now become accustomed to the light. Scrutiniting the features of the personage before him, and coupling the result of that scrutiny with the reply of the female, his mind was instantly enlightened.</p>
                  <p>"You, then, beautiful girl—were the page of the princess?" he said.</p>
                  <p>"No other, prince. But name not the princess, she is unworthy your mention."</p>
                  <p>"And what could have induced you, Zelie, since so I must name you, to lay aside the garments of your sex, and accept a menial occupation—you, whose beauty should command Service rather than accord it?"</p>
                  <p>"It was to serve my father."</p>
                  <p>"Your father!"</p>
                  <p>"Sit down, prince, and you shall hear my story."</p>
                  <p>Giulio, strangely faseinated, accepted the invitation, or, rather, obeyed the command, for it was uttered with the tone of one used to secure obedience, and took a seat on the divan beside Zelie.</p>
                  <p>"I first saw light," said Zelie, "in that far Eastern clime whose flowers and trees, and groves and birds and fountains tell us what Paradise must have been in the first dawn of creation. I never knew my mother, for she died at my birth, but my father lavished on me more than a mother's tenderness. He was learned in all the lore of the East; a knowledge which makes the scholarship of your wise men appear like the lessons of schoolboys. His life has been passed in reading the profoundest secrets of nature; the story of the stars, the mysteries of earth. But it was not for the sake of that knowledge alone that he gathered the traditions of the Eastern magi, that he pored over the Egyptian scrolls, that he lingered long years on the banks of the Ganges and the Nile. His is a two-fold dream of wealth and empire. Gold for himself—gold for me; a gorgeous Eastern home for both. Such were his aims. In pursuit of this wealth, unsatisfied with the hoards he had already amassed, he came to the West, and circumstances induced him to visit Parma. The wise man who would become wealthy must not despise the arts of the charlatan. As a professed astrologer, he had need to gather by a sure and unsuspected hand, a knowledge of all that was passing in the world he seemed to disdain, and yet which it was necessary he should become thoroughly acquainted with. Hence his daughter became his instrument, and appeared at the court as a boy engaged for the service of the princess. A sad and humiliating life and task I assumed, you will say. So be it; but remember that the end justified the means. A heavy bribe procured from the architect who had been employed in the repairs of the palace, a thorough knowledge of all the secret chambers, passages and modes of communication with which these Italian structures abound; and we know far more of these material mysteries than the duke himself. How we avail ourselves of these secrets you yourself have partially witnessed. Suffice it to say, that my father's purpose has been accomplished. He is master of untold wealth. The duke, in view of approaching dangers, has given him permission to remove with his treasure to a place of safety. I need not tell you that we shall never return. Our faces are turned to the East, the cradle of our race, the home of fiery hearts and gorgeous dreams, and all the felicity that earth can bestow. I have nearly told my story, but not quite."</p>
                  <p>Zelie paused, and appeared agitated, as if expecting that the prince would speak; but as he remained silent, she resumed:</p>
                  <p>"Do you recognize this ring?" she asked, offering her hand to Giulio.</p>
                  <p>The prince bent down, and without touching the fair hand, replied that he recognized the trinket as that he had bestowed on her in the dungeon.</p>
                  <p>"The gift bestowed upon the boy was treasured by the woman," said the strange girl.</p>
                  <p>Still Giulio was silent.</p>
                  <p>"Could you think that it was a boy's devotion that prompted me to brave danger and fatigue for your sake?" asked Zelie, appealingly.</p>
                  <p>"Whatever the motive, lady," replied the prince, "I shall always be deeply grateful for the service."</p>
                  <p>"That service was rendered because I loved you, prince," exclaimed Zelie. "That ring was treasured that I might have the right to say to you one day, as I say to you now—in your darkest hour there was but one to serve you, and now she claims your love as her recompense."</p>
                  <p>"You forget there was another," said Giulio."The princess."</p>
                  <p>"The princess!" exclaimed Zelie, angrily. "She served you in her father's interest. She knew full well that your imprisonment was more dangerous to him than your liberty. Policy spoke to her false Italian heart and she obeyed."</p>
                  <p>"I am convinced you wrong her," said Giulio.</p>
                  <p>"Do I wrong her when I did you compare her loveliness with mine?" cried Zelie, with flashing eyes. "When I boldly challenge the comparison?"</p>
                  <p>"Zelie!" exclaimed the prince, "in this brief interview a sudden light has broken upon me. I came hither, doubting the lady of my love; I leave you, aware of the motive that has induced you to traduce her, and sorrowful that one so gifted, to whom I owe such gratitude, should stoop to arts so unworthy."</p>
                  <p>"Ferrado Montaldo loves the princess," said Zelie, starting up wildly. "He loves her—they will be wedded."</p>
                  <p>"I believe it not," said Giulio, firmly. "Farewell!"</p>
                  <p>"You leave me not," said Zelie, as the prince moved towards the door. "That way lies danger—death! Here, with us, life and happiness—all is arranged for our flight. Go with us. You will be happy. I will be your bride, your slave. You shall tear off those fettering garments and wear the turban of the Moslem. You shall renounce your false religion and kneel, with us, at the shrine of the prophet."</p>
                  <p>She seized the arm of the prince and clung to it with tenacity.</p>
                  <p>"Come, come to my father," she gasped. "He will bless our loves."</p>
                  <p>"Temptress avaunt!" cried Giulio, shaking off her grasp. "Were the Princess Margarita lost to me, you could not be mine. Between me and the there lies a gulf—profound—impossible!"</p>
                  <p>With a wild cry, that seemed the agony of a breaking heart, Zelie relinquished her hold upon the prince's arm, and reeling backward as if death-stricken, fell upon the divan. Giulio dashed through the door, plunged down the dark, stone stairway, and a fortunate chance guiding his hand, touched the spring of the secret panel, and had the satisfaction of seeing it fly back.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
                  <head type="sub">MUTUAL EXPLANATIONS.</head>
                  <p>THE Princess Margarita uttered a cry of astonishment and pain when she beheld Giulio, pale with excitement, suddenly appear before her. She sprang towards him and clasped his hands in both of hers.</p>
                  <p>"How is this, Giulio? Whence come you? How is it that you are here in the heart of danger again? Was my protection of no avail? Has the signet-ring lost its power?"</p>
                  <p>"I should never have left these walls," answered Giulio. "Of what avail to liberate my body, while my heart remained prisoner? Yet I come not back as I went forth, princess. You have a right to scorn me now. I have fought Montaldo, and been foiled."</p>
                  <p>"Fought Montaldo? Surely, Giulio, you are mad. He is your best friend, and should be near to you as a brother; for he loves your sister."</p>
                  <p>"He love Estella!"</p>
                  <p>"Yes; this morning he confessed it."</p>
                  <p>"And she?"</p>
                  <p>"Confided to him that she loved him in return. He went from her presence, promising to spare you should he cross your path in the assault."</p>
                  <p>"He did spare me," said Giulio. "I encountered him this morning, challenged him, struck him, though he was sheathed in steel, and compelled him to defend himself. He might have slain me, but he scorned to take advantage of my rashness."</p>
                  <p>"But the motives for assaulting him?"</p>
                  <p>"The belief that he was to receive your hand as the guerdon of his service to your father."</p>
                  <p>"And did you think for one moment, Giulio," said the princess, reproachfully, "that I could prove false to my plighted troth? Ah! how weak is the trust of man compared to that of woman."</p>
                  <p>"Margarita," said the prince, "jealousy is the surest test of love. There were other circumstances that combined to shake my reason—for it was a mental aberration—for a moment. Your page—your page who had already saved my life, who had no apparent motive for deception, who had given the highest proof of his attachment to me—he, I say, swore to me that he knew you were lost to me and plighted to another."</p>
                  <p>"The false traducer knew better. Strange that so young a boy's heart should be so full of evil."</p>
                  <p>"I have a stranger tale yet for your ear," said the prince. "That page is not what he seems."</p>
                  <p>"A spy?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes; a spy upon all your actions. But, Margarita, the worst remains to be told; your page, that was a boy, as it seemed—is a woman."</p>
                  <p>"A woman!"</p>
                  <p>"Ay, a woman—beautiful, passionate, vengeful, unprincipled. Moreover, she is the enemy of our faith, a follower of the false prophet."</p>
                  <p>"Selim!" exclaimed the princess.</p>
                  <p>"Selim no more, but Zelie, daughter of the duke's astrologer."</p>
                  <p>"Giulio, you have furnished me with the key to a dark mystery. This woman, who traduced me to you, sought to shake my confidence in you. An unknown female came to my chamber in the night-time."</p>
                  <p>"She and her father know a hundred secret passages by which they can pass from one part of the palace to another unseen and unsuspected."</p>
                  <p>"This mysterious female presented herself as your affianced bride," pursued the princess.</p>
                  <p>"In proof of which she showed me a ring which you had worn on your finger."</p>
                  <p>"It was the same which I bestowed upon the page in my dungeon, at his or her request. Thus, then, the clouds which threatened to darken our happiness, are swept away."</p>
                  <p>"No, Giulio—they were never darker," said the princess, tears filling her eyes. "For my sake you have rushed back into the heart of danger. Escape is no longer possible. The duke has given orders that none leave these walls without his permission. The signet-ring is no longer a talisman, and I, alas! have lost the power to protest you."</p>
                  <p>Tears filled her eyes, and her lips quivered as she made this acknowledgment.</p>
                  <p>"No matter," said Giulio. "Your father can do his worst. I will no longer fly from his wrath. Let him destroy me if he dare. I will no longer owe my safety to a woman's protection; I will go to the duke and surrender myself to him, and let him work his pleasure on this poor frame. He may send me to the block, and if Heaven designs that I shall perish, the light of love will gild my last moments like a parting sunbeam."</p>
                  <p>"You shall not throw away your life," said the princess. "If my words are unavailing, there is another advocate who shall plead with me for my cause."</p>
                  <p>She threw open the door from another room, and Estella rushed into her brother's arms.</p>
                  <p>"Dear Estella," said the prince, as he folded her to his heart. "I thank Heaven for this moment's meeting. It may be our last, sweetest; but we shall not part without my blessing on your fair young head. Mourn not for me when I am gone. Montaldo shall teach you to forget your grief, and you will think only of your brother as one, who, after a few painful trials, passed to a better world."</p>
                  <p>"What is the meaning of these sad words, dear brother?" asked the weeping girl.</p>
                  <p>"It means that, unless you can dissuade him, your brother will surrender himself to the duke, to be dealt with as he pleases. My father is now an angry and a desperate man."</p>
                  <p>"Giulio!" exclaimed Estella, "brother, dear brother, you have no right to peril your life. <emph>Your</emph> life, did I say. Are not our lives linked indissolubly with yours? Do nothing rash. Be counselled by the princess. She has wisdom and power."</p>
                  <p>"Estella—Margarita," said the prince, "you have vanquished my scruples. I place myself in your hands, well knowing that neither of you will counsel my dishonor."</p>
                  <p>"I thank you for your generous confidence, Giulio," said the princess. "You know well that your honor is as dear to me as your life. Hear me. I must conceal you for the present. Not here—the place is too insecure—but in the very last place where you will be looked for—in the prison from which you escaped. I myself will be your jailer. Mattco, besotted with wine, now sleeps as if he were dead. The prison, beneath my control, will be a sure fortress, and ere harm can come to you, I will devise some means to conjure away every danger. What think you of my plan?"</p>
                  <p>"I will not allow myself to think," said the prince. "I place my fate in your hands. You are wiser, better and truer than I am. When an angel interests herself in the fate of a mortal, the issue cannot but be fortunate."</p>
                  <p>With one more embrace bestowed upon his sister, Giulio abandoned himself to the guidance of the princess, who led the way from the palace to the prison. They found Matteo slumbering heavily upon his accustomed bench near the portal, and the princess easily possessed herself of the keys. She then resumed her way along a far-reaching corridor, followed by the prince, and paused before a cell long unoccupied.</p>
                  <p>"I will not place you in your former apartment," said she, "for I alone must know where to find you. There are duplicate keys to this cell. One I will keep myself—take thou the other; and if, before the day has closed, I do not come to liberate you, then you will know that the worst has chanced, and that the means of escape are in your own hands. Farewell—be of good cheer. Heaven will not desert us in our need."</p>
                  <p>With one embrace they parted; the prince entered the cell, and Margarita, after turning the key, withdrew it, and, hurrying back along the corridor, replaced the bunch from which she had abstracted the two keys beside the sleeping jailer. This done she returned to her apartments with all possible speed.</p>
                  <p>She had scarcely reached it and exchanged a few words with Estella, when Zelie presented herself in her page's dress. She was pale as death, with dark circles under her eyes, but her manner was as self-possessed as ever. She announced that the duke commanded the instant presence of his daughter.</p>
                  <p>Margarita found her father in his audience chamber. He motioned her to a seat, and addressed her in a cold and determined tone.</p>
                  <p>"Margarita," said he, "we have reached a crisis in the affairs of our state. Whatever we do must be done briefly. This morning you wed Montaldo."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, father," said the princess, faintly.</p>
                  <p>"I could have wished," said the duke, "for a brilliant scene at your espousals; but fate has ordered otherwise. In our private chapel the altar is already decorated—a priest is in waiting to perform the nuptial ceremony. I have summoned Montaldo from the wall to receive your hand at mine."</p>
                  <p>"Father," faltered Margarita, "this precipitation—"</p>
                  <p>"The affair admits of no discussion or delay. You have heard my will. No maiden scruples."</p>
                  <p>"I cannot wed Montaldo."</p>
                  <p>"Not to-day!"</p>
                  <p>"Never!"</p>
                  <p>"How is this?" cried the duke, the flush or rising passion coloring his pallid check.</p>
                  <p>"For the best of reasons, I cannot wed him," answered Margarita firmly.</p>
                  <p>"Name it."</p>
                  <p>"I love another."</p>
                  <p>"Another! And his name?"</p>
                  <p>"That is my secret, father."</p>
                  <p>"I shall know how to extort it."</p>
                  <p>"And Montaldo, father, he too loves another.</p>
                  <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7296-00000030"/>
                  <p>But why should I seek to evade the truth? Delays, prevarications, mysteries are indeed of no avail. He I love is the Prince Giulio."</p>
                  <p>"He can never be yours," said the duke, shuddering as he spoke.</p>
                  <p>"And why not, father? Why should not our fend be healed by my union with the rightful heir of Parma?"</p>
                  <p>"Death has already forbidden the banns."</p>
                  <p>"Death!" exclaimed the princess, with wellfeigned horror.</p>
                  <p>"I cannot conceal it from you longer, Margarita," said the duke, placing his kerchief to his eyes, "but last night your cousin died in his prison house."</p>
                  <p>"Giulio dead?"</p>
                  <p>"This morning his body was delivered to the Duke of Milan."</p>
                  <p>"Alas! alas!" cried the princess, wringing her hands.</p>
                  <p>"Thus should end my cares and troubles," said the duke. "But," he added, gnashing his teeth, "Milan accuses me of foul play, and yet threatens to storm the city. Montaldo is, I fear me, wavering; and there is no other to whom I can entrust the command of the troops. Your hand would secure him."</p>
                  <p>"This morning," said the princess, "he avowed to me his love for Estella."</p>
                  <p>"Then Estella must no longer be an obstacle," muttered the duke.</p>
                  <p>"What have I said?" exclaimed the princess. "Father, you cannot mean harm to that young girl."</p>
                  <p>The reply of the duke was prevented by the entrance of a messenger, who announced an ambassador from the Duke of Milan.</p>
                  <p>"Admit him instantly," said the duke.</p>
                  <p>And then he summoned his attendants as witnesses, and the presence-chamber was soon filled with a numerous retinue.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE MESSAGE OF MILAN.</head>
                  <p>WHEN all were assembled and ranged in the order befitting the reception of an ambassador, the draperies were withdrawn from the great door at the lower end of the hall, opposite the ducal throne, and preceded by the flourishing of trumpets, there entered a knight armed from head to heel in a brilliant suit. A cloud of snowy plumage tossed and danced upon his crest, he held a truncheon in his mailed grasp, and the rowels of his golden spurs rang on the marble pavement as he moved slowly, pausing every few seconds, up the hall. As his helmet was closed, much curiosity was felt by the courtiers as to his identity, a curiosity heightened by the straining gaze which the duke himself fixed upon the approaching figure. In fact, it was noticed that the countenance of the duke was ashen pale, and that he was singularly agitated.</p>
                  <p>In the same strange manner—three steps and then a halt—the figure continued to advance, until the duke, by stretching out his hand, could have touched the truncheon of the messenger, when the stranger suddenly sank down in a heap at the foot of the throne.</p>
                  <p>"Most mighty prince," said an indistinct voice from the interior of the helmet, "bid and armorer or any one who hath sufficient skill, to undo my helmet and give me air, and relieve me from a portion of this weight of steel and iron."</p>
                  <p>At a sign from the duke, several helping hands accomplished the wish of the stranger, who was relieved of his helmet and placed upon his feet. With profound astonishment, the duke, who had recognized the armor, now beheld the features of Tonio, the jester.</p>
                  <p>"Answer me truly, thou knave," said the duke, sternly, "how camest thou by that armor?"</p>
                  <p>"Marry, your exemplary mightiness, I dreamed myself into it," replied the jester.</p>
                  <p>"How, sirrah?"</p>
                  <p>"Will your tremendous transparency permit me to explain?" said the jester. "Yesternight, if your august eminence remembers, your magnanimous elemency consigned the gentleman who now addresses you to the care of a very unpleasant individual, who has the honor of officiating as your head jailer."</p>
                  <p>"Go on, sirrah! but I warn you to be brief," said the duke.</p>
                  <p>"Mighty potentate, I will be brief," and he gabbled on as fast as his tongue could move; "breakfast with the jailer—chicken, wine, sleepy, sound nap, wake up in a coffin dressed in armor in the camp of the Milanses. Duke of Milan wanted to hang me because somebody had cheated somebody, somehow or other; that's all, your highness."</p>
                  <p>"And you came back, like a fool, into the lion's den," said the duke, the angry flush loccasioned by the narrative, yet burning on his check.</p>
                  <p>"Pardon me, your gracious grace," said the jester, "though no one can admire more than I do the eminent individual whom I have the honor to address, still it seems to my poor judgement, that your tremendous majesty is best admired at a distance. Vesuvius is a very beautiful spectacle seen from afar during an cruption, but the wise man was no better than a fool who watched it from the brink of the crater and was burned alive for his pains."</p>
                  <p>"Then tell me, in the fiend's name, how came you here?" said the duke, losing all patience.</p>
                  <p>"I came, your grace, because I couldn't help it," answered the poor jester. "His tremendous highness of Milan is just as imperious as your extraordinary majesty. I was between two fires. My own wish said stay; his grace of Milan said 'go,' and his grace's orders were more powerful than my wishes. Yet, to do him justice, and to correct the unfavorable impression I have rather hastily given of him, I ought to remark that nothing could possibly be handsomer than the delicate manner in which he insinulated his views. 'Tonio,' said he, 'I wish you to bear a message to Parma, but you can decline the mission if you dislike the honor, only, if you don't go, I shall hang you.' Of course, under the circumstances, I accepted."</p>
                  <p>"The message! the message!" said the duke, stamping his foot impatiently.</p>
                  <p>"Your grace will hold me harmless for the words I am compelled to utter," said the jester, trembling violently.</p>
                  <p>"I have not heard them yet," said the duke, evasively. "But if you do not instantly deliver the message, without suppressing a single word, in ten minutes your worthless carcase shall waver in the wind from our highest battlement."</p>
                  <p>With death thus staring him directly in the face, the jester no longer hesitated. Laying aside the bombastic and burlesque manner which had become, from long use, natural to him, he spoke as follows:</p>
                  <p>"His grace of Milan sends greeting to the Duke of Parma. The Duke of Parma, through an authorized agent, pledged himself this morning to surrender the person of Giulio Veroni, rightful heir to the throne of Parma, to his kinsman. Instead thereof, at the appointed time, the aforesaid agent, being an officer of rank in the household of the Duke of Parma, came with the intelligence that Giulio had died in prison, and in place of the living Giulio, gave up a coffin said to contain his remains, but which, on being opened, was found to contain a living man, the jester of the prince. This outrage on all decency—this deception—the added trickery and insult, should have put an end to all forbearance. It is not out of regard to the Duke of Parma that his grace of Milan holds back for a moment that vengeance due to conduct like this; but in somuch as he is willing to spare the effusion of innocent blood, he now declares that if, within one half hour from the reception of this message, Giulio Veroni, living and unharmed, shall be set at liberty and sent under an honorable escort to the court of Milan, then the Duke of Milan will be ready to agree upon an armistice and a conference to adjust the claims of Giulio. But if the said Giulio shall not be so liberated and given up, then the order to assault the city shall be immediately given; no quarter will be shown the garrison when the city is taken, and Parma shall be given up to sack and pillage."</p>
                  <p>High swelled the wrath of the Duke of Parma. The princess sought to interpose a word, but her father commanded her to be silent, and rising, while his whole frame shook with passion, he dictated this reply to the messenger of Milan.</p>
                  <p>"Tell your master that the prince shall never be surrendered; that I spurn his proposition and dare him to the assault. But say to him that the sister of the princess is also in my power, and that the moment his columns move to the assault, her body shall be flung from the ramparts and dashed to atoms at their base. Hence with all speed, and deliver this my message."</p>
                  <p>"If you harm a hair of the signora's head," said the jester, who was passionately devoted to her, "your life shall pay the forfeit."</p>
                  <p>"Away, vassal!" cried the duke, "and do thine errand."</p>
                  <p>The jester did not wait a second bidding, but retired from the hall, forgetting, in his indignation, the ceremonial etiquette of backing out of the august presence. A dead silence followed his departure, during which an uneasy feeling reigned. The throats of the Duke of Milan were more dreaded at the moment than the anger of the ruler of Parma. The latter, after his passion had subsided, also became a prey to vague fears of the result. Yet he concealed his agitation, as well as he might, from the prying eyes of his courtiers. Beckoning the page to him, he whispered an order. A sinister smile wreathed the lips of Zelie, as, glancing malignantly at the princess, she retired to obey the order. After a very few minutes of painful and breathless suspense<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7296-00000031"/> pense, Zelie reappeared, conducting the Lady Estella.</p>
                  <p>The duke beckoned an officer of the guard towards him.</p>
                  <p>"Take this lady," he said, "to the ramparts where Ferrado holds watch and ward. Deliver her into his hands, and tell him to treat her for the present with all courtesy and respect; but, should Milan dare to loose an arrow flight against the walls, or advance a column to the assault, tell him to fling her from the battlements at the foot of the advancing enemy. He has been warned of the consequences; he shall see that we can keep our word."</p>
                  <p>Such savage commands and deeds were then not unusual in warfare, and the soldier accordingly accepted his mission as readily as an officer of our day would undertake to repel an advance by a battery. But while Estella clasped her hands in speechless agony, the princess rushed forward and threw herself at her father's feet, and clasped his knees.</p>
                  <p>"Father," said she, "you will not do this wrong; you will not make a guileless girl the victim of your hate and fear. I conjure you to remember your honor in this crisis."</p>
                  <p>"Rise, girl," said the prince, with a frown. "Respect your own rank, if you have no respect for mine. Think you the Duke of Milan will spare age or sex should his ruffians carry the defences and enter the city. Neither will I spare any attempt to check him. Your prayers are in vain. Retire to your apartment, and leave affair's of state to those who understand them."</p>
                  <p>"Father, a word from me might arrest the threatened danger. Were the Prince Giulio here—"</p>
                  <p>"He should die the death of a traitor by the quick edge of the axe," said the duke, furiously enunciating his threat. "You shall see how I will deal with him."</p>
                  <p>The princes rose to her feet and shrunk with horror from the side of her evil parent. Folding Estella in her arms, she whispered:</p>
                  <p>"Fear nothing. Montaldo is a noble nature. He will not harm you for worlds. Blinded by passion, the duke forgets to whom he is committing you."</p>
                  <p>Estella warmly returned the embrace of her friend, and committed herself to the kind care of Providence, and while she was being led away by her attendants, the princess retired to her apartments to meditate upon the best course to be pursued in the existing circumstances.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
                  <head type="sub">FERRADO AND ESTELLA.</head>
                  <p>ESTELLA, Conducted by the officer to whose charge she had been committed, now followed his guidance down the winding stairs of the palace out into the court-yard. Here, in a few moments, a hand-litter was prepared for her, into which she was courteously handed. A few guards then surrounded the conveyance, and the little procession set forward. Arrived at the foot of the walls, the litter halted and she was assisted to alight, and the duke's officer led her through a narrow doorway and up a staircase constructed in the thickness of the wall, from the top of which they emerged upon the broad ranmpart. Montaldo, apprised of an order from the duke, advanced to receive the messenger.</p>
                  <p>"I am ordered to commit to your safe keeping, signor commandant," said the officer, speaking in a low tone, "the person of this lady—the sister of the Prince Giulio. The duke commands you to treat her with all courtesy; but, the moment a demonstration is made against the city, to fling her from the battlements at the feet of the invader."</p>
                  <p>Ferrado had great difficulty to command his emotions, so as to frame a suitable reply. At last he said:</p>
                  <p>"I thank my noble master for the confidence he reposes in me. Go back to the duke, and tell him that Ferrado Montaldo will comport himself like a soldier and a gentleman of honor."</p>
                  <p>The officer bowed low and retired. Estella and Montaldo stood alone upon the rampart.</p>
                  <p>"Lady," said Ferrado, "I little thought we should meet so soon again, and in this—of all places."</p>
                  <p>"And under such circumstances," said Estella.</p>
                  <p>"You are aware of the orders I have received from the duke?" said Montaldo, coldly.</p>
                  <p>"He was so cruel as to give them in my hearing," replied Estella, shuddering.</p>
                  <p>"As a soldier, holding a high commission from the duke, with all the consideration and emoluments appertaining to the rank," said Ferrado, "I have no choice but blind obedience to his commands. As such, were he to command me to slay my own father I should be compelled to obey him. Such is milatary loyalty in a despotic state."</p>
                  <p>"But the princess told me that I could confide in you," said Estella, shuddering at the cold, inflexible flexible tone of the commander; "that you would not betray me."</p>
                  <p>"Can I betray my prince?"</p>
                  <p>Estella was silent.</p>
                  <p>"Come hither, maiden," said Montaldo. "Give me thy hand. Nay, shrink not—the hour of sacrifice has not yet arrived. Now come with me."</p>
                  <p>Estella placed her trembling hand in the mailed glove of her late lover—now her executioner, and submitted to his guidance. He led her to the edge of the wall, and holding her hand firmly, bade her look downward. The wall rose perpendicularly fifty feet from the edge of the moat, at the brink of which lay a pile of jagged rocks.</p>
                  <p>"Light as your person is," said Montaldo, "do you not think it would fall heavily upon those cruel rocks?"</p>
                  <p>"It is death to think of it," said the shuddering girl.</p>
                  <p>"Come away then, quickly," said Montaldo.</p>
                  <p>"There is a strange, wild fascination in gazing from these dizzy, unfenced heights. The tempter is close at hand at such times, whispering in the ear of mortals, as reason reels upon her throne, that it is glorious to plunge into the abyss. Methinks it were the best ending of our trials, clasped in a fond embrace to spring into the yawning gulf."</p>
                  <p>"Come away, Montaldo!" said Estella, shuddering at the wild fancy of her companion.</p>
                  <p>They had been seen by the army of Milan, which had advanced close to the walls, and the duke had recognized the white dress of the lady. A fierce shout of angry menance rose from the ranks.</p>
                  <p>"We are observed," said Montaldo, calmly. "Let us retire behind this turret."</p>
                  <p>When they were screened from the observation of the enemy, the feelings which Montaldo had struggled to repress, burst forth. He seized the hands of Estella, pressed them convulsively to his lips, and covered them with kisses.</p>
                  <p>"Did you think for a moment, dearest," he exclaimed, "that I could harm a hair of your head? Did you think that I could behold those delicate limbs dashed to atoms on the ruthless rocks—that I could murder my own love, and slay my own heart? Estella! Estella! my own love—you are safe and free. We must part—but remember that your Ferrado loves you better than life and liberty—and that he surrendered both to secure them both to you."</p>
                  <p>"What means you, Ferrado?" asked the lady, as she caressed his steel gauntlet with her dainty fingers.</p>
                  <p>"No matter—question me not. Your life—my honor are safe. But time presses; the duke may find other hirelings less scrupulous than myself. Bide here but a moment, and I will rejoin you."</p>
                  <p>Estella was indeed left alone but a very few moments. Ferrado soon rejoined her, and conducted her to the foot of the wall, where a saddle-horse awaited her, upon which he seated her tenderly and carefully. Then, mounting his own horse at her side, and accompanied by a trumpeter and half a dozen cavaliers, he led the way to the gate already open, across the sounding draw-bridge, and directly towards the enemy's lines. The presence of a lady of course showed the pacific character of the party, and as they advanced, the Duke of Milan himself rode forth to meet them. Ferrado saluted the duke, and his salutation was answered by cold courtesy.</p>
                  <p>"My lord," said Ferrado, "I surrender to your grace's charge, the Lady Estella, sister of Prince Giulio."</p>
                  <p>"Ha! this is well!" said the duke. "Parma is coming to his senses. I thought he dared not execute his meanaces. But Prince Giulio?"</p>
                  <p>"I have nothing further to communicate," said Ferrado, coldly.</p>
                  <p>"Then prepare for the assault," said the duke.</p>
                  <p>"We are ready to meet it," firmly answered Ferrado.</p>
                  <p>Dismounting from his charger, he lifted Estella from her saddle, and breathed in her car a passionate farewell. Springing on his horse again and saluting the duke, he wheeled his charger, and with his party rode back into the city. Dismissing his men to their several posts, he then dashed his rowels into his horse's flanks and rode furiously to the ducal palace, where, flinging his rein to a groom and bounding to the ground, he pushed through the astonished guards and attendants, and rushed into the presence of the duke.</p>
                  <p>"What news, Ferrado?" asked the duke, startled by his sudden appearance.</p>
                  <p>"Nothing new has chanced—but the Duke of Milan has ordered the assault."</p>
                  <p>"Ha! you know then the first step of revenge. The lady Estella is in your hands."</p>
                  <p>"You are mistaken," said Montaldo, frowning.</p>
                  <p>"How!" cried the duke, alarmed, "where is she?"</p>
                  <pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7296-00000032"/>
                  <p>"In the camp of Milan—safe from harm, thank Heaven!"</p>
                  <p>"You mean not what you say," cried the duke, springing to his feet.</p>
                  <p>"This moment I surrendered her to the safe keeping of the Duke of Milan. And now, Duke of Parma, hear me. I am no longer soldier of yours. Take back the commission you bestowed on me—I will not have it. This sword I thought would carve out honor for me—there it lies!" and he flung the weapon at the feet of the duke. "Here are the spurs of knighthood you bestowed on me." He tore them from his heels and spurned them from him. "There is my casque," he said, flinging down his plumed helmet on the floor. "Now do with me what you will. Chains—death—are better than your service."</p>
                  <p>"Traitor!" cried the duke.</p>
                  <p>"Thou art the traitor!" retorted Ferrado. "Traitor to the laws of honor—traitor to the laws of blood. To preserve your miserable life and wretched state, you would shed the same blood that flows in your own veins, diluted, turned to venom though it be, in the transmission."</p>
                  <p>"I will hear no more," cried the duke. "Guards! advance and seize the prisoner."</p>
                  <p>"I thank your grace," said Ferrado. "This—this is truly honor. Disgrace and imprisonment at this court are proofs of honesty and merit. But look well to the walls, my liege—send some one to supply my place—time presses. As gallant a leader and as brave an army as ever rushed to the assault of citadel, are at this moment sweeping forward. Their cry is 'Giulio or vengeance!"</p>
                  <p>"You shall not live to witness their triumph."</p>
                  <p>"I care not for life. It is enough that I know you cannot escape punishment."</p>
                  <p>With these words of defiance on his lips, Ferrado, in the grasp of the guards, was dragged away to the prison.</p>

               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE DUKE OF PARMA ON THE ALERT.</head>
                  <p>TO replace Ferrado, the duke detailed another officer of rank, by name Antonio Ferretti, who was ordered to take charge of the troops, and to answer for their holding out to the last at the peril of his head. This duty performed, the duke dismissed his court, reserving a small, personal guard. Having given some instructions to these men, he led them by a passage formerly spoken of, to the vicinity of the astrologer's apartment, where they were silently halted, while he alone entered.</p>
                  <p>The astrologer rose calmly to receive his illustrious visitor. The duke, on the other hand, assumed a cheerful, confident air, which was far from representing the poignant anxiety and the racking doubts of his guilty heart.</p>
                  <p>When they were both seated, for Magnus, had permission to seat himself in the ducal presence, his grace opened the conversation.</p>
                  <p>"Well, Magnus, hast thou merited my bounty by scanning the aspect of my fortunmes lately—and how do they appear to you?"</p>
                  <p>"Bright—radiant—glorious—my lord," replied the astrologer.</p>
                  <p>"No clouds to obscure them?" asked the duke, carelessly.</p>
                  <p>"Specs, flaws, but no clouds," replied the astrologer, in a tone of confidence.</p>
                  <p>"That is well," said the duke, smiling. "I have to thank you for the speedy effect of your potion on Giulio. He is dead."</p>
                  <p>"No need to inform me of aught, my lord, save for the sake of comment," said the astrologer, "for in my magic mirror I read all that has passed, all that passes, and all that will come to past."</p>
                  <p>As he spoke, he carelessly touched a small hand-mirror that lay upon his table.</p>
                  <p>"May I not took upon it?" asked the duke.</p>
                  <p>"Surely," replied the astrologer. "Yet to your unlearned eye, it will only give back the image of your own countenance, Second sight is an especial gift of Heaven."</p>
                  <p>"Well then, venerable sage, cast thine eyes upon the wonderful plate, and tell me what thou seest therein. I would know the position of Ferrado Montaldo at this moment."</p>
                  <p>The astrologer gazed intently on the mirror.</p>
                  <p>"There are clouds here," he muttered. "Now they open like drapery folded back from a picture. I see a line of wall, a proud banner displayed, a warrior on the rampart marshalling his troops—I recognize the face, it is Ferrado Montaldo. He is at his post, your grace."</p>
                  <p>"It is well," said the duke, smothering his rising passion. "Now look again, and tell me where is the Lady Estella."</p>
                  <p>"I see," said the astrologer, consulting his mirror again, "I see the interior of the princess's apartment. Estella is seated there beside her."</p>
                  <p>"Wonderful magician!" cried the duke.</p>
                  <p>"Methinks, inspired by your presence, I too am gifted with this wonderful vision and with a prophetic spirit. Give me the mirror!" He took it in his hand and gazed on its polished surface intently. Then starting back: "What do I behold? Another holds the place of Ferrado on the outer wall: I see Montaldo in a dungeon—the Lady Estella free!"</p>
                  <p>"My lord," said the astrologer, with a trembling voice, "the evil spirits are deceiving thee."</p>
                  <p>"The evil spirit that has deceived me is before me!" exclaimed the duke, springing to his feet, and dashing the mirror to atoms on the floor.</p>
                  <p>"Lo! as I crush these atoms under foot, so do I spurn thy trickeries, thou false, unblushing knave. Too long have you ruled my spirit unquestioned and undoubted. You promised me good fortune, and the dark hour is upon me. You counselled me to evil, and pretended to aid me, yet all the schemes I have undertaken at your bidding have failed—and I have become poor, while my wealth has flowed into your coffers. I have now detected you, and you shall pay the penalty of your long imposture. Soldiers! arrest this man."</p>
                  <p>At the duke's call, the guard without rushed in and advanced upon the charlatan.</p>
                  <p>"Back, knaves!" said the astrologer, rising to his loftiest height, and extending his arm. "Touch me at your peril. At a word of mine, an earthquake would shake this tower to its foundations, and bury you all in its ruins. For me, I am invulnerable. The mortal hand that seeks to grasp me will be palsied, and mortal weapons are powerless against my charmed life."</p>
                  <p>The cunning astrologer reckoned on the superstitious character of the persons be addressed. They had advanced without hesitation at the bidding of their master, but they now shrank back, as if a blighting spell were upon them, and whispered moodily among themselves.</p>
                  <p>"Am I to be obeyed, or not?" cried the duke, stamping his feet.</p>
                  <p>"Against mortal foe we would not hesitate," said one of the men, a German, crossing himself. "But we cannot war against fiends in human shape."</p>
                  <p>"Fools! cowards!" cried the duke, foaming with passion. "I will show you that he is mortal like yourselves."</p>
                  <p>And with these words he unsheathed his sword, but as he levelled its point at the breast of the astrologer, and drew back his arm to give full force to his meditated stroke, a figure rushed swiftly between him and his intended victim. It was the astrologer's daughter.</p>
                  <p>"Selim!" cried the duke, for she still wore her page's dress—"what mean you?"</p>
                  <p>"To protect my father's life, even at the hazard of my own. Fear nothing, dear father. Even the Duke of Parma dare not strike thee through a woman's heart."</p>
                  <p>"A woman!" said the duke, lowering his weapon. After a moment's pause, he added: "You are both my prisoners. Are you armed?"</p>
                  <p>Zelie contemptuously tossed a poignard at the feet of the duke.</p>
                  <p>"Had I arrived too late," she said, "I would have buried that weapon to the hilt in your false heart."</p>
                  <p>The duke shuddered as he looked back at the danger from which he had escaped.</p>
                  <p>"Guard the prisoners!" were his orders to the soldiers, who no longer hesitated to close round them, "and follow me."</p>
                  <p>He then led the way down the staircase and into the prison, Zelie clinging convulsively to the arm of her father, whose head was bowed upon his breast in the most object dejection.</p>
                  <p>At the entrance of the prison, Matteo, the jailer, lay coiled up like a huge snake on his bench, but sprange to his feet at the duke's summons, and admitted the train.</p>
                  <p>"More traitors for your safe keeping, faithful Matteo," said the duke, with an affiable smile.</p>
                  <p>The brutal jailer grinned, as he surveyed the persons designated. "A detected charlatan and his daughter," said the duke.</p>
                  <p>"I have but one favor to solicit," said the astrologer. "Let us be confined in one cell."</p>
                  <p>"So be it," said the duke. "Lead on, Matteo."</p>
                  <p>The jailer led the way to a cell into which Magnus and his daughter were thrust, and the door locked upon them.</p>
                  <p>"Now," said the duke, "answer me one question, and fear not to reply. Where is Prince Giulio?"</p>
                  <p>"My lord, he has escaped."</p>
                  <p>"And you did not inform me of it!"</p>
                  <p>"My lord!" cried the jailer, falling on his knees, "he was set at liberty by your grace's daughter. How could I refuse obedience to her commands, when you have ever told me that she bore equal sway with yourself, and when she showed your grace's signet-ring?"</p>
                  <p>"Rise, my good follow, rise!" said the duke.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps it is as well that the prince is free.</p>
                  <p>We will waste no more words upon the matter.<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7296-00000033"/> But, my good Matteo, I have another prisoner for you. This villain was a man I trusted, and he betrayed my confidence. I am determined to make a signal example of him; and I would hold him securely till the hour of execution comes."</p>
                  <p>"Another execution!" said the jailer, rubbing his hands exultingly, "and will your grace permit me to act as executioner?"</p>
                  <p>"That can hardly be, my friend," said the duke, smiling. "I have arranged that office for another."</p>
                  <p>"As your grace pleases," said the jailer, with a change of countenance.</p>
                  <p>"Now, my good fellow—though I have no fear that you will suffer another prisoner to escape, for I have revoked all the authority ever committed to my daughter, still I wish to know that this wretch is confined in the very strongest dungeon."</p>
                  <p>"I will show your grace one that is secure as the grave," answered the jailer, "if you will follow me."</p>
                  <p>The duke motioned him to proceed, and still attended by his guard, advanced along the corridor, till the guide halted at a massive door, and unlocked and opened it. The duke looking in saw a narrow cell with a single barred window.</p>
                  <p>"Are you sure those bars are strong—that they are not rusted?"</p>
                  <p>"Ay, my lord, I have examined them but lately."</p>
                  <p>"Let me see you try their strength again," said the duke. "Leave your keys with me."</p>
                  <p>The jailer handed him the keys, while he went into the cell to show the duke how solid were the bars. When he had reached the farther part of the dungeon, the duke closed the door upon him and locked it.</p>
                  <p>"One traitor is secured," he said, exultingly.</p>
                  <p>Then he handed the keys to one of the soldiers, the same man who had spoken for his comrades in the astrologer's apartment.</p>
                  <p>"Carlo," said he, "I make you jailer in place of that false villain, with princely pay, if you serve me well—instant death, if you falter in your task. My eye will be upon you. Admit no one to the prisoners except on an order from my lips. They are all conspiring against me," he muttered to himself," but my courage rises with the emergency. The ducal coronet is a prize worth fighting for—if I lose that, I lose all."</p>
                  <p>And followed by his guards, he returned to the palace.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE STORM OF THE CITY.—FINAL EVENTS.</head>
                  <p>WE will now return to the camp of the Duke of Milan, who, it will be remembered, received the Lady Estella from the hands of Ferrado Montaldo. She was conducted to a tent hastily vacated and prepared for her reception, where the duke courteously bade her to repose until such time as she felt inclined to ride to Milan, as he said a rude camp was no place for even a day's sojourn of a delicate lady.</p>
                  <p>"Pardon me, my lord, the presence of these gallant men, all so full of courage and animated in a good cause—friends of my brother and myself, revives and animates my spirits. I love to hear the neighing of steeds, to see the lance-heads and cuirasses fling back the sunbeams—yes, even to mark that brazen-throated artillery, when I know the purpose of this warlike preparation. With your leave, good my lord, I will remain here, nearer to Montaldo and to Giulio."</p>
                  <p>"To Montaldo!" said the duke, meaningly, and fixing his keen eyes upon her. "Why to Montaldo? I distrust that man. I deem him a party to the juggle put upon me in the matter of the pretended surrender of your brother."</p>
                  <p>The color mounted to the cheek of Estella, and her eye sparkled.</p>
                  <p>"You wrong him, my lord—you wrong him," she said. "Ferrado Montaldo is one of the noblest of men. He never knowingly deceived you. He was never a party to the schemes of that bad man, who, for our misfortune, is our relative."</p>
                  <p>And she hastened to relate all she knew to the advantage of Montaldo, not forgetting to enlarge upon his last generous act.</p>
                  <p>"Nay, I take back all I have said against him, fair cousin," said the Duke of Milan. "And if I meet him in the fray, for your sake, I will turn aside my weapon and seek some more ignoble foe—though I had promised myself to cross swords with Ferrado. But how fares it with your brother?"</p>
                  <p>"He is now within the city—although last night at liberty," answered Estella.</p>
                  <p>"At liberty! and came not to me, his kinsman!"</p>
                  <p>Estella told him all she knew respecting the motives of her brother's return.</p>
                  <p>"By heavens!" said the duke, "love is, after all, a temporary insanity. Instead of coming to me and entering the city in triumph with a brilliant liant army, he flies back, alone and unprotected—back into the wolf's den, because his heart is with his ladye-love and he fears a rival. Out on it! But no time is to be lost. The hour for action has arrived. If you will not accept an escort to Milan, fair cousin, at least you will withdraw to some distance from the scene of coming strife."</p>
                  <p>"No," said Estella, "I am a soldier's daughter, and with my happiness staked upon the issue of this conflict, I must be a witness of the fortunes of the day."</p>
                  <p>"And I will have a horse saddled for you,"said the duke, "so that, should the tide set against us, or a sortie from the city sweep the plain, your flight will be secure. And now, dear Estella, farewell; I go to do my devoir."</p>
                  <p>"May Heaven protect and give you victory, my noble kinsman!" said Estella, pressing his hand to her heart.</p>
                  <p>"Amen!" said the duke, and he passed out of the tent.</p>
                  <p>In another moment, the faithful Tonio was at the feet of his adored mistress, kissing the hem of her garment passionately, and making frantic demonstrations of delight.</p>
                  <p>"Rise, dear Tonio," said Estella. "I do not like to see you at my feet."</p>
                  <p>The jester rose with some reluctance.</p>
                  <p>"You will see the most gallant knights of Italy there, fair mistress," said he, "ere long—when you have got your rights and your uncle his dues. Don't you think there's some mistake about his being your uncle?"</p>
                  <p>Estella shook her head.</p>
                  <p>"May we not suppose," said the jester, "that your real uncle in his infancy was stolen by gipsies and a beggar's brat slipped into the cradle in his place—you know all babies look alike? And may we not hope that just as our friend in Parma is elevated to a yet higher position than he occupies by a strand of hemp rove through a block, that the real and true uncle will turn up, properly marked for accidental recognition, so as to make things square and comfortable all round?"</p>
                  <p>"Such things occur in the lays of troubadours and the fables of the minnesingers," said the princess, smiling, "but not in actual life. But, Tonio, why are you here in attendance on a lady, when you should be in arms, marching on the foe?"</p>
                  <p>"I am obeying orders," said the jester. "His grace of Milan believed that my valor was so pre-eminent that it would put him to shame. Jealousy, you see, my lady—but I say nothing further—for he is a very gentleman."</p>
                  <p>"But if I intereede with him—"</p>
                  <p>"Not for worlds, dear lady. To tell you the truth, I never was cut out for a soldier. My business is cracking jests not cracking heads—and I have too much brains to expose them to be knocked out. I assure you the hours I passed recently with an iron pot on my head, and an iron jacket on my back, were the most uncomfortable of my life. No, no, my lady, my post is beside your dear self. For you I could fight to the death—but in a general melee my arm were nothing worth. But hark! there go the trumpets! Look out for yourself, old ogre of Parma—I beg your pardon—I forgot, my lady, that you had the honor of being the old ruffian's niece."</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile the duke had been marshalling his forces, and preparing to open his fire on the city. He advanced boldly close up to the walls, taking advantage of inequalities of ground to shelter his men from the shot of the rampart guns, while he protected the others, his light troops, from the archery of the Parmese crossbowmen by pushing forward huge, movable screens, rolling on wheels. When all his guns, and the artillery of those days, being in its infancy, was clumsy and inefficient compared to ours, were placed in battery, the trumpets sounded a defiant signal, and a furious fire was opened all along the line. This was answered from the walls of the city, but while the Milanese guns, skilfully pointed, tore at once open the crumbling ramparts of the city, those of the enemy, badly served, responded almost harmlessly. The efforts of the duke were directed chiefly against the principal entrance of the town. He had observed that the chains which held the portcullis, were apparently weak and badly rusted, and on these a storm of shot was poured incessantly. At last one of them was broken, and as the severed links fell rattling down, a shout of triumph rose from the assaulting forces. The ponderous drawbridge, sustained now by only one chain, bent heavily by its own weight, vibrated and swung to the detonation of the artillery. The roar of the guns was now deafening, the assailants and defenders both increasing their fire. High above the wrathful roar of battle were heard the clear, trumpet-tones of the Duke of Milan, encouraging his troops.</p>
                  <p>"Well done, my merry men all. Ply them hotly! One round more and the bridge falls!"</p>
                  <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC7296-00000034"/>
                  <p>Encouraged by the presence and the words of their leader, the gunners toiled at their engines of destruction with redoubled ardor. In a few moments the second chain was severed and the ponderous bridge came thundering down amidst triumphant shouts of exultation. But the victory was not yet achieved. The huge oak gates of the city, studded and clamped with iron, were yet to be beaten down. Ere he could issue his orders, the imperuous troops had poured upon the drawbridge, and were shot down, almost to a man, by the deadly aim of the archers of Parma.</p>
                  <p>"Back! back!" shouted the duke, above the storm of battle. "To your guns again!"</p>
                  <p>The fragment of the gallant band that had advanced so rashly, fell back and divided to the right and left, while a whole park of artillery, dragged forward to the head of the bridge, poured over it a deluge of fire. The gate yielded at last.</p>
                  <p>"Now them!" shouted the duke. "Forward with your axes."</p>
                  <p>A rush was made against the shattered remnants of the gate, and it came down by the fury of the assault.</p>
                  <p>"Room there!" shouted the duke, "and then close in and follow me!"</p>
                  <p>Spurring his wild war-horse over the bridge, the gallant duke was the first to enter the city, while rank after rank of his plumed host followed him like crested billows dashing into a cave. The defenders of the city fell back in dismay and disasrray.</p>
                  <p>"Down with your arms!" shouted the duke, "we thirst for no man's life. Victory and not bloodshed is what we strive for."</p>
                  <p>Nearly all the soldiers of Parma embraced the offered mercy and threw down their arms. A few faithful mercenaries, chiefly German and Swiss, still held out, but they were overpowered by numbers and cut down unsparingly. Onward swept the wave of victory. The din of contending arms almost ceased, and nothing was heard but the clattering of horses' hoofs and the exultant shouts of the victors. Sweeping past the palace, the duke rode straight to the prison, for he thought it best to protect the victims of the tyrant of Parma, lest in desperation at his downfall he avenged himself on these defenceless men.</p>
                  <p>Carlo, the new jailer, sullenly yielded up the keys to the duke as he dismounted from his horse at the outer gate of the prison, seeing that resistance was no longer possible.</p>
                  <p>"Tell where the Prince Giulio lies," said the duke.</p>
                  <p>"He is not in my custody," said the jailer.</p>
                  <p>"If you utter a single falsehood," said the duke, "you die the death."</p>
                  <p>"I have no motive in deceiving you," said the man. "I know that you are master now."</p>
                  <p>The duke turned back in disappointment.</p>
                  <p>"What prisoners were particularly committed to your charge?"</p>
                  <p>"This morning, an old man—the duke's astrologer—and his boy."</p>
                  <p>"The astrologer!" exclaimed the Duke of Milan. "The very man to give me all the information that I seek. Conduct me to his cell."</p>
                  <p>The jailer led the way, and pointed out the apartment. The duke unlocked the door hastily and entered. Near the door two figures were lying on a rude bench, in a sleeping posture. Magnus, the astrologer, was reclining in an easy attitude against the wall, while one arm encircled his daughter, whose head was resting on his breast. The duke laid his hand on the shoulder of the astrologer, but, gazing in the faces of the supposed sleepers, started back in horror. They were both dead. A broken phial at the feet of the old man would have told the story, though more explicit evidence of the manner of their death was not wanting. A small roll of parchment had fallen beside the phial. The duke picked it up and read as follows:</p>
                  <q>
                     <floatingText>
                        <body>

                              <p>"We die by our own hands—father and daughter. He could not survive disgrace, penury and detection; I who pen these lines, could not live to see the prince wedded to another. Whoever thou art who readest this scroll, bear to Prince Giulio my last words; tell him that I died repentant—that I prayed my poor services to him might offset my treachery and misconduct. I belied the Princess Margarita—she alone is worthy of his love. The prince could never have been mine, for he is a Christian, and I die a true believer in the Prophet. Farewell!</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>"There is a mystery in this," said the duke, as he placed the scroll in his breast, "which the princess must explain to me. See that these bodies are not disturbed, jailer."</p>
                  <p>He left the prison, and, accompanied by a numerous train, went directly to the audience chamber of the Duke of Parma. The duke, ashen pale, deserted by his courtiers, was seated on his throne.</p>
                  <p>"Duke of Milan," he said, rising, "I am now wholly in your power."</p>
                  <p>"Justice shall be done you, never fear," said the Duke of Milan, sternly.</p>
                  <p>At this moment the Princess Magarita rushed forward, and threw herself at the feet of the victor.</p>
                  <p>"Noble duke," said she, "he as generous as you are great. For my sake—for the sake of one who has never injured you, spare my father!"</p>
                  <p>"Upon one condition," said the Duke of Milan, raising her—"that he produce Prince Giulio alive and unharmed."</p>
                  <p>"That condition is my death sentence," said the usurper.</p>
                  <p>The princess retired for one moment, and reappeared, leading Giulio by the hand. The prince rushed into the arms of his victorious kinsman.</p>
                  <p>"Generous, noble friend," said he, "I owe victory to you, as I do life and liberty to this peerless lady."</p>
                  <p>"You have saved your father's life," said the Duke of Milan, addressing Margarita. "Had a hair of his head been harmed, Veroni, your life should have paid the forfeit."</p>
                  <p>"But my liberty?" said the ex-Duke of Parma, sullenly.</p>
                  <p>"The prince must answer you," said the Duke of Milan, "for he alone has here authority. Long live Giulio Veroni, Duke of Parma!"</p>
                  <p>The cry was taken up by all the soldiers present, and the arched hall rang with the acclaim.</p>
                  <p>"The coronet of Parma is yours," said the usurper, turning to the prince. "May it prove a lighter burthen to your brow than it was to mine. And now, duke, I await my sentence."</p>
                  <p>"I cannot forget," said Giulio, "that you are my father's brother, though you have striven to make me do so. You are free; I pardon you freely and fully."</p>
                  <p>"My presence shall not mar your triumph and your hap piness," said the usurper. "Yet I thank you for your mercy. May you be happy with my daughter. For me, my career is nearly runs; and I shall end it in the monastery at the foot of Monte Rosa."</p>
                  <p>This project, be it here remarked, the usurper carried into execution, and it is to be hoped that he died sincerely penitent. He soon retired from the presence of the victors, and was seen no more in the palace he had so long occupied, and so long disgraced by his tyrannies.</p>
                  <p>We shall not attempt to describe the joy of the meeting between Estella, the faithful Tonio and Giulio; nor that of Estella and Montaldo; nor the public festivities that took place when Giulio was proclaimed duke; nor the weddings of Giulio and the princess, by Estella and Ferrado. Suffice it to say, that these events, graced the presence of the good Duke of Milan, heralded a long and brilliant period in the history of Parma.</p>
                  <p>The idle minions that hung about the court (leeches on the treasury, and incubi on the people) were dismissed. The ducal train was reduced, expenditures curtailed, in short, rigid economy was the leading principle of the new administration. The holders of sinecures stood aghast at the complete revolution which was effected in the palace. The hireling ruffians that composed the standing army of the late duke, were paid to the uttermost farthing and dishanded, uttering fearful threats of turning robbers and ravaging the envirous of the city. But a splendid volunteer force raised to purge the country of brigands, soon put to flight this unprincipled soldiery, and Giulio showed his people that it was possible to command the respect of his neighbors, and maintain peaceful relations with them, without resorting to the menace of a powerful armament.</p>
                  <p>Though the church protested against it, yet, by command of Giulio, the remains of Magnus and of Zelie were committed to the grave with appropriate ceremonies, in the presence of the young duke himself. His generous heart did not deny a regret for the fate of the beautiful and strange being, who was such a mixture of good and evil—of impulse, passion and resolve.</p>
                  <p>The wit of Tonio the jester, when he became court fool, improved in quality, and he was universally believed to be the happiest mortal in the duchy. Indeed, he was often heard to remark that the cap and bells were a lighter weight to carry than the DUCAL CORONET.</p>

               <head>SKETCHES FROM THE BACKWOODS.</head>
               <head type="sub">BY MRS. MARY MAYNARD.</head>
               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>I.—THE WEDDING.</head>
                  <p>THERE was a gay party collected in Farmer Lynch's large parlor, to witness the marriage of Jessie Lynch, the acknowledged belle of the settlement, and Robert Grant, the handsomest young man "on the river." Numerous invitations had been sent, and as no one ever thought of sending excuses or apologies at Rivertown, the attendance was correspondingly large. Every instant brought fresh arrivals of blooming belles and their attendant beaux, each one at tired in their best, and vainly striving to look unconscious of the fact, their faces in a glow from the united effects of sunshine, exercise, and bashfulness, and their handkerchiefs in constant requisition to remove the pearly drops that beaded each brow.</p>
                  <p>The ceremony was to take place at two o'clock, and at half-past one the company were all assembled, with the exception of the bridegroom. An hour passed away, and still he came not. The minister took out his watch, and compared it with the farmer's clock; the two pretty bridesmaids played with the sashes of their pink muslin dresses, and cast anxious glances at the fair Jessie. She, poor girl, gradually grew paler and paler, until her cheeks rivalled her dress, and her blue eyes, filled with tears, were lifted piteously to the face of her brother, a splendid specimen of the young backwoodsman, who stood beside her chair, and cast anxious looks along the road. He was the sworn friend of young Grant, and as the minutes passed, and he was still missing, a heavy cloud came over Harry Lynch's usually bright countenance, betokening the trouble within.</p>
                  <p>The conversation, at first loud and noisy, grew gradually lower and less; and as the clock struck four, no sound broke the silence, save a sob from the now weeping bride. With a start, Harry roused himself from the thoughtful attitude into which he had fallen. Taking his sister's hand in his own, and turning to the assembled company, he announced his intention of going to seek his friend, declaring his conviction that something serious had happened to cause such a strange delay. His words were received with a murmur of applause, and he had stooped to whisper something in his sister's ear, when the door was thrown open, and in rushed a boy that Mr. Grant had brought up, and whose attachment to Robert all were aware of. Springing from her seat, Jessie caught the little fellow's hand in hers, and almost screamed:</p>
                  <p>"Where is he!"</p>
                  <p>Poor little Jake, with terror and excitement, was almost speechless, but after several choking attempts he managed to gasp out, "The bears<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7296-00000036"/> have got him!" The effect of this speech was electrical; every man in the room sprang to his feet—for the settlement was noted for the number, size, and daring boldness of these denizens of the woods; and not a few present bore the marks of serious battles with the monsters. With something between a sob and a groan, Harry caught hold of the boy, and succeeded in getting him to give some more definite explanation of the mystery.</p>
                  <p>Robert had left his father's house at eleven O'clock to go to the river in search of some white lilies for Jessie. Two hours passed, and his parents became alarmed at his long absence. The old gentleman, unable to bear it any longer, took his stick and set off in search, following the straight path to the river. What was his horror, on crossing a fence that went through the track, to see the place where a bear had been lying in the sun, the signs of a violent struggle, his son's hat, crushed and torn, and some pieces of his coat still wet with blood! He followed the trail, made in the grass, until it disappeared in the dense forest, and then returned to communicate the sad tidings to his almost distracted wife.</p>
                  <p>Robert was their only child—the last of a large family, who had all died in youth—and as the comfort and stay of the old couple, was by them almost idolized. They had looked forward with delight to his marriage with Jessie Lynch, who was as good as she was beautiful; and this dreadful blow at first paralyzed them with terror and grief. It was little Jake who first thought of letting the wedding party know of the sad accident, and without losing an instant, he mounted Robert's best horse, and made all speed to Mr. Lynch's, some four miles distant, there to bring sorrow and dismay by his tidings.</p>
                  <p>Harry let go the little fellow's shoulder—who, now his story was told, stood sobbing and wringing his hands—and in a hoarse, half-chocked voice, cried:</p>
                  <p>"To your horses, boys!" and he left the room to make ready for an instant start in search of the lost one.</p>
                  <p>In five minutes a dozen of them left the yard at a gallop, headed by Harry, whose noble dogs bounded along, half crazy with joy at the prospect of a hunt. But few of the party were armed at starting—the houses on their way being laid under contribution for rifles and ammuntion, so as to make as little delay as possible.</p>
                  <p>They had scarcely gone a mile, when Robert's beautiful horse passed them with a rush, little Jake being mounted on it like a monkey, and urging it to its greatest speed, eager to bear the news to the sorrowful parents. They met the young men at the gate, and with tears and blessings thanked them for their promptness in hastening to the assistance of their lost son, if assistance was not too late.</p>
                  <p>The old man would fain have gone with them, but this Harry would not hear of; he placed the tattered fragments of blood-stained cloth in his bosom, and wringing their hands with a farewell gripe, and shouting "Come on, boys!" dashed along the grassy path at headlong speed, while the tears actually rolled down his brown cheeks, and fell in hot drops on the hard hands that grasped the reins.</p>
                  <p>Poor Harry! his mind was travelling back to the days when Robert and he had learned to swim in the broad river; and one day, when half way across, he had given out, how bravely the slender youth had come to his rescue, supporting his sinking form, and bearing him safely to the shore, where, when he recovered, he found his preserver lying senseless, the blood gushing from his mouth, from the effects of his own exertion. From that hour they had been dearer to each than brothers, and many were the perilous adventures, numberless the dangers and escapes, they had passed through together since then.</p>
                  <p>We must now leave them to pursue their Journey, and return to the wedding party, so rudely broken up.</p>
                  <p>As their homes were widely scattered, and the men had taken the horses, it was impossible for the girls to return, and so they wandered round the house; and as evening came on, some of them assisted in the dairy, and some took charge of the household affairs, leaving Mrs. Lynch to attend to her daughter and entertain the minister, whose horse had gone with the others.</p>
                  <p>Poor Jessie sat pale and silent, smiling faintly when any one came and spoke cheering words to her, but evidently stunned with the shock. She was a true country girl, and knew nothing of fainting fits and hysterical screams; but there was a despairing look in her heavy eyes and white lips that more than once brought the tears into the kind minister's eyes, as he reminded her that there was One who did all things well, and to Him alone she could look for consolation in this, her hour of trouble.</p>
                  <p>There was one who never left her side for an instant, a fair, delicate girl, with large blue eyes and shining brown hair; a poor orphan, whom Jessie loved, and whom, if the gossips said truly, Harry loved too. Certain it is that, even in the hurry of his departure, he had found time to tell her to take care of his sister, and she had obeyed his commands to the letter. Poor Fanny Carrol's had been a lonely life; a dependent on the charity of strangers, and forced to repay their kindness by overworking herself, and taxing her strength beyond all reason.</p>
                  <p>Little wonder was it that she felt grateful to the warm-hearted brother and sister, who despised the littleness of some of the Rivertown folks, and treated Fanny like a sister, always inviting her to their parties, and seeming perfectly unconscious as to whether she came dressed in silk or calico—a line of conduct by no means imitated by their neighbors, who put a great deal of faith in dress. It was to this young girl that Jessie first confided the great secret of her engagement to Robert Grant, and now in her distress, Fanny's sweet voice fell like balm on her wounded heart.</p>
                  <p>We will now go back to Harry and his friends, who seen got the dogs on the track, and after some desperately rough riding, were obliged to leave their horses and follow on feet. The dogs found the bear at last. It proved to be a large female with two cubs, and after a severe battle, they were all three killed, and then the search was continued for Robert. As nothing could be seen to indicate that he had been killed, they supposed that he had made his escape, and crawled off into the woods; but even then he might faint and die from loss of blood, and Harry groaned aloud as some one made the very reasonable remark. With the pieces of cloth they got the dogs on his track, but the poor animals were torn and bleeding, and it required all Harry's coaxing to get them to follow it up.</p>
                  <p>The night was coming on, and then the hope of finding him in the dense forest would be less. Harry wiped his forehead, pulled his cap on firmer, and with an encouraging whistle to the weary dogs, and a shout to his lagging companions, he dashed forward with despairing energy. Suddenly the dogs raised a loud mournful howl, and hurried forward with increased speed. They had evidently come on a plainer track, and as the dismal sound echoed through the forest, Harry's heart sank heavy in his bosom; for that terrible cry told him they were on the scent of blood! A chorus of whining yelps, and then a prolonged howl, told the young hunters that the chase was ended; and when they came to the spot, it was to find Harry kneeling over the body of his friend, vainly trying to discover the faintest palpitation in his still warm bosom.</p>
                  <p>After bandaging his dreadful wounds, and making plentiful applications of cold water, but without the desired effect, they proceeded to construct a rough kind of litter, to convey him to Mr. Lynch's, from whose house they were not very far distant. A party returned for the horses, with orders from Harry to drive Mr. and Mrs. Grant over to his father's; and after carefully placing the insensible Robert on the leafy couch prepared for him, they set off on their slow and weary march, taking it in turn to carry their apparently dead friend.</p>
                  <p>They had passed the forest, and were almost in sight of the house, when Harry felt a slight movement under his fingers, which were pressed on Robert's wrist. They all moved forward with increased energy, and reached the house just as the old lady and gentleman stepped out of their wagon. There was a dreadful rush, and not a few screams, as they carried him into the light, and the state of his and Harry's clothes became visible; but the doctor soon had the room cleared, and with the young man's assistance, proceeded to apply such restoratives as soon had the desired effect.</p>
                  <p>Half an hour afterwards, his parents and Jessie were admitted; but as all conversation was forbidden, they could only kiss his death-like forehead, and offer up inward thanksgiving that he was still alive. On hearing that he was in no immediate danger, the wedding party gradually went home—all but Fanny, for whome permission had been obtained to remain all night with Jessie. It was midnight when the doctor went away; and as he insisted on all retiring but Harry, who had promised to sit up with the sick man, the old farm-house was soon wrapped in silence.</p>
                  <p>Ten minutes after the doctor's old carriage had clattered out of the yard, a gentle tap might have been heard at the door of Jessie's little chamber, where she, poor girl, was buried in a deep sleep, completely worn out with the events of the day. It was not an unexpected sound, as the immediate opening of the door showed; and when Fanny's little waist was so suddenly encircled by a pair of strong arms, and she, usually so timid, evinced no signs of fear, we<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC7296-00000037"/> may reasonably conclude that she had been forewarned in some mysterious manner of this unwarrantable proceeding; and even become convinced of it if we watch her as she lightly steps through the entry, and still encircled by the mysterious arm, enter the room of the sleeping Robert, and take possession of a sent very conveniently placed for her accommodation.</p>
                  <p>Of course we are not to decide what were Harry's reasons for securing Fanny's company on this particular night; it might be that he felt lonely and a little frightened at his unusual position; or, it might, be that her reputation as a sick nurse induced him to have such efficient, assistance at hand in case Robert should get worse; or it might be solely out of love for Fanny herself, and a desire for a little uninterrupted conversation; certain it is that when, towards morning, Robert awoke, weak and helpless, but in his right mind, he overheard Harry making an exceedingly sentimental speech, and ending with a question, to which Fanny, after sundry half-stifled sobs, whispered a very loving "Yes."</p>
                  <p>There is no doubt but that poor Robert speaks the truth when he says, that for an hour afterwards they never even looked at him; and he was deliberating on the propriety of asking for a drink, when the door was gently opened, and the flaxen head and the great gray eyes of little Jake confronted the astonished lovers, who just then made the discovery that it was morning. Fanny fled hastily, but not before the comic expression of Jack's face had made her cheeks burn crimson; and Harry bent over his friend with an appearance of great attention, and was evidently much relieved when he opened his eyes seemingly for the first time.</p>
                  <p>It was many days before Robert could tell them how he had jumped over the fence, almost on top of the old bear and her cubs; how she had seized him by the arm, tearing the flesh, and carrying him off in spite of all his efforts to the contrary; how she dragged him to the edge of the woods, and laying him down, deliberately set to work to tear him to pieces, which there is no doubt she would have done but for the cries of her young ones. Leaving him, she went to them, and he, taking advantage of her absence, crawled off into the forest as fast as his failing strength would permit. After going some distance, he tied his handkerchief and cravat round his arm to staunch the bleeding; but they soon came off, and after going as far as he could, he laid down, as he thought, to die. For weeks afterwards, he would start up in his sleep, imagining that he felt the bear's teeth crunching into his flesh; and the cool autumnal days had come before he was well enough to leave the hospitable roof of Farmer Lynch.</p>
                  <p>It was a beautiful day in October when the young folks once more gathered in the large, oldfashioned parlor to witness Jessie's marriage—not the only one this time, for when the group of girls enter the room, and Robert comes forward to take the hand of his bride, and lead her to the minister, another also claims a little trembling hand, and with a word of encouragement, leads forward a white-robed maiden.</p>
                  <p>In ten minutes the ceremony is performed, and Harry joyfully embraces his bashful partner, who looks as if she would fain hide herself from the many admiring eyes that are watching her. It is easy to see that young Mrs. Lynch will be treated very differently from poor Fanny Carrol by the good folks of Rivertown. Robert, if pale and delicate, looks no less happy than his friend, and Jessie only weeps because she is leaving her mother and the dear old home. The old folks are delighted, and Jake displays his exuberant joy in a noisy game of romps with Harry's great dogs, and devours an enormous quantity of the wedding cake.</p>
                  <p>Robert's adventure is the subject of many a winter's evening conversation, and he is often called on to tell the fearful tale, and display his wounded arm, the scars on which he will carry with him through life, as evidences of the bear's desperate onslaught, and as a token of his own almost miraculous deliverance from the very jaws of death.</p>

                  <head>II.—THE ROLLING FROLIC.</head>
                  <p>I had been in Rivertown only a few days, and had scarcely recovered from the effects of my journey from the distant city, when an invitation was sent to my young hostess and her husband, to attend a party at the house of a neighbor, three miles distant, who intended having a "rolling frolic" in the afternoon, and a dance in the evening.</p>
                  <p>Now as I had come into the country in the character of an invalid, and for the purpose of recruiting my strength, and, moreover, as my name was not included in the invitation, I steadily refused to listen to their persuasions, intending to spend a quiet evening with my books. This sober resolve was however destroyed by the second appearance of the little red-headed messenger, who had returned with a request from his sisters, that the "strange young gal" should accompany Mrs. Black, the following evening. To refuse now would have been an insult, and I sent word that I would accept the invitation, taking care to make Lizzie and her husband promise to return with me at ten o'clock.</p>
                  <p>The day of the party was exceedingly warm, and I sincerely pitied young Black when I found out what the afternoon's amusements were to be. In clearing the now land, after "chopping," the fallen trees are burnt, or set fire to and partly burnt; then the blackened logs are rolled together into large piles, and finally consumed. It was for this latter purpose that the invitations were sent to the neighboring young farmers on the day in question, and when I say it was the first week in August, and under a broiling sun, the idea of a "rolling frolic" assumes rather a serious form; setting aside the dancing in the evening, which of itself is rather hard work.</p>
                  <p>At four o'clock Lizzie and I locked up the house, and set off in our three mile walk to the scene of action, the air absolutely suffocating, and the dust ankle-deep in the roads. I was in mourning, and my black gauze dress gave me no little trouble to keep it out of the dust, which soon spoilt the appearance of our slippers, rendering it difficult to tell where the shoe left off, and the stocking began.</p>
                  <p>We soon overtook some young ladies on the same errand as ourselves, and I quite forgot my discomforts in examining the extraordinary fashions that were evidently "quite the rage" in Rivertown. Pink, blue, buff, or green calicoes, adorned these fair damsels, and though there was a great diversity in color and shade, they had all agreed on one point, and that was in having a full flounce, about a foot deep, round the bottom of each skirt. As the said skirts were very narrow, I was at a loss to imagine what possible use these additions could be.</p>
                  <p>The head dresses were either black or white lace, and with only one exception, the thirty-three young ladies, assembled on this occasion, wore some kind of curls, either long or short, looped up or flying loose—an exceedingly comfortable arrangement of the hair when the weather is considered, and that they had the prospect before them of a ten hour's dance.</p>
                  <p>I was greatly amused on approaching the scene of the afternoon's labors, to see the number of sooty-looking young men hurrying to the river's bank with their "best clothes" in bundles, there to perform their ablutions, and by-and-by make their appearance in all the glory of snowy linen, stiff stocks and broadcloth, to charm the fancies of the bewitching young damsels before mentioned.</p>
                  <p>On entering the house we were warmly welcomed by Mrs. Dickson and her two daughters, whose crimson faces and fiery-looking hands foretold the extensive preparations making for tea. Angeline Eliza, the eldest, was the very largest young woman it was ever my good fortune to meet with. She would have looked immensely tall but for her width, and enormously wide but for her height. As it was, I fairly shrank back as she came towards me; and not until I saw the exceedingly good-natured expression of her countenance, could I reconcile myself to the close companionship of one who could have tossed me out of the window with apparently as little trouble as a child would a kitten. Her sister, Maria Ruth—or "Ruthie," as her mother called her—bade fair to equal her in time, being now only fifteen, and weighing some hundred and fifty pounds. They were dressed alike—in the fashion, of course—and to describe the effect of the flounce on their extraordinary looking figures, would be impossible.</p>
                  <p>We found most of the company present, and when the gentlemen arrived—looking decidedly better for their visit to the river—we were all requested to "walk into tea." The tables consisted of long rows of boards, put up for the occasion, covered with snow white cloths, and loaded down with an immense quantity and variety of the most delicious eatables. I could not help thinking that I had discovered the secret of the extraordinary size of Mrs. Dickson's children (she had a son, exceedingly like Angelina, on a larger scale), as I looked on the tempting display of good things spread before us. To say that justice was done to the supper, would not give half an idea of the quantity of food consumed, and I was particularly amused in watching one tall, thin girl, attired in a delicate white muslin with little pink spots, and who looked as if she was ethereal enough to have lived on air, dispose of several slices of ham, half a dozen buttered cakes, with custars, tarts, preserves, tea and sweet cake, until I thought she must have given up all idea of dancing for that evening.</p>
                  <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7296-00000038"/>
                  <p>Tea over, we were all conducted to the dancing room, an immense barn-like unfinished place, originally intended for two or three rooms, but waiting till the owner finds means to finish it. Here the windows were darkened, and lots of home-made candles shed a brilliant illumination on the scene. I ensconced myself in a dark corner, and prepared to watch the proceedings. There were two fiddlers present, and for a quarter of an hour they kept up the most intolerable noise with their instruments, while several young men went round and selected partners from the rows of girls seated on benches round the room.</p>
                  <p>At last the violins were turned to please, and at a peculiar sound, sixteen persons took their places on the floor. I have not the slightest idea of what they danced, or how they danced it; I only know that they did it with all their might, keeping time to the quickest tune I ever listened to; the men occasionally varying the monotony of their movements by a violent stamp and the women, in performing the many whirls and turns that interspersed the figures, displaying some very substantially built ankles.</p>
                  <p>I was astonished to see Miss Arabella Thomson, the tall, slender young lady of the tea table, foremost in this most delightful dance the lightest of step, and the smartest to turn, of the whole sixteen. Facing her, was the fair Angeline, making extraordinary efforts to keep time to the tune, and in her endeavors to keep up with her partner, inventing some entirely new steps, and industriously mopping her immensely fat face all the time. Oswald Dickson had a little, short, dumpy partner, with a curly head, that just came up to his waist. She appeared to enjoy the fun amazingly, throwing back her head, and holding up her dress in front with both her little fat hands. Her appearance amused me very much, and I laughed aloud as she gave a concluding whirl, and made her overgrown partner a dumpy little curtsey just like herself. Not a moment was lost in forming another set, and with a different tune, sixteen more began the same violent exercise.</p>
                  <p>I had not thought of being asked to dance, and was sitting very snugly in the corner, when a tall young man came to me, and, with an awkward bow, held out his hand. This was the usual mode of asking for a partner, and I thinking to escape all further annoyance, immediately declared my ignorance of a single step. This did not have the desired effect, as he very obligingly professed his willingness "to learn me in five minutes," an offer I was so ungrateful as to decline, at the same time looking round for Lizzie to help me out of my difficulty. He grew so earnest about it, that at last I began to entertain fears that he would take me up in his great arms, and carry me out on the floor in spite of myself, when to my great relief the gentle Angeline appeared, and on my explaining to her that I was not able to undergo the fatigue, she very plainly desired him to go away, and find some one else, at the same time taking one of my poor, thin hands in her own tremendously large one, she as plainly hinted her opinion that "I was not long for this world."</p>
                  <p>At nine o'clock a young couple entered the room, and I was instantly attracted by their uncommon beauty. The girl appeared to be about twenty-two—or perhaps not quite so old; but she had a deeply troubled expression in her splendid dark eyes, and at times there was a look on her countenance that betokened an early acquaintance with care. She had a quantity of jet black hair, simply put up in hands, and her white dress fitted her figure closely, and hung full and gracefully around her, without trimming or ornament of any kind.</p>
                  <p>The young man was dark complexioned, with most beautiful hair, eyes and teeth, and was dressed with much better taste than most of the beaux present. The young folks gathered round them, and I heard the girl say, in answer to some question, that "Annie was very low tonight, and they could only stop a few moments." I felt an unusual interest in the strangers; but no one was near that I could ask any questions of, and after dancing once, and talking for a few moments with some of the party, they qutietly left the room.</p>
                  <p>When the clock struck ten I began to feel anxious to go home, being weary of the incessant noise and confusion, but when Simon Black made his appearance, it was to announce that the rain was pouring in torrents. Raspberry vinegar and cakes were now handed round, and after a short respite the dancing commenced again with renewed spirit, and it was kept up until one. By this time every one was feeling the united effects of the heat and exercise, and they commenced strolling about in couples, preparatory to securing some snug corner to hold a little sentimental conversation in.</p>
                  <p>Tired of sitting alone watching the manoeuvres of the would-be lovers, I started into the other rooms in search of Lizzie, whom I found sleeping ing on a wooden settle, with her head resting in her husband's arms, himself asleep. On an old sofa, in the corner of the kitchen, reclined the almost gigantic figure of young Dickson, with his great arm round the waist of the little dumpy girl, who was watching his slumbers with a very dissatisfied expression, evidently annoyed at his flagrant want of gallantry.</p>
                  <p>Bolt upright in another corner sat the tall young man who had so kindly offered to initiate me into the mysteries of the dance. He was making spasmodie efforts to keep awake, and trying to watch the proceedings of "Ruthie," and the slender young lady, who were busily engaged in making themselves some tea—I fancy in the hope of getting some also. In a small room off from the kitchen on a very moderately sized couch, reposed Angeline and five of her fair guests, a delightful arrangement for a cold night, but rather too close stowage for August.</p>
                  <p>At daylight the rain ceased, and the company began to stir and make preparations for departure. As I absolutely refused to mount an old gray mare, brought up to the door for my accommodation, a pair of boots were brought forward, and into them I manfully stepped, and set out on the homeward route, resolutely plodding through the mud, in many places ten or twelve inches deep.</p>
                  <p>It was sunrised when we got home, and tired, muddy, hungry, and most wretchedly sleepy, I went to bed, inwardly resolving, let me do what foolish thing I might, I would never attend another "Rolling Frolic." The ideal of going through such exertion, in such weather, and calling it pleasure, was simply ridiculous in my estimation, and it required no little effort to enable me to keep a steady countenance while listening to the departing guests assuring Mrs. Dicks on that "everything went off first rate;" that "it was a tip-top breakdown," "the best frolic on the river this summer," and numerous other flattering praises, which that good lady received with a comic expression of self-satisfaction on her round, good-natured face.</p>

               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>III.—THE CONSUMPTIVE.</head>
                  <p>I had learned from my friend Lizzie, that the strangers of the party, who had so attracted my attention by their different appearance from the rest of the guests, were the daughter and friend of a Mr. Gray, a gentleman in reduced circumstances and delicate health, who had come to the settlement in the spring, bringing with him a pale, careworn looking wife, and two daughters—Katie, the eldest, whom I have already described, and another, a poor, frail flower, already blighted with the disease that had robbed them of two noble sons, and was eating away the father's strength.</p>
                  <p>The young man was a Mr. Charles Curtis, the son of an old friend of Mr. Gray's, and on his father's death he had joined them in their expedition to the out of-way settlement of Rivertown. He had been betrothed to Katie in better days, when all was prosperity and sunshine; and now, when clouds darkened the sky, and sickness and poverty overwhelmed them, he was true to his love, content to wait her pleasure, so long as he could be near to assist and comfort her in her painful trials.</p>
                  <p>His own property was but small, but when united with the little remnant Mr. Gray had saved, they had found it sufficient to purchase a small farm, and creet a house large enough for their accommodation. This they had furnished with the remnants of former comfort, and in a style much superior to the neighboring farm-houses, their tastes and habits making many articles necessary, that to their neighbors seemed worse than useless. They had refused all invitations to visit among the gay folks of the settlement, and only accepted the invitation of the hospitable Dicksons, as a grateful acknowledgement of their many unostentatious acts of kindness.</p>
                  <p>I felt deeply interested in this little history, and scarcely knew which to admire most—the love and truth of the patient Charles, or the sisterly devotion of the beautiful Katie, who so faithfully performed her duty to the dying girl, dependent on her for care and attendance in her long, weary sickness. I was very anxious to know them better, but felt delicate about going unasked, as Lizzie said they were very shy of strangers, and I had no reasonable excuse to warrant such an intrusion.</p>
                  <p>I had almost given up the hope of making their acquaintance, when late one evening, long after I had retired, a loud summons called Mr. Black to the door, and on answering it, he met Charles Curtis, looking pale and anxious; and in answer to his astonished inquiries, heard the sad tidings that in a violent fit of coughing, poor Annie Gray had brought on an attack of bleeding at the lungs. He had come to borrow Mr. Black's horse, his own having got out of the<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7296-00000039"/> pasture; and as the doctor lived ten miles further down the river, in the Lynch settlement, there was no time to be lost.</p>
                  <p>Lizzie had hurried on her clothes, and was listening with tearful eyes to the distressing account of the state of affairs at Mr. Gray's, when a lucky thought struck her, and she mentioned my having been attacked with the same fearful complaint, and also that I had the proper medicines to take in case of a relapse or fresh rupture of a blood vessel.</p>
                  <p>She immediately came and awoke me, while the husband put the horse in the chaise, and in ten minutes I was seated, half awake and wholly stupid, beside Charles Curtis, and on my way to see the very family I had almost despaired of ever knowing, my little medicine chest at my feet, and my breathing apparatus defended from the damp midnight mists by sundry shawls and mufflers. It was now October, and the weather getting rather cold, so that I did not feel sorry when our ride was ended, and we drew up in front of a small, snug-looking house, with the light streaming from the open door and the chamber of the sick girl.</p>
                  <p>A tall, lady-like looking woman came out to meet us, but started, with an exclamation of surprise, when she saw who Charles was assisting to the ground. However, a few words from him set matters all right, and she clasped my hand with a warm pressure, and passing her arm round my shoulder, led me into the very neatest and brightest kitchen I ever was in, in my life. By the time Charles came in with the box of medicine, I had got rid of my shawls, and was ready to accompany them to the sick room. We passed through a short entry, and then softly opening the door, a sight presented itself to my gaze not easily forgotten.</p>
                  <p>Seated on the edge of a small French bed, was the beautiful girl I had admired so much at the party. Her hair hung disordered and unbound round her shoulders; over her night dress she had flung a large scarlet shawl, and her feet were partly covered by slippers. Her face was bent over the pale and death-like features that rested on her bosom, and her beautiful white arms were wound round the child-like form, supporting it in an easy position. At the foot of the bed knelt an old and very feeble looking man, with his face buried in his clasped hands, and the muslin drapery, suspended from the low ceiling, falling all over him. I soon had the mixture poured out, and never shall I forget the look of gratitude in Katie's beautiful eyes, as I handed her the spoon to give it to her sister. I knew from experience what the effect would be, and after she expressed a wish to be laid on the pillow, we all stood and watched her gradually sink into a deep sleep.</p>
                  <p>I had now an opportunity of seeing how perfectly angelic consumption sometimes makes its victims, in appearance, at least. Annie Gray, lying there, with her hands folded across her breast, her soft golden hair flowing over the white pillows, her delicate features composed to an expression of perfect peace, and her lips half parted, with a sweet smile, looked like some pure spirit about to return to its native skies.</p>
                  <p>That night, as, in the long hours, we kept watch beside the sleeping girl, Katie told me all her trials and sorrows. Her father was fast sinking under the power of consumption, her two Brothers had fallen victims to the same treacherous disease, the family had been subject to it for several generations, and yet she entertained hopes of saving Annie's life—Annie, who even now had the impress of death on her countenance. I actually trembled at the overwhelming love she displayed for her sister, when speaking of her engagement to Charles Curtis, and the motives that had induced her to dissolve it. "I shall never marry," she said, "but when Annie gets better, will devote my whole time to my father and mother;" and when I hinted that his friendship and love deserved a better return, she said that her only hope was that he might one day love some one who had no other duties to interfere with his happiness. I felt almost inclined to doubt if she really loved him, so little did she speak of her own feelings, and was half tempted to think her cold hearted, for so neglecting his long enduring affection.</p>
                  <p>From this time I became an intimate visitor at Annie Gray's bedside, relieving Kate of much of her charge, and sharing the love the invalid so freely bestowed on those who were kind to her. It was a very severe winter, and frequently for three or four days, the roads would be quite impossable. On such occasions, Annie would have the curtains undrawn, and pass the time watching for my coming, her window overlooking the road. She was exceedingly patient under her trials, always thankful for anything to relieve her cough or remove the weary pain that prevented rest or sleep, and never speaking a hasty or impatient word.</p>
                  <p>The winter passed very slowly to us all; to Charles, who, unused to farm work and exposure, suffered from the effects of the cold; to Annie, who longed for the bright, warm sunshine and the flowers, and whose delicate system was susceptible to every change of the atmosphere; to Mr. Gray and his wife, who missed their comfortable city rooms, and crept about the house enveloped in thick shawls and dressing-gowns; to Katie, who believed that with the spring strength would come to her darling sister; and to me, who missed my walks and rides, and who fretted at being shut up in the house three or four days in the week.</p>
                  <p>At last the snow went away, the river burst its icy bands, the little leaf buds appeared on the trees, and the sun shone from a blue sky. But alas! with the frosts and snows, vanished our hopes and fond anticipations; the certainly of Annie's speedy removal was apparent to all but her sister, and Mr. Gray's little remaining strength gave way, and he also laid his head on the pillow, to come no more among us.</p>
                  <p>For three days the sick girl had suffered fearfully from an incessant cough, and on the morning of the fourth, as I held her supported in my arms (the only position in which she could find rest), she suddenly opened her eyes, and seeing the tears on my face, seemed grieved that I should suffer such distress on her account. She spoke with unusual strength and energy, and gave me many directions as to what to do when she was gone. "Katie will not believe I am dying, but you know I am, and when I am gone, I wish her to marry Charles—he has been a good brother to me;" then bidding me call them in, she lay back on the pillow, pale and exhausted. They instantly obeyed my summons (all but the dying father), and it was heart-breaking to witness the agony of her who had so fondly hoped for an impossibility, as she became convinced that the shadows stealing over that beloved face were cast by the hand of death.</p>
                  <p>She would have flung herself frantically beside the dying girl, had not Charles restrained her, and clasping her convulsed form in his arms, she hid her face in his bosom. We scarcely knew when the gentle spirit left us, so calm and silent was the parting, and when Charles turned to lead the breaved sister away, it was an inanimate form he bore in his arms. Mrs. Gray went about with her usual calmness, her cheek a shade paler, but with no other sign of the deep sorrow at her heart; leaving her dead child, to attend to the wants of her dying husband, and finding time to speak words of consolation to the almost distracted Katie.</p>
                  <p>The poor old father joined his children before another sun had set, and on the following Sabbath the neighbors gathered round the house of mourning to bear to the tomb the senseless clay of those, whose spirits had forever left the world of sad partings, to wait in a happy land for those loved ones still on earth.</p>
                  <p>It was long before Katie recovered from the shock of Annie's death and the effects of her protracted exertions through the winter; but rest and quiet had their effect, and one beautiful summer evening, when we had walked out to admire the beauty of the sunset, and listen to the robins singing their evening song, I told her what the dying girl had said about her wishes in respect to Charles. I was almost afraid to see what effect my words would have; but when, surprised at her silence, I stole a glance at her averted face, it was to behold the tears running down her flushed checks, and every symptom of confusion depicted on his countenance. A good prospect for Charles's success, thought I, and as he joined us in a few minutes, I gradually lingered behind until they got fairly out of sight, and then ran home to play some of Mrs. Gray's favorite pieces on their elegant piano, one of the articles Charles had insisted on saving from the wreck of their splendid city establishment.</p>
                  <p>I know not what arguments the young man used to convince Katie, but six months after Annie's death, I stood beside her as she gave him her hand, and listened to the words that joined them for life. It was a very quiet wedding, quite unlike the style in which such affairs are usually conducted in Rivertown; but then the circumstances were to be considered, and though some few thought they ought to have been invited, and felt a little inclined to be angry at the neglect, it all passed away when the bride appeared at meeting, and received the kind congratulations of her neighbors with such sweet mingled smiles and tears, and looking so beautiful in her mourning, which she still persisted in wearing, that more than one kind-hearted farmer's wife shed tears, as she wished her joy.</p>
                  <p>I had delayed my return to the city, for the purpose of assisting at the wedding, and now, having seen them all happy and in a fair way to do well, I had to bid them adieu, but not before making a promise to return in the course of another year. I had become fondly attached to the whole family, and they had supplied the vacancies<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7296-00000040"/> cancies left in my heart by the death of various dear relations. Katie wept bitterly when we parted, and kissed and embraced me again and again. Even Mrs. Gray was moved to tears, and Charles expressed his intention of running away from us, for fear he, too, should grow sentimental.</p>
                  <p>It was nearly two years before I again visited the Rivertown settlement. Many circumstances had occurred to keep me in the city, and even Katie had to acknowledge that my excuses were good ones. We had kept up a pretty regular correspondence, but now three months had gone by, and I had heard nothing from my old friends. I knew, by her former letters, that worldly affairs were prospering with them, that her mother, in her daughter's happiness, renewed her own young days, that Charles was a model husband, fondly beloved by his beautiful wife, and as warmly attached to her, that Katie herself was the happiest of wives and daughters. She also told me that under Charles's care and good management, the house and farm looked very differently; that her garden was the pride of Rivertown, her poultry unsurpassed in the settlement. I rejoiced to hear such favorable accounts of the circumstances of my friends, and anxiously expected the time to come when I should be able to once more leave the city to visit their country home.</p>
                  <p>I did not inform them of my intention, determined to punish them for their silence by taking them by surprise; and it was with a beating heart that I once more found myself close to the residence of those who had experienced so many of the trials and troubles of this life, and in whose present happiness I felt such a deep interest. I had seen mingled pain and happiness, myself, in the past two years; dear friends had been removed, and beloved ones were missing, in my household circle; but to sweeten the bitterness, a new, strange feeling had arisen in my heart, soothing troubles and lightening trials and griefs—a feeling so interwoven with my hopes of happiness, that I actually shuddered when I thought of how often the fondest anticipations are crushed and unfulfilled, and dared not trust myself to think what my state would be, should my hopes be destroyed.</p>
                  <p>I had long imagined Katie's warm congratulations, when I should tell her this news, and already I fancied I felt her affectionate kiss and saw the long loving look from those beautiful eyes, that first won my fancy. It was night when I arrived at the house, and sending back the carriage that had conveyed me from the nearest village, walked alone up the broad new carriage-road to the door.</p>
                  <p>I entered without ceremony, and passing through one dark room, went towards a door, from which the light streaming underneath gave token of some one being there. I unclosed it gently and gazed on an unexpected scene within. Dressed in white and seated in a well stuffed easy chair, was my friend Katie, looking very charming, and yet very much like an invalid; on a couch beside her, and with his arm resting on her chair, was Charles, his whole countenance expressive of proud happiness. A strange young woman was standing beside Katie, and she, too, appeared very much delighted with something; while Mrs. Gray was seated on a low ottoman, her head bent down in an admiring position over something she held in her lap. My curiosity was aroused, and opening the door wider, I stepped forward to discover this wonderful cause of so many smiles, when what should I see (while a chorus of voices greeted me), but a bundle of muslin, lace, and cashmere, snugly nestled up in Mrs. Gray's arms, and in an instant the problem was solved.</p>
                  <p>I never could account for the reason, but my usual enthusiasm for specimens of diminutive humanity, like the present one, was wonderfully cooled; and I actually felt jealous of the little unconscious innocent, that deprived me of so much of Katie's time and attention. I had anticipated so much pleasure in informing her of my own intended marriage, and had expected so much sympathy in my hopes and fears, that I felt not a little mortified to discover that anything, unconnected with her baby, had but little interest in my friend's eyes, and claimed but little of her attention; and the day of my departure drew near, and I had not told her my cherished secret.</p>
                  <p>It is true, I had got over my first feelings of annoyance towards the little intruder, who had so unceremoniously usurped my friend's affections, and would kiss it, and talk nonsense to it, with any of them; but Katie never asked me any questions about my future prospects, more than to make some inquiries as to the amount of property I had become possessor of, and for which I had paid the penalty of being relation-less in the world. My visit was very pleasant; but I missed Katie's company in my walks and excursions, and did not grieve when the day arrived rived that was to bring my friend to escort me home. Several young ladies, the aristocracy of Rivertown, had come to spend the day with us, and there was quite an excitement when the handsome carriage came dashing up to the door, and a tall, elegant looking man descended, and was warmly welcomed by Charles Curtis, the cordial greeting proclaiming them old friends. There was a great fluttering among the girls, and sundry anxious inquiries as to the appearance of curls and collars, and not a few ran to the glass to assure themselves that they looked their prettiest, when the gentlemen were seen approaching the house. Even Katie looked a little flushed and hastily collected some scattered pieces of the work that had employed our busy fingers all the morning, and straightened the disarranged dress of her precious boy, who had been handed round among the young ladies, and tossed and caressed, until he looked much less neat than his mother usually kept him. A little black eyed witch had him in her arms, and I was amused to see how nervously she assisted Katie in pulling down the baby's dress, and gave an extra twist to her own shiny black curls. I listened to their hurried exclamations of "who is he?" "who can he be?" with as straight a face as I could assume, and as they did not condescend to address their questions to me, I did not think it worth while to give them the information they wanted. I moved my seat into the window recess, and bent my head closely over my work, listening, with a beating heart, to the well known footstep. Charles first introduced his wife, and then, with a bow to the young ladies, announced the stranger as his friend, Mr. Leonard. They could not see me where they stood, and when they came nearer, and the same ceremony was gone through with me, it was with a steady face that I bowed in return, and taking the hint, he also assumed an unconscious look, that completely deceived them all.</p>
                  <p>Charles would not hear of Mr. Leonard's departing under three days, at least, and as he laughingly said his business was not very pressing, it was agreed that he should be their guest for that time, and plans were immediately laid for giving him some idea of how country folks enjoy themselves. A picnic for the ensuing day was unanimously decided on, and the young ladies were evidently very much pleased with the prospect of having the handsome stranger to entertain. After a very pleasant afternoon and evening, the party separated, attended by their brothers or friends; the little black eyed girl, alone, had no escort, and when Mr. Leonard politely offered his protection, there were many nods, and smiles, and whispered remarks, for Hattie Brown was a little flirt, and had had more lovers than any other girl in the settlement, and still boasted that she was heart free. I found an opportunity to slip a little note into his hand before parting for the night, telling him in it how I wanted to mystify Katie and the girls; and as the family had no idea that we had ever met before, I thought it a good opportunity to punish Katie for her neglect of me and my affairs, as I knew she would like to hear the story now.</p>
                  <p>The picnic, next day, passed off delightfully. Mr. Leonard was very attentive to Hattie Brown, and the other girls were very attentive to him, all pronouncing him the handsomest man ever seen in Rivertown. Even the young men could not find fault with him, he was so affable and kind to all, and entered so heartily into the enjoyments of the excursion.</p>
                  <p>I had no opportunity of conversing alone with my friend Until the evening before his departure, and then it was merely to tell him I should be all ready to go at the time he had set.</p>
                  <p>The next morning, they were all surprised, at breakfast, by his informing them that he intended taking me away that day; and when, in answer to their inquiries as to the cause of such a strange proceeding, he told of our engagement and approaching marriage, there was a very reproachful look in Katie's dark eyes, that did not<pb n="84" xml:id="VAC7296-00000041"/> go away until he also told her why I had played! her such a trick. She had to confess that if I did not give her my confidence, it was because she did not deserve it; and so, with their best wishes and kindest congratulations, we left their hospitable roof, and returned to the scenes of city life, so familiar to us both, but bearing in our minds the pleasantest recollections of the happy visit we had made to the "Backwoods."</p>
                  <p>I have visited Rivertown many times since these events took place, and have had the pleasure, of always finding my friends prospering and very happy. Katie's baby, that once so occupied her mind, now shares her attention and love with five other little treasures; and I often smile at my childish jealousy, and have learned to make great allowance for the absorbing delight of young mothers, since a similar source of joy and pride has been given to myself.</p>
                  <p>Hattie Brown was so unmercifully teased about her conquest of the handsome stranger, that she wisely gave up her flirting propensities and finally married a young farmer, and is now as steady a matron as Rivertown can boast of.</p>
