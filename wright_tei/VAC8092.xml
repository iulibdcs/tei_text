OH DEAR, another miserable, worthless day before me. How long is this, loathsome farce to last? How long am I doomed to drag this contemptible carcass about the earth? How many more weary months must I linger here, a eye-sore to my friend a nuisance: to myself? When, oh when; will the blessed day of release come, -that I may go .down quietly to my grave, and .be resolved intp my kindred dust? Why, why was I ever pemitted:to see (day-light?

Sir, I am not convinced- nor do I like the dictatorial tone of your remarks. Grumble I will-it is the sick man's privilege. , I uwish to know why I am tormented thus? What vile offence must my poor soul have committed in some pre-existent state, that it, has thus been con- "demned to ignominious imprisonment in such a pitiful humbug of a body as this--look at me- 'what a lantern-jawed, guinea-visaged, hollow-eyed scarecrow have I become-a mere bag of sorry -bones.

Patience, patience, patience, my dear boy, think of poor old Job, and his patriarchal sufferings- studded with boils, tormented by a vixen of a wife, teased and insulted by hypocritical visitors-what are your experiences, compared with his? think of that, and so possess thy soul, and gulp down thy pills in patience.                   Pills, forsooth! have I not been gulping them down continually, for the last quarter of a century? hundreds of thousands of them, of all sorts, sizes and denominations? Blue, Life, Health, Dinner, Assa- foetida, Paradise Pills? I verily believe that I have tossed down more of these balls into my stomach, than there were votes polled at the last federal election--yes more than there were ever confetti thrown, at the gayest Carnival of Rome.

Heavens I what a mon- ster sheet-it is really a job to fold it--why six irritable fellow-citizens might read abreast here, without any excuse for growling or hustling. If it keeps growing at this rate, the Times will soon be a mere chicken alongside of it; and as to those poor little starvelings that they call Journals in France, and Austria. and Italy, they sink into absolute nothingness. What says the editor? "We present to our readers," &amp;c., "unwieldy as it may seem, we assure them that it is quite too small to be a faithful mirror of the world's doings, or an adequate ex- ponent of the wants of our vast, momently growing, and ever dearly beloved Gotham"-you say truth, no doubt, most amiable of pen-wielders-the world's doings, indeed-no trifle, they, ,in our day-how vast, how manifoldl Has there ever before been such a stir and bustle in this planet of ours? Can it be, that our brethren in the other orbs of space are so full of business? if so, what an active, enter- prising universe it must be. How proud we ought to be to belong to it!

Is theology to go by the boards? are metaphysics to be forgotten? are the higher mathematics to be abandoned to the angels? May we no longer chop logic as well as wood? are the flowers of rhetoric to wither on their stalks? Is jurisprudence to be deprived of her fair-proportions? Is science only to be valued, as she may minister to our comfort? Is Art herself to forget all that is lofty and holy in her calling, and to become a mere turnspit in the service of Appetite?

Do we even comprehend the meaning of this spirit- ual peace, these heaven-anticipating visions? we, 'who live in this " great center of commercial inter- ests," as we proudly call it, this bustling, crowded, Grand Cafeof a town-we bury the Doctor's books, to be sure-we give them an honorable place in our libraries. But do we read them with decided relish? Would we, on the whole, consider it a privilege to have an hour's talk, per-diem, -with the author'? Do we sympathize with him in these lofty views of his? Would we care to accompany him in these heaven- ward flights? I think I hear an overwhelming ma- jorityr reply, promptly and honestly, no, no, no--we are in no hurry for these celestial entertainments-- give us a snug perch, close alongside of dear old mother earth-we would not be super-spiritual yet a Wliile-we are for hugging, and making much of   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.      i9 the good things about us. We decidedly prefer getting together over our pipes and punch-bowls, and discussing crops, trade, and politics--if con- science will, now and then, ask impertinent ques- tions, or if fancy will paint disagreeable pictures of the life to come, why, then we smoke all the more furiously, and drink the more deeply. Miserable deluded creatures, that say thus, if not always with their lips, at least in their lives-and yet we inva- lids are quite as bad in our way, quite as great earth- worms--are we not forever chattering about our groans and pains? Do we not gloat over and make as much of our pills and our purges, our tonics and our gruels, as our brethren, the epicures, do of their fricandeaux and their foie-gras, their wines and their salads? But surely there is some shadow of an excuse, in our case. Nature herself seems to have condemned us to be mere animals-ay, wilfully to have closed the gates upon us, were we ever so much disposed to enter any of the broad avenues of business, philanthropy, or study. If I, for instance, were to continue even these idle pen-ramblings for an hour longer, or were to read half a dozen more pages of the Review of Fenelon, what would be my reward?

Say, why is this? Tell us, ye ready readers of life's riddles, why are the gifts of nature and of for- tune distributed in this capricious, this abominable manner?! What have I done, that I should be cursed with this miserable constitution? My pa- rents have both been uniformly hale and hearty. I have committed no excesses, either in the way of pleasure or of study, that can account for my suffer- ings, No, I have been a sorry, rickety concern from the start-as an infant, my, kickings were fee- ble, my squallings tame and short-lived; as a boy, I had no strength for running, or kite-flying, or even marbles.

You would like, no doubt, you young scamps, to be in the woods at this moment, there combin- ing and confederating with your kinsmen, for the purpose of eating us all up, and having the planet to yourselves--yes, you would like to be sucking my breath, and scratching out my eyes, this blessed minute-off with you, sc--t' sc-t. This is Election Day, and we are all urged by our brethren of the press, in leaders of unusual fervor, to rush early to the polls, and deposit our votes; it seems that the country is more than ever in danger, this fine frosty morning. I can't help it, for one, I shall not budge an inch. What, wilfully run away from the discharge of this imperative duty? blindly waive the exercise of this sovereign right? throw away this choicest flower of your prerogative?

I shall stay away, simply because I have not strength and nerve sufficient fairly to meet those annoyances which I am sure to encounter, if I go. I have quite too vivid a recollection, I assure you, of the scrape I got into, whilst exercising the elective franchise, last season. What did I gain by that experiment? Was I not detained, hustled, bruised? Were not my corns trod on? Did I not part company for ever with the larboard skirt of my coat? Was not my hat cut off in the flower of its youth? And did I not overhear myself called, several times, a cursed old Federalist? And was not one of these- very traducers, a servant whom I had turned off a few days before, for stealing my wine? And did not his vote destroy all the efficacy of mine? And did I not the next morning find, as usual, that I had been voting with a hopeless minority? And do you presume to ask me to make the same fool of myself to-day? I shall do no such thing, I assure you. Ay, but the union of these States--the blessed union itself, my dear sir, is in danger. I am. sorry to hear it, gentlemen, but really if it be in such a rickety condition, that its salvation depends upon the votes of a few invalids, why, the sooner it goes by the board, the better.

I have no more doubt that, whichever of the two sets of candidates be chosen this day, the great, permanent, substantial interests of the union will be duly watched and protected, than I have that the boats will go up the river to-morrow, or the cars leave for Boston. At the same time, I am equally convinced that, in the present excited state of the public mind, there will be, in all human probability, as there was last year, a most disgusting scuffle at the Polls, which, as a sick man, I would fain dodge-so leave me, if you please, to the peaceful enjoyment of my morning gown and slippers. Disunion, forsooth! pray, where are these mighty men, these political Samsons, who threaten to bring down this glorious fabric about our ears? who would fain demolish this, the most solid, magnifi- cent structure that legislators ever erected for the admiration and imitation of mankind?

Even then, would we have had any good excuse for murmuring and rebellion?

Why were we not con- fined to one kind of grain, or one sort of berry, instead of this prodigal display of luscious fruits, and tender roots, and savory herbs? How dare I scold, and regret, and repine at my lot, when I think of all these luxuries and delicacies and beauties innumerable-when I think of the glowing cheek of the peach, the fragrance of the rose, the stately plumes of the ostrich, the sweet song of the nightingale-when I think of prattling brooks, and sparkling waterfalls, and gently gliding rivers, and the dancing waves of ocean? Nay, I have but tp look at the delicate, glancing gold-fish in yonder vase, to know and to feel, not merely the power and wisdom, but the unspeakable goodness of my Creator.

Well, well, well, let's laugh while we can; heaven knows there's enough to cry about, in this strange world of ours.

I must take the liberty of differing from these gentlemen. I can't help thinking that the nineteenth century, at least, will be gathered to its fathers,; before the cultivation of the Anglo-Saxon language and literature will be considered a neces- sary part of the education of the young men of Tobolsk, or eke of Irkutsk; nor do I believe that there will ever be a very furious rush for the Waverley Novels in Kamschatka.

And yet, is your mere goodness worth having, after all?  What signifies a kind heart, unaccompanied by any vigor of body or mind? praiseworthy intentions, with neither health, wealth, nor talent, to aid and abet them, and bring them to any practical account? who wants to be an amiable nobody? an exemplary cipher? to have a character so intrinsically feeble and insignificant, that it is of no manner of consequence to the world, whether it be in repair or in decay, in cloud or in sunshine. Such a spectacle, is it not almost as mel- ancholy as to behold brilliant talents enlisted in the service of vice? nay, far more so; for there is always some hope of reclaiming the one, but what under Heaven can ever be made out of the other?-a good- natured imbecile, forsooth.

Poor soul, his last sickness, they say, was quite too much in keeping with the whole tenor of his life-it seems that the stupid old fool of a nurse that waited-upon him, would persist in mis- taking tonics for cathartics, and cathartics for tonics, till the patient was really cheated and worried out of existence, in the most unseemly, disgraceful manner--and when, at last, the breath was out of his body, even then, it seemed as if Fortune were determined to have one more malicious grin at his expense-for while they were rendering the last sad offices to his remains, the hearse that was convey. ing them to their final resting-place, most per- versely, parted company with one of its wheels- this frightened the horses, who began to cut up a variety of most unseasonable capers, to the great an. noyance of the mourners and friends, and the ill- smothered merriment of the heartless bystanders, Is it to be wondered at, that a man thus vexed, and irritated, and pestered, should occasionally have  &#xD;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC8092-00000114"/> 282      MU'r1TItcINGS AND lost heart and patience?

But to be made a perfect ass, and a butt of, to be the mere theme of her Ladyship's laughter, 'twas more than mortal man could bear." Is it strange, that he should get angry, and fall to curs- ing his unlucky stars-and at times that he should question the ways of Providence, and think it hard that the great Creator, who sees "alike the hero perish, and the sparrow fall," should permit the life of any creature of his thus to be turned into a nuisance and a torment? Well, well, well--peace be with thee, old friend. I trust that thou art now having a quiet time of it, art enjoying a sweet, dreamless sleep, and that when thou awakest, thou wilt enter upon a scene of pleasing duties, of tran- quil enjoyments, unvexed by the thousand annoy- ances, unvisited by the " thousand natural pangs that flesh is heir to." MY good genius took me to the theatre last   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.     233 night, to see Richard the Third--ah, what an en- tertainment! I wouldn't have missed it for a good many bushels of gold dust. Never was the usurper in higher health and spirits-never before have I seen one half the amount of exercise taken in the part-such a knocking together of gloves, such a clatter of boots! How he did fly about, to be sure. What infernal faces he kept making up-what an outlay of lungs-what a perpetual making of points, from the very first line of the soliloquy, up to the great final fight. Such a fight, too-there seemed to be no end to it. The tyrant seemed de- termined not to give up the ghost, come what would-punch, punch, punch, went Richmond's blade, through and through him, at leastoa score of times; still he kept at it, as brisk as a bee, as full of sound and fury as ever, to the evident surprise and disgust of his antagonist, and to the great edifica- tion of an intensely excited pit-when he was fairly quieted at last, after a world of kic,king,-and floun- dering, and gasping, then the feelings of the audi- ence were poured forth in such a mingled torrent of yells and cheers, as, young and ardent Demo- cratic Republicans alone know how to give-'twas a glorious tribute to genius-one hardly knew which to admire most, the performance itself, or  &#xD;<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC8092-00000115"/> 234      M UT'ITEINGS AND this cordial, beautiful recognition of its merits. If tradition speak truth, how very flat and stupid, in comparison, must Garrick and Henderson have been in this part--how tame and inefficient the versions of Cooke and Kean-my neighbor didn't think so, though-it was clear that this superb piece of act- ing was completely- thrown away upon him-but then he was an Englishman-a bilious, bigoted Englishman-confound him, in some of the most thrilling passages, I overheard him muttering to himself, what an infernal humbug---and when the curtain dropped at the close, he had the audacity to pronounce aloud the words atrocious swindle, and then rushed out of the box, slamming the door vio- lently after him. Ah dear, such is the force of vile, vile prejudice-the conceited old wretch-as if he had ever heard anything half so fine, at Drury Lane, or Covent Garden, either. And yet, to be candid, it must be confessed that the play was not so-judiciously cast throughout, as it might have been. For instance, was it altogether the thing, to put those two fat, red-faced women, each weighing her two hundred and fifty pounds, in the parts of Lady Anne and Queen Elizabeth? Was there anything regal or interesting in their appearance or movements? Again, were those two dirty,   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.    235 shabbily dressed brats, that spoke so through their noses, and made such frightful havoc with the text, anything like adequate representatives of the lovely i    young princes? Was it in keeping with the char- acter of the timid, amiable, philosophizing King Henry, to be so frightfully over the bay as he was? -so much so, indeed, that he could hardly stand up to be stabbed by the tyrant? Wasn't it rather cruel, too, in the manager, to thrust that poor fellow, who- was evidently laboring with a severe touch of bronchitis, into the arduous part of Buckingham? there were little slips, moreover, in the matters of scenery and costume, that ought not to have been made, in an establishment of such princely re- sources. What right had Richard to woo Lady Anne, in St. Mark's Place, Venice? Why did Richmond address those encouraging remarks to his troops, in a pass in the Tyrol? and, above all, what business had the American flag to wave over the field of Bosworth? Why should the usurper have fellows in his pay, who, by all the laws of dress, ought to have been at Salamis, or Marathon? And why did that individual in the cocked hat and drab breeches perform such feats of valor on the Lancasterian side? Hang him, he was at least four centuries before his time-he ought to have been  &#xD;<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC8092-00000116"/> 236      MUTTERINGS AND- earning those laurels at Saratoga, or at Benpningto:l. But I am hypercritical, perhaps-after all, these were mere spots upon the - sun-the glorious, the magnificent, the intensely intellectual RicharJ. atoned for them all, an hundred-fold. It is, indeed, an epoch in one's life, the witnessing such a perform- ance. 'Twas something, doubtless, to have seen a Siddons, or a Kemble, in Macheth--to have heard the pleasant voice, the merry laugh of Mrs. Jordan, in Rosalind -to have seen the School for Scandal, or Twelfth Night, cast as Lamb describes them-- but oh, how they would have all failed and faded into insignificance, before the superb demonstration of last night! Why couldn't Lamb have been present, and Coleridge, and Manning and Hazlitt, and the rest of them? Poor fellows, they lived a half a century too soon. Ah well, let me be grate- ful, profoundly, lastingly grateful for this unpre. pedented dramatic treat. OF all the polite and amiable men that have made their bows, or waved their beavers, since the Flood, my excellent friend  certainly bears the bell., I speak not of mere skin-deep politeness   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.     237 conventional civility-oh, no; his is a thorough- going, bona fide, unremitting courtesy-a suavity springing from the heart, and pervading and ani- mating every muscle and bone of his body. Let him that doubts but behold him, as he makes his entree in a drawing-room, and above all, observe him while he is discharging the arduous duties of New Year's day-what a thorough dedication of the whole man is here to the great task before him; what profusion of compliments does he keep pouring forth--what frequent, earnest, hearty hand- shakings for his intimate friends; what effective and eloquent bows for the rest. What deep duckings and divings of the upper portions-what nimbleness and suppleness in the leg department--yes, a sweep of full ninety degrees, in that last conge. Surely this man means something--this is no joke, but a veritable labor of love. At times, indeed, to say truth, my friend's politeness is almost a source of annoyance to those about him. I have known him, for instance, under the influence of this feeling, per- form, in the aisle of a church, a series of picturesque and animated evolutions, quite as ill-timed as they were well meant, and which have sadly discomposed the nerves of the more sophisticated occupants of the adjoining pews. At other times it is merely lu-  &#xD;<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC8092-00000117"/> MUT'l'ERINGS AND dicrous. I happened to be with him in the street the other day, when a drove of hogs passed by. Now, is so amiably disposed towards all God's crea- tures, that this feeling, aided and abetted by the courteous practices of near half a century, absolutely impelled him to take off his hat to them. Soon after this occurrence, a most shabby and worthless- looking terrier made his appearance, and would persist in gettihg in -'s way, once or twice nearly tripping him up. Any other man, under such circumstances, would have said very promptly, Get out, with a kick probably, and possibly with some disrespectful allusion to the terrier's mother. All that could be forced out of  was a gentle wave of the hand, and "Make room, if you please.  I even fancied once that I saw him actu- ally bowing to a roast turkey, just before proceed- ing to carve it-absurd as it appeared, I neverthe- less interpreted it into a sort of apology to the great family of turkeys, for the apparent heartlessness and cruelty of the transaction-in the same spirit he would no doubt ask pardon of a rose-bush for rob- bing it of its flowers; nay, of a very mosquito, for injuring it while in the very act of biting him-so deep, so abiding is the kindness of this man's heart. Thus has it been with him, they say, from the be-   ginning; his nurses are reported to have said that he was the best infant that ever drew breath-that when weaning time came, he manifested a spirit of resignation most creditable to him-that amidst all the terrors of teething, he behaved beautifully. His school-mistresses and masters all agreed in rep- resenting him as the quietest, most docile pupil they ever had; that the birch and the ferule, that were plied so continually and so vigorously all around him, never alighted on his innocent little person; they are said to have added, that they did not be- lieve he had ever murdered a fly, or pelted a frog, in the whole course of his boyish career. And yet there are those who, incapable of comprehending so rare a goodness, have utterly misinterpreted these manifestations of it, and have even gone so far as to insinuate that my old friend is somewhat out of his head, which they most absurdly attri- bute to his having been crossed in love some years since-others have impudently thrown out the idea, that there have always been a good many vacant apartments in his attic, while a third class do not scruple to avow that they believe him to be a great rogue at bottom; taking it for granted, that he in- dernnifies himself for all this outlay of civility in public, by all kinds of secret meannesses and ras-  &#xD;<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC8092-00000118"/> 240      MUTTERINGS AND calities. Abominable, atrocious libels these, alike upon his head and heart. He is as intelligent and sensible as he is honest and warm-hearted; he is indeed of the excellent of the earth; God keep him long upon it; we can't spare such a delightful old neighbor and peace-maker; there are quite too few of them in this brawling, wrangling world of ours. Yes, old friend, sero in colum redeas. And when thou takest thy departure, may I be graciously per- mitted to accompany thee. I would fain be by, when thou presentest thyself for admission at the celestial gate. What a profusion of bows, saluta- tions, and acknowledgments wilt thou bestow on holy Peter. I greatly fear that the heavenly Jani- tor, if he retain any portion of the impulsive tem- perament that he had here below, will lose patience and exclaim, "Come in, friend, come in; have done with all those flourishes and fine speeches, and enter, enter freely." And then with what a pleas- ant smile wilt thou greet thy old friends and kins- folk; with what profound respect, with what deep sense of the honor conferred, wilt thou make thy bow of introduction' to the old prophets, and patri- archs, and all the other notabilities of the Holy City.-- But I dare not dwell upon anticipations so delightful, and so must bid thee adieu for awhile, with my humble, but most hearty God bless thee!   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.     241 I FEEL decidedly better this bright, beautiful autumnal day--such a day-too good for us poor invalids-we can't- enjoy it-how completely is such a treasure thrown away, too, on your men of busi- ness, your politicians, your sensualists-the poets and the painters, they can comprehend it, can ap- preciate it, can reproduce it with their glorious pens and pencils-yes, this day, doth it not live and glow, in all its brilliant beauty, in the matchless pictures of Cole, in the exquisite poems of Bryant? Alas, the artist's version must soon fade and moulder away, while the poet's will live for ever- will it not be so?-will not that matchless sonnet to October last so long as earth lasts, and its hours, and its seasons?-surely, surely it will. Let me read it again-if I can't enjoy the original as I would like, let me at least make the most of this beautiful copy-true, I have not health, strength, nerve, capacity enough, to hunt up and explore for myself all these hidden beauties and meanings in nature, but I can relish these charming descriptions; can avail myself of the labors of this gifted trans- lator, this wise and kindly interpreter; let me be thankful for such a privilege.

Did that man ever run? I doubt it; I doubt if the smartest shower that ever fell, could force him into a trot; you can't get rapid motion out of him; you can't fluster him, either, or discompose those'nerves of his, for the life of you; I don't believe the great day of reckoning itself could throw him into much of a flutter; and yet, how dare he take things so coolly? A man, at his time of life, a rational, accountable, sinful man, how dare he manifest such indifference about his spiritual welfare? A  man, too, who has such numerous and heavy creditors all over town, what right has he to amble along in this tranquil, pleasant sort of style? He looks, don't he, as if he was worrying himself about his sins, or his debts, either; as if he cared the toss of a farthing, how matters stood with him, either on the books of his brethren here below, or on those of the recording angel above? not he: oh, no, present comfort, present enjoyment, that's, his motto; he means to have an agreeable- day of it, come what will; he will, probably, spend -the morning cracking jokes, smoking his friends' segars, beating them at billiards; if his wine be well-iced at dinner, and in good condition,-what cares he whether it be paid for or not?

Joseph Surface ever did. But there it ends-the scamp-the scoundrel. And yet, I fear, I am not half so angry with him as a truly exemplary man would be; to say truth, I. fear I am, this minute, rather envying him his high health and his good spirits, than grieving over his delinquencies, or feeling any real alarm about his prospects hereafter. Ah, dear, this reminds me of my whimsical neighbor    , and of his queer views on this same subject of indebtedness. 'Twas only yesterday that I heard him air his feelings on this delicate point. I happened to run against him in the street; I saw at once that he was in a high state of excitement about something. I could not help asking him what the matter was.

Confound the fellow! I could see by the quiet grin with which he received the money, and counted it over, that he was having a hearty laugh within, at my expense. Yes, I feel quite angry with myself; I could almost blaspheme about it; I could kick the fellow with a righttgood will; I should like to see a dog flying at him, this moment, or a pugilist damaging his ugly frontispiece. Ah, this is wrong, is downright criminal in me; I know it-I confess it-still I feel so. And what aggravates the mat- ter, my dear fellow, I was ass enough to pay the man in gold, hard, glittering gold; yes, a whole score of bright, new half-eagles. Oh, how could I have been such a fool? Why not have waited a while, and then have discharged this cursed obli- gation by means of some old, ragged, filthy bank- note, with the signatures half eaten away. And if there had been a slight cloud of suspicion hanging over the credit of the institution, why, all the better-then, perhaps I might have felt   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.    245 differently; I might have been comparatively cheer- ful; as it is, I feel small, cheap, wretched."'- "But, my dear friend," said I, " tell me-was not the debt a fairly contracted one?" "Certainly," said he. "Were not the articles good?" "Excel- lent." "The prices reasonable?" "They were." "Have you not had, then, a fair substantial pro quo?' "I have." "Why then begrudge this worthy -man his quid? Why take the matter so to heart? You have but done your duty; but obeyed the authoritative voice of conscience; take comfort then-hold up your head-thump your breast- take a manly stride or two-appeal cheerfully and confidently to the mens conscia recti. How do you feel now? "Cheap as ever," he replied; "yes, it would be all folly and humbug for me to pretend that it were not so. Had I actually been doing wrong, I should not have felt half so bad.

Oh, am I the most depraved of my race, when I confess to you, that if I had squan- dered this very identical amount on a champagne frolic, or had I melted it--down into a bracelet for some silly girl, I should have been better satisfied; or had I given it to the cause of the widow and the orphan, or to some missionary enterprise, I might  &#xD;<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC8092-00000121"/> MUTTERINGS AND at least have derived comfort from the publication of the gift; as it is, you see how I feel.

Is not this a frightful state of things ? What-am I to do? Perhaps the perusal of some sound treatise on the law of debtor and creditor might do me good might compose me, might restore the balance of my mind. Have you such a work? If so, pray send it to me. Meanwhile, I'll hurry home, and see if a chapter or two from the good book may not be of benefit to me." And off he went; no doubt he recovered himself long before he got home; all he wanted was an opportunity of venting his whims.

What a pity, what a pity, that a poor fel- low should be afflicted in this way-that he should be the slave of such a terrible temper, of such   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.     255 abominable caprices-how  silly, how paltry it makes him appear. How many men, now, are there, infinitely inferior to him in all substantial qualities, that yet cut a vastly more respectable figure in the world, simply because they can hold the reins, while he cannot-men, too, who having little or no pepper in their own composition, can make no allowance for the frightful preponderance of it in his--phlegmatic, pharisaical wretches, they will even shake their heads, when they hear speak of him-will point him out in the streets to their children, as a terrible example-and yet, there is more real worth, more genuine sensibility in him, than in ten thousand such solemn humbugs. Hang them, when would they ever, (as I have known him do, more than once,) get up from their warm beds, to keep a poor drunken brother from freezing to death? catch them sitting up, night after night, with a sick, friendless stranger. But this man is perpetually doing such things--yes, this very man, who will fly into such fits of causeless wrath at times, who will rave so absurdly, who will make such a pitiful, and at the same time, ludicrous ex- hibition of himself, I have reason to know, has been playing the good Samaritan, in this way, almost every night for a month past.

Oh Lord, what strange inconsistencies in character one is seeing continually, in this inexplicable enigma of a world of ous. I dare say, the other man, who was the occasion of this sudden explosion of temper on 's part, is just such another' specimen as himself. I have no doubt, that if the two could be fairly brought together, and were to have five min- utes' talk and explaination of matters, it would end in their being fir' friends for the rest of their lives -but it is' altogether unlikely that any such eclair- cissement will ever occur. i It seems fated that most of us should go through the"world without under- standing each other-and so, these men, who ought to be playing Damon and Pythias, this very mo- ment, will, in all human probability, keep up this Same scowling and growling in the street, so long as their powers of locomotion last.

I did not, 'to be Sure, make a phenomenon of myself, in public, as he did, but I disgraced myself   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.   at home-and all for what? simply, because my tailor disappointed me. Did I not, shame on me, consign his eyes to the lowest pit?, Did I not, mentally, discharge at his head an incalculable amount of stones, glass, crockery, boots, boot-jacks, filth of all sorts ? Did I not wish him all manner of disasters, by flood and field ? a martyr to corns, a victim to pickpockets, a receiver of bad money, left behind by steamboats, his luggage for ever going one way and he the other, caught in perpetual showers, an eternal sipper of cold coffee and sour claret? Yes, every contemptible wish that could enter into the head of a peevish, whimsical, irrita- ble wretch. Such is this beautiful temper of mine, heightened and embellished, no doubt, by being united to such a lovely, vigorous frame as I have the honor of lugging about the earth. It will never be any better, I fear. I see nothing but fuss, scolding, tumult ahead-weak and wrong as it is, to give way so, still, things don't seem to mend with me-I shall keep it up in this style to the last.

'Twas my destiny, to-day, to sit opposite that horrible old glutton   , at dinner. Heavens, what an exhibition he made of himself-with what rapidity, energy, inflexibility of purpose, with what awfully destructive results, did he play his part- as to not looking at him, that was quite out of the question. I was completely fascinated, spell-bound^ by the terrific performance. And to think, that at the end of it all, the old wretch should complain of not having his usual appetite. I thought I should -have choked, in the vain attempt to keep my ciuntenance. For more than half a century, now, has this furious trencherman been waging this deso- lating war against the good things of the earth.

And still is the old warrior as eager for the fray as ever-still doth that capa- cious, that insatiate maw cry out with the horse- leech, give, give, give-still do those faithful grind- ers ply their ceaseless task. "So was it, when he was a child. So is it, now he is a man." So will it be, till the great Prince of Gluttons shall pounce upon his victim; when, by the great law of retri- butive justice, " this desolator desolate, this victor overthrown," shall himself become a dish. Ah, if this man were to serve his country with one-half the fidelity and zeal that he doth his stomach, what a model patriot our happy land might boast of-or were he to make kindred sacrifices upon the altar of his faith, what a second Luther we should have amongst us to startle and reform this wicked age. Faith, forsooth! the market-place contains the arti- cles of this man's faith; the table is h/s solemn tem- ple; the bill of fare his ritual, and he the most single-minded, the most devout of worshippers.

What tones of truth or wisdom can penetrate those thick walls of sense? What, save the liberating hand of death, can ever let in the glorious light of day upon that unhappy captive?

' Don't be alarmed about that; I'll see that a good seat is secured for you. Go you must; you never heard such singing. There never was, there never will be anything like it, this side Heaven." And so he went on. He is always in the same gale of excite- ment; 'twas so when Ole Bull was here. I remem- ber going with him to one or two of his concerts.

If he had had as many as-Briareus, 'twould have been all the same; the wholefifty pair would have been going together, with the same vehement energy. Gabriel Ravel was another of his weaknesses. He seemed to get perfectly beside himself with laughter and wonder at the jokes and the feats of that prince of fun, that amazing Acrobat.

'tis delightful to see such heartiness, such enthusiasm. It must be confessed, though, that it is not always expended upon scenes or artists that have such a legitimate claim upon it as the above; my friend's judgment is by no means so good as his heart; oh, no; he has made some terrible mistakes in his day. His love of novelty, his hankering after new sources of excitement, have played the mischief with him, at times; he certainly has been severely bitten by some most atrocious humbugs.   What a dance mesmerism led him, for instance; how many trashy books has he bought, how many gatherings has he attended, how many vile impostors have had him by the button, in connection with this subject, for the last five years; all that time has he been on the lookout for amazing developments, as he calls them, for astounding spiritual discoveries; they have not come along yet-they never will come; he himself begins at last to think so, begins to feel that the whole thing is essentially a swindle-- not an unmitigated swindle, perhaps; no doubt, in  &#xD;<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC8092-00000130"/> 264      MUTTERINGS AND all-this chasing after wonders, this hunting after miir- acles, some valuable facts have been laid hold of, some few precious grains of truth have been added to the Treasury of Knowledge; still, who is not con- vinced that the whole 'system, as now paraded before the world, is substantially a humbug, found- ed in fraud, kept up by impudence, nourished by credulity?

But oh, how much more potent and triumphant is the voice of Christianity on this: subject!"What, they of no account in his eyes,-;to -whom- God has given, not only so many good things, and; noble faculties, but so many special messengers also, fraught with glad tidings and- solemn .warnings and precious prom- ises?-nay,; who: hath: himself come down from Heaven-- to visit and: enlighten and redeem them?" Happy- the man, who can ask this question in good   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.     2-9 faith-who is not shamming in this matter, who is not merely acquiescing in these truths, but in his very heart and soul adopts them, and manfully acts up to them. If these things be so, indeed, what a delightful position he occupies; if they should turn out to be an illusion, still what a charming, glorious. illusion-an illusion that tends alike to cheer the heart and mend the life, to make a man a blessing to those about him, an ornament to his race, who wouldn't cherish it? But, to' look at this matter again, as a poor natural man, is there, after all, in the phenomena which Science discloses or suggests, anything to force us to take such frightfully humble ground, and to make us, out such a contemptible portion of creation? If mere bulk, indeed, is to be the measure of value, our little planet must certainly cut a pretty sorry figure in the skies, alongside of its unwieldy brethren Jupiter and Saturn, for instance. But may we not have the advantage of them both, in matters of far more consequence:? As in the earth itself, there are favored tracts, alike removed from the heat of the equator and the polar - cold, in which alone are to be found the highest mani- festations of beauty, the-rarest exhibitions of intel- lect, may it not be the same thing in the system? may: we not have-a iar more felicitous positio Xiii  &#xD;<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC8092-00000138"/> z-280      MUTTERINGS AND ,that system, for- the development of physical and intellectual excellence, than either the inhabitants of Mars or Venus, or than those of the greater and more distant planets? may not our little orb, after all, then,. be, far more precious in the eyes of its Maker than its huge brethren? may not our little- selves, with all our crimes and follies, be far nobler pro- ducts of Divine Wisdom, than their inhabitants-a race, for aught we know, of clumsy, feeble-witted, malignant giants? Why not take comfort in that thought, as well as be cowed down by the oppo- site? May not conjecture, poor, wandering child of ignorance, be allowed to stray in one direction as well as another? But, after all, why indulge at all in 'such vain and -unprofitable conjectures? Are they not quite too much, even for the strongest nerves, the clearest heads, the purest hearts? What right, then, have I, poor, frail, feeble, ignorant sinner that I am, to try to fathom these awful depths, to puzzle my poor brains with these bewil- dering speculations?. Better, far better, confine myself to the humble sphere of duty assigned me, to do all I can, in my small way, towards making W this earth of ours, or at least the little corner of it in which I am called to act, more worthy of the Great Founder---more comfortable, and beautiful,   MUSINGS OF AN INVALID.      281 and enlightened, and happy--the home of peace and good will-and to leave it, at last, not in a murmuring, struggling, rebellious spirit, but calmly and hopefully awaiting the great mysteries of the future.- "Hope humbly, then, on trembling pinions soar, Wait the great teacher Death, and God adore."    &#xD;</p>
