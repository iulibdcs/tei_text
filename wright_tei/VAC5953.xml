                  <p>A BRILLIANT and happy family party lingered for a few minutes before departing
                     on their morning's ride, to enjoy the beautiful scene that presented itself to
                     their view from the high ground beyond the main terrace, at "Sunnyside," near
                     the town of Hamble, England—on a fine October day.</p>
                  <p>The grooms and the outriders were at the foot of the stairs, with the large,
                     open landau, the phaeton and the ready-saddled horses, awaiting the coming of
                     the family and the guests who were about to enjoy a drive through the extended
                     park of the owner of "Sunnyside;" and the high bred animals were champing their
                     bits uneasily, as if anxious to get away upon the smooth hard roads they were
                     so well accustomed to. There was a pretty white palfrey there, too, for the use
                     of one of the young ladies, a shaggy-maned Shetland for the son, and a brace of
                     large French spaniels frolicked near the steps, delighted with the prospect
                     before them, in being permitted to accompany the expedition.</p>
                  <p>"<hi rend="i"/>Sunnyside" was an magnificent old English estate, located three
                     or four miles above the village of Hamble, and a diminutive river bearing the
                     same name (and flowing into the Southampton), runs by it. The lands to the left
                     of this stream, and lying to the northward, are picturesque and rich in all the
                     variety of forest, hill and vale, for which Great Britain, in many locations is
                     famous. Deep and expansive oakf orests, broad fields, sloping hills, and gentle
                     valleys vary the scene for miles above the water; and here, upon the southerly
                     side of a finely wooded mountain, stood the spacious mansion of the broad
                     estate to which we would invite the temporary notice of the reader.</p>
                  <p>The main building was in the style of Elizabethean architecture, and the
                     gardens, lawns, walks and drives were of the most liberal character. The
                     terraces were broad and high, too, with heavy marble balustrades around them;
                     the porter's lodge and gardeners' cottages, the steward's dwelling and
                     gamekeeper's house—the stables, and grapehouses, and conservatories, etc., all
                     were ample and conspicuously disposed—and the proprietor of this noble domain
                     was rich to his heart's content.</p>
                  <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC5953-00000004"/>
                  <p>The present party consisted of Mr. Maitland, senior, his young son and
                     daughter, Mrs. Maitland, and two or three ladies and gentlemen from Bristol—who
                     had come down to pass a few days with the Maitlands, at "Sunnyside."</p>
                  <p>There was one young gentleman, among the guests, to whom we may here devote a
                     paragraph, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">en passant;</foreign> a handsome youth of
                     twenty-one, who had latterly been promoted by special favor of the lords of the
                     admiralty from a passed midshipman to lieutenant, and had been detailed to the
                     command of a revenue cutter, temporarily, then stationed on the coast. George
                     Hargreve was a brave fellow, and had proved himself worthy the place he now
                     filled. He was on leave of absence for a week, and intended to make the most of
                     his time. His own family were highly respectable people, and he had been as
                     carefully educated, and as well controlled, as the best of the young men who
                     had been similarly situated, thus far in life. He was a splendid horseman, a
                     capital shot, of ardent disposition, extremely fond of society, and was known
                     in every way as a daring, intrepid "good fellow," by all who had the pleasure
                     of his association and acquaintance.</p>
                  <p>The company left the broad sloping lawn that run down a long distance in front
                     of the mansion, to the great terrace, and the horses were instantly wheeled to
                     the steps. The morning was beautiful, the air crisp and cool, and the party
                     were in excellent spirits. A portion of the guests entered the landau with Mr.
                     and Mrs. Maitland, a pretty girl of fifteen was handed into the palfrey's
                     saddle, the son of Maitland took his seat on the pony, and young Hargreve
                     mounted a superb saddle-horse, in companionship with another couple of the
                     guests. A brace of attendants, also on horseback, brought up the rear, and the
                     party dashed away in high glee on their excursion.</p>
                  <p>The roads and avenues running around and through the great park, were lined
                     with ornamental shade trees of various kinds, the wide plains and valleys were
                     studded with clumps of shrubbery and evergreens that grew naturally upon the
                     estate, or were arranged by the hand of taste, delightful streams meandered
                     softly through the valleys, and numerous ponds, natural or artificial, were
                     scattered about the immense domain.</p>
                  <p>There were miles and miles of drives and walks in every direction. Groves and
                     forests of wood appeared in appropriate contrast, from point to point. And our
                     party galloped along the paths at an easy pace, enjoying to the full the bright
                     scenes before them—on their right and on their left.</p>
                  <p>The proprietor of "Sunnyside" was a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">bon
                        vivant,</foreign> but he was rational in his enjoyment of life. The master
                     of a magnificent private fortune, he expended it liberally, but judiciously;
                     and his tenantry all knew and loved him. He lived not entirely for himself, but
                     could enjoy his good fortune only in seeing everybody happy around him—whether
                     they were his dependants or his guests. "Sunnyside" was thus the resort of
                     scores of true-hearted friends, who were ready always to reciprocate the
                     hospitality that the Maitlands were so proverbially profuse in, and which gave
                     them the ascendancy in popular favor in the region where they had so long
                     resided.</p>
                  <p>After an hour's absence the party returned once more to the stairs of the
                     terrace, where the horses were taken charge of by the grooms, and the ladies
                     and gentlemen proceeded to the gardens.</p>
                  <p>Here were arrayed in exquisite good taste numerous statues and vases of marble.
                     Fountains of water, conducted to the spot from the lake at the hillside,
                     sparkled and sprayed on every hand. The rarest plants and shrubs were arranged
                     about in glorious profusion, and the soft air was burthened with rich perfumes
                     from the beautiful buds and flowers that graced the neatly kept parterres.</p>
                  <p>Young Hargreve enjoyed this scene with intense pleasure. It was a change from
                     the dull routine, comparatively, to which he was obliged to submit on
                     ship-board; and as he loitered along in the rear of the ladies, he found
                     himself suddenly at Mr. Maitland's side. They sauntered slowly along up the
                     main avenue toward the house, and Maitland entered into easy conversation with
                     him.</p>
                  <p>"Well, Hargreve, my boy," he said, "I congratulate you on your late
                     promotion."</p>
                  <p>"Thank you, sir, thank you."</p>
                  <p>"You will stick to your profession, I suppose?"</p>
                  <p>"For the present, sir."</p>
                  <p>"And for the future, too—why not?"</p>
                  <p>"That will depend entirely upon circumstances. If such an opportunity should
                     present, by-and-by, as I could name, perhaps, I should not permit it to pass
                     me."</p>
                  <p>"And what might that be like, for instance?" continued Mr. Maitland, still
                     probing the young man, as if he meant more than mere passing curiosity in his
                     questioning.</p>
                  <p>"Really; I can't say, precisely. But a change from—"</p>
                  <p>"A rover, eh?"</p>
                  <p>"No—not exactly that; because I am now in very respectable employment, you
                     know, with good pay, in the service. But, if certain chances were to turn up,
                     whereby fortune might be bettered, in a briefer space of time than could be
                     anticipated amid the duties of an ordinary officer in his majesty's navy, you
                     know, I should not hesitate to embrace it, I think."</p>
                  <p>"And throw up your commission?"</p>
                  <p>"That would follow, of course."</p>
                  <p>"A certainty for an uncertainty?"</p>
                  <p>"Not exactly so. Rathera poor certainty for a probable improvement in
                     fortune."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I see," replied Maitland, as they turned towards the verandah of the
                     mansion, where the ladies had already arrived.</p>
                  <p>The old gentleman had taken a fancy to George Hargreve, though the latter was
                     not aware of the fact. He supposed that Mr. Maitland had his reasons for
                     questioning him as he did, or perhaps he did it merely for talk, and to pass
                     away the time as they moved homeward.</p>
                  <p>But the liberal-minded Mr. Maitland rarely talked so much without a cause,
                     present or remote. And we shall see anon, what came of this little
                     dialogue.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE REVENUE CUTTER.</head>
                  <p>THERE lay at anchor, at this time, off the edge of the coast, below
                     Southampton, a small government sloop attached to the revenue service—a pretty
                     and well-built craft, of which, under his new commission, young Hargreve was
                     acting commander. There had been considerable smuggling of French and Spanish
                     goods into the south of England, within the past few months, and the orders
                     from the secretary to Lieutenant Hargreve, accompanying his official transfer
                     to the command of the Arrow, had been unusually urgent and explicit in
                     reference to his new duties.</p>
                  <p>After his brief visit at Sunnyside, whither he had gone in response to a
                     special invite from Mr. Maitland, who had been his father's early friend, he
                     repaired to his vessel, and took formal charge of her.</p>
                  <p>"When you make up your mind to exchange your present occupation for any other,
                     George," said the good Mr. Maitland to him, as he was taking leave, "let me
                     know it. I may be of service to you, you know."</p>
                  <p>"You are very kind, sir. I don't know that I shall venture to trouble you,"
                     responded Hargreve. "My father, as you are aware, has unfortunately become
                     involved, by means of the obligations he has assumed for some of his friends,
                     and he has been compelled to trammel his property, to pay his endorsements and
                     the bonds he has signed for those who have been unable at present to meet their
                     promises."</p>
                  <p>"I had heard of this," said Maitland.</p>
                  <p>"In my present situation, it is out of my power to aid him much. But I shall
                     keep an eye to windward, and something may fall in my way, by-and-by, whereby I
                     shall be able to help him, I hope. He has been a kind and indulgent parent,
                     sir, and it is a hard thing indeed, in the autumn of his years, that he is thus
                     pecuniarily jeopardized."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Maitland was pleased with this spirit, on the part of young Hargreve, but
                     he merely added:</p>
                  <p>"I appreciate your motives, George. When you are ready to make any change,
                     remember, I shall desire to know of your intentions. Adieu."</p>
                  <p>Among the pests that had annoyed the officers upon this station, and who up to
                     this time the government deputies had been unable to arrest, was one Barnabas
                     Heath, a runaway Scotch man, who was a notorious smuggler, and who commanded an
                     old French lugger plying between the Portuguese coast and the waters of
                     Southampton and neighborhood.</p>
                  <p>Barnabas—or "Barney" Heath as he was called—was a dare-devil fellow, of robust
                     proportions, considerable skill, a good deal of tact, and of thriving
                     disposition. He would run his lugger in shore at all times, in all weather, in
                     safety, and hundreds of kegs and barrels of brandies and wines had been landed
                     from his vessel, upon which no penny of revenue had ever been collected. As
                     soon as Lieutenant Hargreve took possession of the Arrow, upon information
                     lodged with him of the existence of this imposition, he forthwith determined to
                     capture Barney and his crew, and break up this nefarious occupation, so far at
                     least as the swarthy and impudent Scotchman was concerned.</p>
                  <p>"You will hardly find this so easy a matter to accomplish," said the gunner of
                     the Arrow, "as it may seem to you, captain."</p>
                  <p>"And why not, Brace?"</p>
                  <p>"I've been on this coast now fifteen years. Old Barney has been driving his
                     contraband trade here, for the last seven or eight years, and we've kept a
                     sharp lookout on him constantly; but we've never yet got a lick at him."</p>
                  <p>"How does he manage it all?"</p>
                  <p>"That's just exactly what we'd all like to know, captain!" exclaimed Brace. "He
                     comes and goes, his papers are always ready when we've asked him questions or
                     boarded him on suspicion, and he's uniformly contrived, in one way or another,
                     to get clear of conviction. Once only (a year ago or more), we found a dozen
                     kegs of brandy aboard him, that he couldn't account for at first. But he made a
                     post-entry for it, slavered the officials over, swore he knew nothing of it,
                     and they permitted him to add the liquor to his manifest, and go clear again.
                     Since chat time, he's been saucier than ever, and has made a nice little
                     fortune out of it."</p>
                  <p>"They should have nabbed him, <emph>then,</emph> and saved further
                     trouble."</p>
                  <p>"That would have been the better way, I think; but he managed his affair so
                     adroitly that he was able to snap his fingers at 'em afterwards."</p>
                  <p>"What is his vessel, Brace?"</p>
                  <p>"She was a scheoner originally, I believe; but they put an extra mast into her,
                     some years ago, and she is now a crazy looking lugger—though she draws but a
                     han' full of water, and sails like a witch before the wind."</p>
                  <p>"Has she been seen of late in our waters, about here?"</p>
                  <p>"There she lays, captain, now!" said Brace, passing the lieutenant a glass.
                     "High an' dry, among the seaweed."</p>
                  <p>"How long has she been there?"</p>
                  <p>"I don't know. You see the light blue streak below her gun'ale, don't you? And
                     the blue figure-head?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, yes. That is a queer style of adorn ment, verily. What is her name?"
                     asked young Hargreve.</p>
                  <p>"The <hi rend="i"/>Blue Wing he calls her."</p>
                  <p>"And where does she hail from, Brace?"</p>
                  <p>"Brittany, in France."</p>
                  <p>"Keep your eye on her, then. When she goes out of harbor again, we will see
                     that she doesn't return with a cargo that we can't inspect, at any rate. Send
                     Mr. Morely here."</p>
                  <p>The boatswain of the Arrow immediately presented himself to the commander.</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Morely," said Hargreve, "I am desirous of urging a little more activity
                     among the men, than it appears to me has been customary with them on this
                     station. Complaints of long standing exist against this region of waters, and
                     the government are continually being defrauded of revenue, by the smugglers
                     here. This is all scandalous, and we must see to it. Especially, have your eyes
                     open to the course of this Barney Heath, of whom I hear a good deal."</p>
                  <p>"Of the <hi rend="i"/>Blue Wing, captain?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes."</p>
                  <p>"Then we have done that same for five years, an' we've made nothing by it
                     yet!"</p>
                  <p>"So much the more need of increased vigilance."</p>
                  <p>"He's a cunning 'un, is Barney, though."</p>
                  <p>"And you all appear to agree that he is a notorious contrabandist?"</p>
                  <p>"We can't miss of saying that, captain. But he is not readily trapped, you may
                     believe."</p>
                  <p>"Watch the Blue Wing on her return into port again. She is now lying abreast of
                     the castle yonder, and will soon go out, probably. When she returns, I want to
                     know it."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir," said the boatswain, touching his hat, respectfully and
                     retiring.</p>
                  <p>As Morely moved forward, he muttered to himself:</p>
                  <p>"It's all very well. New brooms swaip clain! Old Barney Heath will give him a
                     sweat, or my name arn't Tom Morely. And he thinks <emph>he</emph> can catch
                     him! Aha! I wish he may be so lucky. An' if he does, he'll have a Tartar, any
                     way; or I'm not an Irishman, at all!"</p>
                  <p>When the watch was set, Morely did not fail to repeat the caution and wishes of
                     their new commander. The old salts smiled at his earnestness and shook their
                     heads.</p>
                  <p>"He's too smart for 'em," ventured one.</p>
                  <p>"Ay," responded another, "he'll run his infernal old hulk into the space of a
                     gun-barrel, before<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC5953-00000006"/> fore a nor wester,
                     and snap his fingers at us in the pursuit."</p>
                  <p>"Ay," continued a third man," and when we get afoul of 'im, he hain't nothing
                     aboard except a few old biscuits and a jug o' poor grog, to be seen from locker
                     to forecas'le! Ha, ha—Barney <emph>is</emph> a rum 'un, to be sure. Catch
                        <emph>him?</emph> Barney never naps it, do you mind. He's a marine weasel,
                     is Barney; an' the man as nabs <emph>him</emph> mustn't sleep much o'nights,
                     eh?"</p>
                  <p>The universal conclusion was that the Blue Wing was a peculiarly ugly customer,
                     in her way, and that she would continue to enjoy her freedom for the present,
                     for aught that the newly appointed lieutenant could do to prevent it.</p>
                  <p>The next morning when Brace came on deck, he immediately turned the glass
                     shoreward. It was thick and foggy from the mist that had begun to rise at
                     midnight. As soon as the sun rose and the breeze lifted the fog-banks near the
                     shore, a clear view could be had.</p>
                  <p>The Blue Wing was nowhere in sight!</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                  <head type="sub">BARNEY AND HIS LUGGER.</head>
                  <p>BARNEY HEATH had been ready to depart for several hours, but the proximity of
                     the Arrow to his moorings, and the supposition that she might be watching his
                     movements, induced him to "lie low" upon the flats till evening, or later.</p>
                  <p>"Keep a sharp lookout for the smoke, Maurice," said the hardy Barney. "We shall
                     have it afore eight bells—and call me as soon as it heaves up."</p>
                  <p>"Ay, ay, sir."</p>
                  <p>"We'll be off at midnight, and I'll turn in for an hour or two."</p>
                  <p>Barney knew by the "twist in the wind," as he called it, at nightfall, that the
                     fog would rise before early morning; and as he knew every square foot of the
                     coast for ten leagues above and below where he lay, he also knew exactly how to
                     get away, whether the stars helped him out or not. He went below, for a nap,
                     and the deck watch was duly expected to summon him agreeably to his directions,
                     which were perfectly well understood.</p>
                  <p>At one o'clock in the morning, Maurice stepped lightly into the cabin, and
                     warned Barney that the mist was rapidly rising.</p>
                  <p>"Call all hands, Maurice, and stand ready. How is the wind?"</p>
                  <p>"We have a cap-full from the north-east'ard, but the smoke is as thick as a
                     Stilton cheese, cap'n."</p>
                  <p>"Bear-a-hand, then. I will be up directly."</p>
                  <p>Maurice disappeared, and the captain soon followed him to the low and begrimmed
                     deck of the lugger.</p>
                  <p>Barney Heath was a resolute and defiant man. He cared very little for danger,
                     and was reckless of his own safety, or that of his men, when pressed for time,
                     or while occupied in the performance of his precarious business. He had been
                     thoroughly schooled in his unlawful trade, he had now served a good many years
                     in it—either in his present <foreign xml:lang="FRA">locale,</foreign> or at
                     other points, and few men knew the waters of the British Channel, whether upon
                     the west or the east, so well as did this brave and adventurous fellow. But his
                     avocation was illegal, and he was obliged to take his daily chance with the
                     harbor police and the government officials, for the opportunity of carrying on
                     his traffic.</p>
                  <p>Yet it paid him well. At this period the duties upon French and Portuguese
                     liquors were very high in England, and when he landed his cargo safely, he
                     could count upon a large profit, surely and constantly. Inured to all kinds of
                     weather, and rather fond of the excitement and the hardships of his calling, he
                     rarely thought of the perils he incurred, and only looked to fortune "once
                     more," from trip to trip, to urge him on to new dangers and fresh risks. In the
                     present instance, he had undertaken to accomplish a more than ordinary
                     venturesome enterprise, upon which depended important results to all the
                     parties concerned; but which he engaged to guarantee, as usual.</p>
                  <p>He had become emboldened by his hitherto extraordinary good run of luck. Like
                     the gamester who plays high, and wins for a time, and who follows up his
                     hallucination and "doubles"<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC5953-00000007"/> on his
                     hand, to lose his last guinea at the "one fell swoop" that succeeds, so the
                     smuggler had played with fortune, and won in his minor attempts.
                        <emph>His</emph> final game was yet to come!</p>
                  <p>But Barney Heath know nothing of this, and he really cared less. He used to
                     sing: <q>
                        <lg type="quotation">
                           <l>"Life is a shadow, Its comforts are few,</l>
                           <l rend="ti-1">Its perils are met by the score!</l>
                           <l>Amidst all, we are certain to find something new,</l>
                           <l rend="ti-1">Night or day—on the wave—or on shore;</l>
                           <l rend="ti-2">So let us be merry, boys—</l>
                           <l rend="ti-2">But constantly wary—boys!</l>
                           <l rend="ti-1">And let our `round turn' come when it will."</l>
                        </lg>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>As soon as he reached the deck and saw the thick fog-banks that enveloped sea
                     and land around him, he hailed for Maurice.</p>
                  <p>"Ay, ay, sir," responded that worthy, who never slept when there was any work
                     to be done.</p>
                  <p>"This is beautiful," continued Barney.</p>
                  <p>"Thick enough, captain, at all events."</p>
                  <p>"How's the tide?"</p>
                  <p>"Just at the top-flood, and turning."</p>
                  <p>"Excellent! Get up the anchor, quietly now crack on all sail, put her nose
                     strait to the southward, and set the little cutter yonder to wondering, at
                     daybreak, eh?"</p>
                  <p>"Capital!" responded Maurice, who loved this sort of thing quite as well as his
                     betters.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly, without any unnecessary stir, the anchor was weighed an hour after
                     midnight, and the lugger quickly put out to sea upon the top of the receding
                     tide.</p>
                  <p>Whither she was bound, or when she would return again—if at all—no one on board
                     knew, save her captain. As the crew were perfectly contented and happy, and as
                     they knew if they asked questions, they could ascertain nothing of Barney's
                     plans, save what he voluntarily vouchsafed them—they said nothing, but obeyed
                     orders as fast as they were given. At daylight, they were a dozen leagues at
                     sea, on their course towards the coast of southern France.</p>
                  <p>When Lieutenant Hargreve made his appearance on the deck of the Arrow next
                     morning, at a little past seven bells, he took the glass and turned it towards
                     the spot where the Blue Wing had been moored the afternoon before. He did not
                     see her at first—and so he lowered it—then turned it above and below the point
                     where she had been anchored. The tide was out, and so was the lugger!</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Brace!" he shouted, rather tartly.</p>
                  <p>"Ay, ay, sir!"</p>
                  <p>"Where is the lugger?"</p>
                  <p>"I don't know, sir," said Brace.</p>
                  <p>"Don't know! She isn't on the flats, there?"</p>
                  <p>"No, sir."</p>
                  <p>"Then she is gone again!"</p>
                  <p>"So I should think, sir."</p>
                  <p>"Very likely! You think if she isn't here, she is somewhere else, eh?"</p>
                  <p>"That would be a nat'ral conclusion, sir," said Brace, touching his cap.</p>
                  <p>"What does it mean? Why are not her movements duly reported, as I ordered
                     yesterday?"</p>
                  <p>"Well, sir, we had a fog during the night, so dense that you couldn't see
                     anything five fathoms distant from the cutter's head if we had had to swing
                     from the yard-arm for it."</p>
                  <p>"Fog?" exclaimed Hargreve, looking up at the clear horizon suspiciously.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir—a reg'lar winding sheet. Enveloped in which, the Blue Wing took
                     French leave."</p>
                  <p>"This is too bad, altogether."</p>
                  <p>"Her papers must have been all right—"</p>
                  <p>"Yes—but that wouldn't have prevented our watching her, surely."</p>
                  <p>"No, sir, but the fog <emph>did;</emph> and in the midst of it, the lugger has
                     moved out of our reach for the present."</p>
                  <p>"Very well—it can't be helped. My plans must be changed. See to it, when she
                     returns and we will not suffer her to give us the slip again in this way."</p>
                  <p>Mr. Brace left the quarter-deck with an ominous shake of the head, which his
                     captain did not seem to observe.</p>
                  <p>In accordance with his general orders, on the following morning the Arrow set
                     out on a cruise up and down the coast. She was absent off and on some five or
                     six days; during which time she had never got sight of the lugger, or heard of
                     her in any way.</p>
                  <p>Meantime, Barney was busy at Bayonne. After a fortnight's absence, having
                     shipped a valuable cargo of brandy, in small kegs that could be readily
                     handled, he set sail for the English coast once more, where he had arranged to
                     land it, as usual, without paying tithe or tax for the privilege!</p>
                  <p>The cutter sailed again, and proceeded down the channel. She was gone a week,
                     and returned late in the evening and came to anchor off Southampton once
                     more.</p>
                  <p>When daylight broke, one of the first objects that presented itself to the eyes
                     of Hargreve and his crew, was the Blue Wing, lying quietly at anchor half a
                     mile to leeward, near the shore!</p>
               </div>
               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
                  <head type="sub">A TRIUMPH FOR GEORGE HARGREVE.</head>
                  <p>THE young commander of the Arrow was a good deal annoyed at the continued
                     success of the smuggler, and he was the more chagrined to see, what was pretty
                     plain to himself and his associates, namely, that, during his absence, the Blue
                     Wing had returned stealthily, and had undoubtedly accomplished another landing
                     of contraband goods in the interim.</p>
                  <p>To be sure there was no ocular proof of this, and the lugger now lay at her
                     anchorage as quietly and apparently as innocent of the commission of any such
                     offence, as any other craft that could be found in the stream there!
                     Nevertheless, the fact was not doubted by the crew of the cutter, or of the
                     shore people, who had had ample experience with old Barney in this business. At
                     that time the "right of search" was not recognized between the two governments;
                     and as the lugger sailed under French colors, Hargreve disliked to be too hasty
                     in his conclusions or his actions, which, under the existing circumstances,
                     involved a degree of extra responsibility.</p>
                  <p>The Blue Wing had not made port so soon on the previous night as Barney had
                     intended, by three hours; and the consequence was that but half of his cargo
                     had been landed under cover of the darkness. It was now necessary for him to
                     haul down stream quietly—which he intended to do, as soon as the tide
                     served—and then to put out to sea again; for if he were now boarded, at least
                     two hundred kegs of choice French brandy would be found in the lugger's hold,
                     for which he could not conveniently account. Hargreve had no knowledge of this,
                     of course, and he could only watch her and trust to further developments.</p>
                  <p>At about ten o'clock, as the tide was rapidly running out, Barney suddenly
                     slipped his cable and allowed the lugger to float down the stream. As he lay
                     upwards of half a mile below the Arrow, he had got well down with the tide
                     before any questions were asked—when Lieutenant Hargreve lowered away his boat,
                     and sent to inquire what was going on.</p>
                  <p>He received for answer that her old cable had snapped off, from the pressure of
                     the receding tide, and it was evident that they were getting ready on board the
                     lugger to drop another anchor as rapidly as possible. This, by some means
                     (which Barney understood perfectly well, but which Hargreve's men did not) had
                     got foul forward; and while the men were busy in getting the chains clear, the
                     lugger was making rapid progress to leeward. The men returned to the cutter
                     with this report, but it did not satisfy Hargreve at all.</p>
                  <p>"I don't believe the statement, Mr. Brace. If it be so, there is no harm in
                     watching her. I think it is only a ruse to get out of our reach."</p>
                  <p>"I am quite sure she will come to anchor immediately<pb n="16-17"
                        xml:id="VAC5953-00000008"/> mediately," said Brace, respectfully. "This is
                     not like old Barney at all. If he wanted to sail he would have put out at once
                     and risked it. Besides, I don't imagine that he has the slightest suspicion
                     that he is particularly watched, sir."</p>
                  <p>Hargreve stood with the glass in his hand, and Barney on board the lugger at
                     the same moment was doing the same thing.</p>
                  <p>"Why don't she come to anchor, Brace?" asked the commander of the Arrow,
                     nervously, as he saw the lugger still floating away to leeward.</p>
                  <p>"I can't say, sir."</p>
                  <p>"What are they doing <emph>now,</emph> then?" exclaimed Hargreve, in the next
                     breath, as he discovered the lugger's sudden movements. "By Jove! It's just
                     what I expected. Call all hands, Mr. Brace, and weigh anchor, instantly. Do you
                     see?"</p>
                  <p>"Bear-a-hand, now! Call Mr. Morely."</p>
                  <p>"Look to the rigging, lively, boys!" shouted the second officer. "Heave home,
                     heave home! Up with the jib, forward, there! Now the fore-sail—sheet home!" and
                     the cutter was almost instantly away before the wind.</p>
                  <p>Barney Heath had calculated to a nicety. He had floated down until he was fully
                     two miles distant from the Arrow, before he permitted any demonstration to be
                     made. The wind was blowing fresh from the southeast. As soon as he found
                     himself beyond what he believed to be the danger of being overhauled before he
                     was ready, in case the Arrow should now follow him—he set all sail with the
                     utmost despatch, and flew away before the breeze at a rate that astonished even
                     Hargreve himself!</p>
                  <p>"Now, boys," said Barney, "look to your posts, and see all snug and taut
                     aboard. The new-comer on board the Arrow snuffs us plainly. He can't have this
                     brandy, you know, of course; but we've got to run for it. Look! He's after us!
                     Just as I feared. Now, crack on all sail. The wind is improving. Perhaps he'll
                     catch us, maybe <emph>not,</emph> though!" continued the Scotchman, who was
                     very well acquainted with the sailing qualities of both vessels. "It was an
                     unlucky job, that," he added, referring to the delay to which he found himself
                     compelled to submit, on the previous night. "Hows'ever, we'll get clear of him
                     in a few hours on this wind. We can outsail him, unless," continued Barney,
                     suddenly, "he should put away to windward of us. Egad! that's just what he's
                     doing, to be sure!"</p>
                  <p>The order had been given aboard the cutter, to keep outside, and follow the
                     lugger down the coast, keeping him in sight, and in order to prevent his
                     getting out to sea; as the crew of the Arrow knew very well that it was not an
                     even chance for them, if the Blue Wing had sea room. It was not to the purpose
                     of Hargreve to suffer Barney to suspect his intentions. He therefore took care
                     to keep away from pursuing him, apparently, while, at the same time, he
                     determined he should not put out into the channel.</p>
                  <p>But Barney Heath was too old a salt to be deceived in this manner. He therefore
                     crowded all sail, kept a steady eye on the movements of the cutter, manœuvered,
                     from time to time, so as to deceive Hargreve as much as possible, and kept on
                     down the coast, below Weymouth, on toward the creeks inside of Portland
                     Bill—where he knew the shoals a good deal better than did young Hargreve, and
                     reaching which, he felt certain that he could run into shallow water, and
                     eventually land his cargo without the consent or knowledge of the government
                     officials.</p>
                  <p>Whether it was owing to the superior skill of the new commander of the Arrow,
                     whether it was because she had a better chance on the wind a little farther out
                     from the land (in the course she had chosen), or whether the Blue Wing didn't
                     sail so well as was her wont, Barney Heath swore he couldn't decide. But one
                     thing was certain, and it greatly surprised him—judging from previous
                     experience—and that was the fact that, do his best, he could not gain a yard in
                     the now clearly apparent chase!</p>
                  <p>In vain he spread his extra canvass, in vain he yelled and stamped and chafed;
                     the Arrow still held her own, and he saw that it was determined he should keep
                     in shore, at least. Later in the day, the Arrow actually gained on him! And
                     finally, coming down in his wake, a shot from the cutter was a very emphatic
                     hint for the lugger to heave-to. But Barney did not appreciate any such summons
                     as this; and veering up a point nearer the wind, he did his best to escape.</p>
                  <p>Towards night the breeze freshened, but it served the Arrow most favorably. The
                     cloud of sail which the lugger had crowded on, had strained her ricketty
                     foremast, and she began to labor badly in the gale. The cutter still came on,
                     and was at last within long gun-shot distance in the lugger's wake.</p>
                  <p>"Curse him!" shouted Barney, as shot after shot fell close behind his rudder
                     post, "he'll be aboard us, soon, at this rate."</p>
                  <p>But there was no help for him now!</p>
                  <p>They soon approached the point which Heath aimed to reach, in the event that it
                     should prove impracticable to put out to sea; and the wind still increased to a
                     sharper blow than he had calculated on. Suddenly, as they rounded up under the
                     lee of a bar that runs out a league or two to the northward of Portland Bill,
                     an ominous creaking was heard, and a manifest swaying of the ricketty old
                     foremast of the lugger warned Barney that he must relieve it, or it would soon
                     go by the board. He immediately ordered the foresails to be lowered, and as
                     soon as this came down, the Arrow had it all her own way.</p>
                  <p>Still, Barney went on. He was already within the shoals, and half an hour more
                     would place him upon the flats, where the cutter could not follow him. He
                     pushed on, as best he could. The cutter was close behind him, the tide was at
                     low ebb, and fifteen minutes afterward he was hard aground among the seaweed.
                     The cutter had gradually shortened sail, and she now stood off and on, under
                     close-reefed foresail and jib, almost within hailing distance of the lugger,
                     still watching her movements, though Hargreve could not yet determine what
                     course he ought to pursue.</p>
                  <p>Night was coming on. Another shot, and then another followed from the swivel
                     guns of the cutter. At last, a more successful ball struck the mizen-mast of
                     the smuggler and it came down over the stern with a heavy crash, killing and
                     maiming four or five of the crew, and rendering the lugger a helpless wreck for
                     the time being.</p>
                  <p>The Arrow's two boats were now instantly manned, and every one of the crew,
                     except such as were necessary to be left to work the vessel, headed by
                     Hargreve, and the lieutenant, set out for the wreck. They were thoroughly
                     armed, and though the commander of the cutter knew that he must "fight for it,"
                     he went forward with the determination of capturing Barney and his officers,
                     whom he had reason to believe, from the reports of those who knew them in that
                     region, were the "head and front" of the smuggler gang that had so long
                     infested that vicinity, and who had thus far carried on their nefarious trade
                     so successfully.</p>
                  <p>Upon reaching the scene where the dismasted lugger lay, Hargreve instantly
                     discovered the smugglers in a sort of launch, just pulling away from under the
                     lee of the Blue Wing, with a heavy boat load of kegs! This was enough, if the
                     wilful conduct of Barney had not previously rendered him liable.</p>
                  <p>"Give way, lads!" he shouted, as he sprang up from the sternsheets, "give way,
                     and board her!" The oars of the cutter's boats were bent to it with a will, and
                     they were immediately alongside of the lugger's heavy boat.</p>
                  <p>It was no child's-play, however, that succeeded this. The moment the
                     government-sailors grappled with the smugglers, and it became a hand-to-hand
                     struggle, they showed themselves sturdy fellows, who could fight better than
                     they could run!</p>
                  <p>But the odds were decidedly against them. They were out-numbered and were
                     indifferently armed, while the cutter's crew were every one prepared for
                     conflict. Some jumped out of the boats, and struggled to the shore, after the
                     first onslaught; some were entangled in the long sea-grass and were secured or
                     drowned; and a few of them fell beneath the sabres and cutlasses of the Arrow's
                     crew. The boat was taken, and two hundred and eighteen kegs of smuggled brandy
                     were found in her, and on board the lugger, subsequently.</p>
                  <p>Barney made for the shore at last, but was discovered, forcing his way through
                     the seaweed before he had reached the land. One of the cutter's boats,
                     commanded by Hargreve, instantly put away in pursuit of him. They reached the
                     shore together. Hargreve sprang forward, and seized the old offender, and being
                     backed by three of his best men, he succeeded in grounding him after a hard
                     fight. Brace was seriously wounded by a blow from Barney's knife. Hargreve
                     received a severe wound, too, across the shoulder, and a third man was badly
                     cut up, in this <foreign xml:lang="FRA">melee.</foreign> But the hardy
                     Scotchman was struck to the ground at last, and was eventually carried aboard
                     the cutter, in irons.</p>
                  <p>The property was all seized, a crew was put on board the lugger, temporarily,
                     and Hargreve sailed immediately with the prisoners he had taken, for the port
                     of Southampton.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE FATE OF THE SMUGGLER.</head>
                  <p>BARNEY HEATH was hurt in the struggle. The Arrow arrived at Southampton the
                     next day at noon, the wind being contrary for the most of the time, and the
                     cutter making but slow progress till after daylight on the following
                     morning.</p>
                  <p>The surgeon of the station was called immediately on reaching port, and the
                     news of the capture of the lugger and the arrest of Barney and his men quickly
                     spread through the neighborhood. The cuts that Barney had received were found
                     to be more severe than either himself or Hargreve had been led to
                     believe—though he had suffered very badly from loss of blood on the passage up
                     from the scene of his trouble.</p>
                  <p>"It's no matter, boy," said Barney, when Hargreve informed him that he had sent
                     for the surgeon, and was sorry he was hurt; "it's no matter! Better men than
                     Barney Heath have died in the same cause. The English government is welcome to
                     all it can now make out of me and mine. I shan't live long to be plagued by
                     'em, that's certain. It <emph>was</emph> a hard hit, though, boy, that last
                     sabre-cut o' yours. But I stood by to the last, didn't I?"</p>
                  <p>"Barney," said Hargreve, pitying the unfortunate man, "you deserve a better
                     fate. You stood by your comrades like a Trojan. I am sorry I hurt you—but I was
                     doing only my official duty in that conflict."</p>
                  <p>"Right, boy, all right! You did well—bravely! You've done what none o' the rest
                     of 'em were able to do. You've taken Barney Heath, and caught him 'in the act.'
                     But it's too late for mumbling now, eh, doctor?" continued Heath, as the
                     surgeon laid bare his wounds for examination.</p>
                  <p>"It is an ugly cut, certainly, Barney," said the physician, in a mild tone.
                     "But we will see what we can do."</p>
                  <p>"Can you give me breath, doctor?" continued Heath, whose paling countenance and
                     low breathing denoted that his injuries had very seriously weakened him. "I
                     want breath, doctor, <emph>breath!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"Keep perfectly quiet, now, Barney, or you'll set the wound bleeding again, and
                     that would render your condition dangerous."</p>
                  <p>The surgeon then turned to dress the gash which Hargreve had received upon his
                     shoulder, which had only been hastily staunched at the close of the conflict.
                     Barney turned his eyes towards the scene, and said:</p>
                  <p>"You were damaged, too, boy?"</p>
                  <p>"A stab from your knife, Barney; but not a bad one, I think."</p>
                  <p>As the surgeon turned the shirt from Hargreve's shoulder, Barney raised himself
                     up, quickly, and cried:</p>
                  <p>"Let me see him! Come nearer, boy! Quick, quick. I haven't heard your name,
                     yet. Tell me," he continued in a whisper, "is it—is it Hargreve? George
                     Hargreve? Say, is it not?"</p>
                  <p>"That is my name, Barney."</p>
                  <p>"I knew it!" shrieked the poor smuggler, as he fell back heavily upon his
                     pallet and fainted.</p>
                  <p>The exertion disarranged his bandages, and as he came to himself, once more,
                     the blood started afresh. The surgeon turned his attention to the sufferer, and
                     said to Hargreve:</p>
                  <p>"Cover your shoulder, lieutenant. This man will certainly bleed to death,
                     unless we can keep him still."</p>
                  <p>"Never mind—never mind <emph>me,</emph> doctor," cried Heath, "let me see the
                     boy."</p>
                  <p>When Hargreve approached him, he continued:</p>
                  <p>"George, do you know John Maitland?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, Barney; what of him?"</p>
                  <p>"Send for him—quick! I am dying, George, send for John Maitland."</p>
                  <p>As soon as the matter could be arranged, a boat was sent ashore, and a despatch
                     was forwarded to Sunnyside, requesting the immediate attendance of Maitland on
                     board the Arrow. It was signed by George Hargreve, and it reached its
                     destination promptly. Mr. Maitland did not delay responding to it, and reached
                     the cabin of the cutter before sunset. Barney was glad to see him.</p>
                  <p>"I have no time for compliments, Maitland," said the smuggler, who had been
                     growing weaker and weaker in the last four hours. "Send these people out—send
                     'em away; I must see you alone—<emph>alone.</emph>"</p>
                  <p>The request of Barney was instantly complied with, though Mr. Maitland did not
                     exactly fancy the part he was thus unceremoniously required to take in this
                     affair. However, the man was plainly too weak to do him any injury, and so he
                     sat down by him.</p>
                  <p>"I'm a poor devil, 'Squire Maitland, an' I'm dying, I am sure," said Barney.
                     "Do you know George Hargreve?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I know him. What of George?"</p>
                  <p>"He is the adopted son of William Hargreve?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, the same."</p>
                  <p>"How old is he?"</p>
                  <p>"One, or two-and-twenty, I think."</p>
                  <p>"Do you recollect Sophia Glessin?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, yes! The clothier's wife?"</p>
                  <p>"The same. She is dead, is she not?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes my poor sister died many years ago."</p>
                  <p>"<emph>How</emph> many, 'squire?"</p>
                  <p>"Nearly a score of years since."</p>
                  <p>"I am very weak, very, Maitland!" said Barney, who failed rapidly. "She had a
                     child before her marriage, with—with Glessin, eh, Maitland?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, yes—"</p>
                  <p>"What became of it?"</p>
                  <p>"It died, so we were informed, in infancy."</p>
                  <p>"No, Maitland—no! It was a boy. He lived—lived—and grew up. Glessin absconded—a
                     bankrupt; and his friend—friend Marlock, took the baby, and—and—"</p>
                  <p>"Well, go on, Barney—say what you have to add," replied Mr. Maitland, who had
                     become deeply moved by this brief narrative. "Speak out, Barney."</p>
                  <p>"He has a ring—his mother's—he don't know it. See Marlock. George, I
                     mean—that's <emph>the boy.</emph> Look on his shoulder—see a long scar, there.
                     He will remember the cause of it. The child didn't die. Marlock turned him over
                     to Mait—I mean to Hargreve. O, my head swims, swim—sir—"</p>
                  <p>"But, Barney, pray tell me if you know—"</p>
                  <p>"No—no!" gasped the smuggler—"not dead!"</p>
                  <p>"But, George Hargreve; what of <emph>him?</emph>" continued Mr. Maitland,
                     deeply excited.</p>
                  <p>After a moment, the smuggler's teeth became set, and a terrible paleness
                     overspread his features, as he muttered:</p>
                  <p>"No, he can't! Can't take—Barney Heath, alive! I'll—see—George Hargreve.
                     Not—dead!"</p>
                  <p>Mr. Maitland looked in the sufferer's face, and deeply alarmed, he called the
                     officers and surgeon of the cutter into the cabin.</p>
                  <p>"Quick, gentlemen!" he said. "This man is very ill."</p>
                  <p>They approached his pallet, the surgeon raised his hand. His eyes were fixed,
                     but Barney Heath was stone dead! The doctor placed his hand upon the smuggler's
                     heart and listened, while he gently pressed upon it.</p>
                  <p>"Pulsation has ceased, gentlemen," he said. Poor Barnabas Heath had gone to his
                     last account.</p>
                  <p>"What did he say?" asked the lieutenant. "What had he to communicate, Mr.
                     Maitland?"</p>
                  <p>After an instant of reflection, Mr. Maitland replied:</p>
                  <p>"Nothing. That is, he said nothing coherently. He commenced to ask questions,
                     but fainted<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC5953-00000010"/> with the exertion. He made
                     out nothing at all that was clear, or intelligible to me. He has been a bad
                     man. Does he leave any family?"</p>
                  <p>"I understand he has no connections here, at all," said the surgeon. "I have
                     know him by repute, for a long time."</p>
                  <p>"Are <emph>you</emph> hurt, too?" asked Mr. Maitland, suddenly, as he observed
                     the bloody shirt and bandages upon Hargreve's shoulder.</p>
                  <p>"No, it is nothing, nothing, sir. We had just been dressing the slight cut, as
                     you came in, sir."</p>
                  <p>The surgeon removed the lint, and now washed the wound of the lieutenant, in
                     Maitland's presence. The old gentleman did not fail to observe the long scar
                     upon Hargreve's shoulder; but he concluded, for the present, to say nothing
                     more about what Heath had so indirectly hinted to him. He was satisfied,
                     however, in his own mind, that the matter was worth further investigation; and
                     he determined to go about unravelling it, at the earliest convenient
                     moment.</p>
                  <p>The authorities were duly advised of the capture of the lugger, and the
                     circumstances attending it. The government approved and applauded Hargreve's
                     conduct, which was really a very creditable performance for so young an
                     officer; and the neighborhood were very grateful to the lieutenant, for the
                     service he rendered in breaking up the gang of contrabandists, at least for a
                     time.</p>
                  <p>The fame of Lieutenant Hargreve spread through the south of England,
                     astonishingly! In the long experience of the people in that section, no such
                     exploit as that of the capture of Barney Heath had before been known. It cost
                     some of his men dearly, but the lieutenant escaped with a little rough handling
                     and a single wound, which soon healed, however.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Maitland immediately insisted that Hargreve should come up to Sunnyside, at
                     least until he should completely recover from his hurt; but as it did not prove
                     of a serious character, he remained on board the Arrow for the present.</p>
                  <p>The secretary sent him a very handsome letter, and his prospects were
                     brightening latterly. Still, he was uneasy, and desirous for a change from the
                     routine of his present duties, which, soon after this <emph>event</emph> in his
                     life, became dull and commonplace.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Maitland was not idle. He had got a clue to the history of the
                     child he was anxious to learn about, and he now sought the man
                        <emph>Marlock,</emph> whom he believed could fully enlighten him, on a
                     subject in which he felt the liveliest interest.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
                  <head type="sub">EDWARD HARGREVE'S ADOPTED SON.</head>
                  <p>MR. EDWARD HARGREVE was a merchant at Southampton. He was reputed to be
                     wealthy, and his name, on 'change, was believed to be as good as the bank of
                     England, for any amount, for which he would sign it. He was a kindhearted man,
                     liberal to the needy, and desirous of making the friends around him prosperous
                     and happy.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Edward Hargreve had become responsible, however, for the transactions of
                     others, in whom he had too credulously reposed confidence, and after a series
                     of ill fortune on their part, he found his property embarrassed for the debts
                     and bonds of his "friends," almost beyond the hope of redemption, through his
                     own efforts. Yet, he continued to struggle on. He lived with economy, labored
                     diligently to avert any catastrophe, managed his dubious pecuniary matters
                     shrewdly, and continued, for the present to keep the hitherto honored and
                     honorable name of Edward Hargreve out of the columns of the Bankrupt's
                     Gazette.</p>
                  <p>About twenty years previously, a distant relative of Mr. Hargreve, who resided
                     at Newbury, and with whom Mr. Hargreve had never had much to do, came down to
                     Southampton on business. His name was Marlock, and he brought with him a little
                     boy—a fine-looking, rosy cheek ed fellow—who attracted considerable notice,
                     from his natural brightness and comely looks. Mr. Hargreve, at that time, had
                     never met Marlock, but once before—but the man hunted out his "rich relative,"
                     and called upon Hargreve, while in town, accompanied by the child.</p>
                  <p>Marlock had then recently buried his wife, and desired to provide for this boy
                     (whom he called his (baby), as he had no other children, and he was not now in
                     a condition to care for and educate him as he wished to do. The child was a
                     promising one. Mr. Hargreve took a fancy to him—he was childless, himself—and
                     the result of their interview was that Marlock should leave little George with
                     his family, and he agreed to adopt him. Marlock shortly afterwards left the
                     country for a long while, and the child became a pet in Mr. Hargreve's
                     household. Nothing further was heard of Marlock, the boy's name was changed at
                     once to Hargreve, he grew up as the son of that gentleman, and was not made
                     acquainted with the circumstances of his adoption, for reasons that were
                     satisfactory to Mr. Hargreve and his wife.</p>
                  <p>The child did not belong, legitimately, to Marlock, however. One Glessin, an
                     unfortunate and dissolute clothier, at Colchester, had eloped with a fair young
                     girl of a neighboring town, whom he deceived in regard to his pecuniary
                     prospects and possessions. Prior to her legal marriage, which was subsequently
                     consummated, however, she gave birth to a son. She died—<pb n="22-23"
                        xml:id="VAC5953-00000011"/> Glessin decamped, under disgraceful
                     circumstances, and the infant fell into the hands of Marlock, who would have
                     provided for him, eventually, had not death taken away his wife, while George
                     was so young. It was a fortunate arrangement, he thought, when Hargreve
                     proposed to adopt the boy, and he very gladly relinquished all further claim
                     upon him, when Mr. Hargreve so opportunely offered to receive him as his own
                     child. The name of Marlock was almost entirely forgotten, after so long a
                     period; it was never mentioned in connection with George, or his history, and
                     while he grew up in total ignorance of the facts that so intimately concerned
                     him, the secret of his actual birth was supposed by Hargreve, and his wife, to
                     be entirely in their keeping.</p>
                  <p>When the facts of the disgrace of Glessin's subsequent wife was known by her
                     friends and family, all of whom had been kept in ignorance of her whereabouts,
                     even—for a long time after her elopement—her relatives did not seek her society
                     again. They had strenuously advised her against Glessin, who was unfortunately
                     known to be dissolute, and entirely unworthy of her; and when she ran away with
                     him, all further claims upon their favor were annulled. She loved this man,
                     however, she followed him, succumbed to his unhappy fortunes, suffered with
                     him, and died, at last, leaving her infant behind her, as we have stated.</p>
                  <p>This woman was the sister of John Maitland! At the time of her trouble, her
                     brother John was absent, in the East Indies. He was then rapidly acquiring
                     fortune, which he ultimately gathered together, and, returning to his native
                     land, with enormous wealth, accumulated by a twenty years' residence in the
                     East, he settled down at Sunnyside, where he commenced to enjoy life, amid the
                     highest splendor and ease. He heard with pain, of his sister's error, and her
                     decease. He learned the common rumor that her child was dead, too, and as he
                     had never known much of the details of the circumstances, so unpleasant to
                     dwell upon, at all, he permitted her history to be buried with her, and rarely
                     alluded to her in any manner whatever, after his return.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Hargreve was Maitland's personal friend. He had in former years transacted
                     considerable business with him, and he knew him well. When George Hargreve came
                     to Sunnyside to visit him, he liked his appearance much. He had met him,
                     previously once or twice, and to his influence with the admiralty,
                     particularly, though the boy did not know it, was young Hargreve indebted for
                     his late promotion to the command of the Arrow.</p>
                  <p>Immediately after listening to the broken account given by old Barney Heath, in
                     the cabin of the cutter, in reference to the history of the lieutenant, Mr.
                     Maitland hastened to ascertain how it agreed with facts that he could
                     imperfectly make out, from other and more creditable sources. But Marlock could
                     not then be found. Ten days afterwards, however, communication was had with a
                     brother of his, and the principal facts, so far as he was concerned, were at
                     once substantiated. Glessin had not been heard of for more than a score of
                     years; and it was presumed he was long since dead. He was a bad man, bad in
                     principle, bad in all his aims and acts. The community where he had dwelt had
                     felt this, and Colchester did not grieve when he suddenly and permanently took
                     himself away.</p>
                  <p>The body of the deceased Heath was taken ashore from the cutter, and was
                     decently buried. His companions who were arrested, were tried, and disposed of
                     by the government. The lugger was confiscated, with her entire cargo, and
                     subsequently Hargreve was pecuniarily rewarded, both by the national and the
                     local authorities. Mr. Maitland continued his researches, at every opportunity,
                     and eventually he was fully confirmed in the belief that George Hargreve was
                     unquestionably his unfortunate sister's son. The ring he wore was finally
                     examined by the constantly inquisitive Mr. Maitland, and he found beneath its
                     seal, almost entirely defaced, from the wearing, the initials of his sister's
                     maiden name! He questioned him regarding the scar upon his shoulder, but young
                     Hargreve could remember nothing about it. Nevertheless, Maitland had seen this
                     mark, to which Barney Heath had especially alluded, and he was satisfied that
                     the lieutenant was his own nephew. He resolved accordingly; and forthwith went
                     about putting into execution a plan which he had hitherto fixed upon, in his
                     own mind (if opportunity should permit), to improve the condition and prospects
                     of George Hargreve, to whom he had been very favorably inclined, from his first
                     acquaintance with him. And now that he was satisfied in regard to his origin,
                     though he scrupulously avoided any allusion to the knowledge he possessed of
                     his paternity, he felt more solicitous than ever that young Hargreve should be
                     made to profit by his well-meant intentions towards him.</p>
                  <p>Besides this, he was glad of the opportunity to render Mr. Hargreve, senior,
                     such aid as he believed might follow indirectly upon the results of his scheme.
                     The foster-father of George was a high-minded and strictly honorable man,
                     though he now labored with pecuniary difficulties. But he would not willingly
                     be under obligations to Mr. Maitland, and the wealthy proprietor of Sunnyside
                     knew this. He had in view the assistance of <emph>his sister's child,</emph>
                     who he felt certain would turn any pecuniary advantages that might fall to his
                     lot, to the bettering of his father's condition.</p>
                  <p>As yet, young Hargreve knew nothing of Mr. Maitland's intentions, nor did that
                     gentleman communicate his plan to any one else. He had recently returned from a
                     visit to the north, where be had been in search of some further confirmatory
                     evidence regarding the boy, and more especially with a view of furthering his
                     scheme to help his nephew. He had also communicated with his personal friend,
                     the government secretary of naval affairs, en route homeward from
                     Liverpool.</p>
                  <p>George Hargreve was still occupied on the southern station, as commander of the
                     Arrow, and his life was one continual routine, of the details of which he had
                     become heartily tired, when, one morning, he received a pressing note from Mr.
                     Maitland, to visit Sunnyside. The letter enclosed another from the secretary,
                     offering him leave of absence for a month, from his duties, a very acceptable
                     proffer, which the lieutenant quickly availed himself of!</p>

                  <head type="sub">A FRIEND IN NEED.</head>
                  <p>As soon as the order arrived from London relieving Lieutenant Hargreve, and
                     temporarily appointing his successor in charge of the cutter, the former left
                     the Arrow directly; and, after paying a brief visit to his much-loved father,
                     whom he had never known only as a true and faithful parent, he repaired to
                     Sunnyside, once more, to enjoy a temporary season of rest and recreation, and
                     to learn the pleasure of its kindly proprietor, who had latterly evinced so
                     great an interest in his affairs.</p>
                  <p>When the young man was fairly settled at Sunnyside, Mr. Maitland took an early
                     opportunity to open to him the plan he had thought of, for his benefit; and,
                     seated with him in his library, the following day after his arrival at the
                     mansion, he thus addressed him:</p>
                  <p>"You have now a month's furlough, George, and I have been looking about for an
                     opportunity for you, whereby you may reap a heavy pecuniary advantage,
                     eventually, I think, if you will follow my advice. At your leisure, you can
                     examine into my proposal, and let me know how you feel disposed in the
                     premises."</p>
                  <p>"My dear sir," said the grateful youth, "you are very kind to me, and I am not
                     aware to what particular circumstance in my life I am indebted for such
                     unexpected consideration at your hands."</p>
                  <p>"Never mind that, George. Your father and I are old friends. He is too
                     high-minded to ask favors of me, and perhaps it is just as well. Say, then, if
                     you need a reason for my conduct, that I would oblige your excellent parent, or
                     whatever you will, but suffer me to advise you, now."</p>
                  <p>"I am greatly your debtor, sir, already," replied young Hargreve, "and I
                     promise you, at the outset, that I shall appreciate the motives which induce
                     you to make any suggestions that I may avail myself of, to improve my
                     unfortunate father's condition."</p>
                  <p>"Very well, then. You are a sailor. There is now lying in the port of
                     Liverpool, preparing for sea, an excellent bark, belonging to a friend of mine,
                     which is bound to India and China, on a trading voyage in the east; and there
                     is, at present, a vacancy in the supercargo's place, which I desire you should
                     occupy. What do you think of such a chance?"</p>
                  <p>"Really, sir, I don't know what to reply. This is entirely new, unexpected to
                     me. And I am at a loss to answer you. I should very much like it, I think, if I
                     had the means to—"</p>
                  <p>"On that score the business is settled, George. It will be necessary for you to
                     throw up your commission—"</p>
                  <p>"I care little for that, sir—"</p>
                  <p>"Then there can be no impediment that may not be overcome. If it will please
                     you, I assure you it is by no means an ordinary opportunity."</p>
                  <p>"So I was thinking, sir."</p>
                  <p>"I am quite sure of it, George. You know I have had some experience in this
                     business. I began life as the almost moneyless supercargo of a Calcutta ship. I
                     met with rare good luck on my first voyage, and as you are aware I subsequently
                     settled in China, and accumulated a handsome property. You are a younger man
                     than I was, and you are far better qualified for the duties that I then
                     assumed. You can easily become rich, there, if you will; and I will gladly aid
                     you in your fitting-out, if you will allow me."</p>
                  <p>"I accept your offer, then, Mr. Maitland, most gratefully, and with but a
                     single qualification."</p>
                  <p>"And what is that?"</p>
                  <p>"That my father will consent. He is now under the weather, you know, somewhat,
                     and may not care to part with me at present. If he is willing, however, and I
                     will ascertain his pleasure immediately, I am ready to resign my lieutenantcy,
                     and will gladly embrace your kind proposal."</p>
                  <p>"You will need to give yourself no uneasiness or trouble on that score, George.
                     I have already heard from him, to-day, in regard to my proposition, which I
                     suggested to him first. He does not like to be separated from you, for he loves
                     you, but he sees what I see; that you cannot fail to profit by this change, and
                     he consents to our plan, cheerfully."</p>
                  <p>"Thank you, sir, again, then, for your earnest and friendly consideration. What
                     shall I do first? I will follow your instructions, implicitly."</p>
                  <p>"Then I will advise you, first, to proceed to Liverpool, without unnecessary
                     delay; and I will give you letters to the owners of the barque, which will
                     ensure you a cordial reception there. You can confer with them, examine the
                     vessel, ascertain whatever details it may be requisite for you to know in
                     reference to the barque, her capacity, the voyage, etc., and let me know how
                     you are pleased with the prospect."</p>
                  <p>"I will do so at once, sir; with many thanks for the interest you may have made
                     in my behalf," said Hargreve, gratefully.</p>
                  <p>"That is all right, George. The owners of the Sea Gull are my friends. I have
                     done a large amount of business with them, and they can well afford to oblige
                     me. I have seen them, engaged the place for a young friend of mine, whom I
                     named to them in confidence, and they will be glad to meet you."</p>
                  <p>"I will aim to merit your favor, sir."</p>
                  <p>"I know you will, and that is why I aid you. You will want some means to
                     arrange for your own adventure, in this voyage—"</p>
                  <p>"That is just where I feared I should fail to—"</p>
                  <p>"O, no! I understand all that, of course. You haven't been able to save much
                     from your salary, George, and your father can't help you to a shilling. I knew
                     all that, too, you see. Whatever money you may need, I will furnish you. I
                     shall authorize you to draw on me, at sight, for six thousand pounds. This will
                     fit you out."</p>
                  <p>"Amply, sir, amply, I judge."</p>
                  <p>"Then you will find use for a few thousands more, for such invoices as you may
                     select to take out with you; the details of which you will be duly informed of,
                     at Liverpool. For all this you will be provided. Withfair luck and good
                     management, such as I know you to be capable of, you may, by this means, lay
                     the foundation for a certain fortune in a few years. Here, you can do nothing
                     but live on from month to month, without much reward for your talents and
                     labor; there, you may become rich, and return home by-and-by to enjoy it. Do
                     you accept?"</p>
                  <p>"Most anxiously and gratefully, sir. If I live—"</p>
                  <p>"You will repay me, and all that, eh?"</p>
                  <p>"You anticipate my thoughts, sir. But if I die—"</p>
                  <p>"Then I shall have done my best to serve you, and your father, George; and I
                     shall never feel the absence of the few readily earned pounds which I most
                     cheerfully invest in this agreeable experiment."</p>
                  <p>On the following evening, Hargreve took a seat in the northern mail coach, and
                     proceeded on his way to Liverpool, in furtherance of Mr. Maitland's plan. He
                     was bearer of the following letter to the owners of the Sea Gull, which
                     Maitland placed in his hands, at the moment of starting, and which will explain
                     the object of his present mission:</p>

                                 Lieutenant George Hargreve, of whom I spoke to you, in reference to
                                 the supercargo-ship of the Sea Gull, when I saw you recently at
                                 Liverpool.</p>
                              <p>"I need only say that Mr. Hargreve is in every way happily
                                 qualified for the vacant place referred to, and that it is my wish
                                 he should join<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC5953-00000013"/> you in the
                                 forthcoming voyage of the barque, destined for Calcutta and
                                 Canton.</p>
                              <p>"His drafts upon me for all such amounts as may be necessary for
                                 his outfit, ventures, etc., will be duly honored on presentation;
                                 and I will bespeak for Mr. Hargreve your best efforts to render his
                                 intercourse with you agreeable, while I trust it will also be

                  <p>This generous letter was everything that Hargreve needed, as he subsequently
                     ascertained. On his arrival at Liverpool, he waited upon the owners, and
                     presented his credentials. He was most graciously received, and every facility
                     was afforded him to ascertain what he needed or desired to know.</p>
                  <p>It was evident to the lieutenant that the friends of Mr. Maitland, in
                     Liverpool, appreciated that gentleman. The utmost deference was paid by them to
                     every suggestion that Hargreve ventured to make, and they finally took him on
                     board the barque, to examine her in dock.</p>
                  <p>The weather was fine, and George enjoyed his trip and his prospects
                     exceedingly. He had not yet resigned his place in the British navy, but such
                     were the impressions he formed, during his visit at Liverpool, that he
                     determined, immediately on his return to Southampton, to place the disposal of
                     his commission in the hands of the secretary of the naval board.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE BRITISH INDIAMAN.</head>
                  <p>THE Sea Gull was a splendid vessel, and her model and general appearance
                     greatly pleased the sailor-eye of the young lieutenant. The business he was now
                     about to embark in was new, and yet it was not new, to him; that is, he was
                     sailor enough for any emergency, but his knowledge of mercantile affairs was of
                     course but limited. The duties of supercargo, however, were to his mind very
                     readily understood, and he commenced the initiative at once.</p>
                  <p>He employed the balance of the time allowed by his furlough, in getting ready
                     to sail for India. He found, after his arrival at Liverpool, that the season
                     was advancing and that it was desirable to get away as rapidly as possible.
                     There was still a good deal to be accomplished, before the barque could sail,
                     at best, and he had much to do, upon his own account, before it would be
                     possible for him to leave. Under the advice and general direction of his
                     owners, therefore, he went to work to prepare for his new duties, and at the
                     expiration of two weeks, he had got things well under way for the beginning of
                     his present enterprise.</p>
                  <p>The Sea Gull was a full sized barque, for those days, of some three hundred and
                     twenty tons, measurement. She had been built with all the then known
                     conveniences and appliances requisite for a first-class vessel intended for the
                     India trade, and had already made one successful voyage to and from Calcutta
                     and Sumatra. Her officers and crew were well chosen, and the substitution of
                     young Hargrave for his predecessor in the office of supercargo, completed a
                     complement of men such as was rarely found on board the best Indiaman that
                     sailed from England. At the end of a fortnight, the lieuteuant returned to
                     Southampton, again. After a brief visit to his father, where the necessary
                     explanations were made in reference to his future designs, he repaired once
                     more to Sunnyside, to confer with his munificent patron, and to prepare finally
                     for his departure to the east.</p>
                  <p>"I am glad to see you, George," said Mr. Maitland, congratulating him,
                     cordially. "Tell me, now, how you like the barque, and the prospect lately
                     opened to you?"</p>
                  <p>"Everything promises auspiciously, sir—thanks to your liberality. The owners of
                     the barque received me with marked kindness, and I found matters in the best
                     possible condition. The Sea Gull is a very handsome craft, and I judge her to
                     be an excellent sailer. I ventured some few suggestions to her owners and the
                     commander, which I was gratified to notice they adopted, before I left, and I
                     see no reason why we may not be eminently prosperous in this enterprise."</p>
                  <p>"You have made such purchases as you deemed advisable, I presume?"</p>
                  <pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC5953-00000014"/>
                  <p>"Everything is in train, sir. The master of the barque is an old salt, and his
                     experience in the trade will be of great advantage to me. I have a good deal to
                     learn yet, however, Mr. Maitland."</p>
                  <p>"That is a matter of course. But the facilities you have now placed in your
                     hands, and the disposition of all concerned to push forward your interests,
                     while at the same time they may avail themselves of your seamanship and general
                     nautical knowledge, will enable you mutually to benefit each other, and turn
                     your positions and experience to the general advantage of the venture."</p>
                  <p>"So it appears to be understood, sir."</p>
                  <p>"When do you sail?"</p>
                  <p>"On Monday week, sir."</p>
                  <p>"So soon?"</p>
                  <p>"There will be no delay, sir, after this week, except to bend a new set of
                     sails, in part. The cargo is being stowed with all convenient despatch, and I
                     have promised to return to Liverpool within ten days. In the meantime, I shall
                     forward my resignation to the department, and get ready for the voyage."</p>
                  <p>"Very good. Let us enjoy as much of your leisure at Sunnyside, as may be
                     agreeable and in accordance with your engagements before you leave, and bear in
                     mind that you will always be a welcome guest with us here, George."</p>
                  <p>"I shall not forget this, sir. To-morrow, I must run down aboard the Arrow, and
                     get away my traps. The next day, I will write to the secretary. I must give a
                     day or two to my father and his family, and then, sir—ho! for India!"</p>
                  <p>"Is there no <emph>other</emph> young friend to whom you will devote a few
                     private hours, before you leave, George?" asked Mr. Maitland, suspiciously.</p>
                  <p>"No, sir, no," said Hargreve, quickly. "I know what you <emph>suspect;</emph>
                     but I assure you I have never had much time to devote to the kind of 'young
                     friend,' to which I presume you now so felicitously allude. And besides this,
                     if I had had more leisure, I have never enjoyed the means, or the prospect,
                     that would warrant any particular attention on my part toward the other
                     sex."</p>
                  <p>"This is very well, George, and confirms the opinion I had previously
                     entertained of your good judgment. There is time enough—time enough, my son.
                     And you <emph>may</emph> meet with those in the course of your prospective
                     wanderings, who may be quite as worthy of you as those you leave behind
                     you."</p>
                  <p>"Time will decide all that, sir. I have now in view an object of more
                     consequence, in my estimation, than this, and one which I cannot but think, as
                     a matter of filial duty, calls far more loudly upon my exertions in the
                     present. I would save my father from future embarrassment, sir, if possible,
                     and I believe I shall now be able to help him."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, yes. You are right, George, and I honor the motives which actuate you.
                     Go, then. And may you prosper as you deserve," said Mr. Maitland, warmly.</p>
                  <p>The resignation of Lieutenant Hargreve in the British navy had been duly
                     accepted. The moment of leave-taking had passed. He had bid adieu to his
                     family, and had shaken the hand of his kind friend Mr. Maitland, finally,
                     before he started for the north, again. His young associates on board the Arrow
                     were in deep regret to learn of his having left the service, and his crew who
                     loved him, were also sorry to part with so kind a commander and so efficient a
                     seaman.</p>
                  <p>He reached Liverpool at the appointed time, where he found everything
                     progressing admirably. His merchandize was all on board, the barque had been
                     put in complete sailing order, and but a very little delay occurred after his
                     arrival. His requisite authority was made out, the preliminaries were all
                     adjusted, and the signal for departure was finally given on board the handsome
                     and well appointed Sea Gull.</p>
                  <p>George Hargreve thought of everything that he desired to remember, or attend
                     to, prior to sailing, notwithstanding the confusion and embarrassments under
                     which he naturally labored at such a time, and under such peculiar
                     circumstances. He wrote a hasty but affectionate letter to his loved
                     foster-father, and the parting hour he devoted to his patron, in the following
                     epistle, which he sent down by mail, on his way to the dock:</p>

                                 hope to be able to return to England at a future day, with fortune
                                 and honor.</p>
                              <p>"The amount of your investments in my behalf in this present
                                 undertaking, as per memoranda below, I find to be eleven thousand
                                 two hundred pounds. For all this, I heartily thank you; and, lest
                                 some accident may befall me, and we should not meet again, I have
                                 thought proper to effect an insurance upon my life, which I have
                                 accordingly attended to, in the London Loan and Trust Company, for
                                 the sum of twelve thousand pounds sterling; which, as you will
                                 note, is made over to yourself, in case of my death, and which I
                                 now enclose herein. If I live you will be repaid, with interest. If
                                 I die, you are thus pecuniarily secured from loss in this

                  <p>Within the next hour after this letter had been despatched, young Hargreve was
                     on board the Sea Gull, which had got under weigh with beautiful promise, and
                     was now headed for the Irish Channel, before a spanking breeze.</p>
                  <p>The letter reached its destination by due course of mail. Mr. Maitland was
                     happy to hear from the young man, but the delicacy of the business transaction
                     that accompanied the missive struck him with singular favor. He deposited the
                     insurance policy in his strong box, and complimented Hargreve, earnestly, for
                     this exhibition of forethought and unanticipated propriety.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE BELLE OF THE ORIENT.</head>
                  <p>IN the great city of Calcutta, there dwelt at this time one Sedd Rajab, a
                     member of the order of Bhysya, or mercantile fraternity, in India, whose wealth
                     was untold, and whose consequence among his associates was very great. Rajab
                     was an old man, nearly sixty, and his property had been accumulated in the
                     previous half century by his communication with the Portuguese, and afterwards
                     with British residents in Calcutta, Madras and Bombay.</p>
                  <p>Rajab was surrounded by a horde of <foreign xml:lang="HIN">soodras,</foreign>
                     who came and went at his beck or call with astonishing alacrity. This
                     fraternity is now the one extreme of society in India, generally, and the
                     Brahmins is the other. In former times, there were four or five distinct
                     classes, or <foreign xml:lang="HIN">castes,</foreign> in society—as Brahmins,
                     Kyetra, or Rajaputs, Bhysya, or Vaisa Soodras and Parias. Since the French and
                     English have settled among this people, notwithstanding their intense
                     attachment to the ancient usages of their land and nations, certain
                     modifications have taken place, from time to time—until now there are but two
                     classes, the upper and lower, recognizable as distinct <foreign xml:lang="HIN"
                        >castes.</foreign>
                  </p>
                  <p>Rajab's style of living was luxurious, and there was really no end to his
                     wealth and his expenditure. In the earlier days of the Portuguese and French
                     settlements in India, he had been among the most successful of the native
                     traders; and up to within a few years of the time when we now speak of him, he
                     was very largely interested in the most profitable trade of that splendid
                     country.</p>
                  <p>Rajab did not marry until he was nearly forty. At that time he was in the
                     enjoyment of a magnificent fortune, and was known as one of the richest of the
                     Bhysya tribe. He wedded the daughter of a deceased merchant of his class, whose
                     wealth was also very great. The Hindoos, generally, are of a swarthy
                     complexion—not unlike the Spanish population; but the higher orders are as
                     white as Europeans, and many of the females are remarkably beautiful, both in
                     features and complexion. The men are notorious for their shrewdness, frugality,
                     and generous manners, and probably, while no country on the globe affords equal
                     facilities for the amassing of wealth, so no other people equal this in their
                     tact and readiness in acquiring it. The introduction of civilization among
                     them—though it carried with it manifold evils—gave the natives an immense
                     impulse, and for a long series of years both foreigners and residents got
                     rapidly rich, by the changes that occurred.</p>
                  <p>Sedd Rajab had been one of the foremost of his thriving race. It is well known
                     that at Calcutta the society is of the gayest and most splendid character. The
                     dwellings of the higher classes are handsome, and the hospitality of both
                     Mussulman and emigrant is proverbial, the world over. The entire absence, at
                     that period, of public houses of any sort, rendered this feeling in the
                     community a necessity, in a measure; and every new-comer at that city was
                     compelled to be domiciled in some private family, where his living proved
                     enormously expensive, but surely agreeable, so long as he enjoyed the benefits
                     of health and a well-filled purse!</p>
                  <p>Three years after their marriage, the wife of Rajab gave birth to a daughter,
                     who grew up to womanhood a blooming Eastern beauty. This proved their only
                     child, and a fortune was lavished upon her education. Katrin was the idol of
                     her father, and she deserved all his fond devotion; for, while her charms were
                     undisputed and unrivalled, her qualities of heart and mind were well adapted to
                     her extreme loveliness and her brilliant position in life.</p>
                  <p>The constant communication of the family with English and French residents soon
                     gave the parents a knowledge of their tongues, and Rajab took great pains,
                     notwithstanding his natural inclinations to observe the exclusiveness of his
                     order, in reference to other details, to have his daughter instructed and
                     accomplished in the language of the English, and many of their higher
                     qualifications. Katrin proved a ripe scholar, and at eighteen years of age
                     would scarcely have been suspected as the descendant of native Hindoo parents,
                     even among the foreigners dwelling in the country!</p>
                  <p>The indigo from Delhi and Bengal, the silks furnished from Orissa and the
                     country around it, the Madras cotton goods, the Bengal sugars and bamboo—and
                     the opium, poppies, mango, palms, dates, and other commodities of a
                     merchantable character—all contributed to fill the storehouses of Sedd Rajab,
                     and he was still the munificent merchant that he had been for nearly two scores
                     of years; when he was suddenly reminded that his health was failing, and that
                     he must soon pay the final debt of nature, unless he could meet with
                     substantial aid for his bodily trouble.</p>
                  <p>The services of a learned Brahmin were secured, who undertook the cure of old
                     Rajab. He applied himself with marked assiduity to his experiments, and the
                     sufferer submitted patiently to his long-continued treatment—but the sick man
                     did not improve. Could the Brahmin have accomplished his purpose, a brilliant
                     fortune would have been his reward. But he failed to effect any real
                     improvement, and the climate of that country, unfortunately, was such, that
                     Rajab had little hopes, in fact, from the first, of a permanent recovery. The
                     disease became seated, at last, the old man relinquished the further use of the
                     physician's nostrums, turned to a quiet and careful diet, and suffered on, with
                     his really incurable malady.</p>
                  <p>With a deep solicitude, fair Katrin watched the evidently declining health of
                     her loved and honored father, but she could only yield him her sympathy amid
                     his trouble. She continued to grow in beauty and accomplishments, and had
                     become the brilliant centre of the gayest circle in Calcutta. Her ruddy
                     brunette complexion, her magnificent form, her eyes and ringlets of jet, her
                     polished manners and elevated conversation, her ready ability to communicate
                     with all who came to enjoy her father's noted hospitality, whether from abroad
                     or from the interior—English, French or Hindoo—rendered her companionship most
                     fortunate and desirable; and, while scores of the best citizens in the land,
                     and of every nation, paid court to her, directly or indirectly, in the form of
                     lovers or admirers, there were none who disputed the claim of Katrin, the
                     beautiful, to the rightful title she had so long enjoyed, as the "<emph>Belle
                        of the Orient!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>Unfortunately for the prospects of several young gentlemen, who had not failed
                     to become enamored of her striking beauty, the Hindoo religion did not permit
                     Katrin to form any connection whatever with one who was not of her <foreign
                        xml:lang="HIN">caste.</foreign> This tenet seemed to be imperatively binding
                     upon her, and her father ever enjoined upon her the emphatic correctness of his
                     ideas, in this particular. Katrin did not oppose him in his views on the
                     subject, because she entertained no idea of changing her condition at present,
                     in any way; moreover, she had gathered very different notions from his, in this
                     as in some other matters—during the course of her Indo-English education; and,
                     more than all, she had never as yet seen the man she would wed, under any
                     circumstances. She was quite young, very happy, contented and petted at home,
                     and she now looked for no change in her prospects.</p>
                  <p>The fortune of Rajab enabled him to command the skill of the best medical men
                     in the land, and it was given out that whoever would effect a cure of his
                     internal malady should be rewarded with a handsome fortune. The consequence
                     was, that the "medicine men" far and near came to Calcutta to consult with the
                     nabob patient, in the hope of securing the generous<pb n="32-33"
                        xml:id="VAC5953-00000016"/> fee. But all resulted to no efficient purpose.
                     Eventually, Rajab relinquished his business altogether, disposed of his rich
                     stores of merchandize, and, dispirited at last, sat down calmly and resignedly
                     to await the fate which was so palpably and fearfully certain in a few months
                     or years, at most.</p>
                  <p>As his sweet and gentle daughter sat at his side from day to day, and watched
                     the inroads that the fell destroyer was making on her father's constitution, he
                     would mourn and plead with her to observe his wishes regarding her future.</p>
                  <p>"Katrin, beloved," he would say, "fair daughter of my heart, I would live to
                     see thee happy; and then I go contented to join my fathers."</p>
                  <p>"Dear father," Katrin would reply, "Vishnu will watch over and preserve your
                     child! Her trust is in Bruhmha. He will protect her!"</p>
                  <p>The aged parent would kiss the forehead of his lovely daughter, and call down
                     blessings on her head.</p>
                  <p>She watched continuously for aid for him, and at last there came a Brahmin from
                     the East, a learned Celestial, who examined the rich patient and declared that
                     if he would follow his advice, he could save him.</p>
                  <p>He prescribed for him, for the time being, and old Rajab really found himself
                     temporarily relieved! The strange physician then informed him that he
                     understood his case accurately, and if he would journey to China, he would
                     accompany him thither and guarantee his effectual restoration to health
                     again.</p>
                  <p>Rajab consulted with other physicians, and all agreed that a change of climate
                     would certainly do much to improve the invalid. The Chinese doctor was
                     retained, and it was agreed that by the first good vessel which might be bound
                     to Hong Kong or Canton, they would take passage towards the rising sun, and try
                     the virtue of a change of air and scene and medical treatment, under the advice
                     of their newly found friend.</p>
                  <p>Among the letters which young Hargreve received from the hands of his patron at
                     Sunnyside, before leaving England, was one addressed to <hi rend="i"/>Sedd
                     Rajab, Calcutta.</p>
                  <p>"He is an old acquaintance," said Mr. Maitland, when he presented George with
                     this introductory note, "and you will find him a valuable man to communicate
                     with, on your arrival in India. Seek him out, and follow his advice, if he
                     offers it. He knows the country well, and can aid you."</p>
                  <p>It chanced one bright morning soon after Rajab had decided upon trying his
                     journey to Canton, that there appeared in the river Hooghly, in front of the
                     city, a fine new barque, from Liverpool. It proved to be the Sea Gull, which
                     had put into Calcutta for a few days, on her way to her final destination,
                     Canton.</p>
                  <p>The invalid merchant was agreeably surprised a few hours afterwards, while his
                        <foreign xml:lang="HIN">vakeel</foreign> had gone on board the barque to
                     arrange, if possible, for his master's passage, to meet with the young English
                     lieutenant, who brought him a letter from his well-remembered acquaintance,
                     John Maitland; and from whom he learned that there was no doubt that himself
                     and suite could be accommodated as he desired.</p>
                  <p>Old Rajab was even so gracious as casually to present to the English stranger
                     his daughter Katrin, his beloved, and an exceedingly pleasant interview
                     succeeded his call. Hargreve contrived to learn another very agreeable
                     circumstance, in the course of this visit, in conversing upon the subject of
                     Rajab's proposed absence from India—and that was that Katrin would accompany
                     her father abroad.</p>
                  <p>Hargreve repaired on board the Sea Gull, communicated his wishes to the
                     commander, and arrangements were made, forthwith, for the reception and
                     convenience of Rajab's family and attendants, to be conveyed to Canton.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE VOYAGE, AND WHAT ATTENDED IT.</head>
                  <p>THE good barque Sea Gull had made an excellent trip, of less than four months,
                     from Liverpool to Calcutta. The merchandize which George had brought out for
                     this market was quickly disposed of, and the space occupied by their goods was
                     instantly filled up with other articles, in exchange, intended for the Chinese
                     market—among which was a large quantity of Bengal opium—which, though
                     interdicted by the laws of China, was taken out under advice of old Rajab, who
                     knew how money was made in that region of country!</p>
                  <p>The cabin and state-rooms of the barque were nicely fitted up for the wealthy
                     guests that were about to join them on the eastern voyage, and old Rajab was
                     very glad of the opportunity thus afforded him to follow his physician's
                     advice, in so comfortable a style. On the day appointed for sailing, Sedd
                     Rajab, with his daughter, his physician, his vakeel, and a dozen soodras,
                     repaired on board the barque, with innumerable camphor-wood trunks and boxes,
                     bamboo bedsteads and chairs—and such other conveniences as they deemed
                     necessary for their comfort and case on the journey.</p>
                  <p>The weather was fine, and they passed down the river out into the Bay of
                     Bengal, and proceeded, without present hindrance, upon their voyage towards the
                     China Sea, through the Straits of Malacca.</p>
                  <p>It was quickly evident to the officers of the Sea Gull that a very pleasant
                     intimacy was growing up between the youthful supercargo of the barque and the
                     dark-eyed Indian girl, whose remarkable beauty ravished the hearts of all who
                     came in contact with her. Yet her decorum on shipboard was that of a female
                     anchorite! Even George Hargreve—who thought he knew what a woman was, like most
                     other young men who had never had much to do with them—even <emph>he</emph>
                     could draw no word of real encouragement from the lips of the fair Hindoo, who
                     preserved her secrets (if she had any) entirely and exclusively within her own
                     keeping.</p>
                  <p>Yet Hargreve was constantly at the young lady's side, whenever he could be
                     there without manifest intrusion, or when she was not engaged in comforting or
                     chatting with her invalid father. Whatever was said between old Rajab and his
                     child, in their native tongue, of course was worse than Greek to the ears of
                     the young man. He knew nothing of their conversation, or their views, in regard
                     to himself, but, in spite of all his endeavors to win the confidence of old
                     Rajab be found the thing impossible. The rich old Hindoo knew how to treat the
                     young foreigner with cordial politeness, and he was cunning enough to make no
                     display of ill feeling towards him, at any time. Indeed, he was rather well
                     inclined to Hargreve; but he loved his daughter<pb n="34-35"
                        xml:id="VAC5953-00000017"/> ter—and he loved little else, excepting his
                     money!</p>
                  <p>But Rajab was now excusable from being over-agreeable to anybody. He was sick,
                     and sickness rendered him peevish; and he would be attended and nursed only by
                     his daughter, after a time. Hargreve had attempted to utter some pleasant
                     sentiments to Katrin, from time to time, as they proceeded on their voyage, but
                     the black-eyed houri either did not appreciate his hints, or she waited a more
                     fitting opportunity to acknowledge that she comprehended his compliments.</p>
                  <p>Still he rallied the bright beauty at her favorite game of chess, or supported
                     her on the deck of the barque, as they hied away to the east; and as they sped
                     on, he relaxed no jot of his attentions to her, notwithstanding her continual
                     coldness, and seeming apathy in regard to his pretensions. She permitted him to
                     do all the talking—and she only listened, when he ventured to play the gallant.
                     But then she <emph>did</emph> listen! She even placed herself in the way of his
                     companionship at length; yet she continued silent, reserved, lady-like, happy
                     always—but she exhibited no pointed outward signs of being especially pleased
                     with the English gentleman's devotions.</p>
                  <p>During the passage through the Straits, the weather became uneven at first, and
                     finally boisterous, rendering the invalid uncomfortably seasick; when much of
                     his daughter's time was occupied at her father's berth-side. They had left
                     Singapore behind them, and had doubled Cape Romania; and upon coming out into
                     the China Sea, the prospect had not greatly improved. The physician was
                     constantly with old Rajab—patient, obliging and sympathetic, amid the
                     sufferer's trials, and certainly did all in his power to alleviate him, and
                     give him ease; his efforts were assiduous and constant, and in some measure
                     palliated his distress; but he could not cure the Hindoo's disease.</p>
                  <p>The rough weather which they took off the Cape, increased, as they veered to
                     the northward again. The rain fell heavily, and the crew of the Sea Gull
                     scarcely knew what dry clothes were, for several days together. The top-gallant
                     sails had not been loosed since they entered the Straits, and the topsails were
                     close-reefed as they worked up to the north. The wind at last came out at the
                     eastward, and the heavy sea went down around the barque with a long roll,
                     against the ochre sky, from daybreak to eight-bells in the evening.</p>
                  <p>When the middle watch reached the deck again, a heavy blackness had overspread
                     the heavens away to windward, an ominous sight in that latitude. The mate stood
                     near the hatch of the half-deck, looking earnestly out at the prospect, which
                     his nautical experience told him was no very agreeable one, at that moment—and,
                     as they had thus far experienced so fortunate a run, he had hoped to have
                     reached Hong Kong without encountering this sort of scene. "But it isn't
                        <emph>all</emph> sunshine, Mr. Hargreve, at sea," he said, turning to the
                     lieutenant, who approached him, at this moment.</p>
                  <p>The mate turned away from the weather bulwark, where he had stood for a moment
                     looking at the rising thickness. The certain precursor of the heavy squall
                     could now be distinctly seen, in the long foamy white line that fringed the
                     dark mass of clouds, and the hurricane was coming down upon the barque with
                     fearful fury!</p>
                  <p>The orders went quickly forth from the strong lungs of the officer of the deck
                     to take in sail; and very suddenly all was snug, and the barque was put away
                     before it with close-reefed foresail, only. The Sea Gull behaved herself
                     gallantly, however. Young Hargreve went below to encourage the passengers, and
                     to allay any fears that might be experienced by old Rajab and his daughter. He
                     found them attended by the physician, and not so much alarmed as he had
                     anticipated. Indeed the fair Katrin proved herself a capital sailor, being but
                     little sick during the whole voyage!</p>
                  <p>During the night, the barque was under as little sail as was necessary to keep
                     her steady only, and at daylight, at the call of the second watch, the
                     blackness began to disperse, the sea went down rapidly, and a clear sky opened
                     to windward, as the breeze hauled round to the southwest once more. All hands
                     were called, the royal masts were sent up, the topsails and topgallant sails
                     were loosed, and sheeted home, the royals were flung out, the jib set, and the
                     Sea Gull flew on before the sharp gale, at a twelve-knot rate, towards her
                     destination.</p>
                  <p>They soon got pleasant weather, again—easy days and quiet nights attended them
                     to the end of their passage; and as they moved happily and rapidly on, the
                     chess-board was brought into requisition once more, the young Hindoo girl
                     appeared gay and happy, Hargreve relaxed no particle of his attentions to her,
                     old Rajab was temporarily easier, and the prospect was exceedingly agreeable to
                     all parties on board. Together er, seated upon the quarter-deck of the Sea
                     Gull, beneath the smiles of the warm sun, and mutually enjoying the bracing
                     effect of the grateful breezes, Hargreve and Katrin would sit, and watch the
                     sportive playfulness of the dolphin, as it flitted about the vessel, or exclaim
                     at the dexterity of the curious flying-fish, as that singular piscatorial
                     phenomenon would spring from the waves, and dart along, yards over the water's
                     surface, supported for the moment by its firm but gauzy wings.</p>
                  <p>George Hargreve was really a very happy young man at this time; yet he scarcely
                     realized what he was doing, or how little hope he could possibly have of
                     keeping up his newly-made acquaintance with the daughter of the princely
                     merchant of Calcutta. He did not tarry to reflect, however! His time was
                     continually occupied in his endeavors to entertain the beautiful Katrin, whom
                     he had become very fond of, without any reference to the disparity in their
                     fortunes, the usually insurmountable barrier to their union on account of her
                     religion, or the palpable indifference of old Rajab towards him; and last,
                     though by no means least in importance, the total lack of reciprocation, on the
                     part of the "peri of his thoughts," of his rapidly growing attachment to
                     her.</p>
                  <p>Hargreve even pictured to himself, often, as he went to his berth at midnight,
                     that this lovely girl might one day be his wife, perhaps! He would aim to
                     accomplish this, he thought, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">malgre</foreign> her
                     religion, he father's coldness, her "outlandish" origin—in spite of anything
                     and all things opposing combined. He would marry her—if he could—and take her
                     home to England, to his father, to Sunnyside—the daughter of the
                     merchant-prince of Hindostan.</p>
                  <p>This valiant determination on the part of the sanguine and spirited lieutenant,
                     was all very well, so far as his imaginative intents were concerned. But, as it
                     chanced that the young lady herself had not as yet been consulted, and as her
                     wealthy and bigoted heathen-parent was not over-well prepossessed in favor of
                     Englishmen, generally, it seemed more than probable, notwithstanding the
                     efforts and the disposition of Hargreve towards the lovely daughter of the
                     Hindoo millionaire, that there were yet to be, at the least, two words to this
                     proposed bargain!</p>
                  <p>None of these things entered at all into George's rather premature
                     calculations, however. He continued to watch for the smiles of his inamorata,
                     he flew to respond to her every desire or whim, he grew more and more
                     attentive, as time passed glibly along, and the land of the "celestials" hove
                     in sight, at last, ere he had made much apparent progress, and before he had
                     any shadow of encouragement—although sweet Katrin was the same gentle,
                     lady-like entrancer that she had ever been—to <emph>begin</emph> to acknowledge
                     his love for her!</p>
                  <p>The anchorage off Canton was near at hand, at last. Macao was behind, and the
                     main land was near by. The anchors of the Sea Gull were cleared, and hung free
                     over the bows by the cat-stoppers. The cables had been duly bent on, and ample
                     coils of chain lay along the deck, for the mooring. The boats were got ready to
                     lower away, the light sails were stored, the booms had been rigged in, the
                     foresail was hauled up, and, as she now rounded to gracefully to her mooring
                     ground, her headway was checked, a plash was heard, and the Sea Gull rode safe
                     at anchor in the harbor of Canton.</p>
                  <p>Old Rajab had not been on deck for ten days. As soon as he was informed that
                     the voyage was at an end, he came valiantly up to survey the prospect around
                     him. But he was pale and dispirited. His journey to China, he feared, would be
                     a fruitless undertaking, so far as the recovery of his health was concerned. He
                     gazed about at the junks and other curiosities that presented themselves near
                     the vessel's side, and then he looked at the shores beyond. He did not fancy
                     the appearance of things very much, and heartily wished himself safely at home
                     once more.</p>
                  <p>But Katrin came, with smiling face and encouraging words, and his physician
                     reassured him, now that they were near his home, where he could obtain the
                     medicines he required, that there would be little delay in his recuperation.
                     And, as the doctor went ashore to procure lodgings for the Indiaman's family
                     and retinue, old Rajab shook his head, and said to George, "Meestur Hargriv, I
                     no like dis Shinees country, no, no!"</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE CITY OF CANTON.</head>
                  <p>THE learned Chinese physicians—who, from their entire aversion to the
                     dissection of the human body, can know but little of its actual formation,
                     notwithstanding their high character in the art of healing—contend that but two
                     main principles enter into the composition of the natural life, to wit;
                        <foreign xml:lang="CHI">yin</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="CHI"
                        >yang,</foreign> which signify darkness and light. Yin is their moisture,
                     and yang is the internal or vital heat of the system; when these two are
                     separated, they claim that pulsation must cease, and life become extinct. Thus,
                     with their medical knowledge narrowed to this point, to which all their theory
                     tends, they undertake to cure every description of disease, no matter what it
                     may chance to be—confident of success in their principles, and acting in
                     accordance with the above simple premises. If the pulses, of which they contend
                     there are as many as there are organs, muscles, nerves, etc., in the body—if
                     any of these are disarranged, sickness is indicated and is sure to follow the
                     demonstration. They claim that there are twelve minor canals, which proceed
                     from and are nourished by six original sources, or passages, in the human
                     frame; and through the action of these, life and strength are maintained. The
                     physician who undertook to effect a cure of poor Rajab's malady, was one of
                     these learned and erudite men, who in all probability never knew what was his
                     complaint; even—though he meant to aid him, to the best of his abilities.</p>
                  <p>At Canton, this man's fame was a very notable affair; and, when the party
                     arrived there, it was quickly bruited about that Chang Emmu, the "great
                     medicine man" had brought a nabob home with him from Hindostan, in search of
                     his lost health. It was a long "feather in the doctor's beaver," this fact! The
                     doctor had reached his home, however, and the opportunity was now afforded him
                     to exhibit his skill, and to make his fortune, if he succeeded in his
                     plans.</p>
                  <p>The city of Canton proved to be a place of rare interest to our little party,
                     and Hargreve was especially pleased with it. The approach to it from Whampoa
                     Reach is a scene long to be remembered; and while both Katrin and the
                     supercargo were delighted with the prospect around them, even old Rajab
                     admitted that it was very picturesque. The long ranges of banyan trees that
                     graced the outsides of the high forts, were very attractive in their
                     appearance; the mountains, cultivated to their very tops; the lofty pagodas,
                     rising up into the air far above all else, the curious bamboo cottages that
                     dotted the landscape the immense quantity of duck-boats, junks and other
                     curious craft that lined the river's edge, all literally alive with hordes of
                     dusky human beings, of every age; all these things were new to the eyes of the
                     strangers, and they enjoyed the scene right heartily.</p>
                  <p>Then there were the vegetable boats, with their little portable herb gardens
                     suspended alongside; their fish tanks for preserving alive, or fattening the
                     finny tribes they secured—their long bamboo poultry-cages, and then came the
                     police-boats, with fifteen to twenty oars at each side; and then the <foreign
                        xml:lang="CHI">san-pans,</foreign> or fresh fruit boats; the greater junks,
                     with the enormous all-seeing-eye painted upon their prows; then the fishing
                     craft, with their aquatic birds which are trained to take the unwary fishes
                     from the stream; the big war junks, gaily painted, with their series of cabins,
                     one over the other, high up across the poop; and finally, as they reached the
                     shore, the grand chaos of homely junks and punts, crossing and twisting and
                     crowding upon each other, from every possible direction, served to make up a
                     scene such as once seen can never be forgotten, and which only exists upon the
                     Canton River.</p>
                  <p>The dense population of China is well known. But the most closely packed body
                     of living, breathing humanity, on the globe, is found within the confines of
                     the city of Canton. The motley crowd that amuses the eye of the European in
                     this tour, is comprised of natives of all trades, mechanics, artisans,
                     food-venders, poultry sellers, pedlers, merchants, mandarins, boatmen, women
                     and children; jugglers, thugs, thieves and sharpers; all mixed up in one dense
                     moving multitude. While the ear is saluted, there, upon all sides, with gong
                        <emph>music,</emph> horns, gabbling, screaming, yelling, bustling and every
                     conceivable clamor, from the tongues and voices of a million of dirty swarthy
                     barbarians! Such was the throng our travellers met, on their entrance into
                     Canton.</p>
                  <p>After being bustled ashore, sedan-chairs were procured for the party, who were
                     slowly borne along the narrow and crowded margin of the city, to the residence
                     of a friendly <foreign xml:lang="CHI">hong</foreign> or merchant, whom Chang
                     Emmu had induced, for liberal pay, to entertain his patient and suite. The
                     street upon which they found themselves located, was narrow and filthy, but it
                     was the best to he had, and of necessity, outside the city walls, as that; no
                     foreigners being permitted to locate within those bounds.</p>
                  <p>The location selected, though agreeably enough to the doctor, was terrible in
                     the estimation of old Rajab. He had left Calcutta, because the dampness of the
                     climate had injured him evidently! Here he was now surrounded, enveloped, with
                     a hazy, malarious atmosphere, heightened in its offensiveness by the stench
                     from the low grounds about him, which were washed and befouled by the drains
                     and waste-water from the town proper!</p>
                  <p>He contrived, through the united efforts of Chang Emmu, and his own veekel, who
                     backed their application with a goodly show of genuine soucie-silver, at last,
                     to secure a habitable dwelling house, a mile farther up the river, but still,
                     though he "changed the place, he kept the pain."</p>
                  <p>In vain did the medical man, whose fame rung through the region of Canton and
                     Hong Kong, apply his nostrums and administer his "magic" concoctions. Old Rajab
                     failed, clearly and indisputably; and there were none to help him, none to save
                     him, even in that wonderful land. Everything that money could obtain, and
                     silver will bring almost anything, in China, except health, to the purchaser!
                     everything was obtained for the wealthy Rajab. His daughter clung to him, and
                     did her duty, to the very last degree. But Rajab did not improve in his bodily
                     health.</p>
                  <p>In the meantime, young Hargreve was busy with the affairs of the Sea Gull.
                     Through the management of the hong whom Rajab had introduced to him, soon after
                     their arrival at Canton, he disposed of his opium at a round figure. His other
                     commodities found a ready sale, in exchange for costly shawls, silks, ivory,
                     teas, sandal-wood, tortoise-shell, etc., with which he freighted the Sea Gull
                     once more, for the return voyage to Calcutta and England.</p>
                  <p>He managed the vessel's affairs with well-judged commercial skill, so that he
                     saw the prospect of an enormous profit accruing upon the venture they had made.
                     His own interest in the cargo amounted, it will be remembered, to some eleven
                     thousand pounds sterling, the funds for which had been shipped by Mr. Maitland,
                     at Southampton. At the invoice rates, after allowing for current and
                     prospective expenses of voyage, interest and incidentals, his share of the
                     return cargo would yield him nearly three times this sum. And this would be but
                     his first year's work! With ordinary success in disposing of his goods, at
                     home, this sum would be largely increased in his favor. Besides this, Hargreve
                     had realized over twenty-five thousand taels in value, about six thousand
                     pounds sterling profit, upon his outward share of the voyage. And he had now
                     been absent from home less than nine<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC5953-00000019"/>
                     months. He saw his way clear to save his father from bankruptcy, already, and
                     joy filled his heart at this grateful prospect.</p>
                  <p>In the midst of his business, he found leisure to visit Rajab and his daughter,
                     often, and he was pained to observe the change that occurred, from day to day,
                     in the old man's appearance. Some of the soodras he brought with him from
                     Calcutta had run away, and the others were continually quarrelling with the
                     coolies of the neighborhood; so that what with his malady, his fractious
                     servants, his enormous expenses in Canton, and the miserable prospect before
                     him in regard to the hoped-for recovery of his health, he was fain to declare
                     himself heartily sick of the experiment, and to urge the early departure of
                     Hargreve from that odious place.</p>
                  <p>"My father tires of Canton," said Katrin to the lieutenant, one day. "Will you
                     not soon return to the west?"</p>
                  <p>"Almost directly, dear Katrin," said Hargreve.</p>
                  <p>"Will you tarry at our own home?"</p>
                  <p>"But a few days, Katrin."</p>
                  <p>"And then?"</p>
                  <p>"For England, my native land, again."</p>
                  <p>"When will you return?"</p>
                  <p>"Whither, Katrin?"</p>
                  <p>"To the Hindoo land?"</p>
                  <p>"I cannot say. Perhaps I shall never be able to visit these shores, again."</p>
                  <p>"<emph>What!</emph>" exclaimed Katrin; "never, <emph>never?</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"Haply not, Katrin."</p>
                  <p>"Then you will not <emph>go!</emph>" said the girl, quickly and sharply. There
                     was a singularly spirited tone in this remark, that astonished Hargreve,
                     exceedingly. The dark eye of the houri shone with unexampled splendor, and as
                     she gazed into his face, he felt strangely affected by the spell, or whatever
                     it was.</p>
                  <p>"Do you not see," she continued, "that my father is dying?"</p>
                  <p>"I hope it is not so bad as that, Katrin, "responded George, kindly.</p>
                  <p>"Yet it is so, Hargreve. Katrin will one day be alone in the great world. Will
                     you go to your home in the west, and not return hither?"</p>
                  <p>"I will return, if Katrin wills it, surely," said Hargreve.</p>
                  <p>"<emph>You will not go,</emph>" said the Hindoo girl, emphatically, once more.
                     "My father's bungalow is empty at home. He would return to it, alive, if he
                     can. When shall we depart from this vile place?"</p>
                  <p>"Within three weeks, Katrin."</p>
                  <p>"Do not permit another moon to wane over our heads in this country, Hargreve,"
                     continued Katrin, earnestly. "Poor Sedd Rajab is very ill!"</p>
                  <p>"I have not been an idle observer of the state of his health here, Katrin; and
                     I will expedite the departure of the barque, forthwith," said the lieutenant,
                     in reply.</p>
                  <p>There was a good deal yet to be done before the vessel could be got away again,
                     however. Her outward cargo had been disposed of, but her home freight was yet
                     to be shipped. Everything was urged forward with despatch, however, and in the
                     meantime, Hargreve employed what leisure he could command between sight-seeing
                     and his Calcutta friends. Once or twice, Katrin condescended to accompany the
                     supercargo abroad, but only for a few hours at a time.</p>
                  <p>Old Rajab was very nervous and watchful, evidently.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE FEAST OF THE LANTERNS.</head>
                  <p>AT the beginning of the new year in France, a grand universal sort of <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">fete</foreign> is observed throughout that country, which
                     will be recollected by those who have chanced to be there in the season, and
                     which is designated the "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Fete de Bon bons.</foreign>"
                     At the commencement of each new year in China, a similar demonstration or
                     entertainment takes place among the celestials, which is known as the
                        <emph>Feast of Lanterns.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the street appropriated to the stores of the lantern-sellers of Canton, are
                     to be found the most gorgeous and attractive exhibitions of all the trades
                     known in China, ordinarily. Here may be seen every variety of this favorite
                     Chinese bauble, of all conceivable colors, shapes, and sizes, from the large
                     and costly four feet pagoda lantern, down to the simple horn or paper ones, at
                     six cents each. Some are showily painted, others are trimmed with gold or
                     silver fringe, others are embroidered richly, and command from fifty to two
                     hundred dollars each. At night it is the custom for the coolies to go before
                     their masters, and carry a lantern of some description, upon the outside of
                     which are emblazoned his name and title. Thus the lantern trade is a very
                     important branch of the local business of Canton.</p>
                  <p>Upon the occasion of the annual return of the great feast spoken of, this trade
                     reaps its harvest. At this time, it is the habit of the people of all classes
                     to purchase lanterns, as the French do their <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >bon-bons,</foreign> and as the young people of this country do
                     "valentines," for universal distribution among their families and friends; and,
                     as every one joins in this performance, from the poorest coolie to the most
                     wealthy mandarin, the consequence is, there being so great a people to supply,
                     that an immense quantity of lanterns are demanded for these occasions.</p>
                  <p>These presents are formed of all shapes, such as of birds, beasts, fishes,
                     etc., and are really unique and pretty affairs in their way. At night they find
                     their way into the streets, and being all illuminated, the effect is not only
                     curious, but really forms a magnificent show. The streets are soon thronged
                     with the moving mass, each person supporting his lighted lanterns in front of
                     his shop or dwelling, where the crowds congregate. The general effect is very
                     fine, as may be supposed.</p>
                  <p>On the evening of this feast, Hargreve was present at the residence of Rajab,
                     where a few stray <foreign xml:lang="CHI">hongs</foreign> and English residents
                     convened to pass a pleasant hour together, after enjoying the scene out of
                     doors. Katrin did the honors of her father's house with becoming grace, when on
                     a sudden, old Rajab was astounded at the proposal of one of his wealthy guests
                     to <emph>purchase</emph> his daughter! Not appreciating this sort of thing
                     exactly, and being unaware of the custom in China which prevails as to buying
                     and selling<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC5953-00000020"/> pretty women, the Hindoo
                     took umbrage, and felt himself deeply aggrieved. An explanation followed, which
                     proved satisfactory, however; Hargreve remarking that when the young lady was
                     fairly "in the market," <emph>he</emph> would bid higher for her than any of
                     the pig-tailed gentry of the Chinese empire! Mr. Joss looked at the young
                     barbarian, askance, and then turned to the lady again—as if still determined
                     upon a fair examination of her charms. When he came to see her feet, so gross
                     in comparison to the Chinaman's beau ideal of womanly perfection, he turned
                     away content! <emph>He</emph> had been taught to believe that if a lady's feet
                     were large enough to permit her to walk upon them, she would not answer his
                     purpose. And so Katrin escaped!</p>
                  <p>Among the annoyances experienced by the invalid while residing at his new
                     house, were the continual visits of the beggars of the town, who flocked around
                     him, craving alms, and finally stealing whatever they could lay hands upon.
                     There was no help for this, either. An appeal to the acquaintances he had made
                     there, was received only with derision! And he was compelled to submit to these
                     troubles, as long as he remained in the place.</p>
                  <p>He felt that he had brought his malady to a precious poor market to be disposed
                     of. At home, he had contracted his bodily trouble from the unevenness of the
                     climate of Calcutta and vicinity. He found—from irksome experience—that there
                     were worse places in the East than India; and, once safely back again, he
                     promised himself that he would remain where he was, and if he must die, he
                     would at least have the satisfaction of departing among his kindred, and
                     surrounded by those who were not so bad as he found the famed "celestials."</p>
                  <p>Hargreve finally informed Rajab that the barque was nearly ready to return
                     again. He offered the old Hindoo his sympathy for the mistake he had made in
                     confiding in the wandering Chinese doctor, and hoped that, at least, he had and
                     would enjoy some share of benefit from his sea-voyage, and the change of scene
                     he had experienced. To all this, the old man shook his head, and muttered "no
                     good, no good! Shinaman, Englis-man, Frenchman all alike! No good—no good!"
                     This was not over-flattering to the lieutenant's ambition, but he did not
                     oppose the father of Katrin in anything that he advanced.</p>
                  <p>Everything being finally in readiness, a few days after this conversation, the
                     Hindoo got on board, the anchor was tripped, the wind blew gently from the
                     north, and the Sea Gull cleared from Canton, for Calcutta and Liverpool, with
                     Rajab, his daughter, Mez Hobad the veekel and but three soodras; all the rest
                     having been enticed away by the coolies of the town.</p>
                  <p>The barque was heavily freighted with one of the best selected cargoes that
                     ever went out of the port of Canton. The Hindoo merchant was not able to be
                     about the vessel much, and he was watched and tended, from time to time, by
                     Hobad, his daughter and young Hargreve.</p>
                  <p>He noticed the attentions of the latter but very little, however. Perhaps it
                     was from his natural dislike to Englishmen, or it might have been because he
                     was so sick. Hargreve did not inquire, nor did he pretend to observe that his
                     care of the old man, for many long hours during the return voyage, was not
                     appreciated by him.</p>
                  <p>"He will know me better, one of these days," said George, to himself. "He may
                     live to think more kindly of us 'outside barbarians,' yet."</p>

                  <p>IN the old departments of Bohpaul, Doabe and Bundlekund, as also in some other
                     states of Hindostan, and among the dependencies of the British government in
                     India, there exists a sort of secret club or gang of miserable beings, known as
                        <foreign xml:lang="HIN">Thugs.</foreign> This order has been well known in
                     the East for centuries, and their diabolical pursuits are the terror of the
                     regions which they infest. Even at this day, the efforts of the English
                     colonial government are entirely powerless for the suppression of these
                     wretches, who are too cunning to be trapped, too well versed in crime and
                     cheatery to place themselves often within the reach of their enemies, and too
                     powerful, as a body, to be destroyed by all the military force in her majesty's
                     Indo-British possessions.</p>
                  <p>So successful has this race of demons been in their brutal and lawless
                     occupation, and such is the <emph>charm</emph> that seems to attach to the name
                     of this order in Hindostan, that, among the older Portuguese and French
                     residents of the country, as well as among English subjects, who have fled from
                     their own lands under the ban of governmental displeasure, and who have not
                     succeeded in the East by pursuing any honest calling, there is found, now and
                     then, an adventurous rascal, who assumes the name and the profession of a
                        <foreign xml:lang="HIN">thug,</foreign> and who preys upon the people
                     whenever and wherever he can make his trade profitable.</p>
                  <p>With the original race of Thugs, the commission of crimes—such as murder,
                     robbery, arson, and the like, forms a part of their heathen religion! They
                     commit these acts as a sort of sacrifice to their wooden deities; and, among
                     them all, whether they pretend to this or not, murders and robberies are not
                     looked upon at all as criminal acts. With their imitators—the spurious
                     thugs—the case is different; many of them assuming the name, only, and
                     confining their operations to thieving, robbing, and ordinary plundering; but
                     eschewing murder, except in self-defence, in their conflicts.</p>
                  <p>This latter class occasionally disguise themselves as jugglers, mendicants, or
                     faquirs, and enter the cities, where they are pretty certain to carry away
                     booty sufficient to reward them for the undertaking, in some shape or another.
                     They thus impose upon the weak or unwary, and profit, often, largely by this
                     sort of speculation.</p>
                  <p>There came into the city of Calcutta, one evening, from the interior, a poorly
                     dressed man, who jabbered in a gibberish that nobody could understand, and who
                     sought for alms. He made those with whom he communicated comprehend that he was
                     very poor and needed aid. So common was beggary among the people there, that
                     little notice was taken of him, and he wandered about from place to place,
                     apparently in a suffering condition. This man had concealed about his dress,
                     however, the value of near a hundred gold Bombay rupees, and he was in reality
                     a spurious thug, who came to town for plunder, or to search for a future
                     opportunity to carry out such designs as he might hatch up during his stay
                     among the nabobs. The wife of Sedd Rajab was living alone, at his bungalow,
                     with only a few soodra attendants, and Zem Judder, as he called himself<pb
                        n="42-43" xml:id="VAC5953-00000021"/> self, found his way to this house,
                     where he craved charity.</p>
                  <p>Zem amused the servants with many of his tricks in sleight of hand, at which he
                     was very dexterous, and when he had gone, a small silver tankard and the lady's
                     watch had disappeared! Search was instituted, but neither Zem, nor tankard, nor
                     watch, could be found in all Calcutta! Zem had succeeded so easily that he
                     changed his costume, disguised himself as a soodra, and came again, some time
                     afterwards, to try his luck once more.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile, the Sea Gull had had a pleasant voyage from Canton, and now made the
                     harbor of Calcutta, again, with her passengers safe, though the invalid was not
                     so sound as when he left home a few months previously. Rajab had certainly
                     changed for the worse, and his old friends saw that he was fast going out. But
                     he was far more cheerful on reaching Calcutta, than he was abroad. He was much
                     better contented, and though he now turned his entire attention (under medical
                     advice) to the attempted eradication of his serious trouble, still he got but
                     little actual relief. Shortly after his return, the mendicant in his soodra
                     disguise again visited the old merchant's bungalow.</p>
                  <p>This time he spoke in the Hindoo tongue, with a broken accent, but it was
                     evident he had been long a resident of that country, from his manners and
                     knowledge of the language. He asked for employment, and he was turned over to
                     Rajab himself.</p>
                  <p>"What can you do?" asked the merchant, addressing him in his own dialect.</p>
                  <p>"Anything, all things, master," said Zem, quickly.</p>
                  <p>"And what, first?"</p>
                  <p>"You are sick. I came from beyond Delhi, where the sacred waters of the Ganges
                     first buble from mother earth. I bear with me a charm for invalids. I can cure
                     your malady."</p>
                  <p>"How knew you of my illness?"</p>
                  <p>"Are you not ill?"</p>
                  <p>"I question <emph>you.</emph> Answer, first."</p>
                  <p>"Then it matters nothing. Bhudud told me."</p>
                  <p>"And who is Bhudud?"</p>
                  <p>"Bhudud! Not know Bhudud, the healer? Monstrous—Sedd Rajab! I do not wonder in
                     that you are ill," said the disguised thug, with well feigned astonishment.</p>
                  <p>"Then, if Bhudud informed you of my sickness, did he tell you what is my
                     malady?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes."</p>
                  <p>"Name it."</p>
                  <p>"For how many rupees, good master?" said Zem.</p>
                  <p>"Count them yourself."</p>
                  <p>"Say an hundred, then," continued Zem.</p>
                  <p>"Tell me of my complaint, and you shall double that down in gold," replied
                     Rajab.</p>
                  <p>The deceiver looked at Rajab's palm, then peered into his eye, then placed his
                     ear to the merchant's heart, and finally bade him thrust out his tongue. To all
                     of which the superstitious Hindoo quietly and patiently submitted.</p>
                  <p>The thug then took a piece of goat-skin from his vestment, called for a lamp,
                     placed it in the flame, and carefully collected its crispy ashes. Over this, he
                     mumbled some stupid and unintelligible incantations, and replied:</p>
                  <p>"Bhudud answers."</p>
                  <p>"What says Bhudud?"</p>
                  <p>"Bhudud says it is cancer in the stomach."</p>
                  <p>Rajab had suspected this, and had mentioned it in his household, some days
                     previously.</p>
                  <p>"Can Bhudud destroy it?" asked Rajab, in utter amazement at this
                     demonstration.</p>
                  <p>"No. But his servant can."</p>
                  <p>Poor Rajab was convinced! He had feared that this was his trouble, and now that
                     Bhudud declared it to be so, through his representative before him, he no
                     longer doubted for a moment. Such was his superstition and his ignorance!</p>
                  <p>He paid down the two hundred rupees, instanter, and gladly put himself into the
                     hands of this wonder-working man. The impudent thug pocketed the generous fee,
                     and went away nominally to provide medicines for his patient—but really to
                     concoct some new plan to rob the nabob, further. The next day, a valuable
                     diamond broach, of great beauty, was missing. The pin had found its way into
                     the "strong box" of the itinerant medicine-man; who returned again with his
                     boluses and his decoctions, to destroy the cancer he had so accurately
                     described.</p>
                  <p>For three days, he came and went, no shadow of suspicion resting upon him or
                     his vaunted skill; until one evening he entered, and found young Hargreve—an
                     Englishman—present.</p>
                  <p>Their eyes met, the thug started, but Hargreve had never seen him before, and
                     did not understand the sensation that was so suddenly caused, apparently, by
                     the glance he gave him.</p>
                  <p>But Zem Judder soon after departed from the bungalow of Rajab, promising to
                     return on the following day, at the same hour.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
                  <head type="sub">A SINGULAR ACCIDENT.</head>
                  <p>THE bigotry of Sedd Rajab was only equalled by his superstitious notions upon
                     subjects of mystery, and upon his heathen religion. He now honestly believed
                     that the rascal who had him in hand, was sent by the good spirit Bhudud, to
                     save him! And he was a rich pigeon for the spurious thug to pluck. Rajab had
                     never permitted young Hargreve to approach him familiarly enough to allow the
                     Englishman to have any influence with him, and consequently, though the
                     lieutenant was as suspicious of the power of this man, as he had been of the
                     other doctor, he could not advise with Rajab on the folly of employing him an
                     hour. Besides this, the old Hindoo had now got to be so sick, that he had
                     become alarmed—and he suffered no opportunity to pass by him, whereby he could
                     hope for obtaining relief from his trouble.</p>
                  <p>The supercargo was on his way to the river, to go on board his vessel late in
                     the evening, and, wrapt in deep thought, he turned into a by-street to shorten
                     his way to the boat that awaited him, when he suddenly fell forward into a
                     cavity that had been left open in the street, and plunged downward, some six or
                     seven feet deep, upon a pile of stones and timber. His fall was heavy, and he
                     was temporarily stunned; but he soon came to himself, and cried aloud for
                     assistance, for he found himself in great pain, and was unable to rise at
                     all.</p>
                  <p>He was taken out of the trap that had so carelessly been neglected, and upon
                     getting him where he could be seen, it was found that his left leg was badly
                     broken below the knee, and he was otherwise sadly bruised, in the head and
                     shoulders.</p>
                  <p>The scene was an awful one to Hargreve, for he was suffering the most dreadful
                     pains, and he could not possibly be taken on board the barque, in his present
                     situation, where there was no surgeon to set the limb, or physician to care for
                     him. He mentioned the name of Rajab, and it was determined to remove him to the
                     Hindoo's house, at once, where medical aid could be had, at any rate. Half an
                     hour after he had left the old man, the litter upon which he lay, utterly
                     helpless, was borne into Rajab's bungalow by the men who rescued him.</p>
                  <p>The astonishment of the Hindoo merchant was great, and his mutterings direful,
                     when he was informed of the circumstances that had thus thrust the Englishman
                     under his roof; but there was no help for it. Various and sundry considerations
                     prevented him from objecting to his remaining there—and he thought, naturally,
                     of the boy's kindness to himself, he remembered old Maitland, who had
                     introduced Hargreve to him, he recollected the intercourse that had so lately
                     passed between them, and common humanity suggested that he should look after
                     the wounded<pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC5953-00000022"/> man, at least, for the
                     present. He therefore hastily directed one of his soodras to call in the
                     nearest surgeon, who was quickly on the spot to adjust the broken limb. It
                     proved to be a compound fracture, of a bad character, and the most excruciating
                     agony followed the setting of it. But Hargreve was all nerve and stamina, and
                     he complained but little at the unfortunate accident, for which there was no
                     present remedy save patience and submission.</p>
                  <p>When Katrin came into the room, a few moments afterwards, and learned that a
                     foreigner had been found injured in the street, and was brought within her
                     father's doors, she rushed to the side of the litter where he lay, evidently in
                     deep affright. When she saw the face and form of George Hargreve stretched on
                     the pallet, her wildness was altogether alarming! And it astonished the patient
                     quite as much as it did any one else—for this was the very first demonstration
                        <emph>he</emph> had ever had on her part, that she entertained any interest
                     in him, save what common respect and civility would have suggested.</p>
                  <p>"Does he live—does he <emph>live?</emph>" she shouted, in her native tongue,
                     which Hargreve did not comprehend, of course, and the surgeon pacified her
                     directly, by informing her that he was not seriously hurt. The lieutenant did
                     not know what was said, or he might have replied, that, if the learned Hindoo
                     was at that moment suffering from a similar accident, perhaps his opinion would
                     be different, as to its seriousness! But Katrin was not satisfied. She bent
                     down over the litter, and with eyes filled with tears, she saked Hargreve in
                     English:</p>
                  <p>"What is it—what has happened?"</p>
                  <p>An explanation followed, and the surgeon proceeded to his duty. This event was
                     a peculiarly unfortunate one to the supercargo, for he would have been on his
                     way to England, in a week or ten days, but for this sad and unlooked for
                     accident. As it was, he could not now be moved, at all, for the present. He
                     dared not think of being taken on board the barque—which must very soon sail
                     for Liverpool, under any circumstances—for the motion of the vessel was an
                     insuperable objection to the healing of his broken limb, and he could not be
                     attended there, as his case really required. He was in a sad state of mind,
                     indeed, when he reflected that his bright and buoyant hopes had thus been so
                     suddenly and cruelly dashed to the earth! Still there was no possible way but
                     to submit, and his case required, too, that he should preserve the utmost
                     quiet.</p>
                  <p>As he happened to be possessed of ample means, he felt no lack of medical and
                     other attendants. Apartments were finally set aside for his convenience, in
                     Rajab's house, and he enjoyed all the comforts that could be expected, under
                     the critical and painful circumstances of his case.</p>
                  <p>The officers of the Sea Gull had been up to consult with Hargreve, two or three
                     times, in reference to what ought to be done, and to learn his pleasure
                     regarding the sailing of the vessel. He was at first too ill to confer with
                     them; but he finally saw that the interests of all concerned required that the
                     barque should sail for home—whether he could join her or not. To a proposition
                     which the patient made his surgeon, that he should be removed to the vessel, an
                     unconditional negative was instantly interposed. The surgeon and the medical
                     man both declared that it would be suicidal. And he reluctantly gave his
                     consent—his advice at length—that the Sea Gull should sail without him; while
                     he calculated that, in a few weeks at farthest, he would be able to join some
                     other homeward-bound ship, which he should do as early as practicable. The Sea
                     Gull sailed for England, therefore, and left poor Hargreve on his back,
                     surrounded by half-a-dozen copper-colored inhabitants of Calcutta.</p>
                  <p>At every possible opportunity, without reference to time or circumstances, day
                     or night, the beautiful Katrin flitted about the weary pillow of the sufferer.
                     Her father saw much of this, and would have rebuked her—had he dared to do so.
                     But he knew the spirit of his daughter, all too well for this! She would not
                     brook it—and he was aware of this. She said but little to Hargreve, for his
                     physician would not permit his patient to converse much. But Katrin was
                     there—there by day, and by night—almost constantly in and out, as if her
                     presence with the sufferer might said in his recovery.</p>
                  <p>"The Englishman is very ill, dear father," said Katrin to her parent, a
                     fortnight after the accident.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, daughter, has he not sinned?"</p>
                  <p>"It may be, father."</p>
                  <p>"Sheva has been irritated by him."</p>
                  <p>"But Vishnu will preserve him."</p>
                  <p>"Does my Katrin pray for the barbarian?" exclaimed the old Hindoo, with
                     emphasis.</p>
                  <p>"Katrin weeps for the afflicted, and prays that Vishnu may protect the
                     stranger, father."</p>
                  <p>"Go, my daughter—go! Do not defile thy tender heart with thoughts that Vishnu
                     will not accept. Think of thy race! Remember the requirements of our sacred
                     order. I would always see thee happy, my Katrin. Peril not they peace by any
                     undue sympathy for those who can never be aught to thee and thine, but
                     strangers! Go!"</p>
                  <p>It was barely possible that the beauteous Katrin might entertain other
                     sentiments that would eventually prove paramount to these suggestions. But old
                     Rajab had set his face against the "white-faced barbarians," and he was too old
                     to relent. Katrin retired in respectful silence.</p>
                  <p>The wound that Hargreve had received was a tediously painful one, and his
                     recovery was not only doubtful, in that climate, but it was rather improbable,
                     in the opinion of those who surrounded him. Yet his constitution was naturally
                     hardy, and he felt that he should rally again, as soon as sufficient time
                     should have elapsed to allow his limb to heal. It was an exceedingly slow
                     process, however, and he was destined to a serious and fearful delay in his
                     recovery.</p>
                  <p>The attentions of Katrin were in no wise relaxed, and at length her father
                     proposed that his friend, the "representative of Bhudud," should prescribe for
                     the Englishman! Although Hargreve entertained not the slightest faith in that
                     evident impostor, yet he was willing to gratify old Rajab, and he consented to
                     confer with him.</p>
                  <p>When this worthy came to pour his "magic oil" upon the contusions that still
                     marked the lieutenant's neck and shoulders—he suddenly became deeply interested
                     at beholding a peculiar scar near the top of his right collar-bone! He halted
                     in his labors—examined this spot, curiously—peered in the sufferer's face—and
                     then desired the attendants to leave the apartment. He thought he had seen that
                     mark before—and he resolved to know who the patient was!</p>

                  <head type="sub">A STRANGE DEVELOPMENT.</head>
                  <p>WHEN the representative of the "healing Bhudud" found himself alone with George
                     Hargreve, he suddenly knelt down by his side, and in a low whisper said to the
                     invalid, in very excellent English:</p>
                  <p>"Tell me, young man, from whence do you come?"</p>
                  <p>The lieutenant was startled at the sudden transition of the mumbling, muttering
                     Hindoo (as he supposed him to be), into one of his own countrymen,
                     apparently—for there was no restraint in his speech, and his tone, his voice,
                     his actions, now, all showed the Englishman, to the life.</p>
                  <p>"Don't be alarmed, young man," he continued, "but tell me, in one word, who you
                     are, and how came you to be here?"</p>
                  <p>"What means all this?" inquired Hargreve, astonished, without offering the man
                     any reply to his questions. "How is it that you are thus native and foreigner
                     in the same breath?"</p>
                  <p>"I know," said the man, still whispering what he said, "I expected you would be
                     curious. I will explain myself to you; but first tell me, who you are, and from
                     whence you find your way hither? I can be of service to you, if you will trust
                     me. You <emph>must,</emph> young man!"</p>
                  <p>There was a singularly imperative tone in this remark, which—under other
                     circumstances—Hargreve would have quickly resented. But, as it was, he felt not
                     displeased to hear his native language pronounced, and he began to think at
                     once, that some good might come out of this discovery. So, after a moment, he
                     said:</p>
                  <p>"My name is Hargreve."</p>
                  <p>"Hargreve?" repeated the other—"Hargreve?"</p>
                  <p>"George Hargreve."</p>
                  <p>"And you came from—"</p>
                  <p>"Southampton, England."</p>
                  <p>"Did you ever know one Marlock, there?"</p>
                  <p>The lieutenant reflected, but could remember no such person.</p>
                  <p>"Did you never hear of Thomas Marlock, of Newbury?"</p>
                  <p>"No, not to my knowledge."</p>
                  <p>"Do you know of one Heath—a Scotchman, who dwelt in the region of the Isle of
                     Wight, many years ago?"</p>
                  <p>"Heath?" exclaimed Hargreve, quickly, "do you mean Barney Heath, as he was
                     called, a sailor?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, yes; the same, I presume."</p>
                  <p>"Yes. I have heard of <emph>him,</emph> as a smuggler, and a bad man," said
                     Hargreve, modestly.</p>
                  <p>"He was not so bad as circumstances made him seem, sir. Heath was a bold and
                     sturdy fellow, and I thought you would be likely to have heard of him, if you
                     hail from Southampton."</p>
                  <p>The man halted—then continued:</p>
                  <p>"You didn't know him much, then?"</p>
                  <p>"No, not much. He is now dead," said Hargreve.</p>
                  <p>"Barney <emph>dead?</emph> Poor fellow! Where did he die? And when, sir?"</p>
                  <p>"Less than a year since, he was detected by the government cutter on the
                     southern station, while he was running some contraband goods ashore, and was
                     wounded in the affray which followed his discovery and arrest."</p>
                  <p>"Was he taken?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, and his vessel was confiscated."</p>
                  <p>"Who commanded the cutter?"</p>
                  <p>"Lieutenant George Hargreve, of Southampton," said the young man,
                     instantly.</p>
                  <p>"<emph>You!</emph>" exclaimed the impostor, astounded.</p>
                  <p>The brief account which had thus been given him, intensely interested the
                     disguised stranger, evidently; and he was desirous to know more of his native
                     country—which he had not seen for many a long, long day.</p>
                  <p>"Did you never hear of a clothes-dealer in your neighborhood, by the name of
                     Glessin? Henry Glessin?" inquired the stranger, after a moment's thought.</p>
                  <p>Hargreve thought the name sounded like one he <emph>had</emph> heard at some
                     time or other. But his recollection was indistinct in regard to it. The
                     pretended medical man turned down the dress of his patient, examined his arm
                     again, and said:</p>
                  <p>"Hargreve, do you recollect how you received this scar?"</p>
                  <p>"It was caused by the knife of your <emph>friend,</emph> Barney Heath, when I
                     closed with him," said Hargreve, sharply.</p>
                  <p>"I do not mean that," said the other. "This, <emph>this,</emph>" and he placed
                     his finger upon the old mark that Heath had spoken of, and by which that worthy
                     had recognized the son of Sophia Glessin. The lieutenant could not answer his
                     question—and said he did not know what had caused it.</p>
                  <p>"But I can tell you, then," remarked the man. "I know! I have seen that
                     shoulder before."</p>
                  <p>"<emph>You</emph>—where?"</p>
                  <p>"At home, young man!"</p>
                  <p>"Then you are an Englishman, by birth?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes. My history is a painful one, and cannot now be given you—but you shall
                     know it—by all means, soon, <emph>soon,</emph> George Hargreve.</p>
                  <p>The scar you bear upon your arm, your <emph>father</emph> gave you, when you
                     was but a child. It was an accident, he did not mean you harm."</p>
                  <p>"My father!" exclaimed George, amazed—"you must be at sea, my friend, now. How
                     did this come about, since you seem to know what I do not know at all."</p>
                  <p>"You could scarcely remember it. You was but a little past two years old. Your
                     father came home one night, flushed with wine, and dispirited from the
                     embarrassments under which he was then laboring, in his trade; when he found a
                     bailiff awaiting his coming. The officer attempted to arrest him, when he drew
                     a knife in his defence, declaring he would not be taken, like a felon to
                     prison, for an unavoidable debt he had contracted. The officer advanced towards
                     him, your mother, who was at that moment holding you in her arms, sprang
                     forward at seeing his uplifted hand clutching a knife, and as the two men
                     closed, his hand fell and <emph>you</emph> received the wound intended for his
                     assailant!"</p>
                  <p>"This is very ridiculous," said Hargreve, when the man stopped again; "a mere
                     romance certainly. My father is a mild and inoffensive man, and could not, I am
                     sure, have been placed in any circumstances, by pecuniary distress, that would
                     have spurred him to such a desperate point as this. You must be in error—"</p>
                  <p>"I am certain of it—certain, young man."</p>
                  <p>"Then I insist that you are misinformed."</p>
                  <p>"That cannot be," said the stranger.</p>
                  <p>"And why not, pray?"</p>
                  <p>"Because I was present when you received that cut, as truly as I now relate it
                     to you!" replied the man, instantly.</p>
                  <p>"How could that be?"</p>
                  <p>"It <emph>was</emph> so, I say. You shall know more of this on the morrow.
                     Thank the good God that I have so mysteriously met you! Remember that no hint
                     passes your lips, that you know aught of me, save what I <emph>seem</emph> to
                     be to this household, for your life, George Hargreve, and for mine! I will
                     satisfy you that you should be silent—silent as death itself—in reference to me
                     in this place! Will you promise?"</p>
                  <p>The lieutenant bowed, nervously.</p>
                  <p>"To-morrow, I will see you again; and will again prescribe for you. They are
                     coming now; silence and ignorance of me or mine, remember!"</p>
                  <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC5953-00000024"/>
                  <p>The door opened, and Katrin entered. The stranger was just then covering up his
                        <emph>patient's</emph> shoulders. Leaving a small horn of liquid, which he
                     desired to have the contusions washed with, he pressed the hand of George
                     Hargreve, significantly, and departed from the bungalow, in silence.</p>
                  <p>This singular and altogether unanticipated scene left the supercargo something
                     to think about. He could not believe the statement possible, that he had just
                     now heard, and yet there were parts of it that corresponded with his own
                     knowledge of home affairs. The man was evidently one of his countrymen—and he
                     pondered curiously upon the account he had given him, while he said not a word
                     about any discoveries he had made, for the present.</p>

                  <head type="sub">HENRY GLESSIN.</head>
                  <p>AT an early hour on the next day, much earlier than he had been in the habit of
                     calling at Rajab's house, the medicine man made his appearance, to consult with
                     his wealthy patient, and more particularly to confer with young Hargreve. The
                     impostor had passed a night of pain and remorse that none knew the cause of,
                     but himself—but his cup of bitterness was now full to the very brim! As soon as
                     he found it convenient to be alone with Hargreve, he thus addressed him:</p>
                  <p>"Young man, you listened to what I said to you on yesterday, and you doubted my
                     assertions. You are at a loss to understand the seeming mystery that surrounds
                     my statement, but it is because you do not know your own history. I will
                     enlighten you. But you must be patient, George, and silent. These walls are
                     thin, and if you exhibit astonishment at the words I now shall utter, bear in
                     mind that discovery, or suspicion, by these people here, would be fatal to you
                     and to me. Will you be silent, and listen to me, like a man?"</p>
                  <p>"I cannot comprehend the marvellous manner that you have assumed towards me,
                     and I cannot say what effect your secret, or whatever it may prove to be, will
                     have upon me. Go on, then, I will attend to your words, since you are my
                     countryman," said Hargreve, slowly.</p>
                  <p>"You are now two-and-twenty years old, George," said the stranger. "About a
                     score of years since, there dwelt in the town of Colchester, in the south of
                     England, a man whom fortune never favored much, but who was of a wayward
                     disposition, and not over-scrupulous in the means he adopted to sustain himself
                     in his calling. He was a clothier, by trade, and his business brought him into
                     contact with the sharpers and Jews of that town, who constantly over-reached
                     him in traffic, and finally, by usury and imposition, amid his need, filched
                     from him his last shilling, and left him to the tender mercies of the minions
                     of the law.</p>
                  <p>"He had acquired habits of dissipation, unfortunately, at that time, of which
                     he afterwards bitterly repented, and he got to be morose and troublesome in his
                     little household. His wife suffered from his abuse and neglect, and died at
                     last, away from her former friends and relatives, from the protection of whom
                     she had fled with this man, some five years previously. She left a child,
                     nearly three years old, to the care of its remaining parent, who was in no
                     condition properly to provide for or to protect the innocent little one. The
                     death of his wife might have been supposed to have caused that reckless man to
                     stop in his wild career, and reflect upon his future, and that of his child!
                     But he soon became<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC5953-00000025"/> came worse off than
                     ever, and his little one was neglected, and finally left to the charity of the
                     neighborhood, while the father passed his time in the company of the dissolute
                     gamblers and tipplers of the vicinity.</p>
                  <p>"A friendly man residing at Newbury, by the name of Marlock, took the infant
                     away at last, and promised to care for it. The father went from bad to worse,
                     and finally fled from his native land, to return to it no more. What
                     subsequently became of the child, the parent did not know. He wandered over the
                     earth for five long weary, toilsome years, and eventually shipped on board an
                     Indiaman bound to the East. He was no sailor, and proved a burthen on board the
                     ship. When the outward bound vessel touched at the Island of Ceylon, some four
                     months afterwards, he was left there, by some mistake or intent, and he found
                     himself among foreigners, alone and almost penniless. At length he came to this
                     vicinity; and, after a while, made himself acquainted with the manners and
                     habits of the most depraved of the Hindoo tribes, from association with whom he
                     managed to acquire a knowledge of their tricks, their language, their rites and
                     their ways in imposition. He was cunning and shrewd, and proved a worthy
                     imitator of their arts in jugglery and deception; and he is now the equal of
                     the worst of his class, at ready imposture and deceit."</p>
                  <p>"And this man—" said Hargreve.</p>
                  <p>"Is he who now addresses you!" replied the stranger.</p>
                  <p>"Your name?" demanded George.</p>
                  <p>"My name is Judder, <emph>here,</emph> young man."</p>
                  <p>"And, originally?"</p>
                  <p>"It was Henry Glessin—'sh! Do not start, but maintain your silence, while I
                     complete the few words more I have to add, in this connection."</p>
                  <p>The invalid was deeply agitated, but the impostor continued, in a whisper,
                     still, to explain himself.</p>
                  <p>"This man I have told you of, was the dissolute clothier of Colchester. Your
                     name is George—but your name is <emph>not</emph> Hargreve. This cognomen has
                     been given you since you were taken in charge by some person to whose hands
                     Henry Marlock entrusted you, evidently. You may doubt me, fear me, curse me—if
                     you will—but I declare to you that I cannot be mistaken. The scar is here—here!
                     The remembrance of that scene, which so nearly proved fatal to the babe, can
                     never be effaced from my recollection. In your eyes, I see Sophia's eyes—in
                     your frown and smile, I now detect the lineaments that stamped her comely face.
                     Again I conjure you to be calm and silent. I <emph>command</emph> it, George.
                     For your safety and for mine. The acknowledgement murders my heart, the
                     sensations of this moment, I cannot survive! Look in my face, believe what I
                     now speak to you, and prove my words, if you ever see England again. Remain as
                     you are in name. Be George Hargreve still, for your father's name was a
                     reproach, and is now forgotten. We shall, from this hour, meet as strangers.
                     Your secret may forever be locked in your own breast; but, as truly as you now
                     behold this face, as surely as you now feel the grasp of this hand, so surely
                     am <emph>I</emph> Henry Glessin, so truly <emph>your own father!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>Young Hargreve would have sprang from his pillow, regardless of his shattered
                     limb and forgetful of his pains and jeopardy, as these fearful words were
                     uttered in his ear, but the strong man pressed his hand upon the boy's chest
                     and held him down.</p>
                  <p>"Peace, boy!" he said, "peace! for your life, I say! Will it avail you aught to
                     expose yourself, and me, in this house? Silence, I repeat, and reflect an
                     instant upon the result of any demonstration, here. 'sh! I hear approaching
                     footsteps. Preserve your secret, be a man, live to do honor to your
                     foster-parents, if they live to meet you, hereafter, and forget that you are
                     otherwise than the George Hargreve you are believed to be. They come, for the
                     present, no more—silence! <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Adieu!</foreign>"</p>
                  <p>Five minutes after this sentence had been uttered, the medical man departed. On
                     the same evening, the missing ring and watch and diamond broach found their
                     way, in a package together, to Rajab's bungalow; but no one knew who brought
                     the parcel. The soodra who left it, departed without a syllable of explanation,
                     and it was never known where the jewels had been, or by whom they were
                     returned.</p>
                  <p>The doctor came and went during Rajab's continued illness, and occasionally his
                     patient would experience more or less relief. He did not seek to confer with
                     the crippled supercargo, however, and saw him again but once or twice, and then
                     only in the presence of others. He seemed stultified, or dogged in his manners,
                     and disinclined to converse, though he had, for once, stated truth! He
                        <emph>was,</emph> without question, the wilful, miserable, heartless parent
                     who had deserted his wife and child, twenty years previously, and who had been
                     a lonely and unnoticed cumberer of the earth, for so weary and unrewarded a
                     period! When he thus suddenly found his son, whom he recognized (beyond a doubt
                     in his own mind), he felt impelled to acknowledge himself; and the terrible
                     re-action on his mind tempted him to consummate what he had in his hardihood
                     never feared, but had often contemplated—his own destruction!</p>
                  <p>George Hargreve lost sight of him, and did not know what was his fate, for a
                     time. He did not yet place implicit confidence in all his assertions, though
                     there was much of probability in his statements. He resolved to keep quiet, and
                     did not expect to meet this man often, after what passed between them! He
                     deemed it prudent to preserve the affair a secret, and the subject was never
                     broached to or by him, from the moment they finally separated. When he reached
                     England—if he was so fortunate as to be able ever to do so—he would satisfy
                     himself in reference to all this, which might be true, but which he continued
                     still to doubt.</p>
                  <p>At the time the Sea Gull left Calcutta for England, the supercargo was too ill
                     to write. He enjoined it upon the officers to see his father, (as he supposed
                     Mr. Hargreve to be), and authorized the owners, through the captain of the
                     barque, to settle his affairs with him and Mr. Maitland, on their arrival in
                     Liverpool. He drew upon his owners for a thousand pounds sterling, for his own
                     expenses, and while the Sea Gull made rapid progress homeward, the unfortunate
                     supercargo lay a helpless cripple here.</p>

                  <head type="sub">RETURN OF THE BARQUE TO ENGLAND.</head>
                  <p>FAIR winds attended the Sea Gull, on her return voyage, and in due time she
                     reached Liverpool, again, with her rich and costly Indian freight. The moment
                     she was signalized, a despatch went down by post to Mr. Maitland, who
                     immediately forwarded the announcement also to Mr. Hargrave, senior, of her
                     arrival. They hastened up to Liverpool, together, to greet the supercargo on
                     his safe return, and to congratulate him on his good fortune, which they had
                     heard of by a previous vessel that had recently come home from Hong Kong. Their
                     surprise and disappointment may be guessed at, when they reached Liverpool, and
                     learned that young Hargrave was not on board, and that he had been left at
                     Calcutta, under such painful but unavoidable circumstances.</p>
                  <p>No fault could be found with the course that had been adopted by the master of
                     the barque, in his emergency, more especially when his owners were informed
                     that he remained until the last moment, and sailed—when he did leave—only at
                     the request of the supercargo himself, who saw that it would be impossible for
                     him to leave India for several weeks, at the least. They were therefore
                     reluctantly compelled, for the interest of all concerned, to put to sea again
                     without him, but he was sure that the young man was in good hands.</p>
                  <p>"How did this accident occur?" inquired his father, deeply distressed at this
                     suddenly acquired information.</p>
                  <p>"He was returning to the barque, in the evening, and stumbled into a cavity
                     that had been left uncovered on his way. His leg was badly broken, and he was
                     cut up in the head and shoulders. It was impossible to move him much in the
                     condition he then was, and old Rajab, at whose house he was soon after
                     domiciled, had secured the services of a surgeon and a physician, both of whom
                     peremptorily refused to allow him to be taken away. We had no surgeon on board
                     the Sea Gull, and I thought it prudent that he should remain where he would not
                     be shaken about as he must be necessarily on shipboard, and where his wounds
                     could be so much better cared for than it was possible for us to do, in the
                     barque, you know, sir," answered the captain.</p>
                  <p>"You did rightly," said Mr. Maitland. "I know Sedd Rajab well, and he will take
                     good care of George, I am certain, for my sake."</p>
                  <p>"He gave me orders," continued the captain, "to settle his affairs with his
                     ownere, in accordance with the records he had previously kept, on board (as he
                     was unable to write you), and when I finally parted with him, he said he should
                     return by the first convenient opportunity, when he should have sufficiently
                     recovered to be able to bear the fatigue of the voyage home."</p>
                  <p>Letters of condolence and sympathy were immediately got ready by both Mr.
                     Maitland and the foster-father of young Hargreve, which were subsequently
                     transmitted to him—in case he should not be able to leave Calcutta so soon as
                     he originally expected.</p>
                  <p>The result of the voyage was ascertained in due time. In the course of six
                     weeks from the day of her arrival at Liverpool, the whole affairs of the Sea
                     Gull had been closed up, and the venture proved a largely profitable one to all
                     who had been concerned in it. The share which fell to George's lot, minus the
                     thousand pounds for which he had drawn in Calcutta upon account, amounted to a
                     very handsome sum, which, as soon as it came into Mr. Maitland's hands, he
                     caused to be paid over to Mr. Hargreve, senior, whose pecuniary affairs had
                     become extremely straitened, previous to its receipt. The nice sense of honor
                     which Mr. Hargreve entertained in money matters, however, deterred him from
                     appropriating a shilling of his son's funds to his own use, at that moment.
                     And, while the foster-father was halting, amid his indecision, between his
                     opinion of the propriety of thus using the money, and the chances of his
                     prospective bankruptcy in case he did <emph>not</emph> avail of it, he received
                     by a ship that left Calcutta two months after his son's accident, the following
                     letter from the supercargo:</p>

                              <p>"MY DEAR FATHER:—Before this finds you, you will have learned from
                                 the captain of the Sea Gull—if she arrives safely, as I trust she
                                 may—how I am detained here, and the reason of my not accompanying
                                 the barque to the home I so earnestly desire to see once more.</p>
                              <p>"My injured limb has healed, and I am at this writing able to move
                                 about gently, upon the shoulders of a couple of soodras who attend
                                 me constantly. I am still tarrying at the bungalow of Sedd Rajab,
                                 where I was taken on the evening of the accident. I have been cared
                                 for much better than I expected, though the Hindoo in whose house I
                                 am quartered (and to whom I was introduced by our mutual friend Mr.
                                 Maitland) holds but an indifferent opinion, I fancy, of Englishmen!
                                 However, his daughter, a charming girl of eighteen or nineteen, has
                                 been peculiarly attentive to my needs and my whims.</p>
                              <p>"Yet I have suffered greatly, and am still very feeble. I do not
                                    <emph>hope</emph> to walk much for another dreary month, at the
                                 least; and I shall write you again, by the next vessel that touches
                                 here, bound to the westward. You cannot imagine how much I desire
                                 to see you all, and more especially my family—for, do you know, I
                                 have been entrusted with a <emph>secret,</emph> here, through a
                                 strange doctor, whom chance brought to my bed-side, and which
                                 nearly relates to <emph>you,</emph> particularly? You shall hear
                                 the strange story he related to me, if I ever enjoy the happiness
                                 of meeting you again.</p>
                              <p>"I directed the captain of our barque to confer with yourself and
                                 Mr. Maitland, on his arrival, and I authorized him to adjust my
                                 account with the owners, and to have my share of the voyage,
                                 remaining due, paid into your hands, or Mr. Maitland's. You will
                                 see to all this, and when you receive it, I hope you will directly
                                 use it as <emph>your own,</emph> my dear father. If it shall
                                 relieve your pecuniary embarrassment in any degree, I shall be very
                                 happy to have aided thus in serving you, who have done so much and
                                 so willingly, as you have in past days, to aid and assist me. I
                                 enclose you an order upon the owners of the Sea Gull for any amount
                                 that may legally be my due, in settlement of the voyage, and I
                                 again repeat, it is yours, freely and deservedly.</p>
                              <p>"This letter is penned by piecemeal, for I am too ill, yet, to
                                 write much at a time. Pray send it over to Sunnyside, after you
                                 peruse it, with my kind regards to good Mr. Maitland and his

                                 suffice for him, this time, and I will write him direct, at a

                                 hope, as I now do, for my speedy recovery and return to my native

                                 with white 'barbarians.' I have made no declarations, yet, because

                  <p>This epistle was a most acceptable one, and was read by his father, and
                     Maitland, with great pleasure.</p>
                  <p>"I remember," said Mr. Maitland, "some five years ago, of hearing a returning
                     Englishman (who passed a year in the East) remark that Rajab's daughter was the
                     most lovely girl he had over seen. But George has found <emph>another,</emph>
                     it seems." The wording of George's letter had entirely misled them!</p>
                  <p>The Sea Gull was got ready for her third voyage. The foster-father of George
                     Hargreve no longer hesitated about appropriating the funds so generously placed
                     in his hands by his adopted son, and he soon found himself entirely relieved
                     from present pecuniary trouble, and "went on his way rejoicing."</p>
                  <p>Other letters were subsequently received in England, by young Hargreve's
                     friends, who, two months later, were pleased to learn from him that he was then
                     on his feet once more; and would soon be able to start for England, fully
                     recovered from his late serious trouble abroad.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">A SCENE AT RAJAB'S BUNGALOW.</head>
                  <p>THE sun had set in glorious splendor over the land of the Hindoos, and the warm
                     south wind came laden with the odors of a thousand spice-groves, across the
                     waters. Upon the latticed piazza of the old merchant's dwelling sat George
                     Hargreve, alone with Katrin, Rajab's lovely daughter.</p>
                  <p>The fair and youthful Englishman had almost entirely recovered from his late
                     injury, for nearly four months had expired since his accident occurred. Old
                     Rajab was lying very ill, and he had not been out of his sick chamber for six
                     weeks. The lovers were unrestrained, therefore, so far as his irksome
                     surveillance was concerned.</p>
                  <p>I have said <emph>the lovers!</emph> Did they love? Had the fair and gentle
                     Hindoo girl yet dared to brave the perils that awaited her, if she forgot her
                     parent's constant injunctions to avoid the society of the "Christian dogs" that
                     whined and capered around her? Did Katrin, the darling and only child of the
                     wealthiest and most bigoted nabob in all Calcutta, venture to smile on the
                     stranger from a western land? Had all her father's warnings been fruitless? Did
                     she not fear the spirit of Sheva, the destroyer, if she neglected her father's
                     counsels? Would not Seeb curse her, if she were found in the arms of the
                     infidel Englishman? Had she forgotten father, mother, fortune, religion,
                     spirits of good and evil—<emph>all?</emph> We shall see, anon!</p>
                  <p>The lovers sat together alone and unobserved, and the balmy south wind gently
                     moved the tresses that hung across fair Katrin's ivory shoulders. It was an
                     hour for wooing, and Hargreve was in the mood. He looked into Katrin's eyes,
                     but <emph>she</emph> did not speak of love.</p>
                  <p>"Katrin," he said, as he took her hand, "I am your debtor for a thousand
                     kindnesses during my late fearful illness. I am now about to leave you, Katrin.
                     How can I repay your favors?"</p>
                  <p>"Leave us?" said Katrin, mechanically.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, Katrin. I must now return to my native land, very soon."</p>
                  <p>"You will not go," said the Hindoo girl, emphatically.</p>
                  <p>"So you said four months ago, sweet Katrin."</p>
                  <p>"Did I not speak truly?"</p>
                  <p>"You did, for that occasion. But, for my unfortunate accident, however, I
                     should now have been safe at home, probably. I trust that no such impediment
                     will now prevent me, Katrin?"</p>
                  <p>"You will not go!" repeated Katrin, firmly.</p>
                  <p>"Do you think so?"</p>
                  <p>"I know so."</p>
                  <p>"How do you guess it?"</p>
                  <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC5953-00000028"/>
                  <p>"I do not <emph>guess.</emph> You will not go."</p>
                  <p>"Pray explain, fair Katrin!" continued George, allowing himself to be strangely
                     influenced by her determined tone and manner towards him.</p>
                  <p>"The father of Katrin will shortly join his tribe, in the spirit-land,"
                     responded the girl, in a low, sweet voice. "When Rajab is gone, she will have
                     none to love or care for her. My father is dying, yonder. Will you leave Katrin
                     alone?"</p>
                  <p>"But will Katrin, <emph>dare</emph> Katrin love the English Christian? Is he
                     not a dog—a <foreign xml:lang="TAM">paria?</foreign>" said Hargreve.</p>
                  <p>"Who calls him paria? Who calls him dog?"</p>
                  <p>"Does not the religion of your fathers so denominate him, and his whole race,
                     my Katrin?"</p>
                  <p>There was a pause. The Hindoo beauty thought of her fathers' repeated
                     injunctions. She thought, too, of the books she had read, during the past year
                     or two—and especially of the truths she believed she had discovered in the last
                     six or eight months, clandestinely, in her examination of a copy of the sacred
                     volume that George Hargreve had placed secretly in her hands, for perusal and
                     examination. She reflected upon the beauties of the Vedas and the Shastres,
                     which she had so strenuously been early taught solely to believe in, and to
                     which, for years, she had turned alone for religious instruction and
                     consolation, under her parents' advice.</p>
                  <p>There was a struggling at her heart, that had been moving her, silently, but
                     effectually, for months! But, even in the study of the Hindoo worshipper's
                     famed "sheet anchor," the <title>Obater Bah</title>—that volume which the
                     native of the East so tacitly clings to, fair Katrin had found an "aching
                     void," that all her natural and acquired philosophy could not fill. Her
                     father's noted text-books, the Rug Veda, the Sheham, the Pudger Veda, the
                     Obater Bah, all were fatal blanks to her mind, since she had more recently
                     conned over the beautiful truths of the Sacred Scriptures; and she felt that a
                     new light, the bright beam which the good God of the Christian causes to shine
                     upon the soul of the believer, had begun to dawn upon her hitherto benighted
                     heart! Katrin would be a Christian! But she did not yet declare it.</p>
                  <p>"What is my Katrin thinking of?" asked Hargreve, at last, observing the certain
                     workings of her mind, as they still sat together, in silence.</p>
                  <p>"Of the Christian's hope," replied the gentle girl, in a low whisper. "Ah, if
                     the tenets of the great book be real, if the beauteous principles there
                     inculcated are not rhapsodies, if <emph>we</emph> could be permitted to trust
                     therein, and believe as <emph>you</emph> believe, how consoling, how
                     satisfying, how marvellously glorious would be our joy, how grateful the peace
                     that must follow the assurances your Bible gives us of present and future
                     bliss!"</p>
                  <p>"And cannot Katrin herself believe?" continued Hargreve, clasping her warm fair
                     hand; "cannot the loveliest and the gentlest of proud India's daughters bring
                     her mind to trust in the one <emph>true</emph> God?"</p>
                  <p>She gazed into his handsome face, the struggle passed. Katrin laid her head
                     upon Hargreve's breast, amid her flowing tears, he pressed her closely to his
                     heart, her heathen thoughts were dispelled, the breath of penitence swept
                     across her soul, she wept, she smiled again, and owned herself a
                        <emph>Christian!</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>Young Hargreve saw his opportunity, and he did not suffer it to slip by him.
                     They talked for a time of the Christian's creed, of faith, and hope, and
                     charity; and this soon led the ardent youth to speak again of love, in
                     earnest.</p>
                  <p>"Will Katrin love the stranger, too?" he said. "Will she bid him hope, one day,
                     to make himself worthy of her hand?"</p>
                  <p>"Ah, Hargreve," she replied, "have I not already discovered myself? Has not
                     Katrin disclosed her weakness, and assured you, a thousand times, how nearly
                     allied to her future happiness is the society of him whom the good God of the
                     Christian so mysteriously caused to wander upon her path? Believe it, then! You
                     are <emph>my own</emph>—my treasured, only favored one, the joy of my every
                     hour, my prayed for boon, my idol, benefactor, saviour, all that I will ask of
                     Heaven, here on earth!" she continued, in her wild natural enthusiasm; and
                     again the English lover earnestly clasped to his bosom the Hindoo's lovely
                     daughter, the truthful "Belle of the Orient!"</p>
                  <p>They separated, after a blissful interview; but they had entered upon the verge
                     of a fearful venture! Old Rajab would sooner far have seen his child a corpse
                     than to have known that she had committed either of the unpardonable sins, as
                        <emph>he</emph> esteemed them, of renouncing her religion, or of promising
                     to wed a Christian.</p>
                  <p>Katrin well knew his opinion upon these two points, and so she warned her lover
                     to be circumspect, for the present.</p>
                  <p>"You will not return to England, George," she said, in a tone that Hargreve had
                     never heard her use before. "You are not yet recovered, you know. You will
                     tarry here—<emph>here,</emph>" she repeated with emphasis, "under our roof. My
                     father will never leave his room again, alive."</p>
                  <p>"I fear you are correct in your opinion," said Hargreve. "He is very ill."</p>
                  <p>"I know it, I am satisfied of it. Poor Rajab will depart, still clinging to his
                     idolatry, but I must not know his curse—a parent's curse—"</p>
                  <p>"<emph>You?</emph> Wherefore?" exclaimed the lover.</p>
                  <p>"Think you he could forgive me? Never, Hargreve! So, pray be wary. I will be
                     dutiful, and in my humble way, I will join my mother in soothing his final
                     days. But he is sinking. When his sun goes down, at last, we shall be at
                     liberty to act. Till then, be discreet, and suffer no chance to betray the
                     feelings or the relations which now exists between us."</p>
                  <p>"You may trust me, Katrin."</p>
                  <p>"You will not go to England, George?" she added, archly, with a smile.</p>
                  <p>"You are correct, sweet Katrin. I will <emph>not</emph> go, for the present; I
                     am not strong enough, I see."</p>
                  <p>"Did I not say so?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, yes. I will obey."</p>
                  <p>Young Hargreve kissed the fair cheek of the fascinating Hindoo girl, and they
                     parted, understandingly, at last.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE COBRA DI CAPELLO.</head>
                  <p>AMONG the pests of the East Indies may be classed the numerous reptiles that
                     infest every part of the country, and which are known so notoriously,
                     everywhere, for their variety and numbers, in that land. Foremost, among those
                     of a more dangerous character, stands the fatal cobra di capello or hooded
                     snake, whose bite is certain death.</p>
                  <p>This terribly dreaded visitor is found everywhere, at times, throughout the
                     entire breadth of Hindostan, and no bungalow, or cottage, or resting-place, is
                     exempt from his calls, as he is no possible respecter of persons, station or
                     locale. The cobra capello will insinuate himself through the crevices or the
                     thatch of an eastern dwelling, at any hour, and the party who is so unfortunate
                     as to be bitten by this venomous reptile may count himself among the dead! His
                     fate is sealed, as surely as the fang of this monster strikes through his
                     flesh.</p>
                  <p>In the more densely settled cities of Hindostan this unwelcome viper is not so
                     often seen; but many instances are on record where it is shown that he comes
                     and goes as suits his pleasure, even among the more closely peopled towns; and
                     death has frequently followed upon his visits in the great cities.</p>
                  <p>About three weeks after the happy interview that passed between Hargreve and
                     Katrin, and which we described in our last chapter, old Rajab lay upon his
                     uneasy mattress, a sufferer, whose bodily woes were soon to be terminated; how
                     soon he did not know. He suspected that his final end was approaching, however,
                     and he suspected, too, that Katrin had forgotten her faith in Brahminism, in a
                     degree, and was inclined to favor the young Englishman more than the old man
                     fancied.</p>
                  <p>"Is he gone?" said Rajab to his daughter, who sat at his bedside, fanning her
                     sick father.</p>
                  <p>"Is he gone, Katrin?"</p>
                  <p>"Who, father?"</p>
                  <p>"The Englishman."</p>
                  <p>"Hargreve?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, he who has dared to look upon my child with an evil eye."</p>
                  <p>"You surely do not speak of our honored English guest, my father!" exclaimed
                     Katrin, surprised and grieved.</p>
                  <p>"I speak of him of the pale cheek, whom we have housed, of late."</p>
                  <p>"He is our friend," said Katrin.</p>
                  <p>"He is a serpent, daughter; who has crawled beneath our shelter—whom we have
                     nursed, and who now turns to bite us for our pains. Is he not gone?"</p>
                  <p>"Mr. Hargreve has not yet left, my father."</p>
                  <p>"Bid him go, then, instantly. I must die, my child! I would die in peace. I
                     cannot die while the English dog curses my household, here. Bid him go, I
                     say!"</p>
                  <p>"I cannot do that, my father."</p>
                  <p>"Call Bhikez, then."</p>
                  <p>"O, father!" cried the beauty, "do not be thus cruel and unreasonable. He will
                     leave, anon, of his own free will. He is now your friend. Do not compel him to
                     turn your enemy."</p>
                  <p>"This from my daughter," exclaimed old Rajab, bitterly. "This from Katrin—my
                        <emph>child?</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"Father, hear me—"</p>
                  <p>"Daughter, silence!" said the old man, interrupting her with a show of
                     severity. Then, in a milder tone, he continued:</p>
                  <p>"Katrin! You have been the pride of my house, the pearl of my eyes, the diamond
                     of my soul, my ruby of promise—my jewel, my heart, my joy, my boast, for
                     eighteen years and more. Do you forget your <emph>father,</emph> Katrin?"</p>
                  <p>"No—no!" cried the girl, amid her tears.</p>
                  <p>"Listen, then. I would sooner see my Katrin dead at my feet, than she should
                     smile upon this dog who seeks to pester her. Observe me, Katrin! Lands I have,
                     you know, and goods, and jewels in abundance. All is yours, yours, my
                     much-loved daughter, if you obey your father's wishes. If you forget—not a
                     rupee of mine is left you, when I depart. Bid the stranger go, I
                        say!—'<emph>sh!</emph>" he continued suddenly, and an awful pallor blanched
                     his cheek, as he repeated this warning, slowly and mysteriously—"hush! What is
                     that?"</p>
                  <p>"I hear no noise, my father."</p>
                  <p>"—'sh! Hush!"</p>
                  <p>A livid deathly hue pervaded old Rajab's face, and his features were as cold as
                     death itself, plainly from some secret terrible affright. Katrin feared for his
                     reason, momentarily, and thought that over-excitement in his then weak state,
                     had caused this sudden and awful change in his appearance. The Hindoo's
                     eyeballs seemed as if turning out of their sockets, and he endeavored, without
                     either motion of muscle or limb, to direct attention to the foot of the bed—but
                     to no purpose, for he was misunderstood.</p>
                  <p>"In Muni's name, don't stir!" muttered the Hindoo, as he noticed his daughter
                     about to approach him nearer.</p>
                  <p>The rigid glare of poor old Rajab seemed the gaze of death! His daughter leaned
                     towards him, still as a marble statue. He feared to breathe, and monstrous
                     drops of sweat gushed from his still paling temples, when he suddenly shrieked
                     out:</p>
                  <p>"The cobra, Katrin!" and the secret was told!</p>
                  <p>The terrible death-dealer had entered the apartment, and had found his way
                     unnoticed beneath the folds of the bed-clothes. He had coiled himself across
                     the Hindoo's foot, ere the sufferer had suspected his presence, and his terror
                     may be imagined, as he so suddenly realized the fearful pressure of his folds!
                     The cold glazy skin of the murderous serpent was plainly felt upon the fevered
                     instep of the invalid, and he knew that his hour had come!</p>
                  <p>At the sound of that frightful name, the cobra, so well-known and so deeply
                     feared by every dweller in the East, poor Katrin instantly shrunk back,
                     appalled and horror-stricken. No aid could be afforded, in <emph>that</emph>
                     emergency! The slightest motion of his person, the first intimation of
                     disturbance that occurred, either on the part of the invalid, or of another,
                     would prove the certain precursor of a blow from the reptile's fatal fangs!</p>
                  <p>One desperate start, that should draw away the foot entirely, and leave the
                     monstor below the reach of his limb, might save him. But he bound himself still
                     tighter, and his upper extremity could now be felt, above, towards the
                     knee.</p>
                  <p>Human nature could bear up no longer, in that terrible dilemma. His remaining
                     strength was concentrated into one final effort, and with a piercing yell of
                     agony and fright, he started up! It was the Hindoo's final struggle for life.
                     The serpent clung to the contracting limb for an instant, and in the next he
                     gave the fatal wound. Poor Rajab screamed, the inmates of the bungalow rushed
                     to his apartment, and the serpent was soon despatched by Hargreve and the
                     servants of the house. But his fatal work had been thoroughly accomplished!</p>
                  <p>The injured limb was quickly bared, and the usual antidotes were applied, with
                     vigor, but the swelling around the wounds increased. The leg was terribly
                     swollen in a few minutes, in spite of all that could be done; in a little time
                     longer consciousness departed, the deadly venom continued to work, and
                     respiration ceased. Sedd Rajab was a corpse!</p>
                  <p>The Hindoo's bungalow was indeed a house of mourning. So sudden and
                     unlooked-for had been Sedd Rajab's death, that he had made no<pb n="60-61"
                        xml:id="VAC5953-00000030"/> preparation whatever for the event—and, as a
                     consequence, his wife became the legal and sole heir of his entire vast
                     possessions, under sanction of the Hindoo laws.</p>
                  <p>No pecuniary provision was known to have been made by the father for his
                     daughter, the mother was selfish, unscrupulous, and miserly, and Katrin now had
                     nothing in the world save her beauty, her education, and the few jewels she
                     wore upon her person. A single diamond cluster, enclosed in a tasteful casket,
                     but of which she did not know the value at all, had been bestowed upon her by
                     her parent, on her fifteenth birthday. This treasure she had always secretly
                     preserved, and she still possessed it. But, so far as Rajab's estate was
                     concerned, the daughter know no right to part or parcel of it.</p>
                  <p>The remains of the wealthy Hindoo were buried with the customary honors, and
                     the usual ostentatious ceremonies. Among the <emph>real</emph> mourners (who
                     were few!) the daughter grieved for her kind old father's death—and Hargreve
                     condoled with the weeping Katrin, in the midst of her loss.</p>
                  <p>The establishment of the rich Hindoo was immediately broken up by the widow,
                     who went directly into more private quarters, taking along with her the loving
                     and beauteous daughter, who had so entranced our hero.</p>
                  <p>And thus, for a time, the lovers were entirely separated; though not without a
                     frank and mutual understanding between them.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE HINDOO MERCHANT'S LEGACY.</head>
                  <p>As the reader has already been informed, Sedd Rajab was an immensely wealthy,
                     but latterly a retired merchant of India. His means had been accumulated in the
                     most profitable trade of the East, at a period when large fortunes were readily
                     acquired and in a brief number of years, comparatively with the present
                     time.</p>
                  <p>Rajab was a thorough Hindoo, of the old stamp—a firm and unalterable devotee to
                     all the superstitions, the bigotry, the intolerance, and the dogged manners of
                     the most rigid of Brahminites; and, under all circumstances, at all times, he
                     was unchanged in his views, and in the habits he had imbibed with his early
                     years.</p>
                  <p>In his heart, he detested the foreigners, though for many long years his
                     mercantile associations had brought him into continual contact with them, and
                     by means of their influence and their purchases, from year to year, he had
                     accumulated the greater portion of his splendid fortune.</p>
                  <p>But he had little thought for anything akin to gratitude! This was no part of
                     his creed, or doctrine. On the contrary, his aim had been to make the most out
                     of the white barbarians, to so far conciliate them, from time to time, as to
                     enable him to cope with fair or unfair competition, and to secure all the trade
                     that it was possible to get.</p>
                  <p>In this aim he had been successful, from a small beginning, and it was scarcely
                     to be wondered at, that, with his bigoted and benighted knowledge of honor and
                     religious principle, he became more and more settled in his aversions towards
                     that people whom he came to know so intimately in traffic, and whom he had
                     proved to be "sharp" customers, to say the least of them.</p>
                  <p>Nearly three weeks had expired since Rajab had been consigned to the waters of
                     the Ganges; and no evidence had yet turned up that his daughter had been
                     provided for, in any manner—until one day a document was found by Katrin,
                     accidentally, among his papers, which proved to be a memorandum of her legacy.
                     It was simple and pointed, and merely provided that "if his only child should
                     continue faithful to the religion he had taught her, and should, with her
                     mother's approval—in case of his death—unite herself in marriage with a true
                     and faithful Brahmin, whom she should name, then, and in that<pb n="62-63"
                        xml:id="VAC5953-00000031"/> case, upon her bridal day, she should receive a
                     dowry in the shape of one Hindoo lac of gold rupees,<ref rend="super"
                        target="#note_001" xml:id="return_001">*</ref>
                      to be paid over from the bulk of his estate. If, on the contrary, she
                     should refuse her mother's choice, and should dare to wed a foreigner, she
                     should be cut off with but a hundred silver rupees, without farther expectancy
                     in any shape whatever—her mother becoming the residuary legatee of his entire
                     fortune and property, otherwise," etc., etc.</p>
                  <note place="foot" xml:id="note_001">
                     
                     <p><ref target="#return_001">*</ref>A lac is one hundred thousand. A gold rupee equals about seven
                        dollars.</p>
                  </note>
                  <p>Katrin had never yet thought about a dowry, in any manner, and she now saw, for
                     the first time, what must be her pecuniary fate, if she persisted in adhering
                     to her first and only love. Yet she had already renounced, in her own heart,
                     the idolatry of Brahminism, and had conscientiously embraced the Christian
                     religion. Hargreve had never been so selfish as to enter upon the slightest
                     calculation in reference to the fortune she might attain to—and if the idea had
                     ever entered his head at all, he looked upon its darker side, at once—for he
                     was satisfied that old Rajab did not love him, and, during his life, would
                     unquestionably have scouted the idea had he proposed it, of giving him his
                     daughter in marriage, with or without an allowance.</p>
                  <p>Thus the lovers were equally content as to any future fortune. Yet,
                     notwithstanding this, fair Katrin, who had never yet known an ungratified
                     desire, for lack of ready means, would very gladly have brought to her future
                     husband a share of the wealth which she knew her father possessed, and did not
                     need; while, at the same time, young Hargreve most assuredly would not have
                     taken it at all amiss to have become a participator in the riches that Rajab
                     might so easily have showered on his child, if he were so fortunate as to call
                     her his wife, and if the aged Hindoo chose to be liberal. The case was
                     presented fairly, and plainly, for the beautiful Katrin's consideration, and
                     she did not hesitate to decide what she would choose to do, if her wish could
                     now be gratified.</p>
                  <p>In the one case, it stood, adherence to Brahminism, a Hindoo husband, and seven
                     hundred thousand dollars; in the other, a renunciation of idolatry, the husband
                     of her love and choice, and less than fifty silver dollars! She decided upon
                     her future—for good or ill, and folding up the document, which she now
                     entertained no doubt had purposely been placed within her reach, she enclosed
                     it to her maternal parent, forthwith, accompanied by the following brief
                     epistle:</p>

                  <p>This expressive missive, with its enclosure, was duly submitted to the
                     inspection of George Hargreve, when they next chanced to meet, prior to which
                     interview, he had arranged for their departure from Calcutta in a fine ship
                     bound to Havre, in France. This plan was clandestine, but imperative, under the
                     circumstances. Both Katrin and George felt certain that extreme measures would
                     instantly be adopted to prevent the consummation of their intentions, as soon
                     as the mother should be advised of their determination, and it was decided that
                     the letter should not be forwarded until they had left the port. The supercargo
                     fully approved of Katrin's summary course, in the premises, and preparations
                     were directly made for their departure from the land of the Hindoos.</p>
                  <p>The temporary means that Hargreve had provided himself with, still held out
                     bravely, and he was amply supplied with money for his present wants. There was
                     no clergyman in Calcutta to whom he could apply to perform the marriage rite
                     before they embarked, or he would have taken to England his beautiful Indian
                        <emph>wife.</emph> As it was, therefore, the lovers solemnly pledged
                     themselves to each other, in secret, and Katrin placed her honor and her future
                     fate in the hands of the only man she had ever known to love, without a scruple
                     or a doubt of his fidelity, his truth, and his devotion, a course she never had
                     occasion to regret.</p>
                  <p>Hargreve secured passage for himself "and lady" on board the homeward bound
                     Indiaman, that lay in the river ready to sail, and on a cloudless night, with a
                     free wind, the Emperor left her anchorage in the Hoogly, for sunny France, with
                     the youthful lovers safe on board.</p>
                  <p>At noon, on the following day, while the family were in search of the absent
                     daughter, who had been missed since morning, the letter she had left found its
                     way, with its stunning intelligence, to her bigoted mother's hands!</p>
                  <p>The ship was well at sea, and was bounding over the shining waves towards her
                     western home. Fair Katrin did not grieve, for she was by far too happy to have
                     thus escaped—and time flew merrily by, as the young fugitives rejoiced together
                     at their present and prospective happiness.</p>
                  <p>The Hindoo mother soon became reconciled to her bereavement of husband and
                     child, and turned to her idols and her household gods, and found a satisfaction
                     in her continuous future mummery.</p>

                     in the East India trade about four years. The present was her third return
                     voyage from Calcutta and Canton. She enjoyed a fine run, homeward, until they
                     reached the Spanish, and up to the French coast, even—when their prospects
                     changed for the worse.</p>
                  <p>So fine had been the weather, after crossing the Bay of Biscay, that for two
                     days not a reef had been taken in the canvass, from flying jib to spanker and
                     sky-sails; and the Emperor shot away, at a round thirteen-knot rate, over the
                     sparkling sea towards the English Channel. Point Penmach lay to the eastward,
                     and the ship approached still north, towards Brest, on the coast of France;
                     when the gale freshened, sensibly, and squally winds were encountered.</p>
                  <p>At sunset, it was found necessary to shorten sail. The royal-masts were sent
                     down, the top-gallant sails were taken in, and the topsails were finally
                     reefed. An hour after dark, the orders were given to close-reef the fore and
                     mainsails, too; and when the second watch was set, the wind had so increased,
                     while the sky grew dark and threatening, that the fore and main spencer,
                     close-reefed main-topsail, fore-top stay-sail and reefed spanker, were all she
                     could carry. Squalls succeeded, and at midnight, the Emperor was lying-to,
                     under close-reefed topsails and lower storm-sails, only—for a violent gale from
                     the northwest had set in, and the ship labored heavily.</p>
                  <p>The Emperor was closely laden with cumbrous goods, gunny-bags, silks, opium,
                     teas, indigo, etc., and her freight was exceedingly valuable. A long and heavy
                     roll in the sea soon caused uneasiness on the part of the captain, who was a
                     good sailor, but a comparatively cautious and timid man, in times of peril. He
                     understood the working of his ship in all ordinary weather, and thus far in his
                     experience, he could boast of never having encountered any serious accident at
                     sea. He was now evidently anxious.</p>
                  <p>In accordance with a theory he had, of his own, and which thus far in his life
                     had fortunately proved successful, he kept his course considerably in
                     shore—from Cape St. Vincent to Cape Finisterre—while most shipmasters who have
                     occasion to pass up and down the usually turbulent Bay of Biscay, incline to
                     avail themselves of a more central route, and better sea-room. The captain of
                     the Emperor had adopted his own course, however, as usual with him; and now he
                     found himself suddenly lying-to, in a severe nor'west gale, off Brest, within a
                     few leagues of as bad a range of rocky coast as is known shor of the Orkney
                     Islands!</p>
                  <p>By two o'clock in the morning, the ship had fallen away to leeward
                     considerably, and from the observation made at meridian on the previous day,
                     the captain knew that he had now no space to spare, with a heavy northwester
                     bursting over his larboard, and a sheet of rocky breakers within hail, almost,
                     on his lee.</p>
                  <p>Hargreve had not entered his berth at all during the night. His knowledge of
                     scenes like this had taught him that it was more prudent to be on the lookout,
                     in such emergencies; and he did not fancy the ship's later management, at all,
                     for he was an advocate for the middle course, from the Portuguese coast, and
                     knew well the perils of old Biscay. He was too good a sailor, and had been too
                     long an officer on shipboard to interfere, however, or to offer advice,
                     gratuitously. He drew out a brace of "life-preservers" which he had provided
                     himself with, and, encased, in a rough weather suit, he silently kept an eye to
                     windward, and waited for whatever might turn up, hoping for the best, but
                     really in fear of the worst!</p>
                  <p>So violent had the hurricane become, at last, it was clear that it would be
                     impossible to claw off the coast, and it was quite as clear, to all on board
                     who knew anything of the ship's jeopardy, that she must inevitably go ashore.
                     No one saw this sooner than did young Hargreve, who then lost no time in
                     communicating with Katrin, who was confined below, with three or four other
                     passengers, and who was in the deepest alarm, in consequence of the rolling of
                     the ship, and the roaring of the still increasing wind and storm.</p>
                  <p>"Is not this frightful, George?" said Katrin, clinging to his arm. "What is the
                     prospect?"</p>
                  <p>"Not over agreeable, I assure you," said the lieutenant. "But we must face it,
                     with our best courage. Here," he continued, passing a distended life-preserver
                     about her waist, and securing it, "now, do not leave my side, on any
                     consideration, after we quit this cabin."</p>
                  <p>"Is it thus threatening?"</p>
                  <p>"We are in imminent peril. If the ship does not haul off to windward within an
                     hour, I am sure she must go ashore."</p>
                  <p>"And be lost!" exclaimed Katrin—"lost, did you say, George?"</p>
                  <p>"We will not anticipate the result, dearest, but can only do our best for
                     self-preservation, if the trial comes. Have you anything of value that you wish
                     to preserve? If so, secure it. We shall do well if we escape, should the ship
                     strike on this ragged coast."</p>
                  <p>"No, George, nothing. Yes, yes," she continued, an instant afterwards, "the
                     littlecasket."</p>
                  <p>"Quick, then! Secure it, and your jewels. Attach them to your person—you will
                     have no time to attend to this, by-and-by."</p>
                  <p>Half an hour afterwards, there was an increased bustle on deck. All hands had
                     been summoned from below. Daylight began to break, and the foaming shore was
                     clearly in sight! Ah, how the perilled crew of the now ill-fated Emperor
                     yearned for the aid that could not reach them! And how earnestly did Katrin
                     pray to the good God of the Christian, that they might yet be preserved from
                     the danger so closely in view.</p>
                  <p>The topsail had been, blown out, and the topmast was carried away, three hours
                     before daylight. Not an inch of canvass could be spread on her, and she was now
                     completely at the mercy of the crashing rolling seas that gushed down upon her,
                     one after another, as she was sweeping rapidly on to the lee-shore beyond—where
                     a grave was yawning among the boulders, to receive her creaking timbers, her
                     cargo, and her crew!</p>
                  <p>The shore for miles above and below where the ship now tossed, exhibited one
                     white stream of foaming surge. There were but a few rocks in sight outside of
                     the general rugged land itself, the shore being bold in that vicinity, but too
                     high up, evidently, to strand the vessel with any hope of subsequent safety.
                     The helm was finally put up, and the anchor was dropped. For a moment the ship
                     jerked round, a crash followed, and the cables had parted. The best-bower was
                     then quickly got over—another wrench succeeded—the mingled shouts of, "Lost!
                     breakers! to the boats! God save us!" followed this, and officers, passengers,
                     and crew were huddled in a mass of uncontrollable confusion over the reeling
                     vessel's side, as she tumbled ruthlessly on before that driving hurricane!</p>
                  <p>The men had deserted the wheel, which they neglected to lash, and every man
                     appeared to be for himself, the natural mildness of the captain disabling him
                     from having the slightest control over them, amid the fury of their fears and
                     excitement. The ship was rolling broadside on, and every wave that came
                     breached clean over her decks. More than half the crew had already been washed
                     overboard, the shrieking passengers clung to the weather shrouds, two of the
                     boats had been stove at the side, and lost, in the<pb n="66-67"
                        xml:id="VAC5953-00000033"/> midst of the consternation, and the long-boat
                     still remained at her lashings, the wind and sea being so heavy that it had
                     been too risky to attempt to clear her. This was the last ray of hope, however,
                     and as but little nautical skill had been evinced, thus far, by the master of
                     the Emperor, in his present emergency, it was not expected, by Hargreve, that
                     he would now display it!</p>
                  <p>He lacked both courage and decision of character, in a crisis. At the last
                     extremity of time, the lieutenant himself seized an axe, and clinging first to
                     the rigging, then to the mizen shrouds and then to the weather bulwarks, while
                     the ship careened and pitched fearfully, he contrived to cut the lashings that
                     secured the boat, which fell heavily over against the starboard side of the
                     vessel. After considerable labor, she was lowered away, but, with the greatest
                     difficulty, five persons only got aboard of her, as she swung off astern.
                     Katrin was still clinging to the rigging. Hargreve saw his opportunity, and
                     seizing her in his arms, he sprang aft into the boat, which a moment afterwards
                     was three cables' lengths to leeward of the doomed and sinking Indiaman.</p>
                  <p>The people in the boat were at the mercy of the storm, for there were neither
                     sails nor oars on board the long-boat! Hargreve took the tiller, however, and
                     put her head away from the wind, hoping that they might drift to leeward, and
                     keep afloat until they might chance to fail in with some craft that would have
                     weathered the storm. A small light spar was happily discovered among the
                     rubbish in the bottom of the boat, and with the aid of an old rope or two, and
                     a handful of thole-pins that were scattered with the litter, and with which he
                     wedged the spar into the socket, he contrived to rig a jury-mast that served
                     him, seasonably. Upon this he subsequently bent a large shawl which Katrin had
                     thrown about her at the last moment, and which answered very well for a sail,
                     for the time being, as soon as the wind lulled a little, which was the case an
                     hour after they deserted the ship.</p>
                  <p>Before nine o'clock in the morning of that day, the wind hauled, the clouds
                     began to lighten, and the sea subsided sensibly. But the Emperor had been
                     dashed upon the rocks, twelve leagues south of Brest, and was a total wreck.
                     Not a vestige of her hull was ever seen afterwards, and her cargo never saw the
                     light of day. Of all the crew and passengers on board, none but the five
                     persons in the long-boat were ever discovered, to tell the story of that
                     fearful and fatal wreck!</p>

               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">"LA VENT D'OUEST."</head>
                  <p>THE weather had cleared, though the wind still blew hard and fresh from the
                     south-westward. There was not a sip of water in the longboat, nor a bit of
                     biscuit, even, to allay hunger. The passengers and one of the crew—five souls
                     in all—were still on board the little craft, athirst and hungered, but with no
                     prospect of present relief.</p>
                  <p>They felt that they were better off, however, than they could have been to have
                     tarried longer upon the deck of the Emperor, whose fate they were ignorant of,
                     but which they had no good reason to believe had escaped the jaws of
                     destruction which were wide agape for her, when they were forced away from her
                     side. They regretted that more of the crew had not found their way into the
                     boat, to share with them the sufficient, but still far lessened perils they
                     were now subjected to; but regrets were in vain, and they stood off before the
                     breeze, with their sluggish boat and flimsy <emph>sail,</emph> without compass
                     or probable destination.</p>
                  <p>Before the sun had set, a cry suddenly went up from the sailor in the
                     long-boat, that started the weary souls to their feet. "<emph>Sail ho!</emph>"
                     he shouted, at the very top of his sturdy lungs, as he strained his eyes and
                     pointed across the water.</p>
                  <p>"Where away!" answered Hargreve, looking up, but responding thus from habit,
                     rather than otherwise, for all hands could plainly see a brig hull down to
                     windward, directly in their wake!</p>
                  <p>The helm was put up, the long-boat went off again, and half an hour afterward
                     they hailed the welcome straggler. It proved to be a French vessel, the
                        "<foreign xml:lang="FRA">Vent d'ouest,</foreign>" bound to Marseilles, from
                     London. She came up in the wind immediately, her boat was lowered away, the
                     story was quickly told, and the sufferers were immediately taken on board the
                     brig, where they were comfortably provided for, as she proceeded on her course
                     to the southeast. Five days afterwards, the rescued passengers were comfortably
                     housed, at the Hotel de Marronne, in the port of Marseilles.</p>
                  <p>As soon as they had had time to recuperate a little, Hargreve proceeded on to
                     Boulogne with Katrin, intending to take passage home by the first opportunity.
                     His fair charge had been too much exposed, however, in the previous few days,
                     and had taken a severe cold in the midst of the storm, which terminated in a
                     violent illness. On their arrival at Boulogne, she was unable to proceed on, a
                     physician was called, who pronounced her to be in too critical a condition to
                     be moved further, and she was placed under the care of a nurse, whom Hargreve
                     procured, forthwith. On the following day, a settled fever exhibited itself,
                     and the lieutenant was deeply alarmed to learn from her medical attendant that
                     she was seriously ill!</p>
                  <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC5953-00000034"/>
                  <p>A letter which Hargreve had despatched for England by a ship that sailed three
                     weeks before he left Calcutta, had reached his friends a month previously to
                     the accident he had now encountered. In that communication, he informed his
                     father that he should return home in the Emperor, probably, which had then just
                     arrived in port, and would leave in the course of three weeks. The family, and
                     that of Mr. Maitland, were anxiously looking for George's arrival; and their
                     feelings may be conceived, upon learning as they did one morning that the
                     Emperor had gone ashore off Brest, and all on board had perished! This
                     intelligence had been brought to England by a barque that sailed in company
                     with her, that had escaped the storm, with considerable danger, and which had
                     picked up a piece of the Emperor's stern-frame next day, to which was attached
                     a portion of the ill-fated vessel's name.</p>
                  <p>This then was the terrible fate of poor George Hargreve—the kindly and dutiful
                     son, who had braved the dangers of the Indian Ocean to save his father's
                     tottering credit! The boy had been lost, after his unfortunate mishap at
                     Calcutta, after suffering for months from the horrors of a crushed limb, far in
                     a foreign land, after he had been so eminently successful in his voyage, and
                     when he was so near the haven of his youthful hopes—when the result of his aid,
                     so timely placed within his father's reach, had been turned to such good
                     advantage, and at the hour almost when his grateful foster-parent was hoping to
                     clasp the brave youth to his heart, and thank him for his assistance—at such
                     time, and under such circumstances, the Hargreves and the Maitlands were called
                     upon to mourn his violent death, at sea!</p>
                  <p>So constantly had the time of young Hargreve been occupied, since he arrived at
                     Marseilles, and so confidently did he expect to be able to reach England before
                     any letters could be received at home from him, that he omitted to write at
                     all, until he arrived at Boulogne. As soon as he found himself settled at this
                     place, where he now saw that he would be compelled to remain for some days, at
                     the least, he immediately communicated to his father the details of the wreck,
                     briefly, and informed him of his present safety. In the most delicate manner
                     possible, he also informed him of the occasion of his detention there, and the
                     circumstances that had prompted him to bring to his British home one of India's
                     loveliest daughters.</p>
                  <p>"She is the only child of the wealthy Sedd Rajab," he concluded; "but, for her
                     renunciation of the Hindoo religion, and for embracing Christianity, the old
                     man disowned her! Tell our friend Mr. Maitland this, and add—by the way—that
                     Rajab died in Calcutta, a few days before we left. His property went in bulk,
                     into his wife's possession, and Katrin (that is his daughter), hasn't a
                     shilling in the world! You will smile, I know, at <emph>this</emph> part of my
                     India speculation! But when you see my Hindoo bird, whom I love with my whole
                     heart, I think—at least, I trust—you will not think I have been indiscreet. She
                     will soon be better, I hope, and, in a little time, I shall, with good luck,
                     have the happiness to present her to you, and to greet my many friends at home.
                     My own health is excellent. I have entirely recovered from my late injuries,
                     and I beg you to make my kind regards, once more, to the Maitlands, and my
                     friends."</p>
                  <p>The sickness that prostrated Katrin did not prove so serious as it had been
                     feared it would be. After a week's detention, she was able to ride out in the
                     open air, and at the end of a fortnight, she ventured to undertake the journey
                     northward, to Paris. Here they halted for a few days, at the end of which, she
                     was quite recovered—and at length the lovers took the diligence for Calais, and
                     crossed the Channel to Dover, in excellent health and revived spirits.</p>
                  <p>Tarrying at Dover a single day only, they proceeded on by post horses homeward,
                     and reached the handsome residence of Mr. Hargreve, senior, at last, where they
                     were most cordially and affectionately received, and congratulated upon their
                     final escape and safe arrival.</p>
                  <p>Three hours after they arrived, the good old Mr. Maitland entered the house. He
                     was "a privileged visitor," he said, and did not wait upon etiquette for the
                     opportunity to shake old friends by the hand. He was overjoyed at meeting
                     George Hargreve, and he was honest in his greeting. He had no reason or motive
                     in being otherwise.</p>
                  <p>"And a charming Indian bird you have brought home with you, my boy," continued
                     Mr. Maitland, happily, as he took the two little hands of the beautiful Katrin.
                     "O, don't mind me," he added, as the girl exhibited a diffidence at his
                     pleasantry; "don't mind me. I am an old Indiaman, myself. I knew your father
                     well, and have made many a rupee out of him, and with him. I introduced George
                     to your father, by letter, when he went out to Calcutta, first, now eighteen
                     months and more ago. And don't you thank me for it, eh?"</p>
                  <p>"O, then, very much," said Katrin. "And you knew my father?"</p>
                  <p>"Very well indeed, and I regret to learn of his death. I am not surprised that
                     you ran away, George, with this treasure. I claim the privilege, remember, when
                     you are ready for it, to furnish the cage to put her in. You've got the bird,
                     I'll provide the cage, recollect."</p>
                  <p>"Thanks, sir, thanks. I understand you," said Hargreve.</p>
                  <p>"Now, come down to Sunnyside, too, right away. To-morrow, and stay a month. I
                     have everything to say to you. Bring Katchum, Katrum, here—what did you say the
                     name was?"</p>
                  <p>"Katrin, sir, <emph>Katrin.</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"Never mind, then, Katrin. A very pretty name, too, upon my word. Will you come
                     to Sunnyside?"</p>
                  <p>"Most assuredly," said Hargreve.</p>
                  <p>"To-morrow?"</p>
                  <p>"If you insist."</p>
                  <p>"By all means! You've nothing now to do, but to visit and rest, and we've
                     nothing at all to do, at Sunnyside, you know, but to entertain our friends. So
                     I rely upon you for a month at the least, and forthwith."</p>
                  <p>There was no resisting this pleasant and earnest invitation, and George
                     promised to take Katrin over with him, on the following evening.</p>
                  <p>His original purpose had been to have married the runaway beauty, and brought
                     her home <emph>his wife.</emph> But a hundred occurrences prevented this
                     intention; and when they arrived at Paris, he proposed its further
                     postponement, if Katrin were content, until they should reach his friends and
                     relatives, under the circumstances.</p>
                  <p>To this she readily assented, and they now found themselves in the midst of
                     George's associates, where the lovely foreigner found scores of ready friends,
                     and more than <emph>one</emph> admirer!</p>

                  <head type="sub">"RIVERDALE."</head>
                  <p>WHEN the family party went forth upon their morning's ride, from the broad
                     terrace of the estate at Sunnyside, which we described in the opening chapter
                     of this story, we did not call the attention of our readers to a quiet and
                     pretty nook that made up into a sort of bend in the upper road which the
                     Maitlands and their friends then traversed—a crescent, at the westerly side of
                     Mr. Maitland's broad domain—which was known, from its situation, as
                        <emph>Riverdale.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>This estate was originally the property of an affluent neighbor, but had been
                     purchased of him by Mr. Maitland, latterly, and had been very beautifully
                     refitted and ornamented, to suit his own generous tastes and fancy. The
                     grounds, and walks, and drives, and gardens of Riverdale had all been renovated
                     and remodelled. New conservatories had been built by Mr. Maitland, a variety of
                     exquisite statuary had been placed in sightly and appropriate spots over the
                     grounds, fountains had been established, the buildings and stables and lodges
                     had all been refurnished and put in perfect order and Riverdale, though
                     comparatively modest in dimensions and area, was a very delightful and pretty
                     estate. The chief roads were all opened into the main drive-ways that
                     communicated with Sunnyside, and the stranger there would suppose, from
                     appearances, that both belonged to the same estate.</p>
                  <p>What his purpose was, in purchasing and rejuvenating this beautiful place, no
                     one knew, for he never afforded any one the slightest information on the
                     subject. His wealth was immense, and his income very great, and he chose to
                     expend his money when and where it pleased his taste and leisure.</p>
                  <p>The affairs of Mr. Hargreve, senior, suddenly assumed a new turn, entirely.
                     About the time that he received the sum due to his son, from the owners of the
                     Sea Gull, one of his principal debtors—a man for whom he had become responsible
                     in a large amount—who was honest in principle, but unable to pay, became the
                     heir, very unexpectedly to a handsome portion, in the funds. Like an honorable
                     merchant as he was, he came forward at once, and not only relieved Hargreve
                     from his future liabilities for his account, but immediately paid over to him
                     the entire amount he had before disbursed for him, with interest! At about the
                     same time, a fortunate investment had been made by Mr. Hargreve which turned
                     him out a splendid profit, and he was able to get along admirably, and refund,
                     in bank, to his son's future order, every shilling he had used of his money.
                     When young Hargreve arrived in Southampton, therefore, he found a credit to his
                     account in the Branch Bank of England there, for nearly forty-five thousand
                     pounds! A matter which very agreeably surprised prised him, but which did not
                     come amiss he thought, after the circumstances had been explained to him by his
                     father.</p>
                  <p>"When I came to settle your affairs of the Sea Gull with her owners," concluded
                     his parent, "I offered my old friend Maitland such amount as was his due; but
                     he denied having any claim upon you, George. How is this?"</p>
                  <p>"More than I know," said the lieutenant.</p>
                  <p>"Not a penny of the money would he touch, nevertheless!"</p>
                  <p>"I owe him eleven thousand pounds, and a year's interest on it,
                     notwithstanding," replied George, entirely at a loss to comprehend this.</p>
                  <p>"Maitland said to me, 'use the money, Hargreve. When the boy returns, I will
                     arrange any affairs that exist between us to our own satisfaction. Use the
                     money. I have no possible use with it; you have.' And he would not take a
                     shilling of it, in any way."</p>
                  <p>"That accounts for this large amount to my credit, then, I see. I supposed I
                     had made about twenty thousand pounds upon the outward and homeward voyages;
                     but I have done much better than this, even deducting the amount of twelve
                     thousand due to Mr. Maitland."</p>
                  <p>"Yes. Your cargo came in opportunely, and sold excellently well. You did better
                     than you calculated."</p>
                  <p>"Well, I will adjust the whole matter with Mr. Maitland, at our leisure; he is
                     very liberal," said George, and he started for Sunnyside, as he had agreed.
                     Katrin joined him, and they found the people there very anxiously awaiting
                     them. They were cordially welcomed, the weather was delightful, and there was
                     ample promise of present enjoyment before them.</p>
                  <p>Riverdale had been re-fashioned by Maitland, with the intention of presenting
                     it to Mr. Hargreve, senior, whom he desired should be located near him; he had
                     no idea that George was so near to being married, while he was doing this; but
                     when he returned, and Maitland learned of his intentions in this respect, he
                     changed his purpose at once, and resolved to give this place to his
                        <emph>nephew</emph> and provide another for the foster-father and old
                     friend. But he reserved, for the future, all his amiable plans, and did not
                     speak to any one, at present, about them.</p>
                  <p>Katrin's presence at Sunnyside acted like a charm upon the gay circle of
                     visitors there. There was so much of romance in her history, as they had
                     briefly learned its details, that the ladies were delighted with her, though
                     some who met her there, envied her her gentleness and glorious beauty. The
                     gentlemen, old and young, were in ecstacies about her. Within a few days, the
                     romantic news had spread around, and a throng of fashion crowded to Sunnyside,
                     for several days, subsequently.</p>
                  <p>During this visit, George Hargreve thought of the interview he had had in
                     Calcutta, with the strange doctor, when he was lying at Rajab's bungalow, and
                     he suddenly asked Mr. Maitland one day:</p>
                  <p>"Did you ever know one Maylock, or Mairlock, sir—who dwelt in this region,
                     twenty years ago?"</p>
                  <p>"No," said Maitland. "There was a Marlock, here, I think, some years
                     since."</p>
                  <p>"That is it, I was mistaken. Marlock, I mean."</p>
                  <p>"Why did you ask?"</p>
                  <p>"Nothing particular, sir. There was a Glessin also—Henry Glessin, too; was
                     there not?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, yes," said Maitland, astonished at these queries.</p>
                  <p>"Since you have been kind enough to reply so promptly," said Hargreve, "I will
                     tell you why I have thus questioned you."</p>
                  <p>"I am very desirous to know."</p>
                  <p>"Well, then—when I was lying at Calcutta, with my broken limb, there came a
                     doctor in disguise, to see me, who proved to be an Englishman. He observed a
                     mark upon my shoulder, an old scar, which he pretended to recognize; and
                     finally declared to me that my name was <emph>not</emph> Hargreve, but
                        <emph>Glessin</emph>—that is, Glessin was my natural parent, and Hargreve
                     was only my foster-father, who had adopted me, when an infant."</p>
                  <p>"This is very remarkable," said Maitland.</p>
                  <p>"But what was more so, sir," continued Hargreve, in a low tone, "he finally
                     declared to me that <emph>he</emph> was no other than <emph>that same Henry
                        Glessin!</emph>"</p>
                  <p>Maitland started up. "It is not unlikely," he said. "The poor fellow wandered
                     away from home, none knew whither; and he probably brought up at Calcutta. What
                     has become of him?"</p>
                  <p>"I never saw him after he declared himself to me," said Hargreve. "Is this
                     truth, or romance?" continued the youth, deeply interested.</p>
                  <p>"The facts are correct. Who this man was, however, I do not know."</p>
                  <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC5953-00000036"/>
                  <p>"Do you mean to say that Mr. Hargreve is <emph>not</emph> my father, sir?"</p>
                  <p>"This is even so, George—though he has been to you all that a father could have
                     been, surely."</p>
                  <p>"And so do I esteem him, sir," responded the youth, earnestly.</p>
                  <p>"Well, George," continued Mr. Maitland, "since this subject is now fairly
                     broached, I will tell you further of the history of the Glessin mystery. Sophia
                     Glessin—your mother—was my own sister."</p>
                  <p>"Your sister, sir!"</p>
                  <p>"Yes. The marriage was an unfortunate one, she ran away with Henry, who was not
                     worthy of her. She died, when you were three years old; and you
                        <emph>were</emph> subsequently adopted, through Marlock's agency, by your
                     present foster-father, Mr. Hargreve."</p>
                  <p>The details that the reader has already learned, were then recounted to George,
                     by Maitland, who claimed that as he had done what little he had, towards
                        <emph>his own nephew,</emph> the lieutenant should not murmur or refuse to
                     accept his gift; and it was agreed that nothing more should be said about the
                     money which was on deposit to George's credit, but that it should be
                        <emph>his,</emph> principal and interest, to which the youth assented.</p>
                  <p>It was also arranged that nothing farther should transpire in reference to the
                     Glessin affair, at present—and the private conference between the uncle and
                     nephew terminated, just as they were notified that the horses were in readiness
                     for a drive.</p>
                  <p>"We will visit Riverdale," said Maitland, "Come, George, let me show you the
                     prettiest spot in the whole country," he continued. And five minutes afterward,
                     the party were on the avenue toward the newly appointed country seat.</p>
                  <p>The villa—or mansion rather—was situated upon a handsome knoll, and was built
                     in the Gothic style. Upon the southerly side of the sweeping lawn that graced
                     the front of the dwelling, there wound a beautiful river, which emptied itself
                     far away to the west, into Hamble Creek.</p>
                  <p>The domain belonging to these premises embraced many acres, which were located
                     principally along the valley, or dale-side, of the river, and hence the very
                     appropriate name given to the estate. It was a charming spot, with its rich
                     green fields, its beautiful groves of trees, its park and elegantly furnished
                     grounds, and young Hargreve was delighted with it.</p>
                  <p>"To what purpose do you propose to appropriate this newly-acquired spot?"
                     inquired Hargreve, after it had been examined.</p>
                  <p>"I propose to make it a wedding-gift to a young lady-friend of mine," said
                     Maitland, "who is shortly to be married."</p>
                  <p>Hargreve did not "take!" But he again declared that Maitland was exceedingly
                     liberal with his surplus fortune!</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE JEWELLED BROACH.</head>
                  <p>THE casket which old Rajab presented to his daughter on her fifteenth birthday,
                     and which has already been spoken of, contained a magnificent jewelled broach,
                     of great value. But, so common were these ornaments in India, comparatively, at
                     that period, that Katrin had very seldom worn this, being little inclined to a
                     fancy for such display. The broach had been carefully preserved, however, with
                     her other jewels—with which the East Indian ladies are usually profusely
                     supplied, in proportion to their station and wealth—but she had no idea
                     whatever of its intrinsic value; nor had she ever thought at all about the
                     matter, until her arrival in England.</p>
                  <p>Her nuptials were now approaching, but she could bring to her husband no dowry,
                     though her father had been—and her mother was, at that moment—in the enjoyment
                     of immense riches; but from which she had been unceremoniously cut off. Yet she
                     did bring to the altar a virgin heart of purity, a brighter, costlier, richer
                     jewel, far, than all the diamonds of India, in itself. It was all that Hargreve
                     craved. He was well situated, pecuniarily, and needed nothing but what fortune
                     had so suddenly poured into his lap. Still, there was a latent feeling of
                     pride, with Katrin, and she would have been glad, could she have felt that she
                     could contribute to the possessions of her lover something, on her wedding-day,
                     that would be substantial and acceptable to him, though the amount should not
                     be great.</p>
                  <p>She took her casket down, one day, and examined the contents. It contained her
                     father's last gift, and it was heavy and elegant. She had no conception of its
                     value, but she said, "I do not need this bauble. My father became possessor of
                     these jewels, so he told me, through a laborer in the northern mines—and I have
                     heard and read that in this English clime, round sums are often paid for
                     diamonds and rubies. This setting is not in vogue, here, I observe—and I will
                     have it altered. I may, by this means learn the trinket's value, haply," and
                     she placed it in Hargreve's hands, soon after, with the request that he would
                     hand it to a responsible jeweller, for resetting.</p>
                  <p>"It is the ruby broach I told you of, George," she said, "and was the last gift
                     my father ever made me—peace to his ashes! It may be valuable, for aught I
                     know, and your jeweller will tell us of its worth."</p>
                  <p>In accordance with this request, Hargreve took the casket to a dealer in gems,
                     and requested to have the stones reset and modernized. He was surprised to
                     observe, as soon as the jeweller beheld it, that he called his partner up to
                     examine it, and to hear their sudden exclamations at its extraordinary
                     beauty.</p>
                  <p>"Where did this come from?" inquired the principal.</p>
                  <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC5953-00000037"/>
                  <p>"From India, sir," said Hargreve, "and it is thought to be valuable."</p>
                  <p>"It is superb!" exclaimed the jewellers, both together. "No such ruby as this
                     centre gem appears to be, has ever been seen, I think, in England! Is it for
                     sale?"</p>
                  <p>"No, sir, no," replied Hargreve, instantly. "It is the property of a lady from
                     Calcutta, who is now on a visit to this country, who has noticed that its
                     setting is not fashionable, I believe, and who desires it changed."</p>
                  <p>"Could she not be induced to dispose of the ruby?" continued the jeweller,
                     evidently anxious to possess this magnificent gem, the equal of which he had
                     never seen approached.</p>
                  <p>"I think not, sir, but I can ask the question. Perhaps she would part with it,
                     for a good consideration, however."</p>
                  <p>"We are ready to negociate for it," responded the trader in jewels, "and will
                     pay its full value, which is very considerable, if it can be sold."</p>
                  <p>Hargreve promised to call again, with it, and taking the casket, retired.</p>
                  <p>As soon as he left the jeweller's premises, he passed down the principal
                     street, crossed to the Jews' quarter of the town, and found an old man who was
                     reputed to be well acquainted with the value of this sort of property—but who
                     did not know the person of young Hargreve at all. The lieutenant entered,
                     looked about him a moment, drew forth the casket, and taking out the broach,
                     placed it before the old man.</p>
                  <p>"What is this worth, my friend?" asked Hargreve, as he presented the cluster
                     upon his counter.</p>
                  <p>The old Jew took it, without much apparent care, at first, turned it over,
                     walked to the light, and started, as if something had struck him very sensibly,
                     on a sudden.</p>
                  <p>"How came you by this?" he demanded, sharply.</p>
                  <p>"That will be no affair of yours, sir," responded George, in return. "I am not
                     here to answer questions, but for commercial information. I asked you, as a
                     matter of business, what is the trinket's value?"</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Trinket!</emph>" exclaimed the Jew, clutching the broach firmly in his
                     swarthy hand, "do you call that ruby a trinket? Come, you are a stranger. Shut
                     the doors!" screamed the Jew, "we will see about this trinket."</p>
                  <p>Hargreve protested against this unexpected and extraordinary treatment, and
                     upon hearing the order given to close the door, he imagined that he had come
                     upon a den of robbers, unawares, who would seize the gem, and murder him,
                     perhaps, on the spot!</p>
                  <p>"Give me the casket," he shouted, "or I will bring down upon you the vengeance
                     of the law."</p>
                  <p>"When you show where you obtained its contents," said the Jew, "not before. Do
                     you know that this ruby is not equalled by the proudest gem of its kind that
                     graces the costliest coronet in all this kingdom? It has been stolen,
                     sir—stolen, from some crown! Answer then, whence you got it, or we hand you
                     over to the authorities, with this evidence against you."</p>
                  <p>"My name is Hargreve, old man," said George, at last, disposed to avoid any
                     unnecessary scene or trouble. "I am lately from India. My father is a resident
                     merchant of Southampton, here, and you should know him, surely. The broach is
                     the private property of a Hindoo lady, now in town, who is under my protection,
                     and whose father, Sedd Rajab of Calcutta, was one of the wealthiest merchants
                     of that country."</p>
                  <p>"This is a charming story, young man; but we are looked upon by the community
                     with suspicion, as everybody well knows, and we must be guarded in our conduct.
                     You may be honest, and your representations may be correct, but we must have
                     evidence of it, our duty requires us to hand you, and this valuable property,
                     over to the care of the police."</p>
                  <p>Here was a precious dilemma for young Hargreve, with his jewelled "trinket!"
                     But he said:</p>
                  <p>"Will you send for my father?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes?" said the Jews, "yes, if you mean so," and rather more surprised than
                     before, they took Mr. Hargreve senior's address, and became more polite and
                     civil, at once.</p>
                  <p>"All I ask of you now, is," said George, "that when my father appears, whom you
                     will undoubtedly recognize as one of our citizens, whose name only you did not
                     know, you will not permit him to learn anything of my business here. He will
                     tell you who I am, but I do not want the lady to know that I attempted to
                        <emph>price</emph> this jewel, which she gave me to have reset only."</p>
                  <p>In a very few minutes, Mr. Hargreve entered the store, and a satisfactory
                     explanation followed, the principal of the establishment remembering his face
                     for many years, previously. Apologies were offered, and congratulations
                     succeeded, in spite of the lieutenant's warning and request.</p>
                  <p>"You have asked the jewel's value, sir," said the old Jew, "and I will tell you
                     that, if it be for sale, we will give more for it than any other house in
                     England."</p>
                  <p>"It is not for sale," said George. "But what offer will you make for it, if it
                     is?"</p>
                  <p>The Jews both took it up, again—examined the great flashing brilliants that
                     surrounded the superb ruby in the centre, re-examined it, and replied:</p>
                  <p>"Will you not permit us to see this at our leisure, sir? We will receipt for
                     it, and—"</p>
                  <p>"I shall not suffer it to go out of my sight, sir, of course," said Hargreve,
                     "since it has proved so valuable."</p>
                  <p>"Will you tarry here, and be seated a few minutes, then," continued the
                     foremost of them, while we send for our lapidary?"</p>
                  <p>Hargreve consented, and an ancient lynx-eyed fellow soon after appeared, to
                     whose hands and inspection the broach was submitted.</p>
                  <p>He turned it over, poised it between his fingers, examined it faithfully, and
                     said, "itish'an'some, very."</p>
                  <p>The trio of worthies then put their heads together, for consultation. Hargreve
                     had got wearied with their "backing and filling," as he called it, and demanded
                     the casket and its contents.</p>
                  <p>"Ish dis for shale?" asked the old lapidary, as he came forward wtth the box
                     and broach.</p>
                  <p>"No, sir, no!"</p>
                  <p>"Vot shum will purshas it, den?"</p>
                  <p>"Nothing. I am not at liberty to part with it, at any price. Will
                        you—<emph>can</emph> you tell me its market value?"</p>
                  <p>"Vell," said the lapidary, slowly, "I am not a merchant, I do not buy. Mr.
                     Moshes, here, might pay shix thousand poun's for dis, if it can be shold."</p>
                  <p>"Six thousand pounds!" exclaimed Hargreve.</p>
                  <p>"Yes, dat ish, for the sheven brilliants, and the big red shtone."</p>
                  <p>Hargreve placed the casket in his breast-pocket and turned to go out.</p>
                  <p>"Before you dispose of it, you will call again, sir, will you not?" asked Mr.
                     Moses.</p>
                  <p>"I will see, when the jewels are for sale," replied George; and with his
                     treasure, he made the best of his way out of the Southampton Jews' <foreign

                  <head>CHAPTER XXV.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE HINDOO GIRL'S DOWRY.</head>
                  <p>WHEN Hargreve returned home with his lady's treasure, he informed Katrin that
                     he had not left it to be re-fashioned, because he had unexpectedly discovered
                     that the broach was of such high value that he did not like to trust it in
                     strange hands; and he desired, moreover, to know what were Katrin's views in
                     reference to its disposal, provided he had not been misinformed regarding its
                     probable value.</p>
                  <p>"Sell it, by all means, George," said Katrin, instantly. "I have no possible
                     need of it, and have smaller jewels in plenty, if I fancy them at all. I
                     supposed it had an intrinsic value, but you know I have never had occasion, or
                     the opportunity, to look into such business matters. When my father presented
                     this to me, I recollect he said something about his belief that the stones were
                     very choice; that is all I ever heard or thought about it. The broach was
                     always too large and heavy for my taste, and I think I never wore it but
                     thrice. Sell it, for me, whenever you think proper."</p>
                  <p>George Hargreve repaired to the establishment where he had first shown the
                     broach, and inquired what the jewellers were willing to pay for it.</p>
                  <p>"Well, sir," said the principal, "since you were here, we have mentioned this
                     matter to another house, and we propose to purchase it, jointly, at its fair
                     value. It is far more costly a jewel than you have any idea of, probably—and no
                     house in Southampton would care to risk its purchase, alone."</p>
                  <p>"What can you give for it?"</p>
                  <p>"Well, then, I am authorized to offer you ten thousand sterling, for the star.
                     The ruby is worth four thousand pounds. The brilliants about a thousand pounds,
                     each, sir."</p>
                  <p>Hargreve saw that Katrin had a fortune, after all!</p>
                  <p>"Is this ruby worth no more than the sum you have named, gentlemen?" Examine
                     it, once more. Do you observe the large deep-colored centre?"</p>
                  <p>"Well, we will not price an article that we desire to purchase. Will you name
                     what you ask for it?"</p>
                  <p>"I will not sell the ruby short of ten thousand pounds, gentleman!" said
                     Hargreve, firmly. "At the first European coronation, I will get twice that sum
                     for it, from a London house, I am sure."</p>
                  <p>"And the diamonds?" inquired the jeweller.</p>
                  <p>"Those I will reserve."</p>
                  <p>"Well, Mr. Hargreve, the value of this precious stone is great, but uncertain.
                     We have never yet seen anything that rivalled it, in size and purity. As you
                     have remarked, a prince or king alone could afford to buy and keep it, and such
                     a patron might, in time, be found for it. We will remove the ruby, and pay you
                     the price you have now named for it."</p>
                  <p>Hargreve took a check for the amount, gave an order to have the diamonds
                     handsomely reset, and half an hour afterwards paid over to the astonished
                     Katrin ten thousand pound notes of the bank of England, for the principal jewel
                     of her broach.</p>
                  <p>Within six months from that day, the fortunate purchasers resold this splendid
                     gem to a German prince, for twice ten thousand guineas, and it now ornaments a
                     European crown!</p>
                  <p>This little fortune was deposited in the English funds, at interest, and Katrin
                     was very much happier to know that she was not a pauper. She could now present
                     her husband with a very pretty dowry; and she reserved the gift for her
                     wedding-day.</p>
                  <p>Hargreve soon afterwards found himself again at Sunnyside, enjoying the
                     hospitality of his kind friend and uncle—Maitland.</p>
                  <p>"I hear," said the old gentleman, "that you are soon to wed the beautiful
                     Indian girl you brought home with you, George?"</p>
                  <p>"You are right, sir."</p>
                  <p>"It is very proper you should do so," continued Mr. Maitland; "and the sooner
                     the better. You are now possessed of a comfortable fortune, and I propose to
                     enlighten you a little. You remember Riverdale?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, sir—with great pleasure. It is a delightful spot."</p>
                  <p>"I told you, I think, that I intended that place as a marriage-gift to a young
                     lady-friend of mine; did I not?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I think so."</p>
                  <p>"It will be a marriage portion for your Katrin, when she weds my nephew," added
                     Maitland. "Shall we not ride over once more, and examine it, at our leisure,
                     George?"</p>
                  <p>They wandered over the beautifully ornamented grounds, and through the
                     oak-shadowed avenues of Riverdale, where everything that was agreeable to the
                     eye greeted them, from point to point, as they sauntered on, in happy
                     conversation.</p>
                  <p>They passed over the elegantly furnished mansion, too, and Hargreve could
                     suggest no improvement, no addition whatever, to the tasteful and generous
                     appointments of the dwelling.</p>
                  <p>Hargreve was again astonished, but he joined his friend, and they proceeded to
                     the villa, at once.</p>
                  <p>"Here, George," continued Mr. Maitland, "here, beneath these spacious groves,
                     in the midst of this convenient and comfortable arrangement, I think you can
                     enjoy life, agreeably. You will be my near neighbor, when you take possession
                     here, and I shall have the satisfaction of seeing you enjoy yourself, with your
                     youthful and peerless wife, as few persons can ordinarily hope to do. But you
                     have been peculiarly fortunate, of late, and I rejoice at your success. This is
                     the 'cage' I spoke to you of; when you are ready, deposit your beautiful bird
                     within it, and may you be as happy with this gift as I am in being able to
                     bestow it upon so worthy a recipient."</p>
                  <p>"This shall be <emph>Katrin's,</emph> then, sir?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes; I have so provided, in the deed of it. When do you wed?"</p>
                  <p>"Within this month, sir."</p>
                  <p>"And where?"</p>
                  <p>"At my father's house."</p>
                  <p>"I do not like that arrangement so well. I shall offer no serious interference,
                     but I propose that you shall be married at Sunnyside, and I will give away the
                     bride—why not?"</p>
                  <p>"I presume there will be no objection to this, if you desire it so, my dear
                     sir."</p>
                  <p>"Then so be it. I will see your father, in the meantime. Your family will all
                     join us here, and the plan will much better suit my fancy."</p>
                  <p>This was the final arrangement, then; and young Hargreve proceeded to carry out
                     his uncle's generous intentions. The family of Hargreve were rather pleased,
                     than otherwise, with the idea, and it was settled that the wedding of George
                     and Katrin should be solemnized at the beautiful mansion of John Maitland,
                     Esq.</p>
                  <p>The magnificent wardrobe that Katrin had taken with her from India, had been
                     lost in the Emperor, but she did not lack for anything after reaching
                     England—and she was now busy in preparation for her nuptials, which were to
                     take place at Sunnyside within a week.</p>
                  <p>George Hargreve had as yet said nothing to his parents, or to Maitland, about
                     his business intentions after he should be married. But he purposed another
                     venture in the East! There were two reasons that induced him to entertain the
                     idea of another voyage to China; the first was to increase his worldly means to
                     what he then deemed would be a satisfactory sum to live upon, at home—and the
                     second was to ascertain whether, under the Indo-British laws of Calcutta (in
                     case of the death of Katrin's mother), the<pb n="78-79"
                        xml:id="VAC5953-00000039"/> daughter could not be made recognizable as the
                     rightful future heir of the immense estate which it was known Sedd Rajab left
                     at his decease.</p>
                  <p>These two objects, but especially the last named, were of consequence to him;
                     and he thought they were worth the time and trouble that would be required for
                     looking after the results. He proposed to purchase an interest in some
                     outward-bound Indiaman, at his convenient leisure, after the wedding, and to
                     proceed to Canton and Calcutta once more, for these purposes.</p>
                  <p>How this determination on his part would be received by his wife (that was to
                     be), and by his uncle, and parents, he did not know! But he made up his mind to
                     carry out his plan—and his nuptial-day at length came round.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE BRIDE AT SUNNYSIDE.</head>
                  <p>A line of splendid equipages had passed up the great avenue, and had deposited
                     their burthens at the broad terrace that fronted the mansion of the Maitlands,
                     at Sunnyside. The occasion which drew so many of the friends of Mr. Maitland
                     together, had been the topic of conversation in the fashionable circle of
                     Southampton, and vicinity, for several days, and the wedding of the season, the
                     nuptials of Katrin, the "belle of the Orient," with Lieutenant George Hargreve,
                     late of the H. B. M. Navy, was to be consummated on that evening.</p>
                  <p>The Hindoo beauty had had no hint of what remained in store for her, as soon as
                     she responded to the name of Mrs. Hargreve, neither Maitland nor her lover
                     having mentioned a syllable to her in regard to the intention of the former,
                     respecting Riverdale. While, at the same time, Katrin had contrived a little
                     surprise for her future husband; which she proposed to present to him, in the
                     shape of a certified check on the bank of England, for the sum of ten thousand
                     guineas.</p>
                  <p>"Isn't this a delightful romance?" said a beautiful English lady to a friend
                     present, alluding to the approaching marriage.</p>
                  <p>"It is, indeed," was the response. "Have you met the bride?"</p>
                  <p>"O, yes; and a delightful person she is, too."</p>
                  <p>"I have not seen her, yet. She is called pretty."</p>
                  <p>"Beautiful, upon my word! A very <foreign xml:lang="FRA">houri</foreign> in her
                     personal charms, and as good as she is comely."</p>
                  <p>"What is her story?"</p>
                  <p>"A curious one, very—have you never heard it?"</p>
                  <p>"Not authentically. We have it that she is a runaway Hindoo girl; young,
                     impulsive, rich as Crœsus, dark-eyed, jewel-bedizzened—and all that—eh?"</p>
                  <p>"Well. The lady is young, not yet twenty, and Hargreve, who was supercargo on
                     board an Indiaman, some months ago, met her with her father—one Rajab—on the
                     passage out from Calcutta to Heang Keang. They became enamored of each other,
                     and returned together to Calcutta, subsequently, where their intimacy was
                     renewed. Old Rajab frowned upon the suit, and Hargreve, like a true Briton,
                     pushed his claim the more earnestly. He met with an accident—"</p>
                  <p>"Of course," said the other.</p>
                  <p>"No, it was true. He was borne to Rajab's house, in a very critical state, and
                     his vessel came home without him. She attended him."</p>
                  <p>"Yes, I see?"</p>
                  <p>"And when he recovered, the old man continued ued obdurate, and refused to
                     listen to her or him. The girl renounced the Hindoo religion, and embraced
                     Christianity. Old Rajab, her father, suddenly died, at length—"</p>
                  <p>"Poisoned?" queried the other.</p>
                  <p>"No, no! From some internal disease, of long standing, I hear."</p>
                  <p>"And what then?"</p>
                  <p>"Why Hargreve took the beauty and her fortune, I presume, and sailed for
                     London. Why not?"</p>
                  <p>"To be sure, why not? Bravo! George Hargreve," exclaimed the lady's friend,
                     "you acted like a man, and a bonnie Englishman! May your happiness be
                     commensurate with your highest expectations!"</p>
                  <p>The entire resources of Maitland's splendid and extensive establishment were
                     brought into requisition on the happy occasion we have noted, and a gala day
                     was passing away at Sunnyside, in compliment to the bride and her marriage.
                     Never was there a happier man than was good Mr. Maitland, at this joyous event,
                     and never were the honors of such a <foreign xml:lang="FRA">fete</foreign>
                     accomplished more fully, and more to the entire happiness of the guests, than
                     was this elegant and well-planned entertainment.</p>
                  <p>A grand feast was given in the grove, at the southerly side of the estate,
                     which was managed by the chief butler, and to which the neighboring tenantry
                     were invited. Here a merry party gathered, who drank long life to Maitland and
                     the lovers, in swimming bumpers, and made the welkin ring with their joy and
                     hilarity.</p>
                  <p>The grand drawing-room of the mansion was at length thrown open, and the guests
                     were summoned from the gardens and the walks, to witness the final ceremonies
                     that had drawn them to Sunnyside. The priest was in attendance, and shortly
                     after they were seated, the ante-room door was opened, and the bride and groom
                     entered, flanked by half a score of satin-trailed bridesmaids, and as many
                     fashionably attired groomsmen. The nuptials were soon performed, after the
                     ordinary English Protestant church service, and George and Katrin were quickly
                     made one in marriage.</p>
                  <p>Never did the lovely Hindoo girl look so winsome as on this evening, when she
                     gave her hand to the only man she had ever loved. Her fair form was richly
                     veiled, but her charms could yet be seen to admirable advantage, beneath the
                     frail Mechlin film that enveloped her face and figure. There was joy at
                     Sunnyside, and verily George Hargreve was heartily envied the possession of so
                     gentle and beautiful a bride.</p>
                  <p>"Isn't she lovely?" said an Etonian, to a dashing beau who was looking at the
                     young wife through his glass, as she curtesied gracefully to the
                     congratulations of the company, "by Jove! she's the sweetest woman I ever saw,
                     I think, in my life."</p>
                  <p>The more experienced Londoner replied, "fairish, fairish. She'll
                        <emph>do.</emph>"</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Do!</emph> Did you ever see so beautiful a girl?"</p>
                  <p>"O, yes, many of 'em. You haven't been about much, Tommy, my boy, you know,"
                     continued the beau, who had been jilted for the third time, at least, of late.
                     "I've seen a great many ladies, in my day; <emph>I</emph> have. She's
                     fair—pretty—so, so-ish. Rather <emph>yallow,</emph> I think. But she'll pass,
                     certainly."</p>
                  <p>But no one else heard this cavalier opinion, and nobody would have noticed it,
                     if they had! So that matters were not much changed on account of this show of
                     jealousy.</p>
                  <p>Music and dancing succeeded the wedding. A superb supper was announced at ten,
                     and an hour afterwards, the newly wedded pair departed from Sunnyside for
                     Riverdale, accompanied by George's family relatives, and an appropriate retinue
                     of attendants.</p>
                  <p>On the following evening, Mr. Maitland sent over the deed of Riverdale, with a
                     request that Katrin would accept that estate as a marriage gift from him. She
                     had already placed in her husband's hands the ten thousand pounds he had
                     received for the ruby, and young Hargreve now found himself master of nearly
                     sixty thousand guineas sterling, besides the estate which Maitland had
                     presented to his wife. Under such fortunate pecuniary circumstances, was it not
                     strange that he still insisted upon another India voyage?</p>
                  <p>Yet such was the fact! Within one month from the night of his marriage, he
                     announced his purpose to Katrin, and subsequently he informed his father and
                     Mr. Maitland that he should soon depart for the East again.</p>
                  <p>This was a matter of great surprise to Maitland and his foster-parent, who
                     opposed it strenuously—but without avail. George had resolved and he could not
                     be induced to alter his purpose.</p>
                  <p>He explained himself to them, but Maitland contended that he did not need the
                     money he might realize, while his chances for securing any portion of old
                     Rajab's property, under the circumstances, were very vague and unpromising.</p>
                  <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC5953-00000040"/>
                  <p>The perils to be encountered were too great, and it was urged that he had much
                     better remain at home with his lovely young wife, than to brave the jeopardy,
                     for an uncertain prospect of good from it.</p>
                  <p>All their objections were listened to, but George Hargreve had determined to go
                     to Canton, again—and he could not be tempted to swerve from his resolve.</p>
                  <p>He commenced looking about for the opportunity of investing a few thousand
                     pounds in such a venture, and he was not long in hearing of a good chance. A
                     fine new ship was up for Bombay and Calcutta, at Southampton, and he
                     immediately commenced negociating for a fourth interest in her.</p>
                  <p>His present adventure was about to be invested in the Marathon, a noble vessel,
                     and he arranged for a portion of her space for freight which he proposed to
                     take out, also, upon private account. Everything passed on well enough, his
                     business was duly despatched, his goods were got on board seasonably, and he
                     was finally ready to take his departure, once more, for the land of the
                     Hindoo—when his loving and gentle wife interposed her last objections to his
                     undertaking this seemingly unnecessary and perilous trip.</p>

               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">HARGREVE IN JEOPARDY.</head>
                  <p>THE family and friends of Katrin had no means of knowing what had become of
                     her, after the receipt of her brief letter, which reached the house of old
                     Rajab the day following that upon which the Emperor left Calcutta. The sudden
                     absence of young Hargreve, however, and the departure of the ship from the
                     port, for the West, soon satisfied the old lady that her daughter had fled with
                     the youthful Englishman.</p>
                  <p>She was exasperated beyond measure that her only child should have thus been
                     induced to renounce her religion, and elope with a foreigner, but she could not
                     recall her. Though she entertained but a very slight feeling of solid affection
                     for her daughter, she deemed this step a lasting and external disgrace upon the
                     family; and in her superstitious ignorance, she believed that the destroyer,
                     Vishnu, would be avenged upon her child, for this contumely and recklessness.
                     The fortune which her husband had left her, was a very comfortable substitute,
                     however, for the loss of old Rajab and the daughter—and the wife soon got to be
                     resigned to her circumstances. She became quiet, and spoke little about her
                     double bereavement, but determined, nevertheless—if ever the opportunity
                     presented—to be avenged for the imaginary injury she had sustained.</p>
                  <p>When Hargreve was about to leave England the second time, for the East, his
                     young wife besought him to relinquish his design. She feared the perils of the
                     voyage, but she assured Hargreve that his life would be jeopardized, in a
                     thousand other ways—if he ever showed himself again in Calcutta. She knew the
                     customs and the treachery of her people, much better than he did, and she
                     warned him to avoid the danger he must of necessity encounter by revisiting
                     that place. She knew her mother's disposition, too, and she begged him to
                     reflect upon the perils that would surround him, from the hour he landed in
                     India, if the wife of Rajab should be cognisant of his presence there. But to
                     all this zeal, he responded that he feared nothing; he should go cautiously and
                     act circumspectly, and would return to his home again a rich man, and probably
                     secure to his wife the rights in her father's estate which so clearly belonged
                     to her. He would go, and go he did!</p>
                  <p>About four months from the day of this interview between the young married
                     couple, the ship in which Hargreve embarked came to anchor off Calcutta. The
                     mother of Katrin had had in her employ, constantly, since the fugitives left
                     India, a trusty spy, whose business it had been to watch the arrival of every
                     vessel that came into port from the west, or from China, in the hope that some
                     information might be obtained of the<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC5953-00000041"/>
                     whereabouts of Katrin, if possible. She had no reason to <emph>hope,</emph>
                     even, that young Hargreve would ever fall in her way, again, though such an
                     event did not seem altogether impossible. When her agent informed her that a
                     young Englishman answering her description of Hargreve had just arrived, she
                     was overjoyed at the intelligence, and forthwith placed her minion upon the
                     young stranger's track, to learn his name. The lieutenant suspecting nothing of
                     this kind, had no hesitation in calling upon one or two acquaintances he had
                     made, and thus immediately after his arrival in Calcutta he was dogged, at
                     every step, by the secret spy in the old lady's interest.</p>
                  <p>She immediately sent for another man in whom she thought she could rely, and
                     offered him ample reward to secure the person of the lieutenant, and to dispose
                     of him, <emph>peremptorily.</emph> Her religion taught her that this
                     retaliation would be acceptable to the deity she worshipped, as she charged
                     upon Hargreve the abduction of her child, and the consequent ruin of her house.
                     She made no allowance for the probable assent of Katrin to the arrangement, but
                     resolved to take her satisfaction out of the barbarian who had thus enticed her
                     daughter from duty and from her home.</p>
                  <p>The party to whom she applied to perform the pleasant little operation of
                     strangling or drowning her son-in-law (though she did not then know he stood in
                     that relation to her at all), chanced to be the very person who had been called
                     to examine Hargreve's injuries, at the time he lay disabled in Rajab's
                     bungalow! He had attended her husband, it will be remembered, and had
                     succeeded, during the old man's last illness, in giving him temporary relief.
                     But for the terrible accident which had caused the Hindoo's death so suddenly,
                     he always declared that he could, and should, have cured him, entirely! The
                     wife believed this, and she relied upon his skill. She never lost sight of him,
                     after her husband's death; and when she desired his services—she thought she
                     knew him to be a fitting and expert tool for her purpose—she called him into
                     her presence, and made known her wishes. The remuneration was to be liberal,
                     and she conjured him to sacrifice the rebel Englishman, to appease the gods of
                     her idolatry, who had thus been outraged by the foreigner's duplicity and
                     presumption.</p>
                  <p>The medical man heard her complaint, and at once entered into an agreement to
                     put the lieutenant out of harm's way. "It is an easy thing to perform," he
                     said, "and the boy will very quickly be provided for."</p>
                  <p>"Make it certain," continued the Hindoo woman, "and speedy, too. He will not
                     tarry long to give the opportunity for our revenge."</p>
                  <p>"Count it done," said the doctor, and they parted. The good widow of old Rajab
                     was in ecstacies at the early prospect of this sacrifice!</p>
                  <p>The doctor pretended to be a good Brahminite, and the limited knowledge and
                     experience of Rajab's widow, at least, prevented her from discovering or
                     suspecting that this man was anything but what he purported to be—to wit—a
                     learned Brahmin, from Bombay, who was versed in the hidden science and
                     mysteries of healing or destroying humanity, at his pleasure.</p>
                  <p>Now this able physician had a way of his own in managing affairs, and the first
                     thing he did after he left the widow's house, was to send a confidential
                     communication of warning to young Hargreve! In his letter, which was penned in
                     good English, he bade him, if he valued his life while in Calcutta to taste of
                     no food except on board his ship, under any circumstances whatever; to be
                     careful never to be out in the streets after sunset; to avoid entering or
                     remaining for an instant in a closed room; to go constantly well-armed, and
                     never for a single moment, to be caught off his guard. The writer assured him
                     that every breath he drew was watched by his deadly enemy; and that if he
                     desired to leave India alive, he must not flout at the caution he had thus
                     given him. It was signed by "a faithful friend" whom Hargreve could not
                     suspect, but to whom, nevertheless, he felt very deeply obliged. He knew no one
                     in Calcutta who could possibly thus address him, in his native language—but he
                     had not forgotten the last words of his wife, before he left her, and he now
                     resolved to profit by the advice he had thus mysteriously received.</p>
                  <p>Hargreve felt very well assured, secretly, who "this enemy" was. He entertained
                     no doubt that the mother of Katrin, from her education, her bigotry, and her
                     native hatred of his race, was fully equal to smothering or poisoning him, at
                     second hand, for revenge or sacrifice to her "insulted gods." Yet he had no
                     fear of being trapped, and kept himself constantly on the <foreign
                        xml:lang="FRA">qui vive,</foreign> wherever he moved day and night, living
                     mostly on shipboard, and touching no food, elsewhere.</p>
                  <p>The careful and considerate widow determined to make a sure thing, of her prey;
                     and, though she confided fully in the faithfulness of her doctor, whom she had
                     engaged to prescribe for the young Englishman, still she deemed it expedient to
                     urge the assistance of her trusty spy upon the attention of her chief employee.
                     With the co-operation of the two, she thought her wishes would much more
                     effectually be accomplished, and, to this end, she made her overtures at once
                     to the man of medicine.</p>
                  <p>She appealed directly to the religious belief of her spy, and with the offer of
                     a liberal bribe, if he were successful in entrapping the foreigner, she made
                     all safe in that quarter; but the doctor acquiesced in the arrangement, fully,
                     and <unclear>laid</unclear> his counter-plans accordingly.</p>
                  <p>While the Hindoo widow was thus busily occupied in her determination to destroy
                     the object of her wrath, however, Hargreve had been quite as active and
                     energetic, during his second brief sojourn in Calcutta, in his endeavors to
                     obtain a hold, in some manner, upon such portion of Katrin's late father's
                     estate, as of right was her due. The Indo British laws in this respect, were,
                     at that time, exceedingly inefficient, however; and he found it impossible to
                     reach the matter in any legal manner. And, just as he had made up his mind, at
                     last, to yield, and give up the chase, a new and interesting turn in his
                     expectations was very suddenly presented to him!</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE OPIATE, AND WHAT FOLLOWED IT.</head>
                  <p>OUR hero had tarried in the town one evening an hour later than was his wont,
                     in pursuit of advice from a pretended lawyer whom he had consulted in his
                     cause, and who had given him encouragement that he could aid him in his efforts
                     to secure the rights of his new wife. His boat was in waiting for him, as
                     usual, and the man to whom he had confided his business did not return to the
                     place appointed so promptly as had been his custom hitherto in his
                     engagements.</p>
                  <p>The room, or office, where he awaited the return of this acquaintance, was
                     situated in a narrow street, upon the ground floor, and was accessible only
                     from a small and low front opening upon a narrower court-yard. It had got to be
                     quite evening before Hargreve was aware of it; but his anxiety to obtain some
                     decision in his learned friend's opinion, tempted him to remain beyond the time
                     he had usually permitted himself to be abroad.</p>
                  <p>He was waiting and watching for the legal adviser's return, when he suddenly
                     felt oppressed and unconquerably sleepy. He rallied an instant, turned toward
                     the door of the little room, which he now saw had been noiselessly closed,
                     attempted to rise, but was unable to get out of his chair; and a moment
                     afterwards, he fell back, sound asleep, or in a fainting-fit, seemingly!</p>
                  <p>He had not eaten or drank anything since morning. There was no way to account
                     for this mysterious unconsciousness, so far as he was concerned, and it was a
                     curious case. But, a moment afterwards, two stout coolies halted at the door of
                     the little office with a curtained palanquin, from out of which jumped a
                     native, who quickly entered the room where Hargreve lay, entirely unconscious
                     of anything in life.</p>
                  <p>"He is sick," said the stranger to the bearers of the palanquin. "Take him up
                     carefully, and bear him to the bungalow I told you of, as quickly as
                     possible."</p>
                  <p>The laborers did as they were directed, and a moment afterwards the little
                     office was empty. The door was left open, and the atmosphere in the room was
                     soon purified once more.</p>
                  <p>The faithful spy had been watching this sort of opportunity for a week. He had
                     seen Hargreve come and go from the lawyer's premises often, but cautiously,
                     during the daytime, for some days previously, and he thought he might be able
                     to secure his prey at an unguarded moment on the Englishman's part, if he were
                     watchful. He had informed the doctor of what he had seen, and it was agreed
                     between them, if the young foreigner should be trapped by either, that he
                     should not be disposed of except in the presence of both.</p>
                  <p>When Hargreve came to consciousness, therefore, as he did two hours afterwards,
                     he found himself alone in a small, low room, which he supposed to be the same
                     in which he had fallen asleep so suddenly, a while before. He roused himself
                     from his lethargy, and attempted to rise from his sitting, when he found
                     himself effectually secured to the floor! He was about to exclaim at this
                     singular and unaccountable imprisonment, when the door opened and a swarthy,
                     half-clad brute, whom he had never seen before, entered with a sickly burning
                     candle which he placed near him, without uttering a syllable.</p>
                  <p>Hargreve hailed the native, but he made no reply. The door closed, and he was
                     alone again. He saw at a glance that he was in another apartment, or another
                     house—he knew not which—and now he remembered his "faithful friend's" caution
                     about his not remaining in town after the setting of the sun! It was too late
                     for regrets and repentance, but he would not submit without a struggle for his
                     life, if that was the object of his captors. He thrust his hand into his breast
                     for his pistols—they were gone! He turned for his poignard—<emph>that</emph>
                     had been withdrawn from its secret sheath! He was entirely disarmed, and he
                     began, in reality, now to feel his peril.</p>
                  <p>A sensation of deep distrust came over the heart of the naturally brave but now
                     captive Englishman. He had been careless but for a single half hour, when he
                     thought himself as secure from molestation as if he had been safe at home in
                     England. But, in that brief time the ever ready spy who dogged him unawares,
                     had completed <emph>his</emph> part of the project of surprising him.</p>
                  <p>This man was skilled in the opiate and poison traffic of his nation, and was
                     well conversant with the modes of applying these narcotics, at the best
                     possible advantage for his own purposes. He had prepared a potion for his
                     present object, which he constantly bore about his person, during the period he
                     devoted to dogging the movements of young Hargreve, and which he was prepared
                     to make use of, at a moment's warning, whenever the appropriate opportunity was
                     afforded.</p>
                  <p>He now noticed that Hargreve tarried in the little office of the lawyer, until
                     night had fallen, and that he still lingered in waiting, evidently, for some
                     one who did not come. Approaching the low door, with noiseless tread, he drew
                     forth his powerful opiate, deposited it in a small crucible, dropped a spark of
                     fire into the preparation, placed the murderous decoction just inside the
                     casing, and closed the door, unnoticed by, and without disturbing his victim.
                     In five minutes longer, George Hargreve had breathed the quiet odor, all
                     unconsciously, and was the cunning soodra's helpless prisoner! A palanquin was
                     close at hand, into which the sleeper was noiselessly thrust, and from that
                     moment the lieutenant was a captive, at the mercy of the Hindoo spy. As they
                     proceeded along, his captor took the opportunity to search his person
                     carefully, and robbed him of all means of defence, instanter. He was borne away
                     to a retired spot, and safely secured, for the time being, while the medical
                     confederate was sent for, to whom the spy reported his good fortune, in thus
                     arresting the "Christian dog" who had so imposed upon their employer.</p>
                  <p>The readier cunning of the doctor was now about to be put to the test. The spy
                     was an ill-disposed and miserable wretch, in whose composition there remained
                     no spark of mercy—not to speak of sensibility or humanity—and the medicine-man
                     knew it. Moreover, he was to receive from the injured widow a large sum of
                     money, when he convinced her that the business for which he had been employed
                     by her had been fully accomplished. To get rid of this troublesome agent, and
                     to save the life of the lieutenant without this man's knowledge, was not an
                     easy task—while, at the same time, he should so act as to appear to carry out,
                     in full, their joint undertaking, in order to secure the ample reward promised
                     them by the widow.</p>
                  <p>But the doctor was prepared, and he directed his associate to procure a bag
                     forthwith, into which it was proposed to secure their prisoner, and at midnight
                     thus to deposit the offending Englishman in the waters of the Ganges. A stone
                     attached to the bag would finish the business with certainty, and the dog would
                     never rise again to tell the story of his wrongs. The spy was perfectly
                     satisfied with this arrangement, and hastened away to procure the death-shroud
                     that was so soon to envelope the helpless lieutenant. The moment the door
                     closed behind the spy, who had taken the precaution, first, to place a sentinel
                     at the threshold, to watch the movements of the doctor, whom he would not trust
                     alone with his prey, even! the doctor hurried to the prisoner's side, and said
                     in a whisper, in English:</p>
                  <p>"Are you not George Hargreve?"</p>
                  <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC5953-00000043"/>
                  <p>"Yes—who are you?"</p>
                  <p>"Your friend and countryman. You are in peril! Why did you not heed my advice?
                     There is not a moment to lose. You can escape, by a single counter-plot, only!
                     We are watched at this very moment. Your executioner will quickly be here. Are
                     you a swimmer?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, yes," said George.</p>
                  <p>"Good! You will find yourself in the river, within an hour—"</p>
                  <p>"What!"</p>
                  <p>"Silence! and listen to my words. At this moment, I repeat, an armed coolie
                     treads before this door, and you can only escape by following my words.
                     Protestations, threats, lamentations cannot serve you. You are far out of the
                     reach of help, and only <emph>I</emph> can save you, George Hargreve. The spy
                     who has watched your footsteps ever since you landed in Calcutta, will soon
                     return, and he is in a powerful interest, here; be advised by me, and you are
                     saved."</p>
                  <p>"What then? Quick—you are Gles—"</p>
                  <p>"'sh! Hear me, and waste no time in asking questions. I say within the next
                     hour, you will find yourself in the river. You will be secured in a sack—"</p>
                  <p>"God of heaven!" exclaimed Hargreve, what have I done to merit this abuse and
                     peril!"</p>
                  <p>"'sh! I say again. Here, take this knife—"</p>
                  <p>"And cut that rebel's heart out?"</p>
                  <p>"No, no! Be a man!"</p>
                  <p>"I will throttle him, and escape!"</p>
                  <p>"He has a score of soodras here, who would eat you down in your tracks, without
                     a scruple. Be advised by me. I know your need, in this terrible dilemma, and
                     again I tell you if you now neglect my counsel, your life isn't worth a
                     rush-light, George Hargreve!"</p>
                  <p>"Well, well, go on."</p>
                  <p>"Place the knife in your bosom. You will be sewed up in a sack, and I will see
                     that your hands are so disposed that you can use this instrument. Cut the bag
                     asunder as you fall into the water, and when you rise, make no sound."</p>
                  <p>"I shall perish!"</p>
                  <p>"No. I will have a boat within sight and hearing, which I will make
                        <emph>sure</emph> of, before you go over. We shall proceed in one direction,
                     you will be borne down in another. Your <emph>friends</emph> will rescue you,
                     and you will not be injured. If you accept this proposal, you can be saved
                     without further harm. If you resist, you will be knocked on the head, without
                     hesitation. Summon all your courage—I hear the footsteps of the returning spy.
                     Trust me—<emph>I am your friend;</emph> but I can only serve you by this
                     stratagem, for your enemies here are all too powerful to resist. I shall be
                     absent an hour, or more, to provide secretly for your preservation. Be patient,
                     and when you <emph>now</emph> escape, remember, be prudent! 'sh!"</p>
                  <p>The spy entered at this moment, and found his prisoner still safely secured to
                     the floor, while his confederate, the doctor, lay in the farthest corner
                        <emph>sound asleep!</emph> He woke him with difficulty, apparently, and the
                     two men instantly commenced to converse in a jargon entirely unintelligible to
                     their prisoner, during which, the spy informed the medicine-man that the sack
                     was ready, and urged the immediate consummation of their contemplated deed.</p>
                  <p>To any haste in the matter the doctor demurred, and proposed to wait till
                     midnight, when the affair could be finished up with more show of safety to
                     themselves; to which the spy at last reluctantly agreed, and they left their
                     prisoner to himself.</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XXIX.</head>
                  <head type="sub">GETTING THROUGH A SMALL HOLE.</head>
                  <p>As may readily be conceived, the sensations of Hargreve, about this time, were
                     anything but agreeable. He was a close prisoner, in a strange land, in a
                     strange house, surrounded by the worst of the vile Hindoo natives, who not only
                     hated an Englishman supremely, but who for hire would murder their own
                     neighbors in cold blood, without a single compunction of conscience! He felt a
                     sort of reliance upon the medical man, however; and if his dreadful scheme
                     should all work rightly, he did not fear for the result. He hoped for the best,
                     and made up his mind, at last, that he would run less risk, by accepting the
                     doctor's advice, than by attempting to cut his way out of captivity, to flee—he
                     knew not whither, amid the darkness.</p>
                  <p>The doctor soon secured the services of a waterman, confidentially, whom he
                     knew, and who, for the promise of a hundred silver rupees, agreed to follow his
                     employer's instructions. He enjoined him to be within hail of a certain spot
                     (near where it was proposed to deposit the body of the lieutenant), at half an
                     hour before midnight, and to be on the lookout, without showing himself, on the
                     water, for a man who would float towards him, immediately after midnight. He
                     was instructed to rescue him, without comment, and his reward was certain. This
                     arranged, the old man returned directly to the bungalow, where Hargreve was
                     still a prisoner.</p>
                  <p>"Have you searched him thoroughly?" inquired the doctor, when he came back,
                     addressing himself to the spy, as if in confidence.</p>
                  <p>"Yes," said the other.</p>
                  <p>"I will examine him once more, then," said the man of medicine. "If he has any
                     valuables upon his person, we shall want them for evidence, to satisfy our
                     employer that we have made no mistake in the man, and that the deed is fully
                     accomplished."</p>
                  <p>"You are right," responded the spy. "Yes, he may have some trinkets that I did
                     not see. I secured his weapons only."</p>
                  <p>The doctor was again at the prisoner's side.</p>
                  <p>"I have promised to rob you of whatever you possess of value, to satisfy the
                     villains who surround you, here," he said, in a hushed whisper, "and you must
                     not resist. I will see that all is safely returned to your hands, to-morrow,
                     for, if you follow my injunctions, all will go well. A boat awaits you, a short
                     distance from the spot where you will fall. Have no fears; the night is dark;
                     and our scheme will prove a safe one. Be guarded, hereafter—leave Calcutta at
                     your earliest chance, and thank your lucky star that you are thus fortunate,
                     again," he added, impressively.</p>
                  <p>While he thus whispered, the doctor took from<pb n="88-89"
                        xml:id="VAC5953-00000044"/> his person a few English gold coins, his watch,
                     a diamond ring from his finger, that belonged to Katrin and which the mother
                     knew, and an exquisite little miniature of his wife, which he wore next his
                     heart. With a final word of warning, and an injunction to be firm in his
                     approaching or-deal, he pressed his captive's hand, and departed. The trophies
                     he now presented to the inspection of the spy, pleased that interesting
                     individual greatly, for he saw, at once, that these relics would instantly
                     convince the widow of the faithfulness and success of her agents, in her
                     infernal plot. He little suspected what would be the real use to which this
                     evidence would eventually be turned!</p>
                  <p>A few minutes afterwards, all was in readiness, and the two men entered the
                     apartment with a large sack, into which, despite his struggles, young Hargreve
                     was quickly thrust, with his hands folded across his breast. He was hurried to
                     the river, placed in the boat, and the two agents pulled out into the stream. A
                     stone was attached to the bottom of the sack, a signal was given by the doctor,
                     Hargreve drew out his open knife, the sack went over the side of the boat, and
                     a heavy blow with the oar in the hands of the spy, intended for Hargreve's
                     skull, but which glanced aside upon his shoulder, completed their fearful
                     evening's work! A smothered shriek escaped the lips of their victim as he
                     touched the water, the sack instantly disappeared amid the darkness, and the
                     two scoundrels pulled lustily for the shore, away from the scene of their
                     diabolical infamy.</p>
                  <p>When Hargreve was put into the sack, the doctor took good care to release his
                     feet from the encumbrance that secured them together, and the moment the
                     lieutenant sunk below the surface of the dark waters, his knife was brought
                     into requisition. With a single desperate lunge he stripped an opening down the
                     sack, from top to centre, and as the heavy stone bore the empty bag to the
                     bottom of the river, the whilom captive mounted as quickly to the surface. He
                     struck out firmly, and five minutes afterwards, to his agreeable surprise, he
                     found himself unceremoniously seized, and rudely drawn in over the thwarts of a
                     heavy river shore-boat. His escape had been well-planned, and was thoroughly
                     successful.</p>
                  <p>It appeared that his timely rescuer had received minute instructions, for he
                     said not a single word, though, if he had, the lieutenant could not have
                     understood the native, but pulled down the river, hastily, until he reached the
                     side of Hargreve's ship, which lay in the stream. The boat lay alongside the
                     gangway, the lieutenant sprang up the steps, and the watch on deck were
                     suddenly startled at beholding Mr. Hargreve, who seemed to have dropped from
                     the shrouds, so silent and mysterious was his coming, at dead of night. He
                     offered no explanation, at present, but went below immediately, exchanged his
                     wet clothing, and turned in without disturbing any one, or answering a single
                     question. The boat disappeared, and daylight found young Hargreve still
                     wide-a-wake, and thinking over the events of the fearful night he had just
                     passed!</p>
                  <p>Just as seven-bells struck on board the Marathon in the morning, a shore-boat
                     reached the gangway, pulled by a stout coolie, and bearing a plainly-dressed
                     Englishman in the stern-sheets. This latter individual quickly mounted to the
                     ship's deck, and inquired for Mr. Hargreve, with whom he was soon after in
                     communication in the cabin.</p>
                  <p>"You do not recognize me?" said the stranger, mildly.</p>
                  <p>"No. Yes, yes; are you not—"</p>
                  <p>"The <emph>doctor,</emph>" replied the man, stopping him. "I have but a few
                     words to say. I knew my plan must succeed, last night, and I congratulate
                     you."</p>
                  <p>"I owe you everything!" said Hargreve, with real feeling.</p>
                  <p>"Tut-tut! No apologies, no thanks, listen now to my injunctions. I ask nothing
                     for my pains. I shall soon quit this place, never to return. A horde of
                     villains and robbers occupy this region, and life or property is scarcely safe
                     an hour in this cursed lawless den. I took from your person last night, certain
                     articles of value, which I found afterwards I was forced to place in the hands
                     of the spy who would have murdered you, but for my timely interference; and who
                     has since deposited them in the hands of his employer."</p>
                  <p>"Who is he?"</p>
                  <p>"<emph>He!</emph> It is the widow of Sedd Rajab," replied the stranger.</p>
                  <p>"Rajab's widow! For what purpose?"</p>
                  <p>"Did you not steal, that is, I mean, did you not go hence with her daughter,
                     some months since?"</p>
                  <p>"Yes, but—"</p>
                  <p>"She will never forgive you, or forget this act, so long as she has breath,
                     rely upon it! She will cause your death, if it can be indirectly accomplished,
                     at cost of half her fortune. Be guarded, then! Your ship soon sails for Canton,
                     I learn. Do not return hither; and, <emph>on your life</emph> I charge you, do
                     not leave the ship again while in this port. You are now in safety, and I leave
                     you thus. Observe my words! We shall meet no more. You owe me nothing, George
                     Hargreve—forget me, and be happy, in the future. Do not seek to know more of
                     me; it will avail you nothing, and will cost you much to follow me and mine.
                     Remember my words of warning! You are now believed by your Hindoo enemy to be
                     dead. Do not tempt fate by any future indiscretion. Return to your native land
                     while you may, and trust to the sincerity of one who knows this people, and who
                     is conversant, at this moment, with your peril. Take heed in time, and beware!
                     Adieu!"</p>
                  <p>Before Hargreve could ask any further questions, the stranger had gone. He was
                     his friend, the doctor, who had saved him.</p>

               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER XXX.</head>
                  <head type="sub">A NEW PROJECT.</head>
                  <p>HARGREVE sent ashore for his attorney, the man with whom he had been in
                     communication for several weeks, and from whose office, while he was awaiting
                     his return on the previous evening, he had been so singularly entrapped. The
                     lawyer responded and Hargreve, as soon as he came on board, proposed a new plan
                     to him. Without informing him at first of what had happened, he commenced by
                     inquiring what his final opinion was as to the probability of his securing the
                     rights of Katrin to any portion of her father's estate.</p>
                  <p>He learned from this man that he feared it was impossible to do anything,
                     whatever. The mother was obdurate in her will, and she despised the foreigners
                     so intensely that she would adhere to all the rights or wrongs, which either
                     the Hindoo or the Indo-British laws gave her, over her late husband's property;
                     and, at her decease, she would not leave a rupee's value that Katrin could ever
                     reach, so she declared, if she were obliged to turn the property into gold, and
                     throw it into the Ganges! This was an encouraging prospect, and Hargreve
                     instantly turned upon another tack, as soon as he heard this infamous
                     declaration.</p>
                  <p>"For myself, Mr. Sharpe," he said, "I ask for nothing. I am entirely beyond the
                     reach of want, and I will never accept a shilling of old Rajab's money. But
                     Katrin has an inalienable and unquestionable right to some portion of her
                     father's estate, since he is dead, and the widow does not need a tithe of the
                     fortune she so suddenly becomes possessed of. She shall disgorge, or I am no
                     Briton!"</p>
                  <p>The lawyer admired the young gentleman's prowess, but he shook his head, and
                     assured him that the lady was too wealthy, and he was pursuing a phantom.</p>
                  <p>"We shall see, then, presently," continued Hargreve. "Now, if you please, I
                     desire you to listen to a new scheme I have to propose."</p>
                  <p>The lawyer sat down again, but impatiently.</p>
                  <p>"I do not know how far her conduct has rendered her culpable," said Hargreve,
                     "in this land of robbers and murderers; but, if she were now in England, her
                     business with me could be very summarily, and to my claim, in my wife's behalf,
                     very satisfactorily settled. I now have to ask of you that you procure a
                     responsible interpreter, if necessary, and wait upon this Hindoo
                        <emph>lady,</emph> at once. Tell her that you come with legal authority to
                     compel her to yield, if she refuse to do so, but that you prefer that she place
                     in your hands quietly, and without further delay or parley—my watch, my arms,
                     my gold, my diamond ring, and the jewelled set miniature of my wife—all of
                     which <emph>her minions robbed me of</emph>—ay, sir! that's the word—robbed me
                     of, last night, after they had drugged, or stupefied me!"</p>
                  <p>"What!" exclaimed the lawyer, "are you mad?"</p>
                  <p>"I speak but the truth, sir, on my sacred honor," replied Hargreve. "Try the
                     experiment I now propose to you—but let her still think me <emph>dead,</emph>
                     as you will find she supposes is now the fact!"</p>
                  <p>"<emph>Dead?</emph> How?"</p>
                  <p>"Will you undertake the mission, sir?"</p>
                  <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC5953-00000045"/>
                  <p>"Certainly, I will. But you must explain yourself further, or how can I act
                     advisedly?"</p>
                  <p>"You know all that is necessary for you to be informed of, for the present. If
                     you fail to accomplish your purpose, with the information I have now given you,
                     in good faith, and which I conjure you to keep profoundly secret until I see
                     you again—in any event—then I will place in your possession indubitable proof
                     that I have within twelve hours, narrowly escaped death, through the malignancy
                     and agency of this ignorant and bigoted woman! Find access to her, instantly,
                     therefore—and claim the property I have spoken of, and which is now in her
                     house. Let me know the result of your interview, and I will then instruct you
                     farther."</p>
                  <p>The lawyer departed immediately, and upon reaching the shore, procured a brace
                     of British officers and an interpreter, and proceeded with them forthwith to
                     the retired bungalow of Rajab's widow.</p>
                  <p>The lady was not anticipating the honor of so early a morning call, from so
                     distinguished a trio as were suddenly announced to her, at her residence! She
                     was even congratulating herself upon the revenge she had so silently and so
                     completely accomplished, through the agency of the miserable devils she had
                     employed, and had already paid so roundly for their services. She was satisfied
                     that the English dog had been disposed of, and she never in her life had
                     relished her morning's meal with a better gusto. The uniformed officers were
                     announced, and at the same moment entered her apartment, following close upon
                     her door-servant's heels.</p>
                  <p>The interpreter instantly made known the business of the three gentlemen whom
                     he preceded, and a peremptory demand was as instantly made upon the lady for
                     certain personal property in her possession—a brief schedule of which he
                     presented to her astonished gaze, before she had had time to collect her
                     thoughts.</p>
                  <p>A sickly pallor overspread her dark and wiry features, and she evinced the
                     deepest alarm, at this extraordinary and fearful summons. The interpreter was
                     directed to say, in behalf of the lawyer, that the body of Hargreve had been
                     found in the river, and it had been stripped of these articles, which had been
                     traced to her possession, through the arrest of one of her agents; and that she
                     might save herself a world of trouble if she gave them up without discussion.
                     Such was the miserable woman's ignorance, guilt, and consternation, that the
                     missing articles were forthcoming, on the instant, and the party retired at
                     once, without explanation; the two officers never learning a word of what it
                     was all about, from the fact that they did not understand the language in which
                     this pleasant little negociation had been conducted. The interpreter's silence
                     was subsequently purchased, with a liberal fee, and before twelve o'clock at
                     noon, the lawyer was in Hargreve's state-room, on board the Marathon, with the
                     lieutenant's property safe and unharmed!</p>
                  <p>Great was Hargreve's joy at this success, and he did not fail to see at a
                     glance his present advantage over his reckless and foolish enemy, nor did he
                     neglect, a moment, to avail himself of it, either.</p>
                  <p>"Now," he exclaimed, "we have the business in our own hands. You will remember
                     all this, of course, and you may now be able, readily, to secure us our rights.
                     This woman is the wilful wicked mother of my wife, and I cannot, will not harm
                     her, personally, on any consideration whatever. Nevertheless, the circumstances
                     of the case, at this moment, favor us; and I now propose that you wait upon the
                     lady again, immediately, and in your own agreeable and persuasive manner (for I
                     am satisfied you must have a happy way with you, among the ladies), tell her
                     that she has but one child in the world, who is now far away in a foreign land;
                     and who is entitled by her birth, her position, and her relation to old Rajab,
                     to a reasonable portion of the great wealth he left at his death, and which she
                     needs to support the dignity and fair reputation of her father's house. In his
                     will, he proposed that she should be the recipient, at his death, of a round
                        <foreign xml:lang="HIN">lac</foreign> of gold rupees, provided she married
                     as he desired. He died suddenly, and could not change this proviso, which he
                     would undoubtedly have repented of, in time, for he loved his daughter far
                     better than the mother did. Tell her that if she will now provide for her
                     child, since she has connived at the destruction of her daughter's protector,
                     she can escape the punishment of the Indo-British laws she has so wantonly
                     outraged. If she refuses to favor this claim, add what you please, to my
                     suggestions, and let me see you quickly, after your interview. Your fee shall
                     be a round one."</p>
                  <p>The lawyer left the ship once more, upon his new mission, without a doubt of
                     making this a good day's work, at last! And after a little reflection and
                     preparation, he waited again at the Hindoo widow's dwelling.</p>

               <div type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAPTER XXXI.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE WIDOW AND THE ATTORNEY.</head>
                  <p>STRANGE as it may appear, and discordant as it had ever been with her habit and
                     previous character, the widow was all suavity, and was glad to see the attorney
                     once more! She even showed the lawyer at once, that she could speak a little
                     English; and, as he had gathered a smattering of the Hindoo tongue, also, she
                     advised that they should converse without the aid of an interpreter, to which
                     the attorney assented, and they were soon alone, together.</p>
                  <p>The lawyer commenced by giving the lady a trifling insight into the stringency
                     of the then existing Indo-British laws regarding conspiracies, and especially
                     in reference to any attempts at inveigling, robbing or murdering the innocent
                     subjects of his most gracious English majesty, from which hints the widow
                     obtained the general impression that the quartering of the guilty bodies of
                     such persons, burning at the stake, and such matters were more by-play, in
                     comparison to the torture that would be visited upon the perpetrators of such
                     deeds, particularly when the convicts were Hindoos, whom the newly-made laws
                     did not favor much, under any circumstances! Having brought the lady into about
                     the right frame of mind to finish up the purposes of his client, he then
                     touched upon certain facts that Hargreve had submitted to his supposition,
                     only, and which he did not omit to dilate upon, for the widow's especial
                     consideration and reflection. He said that "if a British subject, for instance,
                     should happen to be drugged and disabled, and should be taken away from his
                     business or residence, and borne to another location where he should be
                     disarmed, and there robbed of his purse, and watch, and jewelry, and should
                     then be sewed up in a vile sack and thrown into the river to be drowned, and
                     the villains who should thus abuse this British subject, should next day be
                     arrested and should acknowledge the deed, and should expose their employer—and
                        <emph>if</emph> this property, so stolen, should afterwards be found,
                     agreeably to their representation, in the hands of the person who they swear
                     was the instigator of the crime—the case would go particularly hard with that
                     unlucky individual, when put to trial, the more so, if that person chanced to
                     be wealthy."</p>
                  <p>Now, although the widow did not admit the application of a syllable of all this
                     to her own case, and though the attorney did not charge any such item to
                        <emph>her</emph> door, nevertheless this minute information, which he so
                     peculiarly demonstrated, interested her strikingly, and she was upon the point
                     of asking what she could do to serve the attorney, when he anticipated her
                     coming query, by turning from the original subject, and by inviting the Indy's
                     attention to<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC5953-00000046"/> the matter of her
                     daughter's claims upon her.</p>
                  <p>He pointed out to her that her only child was now in a far distant clime,
                     beyond the reach of the protector whom she had chosen, he admitted, in
                     opposition to her parents' wishes. Still, she was alone, without the means that
                     her mother could so easily furnish to aid her, and which that mother should now
                     hasten to supply, without an hour's delay.</p>
                  <p>By cautious degrees, he worked his proposition up to the point he desired, and
                     finally he frankly assured the excited and affrighted widow that if she were
                     disposed to relent, and would forthwith provide liberally for her child (as he
                     was now the only person who could inform against her), she should be exonerated
                     from her present peril, and her intended crime, which was punishable with
                     certain death, if exposed—should be forever silenced from that day.</p>
                  <p>The lady was all liberality! She now pitied her child's ignorance and want of
                     foresight, and she feared the destroying god of her idolatry would sooner or
                     later punish her for her apostacy do what her mother might. She could not
                     forgive her, that was impossible! She would pay into the lawyer's hands
                     twenty-five thousand gold rupees, which he should forward to her, by the
                     earliest opportunity; and for his own kindness and services, she would award to
                     him a thousand rupees, upon his receipt. As these two sums made, in the
                     aggregate, nearly fifty thousand pounds sterling—as the lawyer was pretty well
                     satisfied with <emph>his</emph> fee—and as Hargreve was still alive and well,
                     and was re-possessed of all his private property, he accepted the bribe, the
                     necessary documents were forthwith executed, and the attorney retired amply
                     satisfied within his own mind that this curious case had been managed with
                     consummate skill, and singular success!</p>
                  <p>Before sunset, he caused to be conveyed on board the Marathon, the money that
                     the Hindoo mother had so cheerfully donated to the beautiful Katrin's use; and
                     meeting Hargreve, he announced to him the details and the results of his
                     mission. George was content, when her saw the gold, but he was an Englishman.
                     And he said the amount might just as well have been doubled! However, he
                     accepted the gift and nothing more was said of his adventure, for the
                     present.</p>
                  <p>Matters were soon after arranged for the ship's departure from Calcutta.
                     Hargreve never saw the doctor again, nor did he pursue the wretched spy who had
                     so nearly caused his death. There was no way to reach this villain, without
                     compromising the widow; and this he could not do. The business which called the
                     Marathon to Calcutta having been finally despatched, she got ready at last for
                     sea, again. Hargreve invested his Bombay gold in silks and teas and indigo—upon
                     arriving in China, and what he could not place on board the Marathon, he
                     shipped in another vessel then in port, soon bound for England. As usual, his
                     purchases were well made, and he reaped, for Katrin's benefit, a large profit
                     upon this judicious and timely investment of her funds.</p>
                  <p>As he was about to quit India, for the last time, forever, he sat down and
                     penned a careful but brief epistle to Katrin's mother, in which he informed her
                     that he was fully cognisant of her late <emph>friendly</emph> designs towards
                     him, but fortunately he had escaped the fate she had intended for him, and was
                     at that writing safe, alive and well! Moreover, he assured her that he had
                     never suffered from the annoyances of a troubled conscience—and hoped
                        <emph>she</emph> would always "enjoy the same blessing." He acknowledged the
                     receipt of the gold, intended for Katrin, which had been duly paid over to him
                     in full he presumed! by the hand of his attorney, who knew some of her secrets,
                     and who would not, probably, trouble her, if she repented of her iniquity, and
                     her stupid bigotry, betimes. He assured her that Katrin was in good health,
                     that she was his honored wife, and that he, nor she, would ever harbor ill
                     feeling towards her, though they would not meet again on earth. He promised to
                     continue to love and protect old Rajab's daughter, and subscribed himself her
                     "son-in-law," George Hargreve!</p>
                  <p>This entertaining document reached the lady, and as it was written in English,
                     she sent for the lawyer to decipher it for her. She was not sorry to know that
                     she had not been privy to a murder—but the shock she had first received proved
                     too much for the old lady's nerves. She contrived to dispose of her husband's
                     property, entirely, and soon after died in the Hindoo faith, as she had lived,
                     a miserably unhappy woman!</p>

                  <head>CHAPTER XXXII.</head>
                  <head type="sub">HARGREVE'S RETURN TO HOME AND HAPPINESS.</head>
                  <p>THE unfortunate doctor, as he called himself, continued to wander about the
                     country, from one Hindoo city to another—at one time as a thug disguised in
                     various ways, at others a physician, a mendicant, or a juggler; until death at
                     last released him from a life that he had rendered miserable by his own early
                     errors. He entertained but little regard for anything in life, but he had
                     fallen upon the path of his son, most curiously, and he proved of service to
                     him, when the boy was once or twice in a critical condition, as we have seen.
                     Though George Hargreve was grateful for his timely aid, he could not regret
                     this man's absence from his association, and he never thought he had reason to
                     dwell much upon the dubious history of the eccentric and unlucky Henry Glessin,
                     whose name he scarcely ever mentioned after finally leaving Calcutta.</p>
                  <p>Hargreve had now been absent from home nearly a year. He had written to his
                     wife and friends several times, and he had not omitted to hint to Katrin that
                     he was busy in the attempt to obtain for her the rights which belonged to her.
                     He had received no replies to his letters, but his faithful wife had written
                     him before she heard from him abroad, and the burden of her favors was to
                     caution him against the machinations and the treachery that <emph>she</emph>
                     knew must surround him in her native land. But he fortunately escaped the vile
                     snares that were laid about his path, during his absence, and now he was once
                     more in sight of the home he so ardently desired to see, the Marathon having
                     made a good voyage from the East, with but trifling impediment from the
                     outset.</p>
                  <p>The final enterprise of young Hargreve resulted splendidly. The investment he
                     made originally in the Marathon proved highly profitable, and the funds
                     belonging to Katrin had been so used that a net surplus of fifty per centum was
                     realized in the end, upon her money, also. Thus in a pecuniary view, Hargreve
                     and his wife were ultimately in possession of a fortune of one hundred and
                     thirty thousand pounds, which yielded them finally, an income of over six
                     thousand sterling per annum, in addition to the estate of Riverdale, in fee,
                     which had been presented to Katrin, outright, by old Mr. Maitland, upon her
                     wedding day.</p>
                  <p>The Marathon came safely into port at last, and Hargreve hastened to embrace
                     his faithful and loving wife, from whom he had been separated for a
                     twelvemonth—and to receive the joyous congratulations of his friends at
                     home.</p>
                  <p>He explained to Katrin at once, the result of his undertaking, and informed her
                     without touching upon the risk he had run personally, at the end of his
                     mission, that her mother had been induced, through the exertions of a lawyer
                        he<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC5953-00000047"/> had employed in the business, to
                     send her five-and-twenty thousand Bombay rupees, as her share of her father's
                     fortune. This money he said he had invested for her in Canton goods, and she
                     was rejoiced to know that her mother had thus relented.</p>
                  <p>Hargreve did not deem it necessary to inform his wife of the details of the
                     means that had been employed to compel the Hindoo widow thus to relent! Nor did
                     he care to go into the particulars concerning that involuntary cold bath he had
                     experienced, and which was the precursor to the receipt of that money. Within a
                     few months after his final return to England, they learned of the death of the
                     widow—and an agent was subsequently employed by Hargreve to visit Calcutta, to
                     look after the residue of old Rajab's means; but he returned without finding
                     anything. The remainder of the property had been entirely disposed of, prior to
                     the mother's decease, and not a shilling could be reached by the daughter's
                     agent.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Hargreve, senior, had continued highly successful in trade for the previous
                     eighteen months, and he was now entirely released from the encumbrances that
                     for a long time previously weighed so heavily upon him, in his pecuniary
                     affairs. The friends for whom he had become responsible, and whose prospects
                     had for a time been so clouded as to jeopardize both his means and his credit,
                     had finally come out brightly, so as to save him harmless for his kindness; and
                     he had the pleasure of seeing his adopted son a happy father, and a gentleman
                     of wealth and leisure, before the boy had reached his twenty-fifth year.</p>
                  <p>Old Mr. Maitland continued still for many long years to enjoy himself, among
                     his extended circle of friends and visitors at Sunnyside, where his ample
                     fortune permitted him to live in princely style, and give entertainments to his
                     guests as was experienced at no other private residence in the south of
                     England. He was always happy, when surrounded by company, but never more so
                     than when he was trotting on his knee the beautiful infant boy of Katrin and
                     George Hargreve, their first-born, whom they had named John Maitland Hargreve,
                     in compliment to their excellent benefactor, George's uncle.</p>
                  <p>Riverdale proved a charming and delightful residence for the newly-wedded
                     couple. The present fortune of the late lieutenant enabling him to live in very
                     excellent style, and his fair wife soon learned to preside over that beautiful
                     establishment like an accomplished hostess of experience. After the long series
                     of trials and labors and mishaps that young Hargreve had realized in his brief
                     career, it was grateful to him that he could thus retire to the sweet retreat
                     which Mr. Maitland had so generously presented to his wife—where comfort, ease,
                     and constant happiness were vouchsafed him, in his future experience.</p>
                  <p>The lovely Katrin grew more beautiful as a mother. Far or near, she had no
                     rival in her natural queenly beauty of face and form—and none disputed her
                     claim to the "Belle of the South," as none could ever dispute her original
                     title as the "Belle of the Orient." And what was more pleasant and more
                     agreeable than all, was the fact that she did not seem to be aware of her
                     graces, and the charms she evinced in common intercourse with all who
                     surrounded, or who met her, from time to time, either among her household or
                     the society she dwelt in. Katrin proved indeed a prize to her noble husband,
                     George Hargreve.</p>
                  <p>As the years that succeeded flew away, the family of Mr. Hargreve, senior,
                     passed down the hill of time amidst the solid enjoyments that a life of honor
                     and general benevolence surely brings in its train. The good old Mr. Maitland
                     lived to a goodly age, and died at last, revered and deeply lamented by scores
                     of devoted and worthy friends—who mourned the decease of one of nature's
                     proudest noblemen—an honest, true-hearted, liberal man. He left but a single
                     heir, between whom and his subsequent <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                        >protege,</foreign> George Hargreve's son, he divided the bulk of his
                     property, in his last will and testament.</p>
                  <p>Sunnyside is still a magnificent old estate, and the children of Hargreve's
                     children now frolic beneath the cooling shadows of the great old elms and oaks
                     and chestnuts that line the broad avenues, or dot the spacious grounds of this
                     noble domain.</p>
                  <p>Hard by stands Riverdale, the country seat of a worthy heir of the family—and
                     joy is apparent in all the appurtenances and ordering of these still elegant
                     establishments, the hospitality of whose princely proprietors has come to be a
                     proverb, in merry England.</p>
                  <p>In the midst of this good fortune and happiness, dwelt Katrin, the beautiful,
                     who never regretted the choice she had made; while her husband lived to prove
                     the virtues of his wife, and to feel that, in the end, he had no cause to
                     complain of the HINDOO MERCHANT'S LEGACY!</p>

               <head>THE YOUNG MIDSHIPMAN.</head>
               <head type="sub">BY ALICE G. ELEMENDORF.</head>
               <p>THE blue sky of June was bending in full beauty over an ancient country mansion on
                  the banks of the Hudson. The beams of the afternoon sun were doing their best to
                  bring to sight all the ravages of time and use in a large apartment in which sat
                  the aged mistress of the house, and one other person. This was a small, rather
                  good-looking man, with a most deferential smile and humble address. He was
                  spreading before the lady some very frightful-looking law papers.</p>
               <p>"Excuse me, madam," he said, this is a painful business, but it is fit that you
                  comprehend it rightly. A lady, to be sure, hasn't much knowledge of the
                  technicalities of the law, but I am certain you understand enough of these
                  documents to know that they substantiate what I have been saying. Shall I read
                  them again, madam?"</p>
               <p>"No, no, Mr. Clark, it is not necessary that you set forth to me again the way in
                  which the inheritance of my children has become yours. You have got it all, now,
                  all but this old house and the garden-plot."</p>
               <p>"You speak as if I were to blame, madam. The law gave it to me. I did not take
                  it."</p>
               <p>"Well, let it pass. About this other affair, now. You say you will secure to me a
                  certain sum yearly, if I will sign a mortgage upon this house—the dwelling where
                  all my children were born."</p>
               <p>"So I have told you, madam; merely from a spirit of kindness towards yourself, not
                  from any hope of profit."</p>
               <p>Soft was the voice with which this was said, and yet the aged widow raised her
                  eyes to the countenance of her companion, and after a long and melancholy gaze,
                  shook her head and replied:</p>
               <p>"I cannot, Mr. Clark, I cannot! Memory is too strong. It brings up the time when
                  my husband lived, and all my merry boys bounded round me in this house—now so
                  lonely and time-worn."</p>
               <p>"As you please, madam, as you please," said again the mild voice of Mr. Clark, as
                  he rose and gathered up his papers. "It is for your benefit, not mine."</p>
               <p>"Will it do any good, Mr. Clark, if I once more entreat you to be merciful, and
                  spare the portion of my last remaining child?"</p>
               <p>"You distress me, my dear madam, by this constant implying that I am acting a
                  cruel part. This is a plain matter of business in which I am letting my feelings
                  have much more influence than almost any other person would, as the proposal I
                  just now made to you proves,"—and bowing low, Mr. Clark took his leave.</p>
               <p>There had been a third individual, an unobserved listener to this conversation—an
                  old negro, who had been standing in the adjoining lobby. He was one of the two
                  remaining attached and faithful dependents of the De Ruyter family—born in the
                  house and formerly owned by old Mr. de Ruyter. His hopes and feelings were
                  identified with them, and his sympathies were strongly excited by the effect
                  produced on his usually resigned mistress by the interview he had witnessed. As he
                  attended Mr. Clark to the door, he could scarcely forbear giving utterance to his
                  sentiments in language perhaps a<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC5953-00000048"/> little
                  too strong to meet the ear of that very mild and courteous gentleman. He returned
                  to his employment of polishing his young master's boots, muttering:</p>
               <p>"Feelin's! what business he to talk 'bout feeling's? He no more feelin' than this
                  yere ole brush."</p>
               <p>"Hallo, Cesar, what are you mumbling there?" cried George de Ruyter, a bright-eyed
                  boy of fifteen.</p>
               <p>"Ah, Massa George, smooth, smiling Massa Clark bin up stairs, and it means no good
                  when he comes, I can tell you dat, Massa George;" and Cesar proceeded to
                  communicate to the boy all he saw and feared in connection with the redoubtable
                  Mr. Clark.</p>
               <p>As he went on in his whispered tale, he grew more and more energetic in his
                  blacking operations, and twisted his sable features into such grotesque
                  expressions of grief, that George burst into loud fits of laughter. But soon his
                  face sobered, and he took up his fishing-rod and left the kitchen. His steps were
                  bent in the direction of the hills, and ere long, he looked down on the habitation
                  of Mr. Clark.</p>
               <p>"Any one would know that for the house of a Yankee wherever he saw it," said he to
                  himself, as he gazed on the neatly-painted frame house, with its bright, green
                  blinds. The fresh, white paint glistened in the afternoon sun, and all the fences
                  and out-buildings wore a compact, trim look, which, as George thought, showed the
                  Yankee. Everything was scrupulously neat, but there was nothing picturesque.
                  Indeed, what can be less so, than most the American cottages? prim, white things,
                  with grass-green blinds.</p>
               <p>"It is too new to look like anything," muttered George, turning away with not very
                  pleasant feelings towards Mr. Clark. "And yet," thought he, as he pursued his
                  ramble, "they say he is very kind to some people. There's that old crazy negro of
                  his that he humors in everything. He can have feelings then when it suits him. He
                  is a hard work-master though to his workpeople, and harsh to all inferiors. I
                  don't understand that. I should think he was too calculating, too polite for that.
                  He should be true to that Yankeo proverb, 'The good-will of a dog is better than
                  the ill-will of his master.'"</p>
               <p>The twilight spirit had spread his mantle over the earth as George entered his
                  mother's drawing-room. She was seated by the window in melancholy thought. She was
                  thinking of the past, of forms and faces which death, to use an expression of
                  Lamartine, had "petrified in her affections." Madame de Ruyter, as she was
                  generally called, had long been a widow. In the flush of early youth she had come
                  as a bride to the house which was now crumbling to decay around her—in that house
                  seven fair children had been born to her, and from that house six of these
                  tendrils of her heart had been called away with hushed breath and measured
                  tread.</p>
               <p>The wheel of Fortune had turned for the De Ruyter family, and most of the broad
                  lands they had held for long years had passed into strange hands. Madame Ruyter
                  bore her misfortunes with dignified resignation, but sometimes, as she looked on
                  her youngest born, her heart would struggle with her pride. The De Ruyter family
                  was one of the first and oldest in the country, and were therefore yet regarded
                  with as much consideration as formerly by the whole neighborhood, while George,
                  for his enthusiastic temper and buoyant spirits, was a general favorite with all
                  save Mr. Clark, who was the principal attorney of the village, a smooth, careful
                  man, of the strictest business habits, and too shrewd and vigilant to forfeit his
                  birthright as a New Englander. People said he had grown rich on the spoils of the
                  De Ruyter property. To him, George was never a pleasing object. It was but the
                  operation of the common law—the injurer disliked the injured.</p>
               <p>A few days after the above-mentioned interview, Mr. Clark found Cesar gathering
                  sticks in a piece of woods near the house.</p>
               <p>"What are you at, there, fellow?" he exclaimed.</p>
               <p>"Getting wood, Massa Clark."</p>
               <p>"Clear out, instantly, and if I catch you again trespassing on other people's
                  property, it wont be good for you."</p>
               <p>But the negro stood his ground.</p>
               <p>"Don't know what you mean by trespass, Massa Clark, but I got a right to pick up
                  sticks in my missus's woods."</p>
               <p>"But I tell you they are mine, now, and you have no right here."</p>
               <p>"It was no good means that made them yours, Massa Clark, and I'll get as much wood
                  here as I like."</p>
               <p>"And I say you shall not. Throw down that armful."</p>
               <p>"Dat I don't."</p>
               <p>"Do you dare say that to me?" and the thoroughly provoked lawyer dealt old Cesar a
                  blow.</p>
               <p>The negro warded off the worst of its effects, and before a moment had elapsed,
                  Mr. Clark had regained his self-command.</p>
               <p>"Go along with your wood, fellow," he said, "but never let me see your black face
                  hereabouts again. Hark ye, Cesar," he added, "you need not say anything about this
                  to your mistress. There's a piece of silver for you."</p>
               <p>"Keep your money, Massa Clark, 'twould burn my fingers. I'll tell my missus or
                  not, just as I chooses."</p>
               <p>With a muttered imprecation, Mr. Clark turned his steps toward home. Passing
                  through the village he encountered George de Ruyter. According to his usual
                  custom, he stopped and spoke to him, but George thought he discerned a covert look
                  of spite, and the air of lurking condescension which Mr. Clark had fancied
                  entirely concealed, galled the proud spirit of the boy. George reached his home
                  with feelings fully prepared to listen to the tale which Cesar poured into his
                  ears.</p>
               <p>Some days afterward, George was riding a very spirited pony, borrowed from one of
                  his play-fellows, and encountering on a narrow road a horse and light wagon
                  belonging to Mr. Clark, the pony became unmanageable, and dashing against the
                  wagon, did considerable damage to it. On hearing this, Mr. Clark called upon
                  Madame de Ruyter for the value of the wagon. Upon her remonstrating, he proposed
                  to pass the matter over for the present, and place it with the other obligations
                  to him, but this she refused, and contrived with much difficulty to raise the
                  money to meet his demand. Throughout the village there was one feeling of
                  indignation against one who could thus take the widow's portion.</p>
               <p>And so it went on. In this small and retired village, scarcely a day passed that
                  some of Mr. Clark's family did not meet either George de Ruyter or old Cesar, and
                  on these occasions numberless were the trifles that raised unpleasant feelings in
                  the mind of each party towards the other. On Sunday morning the oldfashioned
                  family carriage of Madame de Ruyter would often be proceeding towards the
                  Episcopal Church, at the same time that the trim, freshly varnished vehicle of Mr.
                  Clark swept up to the door of the Methodist meeting-house; and that worthy
                  gentleman would writhe in concealed mortification as he witnessed how much more
                  respectful and numerous were the bows that greeted Madame de Ruyter, even in her
                  rusty widow's crape, than the recognitions bestowed on him. She saw little of all.
                  She took but slight notice of what was passing around her, lived a very secluded
                  life, and heard nothing of the gossip of the village. But George, arrived at an
                  age when the mind seizes upon any opportunity for excitement, delighted in
                  arraying himself against Mr. Clark.</p>
               <p>Months flew by and George left his home and his mother for a midshipman's life.
                  Very dreary seemed the old house to her. She missed the glowing eyes and ringing
                  laugh that had been almost her sole delight. The monotony of her life was
                  sometimes varied, however, by the visits of Mr. Clark. Madame de Ruyter had long
                  ago learned well that lesson which every woman learns, to hide an aching heart
                  beneath a calm brow, but her faithful Cesar noticed that after any one of these
                  interviews, her dignified countenance wore deep furrows, and her lofty bearing a
                  trace of heavier sorrow. There was little room for any further retrenchment in her
                  expenditure, but even additional economy, if possible, was used. The old family
                  carriage and horses were sold, and if she could have found it in her heart, she
                  would have parted with one of the attached servants of years. But she could not
                  withstand their passionate and tearful pleadings. The best part of their lives had
                  been spent in her service, and now that the frost was on their brows she could not
                  send them from her.</p>
               <p>One afternoon in the latter part of March, after George had been gone more than
                  two years, Cesar, with no very good grace, ushered Mr. Clark into the parlor.
                  After the interview had been prolonged more than an hour, he happened to pass the
                  partly opened door of the room, and great was the tempest that agitated his
                  faithful breast when he glanced in. He saw what might have moved a sterner heart.
                  He saw the large and burning tears chasing each other down the check of his proud
                  mistress, heard the scarcely smothered sobs and broken accents of grief, and
                  marked the convulsive tremblings that shook her frame. And then he saw that
                  stately woman rise from her chair and fall on her knees before the cool, quiet
                  man, who sat there with a well-counterfeited expression of sympathy on his
                  features. Ay, knelt to him; for a mother's love for an only child has caused many
                  a one to stoop lower far than that. The only emotion Mr. Clark showed, was one of
                  strong embarrassment, and Cesar ground his<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC5953-00000049"
                  /> teeth in rage as he marked how ineffectual had been the humbling of his haughty
                  mistress. Dashing away to the kitchen, he declared he could not remain under the
                  same roof with Massa Clark, seized his old gun and rushed out of the house.</p>
               <p>The afternoon sun was just setting as Mr. Clark rode forth from the gate of Madame
                  de Ruyter—the shades of night had not closed around when he was found on the road
                  leading thence a murdered corpse. The person who gave the alarm descried old Cesar
                  at a distance, and immediately seized on him as the perpetrator of the deed. He
                  was instantly conveyed to the county jail by the excited crowd that soon
                  collected.</p>
               <p>The next morning's sun shone on a house of suffering. Although Madame de Ruyter
                  did not for a moment doubt old Cesar's innocence, she knew that everything was
                  against him, and she groaned in the bitterness of her spirit, as she felt the cold
                  shadow of the approaching evil.</p>
               <p>The day was appointed for Cesar's trial. Then it was that she felt in its
                  sharpness the sting of poverty. On the side of the prosecution was employed some
                  of the best talent at the bar, while she, how could she command means to provide
                  even respectable counsel for her poor faithful negro? But she sacrificed all—sold
                  the last fragment of her property, the old homestead, in order to preserve which
                  she had knelt to Mr. Clark.</p>
               <p>The day of the trial arrived. A laborer from a farm near the De Ruyter house, who
                  was in the kitchen at the time Cesar left it, swore to his violent expressions and
                  invectives against Mr. Clark then. It was found that no other person was seen near
                  when the murder was discovered, and his gun was shown, bearing marks of having
                  been recently discharged. A number of witnesses testified to his great agitation
                  when he saw the murdered man—apparently the agitation of guilt. The lawyer on the
                  defence could only plead the generally mild character, and kind, good disposition
                  of the accused, and the improbability that the perpetrator of such a crime would
                  make no attempt to secrete himself, or no resistance when seized. He endeavored to
                  give the greatest prominence to Cesar's own account of the way in which he came to
                  be so near the spot of the murder, with a freshly discharged gun in his hand.
                  Cesar declared that he was on a hill over-looking the road along which Mr. Clark
                  was riding, and saw him dismount, apparently to arrange his horse's saddle-girth,
                  and just as he mounted again, heard a short, and saw him fall. He instantly
                  hurried to the place, but the road was circuitous, and before he arrived there,
                  the alarm had been given, and he found himself seized as the murderer. His own gun
                  had been fired at a bird a half hour previous. The lawyer wound up his speech by
                  an eloquent appeal to the feelings of the jury. He spoke of the infirm widow, so
                  well known to them all, to whose load of grief this was a most heavy addition—of
                  the frank, affectionate young midshipman, whose boyish heart so loved Cesar. But
                  all was of no avail. The jury with sorrowful faces returned a verdict of guilty,
                  and the judge appointed the day for the execution of the sentence of the law.</p>
               <p>Poor Cesar up to this time preserved a good degree of composure. Confident of his
                  innocence, he fully trusted that in the end it would appear, but when he heard the
                  awful sentence, his agony and despair were terrible. Even then, however, after the
                  first paroxysm, he grieved more for his mistress than for himself.</p>
               <p>"Old nigga most done with any way," he said, "not much good any more, but my poor
                  dear missus,"—and his wild sobs would break out afresh.</p>
               <p>Madame de Ruyter wrote to her son directly after Cesar's sentence was pronounced.
                  She thought there was a chance of his being then in port, and hurriedly, wildly,
                  she wrote, entreating him to come to her. She saw Cesar every day, and most
                  touching were his eager and passionate inquiries after the arrival of his young
                  master. He seemed to have no other wish in life save this, but remained most of
                  the time sunk in a kind of stupor of grief.</p>
               <p>It was the day preceding that which was to put a period to the life of the
                  faithful old negro, when George de Ruyter sprung from the stage at his mother's
                  door. "My boy! God bless you!" was the first utterance of the mother's heart, as
                  she clasped him in her arms. A deeper joy than she had known for long years
                  sparkled in her eyes as she surveyed the tall, handsome youth, whose every look
                  and tone showed such ardent affection for herself. But the tears soon veiled those
                  beams of happiness as the remembrance of old Cesar returned to her mind. George
                  sat down and heard the whole story, and then set off to obtain the customary
                  permission to pass the last night in the cell of the prisoner. This was granted,
                  and about nine o'clock he entered old Cesar's place of confinement. The clergyman
                  was there, and the sound of his voice in prayer had just ceased as the jailer
                  unbarred the door. Cesar remained for a moment as if transfixed, and then with one
                  wild cry threw himself at George's feet, and embracing his knees, clung to him
                  like a drowning man, while convulsive sobs shook his whole frame. George threw his
                  arms around his neck, and his tears mingled with those that were pouring fast and
                  burning from the very heart of poor old Cesar. Even the jailer wept.</p>
               <p>After Cesar had regained comparative calmness, George watched an opportunity when
                  the jailer's back was towards them, and slipped a small parcel into his hands. The
                  next instant the man turned around and said:</p>
               <p>"Sir, it is my duty to search your person before I leave you with the
                  prisoner."</p>
               <p>George made no objection, and the jailer, after completing his task, expressed
                  himself satisfied. As the clergyman was taking his leave, he touched George on the
                  shoulder.</p>
               <p>"Young man," he said, drawing him aside, "I saw that proceeding just now, and I
                  fear it is my duty to make it known to the jailer."</p>
               <p>George grasped his arm with almost convulsive force:</p>
               <p>"O, sir, in the name of humanity, I implore you to be silent. Have pity upon this
                  miserable man, who is as innocent of this crime as you or I. I ask not your
                  co-operation. I only entreat you not to thwart my endeavors. As you are a man,
                  sir, grant my request."</p>
               <p>"Well, my young friend," said the clergyman, much affected, "I may be doing wrong,
                  but I will be silent."</p>
               <p>The door was locked and barred, and George was alone with old Cesar. For a time
                  both forgot their situation, and most precious to their hearts was this
                  opportunity for free converse, but soon stone walls and couch of straw recalled
                  them to their position. The jailer visited the cell once or twice before midnight,
                  and it was not until after that hour that George dared to hope for any prolonged
                  absence, or to think of the parcel he had given Cesar. Scarcely an hour after that
                  time the door opened suddenly without any previous noise, and the jailer entered
                  with a suspicious look. George, who was at the window, had scarcely time to quit
                  what he was doing and assume the attitude of a gazer on the beauty of the
                  night.</p>
               <p>"Fine starlight, young sir," said the jailer, "but aint these bars rather too
                  close for a good view?" and he slowly and cautiously passed his hand over them.
                  Suddenly he paused and grasped one of them—he shook it. A violent trembling of
                  Cesar's straw bed could be seen, and George held his breath, and one might have
                  counted the beatings of his heart. But at last the man said:</p>
               <p>"All right, I believe. When I stood outside there, I thought I heard a strange
                  noise—but I will trust you, young sir; or rather, I'll trust these bars."</p>
               <p>"Much obliged to you," retorted George. "Whatever your suspicions are, it's too
                  hard that you should disturb this poor fellow's last rest. You'll be coming to
                  wake him again, soon, I suppose?".</p>
               <p>"When I come, you'll know it," was the only response.</p>
               <p>But George was not to be surprised a second time. He met him at the door.</p>
               <p>"One more hour," he entreated, "one more hour. O, could you wake him now?"</p>
               <p>The jailer looked in at old Cesar, who was apparently sound asleep.</p>
               <p>"Well, well, poor fellow," said he, "I'll have hard work though to get everything
                  done."</p>
               <p>In one hour he returned, but what a different scene met his eye! In the middle of
                  the cell stood the young midshipman, his arms folded on his breast. Two or three
                  files and a hand-saw lay on the floor, and Cesar was not to be seen.</p>
               <p>"Help, help!" shouted the jailer, seizing George by the collar.</p>
               <p>The whole house, and indeed the whole neighborhood was soon aroused. The jailer,
                  hastily locking up George in the nearest cell, ran to get the orders of the
                  sheriff. That functionary was standing on the steps of the tavern which adjoined
                  the prison, directing the pursuit in much excitement.</p>
               <p>"Send out parties on all the roads," he cried. "Set two or three men searching the
                  premises here. There are not enough of you," he continued. "We want another horse
                  and man. Have you no more horses?" turning to the tavern-keeper.</p>
               <p>"That old crazy nigger of Mr. Clark's came here last night on horseback. We could
                  take his horse, or send him."</p>
               <p>"Let him go himself by all means. He's got sense enough for that. Go and wake
                  him."</p>
               <p>The men ran off, and very soon returned, accompanied by a negro, leading an old,
                     gray<pb n="100-101 (Advertisement) " xml:id="VAC5953-00000050"/> horse. George,
                  whose window overlooked the yard, almost screamed as he saw how much more perfect
                  than he had even imagined, was the disguise. In truth, no one who had not
                  witnessed its putting on, would have dreamed that the figure before him was not
                  the negro he was personating. The clothes and slouched hat really belonged to the
                  other, and most perfectly had he assumed his whole air and gait, though very
                  different from his own. Slowly and coolly did the convicted and condemned man lead
                  up the horse, and stand within the sheriff's grasp. George trembled with
                  impatience as he saw that all the others were sent off first; but at length the
                  sheriff turned to him:</p>
               <p>"Take the northern road, my good fellow. Throw off that immense coat, though, and
                  you can ride better."</p>
               <p>George clenched his teeth tightly, as he heard this order, but Cesar affected not
                  to hear, and busied himself with his horse's head-stall.</p>
               <p>"But how is this?" exclaimed the sheriff, as he saw the horse resist all attempts
                  to mount him. "That horse ought to know you better than that," and he looked
                  sharply at him.</p>
               <p>Again did George bite his lips till the blood came. Cesar turned, and assuming the
                  very look and tone of his prototype, replied:</p>
               <p>"O massa, de reason is, I can't manage him bery well, dis mornin'. I was waked up
                  in such a hurry."</p>
               <p>He at length mounted and returned a last look at George's window. He had not got
                  much beyond the gate of the yard, before the sheriff hallooed loudly for him to
                  come back. George groaned in despair, and frantically clutched the bars of the
                  window. Cesar quietly halted, faced about, and turned back into the yard. The
                  sheriff only wished to give him some more precise directions, and raising one more
                  speaking glance to George, he rode off again. He rode at a quick, but steady pace,
                  till he had cleared the village, then turned in his saddle, and cast one look back
                  and set off at a hard gallop.</p>
               <p>Before night all the men returned except the rider on the gray horse. The animal
                  appeared the next morning at his stable-door, and during the day Mr. Clark's old
                  negro returned from the village twelve miles distant, to which George de Ruyter
                  had contrived to send him, and said that on that memorable night he had lent his
                  clothes to the young midshipman—so that was fully explained.</p>
               <p>George remained in durance, but there was no room for sorrow in his joyful heart.
                  His daring plan had fully succeeded. He had with much difficulty and many
                  persuasions prevailed upon Sambo to lend him his clothes, and leave the village
                  immediately. In this, his stately mother had assisted. She had been near that
                  night to see that "crazy Sam's" departure was unseen by any, and that Cesar gained
                  unobserved the former's sleeping-place in a loft over the barn.</p>
               <p>No one, even the wise and sober village fathers, could find it in their hearts to
                  blame George, and many expressed their enthusiastic admiration. His confinement
                  only lasted till a petition for his full pardon, signed by more than half the
                  entire population of the county, was forwarded to the governor.</p>
               <p>Almost all in the village rejoiced that Cesar had escaped, and this feeling became
                  universal, when a few months afterward a pedler passing through the place, and
                  hearing of the occurrences, declared that he could swear to Cesar's innocence. He
                  had been on the eminence near him, and had heard the shot and seen Mr. Clark fall.
                  He would have gone to his assistance, but observed Cesar hurrying in that
                  direction, and as night was near, proceeded on his way. He had heard nothing of
                  the subsequent events, as he had gone westward immediately. His impression was,
                  that a pistol in one of Mr. Clark's own holsters had accidentally gone off as he
                  mounted his horse. As soon as this was known, two of the villagers went in search
                  of Cesar, who had made his way to Canada. After some difficulty they found him and
                  brought him back.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Clark's affairs were settled, it had been found that Madame de Ruyter
                  could become again the owner of her old home, and some few of the rich acres that
                  surrounded it. In the house in which he was born, old Cesar passed the remainder
                  of his days, and at last closed his eyes in presence of his beloved mistress and
                  young master, who was then and is still a distinguished officer in our navy.</p>
