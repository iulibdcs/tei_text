&#xD;
CHAPTER, I.&#xD;
Brilliant indeed was the asseinblage of fair women and brave aen&#xD;
that graced the drawing rooms of the Secretary of the 'Navy on a&#xD;
bright starlight evening in the month of January, 185.-. It was&#xD;
by far the most magnificentreception of the season, and had ben&#xD;
a most prominent topic of conversation for many week previous;&#xD;
consequently when the-evening came, and the glittering thrng as-&#xD;
senibled, a scene presented itself ,altogether too gorgeous to cgotn0rt&#xD;
with the plain notions of the multitude which composed what a&#xD;
often been termed the ",City of Magnificent'Distances," the Capi-&#xD;
tal of. our glorious Republic- It was seemingly the object ofteach&#xD;
lady tc surpass all others in the richness 'and elegance of attire and&#xD;
otnainent. All political differences were apparetly forgotten, love&#xD;
ly daughters of the sunny South might be. seen leaninguporti.&#xD;
arms of gallant representatives of the North, and fa haried torz.'&#xD;
em  belles wCro politely escorted through the gay as enblage-,by&#xD;
courteous and chivalric .Southerners. But, little, notice was take&#xD;
of the numerous arrivals, and none seemed to receive more than&#xD;
ordinary attention; but after the company hadheen a   time&#xD;
sembled, the announcement of "the iknorable'r.       eron&#xD;
daughter of South Carolina,'' created a sensation w&#xD;
throughout the saloon; all were anxious to behmold the lady W&#xD;
out to make her centre; for although rumor had spread fa&#xD;
wide the reputation of Miss Caweron, for beauty bot   6df mind&#xD;
person, no one present had yet seen this reputepagagon o  o&#xD;
ness; for since her airval in the city she h d imtaued her&#xD;
her private apartments at "Willard," in ordertEsh   i&#xD;

14            COL. LEONARD IN LoVE WITH ELLA.&#xD;
when roused by passion; but when lit up by love, soft and gentle at.&#xD;
a seraph's gaze: and when she turned a melting look upon you, theu&#xD;
you would ask if aught that dwelt on earth could be so lovely 1&#xD;
A single diamond of immense value glitters upon -her small and&#xD;
dimpled hand, and in her hair she wore a small white rosebud ; with&#xD;
these exceptions the tout ensemble of her attire was perfectly plain,&#xD;
for "loveliness needs not the foreign aid of ornament, but is, when&#xD;
unadorned, adorned the most."&#xD;
We have as yet said nothing of the various groups of gay and&#xD;
fashionable young gentlemen, who stood in different parts of the&#xD;
rooms, engaged in arranging their matters of etiquette -for the&#xD;
evening, and occasionally glancing with admiring eyes upon the&#xD;
blaze of feminine beauty arrayed before them.. The gentlemen, it'&#xD;
must be confessed, were far behind the ladies in the costliness of&#xD;
their apparel, but they were as richly and as showily dressed as the&#xD;
extremity of the Parisian modes would allow-&#xD;
Among the most distinguished guests present was Colonel Leonard.&#xD;
He had been acquainted with the father of Ella for a number of&#xD;
years, and although Mr. Cameron had never hinted or insinuated&#xD;
such a thing, yet it was a thought always uppermost.in his mind,&#xD;
that Colonel Leonard was precisely such an individual as upon whom&#xD;
he would gladly bestow his lovely daughter.&#xD;
Colonel Leonard had used every endeavor to ingratiate himself&#xD;
into the favor of Ella, and, if possible, to win a smile of love from&#xD;
her sweet lips; but his joyful anticipations, seemingly, were not&#xD;
'tined to be realized. The very means which he used to secure&#xD;
h   avor, only rendered her the more averse to the contemplated&#xD;
mat h; still, as he was her father's friend, she, knew not how to&#xD;
avoid his attentions.&#xD;
Standing apart in the embrazure of a window, intently gazing&#xD;
upon the beautiful form of Ella, was Walter Moreland, a young&#xD;
'.'exan of high birth but reduced fortune. The southerner was hand-&#xD;
rame and of gentlemanly appearance; he was a person whose charae-&#xD;
ter wa's fully imbued with those notions of honor peculiar to south-&#xD;
en "bloods -" he could not brook an insult without demanding&#xD;
immediate satisfaction of the offender. Once the possessor of a&#xD;
noble estate which he had squandered at the gambling table, he was&#xD;
now forced to live upon his wits. By means of letters of introduc-&#xD;
tion serruptitiously obtained to some of the most prominent and in-&#xD;
fluential men at the seat of government, he had gained admittance&#xD;
into that circle of society n which we find himat the time our story&#xD;
opens. Having received a collegiate education, and possessing&#xD;
talents of a high order, and superior conversational powers, together&#xD;
with a pleasing exterior and plausible manner, he had thus far found,&#xD;
no difficulty in supplying himself with means. sufficient to enable,&#xD;
him to indulge in all the luxury to which he had in early life been&#xD;
accustomed.&#xD;
"By heaven! she is beautiful, nay sublime !" soliloquised More-&#xD;
land as he gazed a4giinagly upon our heroine, "and come what&#xD;
may, I must and wll~ossess her. But how ? No matter, " faint&#xD;
heart ne'er won fair lady yet." My plan is not yet matured; how-.&#xD;
&#xD;
WALTER MoRELAND-CoL. LEoNAtu's RIvA.            15&#xD;
.   there's time enough for that hereafter : first let me procure an&#xD;
introduction and then trust to my own ingenuity and unblushing ef-&#xD;
frontery for the result."&#xD;
"iCaught by Jove " exclaimed a voice close to him, and turning&#xD;
he recognized in the speaker an old friend.&#xD;
"1Charly Lovell, by all that's wonderful!I the very man of all&#xD;
others I most desire to see," exclaimed Moreland, when did you ar-&#xD;
rive ? where are you from ? and 1ow long do you intend to stay ?"&#xD;
"$One question at a time, one at a time, Walter," replied Lovell.&#xD;
"I arrived this morning from Norfolk, and it depends entirely upon&#xD;
,our host how long I shall remain. I observe you gazing intently upon&#xD;
Miss Cameron ; are you acquainted with her ?"&#xD;
"Only by reputation," replied Moreland, "but as she is from your&#xD;
native state you doubtless have that honor."y&#xD;
"4'Sheis an old friend and playmate of mine and I shall be bappy&#xD;
to introduce you; come, she now seems to be disengaged."  And&#xD;
arm in arm they proceeded to where Ella was standing beside her&#xD;
father, who was busily engaged in conversation with their host and&#xD;
hostess.&#xD;
"iMiss Cameron, permit me to introduce to you my esteemed&#xD;
friend and former classmate, Mr. Walter Moreland, of Texas," said&#xD;
Lovell: and then excusing himself he left them together.&#xD;
They had been some time engaged in conversation when Moreland&#xD;
suddenly said: "Who is that distinguished looking gentleman who&#xD;
is staring so frowningly upon me ?"&#xD;
It was Leonard, who had for some time stood upon the opposite&#xD;
side of the room, viewing with disdainful looks the apparent happi4&#xD;
ness of Ella and Walter.&#xD;
She turned her eyes, and met the angry gaze of the Colone 1&#xD;
Doyou allude to. the man with the moustacehe 7" asked El'&#xD;
"The same. Who is he ?"&#xD;
"He is-that is-he is an acquaintance of our family, ad&#xD;
father's particular friend :" replied Ella hesitatingly.&#xD;
The expression of Moreland's face changed from complacency to&#xD;
doubt and apprehension. That this man was a rival seemed probable.&#xD;
"May I presume to inquire his name ?" asked he.&#xD;
The gentleman of whom they were speaking now approached Ella,&#xD;
and saluted her.&#xD;
"My thend, Colonel Leonard, Mr. Moreland " said Ella, intro-&#xD;
ducing them.'&#xD;
The gentlemen nodded coldly to each other.&#xD;
The music now began and Moreland was about to leadElla to the&#xD;
floor : but at the moment he extended his hand' he wa  rudely Crowd-,&#xD;
ed aside by Leonard, on observing the-intention of the young Texa.&#xD;
"Sir, I have a prior claim to this lady's- hand" said Leouard&#xD;
"she is engaged to me for the next dance."&#xD;
"I appeal to the.lady herself I"' replied Moreland.&#xD;
"I have assumed the responsibility of engaging myself to Mr.&#xD;
Moreland, for this and three other dances, as- my card will ,-,how, 1&#xD;
sid Ella with dignity, as she and Moreland took their places in the&#xD;
dance.&#xD;

1a             JEALOUsY-A CHALLENGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Leonard, who looked abashed at being thwarted so decisively,&#xD;
turned upon his heel and walked away, muttering curses upon the&#xD;
stranger.&#xD;
All eyes were concentrated upon the graceful couple as they&#xD;
moved through the figures of the dance; and there was not among&#xD;
that assemblage of beauty and fashion a gentleman or lady who&#xD;
attracted such marked attention as did Walter and Ella. - She seem-&#xD;
ed the personification of modesty, grace and loveliness; while his&#xD;
well proportioned and manly figure, his handsome features, intelli-&#xD;
gent expression and polished manners, denoted him a man of no&#xD;
ordinary stamp.&#xD;
It is unnecessary for us to detail the many trifling incidents which&#xD;
followed throughout the evening after the meeting of Ella and Wal-&#xD;
ter; suffice it here to remark, that the evening passed off pleasantly&#xD;
to all present, and particularly so to our hero and heroine.&#xD;
During Ella's last dance with Walter he had offered to escort her&#xD;
home.&#xD;
"I gladly accept your company," said she.&#xD;
The hours flitted speedily by, and three o'clock had arrived before&#xD;
any indication was made by the company to separate. Ella now&#xD;
expressed a desire to leave, and leaning upon the arm of Moreland,&#xD;
she was escorted to her carriage.&#xD;
Moreland had assisted Ella into the vehicle and was about getting&#xD;
in himself, when Leonard leaped forward, pushed "Mo:eland aside&#xD;
with the intention of usurping his place, but as he placed one foot&#xD;
upon the step, he was seized by the strong arm of the young Texrun,&#xD;
who, with scarcely a perceptible effort, hurled him to the sidewalk.&#xD;
E4e carriage dr6ve off, Leonard, who had regained-his feet, with&#xD;
a malignant emphasis, exclaimed: "We shall meet again !"&#xD;
CHAPTER II&#xD;
As Moreland was being shaved the next morning by his body ser-&#xD;
vant, Pomp, a note was handed to him, the contents of which were&#xD;
as follows:&#xD;
{No., 328 G. St., Washington City,&#xD;
January -, 185-.&#xD;
SIR :-Your conduct toward me, last evening, was of a character&#xD;
too gross and aggravating for me to pass lightly over; therefore, if&#xD;
you style yourself a gentleman, which your standing in society leads&#xD;
me to suppose, I doubt not you will give me a meeting as early as&#xD;
possible, thereby saving yourself the mortification of being posted&#xD;
as a poltroon and a puppy.&#xD;
I decline 'receiving any apology that can be made either written&#xD;
or verbal.&#xD;
To WALTER MORELAND, ESQ., 1     WILIAM LEONARD.&#xD;
Willard's Hotel.&#xD;

<pb  n="Illustration-17" xml:id="VAC8360-00000005"/>&#xD;
THE CUNNING AND WITTY NEbPO, POMP.&#xD;
When Moreland finished reading this, he smiled, and than wrote&#xD;
the following note to his friend Lovell:&#xD;
" DEAR C A RLEY :-Oongratulate me. I have the happiness to&#xD;
inform you that I have at length succeeded in getting myself into a&#xD;
d--I of a scrapt. Nothing lessy riy dear fellow, than an alfair&#xD;
ot honor. I am one of the principals and the phalleged party.&#xD;
Knowing that you, .a1ove all things dse, delight in sport of his na-&#xD;
ture, I appoint you my. second. Come to my room  at Willard's&#xD;
immediately, :where we can discuss'the matter fully over a battle of&#xD;
"Heidseek."          Yours, faithfully,&#xD;
"1There, Pomp," said Moreland, "take this note to Mr. Lovell's&#xD;
lodgings as speedily as your long heels can carry you,"&#xD;
"ITIl be dar, Massa, in de twinklum ob a 'possum's eye," said&#xD;
Pomp, as he bounded out of the room and hastened to Lovell's&#xD;
lodgings.&#xD;
Pomp possessed considerable shrewdness and cunning,. wliith&#xD;
caused his young master to make ,quite a pet of him. He Aogn&#xD;
oaohed the house where Lovell resided, rang the bell, inquired for&#xD;
that gentleman, and was conducted directly to his-apartment, where,&#xD;
in a large armed rocking chair, sat, or rather reclined Charley&#xD;
Lovell, with his legs placed upon two common chairs.&#xD;
" Ah, Pomp, it's you, is it?"&#xD;
Yah, I rather think it is dis chile," said Pomp, scratching hI&#xD;
Wool and laughing.&#xD;
U                     "I should like to know what in the devil you're grinning at."&#xD;
"Nuffin, Massa Lovell, I's only study ' rifmetic littlee"&#xD;
What do you mean, you young imp of darkness ?&#xD;
"Why I wur jis calkylatin, if it take free chairs for little man to&#xD;
o             set in, how many would it take- fur de Kentucky Giant?  He, he&#xD;
haw, haw, yah 1ah! whew'!"&#xD;
"0Well, well, Ponp, now that you've done laughing,. let me know&#xD;
o                   what you want."&#xD;
"2Wall, Massa Walter's goin to fight a jewell."&#xD;
"Duel, you mean.&#xD;
"WYes, saah  He told me to gib you di8 note, it'll splain ebery&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
.Lovell read the note, kicked over the, two chairs on which his leg&#xD;
rested, and exclaimed:&#xD;
"GoodI glorious! now vanish, you quint-essencef charcoal, you.!T&#xD;
"Yes, saah !. I urm'd up here like a slowed t  e bullgip., an&#xD;
I'll wanish back like a Massisppy mIud-scow.&#xD;
" Begone! instantly !" commanded Lovell, throwing a shoebrAsh&#xD;
at the negro's woollyhead, which it fortunately missed.&#xD;
" Yeu didn't quite come it dat tim4, mlassa," said Pomp, a he.&#xD;

The sub was .just rising above 'the eastern horizon, When Koe'&#xD;

-8           TuE DUEL.-LBONARD IS WOUNDED&#xD;
lonely spot, a short distance from the turnpike leading from Wash&#xD;
gton City to the village of Bladensburg.&#xD;
"It seems to me that Leonard is rather tardy, especially wha.,&#xD;
we consider that this invitation is from him," remaked Moreland,&#xD;
as he glanced toward the road.&#xD;
"The hour was to be sunrise," answered the other, "he ,will le&#xD;
here in time."&#xD;
"Itnis well; you have a full knowledge of my wishes, and to&#xD;
your judgment and action I entrust myself and my honor. I will,&#xD;
retire to yon little hillock, until you settle the preliminaries with&#xD;
his second," said Moreland; and proceeding to the spot which he&#xD;
had designated, he calmly and carelessly reclined upon the sod.&#xD;
"It is near the time, Mr. Lovell," said the second of Leonard,&#xD;
"and we had better at once settle the preliminaries."&#xD;
The two seconds now retired a short distance to measure off the&#xD;
ground.&#xD;
Meantime Colonel Leonard paced nervously to and fro, casting&#xD;
frequent glances toward him who reclined so calmly on the knoll&#xD;
beyond. At last the ground was measured and a pistol placed ig&#xD;
the hand of each of the prinipals.&#xD;
"We are ready now," said Lovell, approaching Moreland, "do&#xD;
you intend to kill him?"&#xD;
"No, but I will wing him, it will teach him a lesson and at the&#xD;
same time do him no serious injury."&#xD;
"1 Then the two foes walked steadily to the place selected, and&#xD;
sach stood on the spot marked by his' second, and Men he usual&#xD;
1quiry was made:&#xD;
Gentlemen, are you ready ?"&#xD;
"I am," was the low, firm reply of Moreland.&#xD;
"Yes -" was the-short reply of Leonard.&#xD;
Then came the .fearful words-"Fire! one, two, three !" And&#xD;
4lmost at the same instant followed the reports of the two pistols.&#xD;
Leonard's right arm fell to his side and the pistol dropped from&#xD;
his hand. The bali from Moreland's pistol had taken effect in his"&#xD;
adversary's shoulder, inflicting a severe and painful but by '=&#xD;
means dangerous wound. Moreland was untouched.&#xD;
Lovell now advanced to the second of Leonard, and said: "Is&#xD;
your friend satisfied ?"1&#xD;
"Perfectly ; and he requests me to say that he intends to remain&#xD;
at the house of a friend in this neighborhood until he recovers from&#xD;
the Wound he his received in this affair, and he hopes that you and&#xD;
Mr. Moreland will iige your utmost endeavors to keep the meeting&#xD;
from gaining publicity."&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
Weeks passed away.    Moreland had been a daily visitor'at&#xD;
" Willars"   His growing intimacy with the beautiful Ella was&#xD;
observed with jealous eyes' by her numerous admirers, and .many&#xD;
y0the rumors circulated in regard to her growing affection for&#xD;
theyoung southerner. But Ella was either too proud or too in-&#xD;
&#xD;
ELLA AT THE OPERA-MORELAND'S LOVE INCREASES.         19&#xD;
different to heed these reports, and Moreland visited her when he&#xD;
pleased, leaving the world to say what it listed.&#xD;
Seated in a private box at the opera was Ella Caigeron. Walter&#xD;
Moreland leaning against one of the pillars of the box, half in the&#xD;
light and half in the shadow, holding his lorgnette of pearl and eil,&#xD;
ver in one hand, and his hat in the -other, was not a bad object to&#xD;
contemplate.  His face was dignified and expressive, and his eyes&#xD;
consummately handsome.   His costume was inexpressibly elegant&#xD;
from head to foot and worn with that ease and grace which those&#xD;
only acquire who are always well dressed.&#xD;
Mario had just finished that celebrated Art'a which is so unequi-&#xD;
vocally charming, (the redeemi.g pot in "LI Trouvitore.") Every&#xD;
body knows the .cene in the Aria-the vacant stage, without a per-'&#xD;
sonage visible-the gloomy stone tower with its barred door and&#xD;
grated windows-the clang of the guitar accompaniment, and the&#xD;
passionate voice of the Troubador rising and falling in bre"ycaden-&#xD;
tes, with its intense love and sorrow, its despairing cry of  Addie&#xD;
Leonore !"I&#xD;
The great admiration which the music aroused in the heart 'of&#xD;
Ella overflowed at a glance from Moreland. His hand touched hers&#xD;
on the arma of the chair as he leaned over her to catch her half&#xD;
uttered words,.a magnetic thrill seemed to pass from one to the&#xD;
other, and innocently enough she pressed the tips of his fhigers with&#xD;
her own, uttering some extravagance concerning the opera.&#xD;
"It delightegou," said Moreland, and drawig a chair near her&#xD;
he resumed: .  if  were only Mario to give such pleasure, or bet-&#xD;
ter, if I were only Maurice, to live and love, suffer and sing for some&#xD;
fair Leonore, Oh! what a wretched world we live in; no0 _orea o  row&#xD;
mance, we do not love, we are etngaged instead. Why pcannot we.&#xD;
livegjn the poetical and beautiful as of old, instead of in' the a4cttial&#xD;
and commonplace ?"&#xD;
'"Are there not poetical and beautiful experiences still ?" asked&#xD;
Ella*&#xD;
"Our habits and manners conventionalize every thing Eo," re-&#xD;
plied he.&#xD;
"But loye still exists.'&#xD;
An electric flash is not brighter nor more significant than the&#xD;
glances they exchanged.&#xD;
" It does-you are indeed right," answered the yougmg man, "and&#xD;
love bea'utifies, poetizes every thing."&#xD;
.Witi this scene-perhaps with these few lag to es--began&#xD;
the re'! romance of Ella Cameron's lif.&#xD;
After the intense emotions, excited in the heth&#xD;
music anid the well turned speeches of Moreland            e.th&#xD;
turn home. In the carriage the chat became m~&#xD;
Moreland had determined, upon their arrival, sh&#xD;
portumity present itself, to declare his passion            .&#xD;
After their return home, and some time spe&#xD;
merits of the opera, Moreland arose to take his le&#xD;
said: .My delay here is already a mest unjustifiable&#xD;
though it pans me deeply, I must, to-nght, take leave of&#xD;
Ella heard him with a strange mixture of relief and dread&#xD;

20              MORELAND's DISAPPOiNTMENT.&#xD;
could she live without him ? And yet it was madness to think of&#xD;
life with him."&#xD;
"And must you go ? Well ! well !" she sighed, "ten years from&#xD;
now you will look back, and smile, as you remember how you&#xD;
dreamed you spent the winter of 185-."&#xD;
"I do not think it has been all a dream," he said, fixing his eyesu&#xD;
on her half averted face.&#xD;
You mean you think you were not the only one who dreamed. I&#xD;
confess that 1, too, have dreamed."&#xD;
Moreland's brow contracted.&#xD;
" Will you never be serious," said he half angrily, "away with&#xD;
jesting," he continued excitedly, seizing her hand, "I will know my&#xD;
fate at once. Ella, Ella, you know-you must have known, sinoo&#xD;
the first time we met, how madly, almost foolishly I have loved you.&#xD;
Answer me then- ou have had ample time to consider-is it life&#xD;
or death ?-Shall I go or stay ?    .&#xD;
Ella had buried her face in her handkerchief, but he could hear&#xD;
her agonizing sobs.&#xD;
" Ella," he said, gently, "if you love me, you have no cause to&#xD;
weep; if I am indifferent, you have still less reason."&#xD;
Still she wept-she was utterly powerless to reply to him.&#xD;
For a moment pride and love seemed to contend for the mastery.&#xD;
At length the former gained the ascendency, bpt still she was silent.&#xD;
" Ella," he %aid,. "answer me, or am I to construe your silence&#xD;
into consent ? Look up, I know that you love me, we are akin in&#xD;
every thought and feeling, my soul claimed you from our first meet.&#xD;
in,  Ella, my bride, m  darling."&#xD;
Instinctively she shrank from his proffered embrace, and drawing&#xD;
herself up proudly she said, "Mr. Moreland, this declaration is to.&#xD;
tally unexpected, I surely have given you no encouragement to peak&#xD;
_kkus; although I esteem you highly as a friend,  can never be&#xD;
aught else to you, and as you value my friendship,. never again re-&#xD;
vert to this subject.&#xD;
He stood erect before her, his fine face clouded with anger and&#xD;
mnortifleation.&#xD;
"This, then, is your final answer," he said coldly.&#xD;
"It is; forgive me if I have caused you pain. Believe me, it&#xD;
has grieved me deeply to be obliged to speak thus," she said, laying&#xD;
her hand upon his arm, "-you must -forget this interview and not let&#xD;
it destroy:yOUr peace."  Moreland's lip curled.)&#xD;
"Destroy my peace? No! Miss Cameron; -you need not trouble&#xD;
ourself        grieving me, fair lady," he said scornfull y, "the&#xD;
i    s      from my eyes, that is all. I fancied you little less&#xD;

ELLA'S INTERVIEW WITH HER FATRE.            21&#xD;
He turned away with a haughty bow. She saw he was angry,&#xD;
&amp;amp;appointed, and deeply mortified, and tears sprang to her eyes.&#xD;
Let us not part in anger," she said, "we may still be friende'&#xD;
le turned and stood gazing coldly upon her.&#xD;
I am not angry, only a little disappointed. You have a perfect&#xD;
right to scorn my love if it so please you. I regret that I ha e&#xD;
troubled you so long.  I have the honor to bid you good evening."&#xD;
And with these last bitter words he left the room.&#xD;
All Ella's fortitude then gave way, and sinking on a seat shehid&#xD;
her face in her hands, and wept the bitterest tears she had ever shed.&#xD;
"He is gone and in anger, believing that I love him not. Ohl if&#xD;
he but knew all, how fondly, devotedly I have loved-him since the&#xD;
night we first met, he would not leave me thus ;" and throwing her-&#xD;
self upon the sofa, her bosom heaved with convulsive sobs. As thus&#xD;
she lay unconscious of aught save her own wretchedness, a knock was&#xD;
heard at the door. Arising, she wiped the tears from her face, and&#xD;
bade the applicant for-admission to enter.&#xD;
My daughter," said Mr. Cameron, (for it was he), "why do I&#xD;
find you in tears, what has grieved you ."&#xD;
Father ! Father! !" she cried, "I have obeyed your commands.&#xD;
I have this night told Walter Moreland that I can never be his, that&#xD;
I loved him not, and he is gone never to return."&#xD;
"You should not let this grieve you so," replied her father, "re-&#xD;
member that Moreland, though a man of polished manners, and for&#xD;
aught I know to the contrary, of unexceptionable character, is&#xD;
nevertheless a mere adventurer, without name or fortune, and as&#xD;
such is not worthy of my daughter. You will soon forget this fool-&#xD;
ish passion and its object."&#xD;
"Forget him ! Forget Walter Moreland!! No, my father, I can.&#xD;
not forget him. Is it not enough that I have made him and myself&#xD;
miserable by what I have done to-night, but you must ask me to&#xD;
forget him  I cannot, I will not. Oh! my heart, is breaking."&#xD;
She threw herself into her father's arms, where, overcome by grief.&#xD;
she gave vent to her emotions in a flood of tears.&#xD;
CHAPTER&#xD;
In one of the magnificent gambling saloons which abound in the&#xD;
political metropolis, were assembled twenty or thirty persons of&#xD;
different stations in life  Grave senators were seen in conversation&#xD;
with the well- dressed roue and gambler, and therewas nothing by&#xD;
which a stranger, entering those elegantly furnished rooms, could&#xD;
distinguish the talented statesman from the accomplished sharper.&#xD;
Thissaloon far surpassed all others iii the city, boh in elegance&#xD;
of furniture. and the class of its patrons; and its proprietors having&#xD;
gained a reputation of possessing a larger capital, and bin  ble&#xD;
to sustain greater losses than others, it was visited bytdseroly&#xD;
who were able and willing to hazard large amounts. Fwthere.&#xD;
fore, had the entre of this elegant and capatious saloon butmeng-&#xD;
bers of congress, foreign ministers and their attaches, and wealthy:&#xD;
pagers, who might be sojourning in the city, transacting business,&#xD;

22        MORELAND ENTEhw THE GAMBLING SALOON.&#xD;
with the Government, or in pursuit of pleasure; in fact no ,citie&#xD;
or clerk was ever admitted.&#xD;
Young Moreland, when he left Ella, entered a carriage at the&#xD;
door of the hotel.&#xD;
"1Wha shall I dribe you to, Massa Moreland ?" asked coachee.&#xD;
"4To Prindle's; and look, you, Sam, drive as if the d--l were&#xD;
after you;" said Moreland, excitedly.&#xD;
"Wonder what's matter wid Massa Moreland dis ebenia, he seems&#xD;
kinder 'cited; I 'specks dat purty gal he was sparkin' been gone&#xD;
and done, and said somfin to rile him," said Sambo, mountingthe&#xD;
box; "dribe as if de debil was arter me ; I calklates his fernal&#xD;
majistum wi~1 hab to git up and git to cotch dis heah team, yah!&#xD;
yah!!"&#xD;
"Unfortunate at love, fortunate at play," said Moreland, as he&#xD;
threw himself back in the carriage; "I shall test the truth of this&#xD;
time honored saying. "I've lost, to-night, where hearts were trumps,&#xD;
and at another game should win."&#xD;
When the carriage stopped at the saloon of which we have spoken&#xD;
above, Moreland leaped out and entered the street door which al-&#xD;
way stood open.&#xD;
"Golly gosh, I guess if Massa Moreland hab any luck to-night&#xD;
dem gamblums won't hab money 'nuff to pay for a 'cocktail' in de&#xD;
mornin'. I tell you when he does gamblum he puts his money down&#xD;
in big chunks;" soliloquised Sambo as he drove off.&#xD;
Let us follow Moreland and enter with him the rooms where ('dem&#xD;
gamblums', as Sambo called them), were entertaining the numerous&#xD;
guests.&#xD;
After entering from the street, he proceeded up stairs, where a&#xD;
heavy door impeded his farther progress; pulling the bell rope,&#xD;
which hung near the door, his summons was answered by an an-&#xD;
tiquated specimen of the Virginia negro, familiarly known to the&#xD;
frequenters of Prindle, Wilkinson &amp;amp; Co's establishment, as "-Uncle&#xD;
Charley," who, after ascertaining that the applicant was entitled to&#xD;
admission, pushed back the heavy bolt, and allowed our hero to pass in.&#xD;
"Good evening, Mr. Moreland," said the General, (the name oz&#xD;
title by which Wilkinson, one of the proprietors, was familiarly&#xD;
known,) "you appear excited; has any thin  unusual occurred?&#xD;
"No !-That is-nothing of importance, -I have just been&#xD;
defeated in a game at which I thought I had no superior. But let&#xD;
it pass, another time I shall be more successful;" replied Moreland,&#xD;
significantly, as he proceeded into the front room and engaged in&#xD;
plav.&#xD;
the rooms, into which we havo introduced our reader, well de-&#xD;
served the reputation for elegance they had gained. Entering from&#xD;
the dimly lighted hall, a scene presents-itself almost blinding in its&#xD;
dazzling brilliancy. The floors are covered with carpets of the&#xD;
finest texture and most costly patterns, and so soft and pliable 4hat&#xD;
no sound reverberates as the guests pass to and fro ; on the #alls&#xD;
hang numerous paintings, executed by the most renowned artists&#xD;
both ancient and modern. To the right hand, as you enter, stands&#xD;
alsdeboard of rosewood inlaid witk pearl, in the centre of which it&#xD;

an immense punch bowl of solid silver, ornamented with finely exe-&#xD;
cuted frost work; around this are placed a dozen or more goblets&#xD;
Df the same material, and similarly ornamented ; near these stand&#xD;
several cut glass decanters, containing the best of imported and do-&#xD;
mestic wines and liquors; also 'stands filledith the best brands of&#xD;
cigars. Thecontents of this costly piece of furniture are for the&#xD;
use of the patrons of the saloon free of charge. Pendant from&#xD;
the centre of the frescoed.ceiling of each room is a fnely wrought&#xD;
chandelier, from whikh eminates a blaze, of light which rivals the&#xD;
noon-day sun in its brilliancy. In the front room,against the wall,&#xD;
behind the "'dealer," hangs a large gilt frame, containing the repre.&#xD;
sentation of an immense Bengal tiger, executed in worsted work by&#xD;
the daughter of the " General."  Around the table in front of the&#xD;
" dealer" are numerous "betters," some of whose countenances be-&#xD;
tray, to the most casual obseiver, the emotions which-agitate them&#xD;
when the fickle Goddess smiles or frowns upon their ventures. Not&#xD;
one of these tell tale faces has our hero ; there he' stands, unmoved&#xD;
by the effects bf a large loss, or large gain, although his all is some-&#xD;
times staked upon the fall of a single card ; if he feels emotion his&#xD;
features do not betray him,, as "turn" after "turn" decides for or&#xD;
against him for thousands of dollars.  Fortune seems to have cho-&#xD;
sen him from out the many as, one deserving -of her favors; thei&#xD;
" Bank" has lost a large amount, and he seems to be the only per.&#xD;
son who has won any considerable sum.&#xD;
" Had we not better close ?" said the General, who was consider-&#xD;
Ably alarmed, "Moreland seems desperate to-night, and if his luck&#xD;
continues he will ruin us.&#xD;
"No, we're only loosers to the amount of some ten or twelve&#xD;
thousand, and we can stand five times that amount without feeling&#xD;
it," replied Prince Prindle to whom 'the "General" had spoken;j&#xD;
"I know," he continued, "Moreland alwas plays high, and to-night&#xD;
seems to play more desperately than usual, -and even if he should&#xD;
ruin us, as you say, "General," I know of no one who I would so&#xD;
willingly see have my money, for he is a "trump," and plays his&#xD;
money like a sport."&#xD;
" Mr. Moreland, you have more on the "five" than we like to&#xD;
turn for," said the "dealer," as Walter placed about twelve thou&#xD;
sand dollars in "checks"" upon that card.&#xD;
" Well, sir, if you are afraid to turn for that amount, I will takes&#xD;
it down;"said Moreland with a perceptible sneer.&#xD;
"I am not afraid, but we are not accustomed to allow gentlemen&#xD;
to bet such large amounts"&#xD;
" I suppose half of it will not be too much ? replied Walter, se&#xD;
he took don one 'stack of checks,' 'and placed them" oppered on&#xD;
the Jack,' placing a stnall round' piece  f bone called 'a copper&#xD;
on his money, thus indicating that he bet the 'Jack' would loce,&#xD;
Moreland said, addressing the 'dealer:&#xD;
"You have no objection to turn for it now, Mr. Singleton ?"&#xD;

ELLA'S LETTER TO MoRELAND.                  25&#xD;
It was near the middle of the deal when this conversation took&#xD;
plsce, and when the dealer proceeded to draw the cards slowly from&#xD;
the box, those who were present exhibited signs of intense excite-&#xD;
ment. Our hero and the dealer appeared as calm as though they had&#xD;
nothing at stake, and yet they were the two persons present most in&#xD;
terested.&#xD;
It is now down to the last turn," said a gentleman who was keep-&#xD;
lng the 'cises.'&#xD;
The excitement now increased, for the bets must, ,one or both, be&#xD;
decided upon this the lasiturn.The dealer hesitated, perhaps hop.&#xD;
i urpheromight take part of his money down; but no, there he&#xD;
od as composed as an uninterested spectator.&#xD;
" IWhy do you hesitate VI said he.&#xD;
The dealer drew the cards from the box with a mere jerk, and an.&#xD;
Punced the result:&#xD;
" Jack, '.five,' and seven in 'hock.'&#xD;
Moreland had won both his ventures, and the deal was endad.&#xD;
"Curse the luck," muttered the "General" between hi.3 tneth as&#xD;
the dealer paid over to Moreland twenty-four.$1000 bills, with wnhick&#xD;
thrusting the same into his pocket, Moreland left the room.&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
(    At a late hour on the morning following the incidents related in&#xD;
be preceding chapter, Ella Cameron arose. Her colorless ihps and&#xD;
inflamed eyelids, and her cheeks upon which still remainedhe traces&#xD;
of many bitter tears, were all evidences of the conflicting emotions&#xD;
which had kept her in a; fever of excitement during the restless and al-&#xD;
most sleepless night just passed.&#xD;
"Another such a night I could not survive.  Hence, false pride,&#xD;
tbou*destroyer'of my happiness, and blighter of my fondly cherishoh&#xD;
hopes, tio longer shalt thou usurp the throne: henceforth lo ralone&#xD;
shall reign in the heart of Ella Cameron.  Thus spoke our heroine&#xD;
as she procured materials and seated herself at her writing desk.&#xD;
"He shall know all, and if he will pardon my conduct last night, I&#xD;
-ay yetbe happy, loving, and beloved ;" ske continued as she pro.&#xD;
teeded to indite the following letter:&#xD;
"MY 'DEAREST WATER,&#xD;
I am anxious to ee you once again, to&#xD;
explain my conduct last evening, and to ask forgiveness for th? pain I&#xD;
unwillingly caused you.&#xD;
My father, alarmed by themany rumors concerning otir in.&#xD;
creasing affection and growing intimacy, and suspecting that theso&#xD;
rumors were not altogether without foundation, in fact yesterday&#xD;
morning solicited-a private interview with me. Having by every ar'-&#xD;
gument that could be brought to bear upon the subject, .nvain&#xD;
,ndeavoured; to convince me that yon were not worthy of my love;&#xD;
he then resorted to threats, declaring that, should I persist in re-&#xD;
fusing to discourage your attentions, he would discard, disown, d6-&#xD;
iherit. anA never see me more. Findinr that I would ueithor be&#xD;
&#xD;
26       MR. CAMERON IN POSSESSION OF THE LETTER.&#xD;
convinced by argument, or intimidated by threats, he finally ap-&#xD;
pealed to my gratitude and filial affection. My feelings being thus&#xD;
wrought upon, and being overcome by emotion, is it strange that,&#xD;
under these, circumstances, I should forget my love for you, and&#xD;
think only of the obedience I owed my only surviving parent?&#xD;
Having promised that in the event of your declaring your affection,&#xD;
I would tell you thatit was not returned, and that I could never be&#xD;
yours, I could but redeem my word though it cost us both much pain.&#xD;
After a night of anxiety and reflection I am convinced I did wrong,&#xD;
and am desirous of seeing you that I may know from your own lips&#xD;
that all is forgiven.&#xD;
Come to me immediately upon receipt of this, for until I see you&#xD;
once more I shall know no peace of mind. ELLA.&#xD;
That the delivery of this note might meet with as little delay as&#xD;
possible she summoned a servant and directed him to hand it to the&#xD;
derk of the hotel, to be placed in Walter Moreland's box. When&#xD;
the servant laid it upon the desk the clerk's attention was attracted&#xD;
in another direction, and Mr. Cameron, who was standing near, oh-&#xD;
serving that the superscription was in the handwriting of his daughter,&#xD;
immediate   took up the note, and putting it- in his pocket, retired&#xD;
to his room. When Mr. Cameron entered his room he first fastened&#xD;
the door, and then opened the letter, (the seal of which was not yet&#xD;
perfectly dry); having acquainted himself with' its contents,~he&#xD;
carefully resealed it, and placing it in another envelope, he directed&#xD;
it in a disguised handwriting to Ella through the Post Office.&#xD;
'tshe is uniacquainted with Moreland's handwriting, and will&#xD;
think he has returned her note unopened," said he, "this will arouse&#xD;
her pride," he continued, "by working upon which I cin induce her&#xD;
to marry with whomsoever I think proper,"  He then walkedto&#xD;
rhe Post Office, and with his own hands mailed the letter, thug ,i.&#xD;
Suring its delivery to its Proper address.&#xD;
While Ella was writing the letter which we have given above,&#xD;
Moreland was seated in his room at the same hotel. Upon a; table&#xD;
in front of him was the money he had won the previous- nights&#xD;
"Nearly twenty five thousand dollars,! Welf, Walter lMorelsnd,&#xD;
you are in luck. - I ha-ic beard it naid that in New York City mony&#xD;
will purchase anything, and that there are men to be found there&#xD;
who -will not hesitate to undertake any "job," provided they are&#xD;
well paid for their time and trouble. I know not if this be true;&#xD;
at all events I shall try it. I have a plan 'which, if successful, will&#xD;
accomplish my purpose and at the same time remove all evidence&#xD;
which may implicate me-in the &amp;amp;Fair. Never yet did a man or&#xD;
woman scorn Walter Moreland but they did live to r-ue it-; so my&#xD;
proud beauty, you and your vast vwealth shall both be nine yet."&#xD;
Thua soliloqnised Moreland as he gathered up hin money.&#xD;
" Did you ring, sir ?" said a servant, who answered the bell which&#xD;
Morehknd had rung a moment before.&#xD;
,"Ye ; tell the clerk to send up my bill, as I start for New York&#xD;
in the ening' train."&#xD;
Though Ella was dressed and ready to come down to dinner, she&#xD;

felt so ill and depressed that she lay dowr again, toi  her maid&#xD;
to close the shutters and leave her to herself.&#xD;
"What's this, Ella? What's the 'matter, my daughter  sad Mr&#xD;
Cam ron, entering and taking a seat at her bedside, "your 'Lnd is&#xD;
feverish." .&#xD;
"vI slept badly-scarcely at all," said she faintly, "and my head&#xD;
"Ip&#xD;
feels as if it would split with pain."&#xD;
"Poor child !" said he, as he kissed her burning forehead. "But,"&#xD;
continued he, "I came to speak to you of a matter of the utmost&#xD;
importance, and which will not admit of delay; Col. Leonard, who&#xD;
has been appointed Minister to the Court of Madrid, this morning&#xD;
made to me a formal proposal for your hand. What answer shall&#xD;
I give him? Shall I say to him that we accept his offer ?"&#xD;
"But, father-"&#xD;
"Think well before you reply. When you are the wife of the,&#xD;
Colonel you will have a station in society, so accredited, that every&#xD;
word you speak, every act you do, goes forth with its own authority."&#xD;
"I respect Col. Leonard highly, but I do not love him," she re-&#xD;
lied, "and I would a thousand times rather bestow my hand upon&#xD;
m who already has my heart, be his station ever so lowly and his&#xD;
fortune but small,,than wed the proudest millionaire in the land&#xD;
whom I did not love. I would not make trafic of my affections nor&#xD;
buy success by that which makes it valueless."&#xD;
"1These are the wild romances of girlish fancy," said Mr. Cam-&#xD;
eron ; before a twelvemonth was over you would be unable to say&#xD;
whether you had married for love or interest, except that poverty&#xD;
might remind you of the one, and affluence suggest the other."&#xD;
"But, if I am not able to bring myself to this ?"&#xD;
"Do you feel, Ella, as if you co-ld, by marrying that nameless&#xD;
young Texan, Moreland, repay my long IfN, sacrifice and struggle&#xD;
by what would undo them all ?"&#xD;
"Oh! do not tempt me this way," cried she bitterly.&#xD;
"But I will-I will leave no argument unused that will induce&#xD;
you to save yourself from inisery, and me from disgrace.  ll me,&#xD;
e continued after a pause, "will you follow my advice ?"&#xD;
I cannot reply to you now. Leave me, I will reflect upon whMt&#xD;
you have said, I need rest, and will send for you when I have de-&#xD;
cided what course to pursue."&#xD;
Mr. Cameron threw his arm around her, and pressing her to hinm&#xD;
said: "Very well, my child, lie still and get some sleop."  Ar4&#xD;
with this he turned away and left her.&#xD;
Some hours later Ella's maaid entered with a letter, which she re-&#xD;
ceived with emotion, and dismissing the servant that sahe might&#xD;
peruse its contents in privacy-for she doubted rot it was from&#xD;
Walter in reply to her note of that morning. Hastily tearig opeR&#xD;
the envelope, she found her own letter enclosed. She staggered&#xD;
back as if suddenly stricken by an unseen hand-her face changed&#xD;
to the ghastly hue of death-the light dying out in her eys; her&#xD;
very life seemed passing away from the blue, quivoring ,from&#xD;
which no gound came; a thousand ages of suffering seeme concen-&#xD;
trated ini that one single moment of intense anguish.&#xD;

claimed, and clasping her hands over her face, she wept. "These,"&#xD;
she continued, "are the last tears I shall ever shed. Now, my&#xD;
father, do with me as you will; I have neither the power or the&#xD;
de3ire to resist. I will marry Col. Leonard, and leave the scene of&#xD;
my love, my disappointment and despair, and mayI in some foreign&#xD;
land find an early grave."&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
But few cities in the world can vie with New York in the number&#xD;
of its low and infamous dens-in its dark and dangerous corners,&#xD;
where burglars, pickpockets, murderers and thieves most do congre-&#xD;
gate.&#xD;
In one. of the many smoky kennels of th "Points," a dark and&#xD;
dreary tap room, redolent of the smell of b- gin and worse to.&#xD;
bacco, and lighted miserably-some half dozen  ugh lookirig per-&#xD;
sons were seated by a greasy table in front of the b  laying cards.&#xD;
Long pipes were in their mouths and glasses- before   which&#xD;
were filled, when emptied, from a black bottle which stood near at&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
."I'm three times, Cap'n, low, jack, and the game !" said a one.,&#xD;
eyed, red-haired giant, whose face locked as if it had been traveled&#xD;
over by rough shod horses, it was so full of cuts and slashes.&#xD;
The man he addressed as Captain, looked a trifle 'more decent&#xD;
than the rest, so far as dress was concerned, but yet he was a ruffian&#xD;
as well as the rest. That could be plainly seen.&#xD;
"So you are ! that puts you out, and I'm stuck for the lush I"&#xD;
cried the Captain.&#xD;
Another "hand" was being dealt out, when a noise of approach-&#xD;
ing footsteps caused every one to raise their eyes in the direction&#xD;
of the door.&#xD;
Two persons entered. One of them had the rough, hang-dog&#xD;
look, which generally betokens the low villain-the face of the other&#xD;
was partially concealed by a slouched hat, and his figure muffled in&#xD;
a rough overcoat. But the glitter of a jewelled breastpin and gold&#xD;
chain, as well as a finger-ring, told that, disguised though he was,&#xD;
it was not likely that he belonged to the gang who made the&#xD;
"boozing ken," (or drinking place) their headquarters.&#xD;
"Who've you got with you, Jack!" asked the one known as&#xD;
Captain.   Arn't you breakin' the rules ?"&#xD;
"Not without reason, Cap'n! This here cove wanted to see you,&#xD;
and tipped the blunt, so I brought him !"&#xD;
"Who is he? A spy of the coppers ?"&#xD;
"No. But show your figure head, sir, and do your own pattering "&#xD;
TPhe stranger took off his hat and threw open his coat, revealing&#xD;
the face and form of Walter Moreland. Though fierce eyes were&#xD;
glaring upon him, and he was surrounded by rough men, who were,&#xD;
as he well knew, -so steeped in crime that to commit 'one was a&#xD;
pleasure-to avoid one a difficulty, he was perfectly calm and&#xD;
collected,&#xD;

MORELAND AMONG MURDEREiS, PICKPOCKETS, &amp;amp;o.       29&#xD;
"What do you want with Captain Harrell?" asked the Captain.&#xD;
"Your services in a matter of importance !" said Moreland after&#xD;
he had measured the Captain's calibre with a single searching glance.&#xD;
"You know who I am?"&#xD;
"Yes, the terror of-"&#xD;
"Enough, sir 1" said the Captain roughly. "If you know, that&#xD;
is sufficient, without telling of it."&#xD;
"Have you plenty of 'blunt' to pay me for my work? I don't&#xD;
do jobs for nothing," he continued.&#xD;
"I have plenty of it. There's a specimen !" and-Moreland tosed&#xD;
a purse of gold down within reach of the Captain, who took it up,&#xD;
weighed it with an air that showed considerable practice in such&#xD;
matters, and then put it in his pocket.&#xD;
"That's talking to the pint. Sit down and have a glass of lush&#xD;
and let's know what's wanted-whose wizzen is to be cut, or what&#xD;
rib cracked."&#xD;
"These people here ?" said Moreland, looking around the room.&#xD;
"They all belong to me. You needn't be afeard of them. Look&#xD;
out there, youngster, let the gentleinan's wiper alone, or I'll maul&#xD;
your cocoa-nut for you."&#xD;
This last remark was addressed to a ragged little urchin not over&#xD;
twelve years old, who had very dexterously removed Moreland's&#xD;
handkerchief from his pocket, and as in obedience to the Captain's&#xD;
order, he handed it back to the owner, sniveled out: "I only done&#xD;
it to keep my hand in."&#xD;
"Well, there's no harm done, younker, so you needn't get briuy&#xD;
about it, but keep your hands out of the pockets of our finds.&#xD;
And pickin' pockets is a low business for a cracksman. You ought&#xD;
to be above it if you are but a kid. Your dad would have walloped&#xD;
you if he'd caught you doin' such a small business."&#xD;
"Dad's lagged, and gone up, and can't wallop me any more,&#xD;
said the young hopeful.&#xD;
"As the twig is bent so is the tree inclined," said Moreland.&#xD;
"Bring up a child in the way be should go, and when he gets old&#xD;
hew-"&#xD;
"He'll do just as he d---d pleases," interrupted the young&#xD;
scapegrace.&#xD;
"If you'd rather make your business known to me alone, there's&#xD;
an inner room in the house where we can be private," said the Cap-&#xD;
tain.&#xD;
"I should prefer it ; and,.in the meantime, I wish to send for&#xD;
my servant who is waiting outside. You need have no fear of him,"&#xD;
continued Moreland, as larrell hesitated, "he is a negro, and I&#xD;
defy any one to make him speak if I bid him hold his peace.&#xD;
"4Well, let him come in if you wish it," said tho Captain. 4 ere,&#xD;
'younker, here's my pipe for you to finish, go out in the street and&#xD;
bring in the gentleman's servant."&#xD;
" 'egot one of my own, old on'," replied the precious youth,&#xD;
as he went out in obedience to Harrell's commands.&#xD;
" He's a game on', if he is little ;" said the burglar chief, as he&#xD;
'led the way into the inner room of which he had spoken. " He'li&#xD;

get too fond of lush, he'll be an invaluable-he will."&#xD;
" I should think he was in a fairy for distinction in his line"&#xD;
said Moreland as he followed Harrell in.&#xD;
The room into whiehMoreland was introduced was far better fur-&#xD;
.   nished, and had more the appearance of a poor lawyers officethan&#xD;
any thing else; for various law books were.scattered about iatuere&#xD;
was a desk, with writing materials in abundance; and quite a variety&#xD;
of old clothes hung here and there.&#xD;
"1Now you can makeoknown your business without fear of inter-&#xD;
ruption," said the Captain motioning Morelanid tossat, and taking&#xD;
one himself.&#xD;
want you to place some of' the most daring members of ydur&#xD;
band under my control for 'a short time. I have a jlr to work&#xD;
which requires strong hands and a clear head, the nature of which&#xD;
I must decline making known. If you, are 'willing to 'f li n&#xD;
with the men Ishall choose from your band, you shall be weilpaid."&#xD;
"But,"&#xD;
"Don't interrupt me. Such information as it will be necessary&#xD;
for you to have, I will give you.now without ybrr asking anyques-&#xD;
,tions, and I shall require you to promisethat you will notattempt&#xD;
to gain other information touching me or my business, than I shal'&#xD;

i"Yes. When will you be ready to eioose yoar men ?"&#xD;
To-morrow night let your band be here.assembl  at an early&#xD;
hour,- and I will then choose such as I may require for the-conan.&#xD;
plated work."&#xD;
All shall be ready for you "by nine o'clock, and let me ask you&#xD;
o e punctual, as those whom you won't want will have other job&#xD;
"I shall not keep you waiting," said Moreland, rising prepara-&#xD;
tory to leaving.&#xD;
"And let me," continued he, "give youfair warningthat if you&#xD;
or-any of your band attempt to follow mieto-night r at any future&#xD;
time, to play the spy upon my action, it will be the worse for'h&#xD;
who undertakes it*,, I do not utter this as a threat butnerelyt&#xD;

the.first of yoipr profession with whom Ihave had dealings, and I&#xD;

cThus saying he followed Hairell into the front room, and thence,&#xD;
followed by his servant, Pomp, hewent out into the street.&#xD;
Walter oreland, with his back turned upon the "Points," and&#xD;
,' ci           his face set towards his hotel, fell into a train of deep thought.&#xD;
While the master walked on, the man, whose gift was not silence,&#xD;
~~: followed with an ill-used look. For every time that honest Pomp&#xD;
had ventured to offer an observation, he had been put down by a&#xD;
- surly " Hold your tongue, sir !" from his master.&#xD;

Pomp was growing desperate, when at last he burst out with this&#xD;
wailing cry: "Marster !"&#xD;
" Well," growled the young man, arrested by the misery of h&#xD;
tcne..&#xD;
" I'm tired to death, sar, with holding my tongue."&#xD;
"Humph!"&#xD;
"And my heart's ready to burst, sar, with having nothing; to say!"&#xD;
"Talk, then.!"&#xD;

tone, he said-" ' Fore de Lord, oar, I's berry glad as how we's done&#xD;

lastin' ruination !"-&#xD;
" Sirrah !"-burst forth the young man, wheeling around upon&#xD;
the negro with a suddenness and fury that caused the latter to fall&#xD;
back and retreat into the middle of the street, where, with wildly&#xD;
rolling eyes, chattering teeth and quavering voice, he exclaimed:&#xD;
"He's 'witched a'ready i I know'd it ! Oh, marster! for hebbens&#xD;
sake, sar, don't look at me dat ar way, and I'll nebber do so no&#xD;
"Fool! look to yourself, or you will be run over by some passing&#xD;
vehicle."I&#xD;
Pomp, still dreadfully frightened, slowly regained the sidewalk.&#xD;
"'There, idiot ! that will do; now follow me, and whatever else&#xD;
you. may do, never again to me or to any one else venture to men-&#xD;
tion this subject; if you do, I shall hear of it and deal with you&#xD;

"W all, 1 'lare to de Lord, I might be the greatest 'plomatist as&#xD;
ebber plotted, widout gittin' any 'preciation from my young marsa,"&#xD;
soliloquised Pomp as he followed his master. :&#xD;
The next evening, about nine o'clock, Harrell sat in his private&#xD;
room, with his feet upon the fender, before a cheerful fire, holding&#xD;
in one hand a glass of hot brandy and water, and in the other the&#xD;
morning paper.&#xD;
A peculiar signal given by one heavy and two very light knocks&#xD;
upon the door took his attention from the paper, and rising and&#xD;
opening the door he demanded what was wanted.-&#xD;
I'" Capt'n," said the man who was -at the door, "the cove what&#xD;
was here last night's outside and wants for to see you.&#xD;

'cracked a crib' or 'cut a wizzen.'"s                  e&#xD;
Thus saying the Captain preceded Moreland into the adjoining&#xD;
apartment. After an absence of full an hour Harrell returned with&#xD;
Moreland into the private room.&#xD;
"'How d'you like them ?"said the f-rmer, "Aren't they a fine&#xD;
lot ?"&#xD;
a"The '11 do," answered Moreland, and lighting a cigar, he walked&#xD;
aP and own the room for some time, evidently revolving in his&#xD;
mind soine deep project; at length he stopped suddenly before the&#xD;
tain, and handing him a roll of bank notes, he said:&#xD;
"Here is the money I prmised you; if your men do their work&#xD;
ft itlifully, this shall be doubled. You have your instructions, follow-&#xD;
em and all will be well."&#xD;

A few hours later Walter Moreland was on his way to Washington.&#xD;
CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
A short time after Ella had given her consent to the marriage&#xD;
ith Col. Leonard, she received an invitation from her friend, Mrs.&#xD;
,Farnsworth, to make her house her home during her stay in Wash-&#xD;
and to be married there. This invitation Ella accepted.&#xD;
during thEe afternoon o the da appointed for the celebration of&#xD;

Slowly Ella Cameron stepped up the broad staircase; and when&#xD;
she had reached the head of it, she turned o the 'iht, and entered&#xD;
her own well-furnishid, handsome roome.&#xD;
The sunlight was streaming in oibough the rose-colored curtains,&#xD;
singing the whole interior with its own rose-hue, and Ella  alked&#xD;
across the' Brussel's carpet 'and stood before the polishedm&#xD;

"Listen," rejoined his friend. They had withdrawn into the&#xD;
shadow of a deep window, where they had a view of the whole&#xD;
moving throng, while they were unobserved. "Listen to me a mo-&#xD;
ment: do you see that young man leaning against the marble statue,&#xD;
just opposite us? Mark his flashing eye, his palid cheek, his com-&#xD;
pressed lips.  The rejoicing of this night is to him the knell of hopes&#xD;
buried forever. I wonder that he is here. It must be agony to him&#xD;
to witness the ceremony that unites her to another."&#xD;
"He certainly does look desperate," said the officer; and judg.&#xD;
ing by the fiery gleam of his eye, I should think his love charged&#xD;
to hatred."&#xD;
"It is reported they were once betrothed and that he has loved&#xD;
her with all the passionate ferver of a child of the sunny South,'&#xD;
replied his friend; "I say has loved, for I doubt not you have seen&#xD;
the truth at a glance-his love imay be changed to hatred; and '1&#xD;
fear that his revenge will be a fearful one."&#xD;
"1The saints forbid. I would have no evil befall that blushing&#xD;
rose. Despite her faithlessness, I can forgive all for the sake of&#xD;
her rare beauty. But you have not told me why 'a change came&#xD;
o'er the spirit of her dream.' "&#xD;
"Well, thus the story runs: Walter Moreland, the son of a south-&#xD;
en gentleman, who, dying, left his son Walter a fine fortune; but he&#xD;
being careless, in some wild speculation, lost his all. This was not&#xD;
known to Miss Cameron or her proud father until lately; but when&#xD;
it came to their knowledge the match was broken off. She could&#xD;
not become the bride of a poor man, and she heartlessly gave up&#xD;
Moreland's love for the wealthy position and splendid establishment&#xD;
of Col. Leonard."&#xD;
Beauty and grace were combined in many a fair figure which flit-'&#xD;
ted through the mazes of the dance. Smiles on every lip, and over&#xD;
ill flashed the brilliant light from many a chandelier ; while in the&#xD;
polished mirrors the bright scene was reflected again and again. No&#xD;
one would have dreamed that amid the glittering pageant were&#xD;
aching hearts; or that dark revengeful thoughts were Turking be.&#xD;
neath the smiling hp and courteous manner of at least one in that&#xD;
fair assembly.--Hours passed, guest after guest was departing, and&#xD;
but few yet remained. Thus reminded of the lapse of tne, Harry&#xD;
Courtley hastily bid Mrs. Farnsworth good night and left -he house.&#xD;
About an hour later a tall, powerful man, apparently abot forty or&#xD;
forty-five years old, emerged from a small frame house in tht utskirts&#xD;
of the city.  He was dressed in a garb of black cloth, cut into a&#xD;
frock, or shirt, which was secured at the waist by a broad pistol belt;&#xD;
lie wore a heavy pair of riding boots, the tops of which reached&#xD;
above the knees; his eyes were dark and gleaming, and deeply set&#xD;
beneath the heavy brows; his mouth and chin were almost wholly&#xD;
concealed by the thick grizzly beard which covered them, and vhich&#xD;
hung down upon his breast; his hair hung knotted and tangle&#xD;
about his broad shoulders.  A horse was fastened near, which had&#xD;
the appearance of bein strong of limb and swift of foot.&#xD;
"Time presses, and  must be off, lest I arrive too late," said the&#xD;
stranger, springing into the saddle at a single bound, and sinking&#xD;

the sharp rowels deep into the flanks of his horse, and holding the&#xD;
reins with a nervous grip, he dashed away at a headlong rate.&#xD;
On ! on ! good Casper !" he cried, speaking eagerly to his horse.&#xD;
A thousand minutes seem crowded into one. Pardon the spur, par.&#xD;
don the whip! Thou shalt rest after this !-On! On !"&#xD;
On they went, over rocks and over sand, till they came to a point&#xD;
where the path swept over the hill into the wood. Here theyturned&#xD;
and sped on faster than before. , Like the wind the noble beast&#xD;
leaped through the dark forest, never faltering, never swerving, till&#xD;
the face of a great black ledge of rock appeared directly across the&#xD;
path ahead. Here drawing rein, the stranger dismounted and close-&#xD;
ly examined the earth thereabout.&#xD;
Ha !" cried he, they have not yet arrived, but it will not be long&#xD;
before they are here."&#xD;
IHe was engaged in fastening his horse to a neighboring tree, when&#xD;
he was startled by the report of a pistol; but it broke upon the ear&#xD;
with so many echoes that it was impossible to tell- in what quarter&#xD;
the sound originated.&#xD;
CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
The carriage containing Col. Leonard and his bride, which was&#xD;
to convey them to the railroad depot, was driven at a rapid pace&#xD;
down the street, and having left the city the horses were urged to&#xD;
their utmost speed. The blinds of the carriage being closed its oc-&#xD;
cupants did not observe that they had left the city far behind and&#xD;
were now dashing rapidly through a dark forest.&#xD;
At length, alarmed at the delay in arriving at the depot notwith-&#xD;
standing the rapid pace at which they had been driven, Leonard&#xD;
opened the door of the carriage, and. looking out, comprehended&#xD;
their situation at a glance. They were now ascending a long hill,&#xD;
upon the one side of the road was a steep ascent, and orn the other&#xD;
adeep chasm yawned, along the bottom of which a mountain tor-&#xD;
rent rushed boiling and surging over its rocky bed. Leaping out,&#xD;
-eonard rushed to the front of the horses, and seizing them by the&#xD;
thead brought them to a sudden stop.&#xD;
"Villairf! what is the meaning of this?" dried he to the men&#xD;

One of the men jumped down, and with a tiger-like leap sprang&#xD;
upon Let iard and bore him to the earth. The other ruffian was&#xD;
about going to the assistance of his companion, when the horses, be-&#xD;
ing frightened, became almost entirely unruly, and it was with great&#xD;
dificulty that the man who had hold of the reins could keep-,hem&#xD;
from rushing over the cliff dragging the carriage after them.  In&#xD;
the mean time Leonard struggled manfully with his opponent. If&#xD;
the rufian was agile and powerful, the Colonel was no less so; and&#xD;
though taken by surprise, as he fell he drew a pistol, and:nstantly&#xD;
discharged it at the head of his assailant. The ball whistled harm.&#xD;
lessly by, and the surer weapon of the ruffiap's grasp was employed'&#xD;
to as deadly a purpose. The Qaolonel felt that he was being dragged&#xD;
to the edge of' the precipice. The desperation of intense fear lent&#xD;

him strength to resist, but in vain for his own preservation. Slowly&#xD;
the struggling twain neared the horrid brink, till they stood upon&#xD;
its direct verge,-when despairing of future attempts to save himself,&#xD;
Leonard fastened with vice-like grip upon the belt of his adversary,&#xD;
whose last reckless effort precipitated 'both into the dreaded gulf&#xD;
together!&#xD;
Ella, who was a horrified witness of the death of her husband,&#xD;
fell back insensible as' the last sharp cry of the murdered man&#xD;
reached her ear as his'body fell a mangled mass upon the icy rocks&#xD;
a hundred fathoins down. After some time the remaining ruffian&#xD;
succeeded in quieting the horses, and descending from his seat,&#xD;
walked to the edge of the precipice and gazed into the pitchy dark-&#xD;
ness.  He listened, but he could hear nothing except the roaring 4&#xD;
the wind and the rush of waters.&#xD;
" Well, they're both done for, that's certing," said he, "pooe&#xD;
Jack,'he's gone up.  Well, he died game.  My eyes, but won't the&#xD;
Cap'n cu.s some when he hears tell of this night's'work ? I wouldn t&#xD;
like to be that cove what hired us to do this job.,- When Cap a&#xD;
Harrell hears of this he'll make him come down heavy with tie&#xD;
blunt or he'll know the reason why.-.-But while I stand pattering&#xD;
Tere that gal might cut her lucky, and then I'd;be in for it with a&#xD;
yuengeance.' Thus sying, he stepped into the carriage, and taking&#xD;
the inanimate formed Ella in'his powerful arms;"ie lifted her out&#xD;
as easily as if she had been a child. "Taking a battle from his pocket&#xD;
Ire moistened her lips and bathed her forehead with its contents,&#xD;
which soon restored her to consciousness. Unfastening one of ti.e'&#xD;
horses from the carriage, the man took her again in his arms, azd&#xD;
mounting the horse rode into the woods.  It had now become suffli&#xD;
_etirtly light to enable the ruffian to see a considet-able distance&#xD;
ahead, and he urged thle horse onward with a4 much speed as, pra-&#xD;
ticable. As soon as Ella was sufficiently recovered to realize her&#xD;
situation aind.remember the past, she began struggling to free ler-&#xD;
self, but as well might the lamb strive to escape the claws of the&#xD;
lion, or the hare the eagle's gallons.&#xD;
"Unhand me, wretch !" she cried, "will not the death-of my&#xD;
husband satisfy your thirst for blood, but you must seek he life of&#xD;
a defenceless woman! Fi nd! Monster!! COWARD!!!&#xD;
"Easy, easy, my lady bird,.I don't intend to do y~u no particu-&#xD;
lar harm; but don't call me ugly names, I can't stand that; it riles.&#xD;
me, and when my bloo s up I might be rough with you."&#xD;
At this moment theii further progress was impeded by the strange&#xD;
horseman whom we de cribed in the last chapter.&#xD;
"Stop ." said he, "  hither are you carrying that lady against&#xD;
her will ?"&#xD;
"Move out of my wa , Mister, or I'll put an ounce of cold lead&#xD;

" Oh ! save me, sir, wh ever you are, and heaven will reward you!t&#xD;
Oh ! save me from aL worse than death !" cried Ella, frantically.&#xD;
he villain now produced a pistol anId presented it at the -east&#xD;
of the stranger, w.io, before lhe could fire, sent a bullet crashing&#xD;
through the ruffian s brain. As soon as he knew that his shot had&#xD;

CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
After the adjournment of Congress the term for  wh her bus-&#xD;
banld wats electd having expired,  r.Frsorhrmvdt&#xD;
ew York City, and Ella Cameron, or rather Mrs. Leonard, was&#xD;
her guest.                            Mrs. F rnsworth's large&#xD;
In the splendidly furnished parlorsof         o   th lae one&#xD;
and handsome house, two persons were sitting togethervite oe&#xD;
night. They were youthful, of opposite sexes ,and evidently, lovers.&#xD;
Bot.h  y were anlyo , oand handsome, the lady especially so.&#xD;
Both were elegatldy Ere e ,gentlkman Walter Moreland. After he&#xD;

The dainty clock upon temncrse, many soft endearmelits,&#xD;
night, when, withI many tender caresses,) aysf edamns&#xD;
iht lovers se  ted, and the young man departed from the house.&#xD;
Uonthe rsseparateae of her lover, the lady cast herself upon&#xD;
Upon the disappearance    d that her thoughts were of a pleasant&#xD;
character, the smile that wreathed her bright red lips fully indicated.&#xD;
Suddenly the door of the room was very silently opened, and a&#xD;
manentered the apartme, and without disturbing the lady, glided&#xD;
anftly  re tohe apar(This was a new servant-one John Weston,&#xD;
as he called himsef-who had beert engaged by Mrs. Farnsworth,&#xD;
on his own application but a few days previous.)   J&#xD;
After regaraling the beautiful Ella for a few moments, John made&#xD;
Aftrapigardwmht at on'e aroused the lady from her abstraction.&#xD;
a scraping bow t t  nearound exclaimed:&#xD;
"Whats the mtr John'? I did not ring."&#xD;
"6 What's the miatter,th  e ? is"&#xD;
" I thought I heard teblMs.&#xD;
You were nstakn    de no offer to retire. After a few mo-&#xD;
john stood still and maden&#xD;

"You can go, John&#xD;

Still John remained motionless uphe sointentl readn&#xD;

&#xD;
ii&#xD;
A&#xD;
~&#xD;
&#xD;
1I was thinking how handsome you are, Miss; and wondering&#xD;
which I should rather have, you or your diamonds."&#xD;
At first Ella flashe upangrily, but the next moment she seemed&#xD;
to. take another view of the speech and laughed heartily.&#xD;
A  nd which do yofx think you would prefer ?" she inquired with&#xD;
a smile.&#xD;
I)rawing up his figure to its full height, and instantly changing&#xD;
'Fis whole appearance, John responded in an entirely altered tone of&#xD;
vuice:&#xD;
The jewels!"&#xD;
The lady gazed at the servant in utter amazement. He was an&#xD;
altered being, no longer the humble menial, but a bright, quick,&#xD;
Airm, resolute man.,&#xD;
" What is the meaning of this'?" she demanded in tones of alarm.&#xD;
Quick as a flash the man stepped close up beside her and grasped&#xD;
her arm.&#xD;
"I1want them jewels, and everything else of value you have&#xD;
about!" he exclaimed intones that were not to be mistaken.&#xD;
"Would you rob me'?"&#xD;
"Yes, robbery is my business !"&#xD;
Ella would have screamed out with the terror of her emotions, but&#xD;
H1arrell-for it was he-quickly clapped his hand over her mouth and&#xD;
smothered the sound. Then drawing a pistol from his pocket with&#xD;
his other hand, he said:&#xD;
- If you value your life, keep quiet, and do what I tell you-"..&#xD;
Then removing his hand from the hidy's mouth, he continued:&#xD;
" As I told you afore, Ma'am, I'll take them jewels and what.&#xD;
ever else you've got of value."&#xD;
Silently Ella divested herself of her valuable diamonds, and emp,&#xD;
tied her pursetf its glittering contents; and as she laid down each&#xD;
article Ilprrell picked it up and dropped it into his pocket. At&#xD;
length the robber seemed satisfied.&#xD;
" I believe, Ma'am, that the diamonds are the most valuable things&#xD;
in the house, and I'll not look any further,"-said Ilarrell, as with a&#xD;
quick, catlike movement, he glided out of the rooui.&#xD;
WhenMoreland was told of what had happened, 'he determined&#xD;
to capture the robber; but how could Walter hope to entrap this&#xD;
daring and cunning man, when all the police of New York could&#xD;
not accomplish that result'? Well informed as the young man cer-&#xD;
tainly was, he had undertaken a difficult task.  How he prospered&#xD;
we shall see.&#xD;
The next day an article appeared in the  apers stating that if&#xD;
John Weston would call at Mrs. Farnsworth's at such a time on&#xD;
such a;n evening an offer would be made him for certain articles in&#xD;
his possession that would fully compensate him for returning them.&#xD;
This was Walter Moreland's first move, and simple enough it&#xD;
seemed ; and yetits transparency was just the thing to provoke the&#xD;
reckless and defiant spirit of Harrell.&#xD;
The night indicated in the advertisement arrived and everything&#xD;
was ,prepared for the robber's capture in case he should make his&#xD;

OF&#xD;
CHARLES L. MARSHALL,&#xD;
AND HIS LOST BRIDE,&#xD;
CORNELIA DUNNINGTONT.&#xD;
My history affords a frightful example of the vicissitudes of for.&#xD;
tune. My father, who was more'distinguished by his virtue and&#xD;
superior attainments than by his wealth, enjoyed that consideration&#xD;
which is always due to personal merit. He gave to the education&#xD;
of my two sisters the attention of a tender father; but above all&#xD;
he occupied himself with mine, with the zeal of an old gentleman&#xD;
jealous of the honor of his name.&#xD;
I learned horsemanship, gymnastics and sword exercise, atAa&#xD;
school in Philadelphia, where these branches of a gentleman's educa-&#xD;
tion were taught. At this school I'made the acquaintancelo&#xD;
young man, named Percy Elmore, who distinguished himself armoff&#xD;
the scholars by the most amiable qualities. To the charms of a&#xD;
face, at the same time handsome and noble, he joined a cultivated&#xD;
mmd. The uncommon address which he displayed in our games,&#xD;
the modesty with which he strove to conceal his own and to ealt&#xD;
the merits of his companions . the urbanity of his manners,"he&#xD;
sereneness of his temper; fixed the attention, commn ded theesteem,&#xD;
and rendered him dear to that brilliant circle of youth wh 8hked&#xD;
our labors and our pastime. To say that it was a reseinblanco of&#xD;
character that brought about a friendship between Young -Elmore&#xD;
and myself, would be praising myself very'much but however that&#xD;
may have been, it is certain that we soon became very intimate.&#xD;
How happy is that stage of existence-but oh! how siftly does&#xD;
it pass away-when we are yet ignorant bioth of the ambition w which&#xD;
sacrifices everything to the pursuit of fortune and of gloy, and of&#xD;
that love-which absorbs all our faculties, and centres them upon one&#xD;
only object; that age of innocent pleasures' and ,of confiding cre-&#xD;
dulity, when the heart, yet new, follows freely the impulses of its&#xD;

rising sensibility, and gives itself without division to the object of&#xD;
its disinterested affection. Then friendship is not merely a name.&#xD;
The confidant of all the secrets of Mr. Elmore, I concealed on my&#xD;
part nothing from him; his counsels ruled my conduct, mine influ-&#xD;
enced his, and thus our school days had no pleasures which were not&#xD;
divided, no cares which were not lightened by that pleasing reciproci-&#xD;
ty of feeling. With what grief I saw the fatal moment arrive when&#xD;
Young Elmore, forced by paternal orders toquit Philadelphia, bade&#xD;
me farewell I We promised to preserve through all time that strong&#xD;
attachment, whichh had been the happiness of .our youth, and I boldly&#xD;
swore that the passions of a more advanced age should never alter&#xD;
my feelings.&#xD;
What a void was left in my heart by the absence of my friend !&#xD;
At first it seemed to me that nothing could remunerate me for his&#xD;
loss. The tenderness of a father, the affection of my sisters, when&#xD;
I, too, returfled to my native town, but slightly consoled me. Per-&#xD;
ceiving that there was no other way to divert my mind from its&#xD;
grief than to occupy it with some useful labor, I learned the French&#xD;
language, and applied myself earnestly to the study of the politics&#xD;
of the country and the law. Several years were employed in these&#xD;
studies, until at length they occupied me entirely. Percy Elmore&#xD;
wrote to me often, but received in return short and dull answers;&#xD;
our correspondence languished more and more, until at length love&#xD;
triumphed over friendship.&#xD;
My father had been for a long time an intimate friend of Captain&#xD;
Dunnington, a gentleman of great wealth, renowned in our neigh-&#xD;
borhood for his austerity of manner, and for the inflexibility 'of his&#xD;
attachment to the political principles he espoused. Mr. Dunnington&#xD;
might well be called a brave man as a politician, for he had signa-&#xD;
lized himself by freely expending his money in more than one&#xD;
campaign. Like those ancient heroes of whom we read, Captain&#xD;
Dunnington would have sacrificed all his wealth to the prosperity and&#xD;
success of his party, he would have shed the last drop of his bWood&#xD;
in defence of the platform of his principles; he would even have&#xD;
sacrificed his' only daughter-his dear Cornelia.&#xD;
Cornelia ! how beautiful she was ! how much I loved her .ther&#xD;
lear name is ever upon my lips-her adored image in my heart!&#xD;
when I had seen er, I thenceforth saw nothing but her. I abandon-&#xD;
ed my studies, my friendship was entirely forgotten, I consecrated&#xD;
all my moments to Cornelia. It was impossible that my father or&#xD;
hers should long remain ignorant of my attachnment; but they spoke&#xD;

not of it, -and therefore I supposed approved it.. I accordingly en.&#xD;
joyed without inquietude my new and blissful emotion. I contrived&#xD;
to see her almost every ,day, ,either at.her own home -or at that of&#xD;
my sisters,: whom she: loved very much. Thus two yeafs passed&#xD;
away,; during which time I. paid' no particular attention to political&#xD;
matters.&#xD;
At length Captain Dunnington called me aside one day, and said&#xD;
to me:&#xD;
" Your father and myself, Charles, have hitherto founded great&#xD;
hspes upon you, which your conduct at first seemed to justify.; for&#xD;
we saw you duriig a long time employ yourself in labors as honora-&#xD;
ble as they are useful. Now"-&#xD;
He saw that I was about to interrupt him-and prevented me..&#xD;
"What would you say to me ? - Do you suppose that you can tell&#xD;
me anything of which I am ignorant? Is it, necessary for me to&#xD;
be every day a witness of your transports to know how much Cor-&#xD;
nelia merits to be loved?  It is because I know as well as you what&#xD;
she deserves, that you shall never obtain 'her except by meriting&#xD;
her. Young man, know that it is not enough that weaknesses are&#xD;
legitimate to make them excusable. , Those of a good citizen ought&#xD;
all to turn to the profit of his country'; for even love itself Mwould&#xD;
be, like the viler passions, contemptible and dangerous, if it did not&#xD;
offer to generous hearts one motive the more to excite them to honor.&#xD;
Listdn,: the strength of our party in this Congressional District is&#xD;
failing. and I wish to be its' candidate for Congress. This has&#xD;
awakened the ambition of my personal opponents, 'and they are&#xD;
prying themselves, without doubt, to sow. dissension among us&#xD;
the' design , by forcing the suffrages of the people, to give Ub a&#xD;
nomination of their choice. Already a number of active young&#xD;
men have started out canvassing votes' for me; go at; once to 'tie&#xD;
city-this, very day-and join' yourself to that patriotic band-which&#xD;
I have had secretly organized there; show yourself, by your actions&#xD;
during the campaign, to be, worthy of my: daughter. aHere is a&#xD;
letter of'-instructins. - Follow them!"&#xD;
I took the letter and did not hesitate a moment.  My father ap-&#xD;
proved my decision-.he belonging to the same party-b$t it was&#xD;
with reluctance',that he consented to my. precipitate departure that&#xD;
day. 'Captain Dunnington was present when I bade Cornelia farewell"&#xD;
It was a. sad, moving'-scene, for she h4d read so much about the&#xD;
dangers. attendant upon, an election campaign in a city which con-&#xD;
tained its seet bands: of organized politicians, thatphe' greatly-&#xD;
feared for my safety. She wept freely.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="48-51" xml:id="VAC8360-00000022"/>&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
"Dry your tears, child," he said to her stoically, "or keep them&#xD;
until after you are wedded. It is not fitting for my daughter to&#xD;
weepover a brief separation from her lover."&#xD;
Cornelia turned pale, sighed,. glanced blushingly at her father,&#xD;
and assured me with a trembling voice, that her prayers should&#xD;
hasten my return, and that her happiness was in my hands.&#xD;
Thus encouraged, what danger could appal me? I departed and&#xD;
attached myself to one of the polite il clubs of the city; but'noth-&#xD;
ing occurred in the course of that -cmpaign for nominating a can-&#xD;
didate for Congress worthy to be recorded, except that by general&#xD;
consent, Captain Dunnington was laid asideingorer to give room&#xD;
for a new aspirant, with the distinct understanding, however, that&#xD;
the forjner should receive the nomination for Governor by the Con-&#xD;
vention for selecting the candidate for that office, which would meet&#xD;
in a few months hence.&#xD;
I returned home full of impatience and joy, not doubting  ut&#xD;
that I might immediately claim the 'hand of Cornelia. Horrible&#xD;
news awaited me. I hadno longer a father, for I learned that he&#xD;
had died four days previously of appoplexy!  He was already&#xD;
buried 1 Thus I had not even the sad consolation of receiving the&#xD;
last blessing of the most tender of parents. I could only go to his&#xD;
tomb, which I watered with my tears. On returning from the&#xD;
grave-yard I met Captain Dunnington, who seemed but little moved&#xD;
at my grief.&#xD;
"It is not with useless tears," said he to me,  that the memory&#xD;
of a father; like yours, should be honored. Odr party mourns in&#xD;
him a&amp;amp;hero-citizen, who would have usefully served it in the sp.'&#xD;
proaching-.crisis. He was formerly a member of Assembly from&#xD;
this district, and doubtless would have been selected as a delegate&#xD;
to the Gubernatorial Convention ; and on the choice of the delegate&#xD;
to that body from this district depends my nomination. Of all the&#xD;
rights, your. father has transmitted to you that of representing this&#xD;
districtin the forthcoming convention, if you are selected, is with-&#xD;
out doubt, the most important. It is in such positions that he ought&#xD;
to live again in you. If you are appointed as the delegate, which&#xD;
I doubt not you will be, you will have to exhibit a courage far&#xD;
greater than that which consists only in braving death upon the&#xD;
battle field. The valor of the soldier is only a common virtue&#xD;
but they are no ordinary myp who, preserving a tranquil courage&#xD;
iii the greatest emergencies of State, discover the projects of pow&#xD;
edful conspirators, defeat dangerous plots,.affront hardy factions&#xD;

our party is in danger.  But I promise you that when you bring&#xD;
me the news that I have received the nomination for Governor, you&#xD;
shall have her."&#xD;
Captain Dunnington was a monomaniac in politics, and, as Iknew&#xD;
his nature, I listened to him calmly. I was well aware I should&#xD;
have many' important duties to perform in order to secure him the&#xD;
nomination, (for he was not-ver popular with the younger members&#xD;
of the party torwhichahe belonged,) but I undertook them the more&#xD;
freely because they would, in some degree, divert my mind from its&#xD;
harrowing grief caused by my father's demise. I avow it with&#xD;
shame, that the sadness and compassionate grief of my sisters was&#xD;
banished by the more reserved but not the less valued caresses of&#xD;
Cornelia. I saw that she was affected at iny irreparable loss, and&#xD;
as much afflicted as myself at the cruel events which deferred our&#xD;
marriage. My grief, 'thus shared, became sensibly lessened.&#xD;
In the meantime the convention was called. I had been appoioted&#xD;
a delegate, and made my way to the county town. The day on&#xD;
which it was to open, and at the moment I was about to repair to&#xD;
the court-house wherein it was held, an unknown person presented&#xD;
himself in my room At the hotel, and requested to see me privately.&#xD;
When the servant who conducted him 10my apartment retired, the'&#xD;
stranger threw. himself into my arms and embraced me. It was&#xD;
Percy Elmore! The four years which had rassed since our separa-&#xD;

tion, had not changed him so much but that I was able to recognize&#xD;
him, and I showed the surprise and joy which his unexpected&#xD;
presence gave me.-&#xD;
" You will be yet more surprised;" he said, "when you know the&#xD;
cause of my being here. I have this moment arrived, and am about&#xD;
going to the convention. Is it too much to presume upon your&#xD;
friendship to count upon your vote ?"&#xD;
"'Upon my vote?  And for whom ?" said I.&#xD;
For me, my friend !" retorted he, smiling.&#xD;
He saw my astonishment, and continued-&#xD;
"Yes, for. me. There is not time to relate to you what happy&#xD;
revolution in my fortune permits me to nourish such high hopes;&#xD;
Jet it suffice for you to know, that, at least, my ambition is justified&#xD;
by the greatest number of sufrages, and that, in ,,ain, two feeble&#xD;
rivals prepare to dispute with me the nomination for Governor to&#xD;
which I now aspire."&#xD;
"Marshall," he continued, "if you were not my friend, or if I&#xD;
esteemed you less, perhaps I would attempt to dazzle you with&#xD;
promises;.perhaps I would show you what favors await you in case&#xD;
of my election, what honorable distinctions I would bestow. But&#xD;
I do not wish to seduce you, I only want to persuade you to vote&#xD;
for me."&#xD;
It matters but little what language my friend used in his en-&#xD;
deavors to gain my vote ; let me 'merely mention that his reasons&#xD;
were so cogent that I voted for hita when the convention met, having&#xD;
seen that there was no earthly'hance for Captain Dunnington to&#xD;
receive, the nomination. After the adjournment of the body, and&#xD;
without seeing Mr. Dunnington, I returned home, and hastened to&#xD;
his house He was walking to and fro with rapid pace in the apart-&#xD;
ment of his daughter, to which aservant conducted me.- Cornelia,&#xD;
who was in the room, seemed:as much agitated as himself.&#xD;
" Behold 1" he said to her, when he saw me appear, "Behold the&#xD;
man whom I esteemed, and you loved, and who has sacrificed us&#xD;
both to his friendship for another !".&#xD;
I was about to answer to exculpate myself, but he continued-.&#xD;
"You have been intimate from childhood with Percy Elmore,&#xD;
who is now the candidate of our party for Governor of the State,&#xD;
supported by apowerful faction of my opponents.' You knew it !&#xD;
You knew his designss! 1 u voted for him and deceived me!&#xD;
But think no that a man can deceivemu*e with impunity I" .&#xD;
I begged' him to hear mDe, and while he constrained himself to an&#xD;
&#xD;
AND HIS LOST BRIDE, CORNELIA DUNNINGTON.&#xD;
angry silence, I explained to him how Mr. Elmore had suddenly&#xD;
came upon me and informed me of his brilliant prospects for the&#xD;
nomination, and how I had only voted for him after seeing there&#xD;
was no chance for my own candidate. Cornelia appeared delighted&#xD;
at my justification, but her father interrupted me-&#xD;
"Think not that I am to be deceived like a credulous woman I"&#xD;
,said he; "but proceed."&#xD;
I then gave him a brief account of all that took place between&#xD;
Mr. Elmore and myself. I had scarce concluded,-when he approached&#xD;
me with the utmost impetuosity, and cried-&#xD;
"You are a Traitor!   Depart this instant from my house, or I&#xD;
will have you dragged from it by my servants!"&#xD;
An affront so cruel incensed me beyond measure, and in the&#xD;
transport of my wrath I drew a revolver from my pocket. Quicker&#xD;
than lightning Captain Dunnington drew one also..But his trembling&#xD;
daughter threw herself 'between'us.&#xD;
"Charles !" she said, "what would you do ?"&#xD;
At the sound of that dear voice I regained my reason; but I&#xD;
felt that in another instant Cornelia was likely to be taken from&#xD;
me forever. -She left me to throw herself into the arms of her&#xD;
father. That cruel man saw my bitter grief and strove to augment it.&#xD;
"Go! Traitor, go!" said he, "you have seen her for the last&#xD;
tune I"&#xD;
I returned home in despair. The odious epithets which he had&#xD;
heaped upon me recurred without cessation to my thoughts. I&#xD;
could not imagine how I could betray one friend so deeply by bene-&#xD;
fating another, who would have succeeded to the position independent&#xD;
of my assistance, whilst the other, with all my aid, stood no chance&#xD;
$Whatever for it. ,I passed the entire night in that uncertainty; and&#xD;
when the day dawned, I went to the residence of Captain Dunning.&#xD;
ton, determined to effect some sort of a reconciliation. I .found&#xD;
neither him nor his daughter. One of the men employed on the&#xD;
plantation informed me that the Captain had departed the previous&#xD;
evening -with Cornelia. I inquired whither they had gone.&#xD;
"I am ignorant of that," replied the man; "all I can tell you&#xD;
is that you had scarcely gone from here yesterday evening, when a&#xD;
noise was heard in the apartment of his daughter. . Being near the&#xD;
chamber door at the time, I ventured to listen. Miss Cornelia wept,&#xD;
whilst her father, furious with wrath, swore; and I heard him say,&#xD;
"iShe who is able to love a traitor is able to be one. Ungrateful&#xD;
girl, I shall place you in a safe retreat, where you will hei eafter be&#xD;
shieldled 'from seduction !"'&#xD;

-DVENTURES OF CHARLES MARSHALL.&#xD;
How gieat now was my misery! I went home and mounted a&#xD;
horse, determined to search the country over until I found her.&#xD;
While in this frame of mind, and undecided what course to take,&#xD;
in order to learn the whereabouts of my betrothed, I received, a&#xD;
letter from Galveston, Texas, in which it was stated that I would&#xD;
find it to my 'advantage to come to that city, as those I sought were&#xD;
then there. I immediately set out for Galveston, and after a jour-&#xD;
ney of five weeks reached my destination. I could find no one,&#xD;
however, who had seen or heard tell of -them. .I concluded I was&#xD;
thus led astray and duped .by Captain Dunnington's cunning, in or-&#xD;
der that I might be cured of any future attempt at finding his&#xD;
daughter. I was about returning, and had just, settled my bill at&#xD;
the hotel, when, on going to the reading room, I was accosted by a&#xD;
rather rakish looking person, who-told me that, for a hundred dollars&#xD;
in cash,4 he would put me in possession of the lady in whom I&#xD;
appeared to be so much interested. Surprised at the fellow's unex-&#xD;
pected appearance as well as curious proposition, I questioned him&#xD;
as' to the lady's name. To my astonishment he mentioned it. and&#xD;
said she was imprisoned in a small farm house about nine miles&#xD;
distant. To this place, towards evening, he conducted me, after I&#xD;
had paid him his price. 'However, instead of finding her I so&#xD;
anxiously sought, the moment I entered the door of the hut, (for it&#xD;
was nothing else,) I was roughly seized by a couple of branny fel-&#xD;
lows, who commenced robbing me of everything I possessed. On&#xD;
pain of being instantly shot, I gave up my watch, breastpin and&#xD;
money without making any show of resistance. One of them then&#xD;
took possession of my. coat, placing on me his ragged one for a&#xD;
substitute. After noting me fQr a love sickfool, the pair of villains,&#xD;
together with my rascally conductor,.started off in high glee witlh&#xD;
three cheers for Captain Dunnington. Prior to teir leaving me I&#xD;
was bound hand and foot, and tightly fastened with my back to the&#xD;
wall. I struggled in vain to undo the cords that- confined me by&#xD;
the wrists, and was about giving up in despair, when to my horror&#xD;
and astonishment, I fohnd the villains had fired the cabin on tl'e&#xD;
outside,! In a few minutes the clapboard roof was in a blaze, and&#xD;
the room I was in became instantly filled with smoke! Soon the&#xD;
flames were crackling over my head, and large pieces of the blazng&#xD;
roof were falling upon me. 'The idea of being burnt alive was&#xD;
shocking, 'and I renewed my exertions, to free myself from my&#xD;
bonds. The fire was becoming hotter and hotter, and I was on the&#xD;
point of being roasted alive, when fortunately a piece of burning&#xD;
board fell and lodged directly on my two wrists which were tied to-&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
55&#xD;
&#xD;
gether! 'The cuffs of the old coat were quickly on fire, as was also&#xD;
the rope which 'confined me. The pain was excruciating, but I&#xD;
suffered the awful torment until the rope burnt suficiently to allow&#xD;
me to break it, which I did by a superhuman effort. The moment&#xD;
my wrists were free I began untying the cord which bound me to&#xD;
the wall, scarcely having done which, the entire room was in a blaze!&#xD;
I darted out the door with all speed, and it was lucky I did'- for at&#xD;
that moment the roof fell in with a terrible crash.&#xD;
I was now in a miserable plight, and regretted having allowed&#xD;
myself to be decoyed into so foul a snare. But there was no help&#xD;
for it. So I wended my way back to Galveston, resolved on the&#xD;
next day to wreak my vengeance on the foul villains who had thus&#xD;
misused me; and I further determined that in'case I met Cptain&#xD;
Dunnington he should answer to me personally for the vile actA pf&#xD;
his hired emmissaries.&#xD;
It was -midnight when I reachedGalveston, and the streets were&#xD;
deserted. I made my way to the hotel,' where my appearance excited&#xD;
the sympathy of the landlord and several of the guests who had&#xD;
not yet retired. All were loud in'their condemnation of the villain-&#xD;
ous outrage which had been perpetrated upon me, and a company&#xD;
was made up to go in search of the. authors of the deed the next&#xD;
morning. My wrists were but slightly injured by -the fire, and I&#xD;
agreed to accompany the party who one and all made up their minds&#xD;
to hang the rascals without mercy should we catch them. Atseven&#xD;
in the morning the body of mounted men, who were to accompany,&#xD;
weve 'all in readiness, and we made directly for the cabin to which&#xD;
I had been decoyed. We found a mass of smouldering embers. , A&#xD;
division of the force was then agreed upon, some going north and&#xD;
tho others west. The party which I accompanied soon came upon&#xD;
the trail of the desparadoes, who had taken a short cut through a&#xD;
freshly ploughed field. After half an hours' hard riding we suidden-&#xD;
ly came in view of them, as they were sitting round a liquor bottle,&#xD;
buily engaged in a game of cards. We rode in upon them with,'a&#xD;
shout, and in a few minutes had them prisoners. . They prayed us&#xD;
mercy, but it was not granted. One of them earnestly entreated&#xD;
me to spare him, and"in answer to my question as to ihat part&#xD;
CAptain Dunnington had taken in the matter, he replied that that&#xD;
ge;ntlemza had only intimated to them that he wished me to be&#xD;
laughed at, not abused; but that the sight of the watch,-and the&#xD;
money I was supposed to be the possessor of, was the sole incentive&#xD;
unich led them to rob and bind me; and that in ordersto-cover the&#xD;
Pi tme of the robbery they had set the hut on fire. This villain: I&#xD;

would hai a spared, but the gentlemen who accompanied me insist&#xD;
on serving them all alike. Wo now formed ourselves into a court; tried&#xD;
them, and found them guilty of robbery, and, an attempt to murder.&#xD;
They were sentenced to be hanged to the nearest tree, allowing&#xD;
them half an hour to pray. . But . one of them, however, availtd&#xD;
himself of the benefits of prayer, while the other two heaped upon&#xD;
us all manner of imprecations. The time allowed being up, we&#xD;
commenced hanging them. This was quickly gone through With,&#xD;
and a hole being scraped out of the soft earth with snome points&#xD;
sticks, we huddled them together and covered them over with dirt&#xD;
and leaves. V e then returned to Galveston, from whence, after&#xD;
remaining a few days longer, I took my departure for home.&#xD;
Having lost eight weeks in my painful search I now resolved to s.k&#xD;
for her in the various cities. After much inquiry in New York, 1 ea ee&#xD;
upon a person who had seen Captain Dunnipgton the day b-fure.&#xD;
I sent this -party to seek out the place where he was stopping, if&#xD;
possible, and bring me word. I instructed him, when he once saw&#xD;
theCaptain, not to lose sight of him, but to follow him wherever&#xD;
he went. In, two days my agent. returned and apprised me tbat he&#xD;
ha4 observed the Captain take a carriage and ride in the dirnotion&#xD;
of the Jersey City Ferry, whither he followed him. The yiver&#xD;
was crossed, with my spy on the same boat with the Captair.- and.&#xD;
when the slip was reached both parties-started on foot., Night was&#xD;
fast approaching, yet the Captain walked briskly on up the it-reet&#xD;
and out of the town, still followed by my agent. The sun unkt&#xD;
below the earth, and the stars refused to shine, but the pedestrian&#xD;
walked on. Several hours passed, and there was as yet n, -sign&#xD;
that the Captain's journey was concluded. By this time ho- was&#xD;
aware that'he was watched. At length he stopped to rest himself,&#xD;
and cast a glance towards, the man who was following him. MY&#xD;
agent secreted himself behind some. old ruins,, to screen himself&#xD;
from observation. Presently the Captain rushed up and seized. him,&#xD;
ad with a pistol in his fiand, forced him, to confess who it was that&#xD;
ent him on his prying expedition.&#xD;
"IABill send you back to the traitor !" said he, addressing my&#xD;
agent, "sa- tell him for me that he shall not escape my just. ven-&#xD;
,anesr" .With these words he dismissed him end bade him take.&#xD;

his only child, and oheriass, nd I'exp6sed inyelf to e  il&#xD;
to discover his retreat and her prison.&#xD;
After spending'three months in vain searches, despairing of being&#xD;
able to find my lost love, for a time I gave myself up to 'grief.&#xD;
was on my return home, when. an extraordinary and dangerous&#xD;
encounter forced me to take a very different course. I started for&#xD;
my residence on horseback, preferring that mode of travelling to&#xD;
the more modern and swift railroad car. On the evening of a&#xD;
beautiful day, in October, I was leisurely walking my animal down&#xD;
the turnpike which crosses the Blue Mountains between the towns of&#xD;
Emmittsburg, Md., and Waynesborough, Pa, when, on a sudden, I&#xD;
was attacked by four men, evidently robbers. Fdrtunately I was armed&#xD;
with a revolver. Two of the villains seized the riins of my horse's&#xD;
bridle, whilst the other two attempted to drag me from his back. I&#xD;
hesitated not an instant, but fired at one of the two-who were trying&#xD;
to unhorse me. He fell with a scream of agony, while the others&#xD;
took to their heels through the thick shrubbery that covered the&#xD;
mountain side, foar balls from my revolver following them. I die-&#xD;
mounted, and was about putting another bullet"into the wounded&#xD;
robber, when he begged of me, in a faint voice, to listen to what he&#xD;
had to say. He then spoke as follows:&#xD;
"As brave-a man as you are ought to be generous. I ask of&#xD;
you my life. Friend, instead of killing me; bind lip this dreadful&#xD;
wound in my arm."&#xD;
He craved quarter in so piteous a manner, that I assisted him to&#xD;
his feet. I then took from my pocket a handkerchief and bandaged&#xD;
his arm. Whilst doing this, I observed a crowd of ten or twelve&#xD;
men hastily descending the side of the mountain on which we were&#xD;
standing.. A horrid presentiment of instant death ,came over me,&#xD;
for my pistol then contained but a single charge. The robber be-&#xD;
side me, noticing my fear and agitation, said in a calhm voice:&#xD;
"iFear nothing, young man ! I am the leader of those men andi&#xD;
they will not harm You when they see that I am alive !&#xD;
By a signal of his hand he checked the approach of the band,&#xD;
who were hastening towards us. He then spoke again:&#xD;
.4"'Friend, the day is now departing, and I advise you not to travel&#xD;
farther down this mountain to-night. Some of my men are on tfieir&#xD;
posts, and as I cannot see them until to-morrow, I will not be- re-&#xD;
sp,.msible for your safety. Below here you will find a pathway that&#xD;
leads to a rude, though strongly built house, belonging to' a rich-old&#xD;
man, who, villain as he is, once did me a grevious injury. Go' you&#xD;
to that house, and ask him to give you an asylum for the night.&#xD;

A DVENTURE OF CHARLES MARSHALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
Tell him you were beset by the robbers, and that you had wounded"&#xD;
their leader. He must know me, because I have already caused&#xD;
him some unhappy days. He robbed me of my patrimony, when I&#xD;
was an infant, and made me what I am. Do not leave there in less&#xD;
t an three' days, if he will allow you to stay, and make your visit&#xD;
IMst no longer than eight."&#xD;
The advice of the robber-chief, with his dozen assassins but a&#xD;
hundred yards from me, was of course not to be refused ; therefore I&#xD;
quickly mounted my horse, and pursued the path which struck, off&#xD;
from the main road, a few rods farther down the mountain. It&#xD;
led me down into a deep and rugged ravine, through which 'it ran&#xD;
for several miles. At length I came to what appeared to have once&#xD;
been an old stone castle, with a high tower still standing. There&#xD;
was a ditch surrounding the building, over which led a drawbridge.&#xD;
There was, however, no water in the ditch.. Jumping from- my&#xD;
horse, I fastened him to a tree; going to the gate I rapped loudly.&#xD;
An extremely ugly negro answered my summons, and demanded&#xD;
my name. I answered that my name was Dunnington, for I had&#xD;
travelled under this cognomen the better to mislead the father of&#xD;
Cornelia, should he hear of any one making inquiry after his daugh-&#xD;
ter. Presently I was admitted. The negro informed mehat the master&#xD;
was away and would not return until the morrow.  however wel-&#xD;
comed me. A frugal repast was spread, of which Ipartook, and&#xD;
at an early hour I retired to bed,.in a room on the ground fl6or. I&#xD;
soon fell asleep, and did not awaken until daybreak. On trying to&#xD;
pass out I found the door locked on the outside, so that I could not&#xD;
open it, and I made my exit from the room through a window into&#xD;
a garden, beautifully and.tastefully laid out. After walking about&#xD;
a few minutes I seated myself on a stone bench at the foot of the&#xD;
tower, and occupied myself in observing its singular architecture.&#xD;
While thus absorbed in thought, a piece of slate tile dropped upon&#xD;
me apparently from the roof of the old building; and, to avoid a&#xD;
similar accident, I removed to the opposite end of the bench. A&#xD;
few minutes afterwards a second piece of slate fell near me. The&#xD;
accident seemed surprising ; I arosealarmed; I examined the tower&#xD;
attentively, and perceived.at the distance of twenty-five or thirty&#xD;
feet from the top a window. I picked up the tiles that had been&#xD;
cast down, and on the first I deciphered these- words scratched with&#xD;
a pin:-                .~&#xD;
"Charles ! Is it you?  You still live !"&#xD;
On the second was written:&#xD;
"4Oh, deliver me-save Cornelia!"&#xD;
&#xD;
It is impossible for anyone to imagine what diverse sentiments&#xD;
agitated me at that moment. My astonishment, my grief, my em..&#xD;
barrassment, were inexpressible. I examined the prison of Cornelia,&#xD;
and sought how I should be able to rescue her from it.&#xD;
She threw down another piece of slate, on which I read:&#xD;
"At midnight bring me paper, ink and pen, and attach them to&#xD;
a string you will find dangling from thewindow. To-morrow, after&#xD;
the sun rises, look for a letter in the garden. Depart now."&#xD;
I returned, to my room through the window, and reclosed the&#xD;
blinds. How could I penetrate into the tower, and how could I&#xD;
perform this in the short space of three days, the time at which I&#xD;
wished to take my departure ? These thoughts occupied my mind&#xD;
greatly, and it was horrible to contemplate that I might not be able&#xD;
to surmount the obstacles that lay in the way of rescuing Cornelia&#xD;
from the prison in which she was confined. But for what, was she&#xD;
in that frightful prison ? The letter which she promised me would&#xD;
doubtless infform me, and it became necessary to procure the writing&#xD;
materials ere the return of the master4g'f thehouse, who, I was well&#xD;
convinced, was some particular friend, perhaps a relative, of Captain&#xD;
unningtOns  Breakfast was served me by the negro, who had&#xD;
Likewise careully attended to the wants of my horse. 'Trom him&#xD;
so*I proeied the writing materials. I then strolled around the&#xD;
place and through the garden until noon, when I was apprised Mr.&#xD;
Hubbard, the owner of the place, had arrived. I presented myself&#xD;
to him with all the assurance I could command under the circum-&#xD;
stances. He was a man about fifty years of age, of rough and&#xD;
repulsive manners. He asked me who I was.  I informed him, as&#xD;
I had previously done the negro,-&#xD;
"Myuncle, Captain. Dunnington, said I, has given me a secret&#xD;
mission for you, but in order to explain that mission I must be alone&#xD;
wjth you. On my way hither I was attacked by a gang of out-&#xD;
laws, the leader of which I wounded severely with a ball' from my&#xD;
pistol,&#xD;
With a move of his hand, the negro, (who was present when J&#xD;
made up to Mr. Hubbard), left the apartment.&#xD;
Captain Dunnington sent me-1 began.&#xD;
"'I see it very well-that he sent you," answer Ad Hubbard.&#xD;
To ask-stammered I.&#xD;
" What?" he inquired.&#xD;
I took courage.&#xD;
To ask news of his daughter, continued I.&#xD;
"News of his daughter !" answered he.&#xD;

ADVENTURES 01 CHARLES MARSHALL,&#xD;

" Mr. Dunnington said it ?"-Yes, Captain Dunnington said his&#xD;
dau hter, Cornelia, was here.&#xD;
I saw Hubbard turn pale. He looked at me a long time in silence.&#xD;
" You astonish me !'" said he at length. " Captain Dunnington&#xD;
must have been very imprudent to have trusted you with a secret&#xD;
of so great importance."&#xD;
Not more than you would do, sir, replied I. Have you no confi-&#xD;
dant ? We.would be a very unfortunate set of people if we could&#xD;
place no confidance in any one. Captain Dunnington bade me say&#xD;
to you that young Marshall, the traitor, to whom his daughter was&#xD;
engaged, has already travelled over a great part of the country in&#xD;
search of her, and that there is a probability he will visit this sec-&#xD;
tion.   '       :&#xD;
"If he dares to come here," said Hubbard, suddenly, "I will&#xD;
give him a lodging he will occupy for a long time., Do you know&#xD;
this young Marshall ?" .&#xD;
I have often seen him at my uncle's, I answered.&#xD;
" He is said to be a handsome man," continued he.&#xD;
He is well formed and about my height, I believe, replied I care.&#xD;
lessly.&#xD;
" He is an insolant fellow ;" remarked Hubbar d, " and if ever&#xD;
he falls into my hands, he'll rue it ! It is a long time since Dunning.&#xD;
ton wrote to me. Where is he ?"&#xD;
I have particular instructions from him not to mention his&#xD;
whereabouts-all I dare say to you is that he is near and will see&#xD;
you soon. He is concealing his retreat for some purpose unknown&#xD;
to me-probably not wishing young Marshall to know he is still in&#xD;
the country.; I answered.&#xD;
Hubbard seemed greatly astonished ; I thought even I saw signs&#xD;
of fear ; he seemed much embar-rassed.&#xD;
" Do you say Dunnington will be here soon ?" asked he.&#xD;
Yes, returned 1'; in a couple of weeks at farthest.&#xD;
lie looked again at me and suddenly affected as much indifference&#xD;
as he had before shown of embarrassment, said :&#xD;

I was in turn greatly surprised.&#xD;

mn the old tower, and I carried her food and waited upon her myself.&#xD;
About a month since I went to her, apartment as usual, but found&#xD;
her not. How she escaped 1 don't know ;'but certain it is; she has&#xD;
gone, nor have I heard of her since. She has, without doubt,&#xD;
joined her lover, Marshall, if the robbers, who infest this' region,&#xD;
have ndt caught her on the way."                                     /&#xD;
My astonishment was extreme, for I knew not how th reconcile&#xD;
what I had read oni the tiles in the garden with what Hubbard said.&#xD;
There was some mystery about the affair which I was. impatient to&#xD;
fathom, yet.'I took good care not to exhibit the least doubt.&#xD;
These will be sad tidings to my uncle, sir, at length said I.'&#xD;
" Without doubt," he replied; " but Ircannot help it-it is not&#xD;
my fault."&#xD;
I have one favor to ask, Mr. Hubbard, said I, .which is this: the&#xD;
robber captain told me not to leave here for three days-may I.&#xD;
remain? iU&#xD;
" Certainly," said he ; " but where are your lodgings ? In the&#xD;
adjoining room, where the window looks out upon the garden ?"&#xD;
Yes I answered.&#xD;
" There you can remain, then," said he ; " but I must fasten hbe 4&#xD;
shutters well, for the' robbers must be close at hand, if they attacl~4,'~,&#xD;
you last evening. Now leave me and enjoy yourself as well as yo~&#xD;
can. You will find wine and refreshments in the kitchen."&#xD;
1 was anxious now to write to Cornelia, but how to do it I knew&#xD;
npt. Atliigth I thought of the negro, and a stratagem- which I&#xD;
put into execution served me admirably. I went to the kitchen&#xD;
where I found him, and politely asked him to be my companion in&#xD;
a-glass of wine. With this he complied, feeling much 'honored by&#xD;
-my asking him. One glass followed another until he became quite&#xD;
tipsy ; I myself playing the drunken man to perfection, although I&#xD;
was perfectly sober. At length I persuaded the fellow to take me&#xD;
.with him to his room, which he had said was in the tower. -A rude&#xD;
bed, a table and a chair, were the only articles of furniture in the&#xD;
room. After a little social chat, (for he was quite garulous,) he&#xD;
informed zne that his master was a grand old rascal, who had for-&#xD;
merly stolen negroes and sold them, and that he had robbed a&#xD;
widow lady of all her property. This said, he soon rolled on his&#xD;
bed and went to sleep. It was nearly dark, and I sat down at the&#xD;
table to write to my 'dear girl. I wrote her several pages, in which&#xD;
I vindicated my conduct in the convention ; and I swore that my&#xD;
love for her was still'of the most tender~ and respectful character.&#xD;
I told her to write to me freely all necessary explanations,- and 1&#xD;

would expose myself to every danger to put an end to ner horrible&#xD;
captivity.&#xD;
When this letter was closed I gave myself up to the most painful&#xD;
reflections. During the two hours the negro slept I put to myself&#xD;
many hundred questions, such as, " can it be Cornelia who threw&#xD;
missiles, or were they placed on the ledge of her window a month&#xD;
since, and are only now blown down by the wind ?" . After trying&#xD;
in vain to solve this and similar queries which thrust themselves&#xD;
upon my mind, my drunken companion awoke. It was quite dark,&#xD;
and he hurried me to the kitchen. Then I was shown to my room&#xD;
and the door closed. I lay upon the bed in a state of wretchedness,&#xD;
until I heard a clock strike twelve. I then softly attempted to open&#xD;
the'blinds, but to my utter astonishment an iron bar was placed&#xD;
across them from the outside ! I tried the door, but it, too, was&#xD;
fastened from without !&#xD;
This, said I aloud to myself, will insure my death !&#xD;
"Yes, without doubt," said some one, opening the door, " it does&#xD;
suree your death !"&#xD;
It was Hubbard ! He entered.&#xD;
" Traitor !" said he, darting at me a look of fury-" I know&#xD;
everything ! I know who you are and what you have been doing !&#xD;
Give me that letter you have written, or by the immortal heaven,&#xD;
I will pistol you on the spot !"&#xD;
The letter was lying on the bed, together with the paper, pen and&#xD;
ink, which I intended to send up by means of the string to Cornelia.&#xD;
He perceived them and took possession of them at once.&#xD;
"Now, Joe," said he to the negro, who just then entered the&#xD;
apartment, " help me to bind this fellow l"&#xD;
They precipitated themselves upon me, and soon bound my arms&#xD;
with cords, after doing which they retired, leaving me lying on the&#xD;
floor whither they had thrown me.&#xD;
My pen fails to place on paper anything like a correct description&#xD;
of the anguish into which I was plunged. My own misery was at&#xD;
its height, and the helpless situation of Cornelia, affected me forci-&#xD;
bly. How great would be her anxiety! She had expected me and  -&#xD;
would be disappointed ! But, no ! She knew me too well-she would&#xD;
never suspect me of deserting her ! She would judge me by herself.&#xD;
Such were my first cruel reflections.&#xD;
The next day some provision was brought in by the negro, but&#xD;
he spoke not. For twelve days I groaned in that horrid prison,&#xD;
receiving meanwhile barely sufficient food to sustain life, when at&#xD;
length I was brought, my arms still bound, before Hubbard, (n&#xD;

entering the room in which he was, I saw seated in an arm cha&#xD;
fainting female  It was Cornelia!: Tut, oh Qod! how chan&#xD;
yet how beautiful!&#xD;
Barbarian!: Monster! said I to Hubbard. At the sound of&#xD;
voice, Cornelia recovered her: consciousness.&#xD;
"Ah, my dear Charles !" fe said to me, "you do not k&#xD;
what that infamousmai proposes to me as a ransom foryour liberty&#xD;
"Yes-yes r" cried Hubbard, furiously. - You see he is in&#xD;
power. In three days he dies, unless you"-&#xD;
I tried to get to Cornelia's side, but the negro prevented me.&#xD;
Since I at length see you again, I said to her, all my sufferings&#xD;
forgotten, anddeath no longer has any power to aifright me. As&#xD;
- " 5 tyu, villain, (glancing a look of defiance at Hubbard,) retaen&#xD;
that Captain Dunnington lives and will revenge his daughter 1"&#xD;
"Take him awa!" cried Hubbard to the negro.&#xD;
" Ah !" said Cornelia, " my love has destroyed you!"&#xD;
it                                                            I wished to answer, but the black demon forcibly dragged&#xD;
fromn-the-room and back to my former prison.&#xD;
The scene of which I had been a witness, had at length confirm&#xD;
all in suspicions. It was evident that Captain Dunnington&#xD;
ignorant of the shameful treatment which his daughter had receive&#xD;
and:that, Hubbard, old as he was; was autorous and jealous, a&#xD;
that he determined to gratify his passion at whatever price.&#xD;
Ofthe:three days which Hubbardhd allowed Cornelia to deci&#xD;
two'passed away, and it was the middle of the night which precede&#xD;
h e third. I was unable to sleep and walked about the room,&#xD;
deavoring to rid myself of the cords which -still bound my wris&#xD;
in which I finally succeeded. I was pacing up and downthe apa&#xD;
ment with rapid strides, after I had freed my limbs, when sudden&#xD;
I heard. Hubbard's voice, crying-&#xD;
".Joe, get your gun ! Quick 1 The house is attacked!"&#xD;
Frightful noises now resouded on every side of the old building&#xD;
There was a great commotion within, and the old negro who h&#xD;
acted as sentinel at my room door, rushed away hurriedly. Present&#xD;
I heard the sound of many voices, among which I could distingui&#xD;
that of. Hubbard by its loud tone. Inow heard the report&#xD;
several guns, and the groans of some one in the agonies of deal&#xD;
, F /,//                                The noise for a moment was very great, but after a cry of trim&#xD;
din. Darted            the fearful uproar gave place to as fearful a silence. Soon a roa&#xD;

ADVENTURES OF CHARLES MARSHALL,&#xD;
&#xD;
I flew to the window. The flames were devouring the old castle !&#xD;
They approached on every side the room in which 'I was confined,&#xD;
and to complete the horror the mpst piercing screams proceeded&#xD;
from the tower where I knew Corneliawas imprisoned !&#xD;
The reader may well be penetrated with a sense of the horror of&#xD;
my situation. The fire, be oming more and more fierce, had reached&#xD;
my room;. and already the flames were battling around the foot of&#xD;
the tower, from whence Cornelia sent forth shriek upon shriek, to&#xD;
which I responded by cries of fury.&#xD;
Suddenly I heard the voice of Hubbard begging for mercy, and&#xD;
the tramping of feet in the passage near my door. I battered and&#xD;
kicked against it until those without heard me. They opened my&#xD;
prison with a blow of an axe, and one of them seized me. He was&#xD;
about to stab me with a dagger when I recognized in him the robber&#xD;
chief ! I threw myself at his knees and spoke to him. He remem-&#xD;
bered me.&#xD;
' Oh ! it is you, is it ?" said he.&#xD;
It is-it is, gasped I. But, oh, sir, there is a woman-my be-&#xD;
trothed-in that tower, and she will be burnt alive ! Let me out to&#xD;
assist her!&#xD;
" Go !" said he, and I rushed out and to the foot of the tower,&#xD;
where was lying a long ladder. With superhuman strength braised&#xD;
it and placed it against the wall. It barely reached the open win-&#xD;
dow at which Cornelia was now standing. I darted up with light.&#xD;
ning speed, and soon had her in my arms ! She was almost senseless&#xD;
from suffocation, and feebly asked-&#xD;
"Who comes to me?"&#xD;
It is I, Charles ! cried I, as I commenced descending with my&#xD;
precious burden, the flames meanwhile roaring around. Every step&#xD;
of the ladder trembled under my feet!&#xD;
Arrived at the foot of the burning tower, her joy at her deliver-&#xD;
ance renewed her strength. Several of the robbers now came up,.&#xD;
shouting-.&#xD;
"He's a brave fellow, and deserves her !"&#xD;
At this stage of the proceedings, the tower, as well as the sur.&#xD;
rounding walls, fell to the earth with a terrific crash, burying in its&#xD;
ruins the wounded negro, who lay groaning in agony in the garden.&#xD;
Then the robbers brought forth Hubbard. He v,.ts bound with&#xD;
cord.-Rage, terror, despair, everything which could rack the heart&#xD;
of a tortured villain, glowed in his rolling eyes. He beat the ground&#xD;
with his feet, and uttering horrible blasphemies, reproached heaven&#xD;
with its just vengeance.'&#xD;

&#xD;
la the meantime my beloved pressed my hand in hers.&#xD;
"Ah !" said she, " Charles, we have escaped but one evil! We&#xD;
are still in the hands of villains, for these men, I am sure, are the&#xD;
robbers of whom I have heard my persecutor,' Hubbard, so often&#xD;
speak. Perhaps worse than death awaits us&#xD;
No, no, Cornelia.--the robber-chief is my friend.&#xD;
"You speak aright I" said the leader, at this moment approach-&#xD;
ing us. " But come, tell me, you were in the lower room, and the&#xD;
lady was in the tower. Why was that ? I'll wager a bet that you,&#xD;
you rogue, were trying to carry off that maiden from that old&#xD;
butcher, there," pointing to Hubbard, "and you were right. He&#xD;
is a deep, black-herted villain, and she is beautiful. Come, explain&#xD;
this to me."&#xD;
I explained to him the particulars of our love up to the time I&#xD;
entered the castle, and the robber seemed satisfied so far as I was&#xD;
concerned; but he demanded of' Cornelia a history of her sufferings,&#xD;
first assuring her that we were both safe for the preseut. Wine&#xD;
was then offered us from a flask, of which we partook. Cornelia.&#xD;
then. spoke as follows:&#xD;
" When I was taken from home by my father, he brought me&#xD;
hither, and placed me in the care of' Hubbard. I have not seen&#xD;
him since. Some days after his departure, the visits of this wicked&#xD;
old man became more frequent and longer. Certain words which&#xD;
he uttered to me on one occasion, on bringing me food, led mne to&#xD;
suspect that his designs were infamous. He dared one day to: ex-&#xD;
plain them to me, and I assured him that my worst hatred only&#xD;
should be the return of his tenderness. He answered me coolly at&#xD;
the time, and said that, after a while I would become more accustom-&#xD;
ed to his presence, and suffer his assiduities, and even to desire&#xD;
them. Separated as I was from everything I loved, and closely&#xD;
confined by my tyrant, (for he informed me'[ was his prisoner,) I&#xD;
had not even the feeble consolation of being able to: give myself&#xD;
tranquilly the remembrance of my past happiness. The only wit-&#xD;
ness of my anxieties and miseries, he seemed to take pleasure in&#xD;
augmenting them. On one occasion he came to me and assured&#xD;
me that you, Charles, had been killed by my father. By the bar-&#xD;
barous joy he affected I believed the news to be true. Unpitying&#xD;
tyrant ! I cried to him. Leave me ! Leave me! He did so. About&#xD;
12 o'clock that night I heard my door softly opened, "and by the&#xD;
light of a lamp, which I always kept burning, I saw the tyrant ap-&#xD;
proaching my bedside. I had feared this, and' was, well prepared&#xD;
to prevent it. I had armed myself with a knife, which I had taken&#xD;

the precaution to conceal beneath my pillow. I heaped upon the&#xD;
accursed miscreantthe reproaches he justly merited, and vowed to&#xD;
bin that if he dared, to approach, I would stab him with my, own,&#xD;
hands. He recoiled with surprise and aifright.&#xD;
" I am tired of bearing your contempt !" said he in going out,,&#xD;
"and if I did not want you for something more pleasant, you would&#xD;
see what the arms of a woman could do against me. But I know&#xD;
a sure way to conquer your pride. Soon you shall think yourself&#xD;
too happy to purchase your pardon by the most humble submission !"&#xD;
"He went out; some moments afterwards the negro entered,&#xD;
pistol in hand. I must do him justice.-he wept in announcing to&#xD;
me the orders of his master.&#xD;
"mDress yourself, madame! You must follow me !"&#xD;
"'It was all he was able to say. He conducted me to the upper&#xD;
room in the tower, where, but for you, I would have perished. He&#xD;
locked me in that horrible prison; there I languished more than a&#xD;
month, without fire, without light, without clothes; with bread and&#xD;
water for mynourishment ; a simple pallet for my bed. Only one&#xD;
thing served  render my misery bearable.tI saw the tyrant no&#xD;
more. While he waited, tranquilly for me to solicit his pardon, I&#xD;
passed whole days and nights in calling upon my father and weeping&#xD;
for my lover Oh, Charles ! With what astonishment was I seized,&#xD;
with what joy was my soul penetrated the day that I recognized&#xD;
you in the garden.-&#xD;
The chief of the robbers listened attentively to the history of&#xD;
her misfortunes, with which he appeared deeply affected.&#xD;
All of a sudden a noise resembling the trampling of horses was&#xD;
heard. It was now daybreak, and on looking up I observed a crowd&#xD;
of mounted men approaching. The robbers, with the exception of&#xD;
the chief, immediately took to their heels and vanished. Hubbard'&#xD;
then cried-I&#xD;
" Ah ! You perfidious wretches ! You loving couple ! You still&#xD;
have not conquered me! The neighboring gentlemen have heard of&#xD;
my misfortunes and have come to succor me -"&#xD;
"They shall not, at all events, have the power to do more than&#xD;
avenge your death, villain !" said the robber, as he placed a pistol&#xD;
to his ear, and was about to despatch him, when Cornelia begged&#xD;
him not to do so. The gentlemen-on horseback now rode up, and&#xD;
at their head was Captain Dunnington ! As soon as he perceived&#xD;
me he cried :-&#xD;
" Wretch ! You have - not only betrayed me and my daughter.&#xD;

He jumped from his horse and pointed a pistol at me.. Cornelia&#xD;
prg for his arm as he fired it, and the contents entered the brain&#xD;
of Hubbard, who had by this time risen to his feet. Great was&#xD;
the consternation of those why assembled around the body of. Hub-&#xD;
bard as he lay dead. A stillness, the most dreadful, ensued. Taking&#xD;
advantage of this I asked Captain Dunnington, as well as the ba-&#xD;
lance of the company, to listen to a recital of Cornelia's sufferings,&#xD;
which I now begged her to give.g'&#xD;
This she did without hesitation, reciting what the reader already&#xD;
knows. Dunnington was deeply affected by the sufferings of his&#xD;
child, and instantly became sensible of the important service I had&#xD;
rendered her. Regarding me without wrath he appeared anxious&#xD;
for me to speak, which I now did.&#xD;
Captain, said I, do I not deserve Cornelia for my wife ? We have&#xD;
long loved each other. Give her to me, and bless us!&#xD;
"I Will, Charles!',' said he, smiling. " You deserv Pher, and I&#xD;
should have long since noticed it, had I not been blinded bypolitie.il&#xD;
ambition and a false sense of honor. She is yours take h&#xD;
be happy !"&#xD;
During this, the robber chief had glided from among us unno-&#xD;
ticed, and I have never seen him since.&#xD;
" Well, gentlemen," said one of those who had accompanied&#xD;
Cornelia's father, "who is this dead man, and what shall we do with&#xD;
him ?"&#xD;
" He is an old slave dealer, who has lived here many years in&#xD;
seclusion ; the particulars of his life are known to me alone. Fear.&#xD;
ing the halter for some of his bloody deeds, he broke jail many&#xD;
years ago in Rhode Island, accompanied. by a negro, and came here.&#xD;
I was then living in this neighborhood, and knew his secret from&#xD;
his own lips. I promised to save him from the officers of the law,&#xD;
provided he would lead an honest life in future, which he constantly&#xD;
assured me he was doing. I however heard, yesterd    that h&#xD;
robbed the children of a widow of this property by inducing her to&#xD;
sign a will in his favor when she was about dying. By that will hi.&#xD;
obtained the title to the old castle, or house, here now in ruins, ant&#xD;
which was the former residence of the lady, who took him and his.&#xD;
negro friend in out of charity. I wonder where the negro is no'w ? '&#xD;
He was shot by the robbers when they attacked the house, said&#xD;

I, and his body is doubtless now consumed, the walls of the burning&#xD;
building having fuller upon him, while he lay writhing in rain at&#xD;
the base of the towel.&#xD;
"tLet us adjourn to the town," said Captain Dunnington. "I&#xD;
must account for this man's death to the proper tribunal. You are&#xD;
all witnesses that I meant at least nt to kill him, although my pur-&#xD;
pose was a deadly one towards the preserver of my child !"&#xD;
Horses were furnished for Cornelia and myself from the still    -&#xD;
unharmed stabling of Hubbard, and the entire party started for the&#xD;
villageof Waynesboro', which was distant but a few miles. Arrived&#xD;
there, a coroner's jury returned to the body of Hubbard where an&#xD;
inquest was held on it. The verdict was "accidental shooting."-&#xD;
I made no complaint, of course, against my future father-in-law,&#xD;
and no further judicial proceedings were had.&#xD;
After a few days of rest, I led Cornelia to the altar, receiving&#xD;
her from the hands of her father. A week or two more found us&#xD;
at home, where my sisters gladly welcomed us. Since then we&#xD;
have enjoyed unalloyed happiness, sweetened by the -frequent re-&#xD;
currence to the sad misfortunes of. our early love.&#xD;
